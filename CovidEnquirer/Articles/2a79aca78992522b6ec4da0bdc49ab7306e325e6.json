            "text": "Heidi Schwarzwald, MD, MPH The number of children immigrating to the United States has increased steadily during the last decade. American families are adopting a significant portion of these children, more than 20,000. Recently immigrated children face many different health risks when compared to children born in the United States. They are subject to many infectious diseases no longer seen commonly in the United States such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV. They are more likely to have inadequate immunity to vaccine-preventable illnesses. Recent immigrants have a higher likelihood of having malnutrition and developmental delay. Finally, many will have suffered psychological trauma in either institutions or refugee camps. These children require specialized testing, care, and treatment in the pediatric office. Semin Pediatr Infect Dis 16:78-83 \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Of these, 186,328 were children younger than the age of 16 years. 1 This population will face many unique health risks when compared with the general pediatric population in the United States. This article will discuss many of the infectious diseases commonly diagnosed among recently immigrated children. Special attention will be given to those children who are being adopted internationally by citizens of the United States. Finally, this article will touch on some of the more common psychosocial needs of children immigrating to the United States, as these issues often require long-term intervention by the pediatrician.",

In 1993, 7,377 children were adopted internationally, compared with 21,616 in 2003. 2 Several factors account for the increase in international adoption. Domestically, parents placing children for adoption have more choices concerning who adopts their children, as well as increased access to information and contact with their biologic children. Some adoptive families are uncomfortable with this model. Also, awareness of the needs of children worldwide and a desire to provide a stable family for them have increased. Lastly, some misconception exists that children available for adoption from international settings are less likely to have been exposed to drugs or alcohol than are those available for domestic adoption. Of the children adopted in 2003, 32 percent were from China. The next most frequent country of origin was Russia, with 24 percent of the children originating from there. 2 Other countries included Guatemala, South Korean, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and India (Fig 1) .",

With the exception of children being adopted by American families, all permanent residents are asked to show proof of appropriate immunizations. What is appropriate is based on U.S. stan-dards, as well as what is available in the country of origin. 3, 4 Internationally adopted children are given a waiver, as long as parents sign a declaration that they will have all immunizations updated within a month of the child's arrival in the United States. 4 Because little screening is required before a child enters the country, further testing falls to practitioners taking care of newly immigrated children in the United States.",

The illness spread between countries in part because of international travel. The case fatality was 9.6 percent. 16 Since this initial outbreak occurred, researchers have predicted that SARS would continue to be a seasonal epidemic illness. However, 2004 brought only a few scattered cases of SARS, primarily in China. Several cases were associated with exposure during research activities with the virus. 16 The virus that causes SARS is a coronavirus (CoV) and is spread via respiratory droplets. Individuals are most contagious on the 10th day postexposure. The elderly and chronically ill are at highest risk for the development of severe complications. Diagnosing SARS requires clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological criteria. Clinical criteria for diagnosing SARS are divided into three categories: early, mild/moderate, or severe disease (Table 1 ). Laboratory confirmation requires the detection of antibody to SARS-CoV. Cell culture also can be used. An RNA polymerase chain reaction test has been developed to detect SARS-CoV, but at this time it is not accepted for definitive diagnoses. Lastly, the epidemiologic criteria are as follows: those who have traveled to an at-risk area in the last 10 days, or have had close contact with a known case, or have had close contact with someone who traveled to an at-risk area in the last 10 days. Taken together, these criteria can establish a probable or confirmed case of SARS. Patients recently immigrated from areas where a risk for SARS exists should be screened clinically with these criteria in mind.",

In addition to past medical history, as much as can be ascertained, an important factor to determine is in what countries a newly arrived immigrant has been living. Immigrants often have lived as refugees or temporarily in various countries before coming to the United States, which may change their risk for acquisition of various infectious diseases. Many immigrants may experience a change in their economic status. Some immigrants, such as refugees from refugee camps or internationally adopted children, will experience an increase in their economic fortunes. Others, such as those immigrating to escape political pressure, may experience a decrease in their economic earning power. Such changes will affect their health status as well as their ability to access health care. Lastly, any change in caregivers should be noted. Children often are the last members of a family to immigrate and, hence, their parents may not be the most recent caregiver. If such is the case, attempts should be made to obtain a medical history for the interim period (between when the parents left the country of origin and when the child did).",

One study reviewed the records of 504 internationally adopted children and found that only 178 had immunization records before being adopted. 18 Of these only 14 (9%) were up to date for all vaccines, according to the recommendations by AAP. Children from China were twice as likely to have incomplete records. 18 When a child presents with a vaccine record, it should be evaluated first for acceptability. A record is consider acceptable if it includes the date of administration for each vaccine, if the interval between doses is adequate (for most vaccines at least one month), and if the child was the appropriate age when vaccinated. Records have been evaluated that showed vaccines given before the child's date of birth-obviously rendering the entire record invalid! In other cases, vaccines may have been given when the child was younger than is recommended in the United States (ie, measles vaccine often is given when children are 9 months of age in endemic areas, as opposed to waiting until they are 1 year of age). In such cases, the particular vaccine may need to be repeated. If the record is thought to be acceptable and the child is older than 1 year of age, titers to confirm vaccination can be drawn. Care should be taken so that the appropriate tests are completed. For example, to confirm vaccination with hepatitis B, one must check a quantitative serum level, not just a qualitative value as seen with most acute hepatitis panels. If a child is younger than 1 year of age, vaccines should be repeated regardless of the records obtained. Titers measure the presence of antibodies, and maternal antibodies may cloud the issue in those younger than one year of age. The only caveat to repeating all vaccinations is that a child should not receive more than seven doses of diphtheria/tetanus before reaching 7 years of age.",

Researchers have estimated that for every 4 months spent in an institution, children will be 1 month delayed in all of their growth parameters (weight, height, and head circumference). 19 Growth delays are present for several reasons. Children from developing nations, especially from refugee camps or institutions, often have suffered from malnutrition, leading to failure to thrive. Moreover, children may experience growth failure secondary to psychological trauma. Children who are not nurtured often will grow poorly. For children being adopted internationally, fetal alcohol syndrome or other congenital illnesses often can be an additional cause of failure to thrive. For infants, one expects that their head circumference will be preserved better than will be the other growth parameters. If it is not, one must look closely for other signs of developmental delay. Developmental delay also is found very commonly in recently immigrated children. At least half of international adoptees have some form of developmental delay. A survey of 452 girls adopted from China found that 75 percent had some type of developmental delay and 44 percent had global developmental delay. 20 All of these children were evaluated within 3 months of arriving in the United States. Many children will overcome their delays and by 1 year after adoption will have \"caught up\" with their peers. However, some will exhibit delays or isolated deficiencies for their entire lives.",

When reviewing medical records of children adopted internationally, 30 percent had a maternal history of syphilis and 0.3 to 1.6 percent showed signs of infection. 7 In addition, screening for lead poisoning is recommended. Increased lead levels have been seen in children from various parts of the world. In Massachusetts, 693 recently immigrated children younger than the age of 7 years were evaluated for serum lead levels. Of these, 11.3 percent had elevated serum lead levels, twice as many as the U.S.-born controls. 21 This disparity remained on followup, possibly because of continued exposure in older U.S. housing. Thyroid function testing often is recommended. Many children come with no medical history and growth failure. One should rule out other treatable causes for growth failure and not assume all failure is due solely to nutritional shortages.
