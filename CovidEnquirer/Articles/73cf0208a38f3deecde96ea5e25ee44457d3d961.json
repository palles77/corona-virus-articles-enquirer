            "text": "The term \"poultry\" includes all species of birds that can be consumed for food. Traditional poultry species are the chicken, turkey, duck, and goose. Other species such as pheasants, quail, chukar partridges, pigeons, guinea fowl, and ratites have variable popularity dependent on cultural tradition, geographic location, and availability. \"Backyard\" or \"pet\" poultry loosely refers to any of the above species of birds that are maintained for pleasure and/or small-scale sale of birds, meat, or eggs. Often included are those birds owned by breeders and exhibitors of fancy poultry and small commercial operators selling to niche markets (e.g., live bird markets, range eggs, local production). In contrast, the commercial poultry industry is a billion dollar business involving large numbers of birds worldwide. The industry is split into meat (broiler chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese) and egglaying (table-egg and breeder) types of birds. Large meat-bird operations are generally vertically integrated-the company controls all aspects of production from hatch to processing. Chicken farms maintained for table-egg production are often individually owned, but may market their eggs cooperatively. Breeding is centralized with only a few primary breeders controlling the pedigreed genetic stock. Commercial companies often employ contract farms that are owned by an individual farmer; however, the birds belong to the larger commercial entity.",

Broiler is a meat chicken approximately 2.27 kg (5 pounds) live weight at slaughter and a roaster is a meat chicken 2.72 to 3.63 kg (6 to 8 pounds) live weight at slaughter. Chooks are the popular Australian term for chickens. A capon is a castrated male. Alektorophobia is the fear of chickens. The pecking order is a descriptive term for the dominance hierarchical system of the social organization in chickens. Chickens that have no feathers growing from their shanks are referred to as clean legged, whereas feather-legged breeds, such as Cochins or Brahmas, do have feathers. The crest refers to the puff of feathers on the heads of breeds such as Houdan, Silkie, or Polish, and is also called a \"topknot.\"",

            "text": "Poultry are adaptable to a wide variety of housing, and there are many designs to the buildings mostly because of aesthetic reasons rather than a specific need. Generally, the variables that should drive the choice of housing are climate, bird type, number of different species owned, and neighbors. Housing that has an outdoor component will require protection from predators with a fenced roof and fenced siding and side fences set into the ground at least 1 foot (30.5 cm). [1] [2] [3] Most adult poultry are able to withstand climate changes, with the exception of extremely hot or cold regions. If birds are not ill and are completely feathered (not in molt), heating of buildings is not required (certain breeds can be more cold resistant than others). In fact, housing is often sealed too tightly to retain heat, resulting in lack of adequate ventilation, which causes the onset of respiratory disease. Ventilation is crucially important in all climates. 2 If bird density is high, then better ventilation and more frequent cleaning are necessary. Lack of proper ventilation will result in the buildup of ammonia. High levels of ammonia destroy the cilia on the trachea and allow viruses and bacteria free entry into the lower respiratory tract. In hot climates, forced ventilation (fans) and misters may be necessary to reduce heat. Swamp coolers that cool air by forcing the air over cold water can be inexpensive and beneficial.",

For both types of heating, extra caution must be taken to not overheat the birds or cause a fire hazard from flammable materials (shavings and wood) touching a heat source. The flock behavior will be evidence of overheating. If the heat is a point source, birds will crowd away from the source. With central heat, the birds will crowd near exits, windows, and outside walls. If birds are housed entirely outside, a source of shade is necessary. If birds are raised for show, sun exposure can cause the feathers to change color and result in disqualification. All housing should be predator proof.

            "text": "It is always a good practice for clients to use the same degree of care in choosing the species and/or breed of poultry as they would exercise in choosing any other companion animal. 2,4 Commercial types of birds are genetically selected to optimize their function, meat or egg production, and should not be recommended for the average backyard operation. A commercial broiler is genetically selected to reach market weight in 6 to 7 weeks and will continue to grow if not processed at that time. Without significant feed restriction, \"old\" broilers will rapidly outgrow the ability of their legs and cardiopulmonary systems to support their weight. Most noncommercial chicken breeds are dual-purpose breeds that offer both good egg production and adequate meat. Generally, laying-type breeds are more active and lighter weight but can be more aggressive. Meat breeds are less commonly kept in backyard Probably the largest determinant to the decision of buying hatched chicks or hatching your own is the size of the flock that is desired. For small flocks, inexpensive incubator/ hatchers that are easy to operate are available either at farm stores or through mail-order catalogs. When first starting out, as many as 50% of the eggs may not hatch, making egg space a concern if a large hatch is needed. Most inexpensive incubators have good temperature control but inadequate control of humidity. 5 Chicken eggs can withstand shifts in humidity during incubation. Other species such as turkeys, however, are much more sensitive to fluctuations in humidity during incubation. In the commercial industry, chicken eggs are switched from the incubator to the hatcher at 18 days of embryonation (incubation to hatch 5 21 days). This is done primarily to keep down and egg debris from contaminating the incubators, to prevent chicks from falling to the bottom of the incubator, and to change temperature and humidity requirements between incubation and hatching.",

Occasionally chicks will hatch that have not completely absorbed their yolk sac and/or intestines. These chicks should be euthanized. Euthanizing newly hatched chicks to 10 days of age can be accomplished by cervical dislocation. One practical method is to take a scissors handle (ones that close completely opposed to each other), place directly behind the skull, and squeeze together to cervically dislocate.

If the flock size is large, about 25% of the flock can have \"formal instruction\" and those can be counted on to \"teach\" the rest. Instruction consists of dipping the beak into the water and then the feed. The appearance of the shiny drop of water and/or feed on the beak will also encourage exploration of these new objects by other chicks. It is best to place the feed into egg trays or flat low-sided dishes for the first week. Chicks continually peck at objects around their toes and will become familiar with the feed by this method. Feeding trays can be kept in the ring at the same time, and they will learn to eat from these gradually. Feeder trays are covered to keep the older chicks from scratching out feed and wasting it. In addition, older birds need feeders and waterers raised from ground level to be approximately equal to the thoracic inlet to help prevent fecal contamination. Waterers must have a small lip for the chicks to drink from, and it should be smaller if the species has tiny chicks. Generally waterers are bell shaped, allowing water from the center holder to refill the lip as needed. Water sources that are big enough for the chicks to fall into should be avoided. Newly hatched chicks are unstable on their feet and have trouble righting themselves if flipped over. This can result in mass drowning if waterers consist of open dishes. If this is a concern, placing brightly colored marbles or stones in the waterers reduces the depth of the water and the possibility of entrapment. Gradually, the feeders and waterers can be replaced with larger units to accommodate the growing birds.",

Scratch or single-source feeds (corn only) are not advisable unless used only as a supplement to the complete feed. Birds will preferentially eat the scratch, so it should not be offered until the nutritionally balanced feed is consumed. Laying birds must have calcium supplementation and layer ration. Another feed option is medicated feed. This is a general term used to describe feeds that have either anticoccidials or antibiotics added or both. For pet poultry, the addition of anticoccidials is recommended because of the prevalence of coccidiosis in backyard flocks. Feed containing antibiotics will need to be prescribed by a veterinarian, but these additives can be useful in situations where posthatch mortality is high from bacterial infections.",

Supplemented lighting will increase the risk of cannibalism in birds that are not individually caged. In general, light is progressively decreased throughout the growing period and is changed to a progressive increase at sexual maturity. The average targets for the start of increased lighting are 20 weeks for layer pullets and 23 weeks for meat pullets. These can vary depending on the season and the breed. Commercial chickens used for tableegg production are kept in lay for approximately 1 year and then are usually force molted. Broiler breeders rarely are kept in production longer than 44 weeks (layer breeders generally 52 weeks). Pullets used for table-egg production are usually caged and those used for production of hatching eggs are usually floor maintained with nest box access. Breeder pullets must be taught to use the nest box to prevent floor eggs.",

Often backyard flocks will undergo a 3-to 4-month or longer molt period. As long as feather loss is not associated with ectoparasite infestation, reddened or abraded skin, poor nutrition, or open wounds, an \"unusual molt\" can be assumed for lengthy or bizarre-appearing feather loss ( Figure 15-7) . All hens need to be molted after approximately a year in lay. Hens need this rest period to rebuild calcium and energy stores. If hens do not molt naturally, then reduction of light will usually stimulate them to do so. If desired, this is also the time period that hens can be culled from the flock. In general, even the best hens will only approach about 70% of their former production level in their subsequent production period. Chickens that are fed xanthophyll-containing feeds will continually blanch (skin, shanks, and beak) throughout lay. The vent in a laying hen will be larger, moist, and pliable compared with a small, hard, and puckered vent in a nonlayer. The easiest way to determine lay on farm is to palpate the pubic bones. The bones in a nonlayer almost meet just below the vent, whereas the layer will have a \"2 to 3 finger spread.\" The comb and wattles will be large, smooth, and firm in a layer and shriveled in nonlayers. When a hen lays an egg, her vent will evert to allow passage of the egg without contamination by feces. Once the egg is laid, her vent will usually return to the normal position quickly.",

States may require that chickens/turkeys entering the state be from NPIP participants, or be proven free of certain diseases.

The plan is administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and \"Official State Agencies\" (usually the poultry association in the State or the State Veterinarian). Producers sign onto state participation plans and the rules are outlined in the #9CFR Sections 145 and 147. Producers with farms in multiple states can establish cooperative agreements between the states. Backyard poultry owners who have breeding birds can become NPIP participants through Section E for exhibition birds.

Certain species such as pheasants and quail are notorious for cannibalism, often leading to the use of individual cages as the only housing option. Even within a species, certain breeds can be more aggressive than others. Cannibalism usually does not begin in earnest under 2 to 3 weeks of age. If observed in young chicks, it is generally the result of insufficient feed or diarrhea (soiled vents can be attractive pecking sites). In older birds, methods of controlling pecking and cannibalism include reduction of lighting, reduction of bird density, increased numbers of feeders, and trimming the beaks. If a bird has been pecked, spraying the affected area with pruning tar (used for trees) is a good, practical at-home solution. The tar protects the skinless area from fluid loss, is nontoxic even when used on open wounds, and has the advantage of \"identifying\" the perpetrators by staining their beaks black. Pruning tar can be used for large areas as long as the deeper body cavities have not been penetrated. More severe wounds may be treated with a variety of bandages, appropriate pain management, supportive care, and surgical closure. If small numbers of birds are the aggressors, these birds can be given red spectacles that attach to their nares or be fitted with red contact lenses (available at most poultry supply stores).",

Most adult poultry are highly resilient and seem to recover from extensive injuries. Supportive therapy that can be accomplished at home includes providing warmth (via brooder lamp), providing adequate hydration (powdered milk at half-concentration provides extra protein), and force-feeding warm molasses-sweetened feed. If a pet bird owner is force-feeding, he should select a soft, flexible feeding tube and place it into the esophagus just past the laryngeal opening. Since most poultry have a crop, the food will enter the crop first, allowing for a slower filling of the proventriculus. The tube should not be forced because lacerations of the cervical esophagus or crop and subsequent fungal/yeast infections can result ( Figure 15-8) . Aspiration and regurgitation are also risks associated with forcefeeding procedures. Wounds that are not penetrating into the respiratory or abdominal cavities can typically be treated with topicals and basic wound care and management procedures. Parenteral antibiotics may not be required for treatment of many wounds. Most poultry will show evidence of recovery in 2 to 3 days.

Primary foot trauma at the weight-bearing aspects of the foot is followed by secondary bacterial infections (Figure 15-9) . Staphylococcus sp. and Escherichia coli are the more commonly identified infectants. Heavy-bodied species are at the greatest risk, and trauma can be from puncture (direct inoculation) or from pressure necrosis. There is no age predisposition for bumblefoot, but common contributors to the condition include poor perch design, untrimmed claws, hypovitaminosis A, and poor weight management of birds. The epidermis is thicker in areas of pressure and plantar scabs inhibit healing and cause pressure ischemia. Heterophils can ingest Staphylococcus, but the enzymatic degradation is not efficient because of their lack of a specific lysozyme and dependence on other enzymes to kill bacteria. Acute infections are more often associated with caseous necrosis rather than purulent and liquefied exudate. Soaking the foot in magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) twice a day for 10 minutes can help remove the scabs. Topical antibacterials and bandaging are usually sufficient for most poultry. Appropriate analgesia should be a part of most treatment regimes. Pressure and weight-deferring bandages can add great benefit by functionally removing any further pressure on the lesions as they are treated and given time to heal. There is a direct venous return from the foot to the kidney in birds and oral antibiotics may be needed to prevent systemic infection.

Birds may die acutely (often from fractured spinal vertebrae and severed spinal cords) or can rapidly recover (4 to 7 days) after placement on the floor with easy access to food and water. With backyard poultry, treatment with intramuscular vitamin D 3 or intravenous calcium gluconate can be helpful. Where indicated, appropriate analgesia should be a part of the treatment plan. Oyster shell can be added to the diet ad libitum to prevent this condition. The oyster shell must not be ground so small that it passes through the intestinal tract because it needs to be retained in the gizzard. The strain of bird and type of housing also affect the incidence of the condition. The key is to ensure good nutrition (and good cortical bone formation) prior to onset of lay.

Coccidiosis is generally observed in young birds between the ages of 1 and 4 months. Birds under 1 week of age do not have chymotrypsin and bile salts for breaking apart oocysts and are not susceptible to disease. Coccidia are species specific. The disease causes diarrhea that is often bloody and frequently leads to death if not treated. Lesions in the intestinal tract vary with the species of coccidia involved, but the same treatment/preventive regimens can be used. Coccidia thrive in moist, heavily soiled litter and disease is often a result of too high a population density of birds. The kind of crowded housing found more often in winter months is an example of when population density may increase from acceptable to excessive. Poultry yards should be rototilled monthly after treatment with dilute bleach or lime to reduce oocysts available to birds. Prevention can be obtained by supplying coccidiostats in the feed. Coccidiostats are not included in organic feed, and these flocks must be monitored closely for coccidia. Outbreaks of disease can be treated with amprolium or with sulfadimethoxine (Albon) off-label. Sulfa drugs should not be used in laying hens. Amprolium has a very narrow margin for error and overdoses can lead to hemorrhagic diathesis and death. Vaccines are available but are generally only used in commercial birds in ovo or at hatch.

The chicken cecal worm, Heterakis gallinarum, and earthworms are accessory hosts. Turkeys become infected by eating infected Heterakis eggs or earthworms containing juvenile heterakids. Direct transmission through feces is uncommon because of low survivability of histomonads when unprotected by Heterakis eggs. Losses are greatest in turkeys (especially under 3 months of age) but Histomonas can infect chickens, pheasants, chukars, ruffed grouse, peafowl, guinea fowl, bobwhite quail, and pheasants. The natural incubation period is 7 to 12 days and mortality in turkeys can approach 100% and morbidity is 80% to 90%. Recovered birds may continue to harbor histomonads in their ceca. Affected turkeys have sulfur-colored feces; depressed, drooping wings; and a stilted gait. Although the disease is called blackhead, not all turkeys will have a cyanotic head. Chickens often have an unapparent infection without sulfur-colored feces but can have blood in the feces. Leukocytosis, decreased uric acid and hemoglobin, transient rise in blood sugar, and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are usually seen. The gross lesions are primarily in the ceca and liver. Lesions in the ceca include enlargement, thickened hyperemic walls, caseous luminal cores, and ulceration of the mucosa. Lesions in the liver commonly have circular, depressed areas of necrosis circumscribed by a raised ring (targets). Diagnosis is generally based on clinical signs and gross lesions. Demonstration of histomonads in ceca from freshly killed birds is difficult because the histomonads die quickly and are harder to identify. The best prevention is not to place turkeys on ranges inhabited previously by chickens or other game birds and to control earthworms. Range rotation is not practical as histomonads have tremendous survivability in heterakid eggs (4 years or more). There are no vaccinations or treatments available in the United States, since the use of imidazoles has been banned in all foodproducing animals.",

The cups in the two sticks deposit the vaccine into the thin tissue of the wing web. Approximately 7 to 10 days post vaccination the area is checked for two small bumps at the inoculation site called \"takes.\" With turkeys and other birds that sleep with their heads under their wings, the vaccine should be applied to the drumstick after parting the feathers.

AE can be transmitted vertically in eggs laid between 5 and 13 days post infection, and it is an enteric infection under natural conditions. The spread is more rapid in floorraised birds than in cage-raised birds. Clinical signs include central nervous system deficits such as spinning, seizure-like activity, and torticollis. Mortality can be 50% or more and recovered chicks may be permanently blind in one or both eyes. Chicks hatched from recovered birds may also have blindness for unknown reasons, so keeping recovered birds for breeding is not recommended. There is no treatment. Vaccination of the breeders (both chicken and turkey) provides maternal antibodies for the young that are critical for prevention of infection. Since many specialty breeders, particularly those that sell stock to feed stores or other secondary distributers, do not vaccinate, AE is a fairly common viral disease in backyard birds. Vaccination should be given after 8 weeks of age but by at least 4 weeks prior to production. The vaccine can be co-applied with the pox vaccine using the stab-stick method.",

Waterfowl can shed for long periods and often do not have detectable seroconversion whereas chickens and turkeys generally stop shedding after seroconversion. Transmission occurs via the respiratory tract and feces, and the incubation period is from a few hours to 3 days. Influenza is caused by an orthomyxovirus with three antigenically distinct types: A, B, and C. It is typed by the antigenic nature of the nucleoprotein and matrix antigens. Type A is classified into subtypes based upon the hemagglutination and neuraminidase types and B and C occur only in humans. The standard nomenclature is name 5 type of host (except human), geographic origin, strain number, year of isolation, and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) category. As with velogenic NDV, HPAI should be considered in any cases of acute mortality involving many birds. However, screening for LPAI is of national importance for HPAI prevention in both commercial and backyard flocks. The NPIP has an LPAI program and individual states often have monitoring programs for both resident and imported birds. Testing is done either by a direct antigen test or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on swabs from the choanal cleft (gallinaceous birds) or cloaca (waterfowl) or an agar gel immunodiffusion test conducted on either serum or egg fluid. Serology and direct antigen tests are generally used for screening and PCR is used for confirmation. Flocks positive by screening tests must have samples sent to an accredited laboratory for PCR confirmation. If it is H7 or H5, the samples are sent by the laboratory to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL). All flocks confirmed positive for either LPAI or HPAI will be depopulated. No vaccination for AI is permitted in the United States without permission from the USDA.",

S. pullorum is egg transmitted and causes a diarrheal disease in young chicks and poults resulting in high mortality. Adult birds are asymptomatic carriers. Diagnosis is based upon disease history and isolation of the bacteria. Prevention is achieved by purchasing birds from disease-free flocks. Treatment is not recommended because it can cause birds to become carriers. Fowl typhoid (S. gallinarum) occurs in chickens and turkeys and many other game and wild birds. Fowl typhoid is similar in disease presentation and diagnosis to pullorum, although mature birds can show clinical signs of fowl typhoid. Prevention is again achieved by obtaining disease-free stock (NPIP certified). As with LPAI, small flock owners can participate in NPIP and have birds tested for pullorum/typhoid (PT) for show and breeding purposes. PT testing can be conducted by certified trained individuals or veterinarians, and consists of taking a small blood drop from the wing vein and conducting a plate agglutination test right on the farm (Figure 15-16) . Commercial PT antigen and equipment are available for purchase by the public, and the USDA provides a training DVD (Figure 15-17) .

Clinical signs of respiratory disease develop slowly in a flock, and feed consumption drops (Figure 15-18) . Infection of the sinuses is common in turkeys. Since there are no certified MG-clean noncommercial breeders, it is crucial that clients only purchase birds from a reputable supplier or to visit the farm before purchase to be sure the birds are free of respiratory diseases. Serology, PCR, and isolation and identification of the organism can be used for diagnosis. An on-farm plate test, similar to that for PT, is available for screening purposes. Both live and killed vaccines are available, but the use of live vaccines may need State or Provincial approval. Killed vaccines can be effective for preventing/reducing clinical signs but will not prevent the birds from transmitting the disease vertically or horizontally. Depopulation and restocking is advised for breeding flocks. Treatment is expensive and the disease often recurs after cessation of treatment. Either injectable or feed/water-based Tylosin is the best approved treatment. It can be used for up to 1 month but egg and meat withdrawal times must be observed. MG is a reportable disease in turkeys in some states and provinces, and depopulation may be required.

            "text": "Rickets is the term used for younger birds and osteomalacia for mature birds. In poultry, the etiology is a deficiency or imbalance of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D 3 . Lesions include a soft and pliable beak, claws, and keel; beading of the ribs; enlarged epiphysis; fractures of the long bones and spine; and enlarged parathyroid glands. Vitamin D 3 deficiency can be treated with three times the normal levels of vitamin D 3 provided in the feed or liquid vitamin D 3 in the water for 2 to 3 weeks. Calcium and phosphorus levels need to be adjusted for the species, breed, reproduction status, and age levels of the birds.",

Gross lesions include subcutaneous green-tinged fluid and pale streaks in the skeletal muscles, gizzard, and heart; degeneration of the skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle; and pancreatic acinar necrosis. Encephalomalacia can be prevented by providing synthetic antioxidants in the feed but there is no treatment. Muscular dystrophy can be treated by adding cysteine to the feed and exudative diathesis is treated by adding selenium to the feed. For individual birds, a single oral dose of 300 IU of vitamin E is effective.",
