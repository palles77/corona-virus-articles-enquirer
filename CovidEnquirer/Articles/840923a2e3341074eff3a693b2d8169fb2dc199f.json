This study attempted to identify viruses from the upper respiratory tract in adults visiting emergency departments for clinically suspected CAP. Adults with suspected CAP enrolled in the ESCAPED study (impact of computed tomography on CAP diagnosis) had prospective nasopharyngeal (NP) samples studied by multiplex PCR (targeting 15 viruses and four intracellular bacteria). An adjudication committee composed of infectious disease specialists, pneumologists and radiologists blinded to PCR results reviewed patient records, including computed tomography and day 28 follow up, to categorize final diagnostic probability of CAP as definite, probable, possible, or excluded. Among the 254 patients enrolled, 78 (31%) had positive PCR, which detected viruses in 72/254 (28%) and intracellular bacteria in 8 (3%) patients. PCR was positive in 44/125 (35%) patients with definite CAP and 21/83 (25%) patients with excluded CAP. The most frequent organisms were influenza A/B virus in 27 (11%), rhinovirus in 20 (8%), coronavirus in seven (3%), respiratory syncytial virus in seven (3%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in eight (3%) of 254 patients. Proportion of rhinovirus was higher in patients with excluded CAP compared with other diagnostic categories (p = 0.01). No such difference was observed for influenza virus. Viruses seem common in adults attending emergency departments with suspected CAP. A concomitant clinical, radiological and biological analysis of the patient's chart can contribute to either confirm their role, or suggest upper respiratory tract infection or shedding. Their imputability and impact in early management of CAP deserve further studies. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT01574066. Clinical Microbiology and Infection",

The conventional microbiological techniques, such as culture, serology, antigen detection, have practical challenges, notably, complex technology, poor sensitivity and prolonged turnaround time. Since the advent of PCR, the advances in these new molecular techniques have shown their applicability to improve the detection of agents causing various types of infections. The multiplex PCR method allows the potential amplification of many nucleic acid targets within a single reaction and has proven to be an attractive diagnostic method for multi-pathogen detection in respiratory tract infections [9, 10] .",

Of note, the adjudication committee based its judgement not only on follow-up data, but also on systematic day 0 thoracic CT scan, which is unique. The value of 35% PCR-positive patients with definite CAP is in agreement with several studies without an adjudication committee, which reported detection of viruses in a substantial proportion of patients with CAP. Jennings [2] [3] [4] 13] . The most frequently detected viruses in our study were influenza A/B virus and rhinoviruses, as reported in previous studies [14] . Like our study, these reports addressed patients with an approximately similar rate, 28-32%, of coexisting conditions. Paediatric studies identified viral infections by real-time PCR in 28% of hospitalized patients, increasing to 50% in those with asthma [14, 15] . The frequency and distribution of viruses detected were slightly different in two recent studies of patients in intensive care units and of elderly adults with moderate to severe illness [16, 17] . These differences may partly be due to differences in viruses circulating in the community during the study period or to the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic technology used. The seasonal distribution of detected pathogens in our study was similar to that observed in the community French surveillance network of patients with influenza-like illness in 2012-2013 (V Enouf, Institut Pasteur, personal communication). All of these findings confirm the major changes induced by molecular techniques in describing CAP-associated microorganisms; in comparison, a review of 26 prospective studies in ten European countries (approximately 6000 patients), published in 1998 before the wide use of PCR, found respiratory viruses accounted for only 8% of patients with CAP [18] .",

It is important to admit that multiplex PCR may have different analytical sensitivities for different viruses, which would affect the diagnostic yield. It is interesting to underline that the eight patients with PCRdetected M. pneumoniae had definite CAP, reinforcing the interest of this test in the context of M. pneumoniae epidemics. The 25% PCR-positive patients among those with an excluded diagnosis of CAP might be explained by the fact that the infection was localized in the bronchi and the upper respiratory tract and did not affect the pulmonary parenchyma. This could also be explained by the PCR detection of viral shedding in patients with other diseases mimicking CAP symptoms [19] . In our study, the higher proportion of rhinoviruses in patients with excluded CAP suggests that at least part of these rhinoviruses were either viral shedding or could be associated with limited upper respiratory tract infection, as suggested previously in symptomatic and asymptomatic children and adults [20] [21] [22] . The seasonal distribution of influenza A/B virus detection and the similar proportion in excluded and non-excluded CAP suggest that pneumonia is not the primary manifestation of influenza, as already known [23] . Another hypothesis for this high rate of positive PCR in excluded CAP may be that some patients with minimal or early lesions of CAP could present with a normal CT scan, as has been known for a long time for chest X-rays.",

            "text": "The epidemiology of CAP in adults has probably changed in recent years because of the indirect impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children [24] . However, establishing the aetiology of CAP remains difficult and the imputability of pathogens detected in the upper respiratory tract remains questionable. As in the present study, no cause is determined in half or more of the patients. Even considering the limit related to the routine non-standardized sampling for bacterial investigations in the study, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most commonly identified bacteria associated with CAP, as is generally recognized. The rate of detection of other bacteria, and atypical agents was similar to that reported in a recent review [24] . Respiratory viruses, particularly influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, are commonly detected in patients with CAP as described here [14] . However, it remains challenging to differentiate viral CAP from mixed-infection or bacterial CAP. It is a hypothesis that the increasing recognition (15-54%) of viruses as a cause of CAP in adults may reflect advances in viral detection by PCR-based testing. Better ways to diagnose viral CAP would increase the use of targeted antiviral therapies. Specifically, detection of influenza virus should lead to consideration of antiviral therapy within the 48 h after onset of symptoms, which has been shown to improve prognosis [23] . It can be useful to establish the virological diagnosis for epidemiological purposes in hospitalized patients who may require infection control measures to prevent nosocomial transmission, especially in the case of a new and/or contagious virus outbreak, such as the recent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak [25] . Whether the rapid viral diagnosis is likely to change individual antibiotic management and reduce antibiotic overuse has to be studied [24, 26] . Nevertheless, the relatively low sensitivity of the test and the high cost issues need to be addressed before widespread use of the multiplex PCR method. The current study had several limitations. The multiplex PCR (RespiFinder-19) assay was not performed in real time, a limitation that may have underestimated identification of viral agents. However, this assay is generally considered to be as sensitive as monoplex PCR, which suggests that such a delay is not a major determinant of false-negative results [27] . One major issue is that the PCR test did not include S. pneumoniae, the leading organism of CAP, as a target [3, 24, 28, 29] , which precludes comments on the respective roles of S. pneumoniae and viruses as CAP agents in our study. Using sputum samples in adult patients attending ED, Yang et al. found that PCR assay might be a useful diagnostic adjunct for clinicians to detect a pneumococcal pneumonia [30] .",

We gratefully acknowledge the invaluable contribution of the members of the adjudication committee. We are grateful to Gilles Collin for performing PCR tests and to Philippe Guerin for scientific discussions. We thank Berangere Gallet de Saint Aurin for her assistance in database construction and in data management and Melanie Huet for secretarial assistance. *Investigators participating to the adjudication committee did not validate the cases from their own centre.",
