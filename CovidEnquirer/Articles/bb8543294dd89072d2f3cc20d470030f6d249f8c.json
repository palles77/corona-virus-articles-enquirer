An aqueous extract of H. cordata tea showed high radical scavenging activity determined by off-line DPPH assays. Then, it was screened for its antioxidant components via an on-line DPPH radical scavenging technique coupled with a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (LC-ESI-MS). Based on their mass spectra and fragmentation patterns; the antioxidant compounds were identified as quinic acid derivative, caffeic acid derivatives, procyanidin B, neo-chlorogenic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, crypto-chlorogenic acid and quercetin hexoside. LC-MS/MS in multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode was used to quantify these antioxidant compounds. Chlorogenic acid was found to be a major component in H. cordata tea.",

            "text": "Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) is a pungent, heartlike leafed perennial herb native in Southeast Asia. It is called in Thai as Khao-tong or Plu-khao which means fishy smelling vegetable. Despite its unpleasant smell, young leaves of H. cordata are popular vegetable in the Northern part of Thailand. It also has been used in traditional medicine for immune stimulization and as anticancer agent. H. cordata shows a variety of pharmacological activities such as anti-hypertension, and seems to have anti-edema, detoxicant, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, anti-purulent and diuretic activities (Lu, Liang, Yi, & Wu, 2006; Probstle & Bauer, 1992) . Additional activities of H. cordata against allergy, anaphylaxis, cancer and viral infection were reported (Chiang, Chang, Chen, Ng, & Lin, 2003; Kwon et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005) . Hayashi, Kamiya, and Hayashi (1995) reported that it showed direct inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus type I, influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) without showing cytotoxicity to the host. Moreover, Chiang et al. (2003) reported that H. cordata had selective activity against herpes simplex HSV-2. In the anti-viral aspect, H. cordata exhibited significant inhibitory activity on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Lau et al., 2008) . H. cordata also acted as an antioxidant and antimuta-genic agents (Chen, Liu, Chen, Chao, & Chang, 2003) . In general, the chemical components of H. cordata comprise of six major types, namely: volatile oils, flavonoids, alkaloids, fatty acids, sterols and polyphenolic acids (Bansiddhi et al., 2003; Ch, Wen, & Cheng, 2007; Meng et al., 2007; Toda, 2005) . In the beginning, most of the studies mainly focused on the chemistry of the essential oils which have been considered to be responsible for the claimed clinical efficacy (Hayashi et al., 1995) . Recently, Meng et al. (2005) developed an HPLC-DAD-MS method for analysis of H. cordata and characterized its major active chemical constituents as chlor- glucopyranoside, rutin, hyperin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, afzelin, quercetin, piperolactam A, and aristolactam B. Antioxidants are usually found as complex mixtures in plant extracts. The on-line-HPLC coupled with the detection of antioxidative activity using post-column reaction of eluates with free radicals have been reported that they can be successfully applied for the identification and quantification of antioxidants in biological samples (Niederl\u00e4nder, van Beek, Bartasiute, & Koleva, 2008; Nuengchamnong & Ingkaninan, 2009) . Beside these, a free radical spiking technique also showed good detection efficacy (Shui, Leong, & Wong, 2005 The main objectives of this study were, therefore, to screen the antioxidants in H. cordata and to further identify and quantify those compounds using LC-MS coupled with DPPH assay.",

Line A; Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) is coupled to a PE SCIEX API 4000 triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystem, Foster city, CA) equipped with electrospray ionization interface. The chromatographic separation was achieved by a phenomenex Gemini column (5 lm, 250 \u00c2 4.6 mm i.d.) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) protected with an ODS C18 guard column, operated at 25\u00b0C. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (1 ml formic acid in 1 l of deionized water) and solvent B (methanol). The elution program started from 90:10 solvent A: solvent B for 4 min, then changed to 80:20 solvent A: solvent B in 6 min, and linearly increased to 10:90 solvent A: solvent B in 30 min and the ratio of solvent A: solvent B was constant at 10:90 for 5 min then changed to 90:10 solvent A: solvent B in 5 min and was kept constant at 90:10 solvent A: solvent B for 5 min for reconditioning of the column. Mass spectra were recorded within 55 min. The injection volume was 5 ll. The flow rate was set at 600 ll/min. The Analyst 1.3.2 software was used for data acquisition and processing. The full scan mass spectra from m/z 100-1000 amu were acquired both in positive and negative ion modes. The optimum conditions of the interface were as follows: ESI-positive; ion spray voltage of 4500 V, curtain gas of 69 Kpa (10 psi), ion source gas 1 of 450 Kpa (65 psi), ion source gas 2 of 380 Kpa (55 psi). The interface temperature was set at 400\u00b0C. The entrance and declustering potential were 10 and 80 V, respectively. ESI-negative; the condition was similar to ESI positive except the voltage was set in negative mode. Line B represents the continuous flow system for antioxidant activity detection. It consisted of an HPLC pump, LC20AD prominence (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), home-made knitted reaction coil PEEK tubing with an inner diameter of 180 lm and a total reaction coil volume of 100 lL. The flow of 0.1 mM DPPH was set to 200 ll/ min and the reduction was detected as a negative peak at 515 nm using the UV-VIS detector (SPD 20AV, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The residence time in the coil is 0.45 min. The LC solution software was used for data acquisition and processing. The polarity of the signal output was reversed in order to obtain positive signals. The system was operated at 25\u00b0C. Line A coupled to line B with a 24 cm length of 0.17 mm i.d. PEEK tubing by a Y-connector. The eluent flow was split in a ratio of 8:2 between the MS ion source and DPPH line. For the characterization of antioxidant peaks, the fragment ions from their corresponding parent ions in negative mode were induced with collision gas (CAD) of 41 Kpa (6 psi), collision energy (CE) between \u00c05 and \u00c050 V and collision cell exit potential (CXP) of \u00c06 V, DP in the range of \u00c020 to \u00c0110 V. In positive mode, the ions were induced with CAD of 48 Kpa (7 psi). CE, CXP and DP were set in the range of 5-25, 3-13 and 20-100 V, respectively. Quinic acid and kaempferol at a final concentration of 100 lg/ml were added to the sample to synchronise an antioxidant peak in line B with the MS peak in line A. ",

The system was employed from solvent A:B (90:10) to (10:90) in 10 min, followed by isocratic elution with solvent A:B (10:90) for 5 min and linear gradient elution from solvent A:B (10:90) to (90:10) for 2 min and equilibration with solvent A:B (90:10) in 3 min before injecting a new sample. The flow rate was set at 600 ll/min. The injection volume was 5 ll. The MS parameters were operated in negative multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) scan mode. Optimal operating parameter of ESI-MS with maximum signal intensity of molecular ions and fragment ions were obtained by direct infusion of the standard solution at concentration 10 lg/ml in methanol, using a Harvard syringe pump (Syringe Pump 11 plus, Harvard apparatus Inc., Holliston, USA) at a flow rate of 5 ll/ml. The optimum conditions of the interface were as follows: ion spray voltage of \u00c04500 V, curtain gas of 138 Kpa (20 psi), ion source gas 1 of 380 Kpa (55 psi), ion source gas 2 of 310 Kpa (45 psi). The interface temperature was set at 400\u00b0C. The entrance potential was \u00c010 V. The dwell time per transition was set at 100 ms. The individual optimized parameters for detection of each compound are as follows. For chlorogenic acid, the transition at m/z 353.2 ? 190.8 amu with DP, CE and CXP of \u00c0120, \u00c022 and \u00c030 V were set. Catechin was detected at two transitions. At m/z 288.9 ? 245.0, DP, CE and CXP were set at \u00c0150, \u00c022 and \u00c012 V, respectively. At m/z 288.9 ? 125.1 amu, DP, CE and CXP were set at \u00c0150, \u00c030 and \u00c020 V. For quercetin, the two transitions were set at m/z 300.9 ? 151.0 amu and m/z 300.9 ? 178.9 amu. The DP and CE for both transitions were set at \u00c0150 and \u00c030 V. The CXP was set at \u00c022 for m/z 300.9 ? 151.0 and at \u00c026 V for m/z 300.9 ? 178.9 detection. Chlorogenic acid, catechin and quercetin in various concentrations were used for preparation of calibration curves. The curves were generated by linear regression based on the peak area. Analyses were performed in triplicate. Other standards were not available; hence neo-chlorogenic acid and crypto-chlorogenic acid were quantified as chlorogenic acid equivalents and also procyanidin B and quercetin hexoside were quantified as catechin and quercetin equivalents, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined as the analyte signal having a peak area equal to three times of that of noise (S/N = 3) using Analyst software.",

The antioxidant activities of the methanolic extracts of O. grandiflorus, H. cordata, M. alba and V. cinerea were expressed as EC 50 values of 217.2 \u00b1 12.6, 341.5 \u00b1 17.2, 874.9 \u00b1 83.4 and 886.9 \u00b1 53.1 lg/ml, respectively. The positive controls BHA, ascorbic acid and Trolox gave EC 50 values of 4.5 \u00b1 2.1, 6.7 \u00b1 0.2 and 7.9 \u00b1 1.3.
