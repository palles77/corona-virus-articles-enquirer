In the first phase, a graphtheory-based approach was developed to update partial data available and in the second phase, we used this partial data to generate plausible complete data through wavelets. We have provided two numerical examples. This procedure is novel and implementable and adaptable to machine learning modeling framework.",

As we know, preparedness for the epidemic spread is a primary public 31 health concern for any health department. Epidemic reporting of a disease is a fundamental 32 event in understanding two key parameters in epidemiology, namely, epidemic diffusion within then after 21 days, these individuals will (unknowingly) spread the virus to others. There are 42 other viruses whose incubation period is short but they are contagious during this period, 43 for example, influenza. Even for epidemics with established symptoms, reporting could be 44 nowhere close to complete. The impact of reporting on epidemic surveillance can then be 45 theoretically measured (Rao, 2012) . 46 Wavelet theory was developed fairly recently (about 35-40 years ago), but applications 47 of wave functions fitted to epidemic data were seen more than 60 years ago (for example, 48 Soper (1929), Bartlett (1956) and Bartlett 1957) . The observations by Bartlett (1957) on 49 population size and the fraction of measles infecting people over various time points provided 50 a new basis for using stochastic models for understanding retrospectively the seasonality of 51 epidemics. This study by Bartlett (1957) and other studies (for example, see the summary 52 in the book by Anderson and May (1991) ) consider wave-like fitting of a time series data of 53 epidemics. Bartlett , in his articles [3, 4] considered two differential equations to investigate 54 small oscillations around the equilibrium. Earlier than this, a stochastic formulation of such 55 models was seen by Soper in his paper [18] . 56 Suppose i(t) and s(t) represent infected and susceptible numbers at time t. A simple ODE 57 considered by Bartlett ( which was improvisation of the model by Soper [18] ) to explain the ",

As the reported number of cases increases and it approaches towards the number of 212 complete/actual cases, then the graph G i would ideally expand (in terms of vertices and 213 edges) towards G c i . We refer here to this process as convergence. That is, the structure of 214 two graphs G i and G c i get closer. In G c i the number of vertices is the number of actual disease 215 cases and the edges are connected between the closest vertices. In reality, G c i is not possible 216 to draw because we would not be able to observe all cases. It is challenging to understand 217 beforehand what fraction of the size of G c i would be the size of G i , and this guess could give 218 the speed of convergence to G c i from G i . The actual time steps taken from G i to G c i for each i 219is not constant. We assume that there will be a finite number of time steps to reach from G i 220 to G c i . Usually c is not constant as well because the error rates vary so we let c 0 correspond 221 to complete reporting at t 0 , c 1 at t 1 , and so on up to c n at t n . Let G t 0 i be the graph at t 0 Total reported cases within an interval of time could be formed from sample cases out of total cases. We drew graphs using black colored filled circles in this Figure to represent total reported cases in a few of the situations out of all possible diseases reporting patterns. The sample point of reported cases represents the total reported cases at each time interval. Hence the size of all graphs at each interval was kept the same. Similarly, the size of graphs between different time intervals is kept different for demonstration purposes only and actual reported cases between different time intervals could be constant or not.

Because we are dealing 308 with true versus reported disease cases, this measure (a set of points each representing a 309 distance between true and observed cases) could be termed the error in the reporting of 310 disease cases. These kinds of measures will be very helpful (such measures after further 311 filtration can be useful for practical epidemiologists). Instead of constructing wavelets for 312 the overall epidemic duration, we will construct wavelets within intervals [t 0 , t 1 ] and (t i\u22121 , t i ] 313 for i = 2, 3, ..., n described as inFigure 4.3. As the reported cases within an interval improve, 314 described as inFigure 4.5, the wavelet configuration improves. Each of the fractional wavelets 315 obtained from partial data will be updated using the information shown inFigure 4.7. Meyer 316 wavelets for various equally spaced intervals are demonstrated in Figure 4.8.",

This study develops methodologies of constructing complete data from partial data using wavelets (by partial data here we mean incomplete data that typically arises under an emerging epidemic, for example, in the novel coronavirus of 2019 or COVID-19). Our approach will be useful in deep learning of very large data structures and creating complete data from partial data. During most of the emerging epidemics, we will be handling only partial data, corresponding full data would be seldom available. The the number of infected people reported against time points.
