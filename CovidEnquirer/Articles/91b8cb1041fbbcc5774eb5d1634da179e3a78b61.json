Within months of the SARS outbreak, collaborative work revealed the identity of the disastrous pathogen as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, although the rapid identification of the agent represented an important breakthrough, our understanding of the deadly virus remains limited. Detailed biological knowledge is crucial for the development of effective countermeasures, diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral drugs against the SARS-CoV. This article reviews the present state of molecular knowledge about SARS-CoV, from the aspects of comparative genomics, molecular biology of viral genes, evolution, and epidemiology, and describes the diagnostic tests and the anti-viral drugs derived so far based on the available molecular information.",

In mid-April 2003, the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) Genome Science Center in Canada (12 ) , the Center of Disease Control in the United States (13 ) and the University of Hong Kong (14 ) announced at nearly the same time that the complete genome sequence of the SARS-CoV had been isolated in the corresponding areas (15 ) . The results of independent sequencing of the SARS-CoV genome all indicated that it was a polyadenylated genomic RNA of 29.7 Kb in length. Comparative analysis of the genome with other coronaviruses suggested that the virus genome was very similar to previously characterized coronaviruses, with the order (starting from the N-terminal): replicase (R), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) gene, where there are few accessory genes or motifs spanning between the structural genes and at the 3 UTR (untranslated region), which may not be necessary for viral replication (12 ) . The replicase gene, with two open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b, covering more than two thirds of the genome, is predicted to encode only two proteinases (12 -14 ) that regulate both the replication of the positive-stranded genomic RNA and the subsequent transcription of a nested set of eight subgenomic (sg) mRNAs (Table 1; ref. 16 ), which is a common transcription strategy adopted by coronavirus members (17 -21 ) .

These procedures elucidated the leader sequence and the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS). The leader sequence found in the viral sg mRNA tran-scripts is at least 72 nucleotides long. Through the alignment of the leader sequence at the 5 end of the eight sg mRNAs, there is a minimal consensus TRS, namely, 5 -ACGAAC-3 , which participates in the discontinuous synthesis of sg mRNAs as a signaling sequence. The degree of sequence variance flanking the TRS showed no clear relationship with the abundance of the sg mRNAs (22 ) . A highly conserved s2m motif with 32 nucleotides was also identified in the 3 region of the genome, which had also been described in avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV; ref. 12 -14 ) .",

The translation of segment 1b of such polyprotein is interrupted by the \u22121 ribosomal frame shifting by a putative \"slippery\" sequence and a putative pseudoknot structure (16 ) . Two functional domains-papain-like cysteine proteinase (PL2 PRO ) and 3C-like cysteine proteinase (3CL PRO ), were identified experimentally and were responsible for the proteolytic processing of the polyprotein into 16 subunits (16 , 22 , 23 ) . A 375-a.a. SARS-CoV unique domain was identified upstream of the PL2 PRO domain, which is unparalleled in any other known coronaviruses (16 ) . In addition, seven more putative regions encoding RNA processing enzymes were identified, namely, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), RNA helicase (HEL) poly (U)specific endoribonuclease (XendoU), 30-to-50 exonuclease (ExoN), S-adenosylmethionine-dependent ribose 20-O-methyltransferase (20-O-MT), adenosine diphosphate-ribose 100-phosphatase (ADRP), and a cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD; ref. 16 ). The translation of two polyproteins from ORF 1a and 1b starts the genome expression. The two proteinases, PCL2 PRO and 3CL PRO , are then coupled with the proteolytic processing of the two polyproteins into 16 units. PCL2 PRO is responsible for the N-proximal cleavage and 3CL PRO is responsible for the C-proximal cleavage. The helicase is then released. ATPase activity and DNA duplex-unwinding activity were demonstrated by purified helicase, indicating that the protein has RNA polymerase activity (16 , 24 ) .",

Initial analysis of the 1255-a.a. peplomer protein of the virus reveals the possible existence of a signal peptide that would likely be cleaved between residues 13 and 14 (12 ) . The whole structure is predicted to contain a receptor-binding unit (S1) in the N-terminus (14 , 25 -27 ) and a transmembrane unit (S2) in the C-terminus (13 , 14 , 25 , 27 ) . Molecular modeling of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike glycoprotein (26 , 28 ) suggested that the former unit is consisted of mainly anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets with dispersed \u03b1 and \u03b2 regions, in addition to the three domains identified in the S2 unit. The confidence level of the predicted molecular models was strengthened by the good correlation between predicted accessibility and hydropathy profiles and by the correct locations of the N/O-glycosylation sites and most of the disulfide bridges. Whether the experimentally determined N-glycosylated sites from purified spike protein treated by tryptic digest together with PNGase followed by time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (29 ) are correctly located in the proposed model remains to be clarified. In the aspect of biological activities, receptors for the binding of the SARS-CoV remain mysterious, as comparative genomics did not point out any significant similarity with the S1 domain of other human coronaviruses, implying that these viruses are using different receptors for cell entry (12 ) . Subsequently, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was demonstrated to be a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV in vitro. Synctia was observed in cell culture expressing ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S1 domain, which could be inhibited by anti-ACE2 antibody (30 ) . Fine mapping on the N-terminal unit of the spike protein indicates that the receptor-binding domain is probably located between the residues 303 and 537 (31 ) .",

The conclusions drawn by the different research groups were similar, with the observation that SARS-CoV itself forms a distinct cluster-the fourth group of Coronaviridae, a notion supported by the high bootstrap values (above 90%). As a result, it has been concluded that the SARS-CoV is phylogenetically equidistant from all other known coronaviruses. Moreover, no detectable recombination event was concluded in the similarity plot on the whole genome alignment with other coronaviruses (14 ) . The above findings suggest that the SARS-CoV is neither a mutant nor a recombinant of existing coronaviruses, and that the possibility of such a virus emerging as a product of genetic engineering can be excluded, as it is unlikely to generate an infectious coronavirus with 50% of its genome different from the existing coronaviruses (9 ) .",

These authors criticized the phylogram construction based on different SARS-CoV proteins as unconvincing, and suggested the possibility that the SARS-CoV can be clustered into an existing group. As the structural and other accessory genes can either be gained or lost throughout the evolutionary process and in view of their low level of conservation, the author decided to target the replicase gene to perform the phylogenetic analysis. For this reason, the phylogenetic relationship was reconstructed through a rooted tree. The construction of the phylogram was done with the fused replicase gene with manual adjustment and exclusion of poorly conserved region. The resulting tree reveals that the gene was mostly related to group 2 coronaviruses and was assigned as a subgroup 2b. The author further pointed out that the SARS-CoV contains homologues of domains that are unique for group 2 coronaviruses, in the region of nsp1 and nsp3 (PL2 PRO ), in addition to the differences in the sequence and arrangements of the 3 -located ORFs, and the lack of antigenic cross-reactivity do not contradict their conclusion, as such a phenomenon was also observed in group 1 coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Based on the antigenic cross reactivity and genome characteristics, existing coronaviruses are generally classified into three subgroups (40 ) . All coronaviruses share a very similar organization in their functional and structural genes, but the arrangement of the so-called non-essential genes is remarkably different among the subgroups. Group 1 coronaviruses are mainly characterized by the presence of ORFs following the N gene. Group 2 coronaviruses have two additional ORFs, non-structural protein 2 (ns2) and HE gene, located between ORF 1b and the S gene. Only group 3 species have ORFs located between the M and N gene, and a conserved stem-loop motif s2m at their 3 UTR (Figure 1 ). Accessory ORFs are found between the S and E genes in all of the subgroups. However, these accessory ORFs within the S-E intergenic region do not seem to be homologous between the subgroups, though they are conserved within subgroups. The rate of evolution of these accessory genes is obviously higher than that of the essential genes, which provides an alternative to access the phylogeny of the coronavirus family. The names of the group-specific accessory ORFs were unified and denoted on the top of the corresponding subgroup ORFs. The X (black cross) represents the absence of ORFs within the region. Genome organization and accessory ORFs of these CoVs were confirmed except for the n2s of PHEV. All the accessory genes are group-specific and highly diverged within subgroups, particular within the S\u2212E intergenic region. SARS-CoV has a very similar genome structure with group 3 CoVs, with two ORFs located between M and N gene, and a conserved stem-loop motif s2m at their 3 UTR. Although the ORF 5a/5b of group 3 CoVs and ORF 5/6 of SARS-CoV are in homologous location, they do not have any significant sequence homology. Based on the confirmed ORFs of the SARS-CoV described above, a comparison of all homologous accessory and essential ORFs of known coronaviruses with the novel SARS-CoV is shown in Figure 1 . From the results, it does not seem that the coding regions are a consequence of a newly occurring recombination event between any of the existing known coronaviruses, similar to the conclusion made by Holmes (9 ) . Interestingly, the SARS-CoV genome has a very similar organization to that of group 3 avian coronaviruses (IBV and TCV), with the presence of three ORFs within the M-N intergenic region, two ORFs spanning between the S and E genes (65 ) , and a stem-loop motif s2m in 3 UTR. The presence of s2m and the finding that the 3 fragment of SARS-CoV RDRP clustered into group 3 in the phylogenetic analysis (39 ) suggest that the avian coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV might share a common ancestor which gained the s2m from a single RNA horizontal transfer event from a non-related virus family, as the astroviruses did (39 , 66 ) . Another possibility, that a common coronavirus ancestor had once gained the motif but subsequently lost it, except the group 3 and SARS-CoV, cannot of course be excluded. Pairwise sequence homology search among the accessory ORFs at the S-E intergenic region of the SARS-CoV and all other coronaviruses shows no significant sequence homology (12 -14 ) but they are homologous within subgroups. The ORF 5a/5b of group 3 coronaviruses and ORFs 6-8 of the SARS-CoV are in a homologous location, but they do not have any significant sequence homology. The above results imply that, although the SARS-CoV and group 3 coronaviruses have a very similar genome organization, they might have acquired these accessory genes from several RNA recombination events with different hosts or viral sources. It is observed that the accessory ORFs are group-specific but are usually truncated to a different extent within a subgroup (Figure 1 ). Another interesting observation is the genetic diversity at the S-E intergenic region. Usually two or three group-specific ORFs are found within this region of each subgroup, but only one confirmed ORF (ORF 3) is found in this region of the SARS-CoV genome (12 -14 , 16 , 22 ) . The diversity (mainly due to truncation and deletion) of these S-E intergenic ORFs within the subgroups is higher than that of other accessory ORFs. Their sequence divergence implies their common ancestors might have acquired these ORFs by RNA recombination, which is a common phenomenon in large RNA viruses (67 , 68 ) , rather than evolved from mutations of a single ancestral RNA sequence segment (9 ) . Typical examples are the acquirement of the HE gene from Influenza C (69 ) and recombination events with Berne virus at the HE-ns2 region (52 ) .",

Together with the evidence implied by the phylogenetic studies, it is tempting to identify the possible animal reservoir of the coronavirus. Recent studies of domestic and wild animals in Guangdong, where the SARS epidemic was first reported, identified the existence of the SARS-CoV from several animals found in the livestock market, including Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides; ref. 80 ), in spite of the failure of another group to identify any SARS-CoV after the screening of more than 60 animal species (81 ) . The genome sequences of the coronaviruses isolated from these animals are almost identical (99.8%) to that of the SARS-CoV, revealing the extremely close phylogenetic relationship between them. Another major finding from the sequence analysis highlighted a 29-bp deletion upstream the N gene, which was noted only in one Guangdong isolate available from the Gen-Bank (GD01, accession number 278489). Such deletion leads to the fusion of the two ORFs identified in mRNA 8 into one ORF. Yet its biological significance remains to be elucidated (8 ) . Comparison of the S gene nucleotide sequence of the animal and human SARS-CoV indicated 11 consistent nucleotide signature mutations that appeared to distinguish them.",

Using PCR amplification plus sequencespecific oligonucleotide probing (PCR-SSOP), researchers identified the HLA genotype of SARS patients. Healthy, unrelated Taiwanese were used as controls, and the HLA genotype of SARS patients was compared with probable cases and with high-risk, uninfected health care workers. The results indicated that a higher frequency of HLA-B*4601 allele was found in severe SARS cases, which may explain the severity of SARS in these patients. Such genotype, as stated in the report, is common in Southern Han Chinese, Singaporeans and Vietnamese, but not in indigenous Taiwanese. There was no reported SARS case within the latter ethnic group. Such findings may explain the unusual SARS epidemic in South Asia.",

The S gene has been used as a target for genotyping most coronaviruses, like human coronaviruses (96 ) and IBV (97 ) . Study of the N-terminal region of the SARS-CoV spike protein produced similar conclusions by conventional epidemiology methods (98 ) . The investigation included the collection S1 gene sequences from SARS patients in Hong Kong and Guangdong during February-April 2003 mainly by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products derived from clinical specimens, and compared it phylogenetically to additional 27 other sequences available from GenBank. The majority of the Hong Kong viruses, including those from a large outbreak in a high-rise apartment block, Amoy Garden, clustered to a single index case that came from Guangdong to Hong Kong in late February ( Figure 3 ). Most of the viruses derived from Hong Kong patients belong to the same lineage with viruses derived from the Hong Kong index case. Outbreaks in Canada, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam were also derived from the SARS-CoV of the same initial virus lineage as judged from the same phylogenetic analysis. A number of viruses derived from the early patients were excluded from the major lineage and formed distinct cluster, implying multiple introductions of the virus have occurred, although these viruses did not caused large-scale outbreaks. Viral sequences identified in Guangdong and Beijing are genetically more diverse (1 , 98 ) , implying that the SARS-CoV has been circulating there for a while before the introduction to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong index case that initiated the first super-spreading incident to affect 12 other patients might be simply a matter of chance or the viruses found in that patient were contagious to initiate super-spreading events, but these still need further investigations. Apart from findings that indicate the possible transmission routes, transitional isolates that possess both the characteristics of two lineages were also identified. Ruan et al (99 ) and Tsui et al (100 ) performed similar analysis based on the comparison of full genome sequences of different SARS-CoV isolates. They independently identified some of the variations, as Guan et al (98 ) did. Chiu et al (101 ) have recently identified the nucleotide substitution in the S gene that is unique to the Taiwan isolates and was linked to the Hong Kong index case. Sequence comparison of the Amoy Garden isolates revealed no significant variations within the S1 gene, or across the whole genome, implying that other non-viral factors may contribute to the abnormal transmission and clinical presentation of SARS in this cluster of high-rise apartments (98 , 102 ) . In summary, the transmission route of the SARS-CoV in different countries and areas correlates well with the traditional epidemiological findings, implying the successful application of molecular epidemiological techniques in tracing the virus transmission history.",

IgG antibody could be detected at the 7th day after the onset of symptoms and kept at high titer at least three months (107 ) . Another report indicated that the virus was still detectable in respiratory and stool specimens by RT-PCR diagnosis but could not be cultured more than 40 days after presentation (108 ) , implying that the antibody could be stimulated rapidly and might restrict the virus infection. However it has also been reported in fowl and feline coronaviral diseases that low-level antibody may exacerbate diseases (109 ) . It is therefore important to conduct further investigations into the immune response to SARS patients in the future so as to benefit the vaccine development and disease control.",

All sample names were hidden for the convenience of display, except the index case isolate HKU-33 (gray) and subcluster transition isolates (dark). The locations of these isolates on the tree were pinpointed by dots besides their names. The hypothetical common ancestors of the subclusters were highlighted as described in the right bottom of the figure. tein in SARS is thus desirable. With the identification of the SARS-CoV functional receptor (30 ) and the mapping of the receptor-binding domain on the spike protein (31 ) , subunit vaccine targeting the receptorbinding domain and the preparation of killed or attenuated vaccine using ACE2 expression cell line may be promising (30 ) . Antiviral drugs represent an alternative anti-SARS strategy to vaccination. Inhibiting chemicals targeting the SARS-CoV replication-related proteins were considered as anti-SARS-CoV drug candidates, e.g. inhibition the enzymatic activity of 3CL PRO . An extensive structural analysis of 3CL PRO encoded from nsp5 on ORF 1a was performed (28 , 111 ) . The 3CL PRO structure showed a considerable degree of conservation of the substrate-binding sites, with the evidence that it could retain its proteolytic activity upon TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) main proteinase (111 ) , though another group mentioned that the inactive property of the enzyme might exist in vitro (112 ) . From this result, these authors suggested that the use of rhinovirus 3C PRO inhibitor might be useful in anti-SARS therapy. Two months later, a research group from the US conducted a study on the interaction of two chemicals (KZ7088 and the AVLQSGFR octapeptide) with 3CL PRO (113 ), further highlighting the importance of the main proteinase as a target for anti-viral drug design. Fan et al (114 ) provided valuable additional information, and concluded that only the dimeric form of the 3CL PRO is active and that the proteinase-substrate interaction can be speeded up if more beta-sheet-like structure is involved in the substrate. Recently the crystal structure of 3CL PRO was reported by Yang et al (115 ) . The 3CL PRO crystal underwent conformational changes under different pH conditions while complexing with the specific inhibitor at the same time. A serine-protease fold with a Cys-His at the active site was recognized. On the other hand, the modeling of the structure of 20-O-MT domain located at nsp16 was proposed by von Grotthuss et al (116 ) using the 3D jury system with high reliability (3D jury score >100). The conservation of the unique tetrad residues K-D-K-E of the domain assigned a proposed mRNA cap methylation function of this domain, suggesting an alternative target for anti-viral drug design. In addition to main proteases, blocking the virus entry should be considered as well. Structural analysis of the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein, which plays a role in fusion of the virus with host cell, revealed a conservation of sequence motifs with the wellstudied gp41 protein of HIV-1 and other viruses with class I transmembrane domain (27 ) . Such a structure may be another target for drug design.",

The development of a rapid and accurate method of diagnosis based on the molecular findings has helped to identify SARS patients at an early stage of the disease, thereby providing valuable information for national authorities to monitor the spread of the disease and take effective quarantine measures, and contributing to the understanding of the clinical presentations of the syndrome. The elucidation of the molecular biology of the SARS-CoV has provided a foundation for vaccine design and narrowed down the targets for large-scale high throughput drug screening program for anti-viral therapy. These advances helped the global community to contain the spread of SARS within four months since its first identification. However, much remains to be discovered about this novel coronavirus, and it may yet pose a serious threat. Unlike other recently identified viral diseases like Ebola and West Nile virus, it seems the transmission of SARS-CoV does not need a visible vector for spreading, and that a tiny, invisible, respiratory droplet is sufficient to infect another person (117 ) . The nearly undetectable symptom presented by the recently confirmed SARS case in Singapore suggests that the virus may continue to circulate undetectably (65 ) . The possibility that common domestic animals are also a virus reservoir for SARS further complicates the struggle to contain and ultimately eradicate this disease. In these aspects, sensitive, accurate and rapid diagnosis plays an extremely important role in limiting the disease spread, especially in the developing world and densely populated countries. Luckily, the aggressive quarantine measures imposed by the WHO proved to be effective in containing the outbreak, and the experience gained in the last SARS outbreak has prepared us to face another outbreak with some confidence. Nevertheless, nobody can predict exactly when an effective vaccine or anti-viral drug will be developed. All that can be said is that, based on our growing knowledge of the molecular epidemiology and evolution of the virus, the successful development of countermeasures to SARS is very possible.",
