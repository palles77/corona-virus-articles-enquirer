            "text": "ily [2] . Ebola virus has a negative sense RNA genome that encodes 7 different proteins and is surrounded by an envelope that contains the virally expressed glycoprotein (GP). There are five species of Ebola virus including, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus and Reston ebolavirus, all of which were named after the places where they were first discovered [3] . Ebola virus GP is associated with viral attachment to the host cell receptor prior to viral entry into the cells [4, 5] . To date, neutralizing antibodies targeting Ebola virus GP have been reported to be somewhat effective at reducing the severity of Ebola virus infection and disease progression in animal models and humans. For example, when Ebola virus-infected monkeys were treated within 24 hours following Ebola virus challenge with ZMAb (composed of three monoclonal antibodies [MAbs] against Ebola virus GP), all survived from Ebola virus infection, while all monkeys without ZMAb treatment died within five days of viral infection [6, 7] Furthermore, ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical) treatment is known to be effective at reducing mortality rates in patients infected with Ebola virus [8] . Despite the severity of Ebola virus infection, there are currently neither preventive vaccines nor therapeutic drugs readily available for use. Thus, development of vaccines or more effective drugs against Ebola viral infection is highly demanding.",

            "text": "MAbs have been broadly utilized as medicine, as well as diagnostic tools for virus infections. MAbs are generated by hybridoma technology where mice are injected with an immunogenic antigen and then the splenocytes are utilized to fuse with myeloma cells [9] . In this regard, antigens of high purity and with native protein folding are a pre-requisite for generating neutralizing antibodies that can target a native form of viral surface proteins. DNA vaccines are thought to be useful at generating the native from of viral antigens as they tend to express their proteins in cells in a manner similar to real viral infection. However, DNA vaccines are less effective at producing IgG-secreting hybridomas, possibly due to the presence of un-methylated CpG sequences in the DNA vaccines that stimulate polyclonal B cell activation [10] . In the Lee et al. (2017) study [10] , use of protein boosting immunization was effective at reversing the preference for production of IgM-secreting hybridomas over IgG-secreting hybridomas. Moreover, multiple immunizations with GP after GP DNA vaccination might be useful at increasing the chance of generating antibodies with higher antigen binding affinity. In this context, it is highly likely that an appropriate application of GP DNA and protein vaccines may generate hybridoma clones that secrete IgG with higher binding affinity to the native form of the antigen.",

The antibodies showed binding activity to the native forms of GP expressed on the cell surface or the mucin-like region of GP, but not the denatured form of GP. They also reacted specifically with GP, and remained reactive to GP at the lowest tested concentrations ranging from 1.953 to 7.8 ng/mL. However, none of the antibodies neutralized Ebola virus infection in vitro, suggesting that these IgG antibodies are unable to block Ebola virus infection. Thus, these IgG antibodies possess GP-binding activity but not Ebola virus-neutralizing activity.",

            "text": "We previously reported that DNA priming and protein boosting can preferentially generate hybridomas secreting IgG antibodies [10] . To generate IgG antibodies with higher antigenbinding activity, the immunization scheme was modified: mice were injected by IM-EP with pcDNA3-GP (50 \u00b5g/mouse) at 0, 4, and 12 weeks, followed by intraperitoneal injection at 20 weeks with recombinant GP (20 \u00b5g/mouse) emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Four weeks later, the mice were intravenously injected with recombinant GP (20 \u00b5g/mouse) in PBS. The mice were sacrificed 3 days after the final injection and the splenocytes were used for fusion. In this fusion experiment, 12 hybridomas, the cell supernatants of which displayed 10 times higher OD values than those of the negative control by ELISA and displayed both heavy and light chains of IgG by Western blot assay, were selected (data not included). These 12 hybridomas were designated C36, D11, D12, D34, E2, E8, E12, E22, E31, E49, E60, and E140. For MAb production, the 12 selected hybridomas were diluted to make a single cell clone using the limiting dilution sub-culture method [11] . As a result, 7 monoclonal clones were obtained and designated C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, E12-10, E49-3, and E140-2 (Table 1) . Unfortunately, we were unable to generate any clones secreting GP-specific IgG antibodies for clones E2, E8, E22, E31 and E60. In addition, we obtained only IgM-secreting single clones (e.g., E12-10 and E49-3) from hybridomas (E12 and E49). Finally, IgG antibodies were purified from the cell supernatants of 5 clones (C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, and E140-2) using the protein G column. They all resolved into 2 protein bands (50-kDa H chains and 25-kDa L chains) on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel ( Fig. 2A) . They also reacted with Ebola virus GP, but not with MERS coronavirus-spike protein and SFTS virus GP, as determined by ELISA (Fig. 2B) . This result suggests that these purified IgG antibodies are indeed antigen-specific. Furthermore, IgG antibodies from clones C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, and E140-2 remained reactive to GP at the lowest tested concentrations of 1.953, 7.8, 7.8, 1.953, and 1.953 ng/mL, respectively (Fig. 2C) . In this case, the lowest tested concentrations are defined as the lowest IgG concentrations showing positive optical density values compared to those of control IgG (2 \u00b5g/mL) when IgG samples were serially diluted by 2-fold from the dose (2 \u00b5g/mL) and then reacted with recombinant GP in ELISA. When the IgG antibodies from the five clones were further tested for their reactivity to five different GP1 proteins (GP1a, GP1b, GP1c, GP1d, and GP1e), only the IgG antibodies from clone D12-1 reacted with GP1e while the IgG antibodies from clones C36-1, D11-3, D34-2, and E140-2 failed to react with any of the GP1 proteins (Fig. 2D) . This result suggests that the IgG antibodies from clones C36-1, D11-3, D34-2, and E140-2 may recognize either the tertiary structure of GP or the GP regions excluding the receptor-binding domain and mucin-like region, and that the IgG antibodies from clone D12-1 might recognize the mucin-like region of GP. This is illustrated in Table 1 . ",

            "text": "In this study, we observed that vaccination with DNA vaccines encoding cell membrane-targeting viral antigens led to induction of IgG antibodies recognizing the native forms of the antigens expressed on the cell surface. For instance, immune sera, displaying reactivity to GP expressed on the cell surface, were demonstrated by flow cytometry using both FITC-conjugated IgG (Fc) and FITC-conjugated IgG (whole molecule). In this case, FITC-conjugated IgG (Fc) recognized only IgG types, as opposed to FITC-conjugated IgG (whole molecule) (data not included). Moreover, DNA vaccines coding for cell membrane-associated antigens were reported to be more effective at inducing Ag-specific immune responses, as compared to those coding for intracellular antigens [12] . These data including ours suggest that DNA vaccines encoding any viral surface membrane proteins can induce IgG responses to the native and outer-membrane forms of the viral proteins. Thus, it is possible that these IgG antibodies may be utilized to target viral surface antigens as either diagnostic or neutralizing antibodies. Previously, we reported that DNA vaccina-tion alone resulted in the preferential production of IgM-secreting hybridomas over IgG-secreting hybridomas [10] . In that study, use of recombinant proteins in the DNA vaccination platform reversed this propensity, highlighting the notion that proteins may be a useful vaccine type for increased production of IgG-specific hybridomas in DNA vaccination.",

            "text": "In the current study, we successfully generated IgG-secreting hybridomas by boosting the GP DNA vaccine-primed mice with GP emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and finally with GP dissolved in PBS. This result corroborates the notion that proteins, as a booster vaccine type, may play a critical role in boosting the production of IgG-secreting hybridomas in the DNA vaccine platform. In the screening scheme using ELISA and Western blot assay, we were able to obtain a total of 12 polyclonal hybridomas secreting GP-specific IgG types. Among these, we obtained five clones (producing an IgG isotype) and two clones (producing an IgM isotype) by the limiting dilution sub-culture method. The purified monoclonal IgG antibodies from five clones (C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, and E140-2) reacted with Ebola virus GP, but not MERS coronavirus Spike protein and SFTS virus-GP, suggesting that they are indeed antigenspecific. Moreover, they were IgG kappa types and remained reactive to Ebola virus GP at the lowest concentrations ranging from 1.593 to 7.8 ng/mL. In particular, the IgG antibodies from 3 clones (D11-3, D12-1 and E140-2) recognized GP expressed on the cell surface of HEK293-GP, suggesting that they may recognize the native and outer-membrane forms of GP. On the other hand, the IgG antibodies from one clone (D12-1) recognized GP1e (containing mucin-like region) alone, suggesting that this IgG antibody recognizes the mucin-like region of GP. However, the IgG antibodies from four clones (C36-1, D11-3, D34-2, and E140-2) recognized none of the http://www.ecevr.org/ https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2018.7.2.119 five recombinant GP1s, suggesting that the four purified IgG antibodies may recognize the tertiary forms of GP and/or other GP sites excluding the mucin-like region and receptorbinding domain of GP. Moreover, none of the five purified IgG antibodies recognized the denatured forms of GP. These data are in line with our observation that sera from animals immunized with GP DNA vaccines were unable to recognize the denatured forms of GP by Western blot assay (data not included). Taken together, these data show that the five purified IgG antibodies can recognize only a native from of GP. Here, it is notable that the remaining five polyclonal hybridomas (E2, E8, E22, E31, and E60) appear to lose their ability to produce IgG antibodies after continuous cell culture and passage, leading to a failure in making an IgG producer. Among numerous single clones obtained after limiting dilution subculture from the polyclonal hybridomas, not a single clone was observed to secrete Ag-specific IgG antibodies (data not included). In this context, it is highly likely that the loss of IgG productivity might be ascribed to a decrease in the fraction of IgG-producing hybridoma cells over time, possibly resulting from the loss of the chromosomes containing the gene loci for the IgG heavy and light chains. This is supported by the previous finding of others [13] . On the other hand, clones E12-10 and E49-3, displaying the highest OD values among numerous clones, were secreted as an IgM producer. Prior to limiting dilution sub-culture, two hybridomas (E12 and E49) generated IgG types, but later lost their ability to generate IgG antibodies. It is likely that in the case of 2 hybridomas (E12 and E49), IgG-producing cell populations may have disappeared and then been replaced by IgM-producing cell populations. This notion is supported by our observation that the cell supernatants from two hybridomas (E12 and E49) exhibited high binding activity to all five different recombinant GP1s (suggestive of antigen-non-specific binding) in an ELI-SA (data not shown). In addition, these cell supernatants also reacted with GP in an ELISA using HRP-conjugated IgM as well (data not shown), confirming that clones E12-10 and E49-3 are indeed from polyclonal cells producing IgG and IgM antibodies. It has been reported that Ebola virus GP is responsible for binding to the host cell's receptor for viral entry [4, 5] . Ebola virus GP-specific antibodies including 2G4 monoclonal IgG antibodies are known to block viral infection to the host cells [6] . In this study, we observed that the five purified IgG antibodies were unable to block Ebola virus infection to the host cell in vitro. These data suggest that the five purified GP-specific IgG antibodies including three (rec-ognizing a native GP expressed on the cell surface) do not have any neutralizing activity toward Ebola virus infection.",

(A) The hybridomas (D36, D11, D12, D34, and E140) were diluted to make a single cell by the limiting dilution sub-clone method. The resulting monoclonal hybridoma clones were designated C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, and E140-2. IgG antibodies were purified from the cell supernatants using the protein G column. Two \u00b5g of the purified IgG antibodies were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE for brilliant blue R staining.(B) The purified IgG (2 \u00b5g/mL) were reacted with Ebola virus GP, MERS coronavirus spike protein and SFTS virus GP for ELISA. (C) Evaluation of the lowest GP-binding concentration of IgG antibodies. Two micrograms per milliliter of IgG antibodies from the clones, C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, and E140-2 were serially diluted by 2-fold and then reacted with GP in parallel with control IgG (2 \u00b5g/mL) to determine the lowest GP-binding concentration using ELISA. (D) Five recombinant GP1 proteins (1 \u00b5g/mL) were coated and reacted with the five purified IgG antibodies (0.2 \u00b5g/mL) from clones, C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, and E140-2 for ELISA.
