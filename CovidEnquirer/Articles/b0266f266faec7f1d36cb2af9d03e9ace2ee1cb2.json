The objective of this study was to explore the adherence of nurses to SPs and to identify factors influencing adherence to SPs. Methods: This study was an exploratory cross-sectional survey. A total of 339 nurses from 9 general hospitals and 3 tertiary hospitals located in 3 South Korean cities were selected. Hierarchical regression was used to examine the effects of sociodemographic, individual, and institutional factors. Results: A higher, or positive, attitude was the strongest influencing factor in adherence to SPs in the final model, followed by administrative support, hospital types, and safety climate, in descending order. These 4 variables accounted for 26.0% of the variance in adherence to SPs. Conclusions: The attitudes of nurses toward SPs is important for increasing the adherence to SP best practices. The adherence of nurses to SPs will improve if safe environments are created in different hospital types and if managerial support and administrative efforts are supportive and sustained.",

            "text": "Health care workers are at risk of exposure to blood and body fluids containing bloodborne pathogens. Nurses are especially prone to exposure, owing to their involvement in direct, invasive, and continuous nursing activities. 1, 2 Standard precautions (SPs) serve as the first line of defense against exposure to bodily fluids such as blood and secretions, mucous membranes, and nonintact skin, which were deemed infectious, regardless of a patient's diagnosis. 3 In 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added respiratory hygiene and/or cough etiquette and safe injection practices to the list of SPs. 3 Adherence to SPs is essential in preventing health care\u2212associated infection (HAI). 4, 5, 6 The 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea was the second largest health care\u2212associated outbreak in the world. Failure to adhere to basic SPs and protocols, pursuant to different routes of disease transmission, contributed to the outbreak. 7 This has assisted with an increased awareness of HAIs and efforts with improving the levels of adherence to SP. However, the level of adherence among nurses remains insufficient, requiring a behavioral change to improve adherence and prevent HAIs. 4, 5, 6, 8 Studies on the influencing factors of SP adherence have been investigated, including individual, work-related, and organizational factors 9 or sociodemographic, individual, and institutional factors. 10 Occasionally, factors such as knowledge, attitude, safety climate, protective device, and workload have been examined without distinction of categories. 11 Haile et al 10 reported that the sociodemographic factors reported to affect adherence to SP include being female, 11 length of work experience, 12 age, 13 higher level of education, 6, 13 and department the nurse is stationed in. 6 Health belief, awareness, and risk perception have been identified as influencers of adherence to SP among individuals, 4, 5, 10, 12 with results varying by country, hospital type, and subject. Recently, institutional factors such as safety equipment availability and accessibility, management support for safe work practice, safety performance feedback, and workplace safety climate have received attention for their importance in SP adherence. 10 A study of registered nurses from 25 public hospitals in China were affected by protective equipment, safety climate, and workload, 11 whereas other studies show that workplace safety climate influences SP adherence among nurses in dialysis care 12 and adherence to SP by nurses in psychiatric wards is correlated with organizational factors, including availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the security climate. 9 Haile et al 10 also show that medical staff in university hospitals were found to be affected by training on SP, accessibility of PPE, and management support. This suggests it is necessary to investigate institutional factors affecting workplace safety climates, including physical, and other circumstances, together with administrative support. 10, 13 This study aimed to understand how sociodemographic and individual factors, such as knowledge and attitude, along with institutional factors such as safety climate and administrative support, influence the adherence of nurses to SPs in South Korean hospitals following the 2015 MERS outbreak. 7, 8 Evaluating the effects of sociodemographic, individual, and institutional factors, whereas considering the hospital size and type, will contribute to the improvement of SP adherence and to the creation of a safe environment and administrative system.",

            "text": "Adherence to SP is affected by various factors, and changes in institutional factors, in addition to changes in sociodemographic and individual factors, must be explored to bring about a behavioral shift. 10 Among individual changes required to increase adherence to SP best practices, knowledge, attitude, awareness, risk perception, and health beliefs have been studied. 4, 6, 9, 15, 16 In some studies, knowledge and attitude were found to be major influencers and have positive effects on adherence to SP best practices. 4, 11, 17 However, in other studies, they did not exert a significant effect, or only 1 exerted meaningful influence. 9 In this study, the biggest influencer on adherence to SP was attitude. Whereas SP adherence was not correlated with knowledge, knowledge had a correlation with attitude. A positive attitude was highly correlated to knowledge about infection control prevention around body fluids, including blood, which led to an overall improved adherence to SP. This shift in attitude indicates that it is possible to shift behavior. The higher degree of perception should take place across sub-items under attitude, including hand hygiene, PPE, environmental management (cleaning, disinfecting, and laundry), needlestick and sharps injury prevention, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette. 3 Given that SP should be applied to all patients before identifying the source of infection, an effective training system should be established to promote adherence to SP at all times as well as promotional and managerial programs addressing each sub-item under SP. This study sets itself apart from others in that it considers hospital type as a significant factor influencing adherence level. South Korean tertiary hospitals serve as both educational institutions and advanced general hospitals. Tertiary hospitals with 800-1,300 beds are likely to have more infection control personnel and an infection control fee commensurate with their bed count. 19 The infection control fee is paid to a hospital as compensation if the hospital meets staffing requirements: 1 infection control doctor and 1 or more infection control nurses for every 150-200 beds. 19 Additionally, tertiary hospitals are also required to have a strict infection control system based on hospital accreditation evaluation. 8, 19 A similar study on nurses in hemodialysis care showed that adherence to SP was significantly lower among nurses in private hospitals than those in general or tertiary hospitals, which is a reflection of poor infection control system in private hospitals owing to blind spots created by medical laws. 12 In spite of the heightened national and social awareness of HAI and the amendment of the Medical Services Act following the MERS outbreak in 2015, further efforts should be made to improve adherence to SP and to strengthen infection control in small to medium-sized general hospitals. 12 The safety climate score was 76.5 (out of 100 points), which was higher than 71.4 in a 2010 study of nurses working in South Korean general hospitals. 17 This increase is likely owing to the legal and administrative efforts following the outbreak of a new infectious disease. 7 However, the fact that \"There is not enough time to perform tasks, whereas adhering to SPs (reversed item)\" scored the lowest, with 36.7 \u00a7 48.3 points, shows that hospitals must not only supply sanitizers and PPE, but also work toward adequate arrangement of personnel and nursing so nurses can both finish tasks and adhere to SP. The high standard deviation in this item was considered to be owing to variance in the various subjective perceptions of time as well as in 12 different hospitals and departments with various scale of bed counts. A previous study reported that Chinese hospitals are also faced with frequent occupational exposure owing to a shortage of nurses and an increased workload, which detrimentally affect the adherence to SP, 11 highlighting the importance of sufficient nursing personnel.",

Whereas items for administrative support vary across different studies, Brazilian studies found that nurses with management support were more likely to comply with SP than those who had less frequent support 20 and that training on SP guidelines enhances adherence level, encourages learning of recently updated protocols, and serves as a major contributor to continued adherence. 21 An additional Ethiopian study showed that managerial support for safety and staff training increased adherence to SP 2.23-and 2.90-fold, respectively. 10 Organizational infrastructure for infection control cannot be created without commitment and support from the management, hindering efficient adherence to SP. Given that \"Manager gives praises when I perform tasks according to SPs\" was the item with the lowest score, not only surveillance but a reward system should be considered as well. Managers should set up a training system to correct nurses' nonadherence, act as role models in adherence to SP, and stand at the forefront of SP amendment and policy making. Administrative support would improve adherence of nurses to SP and enable efficient management.",

Therefore, we suggest a follow-up study using observation to ensure objectivity in regard to adherence to SP. In addition, since general and tertiary hospitals were selected using convenience sampling, a selection of hospitals via systematic allocation considering the area and facility size would be necessary. Furthermore, male nurses only accounted for 3.9% of the sample, which is insufficient given that the average ratio of male nurses in South Korea is 10%. Last, this study focused on South Korea, whose circumstances are rather particular with respect to the national outbreak of MERS in 2015; and therefore, its results should be interpreted with caution.",

In a hierarchical analysis, the sociodemographic (model 1), individual (model 2), and institutional (model 3) factors, with significant influence on adherence to SP, were found to be hospital type, attitude, and safety climate and administrative support, respectively. Attitude was the biggest influencer of adherence to SP, followed by administrative support, hospital types, and safety climate. Adherence to SP by nurses will improve if safe environments are created in different hospital types, and if managerial support and administrative efforts are sustained. To change the attitude of nurses toward SP, consistent promotion and a reward system should be put into place, along with practical training applicable to clinical practice. Special care should be put into small and medium-sized hospitals, which are more likely to be overlooked when it comes to infection control, and institutional efforts should be made to secure adequate staff, physical safety environment, and nursing time required for creating safety climate. Hospital administrators should take responsibility as role models and demonstrate consistent adherence to SP with determination and commitment. ",
