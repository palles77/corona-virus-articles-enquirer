Their serum-bilirubin data were skewed but women with a bilirubin z 7 mg/dl (12.0 p.1110J/l) and men with a bilirubin > 1.4 mg/dl (24.0 p.11101/l) were claimed to constitute a second, minor population who, Owens and Evans suggested, had Gilbert's syndrome; if so about 6% of the population would have this disorder. They found two distinct linear sections when their data were plotted on normal-probability as distinct from log-probability paper. Our data plotted on normal-probability paper yielded a smooth logarithmic curve with no evidence of bimodality. This difference could be due to sampling error in earlier study ; the upper end of Owens and Evans' distribution contains very few data points. In fact their data can be accommodated by a single log-normal distribution, thus weakening their case for bimodality.",

The minor haemolysis demonstrated in some patients with Gilbert's syndrome is not enough to account for the hyperbilirubinaemia.14 It is not surprising that the repeat bilirubins were slightly different from the first ones. In patients with a raised bilirubin the concentration does vary and the patients had not fasted before the second examination. Is Gilbert's syndrome a disease or merely an extreme expression of normality? A low uridine-diphosphate glucuronyl transferase,'s altered bilirubin kinetics,4 slightly reduced red-blood-cell survival,14 or even a genetic predisposition3 do not mean that it represents a disease state. One would expect to find differences in factors which control bilirubin concentration in a group of people with a high bilirubin if they are compared with those with a lower bilirubin. Were it feasible to measure them in a large normal population these factors could also be expected to have a skew distribution.",

            "text": "Introduction THE immunological basis for glomerulonephritis is well established and immunofluorescence studies have shown immunoglobulins in the glomeruli of patients with glomerulonephritis. Immunoglobulins are produced in response to an antigen, but the nature of the antigen is often obscure and its demonstration difficult. However, numerous bacterial antigens (especially streptococci) may cause glomerular damage through immunological mechanisms. Chronic viral infection of animals with lymphocytic choriomeningitis, the agent of aleutian dis-ease of mink 2 Coxsackie B4, adenovirus/ and other viruses6 can result in immune-complex nephritis. In man the role of viruses in the aetiology of glomerulonephritis has been studied chiefly in cases or renal disease developing after viral illnesses caused by echovirus 9,7 Coxsackie B,8 and varicella infections.9 Raised titres of anti-Epstein-Barr have been demonstrated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus glomerulonephritis, and parainfluenza type-3 antibody titres were raised in patients with immune-complex glomerulonephritis.10 Intravascular coagulation with renal involvement has been reported in patients with influenza-A virus infection\" 12 and in a case of Goodpasture's syndrome after influenza-A2 virus infection. 13 Urine fibrin-degradation products are an accurate marker of the activity of the glomerulonephritic process. 14 In the present study high concentrations of urine fibrin-degradation products and immunoglobulins suggested that an immunological process consistent with a subclinical attack of glomerulonephritis had occurred during an epidemic of an influenza-like disease.",
