Our major efforts have focused mainly on the following points: the establishment of a reliable system for nosocomial infection control, the organization of training courses, implementation of appropriate infection control measures in the event of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic,, and fact-fi nding surveys of nosocomial infection control. 6, 7 In the year 2003, i.e., immediately after the SARS epidemic, the fi rst fact-fi nding survey of nosocomial infection control in hospitals in the north of Vietnam was carried out, and it was noted that awareness of nosocomial infection control was increasing, but the levels of knowledge and the quality of the infection control systems, as well as the preparation of necessary equipment for effective nosocomial infection control, were still poor. 8 In 2007, a second fact-fi nding survey of nosocomial infection control in hospitals in the north of Vietnam was performed, and the results were compared with those obtained in 2003. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate progress in the nosocomial infection control situation and to prepare the basic information needed to provide further technical guidance. Furthermore, based on the results of the second survey (the present study), training programs were prepared and training courses were organized for the medical staff in local hospitals.",

It is also indispensable for implementing effective control measures for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the possible occurrence of a human infl uenza pandemic. The present authors, in collaboration with Vietnamese hospital staff, performed a fact-fi nding survey of nosocomial infection control in hospitals in northern Vietnam and compared the results with those of a survey conducted 4 years previously. Remarkable improvement was recognized in this period, although there were considerable differences between the central hospitals in Hanoi and local hospitals. In the local hospitals, basic techniques and the systems for infection control were regarded as insuffi cient, and it is necessary to improve these techniques and systems under the guidance of hospitals in the central area. Based on the results of the survey, programs were prepared and training courses were organized in local hospitals. Evaluation conducted after the training courses showed a high degree of satisfaction among the trainees. The results of the survey and the training courses conducted during the study period are expected to contribute to the improvement of nosocomial infection control in remote areas of Vietnam Key words Infection control \u00b7 Survey \u00b7 Nosocomial infection \u00b7 Vietnam",

Besides, basic techniques such as hand hygiene and disinfection methods, which are considered to be essential matters for implementing effective nosocomial infection control, were still showing insuffi ciency. The proportion of hospitals conducting surveillance of nosocomial infection had increased compared with the results of the 2003 survey, but numbers were still limited, particularly in local areas. These fi ndings suggest the necessity for more intensive measures to be taken to improve the quality of infection control. Also, in view of the recent increase in bacterial resistance to antibiotics, which is one of the leading causes of nosocomial infection, appropriate use of antibiotics, based on accurate bacteriological testing, along with appropriate guidelines, is required.",
