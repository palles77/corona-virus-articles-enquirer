In trial 1, phase 2, the same calves from phase 1 grouped by CON and TIL were moved to group pens (4 pens per treatment, 4 calves per pen) for the next 56 d. The starter was blended with 5% chopped grass hay and fed free choice. Trial 2 was similar to trial 1, phase 2 and used 48 two-month-old male Holstein calves. Calves were randomly selected to receive either a s.c. injection of Zuprevo (4 mg of tildipirosin/kg of BW; TIL) on d 0 or no injections (CON). In trial 1, phase 1, preweaning ADG and BCS change; postweaning starter intake and hip width change; overall starter intake, ADG, and hip width change; final hip width; and final BCS were greater for TIL than CON. During phase 2 of trial 1 and trial 2, calf ADG and hip width change were greater for TIL than CON. Overall, in transported Holstein calves, TIL improved ADG and structural growth by approximately 13%.",

Tulathromycin and TIL are reported to have good efficacy to reduce issues with respiratory pathogens in dairy calves less than 3 mo of age (Amrine et al., 2014; Confer et al., 2016; Bartram et al., 2016) . Amrine et al. (2014) and Bartram et al. (2016) reported that calf ADG after Mannheimia haemolytica or Mycoplasma bovis challenges were greater in calves treated with both TIL and TUL compared with non-antibiotic-treated calves. Although government agencies encourage less use of antibiotics in livestock (Weese et al., 2015) , proper metaphylactic use of antibiotics in livestock might lower the overall use of antibiotics and reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance (Weese, 2006) . Additionally, metaphylactic antibiotic treatments of dairy calves are implemented on many farms (USDA-APHIS, 1999) . Therefore, with the successful use of TUL and TIL to reduce respiratory sickness common in pre-and postweaned dairy calves and improved growth in calves treated with TUL in some studies, research was implemented to test the metaphylactic use of TIL in pre-and postweaned dairy calves.",
