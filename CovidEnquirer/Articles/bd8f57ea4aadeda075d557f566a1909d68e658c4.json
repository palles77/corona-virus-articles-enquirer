            "text": "The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) threatens global health, given serious cause for concern. SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.",

As of February 18, 2020, there were in total 75,201 confirmed cases worldwide. With the rapid spreading speed of R0 3.28, there is a heavy pres-sure for hospital assistant diagnosis, as some infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others (2) . Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic method that is sensitive, accurate, rapid and low-cost to screen infected individuals, facilitate proper isolation and help controlling the disease spread.",

This method has been widely used by Center for Disease Control and Prevention and other relevant departments worldwide. Recently RT-qPCR based methods were developed and applied worldwide by multiple research and disease control centers (10) . However, RT-qPCR has many limitations such as the need for high purity samples and the access to expensive laboratory instruments, as well as requiring long reaction times (at least 2 h). In addition, RT-qPCR needs trained personnel and sophisticated facilities for sample processing. These disadvantages limit its practical application in many cases, and thus can delay the required rapid prescription and administration of antiviral agents to patients.",

This is most likely due to the presence of Tris or EDTA in the RNA dilution buffer when automatic RNA extraction workstation is used. This could be optimized by adjusting the concentration of used buffers. We recommend to use always a positive and a negative control sample resuspended in the same buffers used for patient RNA isolation.",

Therefore the detection of COVID-19 is of vital importance. The first version of iLACO with six primers could specifically identify eight distinct regions of the ORF1ab target. Our blast analysis suggest that the highly specific primer set design have a low chance for unspecific amplifications (false positives).",

One sample kept unchanged color after 50 minutes, indicating the low dose of virus would cause false negative or spontaneous negative signal. To confirm this, we repeated this sample multiple times with random positive signal, confirming that this samples was close to the detection threshold using 2\u00b5l. Currently most the RT-qPCR reactions in China for SARS-CoV-2 test use 5 \u00b5l sample input. We thereby checked whether increasing the used sample volume would facilitate the detection.

The reaction time takes 20-30 minutes at 65\u00b0C. The result showed that by optimizing the concentration of primers, the total reaction time would be shorter for high dose virus carriers. iLACO detection method could not only detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus, but also worked on the cDNA samples.The use of iLACO will facilitate the widely application of virus detection test, especially in developing countries with limited facilities, and when compared with other assays that are laborious, costly, and time-consuming(23).",
