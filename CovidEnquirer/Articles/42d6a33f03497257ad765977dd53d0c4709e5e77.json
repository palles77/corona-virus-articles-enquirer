The beam from a 532-nm green laser (75 mW, CL532-075-L, CrystaLaser) was attenuated by a half-wave plate and a beam splitter before expanded 10\uf0b4 through a pair of convex lenses. A 2-inch iris was installed to cut the blur rim of the expanded Gaussian beam, which was focused on the back focal plane of a 100\uf0b4 oil immersion objective (UAPON 100XOTIRF, NA = 1.49, Olympus) by a 2-inch diameter, 300-mm focal-length convex lens. The lens position was adjusted to tune the reflection angle to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of fluorescence. In the microscope, the emitted light was separated from the excitation beam by a dichroic mirror (FF562-Di03-25x36, Semrock) and then passed through a dual-band emission filter (FF01-577/690-25, Semrock). A homebuild dual view system, containing another dichroic mirror (FF650-Di01-25x36, Semrock), was used to separate the signals from donor and acceptor dyes, which were imaged on an EMCCD camera (iXon DU-897D, Andor).
