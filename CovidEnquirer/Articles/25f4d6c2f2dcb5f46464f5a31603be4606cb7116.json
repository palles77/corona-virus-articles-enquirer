Conflicting correlations between trauma admissions and weather variables have previously been published. 1, 2, 14 However, admission to hospital is only necessary in a minority of fracture patients, and is therefore not a true representation of workload. It is recognised that periods of ice and snow are associated with a significant increase in 'walking wounded' patients, who have fractures affecting the upper limb and ankle. 14, 21, 23 These fractures are commonly treated by day-case surgery, or non-operatively in fracture clinics.

A severe weather warning for icy roads is likely to also indicate icy pavements. We report a significant increase in the number of walking wounded, predominantly resulting from low energy slips and falls rather than high energy road traffic accidents. This highlights the importance of ensuring We demonstrated a relationship between weather warnings and both the number of operations undertaken in our trauma department and theatres utilised in December 2008-January 2009, but this correlation was not evident the following year. Winter 2009/2010 was particularly extreme, with a number of sustained periods of icy weather.
