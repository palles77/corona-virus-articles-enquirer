However, data on nosocomial influenza is usually collected during outbreaks only and clinical information of nosocomial influenza is sparsely available. Objectives: To systematically analyse the distribution of nosocomial and community-acquired influenza and epidemiological characteristics in a tertiary care unit in two consecutive seasons. Study design: A retrospective observational study was conducted to identify and characterise cases of nosocomial and community-acquired influenza at Freiburg University hospital from 1 January 2013 to 30 April 2014. A validated multiplex RT-PCR to detect influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens was used throughout. Clinical information was retrieved from the hospital-based information system. Results: Overall, 218 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were included (179 in the first, 39 patients in the second season). A rate of 20% of nosocomial influenza was observed throughout. A fatal outcome was recorded for 9% of nosocomial cases, which were mainly associated with influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09. Nosocomial influenza occurred in all age groups, but fatalities were only observed in patients \u226518 years. Patients with nosocomial influenza were significantly older, underwent therapy for blood malignancies and immunosuppressive regimens more frequently, and received solid organ transplantation more often compared to community-acquired patients. Conclusions: Despite the different distribution of virus subtypes and epidemiological properties between both influenza seasons, the rate of nosocomial cases remained similar. Systematic detection and targeted prevention measures seem mandatory to minimize nosocomial influenza.",

Outbreaks of influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) in hospitals usually occur during the annual peak of community influenza activity. Of note, hospitalized patients are often vulnerable to infections, e.g. due to underlying medical problems or immunosuppressive therapies. Transmission of influenza within hospitals is facilitated by its short incubation time, transmission via respiratory droplets, and crowded places. The origin of nosocomial infections often remains unknown, but patients, health-care workers (HCW) and visitors are the most common sources of infection.",

However, in most countries there is no systematic surveillance warranting the early detection of nosocomial influenza, and studies are usually triggered by nosocomial outbreaks or the appearance of novel influenza viruses [1] . In addition, data on the clinical characteristics and baseline epidemiological data are only sparsely available for nosocomial influenza. This finding gives rise to the suspicion that a considerable proportion of cases remain undetected. Novel multiplex PCR assays facilitate the rapid detection of various respiratory pathogens including influenza virus. ",

The criteria for ILI included sudden onset of symptoms, at least one of four systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, headache, myalgia), and at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath) [2] . Severe influenza was defined by admission of a case-patient to an intensive care unit (ICU) or in-hospital death. Influenza-associated death was defined as death due to influenza as primary or contributing cause. Nosocomial influenza was defined as a case-patient with symptom onset \u226572 h after admission to hospital and admission not related to respiratory symptoms. Testing of patients for influenza was performed upon request of the treating physician. We extracted the positive influenza results from our laboratory information system and clinical information was retrieved from the hospital-based information system. Influenza vaccination history was collected by the local public health authorities or obtained from the patient's general practitioner. Routine conventional bacteriology was not uniformly performed for all patients and is not reported in this study. Informed consent was obtained and documented by contract between patients and Freiburg University Medical Center.",

Total nucleic acid was extracted from samples using the QIAmp MinElute Virus kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on an automated QIAcube (Qiagen) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Detection of respiratory pathogens was done using the FTD respiratory pathogens 21 kit (Fast track diagnostics, Junglingster, Luxemburg). The assay is able to detect influenza A and B viruses, and also enables detection on a subtype level for A(H1N1) pdm09. In addition, the assay is capable to detect coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, enterovirus/parechovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, human metapneumovirus A/B, human bocavirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A/B, and adenovirus. Of note, all samples positive in the general influenza A assay were classified as A(H3N2) without further typing. This was based on the finding that only influenza virus A(H1N1) pdm09 and A(H3N2) had circulated in Germany from 2010 on according to national surveillance data [3] . Thermal cycling was done using an ABI 7500 machine (Applied Biosystems, Wiesbaden, Germany) as recommended. The FTD respiratory pathogens 21 kit was supplemented with three in-house real-time PCR assays for the detection of Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila, and Chlamydia pneumonia as described elsewhere [4] .",

All other nosocomial cases were scattered throughout the hospital supporting the notion of a random and irregular introduction of influenza into the hospital. In contrast, the following season was comparably less severe according to national surveillance data. However, the rate of nosocomial infections was similar and highlights the importance of strict adherence to year-round infection control guidelines irrespective of the annual influenza activity [1] .

The high number of fatalities associated with influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 has already been described in the first post-pandemic seasons [9] . It might be speculated that immunosuppressive therapies constitute an independent risk factor for fatal outcome. Inter alia influenza vaccination is recommended in Germany for persons older than 60 years of age, for HCW, for those with underlying disease, and for those who are immunosuppressed. Vaccine failure (i.e. influenza despite previous vaccination) was observed more often in immunosuppressed patients compared to immunocompetent individuals. It must be recognized, however, that vaccine effectiveness can be lower in immunocompromised individuals compared to the healthy ones [10, 11] . It is evident, that there is an overall need to improve vaccination rates in those at highest risk, and vaccination campaigns including those targeting HCW should be decidedly promoted. Critically, influenza vaccines might prove less effective due to antigenic drift as seen in the influenza season 2014/15 [12] . Thus, for the future a concept of a \"universal\" influenza vaccine is highly desirable [13] .",

This supports the notion that underreporting of nosocomial cases in our study seems likely since multiplex testing was initiated upon request of the physician only. Ideally, during influenza epidemics screening of all patients irrespective of ILI would allow early case detection and proper patient management including isolation or cohorting. However, data on overall benefit for the patients and overall costs of such an approach are lacking so far. We have now implemented an online-database in cooperation between the Institute of Virology and the Department of Environmental Health Sciences to detect nosocomial cases prospectively. Results from routine multiplex testing for respiratory pathogens are submitted on a daily basis and cases with a positive multiplex PCR result are now actively investigated. Preliminary analysis of our database showed a rate of 17% of nosocomial infections in 2014/15.",

In our study, it remains open to which extent infected health care workers or visitors were the source for nosocomial cases. However, it is well known that, during influenza epidemics, HCW serve as an important virus reservoir and can initiate nosocomial influenza outbreaks [1, 18] . Unfortunately, we could not determine the vaccination status of HCW at our university hospital. Among other important issues e.g. increasing vaccination rates, it should be discussed if active surveillance including rapid detection and notification can be initiated on wards caring for patients at increased risk for nosocomial influenza. Prospective studies may elucidate the feasibility and possible benefit of this approach and are needed to confirm the findings of our and previous studies on nosocomial influenza.",
