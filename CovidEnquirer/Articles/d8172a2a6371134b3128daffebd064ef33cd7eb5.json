This effect of TPA was blocked by staurosporine, a potent protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase C in astrocyte proliferation. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation, enhanced both the normal and TPA-induced proliferation of astrocytes. Authentic prostaglandin E 2 blocked this effect of indomethacin and also partially blocked the effect of TPA, suggesting that the intracellular mechanisms involved in prostaglandin E2-regulated astrocyte growth might differ from those acting in protein kinase-dependent growth. The effect of prostaglandin E 2 was blocked by a specific anti-prostaglandin E 2 polycional antibody. Cultured astrocytes and microglia produced and released prostaglandin E 2 in response to stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide, TPA, and lymphokines. Since the sensitivity of astrocytes and microglia to these stimuli was different, prostaglandin E 2 may differentially regulate astrocyte proliferation under different physiological conditions, acting in an autocrine fashion for astrocytes and in a paracrine fashion for microglia.",

            "text": "Astrocytes are a type of glial cell and they provide structural support for neurons. There is also growing evidence that astrocytes have additional functions since they have been shown to synthesize and/or respond to a variety of growth factors 2\u00b0 and cytokines, including interleukin 111, interleukin 6 7'43, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor 19'31, and tumor necrosis factor O~ 40 '43. It has also been demonstrated that certain factors control both the activity and proliferation of astrocytes via intracellular signaling mechanisms. Protein kinase C is one of the key enzymes involved in intracellular signaling and its activation has been implicated in a wide range of cellular processes 27'28. One of the most important roles of protein kinase C is modulation of the process of cell growth and division ~'27. Brain tissue has the highest protein kinase C content in the body ~5'23 and the density and distribution of phorbol ester binding sites in the fetal brain suggest a role for this enzyme in both developmental processes and cell growth 25. The existence of protein kinase C has also been demonstrated in primary astrocyte cultures 37 and it has been shown that mediators such as neurotransmitters or growth factors can stimulate protein kinase C activity 26. A phorbol ester was recently shown to induce the proliferation of cultured astrocytes 2. Therefore, protein kinase C seems to be involved in the promotion of astrocyte growth both in the developmental stage and under certain pathological conditions. Molecular cloning of the cDNA for protein kinase C has recently clarified the existence of multiple subtypes of this enzyme 5'16'18'3\u00b0'32'36, and there appear to be at least seven subtypes (a-~', including two /3 subspecies) 29. The mammalian brain has been shown to contain at least four subtypes, a, /3I, /311, and ,~33, by immunohistochemical analysis; they were localized in neurons 38 and in glial cells 1\u00b0.",

An attractive hypothesis is that growth factors or cytokines may activate astrocyte proliferation and subsequently induce prostaglandin E 2 production, which then downregulates astrocyte growth in an autoregulatory circuit. This hypothesis has been supported by a number of studies on lymphocytes, which have demonstrated that prostaglandin E 2 suppresses the activity or growth of both macrophages and T cells 9'12'13.

Staurosporine also inhibited unstimulated astrocyte proliferation (Fig. 2) . These observations suggest that protein kinase C may be involved in astrocyte proliferation under both unstimulated and TPA-stimulated conditions. This hypothesis was supported by the result that astrocytes expressed protein kinase C (Fig. 1B) . Glial cells are reported to be rich in immunoreactive protein kinase C t\u00b0 and a [3H]phorbol ester has been found to bind to glial ceils at a high level 4. In general, when cells are stimulated with TPA, protein kinase C activity is translocated from the cytosol to the membrane 2 or to the nucleus 27. Translocation of its activity to the nucleus seems to be necessary for DNA synthesis, suggesting that protein kinase C may be a key enzyme involved in cell proliferation. A similar mechanism may be involved in the astrocyte proliferation.",

To identify what type of prostaglandins inhibit astrocyte proliferation, we added the authentic prostaglandins to astrocyte cultures. An excess of prostaglandin E 2 reduced both unstimulated and stimulated proliferation of astrocytes (Fig. 5) . This inhibitory effect was blocked by an antibody to prostaglandin E 2 (Fig. 5) . These findings indicate that this prostaglandin apparently functions as an inhibitory regulator of astrocyte proliferation.",

The stimuli used in this experiment were designed to represent different physiological and pathological conditions 41. Thus, the addition of LPS, TPA, and the crude lymphokine preparation, respectively, represented the effect of bacterial antigens on the brain, the effect of protein kinase C activation by growth factors 42 and the effect of peripheral immune activation on the brain. Prostaglandin production by astrocytes and microglia differed in response to these stimuli (Fig. 6) , suggesting that this prostaglandin may regulate astrocyte proliferation in a differential manner. That is, in astrocytes it may act in an autocrine fashion and be sensitive to phorbol ester stimulation, while in microglia it appears to act in a paracrine fashion and be sensitive to LPS stimulation.",

An increased central nervous system level of prostaglandin E 2 has been reported in multiple sclerosis 21 and in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis 3.
