A positive fungal culture required the presence of fungal colonies, except non-cryptococcus yeast. The multiplex PCR used was the commercial kit BioFire FilmArray\u00d2 that can detect adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenzae A, influenzae B, parainfluenza (subtypes 1e4), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) was diagnosed per guidelines [6] . A change in management was defined by escalation or de-escalation of antibiotics, antifungals, or antivirals, adaptation of antifungals, or initiation of prednisone within 7 days after BAL since this is the time interval to obtain AGA results at the authors' institution. Deescalation was defined as cessation of one or multiple agents, conversion to oral therapy, or transition to a more narrow spectrum. Escalation was defined as adding a new antimicrobial agent or transitioning to a broader spectrum. Fungal adaptation was a transition to an alternative agent within the same class of antifungals. Antimicrobial use within 7 days of BAL was considered prior therapy.",

We believe it changes practice as BAL is not only valuable when results are positive, but when an aggregate negative BAL work up offers assurance for providers to address noninfectious etiologies. This is critical in intensive care settings when antiinflammatory therapy, such as high dose steroids, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, or T-cell depleting agents are considered for pulmonary graft versus host disease, with suspected superimposed infection. Only 5 patients required initiation of targeted therapy for a microorganism isolated on bacterial culture that was not previously covered, including virulent organisms such as Nocardia nova complex, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilis influenzae, and Stentrophomonas maltophilia. Antibiotics were also escalated due to severity of illness despite negative culture data (n\u00bc8) and to cover an alternative infection (n\u00bc6), such as endocarditis. Likely the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis effectively limited bacterial infections due to susceptible organisms, but may have added to the selection of more resistant bacteria such as Stenotrophomonas and Nocardia spp.",

BAL assisted in the diagnosis of these infections. This finding is important in that delays in treatment carry the potential for increased mortality [8] . This is recognized in the 2019 American Thoracic Society guidelines, which suggest moving to BAL AGA and requesting BAL Aspergillus PCR when serum AGA is negative. At a cutoff of 0.5, the serum AGA sensitivity is approximately 74e88% and at 1.0, it is 79e88%. At a cutoff of 1.5, sensitivity reduces to 59% and specificity increases to 95%. For BAL AGA with a cutoff of 1.0, the sensitivity and specificity increases to 90% and 94% respectively [9] . In addition, Aspergillus spp. accounts for only 70% of invasive fungal infections in AHSCT, and the remaining 30% includes deadly pathogens including zygomycetes (6e8%), fusarium (6e7% in USA), dematiaceous, and other rare molds that may require culture or tissue biopsy diagnosis. Endemic mycoses only account for 1% of invasive fungal infections in AHSCT and may be amenable to serologic or antigen testing without invasive procedures [8] .",

It is unclear if this multiplex PCR test is adequate for diagnosing LRTI and more studies will need to be done to evaluate this. BAL remained necessary to detect coinfections, as 9/13 patients with a positive multiplex PCR also had a positive bacterial culture (n\u00bc2) or elevated AGA (n\u00bc7) ( Table I) .",

A control group comparison (with or without available sputum cultures, nasal multiplex respiratory pathogen panel, serum AGA and fungal urine antigen testing) would be likely biased to include those who were deemed less sick as well as those considered too high risk to be eligible for bronchoscopy, due to high oxygen requirement or bleeding risk.
