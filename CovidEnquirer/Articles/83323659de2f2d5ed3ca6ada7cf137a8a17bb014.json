Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. In order to obtain nearequipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued structure-based design of peptidomimetic a-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Six crystal structures of protease:inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. Compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell-toxic. Optimization of the P2 substituent of the aketoamides proved crucial for achieving near-equipotency against the three virus genera. The best near-equipotent inhibitors, 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl) and 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl), display low-micromolar EC50 values against enteroviruses, alphacoronaviruses, and betacoronaviruses in cell cultures. In Huh7 cells, 11r exhibits three-digit picomolar activity against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.",

Notably, unexpected differences between alpha-and betacoronavirus M pro were found in this study. The structural foundation of these was elucidated in detail in a subproject involving the M pro of HCoV NL63; because of its volume, this work will be published separately (Zhang et al., in preparation) and only some selected findings are referred to here. The main protease of the newly discovered coronavirus linked to the Wuhan outbreak of respiratory illness is 96% identical (98% similar) in amino-acid sequence to that of SARS-CoV M pro (derived from the RNA genome of BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019, Genbank accession code: MN908947.2; http://virological.org/t/initialgenome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319, last accessed on January 11, 2020), so all results reported here for inhibition of SARS-CoV will most likely also apply to the new virus.",

            "text": "Seventeen years have passed since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, but there is yet no approved treatment for infections with the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 1 One of the reasons is that despite the devastating consequences of SARS for the affected patients, the development of an antiviral drug against this virus would not be commercially viable in view of the fact that the virus has been rapidly contained and did not reappear since 2004. As a result, we were empty-handed when the Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a close relative of SARS-CoV, emerged in 2012. 2 MERS is characterized by severe respiratory disease, quite similar to SARS, but in addition frequently causes renal failure 3 . Although the number of registered MERS cases is low (2494 as of November 30, 2019; www.who.int), the threat MERS-CoV poses to global public health may be even more serious than that presented by SARS-CoV. This is related to the high casefatality rate (about 35%, compared to 10% for SARS), and to the fact that MERS cases are still accumulating seven years after the discovery of the virus, whereas the SARS outbreak was essentially contained within 6 months. The potential for human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been impressively demonstrated by the 2015 outbreak in South Korea, where 186 cases could be traced back to a single infected traveller returning from the Middle East. 4 SARS-like coronaviruses are still circulating in bats in China, [5] [6] [7] [8] from where they may spill over into the human population; this is probably what caused the current outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, which is linked to a seafood and animal market. The RNA genome (Gen-Bank accession code: MN908947.2; http://virological.org/t/initialgenome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319, last accessed on January 11, 2020) of the new betacoronavirus features around 82% identity to that of SARS-CoV.",

A possible solution to the problem could be the development of broadspectrum antiviral drugs that are directed against the major viral protease, a target that is shared by all coronavirus genera as well as, in a related form, by members of the large genus Enterovirus in the picornavirus family. Among the members of the genus Alphacoronavirus are the human coronaviruses (HCoV) NL63 (ref. 9) and 229E 10 that usually cause only mild respiratory symptoms in otherwise healthy individuals, but are much more widespread than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Therapeutic intervention against alphacoronaviruses is indicated in cases of accompanying disease such as cystic fibrosis 11 or leukemia, 12 or certain other underlying medical conditions. 13 The enteroviruses include pathogens such as EV-D68, the causative agent of the 2014 outbreak of the \"summer flu\" in the US, 14 EV-A71 and Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16), the etiological agents of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD), 15 Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), which can cause myocardic inflammation, 16 and human rhinoviruses (HRV), notoriously known to lead to the common cold but also capable of causing exacerbations of asthma and COPD. 17 Infection with some of these viruses can lead to serious outcome; thus, EV-D68 can cause polio-like disease, 18 and EV-A71 infection can proceed to aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, pulmonary edema, viral myocarditis, and acute flaccid paralysis. 15, [19] [20] Enteroviruses cause clinical disease much more frequently than coronaviruses, so that an antiviral drug targeting both virus families should be commercially viable.",

            "text": "However, enteroviruses are very different from coronaviruses. While both of them have a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity, that of enteroviruses is very small (just 7 -9 kb) whereas coronaviruses feature the largest RNA genome known to date (27 -34 kb) . Enteroviruses are small, naked particles, whereas coronaviruses are much larger and enveloped. Nevertheless, a related feature shared by these two groups of viruses is their type of major protease, 21 which in the enteroviruses is encoded by the 3C region of the genome (hence the protease is designated 3C pro ). In coronaviruses, non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5) is the main protease (M pro ). Similar to the enteroviral 3C pro , it is a cysteine protease in the vast majority of cases and has therefore also been called \"3C-like protease\" (3CL pro ). The first crystal structure of a CoV M pro or 3CL pro (ref. 22) revealed that two of the three domains of the enzyme together resemble the chymotrypsin-like fold of the enteroviral 3C pro , but there is an additional a-helical domain that is involved in the dimerization of the protease (Fig. 1A) . This dimerization is essential for the catalytic activity of the CoV M pro , whereas the enteroviral 3C pro (Fig. 1B) functions as a monomer. Further, the enteroviral 3C pro features a classical Cys...His...Glu/Asp catalytic triad, whereas the CoV M pro only has a Cys...His dyad. 22 Yet, there are a number of common features shared between the two types of proteases, in particular their almost absolute requirement for Gln in the P1 position of the substrate and space for only small amino-acid residues such as Gly, Ala, or Ser in the P1' position, encouraging us to explore the coronaviral M pro and the enteroviral 3C pro as a common target for the design of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds. The fact that there is no known human protease with a specificity for Gln at the cleavage site of the substrate increases the attractivity of this viral target, as there is hope that the inhibitors to be developed will not show toxicity versus the host cell. Indeed, neither the enterovirus 3C pro inhibitor rupintrivir, which was developed as a treatment of the common cold caused by HRV, nor the peptide aldehyde inhibitor of the coronavirus M pro that was recently demonstrated to lead to complete recovery of cats from the normally fatal infection with Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV), showed any toxic effects on humans or cats, respectively. 23, 24 Figure 1: Crystal structures of SARS-CoV main protease (M pro , ref. 26 ; PDB entry 2BX4) and Coxsackivirus B3 3C protease (3C pro ; Tan et al., unpublished; PDB entry 3ZYD). Catalytic residues are indicated by spheres (yellow, Cys; blue, His; red: Glu). A. The coronavirus M pro is a homodimer, with each monomer comprising three domains. B. The structure of the monomeric CVB3 3C pro resembles the Nterminal two domains of the SARS-CoV M pro . Structure is on the same scale as image A. C. Superimpostion of residues from the two structures involved in ligand binding. Superimposition was carried out by aligning the catalytic Cys-His pair of each protease. Residues of the SARS-CoV M pro are shown with carbon atoms in cyan, CVB3 3C pro residues have orange carbons and are labeled with an asterisk (*).",

This moiety has been found to be a good mimic of glutamine and enhance the power of the inhibitors by up to 10-fold, most probably because compared to the flexible glutamine side-chain, the more rigid lactam leads to a reduction of the loss of entropy upon binding to the target protease. 29, 32 Our synthetic efforts therefore aimed at optimizing the substituents at the P1', P2, and P3 positions of the a-ketoamides.",

The in-situ cyclization of the resulting intermediate afforded the lactam 2. The lactam derivative 3 was generated by removal of the protecting group of 2. On the other hand, the amidation of acyl chloride and a-amino acid methyl ester afforded the intermediates 4, which gave rise to the acids 5 via alkaline hydrolysis. The key intermediates 6 were obtained via the condensation of the lactam derivative 3 and the N-capped amino acids 5. The ester group of compounds 6 was then reduced to the corresponding alcohol. Oxidation of the alcohol products 7 by Dess-Martin periodinane generated the aldehydes 8, which followed by nucleophilic addition with isocyanides gave rise to compounds 9 under acidic conditions.

The resulting thiohemiketal is in the R configuration in the SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 M pro but in the S configuration in the CVB3 3C pro complex. The reason for this difference is that the oxygen atom of the thiohemiketal accepts a hydrogen bond from the catalytic His40 in the CVB3 protease, rather than from the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole as in the SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 enzymes (Fig. 3a ,b,c insets). It is remarkable that we succeeded in obtaining a crystal structure of compound 11a in complex with the HCoV-NL63 M pro , even though it has no inhibitory effect on the activity of the enzyme (IC50 > 50 \u00b5M), (Fig. 2c) . Apparently, the compound is able to bind to this M pro in the absence of peptide substrate, but cannot compete with substrate for the binding site due to low affinity. A similar observation has been made in one of our previous studies, where we were able to determine the crystal structure of a complex between the inactive Michaelacceptor compound SG74 and the EV-D68 3C pro (ref. 29 ; PDB entry 3ZV9).

To investigate whether the P3 residue of the inhibitor is dispensible, we synthesized compound 11f, which only comprises P2 = Boc, P1 = GlnLactam, and P1' = benzyl. 11f was inactive against all purified proteases and in all replicons tested, but showed some activity against HRV2 in HeLa Rh cells (EC50 = 9.0 \u00b5M). A crystal structure of 11f bound to HCoV-NL63 M pro demonstrated that the P2-Boc group entered the S2 pocket (Fig. 3d ).

The P2-benzyl substituent of 11a cannot fully enter the S2 pocket of the HCoV-NL63 M pro , which is much smaller and has less plasticity than the corresponding pocket of SARS-CoV M pro (cf. A). The benzyl therefore binds above the pocket in the view shown here; this is probably the reason for the total inactivity (IC50 > 50 \u00b5M) of compound 11a against HCoV-NL63 M pro . The small size of the pocket is due to the replacement of the flexible Gln189 of the SARS-CoV M pro by the more rigid Pro189 in this enzyme. The stereochemistry of the thiohemiketal is R.

This resulted in improved activities against SARS-CoV M pro (IC50 = 0.33 \u00b5M) and in a very good activity against HCoV-NL63 M pro (IC50 = 1.08 \u00b5M, compare with the inactive 11a). For EV-A71 3C pro , however, the activity decreased to IC50 = 13.8 \u00b5M, different from CVB3 3C pro , where IC50 was 3.8 \u00b5M. Our interpretation of this result is that the smaller P2-isobutyl substituent of 11n can still interact with the \"lid\" (in particular, Met49) of the SARS-CoV M pro S2 site, but is unable to reach the \"back-wall\" of the EV-A71 3C pro pocket and thus, in the absence of a \"lid\", cannot generate sufficient enthalpy of binding. We will see from examples to follow that this trend persists among all inhibitors with a smaller P2 substituent: Even though the SARS-CoV M pro S2 pocket has a larger volume than that of the enterovirus 3C pro , the enzyme can be efficiently inhibited by compounds carrying a small P2 residue that makes hydrophobic interactions with the lid (Met49) and floor (Met165) residues.",

Even for the HCoV-NL63 M pro , against which 11a was completely inactive, greatly improved albeit still weak activity was observed (Table 1 ). In the viral replicons, 11r performed very well, with EC50 = 0.8 -0.9 \u00b5M for the EV-A71 replicon, 0.45 \u00b5M for CVB3, and 1.4 \u00b5M for SARS-CoV (Table 2 ).

Against HCoV 229E in Huh7 cells, the EC50 was surprisingly low (1.8 \u00b5M). Interestingly, the compound proved extremely potent against MERS-CoV in Huh7 cells, with EC50 = 0.0004 \u00b5M (400 picomolar!). Even in Vero cells, EC50 against MERS-CoV was 5 \u00b5M, and the EC50 against SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells was 1.8 -2.1 \u00b5M, i.e. the best activity we have seen for an M pro inhibitor against SARS-CoV in this type of cells. The therapeutic index (CC50/EC50) of 11r against EV-D68, HRV2, and HRV14 was >15 in HeLa Rh cells as well as against CVB3 in Huh-T7 cells, but only ~5 for EV-A71 in RD cells.",

            "text": "We next analyzed the crystal structure of the complex between SARS-CoV M pro and compound 11s (Fig. 3f) . The cyclopropylmethyl substituent was found to be incorporated deeply into the S2 pocket, making hydrophobic interactions with Met49 (the lid), Met165 (the floor), and the Cb of Asp187 (the back-wall). In spite of the small size of the P2 substituent, this is possible because the S2 pocket of SARS-CoV M pro is flexible enough to contract and enclose the P2 moiety tightly. This plasticity is expressed in a conformational change of residue Gln189, both in the main chain and in the side-chain. The main-chain conformational change is connected with a flip of the peptide between Gln189 and Thr190. The c1 torsion angle of the Gln189 side-chain changes from roughly antiperiplanar (ap) to (-)synclinal (-sc) (Fig. 4) . The conformational variability of Gln189 has been noted before, both in Molecular Dynamics simulations 26 and in other crystal structures. 37 As a consequence of these changes, the sidechain oxygen of Gln189 can accept a 2.54-\u00c5 hydrogen bond from the main-chain NH of the P2 residue in the 11s complex (see Fig. 4 ). The affinity of 11s for the S2 pocket of HCoV-NL63 M pro is good because of an almost ideal match of size and not requiring conformational changes, which this enzyme would not be able to undergo because of the replacement of the flexible Gln189 by the more rigid Pro. On the other hand, docking of the same compound into the crystal structure of the CVB3 3C pro revealed that the cyclopropylmethyl moiety was probably unable to generate sufficient Free Energy of binding because of the missing lid and the large size of the S2 pocket in the enterovirus 3C pro , thereby explaining the poor inhibitory activity of 11s against these targets. (Table 1) . Experiments with the viral replicons confirmed this trend, although the EC50 value for SARS-CoV (6.8 \u00b5M) was surprisingly high (Table 2 ). In Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV, this compound exhibited EC50 = 0.1 \u00b5M (but 9.8 \u00b5M in Vero cells), whereas EC50 was 7.0 \u00b5M against SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. The compound was largely inactive against EV-A71 in RD cells and inhibited the replication of the two HRV subtypes tested (in HeLa Rh cells) with EC50 values of ~4 \u00b5M. The CC50 of 11t in HeLa cells was 65 \u00b5M, i.e. the therapeutic index was well above 15 (Table 3) .",

In other words, the nearly equipotent 11u is indeed a compromise. Therefore, in view of the surprisingly good antiviral activity of 11r against HCoV 229E in Huh7 cells, we relaxed the condition that the universal inhibitor should show good activity against the recombinant HCoV-NL63 M pro , and selected 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl) as the lead compound for further development. This compound exhibited submicromolar IC50 values against CVB3 3C pro and SARS-CoV M pro , and IC50 = 1.7 \u00b5M against EV-A71 3C pro (Table 1) , as well as similarly low EC50 values in the replicons of these viruses (Table 2 ). In Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV, the performance of this compound was excellent, with EC50 = 0.0004 \u00b5M, and even against HCoV 229E in Huh7 cells and SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells, EC50 values of 1.8 and 2.1 \u00b5M, respectively, were observed (Table 3) .

The only concern is the activity of the compound against EV-A71 in RD cells, for which the EC50 value was 3.7 \u00b5M, resulting in too low a therapeutic index. On the other hand, only weak toxicity was detected for 11r in Vero or Huh-T7 cells.

Through crystallographic analyses of a total of six inhibitor complexes of three different proteases in this study, we found the a-ketoamide warhead (-CO-CO-NH-) to be sterically more versatile than other warheads such as Michael acceptors (-CH=CH-CO-) and aldehydes (-CH=O), because it features two acceptors for hydrogen bonds from the protein, namely the a-keto oxygen and the amide oxygen, whereas the other warheads have only one such acceptor. In the various complexes, the hydroxy group (or oxyanion) of the thiohemiketal that is formed by the nucleophilic attack of the activesite cysteine residue onto the a-keto carbon, can accept one or two hydrogen bonds from the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole. In addition, the amide oxygen of the inhibitor accepts a hydrogen bond from the catalytic His side-chain. Alternatively, the thiohemiketal can interact with the catalytic His residue and the amide oxygen with the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole. Depending on the exact interaction, the stereochemistry at the thiohemiketal C atom would be different. We have previously observed a similar difference in case of aldehyde inhibitors, where the single interaction point -the oxyanion of the thiohemiacetal -can accept a hydrogen bond either from the oxyanion hole or from the catalytic His side-chain, 37 resulting in different stereochemistry of the thiohemiacetal carbon. Both aketoamides and aldehydes react reversibly with the catalytic nucleophile of proteases, whereas Michael acceptors form irreversible adducts.",

In nearly all studies aiming at discovering peptidomimetic inhibitors of coronavirus M pro s, P2 is invariably isobutyl (leucine), and this residue has also been used in the efforts to design compounds that would inhibit enterovirus 3C pro s as well (see above). From crystal structures of our early lead compound, 11a (cinnamoyl-Phe-GlnLactam-CO-CO-NH-Bz), in complex with the M pro s of HCoV NL63 (as representative of the alphacoronavirus proteases) and SARS-CoV (beta-CoV) as well as the 3C pro of Coxsackievirus B3 (enterovirus proteases), we found that the S2 pocket has fundamentally different shapes in these enzymes. In the SARS-CoV M pro , the S2 subsite is a deep hydrophobic pocket that is truly three-dimensional in shape: the \"walls\" of the groove are formed by the polypeptide main chain around residues 186 -188 as well as by the side-chains of His41 (of the catalytic dyad) and Gln189, whereas the \"floor\" is formed by Met165 and the \"lid\" by residues 45 -51, in particular Met49. The two methionines provide important interaction points for the P2 substituents of inhibitors; while these interactions are mostly hydrophobic in character, we have previously described the surprising observation of the carboxylate of an aspartic residue in P2 that made polar interactions with the sulfur atoms of these methionines. 37 Because the pocket offers so many opportunities for interaction and features a pronounced plasticity, P2 substituents such as isobutyl (from Leu), which are too small to fill the pocket entirely, can still generate sufficient binding enthalpy. Accordingly, the S2 pocket of SARS-CoV M pro is the most tolerant among the three enzymes investigated here, in terms of versatility of the P2-substituents accepted.",

This is easily explained on the basis of the crystal structures: In the enterovirus 3C pro s, the fluorine can accept a hydrogen bond from Arg39 (ref. 30) , whereas in the coronavirus M pro s, there would be electrostatic repulsion from the main-chain carbonyls of residues 186 and 188. In agreement with this, rupintrivir (which has P2 = p-fluorobenzyl) is a good inhibitor of the enteroviral 3C pro s, 46 but not of the coronaviral main proteases, as we predicted earlier. 28 In this structure-based inhibitor optimization study, we achieved major improvements over our original lead compound, 11a, by systematically varying the size and the flexibility of the P2-substituent. The compound presenting so far the best compromise between the different requirements of the S2 pockets (SARS-CoV M pro : large and covered, HCoV-NL63 M pro : small and covered, and CVB3 3C pro : large and open) is 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl), which has satisfactory broad-spectrum activity against all proteases tested. However, with regard to its antiviral activities in cell cultures, it is inferior to 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl). The latter compound exhibits very good inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV M pro as well as the enterovirus 3C pro , and its performance in the SARS-CoV and enterovirus replicons is convincing. Being in the low micromolar range (EV-A71, CVB3), the data for the antiviral activity in cell culture for 11r correlate well with the inhibitory power of the compound against the recombinant proteases as well as in the replicon-based assays. This is not true, though, for the surprisingly good in-cellulo activity of 11r against HCoV 229E in Huh7 cells. Also, the correlation does not seem to hold for LLC-MK2 and CaCo2 cells. We tested the antiviral activity of many of our compounds against HCoV NL63 in these two cell types and found that all of them had low-or submicromolar EC50 values against this virus in LLC-MK2 cells but were largely inactive in CaCo2 cells (not shown). Furthermore, 11r and all other compounds that we synthesized are inactive (EC50 > 87 \u00b5M) against CVB3 in Vero cells (not shown), but exhibit good to excellent activities against the same virus in Huh-T7 cells. We have previously observed similar poor antiviral activities in Vero cells not only for aketoamides, but also for Michael acceptors (Zhu et al., unpublished work) . A similar cell-type dependence is seen for the antiviral activity of 11r against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Whereas the inhibitor exhibits excellent activity against MERS-CoV when Huh7 cells are the host cells (400 pM), the inhibitory activity is weaker by a factor of up to 12,500 when Vero cells are used (EC50 = 5 \u00b5M). On the other hand, 11r exhibits excellent anti-MERS-CoV activity in human Calu3 lung cells, i.e. in the primary target cells where the compound will have to act in a therapeutic setting (A. Kupke, personal communication). As we tested antiviral activity against SARS-CoV exclusively in Vero cells, the EC50 values determined for our compounds against this virus are in the one-digit micromolar range or higher; the best is again compound 11r with EC50 = 2.1 \u00b5M. Interestingly, the relatively weaker activity (or even inactivity) of our inhibitors against RNA viruses in Vero cells was observed independently in the virology laboratories in Leuven and in Leiden. It is thus unlikely that the lack of activity in Vero cells is related to problems with the experimental set-up. In preliminary experiments, we replaced the P3 cinnamoyl group of 11r by the fluorophor coumaryl and found by fluorescence microscopy that much more inhibitor appeared to accumulate in Huh7 cells compared to Vero cells (D.L., R.H. & Irina Majoul, unpublished).",

Crystallization was performed by equilibrating 1 \u00b5L protein (mixed with 1 \u00b5L precipitant solution) against 500 \u00b5l reservoir containing 6 -8% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6,000, 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0), at 20\u2103 using the vapor diffusion sitting-drop method. Compounds 11a and 11s were dissolved in 100% DMSO at 50 mM and 200 mM stock concentrations, respectively. A crystal of the free enzyme was soaked in cryo-protectant buffer containing 20% MPD, 6% PEG 6,000, 0.1 M MES, 7.5 mM 11a, pH 6.0, for 2 h at 20\u2103. Another set of free enzyme crystals was soaked in another cryoprotectant buffer with 6% PEG 6,000, 5% MPD, 0.1 M MES, 15% glycerol, 10 mM 11s, pH 6.0, for 2 h. Subsequently, crystals were fished and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection.",

The dequenching of the Edans fluorescence due to the cleavage of the substrate as catalyzed by the proteases was monitored at 460 nm with excitation at 360 nm, using a Flx800 fluorescence spectrophotometer (BioTek). Curves of relative fluorescence units (RFU) against substrate concentration were linear for all substrates up to beyond 50 \u00b5M, indicating a minimal influence of the inner-filter effect. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared by dissolving them in 100% DMSO. The UV absorption of 11a was found to be negligible at l = 360 nm, so that no interference with the FRET signal through the inner-filter effect was to be expected.

Briefly, 24 h prior to infection, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2.5 x 10 4 (RD cells) or of 1.7 x 10 4 (HeLa Rh) per well in medium supplemented with 2% FCS. For HRV2 and HRV14 infection, the medium contained 30 mM MgCl2. The next day, serial dilutions of the compounds and virus inoculum were added. The read-out was performed 3 days post infection as follows: The medium was removed and 100 \u03bcl of 5% MTS in Phenol Red-free MEM was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, then the optical density at 498 nm (OD498) of each well was measured by microtiter plate reader (Saffire 2 , Tecan). The OD values were converted to percentage of controls and the EC50 was calculated by logarithmic interpolation as the concentration of compound that results in a 50% protective effect against virus-induced CPE. For each condition, cell morphology was also evaluated microscopically.",

The main differences here concern the main chain around Gln189 (note the flip of the 189 -190 peptide bond) as well as the side-chain of this flexible residue, conformational change of which allows the S2 pocket to \"shrink\" and adapt to the small size of the P2-substituent in 11s. This change also enables the formation of a hydrogen bond between the main-chain amide of the P2 residue and the side-chain oxygen of Gln189. The side-chains of Arg188 and Thr190 as well as the P1' substituent of the inhibitors have been omitted for clarity.We next introduced cyclobutylmethyl in the P2 position (compound 11t) and obtained the following results: IC50 = 1.4 \u00b5M for SARS-CoV M pro , 3.4 \u00b5M for HCoV-NL63 M pro , 10.8 \u00b5M for EV-A71 3C pro , and 4.8 \u00b5M for CVB3 3C pro",
