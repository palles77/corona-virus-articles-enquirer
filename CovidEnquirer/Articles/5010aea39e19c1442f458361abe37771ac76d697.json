In contrast, memory antiviral CD8 T cells in the spleen are PD-1 \u2212 , despite viral loads being similar in both the brain and spleen during persistent infection. Repetitive antigen engagement is central to sustained PD-1 expression by T cells in chronic viral infections; however, recent evidence indicates that expression of inhibitory receptors, including PD-1 is part of the T RM differentiation program. Here, we asked whether PD-1 expression by CD8 bT RM cells during persistent MuPyV encephalitis is antigen-dependent. By transferring MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM cells into brains of naive mice and mice infected with cognate epitope-sufficient and -deficient MuPyVs, we demonstrate that antigen and inflammation are dispensable for PD-1 maintenance. In vitro and direct ex vivo analyses indicate that CD103 \u2212 MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM retain functional competence. We further show that the Pdcd-1 promoter of anti-MuPyV bT RM cells is epigenetically fixed in a demethylated state in the brain. In contrast, the PD-1 promoter of splenic antiviral memory CD8 T cells undergoes remethylation after being demethylated during acute infection. These data show that PD-1 expression is an intrinsic property of brain T RM cells in a persistent CNS viral infection.",

For example, CD8 bT RM cells from mice with acutely resolved vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encephalitis express PD-1 transcripts, but not PD-1 receptors, whereas bT RMs from mice persistently infected with mouse cytomegalovirus are PD-1 +. [4] [5] [6] This discrepancy in PD-1 expression by bT RM cells raised the question whether antigen and/or inflammation is involved in maintenance of PD-1 expression by bT RM cells during CNS infection. Tissue-intrinsic factors are also dominant determinants of the dependence on antigen for CD8 T RM cell generation and/or maintenance. Antigen is required for T RM cell formation and CD103 upregulation in the brain and dorsal root ganglion 5, 7, 8 but not in the skin, small intestine, female reproductive tract, and salivary glands 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] . The role of antigen in maintenance of expression of PD-1 and CD103 by CD8 T RM cells in the brain remains to be determined.",

At day 9 postinfection (p.i.) the magnitude of the endogenous LT206-specific CD8 response in the brain, kidney, and spleen was similar to that of the donor TCR-I cells (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). Both the endogenous D b LT206-specific CD8 T cells and the TCR-I cells in acutely infected mice expressed PD-1 and CD69, with those in the brain having the highest level of expression (Fig. 1A) ; notably, virus levels in these organs were similar at day 9 and also at day 30 p.i. (Fig. 1B) . In addition to CD69, CD103 (\u03b1 E integrin) is often used identify T RM cells. 17 At day 9 p.i., D b LT206-specific CD8 T cells in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs did not express CD103; however, by day 30 p.i., a fraction of CD103 + endogenous and donor CD8 T cells were seen in the brain, but not the kidney or spleen. Despite a decline in virus levels by day 30 p.i. (Fig. 1B) , PD-1 expression was sustained on both endogenous D b LT206-specific CD8 T cells and TCR-I cells in the brain and kidney, but not those in the spleen (Fig. 1A) , as was CD69; (Fig. 1A) . Analysis of PD-1 transcript levels in TCR-I cells from spleen at days 8 and 30 p.i. showed that splenic memory TCR-I cells expressed lower PD-1 mRNA levels than those from spleens of acutely infected mice, albeit this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 1C) . Discordance between PD-1 mRNA levels and surface expression by CD8 T RM cells was similarly observed in the VSV acute encephalitis infection model. 4 To determine whether PD-1 functionally inhibited MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells, we assayed intracellular IFN-\u03b3 production by TCR-I cells after stimulation by LT206 peptide-pulsed PD-L1 + DC2.4 cells in the presence of a PD-L1 blocking mAb. As shown in Fig. 1C , PD-L1 blockade resulted in a significant increase in frequency of IFN-\u03b3 expressing TCR-I cells from brains, kidney and spleen of mice at day 9 p.i. At day 30 p.i., PD-1 blockade increased the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 + cells only of brain-resident TCR-I cells, which expressed the highest levels of PD-1 among T cells from all the organs examined.",

In contrast, PD-1 expression by memory, TCR transgenic P14 CD8 T cells from LCMV clone13-infected mice declines following transfer to LCMV-immune mice or mice infected with a epitope-null mutant LCMV. 14 To directly ask whether cognate antigen and/or virus-associated inflammation was required for PD-1 expression by brain T RM cells, we sorted GFP + TCR-I cells from brains of Fig. 2A ) and by the absence of D b LT206 tetramer binding the endogenous CD8 T cells either in brain (Fig. 2B ) or in spleen (Supplemental Fig. 2B ) of uninfected recipient mice. Na\u00efve TCR-I cells transferred into mice infected by MuPyV.A2 failed to proliferate and did not upregulate CD44, indicating that maintenance of PD-1 expression by TCR-I T RM cells in MuPyV.A2-infected recipients could not be attributed to cross-recognition of the D b LT359 epitope (Supplemental Fig. 2C ). These data suggest that TCR stimulation and the inflammatory environment of persistent MuPyV CNS infection are dispensable for maintenance of PD-1 expression by antiviral brain T RM cells.",

            "text": "CD8 T RM cell populations defined by differential CD103 expression have been reported to vary in proliferative potential, transcriptome, antigen-dependence, and tissue distribution. 4, 5, 18, 19 CD103 expression by donor TCR-I cells, however, was higher than on the endogenous D b LT359 or D b LT206 CD8 T cells (Fig. 2C, D) , a difference that may be linked to the higher survival potential of CD103 + cells in the brain. 5 We thus asked whether MuPyV-specific CD103 \u2212 CD8 T cells infiltrating the brain express phenotypic and functional characteristics of T cell exhaustion. Both CD103 + and CD103 \u2212 D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells were maintained in the absence of circulating CD8 cells (Fig.  3A) , suggesting that each of these populations is comprised of T RM cells. CD103 + and CD103 \u2212 D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells also expressed similar levels of PD-1 and Tim3 (Fig.  3B ). Of note, the CD103 \u2212 subset expressed higher TCF-1 levels and had higher proportion of CXCR5 hi TCF-1 hi cells compared to the CD103 + cells. Elevated TCF-1 expression as well as the presence of a CXCR5 hi TCF-1 hi population by memory CD8 T cells in chronic infection models have been reported to exhibit improved functional capability. 20, 21 BLIMP-1 and Eomesodermin (EOMES) T-box transcription factors are highly expressed by exhausted CD8 T cells 22, 23 ; however, CD103 \u2212 D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells were found to express lower BLIMP-1 and higher EOMES levels than the CD103 + cells. These populations also showed similar Ki67 expression levels, indicating their comparable rates of proliferation during persistent MuPyV CNS infection (Fig. 3C) . Taken together, the pattern of expression of these molecules indicates that CD103 \u2212 cells lack a phenotype associated with T cell exhaustion. Moreover, CD103 \u2212 and CD103 + LT359 peptide-stimulated CD8 T cells from brains of persistent MuPyV-infected mice exhibited similar frequencies of intracellular IFN-\u03b3 production (Fig. 3D) . To assess IFN-\u03b3 production directly ex vivo by CD103 \u2212 and CD103 + MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells in brains of persistently infected mice, IFN-\u03b3 EYFP reporter mice were inoculated with MuPyV.A2 virus i.c. As shown in Fig. 3E , a higher fraction of CD103 + than CD103 \u2212 D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells were EYFP + , a pattern paralleled by expression of IRF4, a transcription factor upregulated by TCR stimulation. 24 The discrepancy between similar frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD103 + and CD103 \u2212 bTRM cells following LT359 peptide stimulation vs lower EYFP + and IRF4 + by the CD103-population may reflect regional differences between the CD103 + and CD103 \u2212 cells in engaging viral antigen-expressing cells and/or differences in TCR affinity. 16 Although the CD103 integrin tethers T RM cells to E-Cadherin and is important for their preferential localization at epithelial tissues, CD103 \u2212 CD8 T RM cells exist in particular organs, including the brain. 5, 25 CD103 expression by CD8 T RM cells may also be influenced by the nature of the viral infection, as lung CD8 T RM cells to influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus express CD103 whereas those specific for human cytomegalovirus are CD103 \u2212.26",

            "text": "This locus was remethylated in the acutely resolved LCMV Armstrong infection, but remained demethylated in chronic LCMV clone13 infection even after host control of infection, a result tying PD-1 to the exhaustion state of differentiation. 13, 14 Stability of the demethylated Pdcd1 promoter was further demonstrated in human EBV, CMV, and HIVspecific CD8 T cells. 13, 27 It is yet to be confirmed whether the epigenetic changes observed at peripheral exhausted T cells holds true for bT RM cell population as well. The marked difference in PD-1 expression by memory MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells in spleen and brain led us to ask whether cells in these organs differed in level and stability of Pdcd1 promoter demethylation. Pdcd1 methylation status was analyzed on Thy1.1 TCR-I CD8 cells sorted from brains and spleens of acute (day 8 p.i.) and persistent (day 30 p.i.) infected recipient mice (Fig. 4A) . As expected, the Pdcd1 promoter in na\u00efve splenic TCR-I cells was almost entirely methylated (Fig. 4B,E) . At day 8 p.i., TCR-I cells in both spleen and brain exhibited extensive Pdcd1 promoter demethylation (Fig. 4C,E) . By day 30 p.i., however, TCR-I cells in the spleen showed increased methylation of the Pdcd1 promoter, while brain TCR-I cells retained a demethylated Pdcd1 promoter (Fig. 4D,F) . This intermediate level of methylation in TCR-I cells from day 30 infected mice was intermediate between cells from a na\u00efve or day 8 infected mice. This observation is consistent with the lower trending PD-1 transcript levels seen at day 30 p.i. (Fig 1C) . The PD-1 hi phenotype of the brain TCR-I T RM cells further suggests that a minimum threshold of Pdcd1 promoter demethylation facilitates upregulation of PD-1 gene expression. Thus, these data show that the Pdcd1 promoter of CD8 bT RM cells remains more extensively demethylated than splenic memory CD8 T cells despite having similar persistent MuPyV infection levels.",

[29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Our finding that PD-1 blockade elevates effector function by anti-MuPyV CD8 bT RM cell is in line with the concept that PD-1 expression by tissue-resident T cells may serve to restrain immunopathology, which would prove especially deleterious in the infected CNS. The divergence in PD-1 expression between brain and spleen MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells during persistent infection, with bT RM cells maintaining PD-1 in the absence of cognate antigen and inflammation, supports the concept that the brain microenvironment favors PD-1 expression.",

Seven days posttransfer, CD8 T cells from brains were co-stained with D b LT206 or D b LT359 tetramers (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, PD-1 expression was similar among donor TCR-I T RM cells in brains of mice regardless of expression of cognate epitope and/or virus-associated inflammation. CD69 and CD103 expression by the TCR-I cells in each recipient cohort was also similar, and unchanged from the original donor TCR-I cells, in Group 1 (Fig. 2C). High expression of PD-1, CD103 and CD69 by the donor TCR-I T RM cells in na\u00efve recipients was maintained up to day 25 post-transfer (Supplemental Fig. 1B). The possibility of MuPyV.LT206 virus carryover with the donor TCR-I cells is unlikely given the absence of detectable MuPyV DNA by quantitative PCR in brains of the uninfected recipients (Supplemental",
