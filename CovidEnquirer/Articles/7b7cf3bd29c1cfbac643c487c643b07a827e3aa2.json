Methods: In 2006, randomly selected employees (N = 549) of a hospital in Beijing were surveyed concerning their exposures to the city's 2003 SARS outbreak and the ways in which the outbreak had affected their mental health. Subjects were assessed on sociodemographic factors, on types of exposure to the outbreak, and on symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. Results: The results of multinomial regression analyses showed that, with other relevant factors controlled for, being single, having been quarantined during the outbreak, having been exposed to other traumatic events before SARS, and perceived SARS-related risk level during the outbreak were found to increase the odds of having a high level of depressive symptoms 3 years later. Altruistic acceptance of risk during the outbreak was found to decrease the odds of high post-outbreak depressive symptom levels. Conclusions: Policy makers and mental health professionals working to prepare for potential disease outbreaks should be aware that the experience of being quarantined can, in some cases, lead to long-term adverse mental health consequences.",

At the start of the 21st century, the international community experienced a similarly frightening public health emergency, on a global scale, with the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Severe acute respiratory syndrome was an unusual corona virus-based pneumonia that spread rapidly [1] . The SARS epidemic demonstrated that one effect of globalization has been to make it possible for an infectious disease to travel from one continent to another in a matter of hours and highlighted the importance of international coordination of efforts to respond to novel outbreaks of infectious disease. It was first detected in November 2002 in China's Guangdong province and eventually affected more than 25 countries. China was one of the most severely affected countries, and Beijing was among the world's most heavily affected cities, according to the World Health Organization's summary report [2, 3] .",

Using the hospital's employee rosters, the sample was stratified by profession and by age group. The physician and nurse groups were further stratified by level of work exposure to the SARS outbreak, according to the types of hospital units in which they had worked during the outbreak. Those who had worked in units where contact with patients with SARS had been frequent and intense, such as SARS wards, fever clinics, the department of infectious diseases, or the emergency department, were classified as having had \"high work exposure.\" Physicians and nurses falling into the high-work exposure category were oversampled. Hospital employees aged 35 to 55 years were also oversampled. The survey's participants completed a self-report questionnaire. The response rate was 83%.

Approximately 25% reported having worked in locations where contact with patients with SARS was common, whereas 19% had been quarantined either at work or at home during the SARS outbreak. Nine percent of respondents reported that a friend or close relative had contracted SARS. Of the 549 hospital employees, about 77.2% had CES-D scores lower than 16 and so were considered to have a low level of depressive symptoms. About 14.0% of the hospital employees had CES-D scores between 16 and 24 and were, thus, considered to have moderate levels of depressive symptoms. The remaining 8.8% had CES-D scores of 25 or higher. The members of this group were considered to have high levels of depressive symptoms. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 3 groups of hospital employees-those with low, moderate, and high current levels of depressive symptoms. The results of the bivariate analysis (Table 1) indicate that, among the sociodemographic factors, younger age and being single were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms in this sample. About 60% of those having high depressive symptom levels were 35 years old or younger, whereas 31% of those with CES-D scores lower than 16 were in this age range. About one third of those with high depressive symptoms were single, whereas only 10% of those with low CES-D score were single. With regard to the event exposure variables, both work exposure and any quarantining during the outbreak were strongly associated with current level of depressive symptoms. For example, among the group with the highest CES-D scores, 56% had worked in locations where staff had high levels of exposure to patients with SARS; and nearly 60% had been quarantined; whereas less than a quarter of those with low CES-D scores (21.3%) had worked in high exposure locations; and only 14.9% of the low depressive symptoms group had been quarantined. Having had a relative or friend contract SARS, on the other hand, was not significantly associated with level of depressive symptoms. Exposure to other traumatic events before the SARS outbreak was significantly associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. The respondents' perceived levels of SARS-related risk during the outbreak were also significantly and positively associated with their current levels of depressive symptoms, whereas altruistic acceptance of SARS-related risk was negatively associated with depressive symptom levels. Having experienced high levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms during and after the outbreak was strongly associated with current depressive symptom levels. Finally, the results also indicate that subjects who were currently working at relatively high-stress jobs also tended to report more current depressive symptoms.",

Table 2 , part A, reports the findings from the analysis comparing those having high depressive symptom levels (CES-D scores of 25 or higher) with those having low depressive symptom levels (CES-D scores of less than 16). In model 1, controlling for age, sex, marital status, family income, and prior exposure to . With regard to the other factors that had been previously identified as significant predictors, their associations with high depressive symptom levels remained essentially the same, except that the effect of high work exposure became nonsignificant in model 2, when perceived risk and altruistic acceptance of risk were included in the equation, and remained nonsignificant in model 3, when PTSD symptom level and the current high-stress job indicator were also included. Part B of Table 2 compares those with moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score between 16 and 24) with those with low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score less than 16). As expected, fewer factors were found, in this analysis, to be significantly predictive of group membership. The results from model 1 indicate that, with the sociodemographic factors controlled for, no significant differences were found between the 2 groups with regard to their SARS outbreak exposures. The 2 perception measures, that is, during-outbreak-perceived levels of SARS-related risk and altruistic acceptance of risk, added in model 2 each emerged as significantly predictive of group membership. The pattern of the associations found here is similar to that of the comparison between the high and low depressive symptoms groups, but the effect sizes are smaller. In model 3, when the PTSD symptom level and current high-stress job variables were entered into the equation, PTSD symptom level was also found to be significantly associated with level of depressive symptoms (AOR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.64-8.08; P = .0017). The effect of during-outbreak-perceived risk remained significant in model 3 (AOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03-1.32; P = .0183), whereas the effect of altruistic acceptance of risk was slightly attenuated and of only marginal significance (P = .0583).",

Employees' own fears of dying from the disease and of losing family members to it would, thus, have tended to be especially strong at the time when they were quarantined.",

Unlike in Canada, quarantining in China was often a group affair. Healthy hospital staff could be selected to be quarantined together with hospital patients and were often required to continue working, caring for those patients, while quarantined [39] . These quarantined health care staff would have known that, even if they had not already been infected with SARS, they would, because of being placed in these situations, remain at high risk of eventually becoming infected because of their continued contact with patients with SARS. However, those who continued working in these settings may also have experienced the satisfaction of knowing that they continued to play an important role in society that would have been valued by many of the patients they worked with. Again unlike their Canadian counterparts, however, most of the quarantined hospital employees in our sample experienced a period of at least 10 days of being unable to see or be with their families at all. (The median length of the quarantine periods was 14 days.) This aspect of their quarantining may have led to especially severe distress, but its effects are difficult to measure with any precision.",

This is somewhat in contrast to the finding of our previous study of the same hospital employee population [18] , which focused on post-outbreak symptoms of PTSD. In that study, pre-SARS traumatic experience was not found to be predictive of later SARS-related PTSD symptom levels. On the surface of it, the direction of this contrast seems surprising because traumatic experiences have frequently been found to be more strongly predictive of PTSD than of depression [41] [42] [43] [44] . It must be noted, however, that the IES-R, the instrument that we used to measure PTSD symptoms, was, like most instruments, designed to measure only PTSD symptoms associated with memories of a single specific event or set of events-in this case, the SARS outbreak. The respondents were not asked about PTSD symptoms they might currently be having because of sudden or violent traumas experienced before the SARS outbreak. It should also be noted that although the SARS outbreak was indeed a highly stressful, often traumatic, and life-threatening experience for those affected by it, the types of stressful events it engendered were somewhat different in nature from those mentioned in the instrument that was used to measure traumas had before SARS. The instrument had been adapted from one used in previous disaster research [23, 45] . The events described in the prior trauma instrument are generally sudden, noisy, and violent ones, unlike SARS, which caused harm to its victims in ways that were long-term rather than short-term and comparatively subtle, slow, and quiet. In this sense, the stresses caused by the SARS epidemic would not be expected to be evocative of the types of stresses mentioned in the prior trauma questions. Thus, perhaps it is not really surprising to find that the prior trauma items were, in our sample, predictive of respondents' later depressive symptoms but unrelated to their later symptoms of SARS-related PTSD. Some of our respondents may, unbeknownst to us, have been having either clinical-level or subthreshold PTSD syndromes linked to their memories of events that occurred before the SARS outbreak, which in turn may have been contributing to their relatively high levels of depressive symptoms. Future studies examining the psychologic effects of both recent and less recent traumatic experiences should consider the similarities and differences found between various types of traumatic experiences in designing their survey instruments.",

In the current study, perceived risk was found to be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms 3 years after the outbreak, even when controlling for PTSD symptom level. Reported altruistic acceptance of risk, on the other hand, was found to decrease the odds of having a high current level of depressive symptoms, even with control for exposure, PTSD symptoms, and sociodemographic factors, suggesting a buffering effect of altruistic acceptance of risk on the development of depressive symptoms after exposure to the outbreak. This study is limited by its cross-sectional nature; in addition, it was not possible for us to perform a true controlgroup comparison because no employee of the hospital-or 2003 Beijing resident-was completely without exposure to the SARS outbreak.
