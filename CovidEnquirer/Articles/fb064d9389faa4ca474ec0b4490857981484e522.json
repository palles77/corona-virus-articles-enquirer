            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is now known to be a common malady even though it was first recognized as a distinct clinicopathological entity less than 150 years ago. 1 The lack of clear medical reports before the early 1800s is sometimes interpreted as evidence that MS is a relatively new disease. However, it is more likely that the evolution of medicine into science led to more precise observation and description of human diseases, including MS. Saint Lidwina of Schiedam (1380-1433) developed a relapsing neurological disorder at the age of 18 and may be the first case of clinically described MS. 2 Ollivier was the first to report a clinical case in the medical literature in 1824. 1 Shortly thereafter, Carswell illustrated a case of what is now clearly recognizable as MS in his atlas of anatomical pathology. Cruveilhier published gross pathological and clinical descriptions of MS. Vulpian first suggested the rubric of \"sclerose en plaque\" in 1866. Charcot was primarily responsible for establishing MS as a unique and recognizable syndrome. 3 He also described the clinical spectrum and the histological appearance. Pierre Marie was the first to suggest an infectious cause of MS in 1884, a hypothesis that is still debated. Toxins were also considered to be responsible in the early 1900s. A major advance toward the understanding of demyelinating diseases was the discovery of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) by Rivers in 1935. 4 A variety of different demyelinating diseases have subsequently been described (Table 48 -1).",

The myelin coating is interrupted at regular intervals (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon membrane with its concentration of voltagegated sodium channels is exposed to the extracellular environment ( Fig. 48-1) . 5 The presence of myelin is essential to maintain conduction velocity; its loss or damage can lead to significantly slower conduction or conduction block.

Proteolipid protein (PLP) accounts for approximately 50% of the CNS myelin proteins. Mutations in this highly conserved protein cause Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. Protein zero is the major PNS myelin protein and performs a function similar to PLP in compacting the intraperiod line. Myelin basic protein (MBP) makes up 30% of CNS and 10% of PNS myelin proteins. MBP is not an integral protein but binds to the cytoplasmic surface and is responsible for compaction at the major dense line. Myelin associate glycoprotein accounts for about 1% of both peripheral and central myelin.

Pathologically, it is characterized by multifocal areas of demyelination, loss of oligodendrocytes, and astrogliosis but with relative preservation of axons. While demyelination is the classic hallmark of MS, axonal and neuronal injury are important aspects of the disease and are gaining more recognition. Although certain clinical features are characteristic of MS, investigative studies are often needed to confirm the clinical suspicion and exclude other possibilities. Recently, there have been advances in understanding the etiology, mechanisms of myelin injury, and potential for repair, and several partially effective agents are now approved for use in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS. The pathogenesis and pathophysiology of MS remains incompletely understood. Several mechanisms may be important to MS plaque formation: autoimmunity, infection, bystander demyelination, and heredity. Although convincing proof is lacking, dietary factors and toxin exposure have been hypothesized to contribute as well. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and the true pathophysiology is likely to depend on more than one of them.",

            "text": "Autoimmunity. During ontogenesis, autoreactive lymphocytes normally undergo clonal depletion, but some escape and are merely suppressed, becoming tolerant to their antigens. Low levels of autoreactive T and B cells persist even in normal individuals. Autoimmune disorders occur when the tolerance of these cells toward their antigen is broken. The decreased suppressor activity of circulating lymphocytes from patients with MS and other presumed autoimmune diseases may reflect loss of tolerance. 6 One potential mechanism that may break tolerance is molecular mimicry between self and foreign antigens. Autoreactive T4 lymphocytes may become activated on exposure to structurally similar foreign antigens. Some evidence suggests that molecular mimicry is relevant in MS. Not only do several viral and bacterial peptides share structural similarities with MBP, but it has also been demonstrated that these antigens may activate MBP-specific T-cell clones derived from MS patients. 7 Blood-brain barrier leakage alone may break tolerance because it gives CNSreactive lymphocytes easy access to otherwise inaccessible antigens. Alternatively, a primary event such as an infection or injury may release CNS antigens into the periphery, where they may activate corresponding autoreactive cells. 8 The major support for autoimmunity in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of MS is by analogy to EAE, the major animal model for MS. EAE is, however, an artificial situation and there is no spontaneous autoimmune animal model of MS. While EAE is the most commonly studied model of MS, several features of human MS can not be adequately captured by this model. 9, 10 Over a hundred different effective treatments have been described for EAE; however, almost all of them are ineffective and some are harmful in human MS. A recent editorial discusses the merits and important limitations of EAE as a model for MS. 10 In EAE, just like in classic human autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis, the main target antigens are known. However, despite the discovery of several \"weak\" antigens in human MS, no dominant antigens have been identified to date. The only human demyelinating disease with an identified specific antigen is Devic's disease (neuromyelitis optica), which appears to be a novel autoimmune chanellopathy with an antigen that is neither neuronal nor myelin related (see later discussion of Devic's syndrome under Neuromyelitis Optica). 11 Infection. The role of viral infections in the initiation and maintenance of MS has been debated for some time. Several viral infections are known to cause demyelination in animals, including visna virus of goats and sheep, canine distemper virus, and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Viral infections in humans can also cause demyelination (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [JC papillomavirus], subacute sclerosing panencephalitis [measles virus], and human T-cell lymphotropic or leukemia virus type 1 [HTLV-1]-associated myelopathy). The epidemiology of MS suggests that environmental factors may promote the disease state, possibly due to one or more viruses. A virus may be involved in the pathogenesis of MS in several ways:",

Virus has rarely been cultured from CSF of MS patients, but a new strain of HSV (the MS strain) and a new virus (Inoue-Melnick virus) were first isolated from the CSF of MS patients. 12, 13 Newer molecular techniques to search for a viral genome in CSF and brain have rejected the claim that HTLV-1 is associated with MS. The finding that human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), although present in 70% of brains from both control subjects and MS patients, is localized to the oligodendrocyte nuclei near plaques of MS patients and to oligodendrocyte cytoplasm in control subjects indicates that persistent CNS viral infection is common. 14 This raises the possibility that MS may depend on an aberrant host response to this normal condition or that a defective virus that lacks the ability to evade immune detection may be to blame.",

In pattern I, cellular mechanisms of injury seem to prevail (macrophages and T-lymphocytes) whereas in pattern II humoral mechanisms of injury predominate (e.g., antibody and complement-mediated mechanisms). Patterns III and IV are related to oligondendrocye pathology: in pattern III, a distal oligdendrogliopathy and apoptosis have been reported, whereas in pattern IV, primary oligodendrogliopathy and degeneration of oligodendrocytes have been described. Currently these subtypes can be diagnosed only by biopsy; serum and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers are not yet known, although lesional T2 hypointense rims and response to plasma exchange may correlate well with pattern II pathology. It is important to note that the patterns do not correlate with clinical subtypes of MS, with the exception of pattern IV, which has been identified only in primary progressive (PPMS) patients. Evidence to date suggests that the pattern of lesion formation remains the same within an individual patient; patients do not \"switch\" from one pattern to the other.

Diffuse inflammation was also found throughout the white matter of the progressive cases, associated with activation of microglia. No significant correlation was shown between focal white matter lesion load and cortical demyelination. This study defines three crucially important pathological hallmarks of MS-focal demyelinated white matter lesions, diffuse injury in the white matter, and cortical plaque formation-and concludes that white matter lesion formation predominates in active forms of MS, while cortical pathology and diffuse white matter injury characterizes the progressive forms. The authors of this landmark paper also established that these three processes are potentially independent of each other.",

The only definitive genetic association in MS is with the serologically defined human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR15, DQ6. This is one of the DR2 haplotypes, also known as Dw2 in cellular terminology and DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602 in molecular nomenclature. Though its link to MS is well established, the risk conferred by this haplotype is small (relative risk of 3 to 4), and it is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of MS. Linkage to this locus has not been proved, indicating that it plays only a minor role in familial susceptibility. Other susceptibility genes likely contribute, possibly the T-cell receptor variable b region and the IgG heavy-chain variable region (especially the VH2-5 gene). But their specific roles have not been established. Other genes under study have been the MBP coding gene, the CTLA-4 gene on chromosome 2q33, and the interleukin-1ra associated gene, in concurrence with the HLA-DR15 haplotype. Mitochondrial mutations are also under investigation, and an LHON-associated mtDNA mutation may be an important cofactor in developing MS in some patients. The ApoE4 gene, as in Alzheimer's disease, has been associated with a higher incidence of MS. On the other hand, ApoE3 is considered to have neurotropic, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant properties. These findings are yet to be confirmed by larger studies.",

            "text": "EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS. MS is not a rare disease. It affects millions worldwide and approximately 400,000 in the United States alone. Symptoms usually begin during young adulthood, with the peak onset at age 24. Approximately 0.3% of MS cases are diagnosed before age 15. Women are affected nearly twice as often as men. MS has a predilection for whites, especially those of northern European heritage. Other races and ethnic populations are resistant to a variable extent. MS is virtually unknown among black Africans but occurs in African-Americans at half the rate of whites, possibly due to racial admixture or environmental factors. MS is rare in tropical areas, and the prevalence increases proportionally to the distance from the equator, excluding polar regions. The prevalence is less than 5 cases per 100,000 in tropical areas; in high prevalence areas it can be higher than 30 per 100,000, 22 reaching up to 100 per 100,000 in selected areas. Although usually interpreted as the effect of environmental factors, the prevalence gradient is at least partially due to racial susceptibility. 23 Perhaps the most incriminating evidence for the role of environmental factors in the development of MS is the changing risk with migration and the occurrence of MS clusters and epidemics. Immigrant populations tend to acquire the MS risk inherent to their new place of residence. Migration from high to low prevalence before the age of 15 lowers the MS risk, whereas migration after this age does not affect risk. 18 Migration from low to high prevalence areas increases the risk of MS, but the effect of age is less clear. Many clusters of MS have been reported. 24, 25 The occurrences of MS epidemics in Iceland and the Faroe Islands have been proposed to be the result of exposure to a pathogen brought by British troops during their occupation in World War II. Other environmental factors associated with the development of MS include cigarette smoking (odds ratio of 1.81, CI: 1.1-2.9), animal fat intake, and deficiency of vitamin D. 26, 27 Epidemiological data support the view that MS is caused or triggered by an environmental factor in persons who are genetically susceptible. The familial frequency and distribution implies that several genes contribute to susceptibility, and this is consistent with the low relative risk conferred by the genetic loci studied so far. Data from clusters, migration studies, and family studies reveal that there is a latent period of some 20 years between exposure to the environmental factor and the development of clinical symptoms and that the age at exposure is around 15, the putative age at acquisition.",

These symptoms may occur in practically any distribution: one or more limbs, part of a limb, trunk, face, or combinations. The more distinctive sensory relapses of MS consist of the sensory cord syndrome and the sensory useless hand syndrome. A common scenario is that of numbness or tingling beginning in one foot, ascending first ipsilaterally and then contralaterally. The sensory symptoms may ascend to the trunk, producing a sensory level, or may involve the upper extremities. Associated symptoms commonly include poor balance, weakness, urinary urgency, constipation, and Lhermitte's sign (see later). Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome may occur with sensory disassociation and hemiparesis. The sensory cord syndrome reflects an evolving demyelinating lesion that begins in the medial posterior column ipsilateral to the first symptoms. Sensory cord syndromes are common in MS and suggest the diagnosis when they occur in young persons and remit spontaneously or in response to corticosteroids. Patients with the sensory useless hand may note subjective numbness and lose discriminatory and proprioceptive function, resulting in difficulty writing, typing, buttoning clothes, and holding onto objects, especially when not looking at the hand. This problem can occur bilaterally even without lower extremity symptoms. The responsible lesion is in the lemniscal pathways either in the cervical spinal cord or in the brain stem.

            "text": "MS symptoms may fluctuate in a predictable fashion. Transient worsening of symptoms frequently follows exercise or elevation of body temperature. One example is Uhtoff's phenomenon, in which visual blurring occurs during strenuous activity or with passive exposure to heat. These episodes resolve when the body temperature cools to normal or after a period of rest. An intercurrent infection with fever can induce worsening of symptoms and may be confused with a relapse. Heat sensitivity is presumably related to conduction block, as demyelinated axons are more prone to failed conduction than normal, myelinated fibers. 32 Paroxysmal symptoms are characteristic of MS and are believed to be due to the lateral spread of excitation (ephaptic transmission) between denuded axons in areas of demyelination. Symptoms are typically brief (seconds to 2 minutes) and recur frequently, occasionally dozens of times per day. They may be precipitated by hyperventilation, certain sensory input, or particular postures. Tonic spasms (paroxysmal dystonia) most often affect the arm and leg on one side, but the face, one limb, or bilateral limbs are sometimes involved (Video 20, Tonic Spasms). These spasms may result from lesions anywhere along the corticospinal tract. They often begin during the recovery phase after an acute relapse and remit after a few months. Intense pain and ipsilateral or crossed sensory symptoms may accompany them. Paroxysmal weakness occurs, but it is uncommon. A wide variety of paroxysmal sensory symptoms may occur with MS, including tingling, prickling, burning, or itching, and sharp neuralgic pain is common. Trigeminal neuralgia may appear in patients with MS (Video 106, Trigeminal Neuralgia). The occurrence of trigeminal neuralgia in a person younger than age 40 is suggestive of MS. Lhermitte's sign (transient sensory symptoms usually precipitated by neck flexion) is usually described as an electrical or tingling sensation that travels down the spine or into the extremities. Although quite common in MS, Lhermitte's sign can also occur with a wide variety of other disorders, such as vitamin B 12 deficiency, spondylosis, Chiari malformation, and tumors, and after cisplatin chemotherapy. Several other paroxysmal symptoms are occasionally encountered, including paroxysmal dysarthria and ataxia, paroxysmal diplopia, and combinations of these symptoms. Facial myokymia and hemifacial spasm are additional transient (lasting months) phenomena sometimes due to brain stem demyelination (Video 110, Facial Myokymia; Video 224, Hemifacial Spasm). Trismus, kinesigenic dystonia, paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis, and segmental myoclonus have also been described in case reports of MS patients as rare and unusual examination findings.",

Cortical and juxtacortical lesions may be responsible for the increased incidence of seizures in MS patients. However, such plaques are common and seizures in MS are not, which suggests that other factors may also contribute to the relationship between epilepsy and MS. Focal motor seizures, possibly with secondary generalization, are the most frequent. The occurrence of seizures usually follows one of two patterns. On occasion, focal onset seizures begin early in the course of MS and later remit. The start of seizures late in the course of MS more often poses a chronic problem and may be difficult to control.",

            "text": "Multifocal CNS involvement and acute relapses, remissions, and slow progression of neurological deficits typify MS. A single episode of neurological dysfunction can be suggestive of MS if it follows the typical time course of a relapse: progression over less than 2 weeks (usually days), with or without a period of stabilization, and improvement or resolution (often over months). Insidious progression of deficits localized to a single site in the CNS can also be due to MS, but other causes must be excluded. The temporal course of MS can be described by one of four categories: relapsing-remitting (RR), secondary progressive (SP), primary progressive (PP), and progressive relapsing (PR). 32 Many physicians use the term relapsing progressive, which encompassed patients with SPMS, PRMS, and even those with RRMS who have stepwise relapse-related worsening disability. This term has recently been abandoned. Other terms that relate to the course of MS but have no consensus regarding their definition are sometimes encountered. Benign MS generally refers to patients who have had MS for a long time but have little or no disability. Malignant MS is sometimes used to describe patients with frequent relapses and incomplete recovery but is also used in reference to patients with acute fulminant demyelinating syndromes (see later). The term clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) refers to patients presenting with their first episode of region-restricted episodes of CNS inflammatory demyelination. This may remain an isolated syndrome (no recurrence), it may remain a forme fruste of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), or it may be the harbinger for one of the relapsing forms of MS. The probability of recurrent demyelinating episodes (e.g., clinically definite MS) has been the subject of several important investigations, and several clinical features and test results are of predictive value. Optic nerve, spinal cord, and brain stem are the most common sites of these recurrent monosymptomatic events, and the time profile follows that of MS relapses. The pathogenesis, pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical features, associated disorders, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management are the same as in MS.",

Profound visual loss, recurrent ON, and age older than 35 are associated with a higher risk for poor recovery. Investigators have concluded that recurrent multifocal demyelinating episodes, fulfilling the diagnostic requirements of clinically definite MS, develop in 50% or more of patients after isolated ON when follow-up is extended beyond 20 years. 36 Most of this risk is incurred within the first few years, although significant risk may continue into the fourth decade after the event. Children much more often develop simultaneous bilateral ON and have a lower risk for subsequent MS than adults. Factors that are associated with an increased risk of developing MS as a disseminated illness are the presence of venous sheathing, recurrent ON, family history of MS, white race, previous vague or nonspecific neurological symptoms, and the presence of oligoclonal bands (OCBs), elevated IgG index, or IgG synthesis rate in CSF. The severity of acute transverse myelitis is inversely related to the risk of acquiring further symptomatic demyelinating lesions. Complete transverse myelitis with profound loss of motor, sensory, and sphincter function imparts a relatively low risk of 3 to 14 for the later diagnosis of MS. Partial transverse myelitis with preservation of significant motor function at peak is associated with a much higher incidence of MS. Although monosymptomatic brain stem demyelination is not as common as either ON or acute transverse myelitis, similar conclusions have been reached. In the only study available, two thirds of these patients with cerebral white matter lesions detected on MRI developed MS within 5 years, compared with none of 5 patients with normal head MRI. 37, 38 A recently published 10-year follow-up of the original Queen Square series continues to demonstrate the value of the baseline cranial MRI study in determining risk of recurrence (MS risk). In this cohort study of 81 CIS patients, approximately two thirds had at least one asymptomatic lesion (54 of 81, 67%) at baseline. After 5 years of follow-up, slightly more than half with one to three asymptomatic baseline cerebral lesions had developed MS (13 of 24) compared with the majority of cases presenting with at least four baseline lesions (28 of 33, 85%). After 10 years of follow-up, the majority of patients with any asymptomatic cerebral lesions had developed definite MS (45 of 54, 83%). 39 The recently published 14-year follow-up data on this group of patients reveals that 88% of the initially MRI positive patients developed MS versus 19% of the MRI negative subgroup. 40 This information is helpful for treating patients in the setting of CIS.",

Metastatic tumors and multifocal gliomas are often cited examples, but rarely is this distinction difficult for an experienced clinician. Lymphoma more commonly masquerades as MS because the lesions may involve the white matter, may be multifocal, and are corticosteroid responsive. In addition, demyelination sometimes presents as one (or a few) mass lesion(s). In this situation, biopsy may be needed for diagnosis. Neoplasms can cause paraneoplastic syndromes that may be confused with MS. A high index of suspicion must be kept for older age at presentation, subacute ataxia, early dementia, and personality changes. A few metabolic disorders may resemble MS, such as vitamin B 12 deficiency, vitamin E deficiency (seen in Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome, hypobetalipoproteinemia, and Refsum's disease), and central pontine or extrapontine myelinolysis (Video 113, Pontine Myelinolysis). Leukodystrophies are usually not difficult to distinguish from MS. Krabbe's disease (galactocerebroside-b-galactosidase deficiency), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD; arylsulfatase A deficiency), and the usual adult form of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) exhibit both central and peripheral dysmyelination. Blood leukocyte or fibroblast culture enzyme activity levels will confirm the diagnosis of Krabbe's disease and MLD, and elevated levels of very long chain fatty acids occur in ALD/AMN. Mitochondrial disorders should also be given consideration because symptoms and MRI appearance may be similar to MS. A relapsing remitting disorder identical to MS is sometimes seen in patients with the mutations responsible for Leber's hereditary optic neuritis (LHON). 41 This usually occurs in female patients, and there may not be a family history of visual loss. A number of rare biochemically defined illnesses and other genetic disorders may occasionally merit consideration (including cobalamin and folate dysmetabolism, adult polyglucosan body disease, hereditary spastic paraparesis, spinocerebellar degeneration, and hereditary cerebroretinal vasculopathy). 42 Several additional disorders must be excluded before diagnosing primary progressive MS (PPMS). Spinal cord compression from spondylosis or tumor may produce chronic progressive myelopathy. Chiari malformations, syringomyelia, syringobulbia, other foramen magnum lesions, spinal arteriovenous malformations, and dural fistulas may also need consideration. Careful imaging readily identifies these structural abnormalities. Degenerative diseases such as olivopontocerebellar atrophy may mimic PPMS.

FLAIR imaging is especially helpful for evaluating periventricular lesions that may go unnoticed on regular T2-weighted scans. The disadvantage of the technique is its relative insensitivity to posterior fossa lesions. Proton density weighted images are also part of the usual sets of images used in the MR diagnostics of MS. These images can be evaluated similarly to T2-weighted images. Technically, they are usually acquired together with the T2-weighted datasets, as a first echo in conventional fast spin echo sequences, where the subsequent echoes can be used for generating the T2-weighted images. New T2weighted lesions have a fuzzy border and enlarge over a few weeks. After a period of stabilization, the T2-weighted lesion regresses and becomes more sharply delineated from the surrounding white matter as edema resolves. Most of the time, a residual abnormality with increased T2 weighting and decreased T1-weighted signal remains, reflecting demyelination and gliosis. The low attenuation T1 signal, or \"T1 black hole,\" is more often seen in secondary progressive MS and is thought to represent actual tissue loss. In several well-documented cases, hypointense lesions on T2-weighted scans were described in subcortical gray matter structures in MS patients. On a molecular level these areas are thought to represent iron deposition; their significance in MS is not fully understood. The MRI activity of disease, defined as either the number of new, recurrent, and enlarging lesions or the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions, is usually higher than the clinical activity. This may be either because of the involvement of asymptomatic areas of the CNS or because of a pathophysiological difference between symptomatic and nonsymptomatic lesions based on the presence or absence of axonal dysfunction.",

            "text": "There is only poor correlation between disability and lesion load (volume of white matter abnormalities) determined by head MRI. Sometimes individuals have severe impairment and few MRI abnormalities, and the converse may occur. This disparity is partially explained by variable spinal cord involvement, but a pathophysiological difference may account for some of the discrepancy. Several MRI markers of gray matter involvement correlate better than measures of white matter pathology with clinical functional outcome measures in MS. In a recent study 47 EDSS showed the strongest correlation with gray matter volume loss and with T1 black hole volume increase (p < 0.01); both are considered to reflect neuronal and axonal pathology. Ambulatory function, assessed as the 25-feet timed walk, also correlated well with gray matter volume loss and T1 black hole volume. On normal appearing gray matter magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) histograms, normalized peak heights inversely correlated with EDSS in 18 RRMS patients (r \u00bc \u00c00.65, p \u00bc.01). 48 In a study evaluating a number of MRI parameters (including brain T1-hypointense and FLAIR-hyperintense lesion volume, third ventricle width, brain parenchymal fraction and T2 hypointensities in the dentate nucleus), the best correlation with EDSS (and the only correlating parameter with 25-feet timed walk) was T2 hypointensity in the dentate nucleus. 49 In 41 MS patients, an MRI study concluded that gray matter atrophy correlated with clinical status (EDSS, 25-feet timed walking and disease duration). 47 A study of patients with PPMS and RRMS showed that neocortical volume as determined by MRI correlated with EDSS scores across all the patients, but the strength of the correlation was stronger (p < 0.05) in the PPMS (r \u00bc \u00c00.64, p < 0.0001) than in the RRMS group (r \u00bc \u00c00.27, p \u00bc 0.04). 50 MR spectroscopy is increasingly becoming an accepted diagnostic modality, where information can be obtained about the biochemical constituents of selected voxels of interest. With this technique, a cubic volume of interest is defined based on a regular MR image set. Simultaneous acquisition of multiple volume units is possible. With long echo time (TE) studies, NAA (N-acetylaspartate), choline, creatinine, and lactate peaks can be identified on the MR spectrum. With short TE studies, myoinositol, lipids, and some neurotransmitters may be identified. The resolution of the MR spectrum (the \"number of lines\" in the spectrum) is proportionate to the magnetic field strength used. NAA is the second most abundant amino acid constituent in the brain after glutamate. It is localized almost exclusively in neurons and axons. Creatinine is used as the \"constant\" peak in a MR spectrum, since it is the least likely to be altered by CNS-specific processes. Therefore, numeric MRS data are usually presented as ratios related to creatinine. The NAA/creatinine ratio is decreased in areas of axonal or neuronal loss. It correlates well with disability. It can be decreased in normal appearing white matter, also in early stages of lesion formation, thus representing a challenge to the usual dogma of axonal loss being secondary to myelin damage. The decrease of the NAA/creatinine ratio may return to normal following the resolution of the acute phase. This process may be related either to reversibility of neuronal injury or to disappearance of edema in the involved areas. In general, more reduced NAA peaks are seen in progressive forms of MS with more profound tissue loss. If a relatively large hemispheric lesion shows decreased NAA content, similar findings may be seen in the other hemisphere in a \"mirror\" location. The lactate peak can be elevated in a variety of acute processes, and as such, carries relatively low specificity. The short TE spectrum is used less frequently; the \"mobile lipid\" peak (which is thought to represent macromolecular protein fragments) is increased in areas of acute demyelination.",

            "text": "Another newer MRI technique used in MS research is magnetization transfer imaging. The principle behind this imaging modality is relatively simple. In complex macromolecular systems, there is a baseline magnetization exchange in equilibrium between macromolecular protons and mobile protons. If the macromolecular protons are saturated before each excitation (and subsequent data acquisition) with a prolonged off-resonance broadband pulse, then the signal intensity of the image will be reduced owing to magnetization transfer exchange between the saturated (\"bound\") and free (\"mobile\") protons. By obtaining duplicate sets of images (with and without magnetization transfer pulse), a magnetization transfer ratio can be calculated. The ratio reflects the integrity of the macromolecular environment. It is reduced by approximately 3% to 5% in areas of edema, but it is more significantly reduced in areas of demyelination or axonal loss. If the ratio \"normalizes\" in a lesion, no subsequent tissue loss is usually seen on other imaging modalities. Despite these advantages, the magnetization transfer imaging is technically difficult because it produces variable findings depending on the technical environment and is not universally available. It has not become an accepted and standard technique for evaluation of MS patients. It may be very useful as a marker for remyelination and tissue repair in future neuroprotective or tissue restorative trials.",

A lymphocytic pleocytosis occurs during acute exacerbations in about one third of patients, but this seldom exceeds 50 cells. Eighty percent of the lymphocytes are CD3 positive. The ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells is 2:1. Less than 20% of the cells are B cells. CSF protein is normal in up to 60%; levels above 100 mg/dL are unusual and may suggest a different disorder. The proportion of g globulin is high owing to the synthesis of immunoglobulins within the blood-brain barrier. The majority of CSF immunoglobulin is IgG, although IgM and IgA may also be elevated. Measures of intrathecal IgG production have been devised that are more useful than simple g-globulin levels. The IgG index and synthesis rate are elevated in 70% to 90% of CDMS patients and occasionally in other disorders. Agarose gel electrophoresis, or the more sensitive isoelectric focusing of CSF proteins, often reveals discrete bands of immunoglobulin, each a monoclonal antibody. It is pertinent to compare serum and CSF banding patterns because peripheral monoclonal gammopathies may produce CSF bands. To reduce false-positive results, only unique CSF OCBs should be reported. Between 85% and 95% of clinically definite MS patients have OCBs; however, early in the course they are not as prevalent. Once present, OCBs persist and the pattern does not vary, although new bands occasionally appear. Unlike subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, in which the majority of OCBs are antibodies specific for measles virus, the antigenic specificity of OCBs in MS is unknown; they are unlikely to be pathogen specific or autoantigen directed; there is some evidence that they may be genetically determined germline antibodies. Five percent to 10% of noninflammatory CNS samples and 30% of inflammatory samples are also positive for OCBs. 51 More detailed recommendations about the inclusion of CSF parameters to the diagnosis of MS were recently published 52 suggesting that the cell count and differential should be completed within 2 hours. The new and recommended method for the detection of OCBs includes immunoelectophorsesis on agarose gel followed by immunoblotting. The reported sensitivity of this technique is above 95%, with a specificity of 86% to 87%. In other inflammatory or infectious illnesses, OCBs are often transient features. Their persistence is more suggestive of MS. The presence of myelin components, antimyelin antibodies, and kappa light chains in CSF has also been used in the diagnosis of MS. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these products is less than that of OCBs.",

Scans that \"look like\" MS (and meet the criteria of Barkhof and Tintore) but have never been accompanied by an obvious and documented neurological examination finding do not fulfill the McDonald Criteria. There was some sympathy among the International Panel members revising the McDonald Criteria to allow selected symptoms that are clearly and specifically enunciated by the patient (e.g., Lhermitte's symptom, trigeminal neuralgia, numbness ascending to the waist or higher) coupled with objective paraclinical (such as imaging and CSF) findings to be sufficient as an indicator of a prior or current attack needed for an MS diagnosis. However, the panel was reluctant to endorse the diagnosis of MS in the absence of any objective clinical findings, even if objective paraclinical findings are in place, at least until such a scheme is tested in prospective settings. Patients with imaging and CSF findings suggestive of MS but not showing any objective evidence for neurological deficits commonly seen in MS require careful clinical and radiological monitoring.

In keeping with the definition that clinical relapses must be separated by at least 1 month, it was agreed that new T2 lesions on MRI should occur at least 30 days after disease onset. This means that any new T2 lesion occurring at any time point after a so-called reference scan performed at least 30 days after the onset of the initial clinical event is useful in meeting imaging diagnostic criteria for dissemination in time. It should be noted though that a new T2 lesion must be of sufficient size and location to exclude lesions that could have been missed previously for technical reasons of slice orientation, thickness or spacing, tissue contrast, patient motion, or other artifacts. This requires standardized scanning procedures with emphasis on careful repositioning, as well as input from qualified evaluators experienced in MS imaging. With the new revision, there are two ways to show dissemination in time using imaging: (1) detection of gadolinium enhancement at least 3 months after the onset of initial clinical event, if not at the site corresponding to the initial event; or (2) detection of a new T2 lesion if this appears at any time compared with a reference scan done at least 30 days after onset of the initial clinical event.",

For dissemination in space, a spinal cord lesion is equivalent to, and can substitute for, a brain infratentorial lesion, but not for a periventricular or juxtacortical lesion. An enhancing spinal cord lesion is equivalent to an enhancing brain lesion, and an enhancing spinal cord lesion can \"count\" doubly in fulfilling the criteria (e.g., a single enhancing spinal cord lesion can \"count\" for an enhancing lesion and an infratentorial lesion). Individual cord lesions can contribute together with individual brain lesions to reach the required nine T2 lesions to satisfy the Barkhof-Tintore criteria (the MRI criteria incorporated in the original McDonald's criteria). The panel recognized that diffuse cord changes may occur in MS, especially in the progressive forms; however, these changes are not sufficiently reliable to allow for their incorporation into the diagnostic criteria at this time. Repeat spinal cord imaging in patients without new symptoms of myelitis has a low yield in efforts to demonstrate dissemination of lesions in time. In other words, while it is common to see asymptomatic new brain lesions on repeated scans, new cord lesions generally do result in new neurological symptoms.

VEP and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) may detect subclinical sites of demyelination, thus providing evidence of multifocality. Brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) are occasionally informative. More than 90% of persons with a history of ON have an abnormal VEP, and 85% of CDMS patients have abnormalities on VEPs even when the history of ON is absent. Slowed conduction is present on SSEP in nearly three fourths of patients with CDMS. BAEs are the least sensitive, with abnormalities in less than 50%. MRI has largely supplanted the use of evoked potentials in MS because of the greater sensitivity in the diagnosis and the detailed anatomical information it provides. In 2001, the American Academy of Neurology released practice parameters regarding the usefulness of evoked potential studies in MS. According to these recommendations, VEPs are considered probably useful (class II evidence) to identify patients at increased risk for developing clinically definite MS. SSEPs are possibly useful, whereas the evidence for BAEPs supporting the diagnosis of CDMS is insufficient.",

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was shown to speed recovery from an exacerbation but had no effect on the ultimate degree of recovery. Because of the unpredictable cortisone response to ACTH, oral prednisone and later intravenous methylprednisolone became the preferred treatments. The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial verified that intravenous methylprednisolone but not prednisone increased the recovery rate and unexpectedly increased the time to the next relapse, thus delaying the diagnosis of CDMS. 54 Moreover, the prednisone-treated group had twice as many recurrences. The finding was not replicated in a second study, but it has affected the practice of treating acute MS exacerbations. The current recommendation is to treat disabling attacks with 500 to 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone per day for 3 to 5 days with or without a short tapering dose of oral corticosteroids. According to the practice parameters for steroid treatment of acute ON attacks released by the American Academy of Neurology in 2001, oral prednisone in doses of 1 mg/kg/day has no proven value. Higher dose of oral or parenteral methylprednisolone may result in quicker and more thorough recovery of visual function. There is no evidence of long-term benefit for visual function.",

A trial of seven PLEX treatments (alternate days) is a reasonable option for patients who fail to respond to conventional IV methylprednisolone therapy in acute, severe episodes of demyelinating diseases. The response to PLEX is stongly associated with the histological MS subtype. 59 Antibody and complement plays a crucial role in pattern II lesion formation. In a study of 19 biopsy-proven MS cases by Keegan and associates, 10 pattern II cases showed good response to PLEX, whereas 9 cases of pattern I or III did not respond at all to PLEX. Neuromyelitis optica, which is now considered an antibody-mediated condition with a known serological marker, also shows good response to PLEX: in a study by the Mayo group, 60% of NMO patients showed moderate or marked improvement to PLEX, and an additional 10% showed mild improvement. 60 Alteration of the Natural Course. The primary goal of drug treatment is to alter the natural course of the disease (e.g., reducing the frequency and severity of relapses, preventing the chronic progressive phase, and slowing the progression of disability). The disease activity seen on MRI is often used as a secondary outcome, although MRI measures currently correlate imperfectly with clinical outcome. Knowledge on altering the course of MS is largely restricted to three patient groups, those with clinically isolated syndromes, those with RRMS, and those with secondary progressive MS.",

The duration of follow-up in this study (71% 1 year, 34% 2 years, 16% 3 years) is insufficient to determine long-term benefit from early intervention, however. It is also clear that the treatment is only partially effective, as 50% of interferon (IFN)-treated patients in the CHAMPS trial had clinical or MRI evidence of recurrent disease within 18 months of starting treatment. 62 The analysis of treatment effect related to the CHAMPS trial reveal a RRR of 38%, an ARR of 14.6%, and an NNT of 7 patients over 2 years to prevent one conversion to \"clinically definite MS.\"",

One particularly disturbing result was the production of neutralizing autoantibodies (NAbs) in 38% of patients after 3 years of treatment. Not only do patients with these antibodies thereafter fail to respond to this drug, but there is also a concern that NAbs may cross-react with natural interferon-b and interfere with its function. All positive sera for NAbs seem to cross-react with both interferon-b 1a and 1b. Switching from one preparation to the other does not change the pattern of antibody response. 65 The long-term effects of NAbs are unknown. Recent studies seem to support that NAb formation reduces clinical and MRI effects although often NAb formation subsides with time. There are no firm guidelines for monitoring NAb formation. Most physicians do not measure NAbs but rather change therapies empirically when patients appear to be failing treatment. Low titer Nabs may be just transient phenomenon related to IFN treatment; persistent high titer NAbs on two consecutive tests at least 6 months apart is likely associated with poor treatment response to INF.",

Once-weekly intramuscular interferon-b 1a has been found to have effects similar to that of interferon-b 1b in reducing the frequency of MS relapses. In addition, a favorable effect on disability was also demonstrated and side effects were less common. In the original interferon-b 1-a intramuscular trial, the primary outcome measure was time to EDSS progression. The RRR was 37%, the ARR was 13%, and the NNT was 8 for 2 years to prevent one patient from developing EDSS progression. The calculations for \"proportion relapse free\" show an RRR of 16%, and ARR of 12%, and an NNT of 8 over 2 years (8 patients need to be treated for 2 years to increase the number of patients who were relapse free by one). NAbs occurred half as often as with interferon-b 1b. Interferon-b 1a has been approved by the FDA for treatment of \"relapsing MS.\" 66 The \"correct\" dose of interferon continues to be debated. In a recent placebo-controlled trial, patients randomized to a high dose of interferon-b 1a (44 mg three times per week) did better than those receiving half this weekly dose. Both groups outperformed placebo and the high dose seemed to have more effect on relapse severity, hospitalizations, MRI activity, and lesion volume accumulation, and possibly on delaying disability in the most severely disabled patients. At the end of the 2 years of follow-up, placebo-treated patients were randomized to 22 or 44 mg subcutaneously three times weekly; patients on active treatment were continued on their original dose. 67 The authors reported a benefit for the higher dose and for those treated for the full 4 years, again suggesting that early treatment and perhaps higher doses of interferons may be beneficial. The primary outcome, however, was relapse count per patient per 4 years and, as such, patients treated early had a significant advantage using this outcome measure. There were trends favoring the higher dose (relapse rate, MRI volumes; not for time to first confirmed progression, however). The authors did not make statistical adjustments for multiple comparisons and there were many dropouts in the high-dose groups, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Again, the answer to the question about the benefit of early treatment can best come from long-term (perhaps 8 to 10 years) studies using \"hard outcomes\" (e.g., time to progression, major milestones in disability). The EBM calculations based on the \"proportion relapse free\" data for the original interferon-b 1a (Rebif) study show an RRR of 19%, and ARR of 16%, and an NNT of 6 over 2 years to increase the number of relapse free by one. Relative treatment advantages of interferon-b 1a and 1b have not been clearly established but are under study. 68, 69 A pilot study in RRMS patients suggests that interferon-a may also have a therapeutic effect. 70 A study of interferon responders showed that younger patients with frequent relapses, and higher EDSS scores upon entry may be associated better response. 71 Laboratory Monitoring of Interferon Products. It is important to note that even though the interferon products are generally safe to use, they can be associated with potentially harmful adverse reactions. We recommend that every newly starting patient should have a baseline complete blood count, liver function tests, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test. The liver function tests and blood count studies should be repeated in 1 week, 1 month, and every 3 months thereafter; the TSH should be repeated every 6 to 12 months.",

After a preliminary study suggested efficacy, 72 a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial showed a 29% reduction in relapse rate. 73 The FDA has approved this medication for use in RRMS. Even though this disease-modifying therapy requires daily subcutaneous administration, the side effects are relatively minor compared to the interferons, and patients do not need regular laboratory monitoring (Table 48- lesions, lesion volumes, and the percentage of new lesions that will evolve into T1 \"black holes,\" although the MRI effect may be less pronounced compared to the interferon products, and is not apparent until the agent has been used for at least 6 months. [74] [75] [76] The EBM calculations for GA using the \"proportion relapse free\" data show an RRR of 10%, ARR of 7%, and an NNT of 14 over 2 years to increase the number of relapse free by one. Combined Azathioprine and Interferon-b 1b. A small trial at NIH showed significant reduction in the number of contrast-enhancing lesions when azathioprine in an average maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg/day was added to interferon-b 1b in a study of six RRMS patients followed for a median period of 15 months. The addition of azathioprine may be considered in \"treatment failure\" cases, but this study was hampered by the small number of patients, no control subjects, and no blinding. 77 Intravenous Immunoglobulin. Monthly treatment with low-dose (0.15 to 0.2 g/kg) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in RRMS patients resulted in fewer and less severe relapses in addition to slowing the accumulation of disability in a single randomized trial. The outcome was similar to that of injectable interferons. 78 This therapy is less accepted in the United States. More studies with larger number of patients and extended follow-up are needed to confirm these limited observations. Recent studies have failed to demonstrate that IVIG administration reverses long-standing deficits from MS and ON. [79] [80] [81] IVIG was also recently studied in acute ON and failed to demonstrate benefit on any of the outcome measures. 82 Natalizumab. In late 2004, natalizumab was approved for the treatment of RRMS. 83 Natalizumab is a humanized a-4 integrin antibody that inhibits the migration of all leukocytes (except for neutrophils) to target organs. A phase 2 study established 84 that a 300-mg monthly dose reduced the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions by 90% and the clinical relapse rate by over 50% compared to placebo. This study was followed by the AFFIRM and SENTINEL phase III studies. The AFFIRM study enrolled over 900 patients with RRMS; none of them had been on other approved immunomodulators for longer than 6 months. The annualized relapse rate at 1 year was reduced from 0.74 in the placebo group to 0.25 in the treated group (66% relative reduction, p < 0.0001). The proportion of relapse-free patients was 76% in the treated group, 53% in the placebo group. The number of enhancing lesions was reduced by 92%, and the number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions was reduced by 80%. The proportion of patients without clinical and MRI activity was 46% in the natalizumab group, and 14% in the placebo group. In the SENTINEL trial, the combination of intramuscular interferon-b 1a and natalizumab was studied against IM interferon-b 1a and placebo in patients who had demonstrated an incomplete response (relapse suppression) to interferon therapy. The EBM calculations of the AFFIRM data based on proportion with relapses suggests an RRR of 49%, an ARR of 23%, and an NNT of 4 over 1 year to increase the proportion of relapse free by one. The SENTI-NEL data shows an RRR of 31%, an ARR of 17%, and an NNT of 6 over 1 year to increase the proportion relapse free.",

Based on these data, the FDA granted expedited approval of natalizumab on November 23, 2004. On February 28, 2005 , the medication was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by the sponsor (Biogen-Elan) after two cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in the SENTINEL study cohort. 85 Both patients were in the combined interferon and natalizumab arm. A third PML case was later identified from one of the phase III inflammatory bowel trials of this agent. At the time of writing this manuscript, natalizumab is still off the market. The natalizumab story has received significant media attention. Several consequences can be drawn from this failure. First, highly potent immunomodulators like natalizumab are best used by specialists in selected cases. A large number of prescriptions were written for natalizumab during its short 3 months on the market, including prescriptions by general practitioners. Widespread use of such medication in relatively stable cases of MS is not indicated. Second, the combination of potent immunomodulators may result in unpredictable adverse outcomes. Many MS experts anticipate that in the future MS therapies will need to be administered in combination to optimize therapeutic benefit. However, the exact effect of such combinations on the highly complex immune system is difficult if not impossible to predict. Furthermore, our inability to treat MS more effectively does not stem from the fact that we can not provide powerful immunosuppression, as evidenced by the autologous bone marrow transplantation studies. MS is a complex disease with a prominent inflammatory component; however, increasing evidence suggests that the neurodegenerative component of this illness may be independent of the inflammatory component, and is just as important, if not more important, from the standpoint of long-term disability. Third, in chronic diseases such as MS, a short 1-year trial, no matter how convincing the outcome may be, should not be considered sufficient to approve a medication, which will then be used in tens of thousands of patients on a \"lifelong\" basis. There clearly is a need for new and more effective medications for treating MS; however, clinical trials in chronic conditions are very difficult to sustain. To overcome this, many MS trials use primary MRI outcome measures, since inflammation and new lesion formation-related MRI markers respond more immediately to treatment; however, these markers do not correlate well with long term disability, as discussed earlier.",

            "text": "Summary of Recommendations for the Treatment of RRMS Patients. When making decisions about starting an MS patients on immunomodulators, several factors must be considered. One must realize that even though there are medications available for relapsing forms of MS, all the currently available therapies are only partially effective, the most reliable data is about short-term relapse rate reduction, and a relapse rate reduction does not necessarily translate into reduction of future disabilities. Natural history data clearly suggest that a subset of MS patients will do very well without treatment (see discussion about the Olmsted County cohort later); this information can be very useful when deciding about treatment in patients with a 5-or 10-year disease history and minimal disability (EDSS 2.0). In this patient group, a careful wait and see approach with appropriate monitoring is acceptable. Counseling of newly diagnosed MS patients is of crucial importance, and it should usually include family members. Most patients have easy access to an abundance of frequently misleading information on the Internet, or from relatives and friends with MS. It is important to realize that every case is different; however, through the rational use of natural history data, clinical and MRI features of the specific case, and the clear understanding of the available clinical trial data, the clinician should be able to provide customized and relevant advice to patients and families. Considering that the treatments are only partially effective, the wishes of an educated patient constitute an important part in the decision-making process. Ultimately, the treatment decisions should remain individualized between the patients and their treating physicians, and the physician's role as an information clearinghouse and educator cannot be overemphasized in this process.",

            "text": "The three interferon products and GA represent the most commonly used MS immunomodulators in the United States; therefore, it is important to draw some practical conclusions about these agents. By now, several class I studies demonstrate that these agents are effective in reducing the relapse rate in RRMS over a 2-to 3-year period; the reduction is roughly 30% with the high-dose interferons and GA. The above-mentioned NNT data are also very useful for the clinician and the well-informed patient when making treatment decisions. There is evidence for a dose-response relationship among the interferon products, mostly from the EVIDENCE and INCOMIN studies. The double dose IM interferon-b 1a study did not show a dose-response relationship; this may be related to the fact that the increased dose was given with the same frequency as the standard dose. The injectable immunomodulators have incomplete evidence for efficacy in disability-based outcome measures. Many of the long-term extension studies suffer from several drawbacks, including open label unblinded design, significant dropout rate, and lack of control subjects; this is especially true for the GA extension data. The currently available few head-to-head comparison studies are also hampered with methodological issues; new comparative studies are under way. Overall, these agents remain partially effective in relapsing forms of MS; their long-term effects on reducing the clinically most important feature of MS-disability-still remains unclear.",

            "text": "Interferons. Interferon-b 1b may have a beneficial effect on the overall outcome of SPMS and may also alter MR lesions, 86, 87 but this question remains incompletely answered. In the placebo-controlled European study 88 of inteferon-b 1b in SPMS, the time to worsening was extended for treated patients. Treated patients were less likely to be wheelchair-bound and had fewer hospitalizations. Another analysis 89 of this study confirmed the benefits, though the dropout rate in this study was relatively high. The patients who responded best to interferon therapy were those who experienced relapses during their disease course. MRI monitoring suggested that the benefit on T2 lesion activity was seen early and persisted into the second half of the second year of treatment. T2 lesion load increased in placebo-but not interferon-treated patients in the first 2 years of treatment. 90 Contrasting with these results, in another trial involving patients with SPMS, 91 both high dose (44 mg) and lower dose (22 mg) interferon-b 1a failed to change the primary outcome of time to disability worsening. Positive effects were seen on relapse rate and reduction of MRI activity, but the effect on disability did not replicate the European interferon-b 1b report. A combined analysis of the American and European trials concluded that continued relapse activity and more rapid progression over the preceding year (by >1 on the EDSS scale) are the best predictors of response. 92 IVIG in Secondary Progressive MS. A recent European trial reported that IVIG did not have a significant impact on clinical and disability related outcome measures. IVIG did reduce the accumulation of brain atrophy in SPMS, but did not reduce the incidence of blood-brain barrier abnormalities. There was no statistically significant change on magnetization transfer MRI measurements; however, a trend for conservation of normal-appearing brain tissue was found. 93 Overall Recommendations for SPMS. In general, as the evidence that interferons alter long-term disability is limited and controversial, we generally do not newly start SPMS patients on interferon products. In a subset of patients still having disabling relapses, interferon therapy may be offered to specifically reduce relapse rate. The data by Confavreux and associates, however, suggest that the EDSS in populations of SPMS patients continues to progress independent of relapses 94 once a \"fixed\" baseline level of moderate disability has been reached. Therefore, while interferons may reduce the relapse rate in SPMS, the rate of progression of disability may not be reduced by these treatments. More usually, SPMS patients are already on an injectable immunomodulator, and the question of whether it is worth continuing the therapy may come up, especially in patients who have a hard time tolerating these medications and feel that the side effects of the medications have a clear negative impact on their overall health. In these cases, we usually allow the patients to stop their medications. Just like in the RRMS cases, however, patient education about SPMS trials and realistic expectations about the treatment is a crucial element in the decision-making process. Understanding the patient's needs and fears and clarifying potential misconceptions constitute a very important role of the treating neurologist. In those patients who continue their interferon therapy, we must continue to follow them for toxicity and disease activity. Please also see the following discussion under mitoxantrone for recommendations on the potential use of that specific agent in SPMS.",

In a review of the literature, Ghalie 97 estimated the risk of mitoxantrone therapyrelated acute leukemia in MS patients at 0.05% to 0.1%; in an international registry of MS patients taking mitoxantrone, the risk of leukemia seems somewhat higher. This therapy has been approved by the FDA for treatment of SPMS, but no peer-reviewed full report of the MIMS study had been published until 4 years after the initial report in an abstracts form. The study 98 showed a treatment effect in RRMS and SPMS patients with \"recent rapid worsening.\" The study had a high dropout rate and a small sample size. Most patients (74%) had relapses in the preceding 2 years, suggesting this cohort mostly includes worsening RRMS or PRMS patients, in whom a positive treatment effect is expected; however, it does not mean that for classic SPMS patients who no longer have relapses the study outcome is applicable, and it is especially not applicable to PPMS cases. The primary outcome measure was a composite score comprised of five clinical measures: change in EDSS at 2 years; change in Ambulation Index at 2 years; change in the baseline standardized neurological status at 2 years; number of relapses requiring corticosteroid treatment; and time to first relapse. Seventy-seven percent completed 24 months of follow-up. At 24 months, benefit was reported in all five components of the composite measure for both active treatment arms, with the overall greatest benefit noted between placebo and the group receiving mitoxantrone at a dose of 12 mg/m 2 . The magnitude of the effect on EDSS was rather modest (mean EDSS change for high-dose mitoxantrone, -0.13 [SD 0.90] versus \u00fe0.23 [SD 1.01] in the placebo group). The MRI results of the MIMS trial were published in 2005 and are frankly disappointing. 99 In a subset of 110 patients (out of 194 in the trial overall), the 12 mg/m 2 dose failed to reach a significant difference from placebo as measured by the primary MRI outcome (total number of scans with gadoliniumenhancing lesions). The 12 mg/m 2 dose reduced the number of T2-weighted lesions at month 24 (p \u00bc 0.027) and showed a trend at month 12 (p \u00bc 0.069). The number of active MR lesions showed a trend toward reduction in the 12 mg/m 2 group only at month 24 (p \u00bc 0.054).",

The antiherpesvirus drug acyclovir has been shown to reduce relapse frequency in a small prospective trial. Total lymphoid irradiation was found to slow the chronic progression of MS, but because this approach precludes the later initiation of immunosuppressant drugs and may be associated with a higher mortality rate, it is not widely used. Cladribine is a nucleoside derivative that was found to decrease relapse rate and slow the progression in patients with SPMS in an initial investigation. 103 The drug is better tolerated than other parenteral immunosuppressants, although bone marrow suppression is a risk. In a more extensive clinical trial, 104 cladribine therapy did not change disability scores, but significant reduction in enhancing lesions and overall T2 lesion burden was observed with higher dose treatment. A study of a small number of patients treated with autologous stem cell transplantation 105 suggested possible clinical stabilization or minor improvement over a 15-month period of follow-up in both secondary and primary progressive MS. The induction chemotherapy (BEAM regimen) resulted in one fatality in this trial; similar incidences are known in patients undergoing this procedure. The small number of patients and the different methods used (some patients received CD34 \u00fe selected graft) makes the interpretation of this data very difficult. Trials with higher number of patients under standardized circumstances are needed to verify the validity of these observations. Symptomatic Treatment of Existing Disabilities Spasticity. Spasticity is common even in patients with only minimal weakness (Video 3, Spastic Gait). It is usually prudent to begin treatment of mild spasticity with a stretching program. A randomized controlled crossover trial 106 of physical therapy (8-week blocks of therapy twice a week, for 45 minutes per session) showed significant benefit on several outcome measures related to improved mobility. No apparent differences were observed between home-based or hospital-based therapy. The addition of an evening dose of benzodiazepine may help relieve extensor spasms and clonus that may interfere with sleep. As spasticity worsens, it becomes necessary to use baclofen. Doses should be escalated slowly to prevent the occurrence of overt side effects, and up to 120 mg/day may be required. Although baclofen is well tolerated in most patients, limiting side effects such as sedation and increased muscle weakness may occur, and rarely a paradoxical increase in spasticity is noted. Liver enzyme elevation and nonconvulsive status epilepticus presenting as encephalopathy have also been reported in association with baclofen. Abrupt withdrawal of baclofen may result in hallucinations or seizures, making it necessary to taper doses. Despite symptomatic improvement, antispasticity measures may not increase function or independence. In paraplegic patients with severe spasticity and intolerance to the required oral dose, intrathecal baclofen delivered by a subcutaneously implanted pump allows a much smaller dose and is often effective in alleviating intractable spasticity and may lessen urinary urgency. Tizanidine seems to be as effective as baclofen, although it may be associated with more fatigue. Dantrolene has been used for spasticity, although the therapeutic window is small.",

Symptoms that suggest urinary retention (a feeling of incomplete emptying, frequency, hesitancy, or a need to apply pressure to the lower abdomen to urinate) should prompt evaluation with urinalysis and a post-void residual urine measurement. Residuals in excess of 15 mL are abnormal; and if they are above 50 mL, consideration should be given to urological consultation for more thorough investigation and to blood chemistries to determine urea and creatinine levels. Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, diagnosed by cystometrography, is treated with anticholinergics, sometimes with the addition of an a-1 blocking agent (terazosin) or intermittent catheterization. It is important to reassess bladder function periodically, and residual urine volumes should be monitored if there are any persistent changes in function or symptoms. Intermittent catheterization should be considered when post-void residuals reach 100 mL. A chronic indwelling urinary catheter should be avoided if reasonably possible.

Smoking, excess alcohol intake, and obesity should be avoided. Exercise can help maximize function by increasing and maintaining joint mobility, strength, and stamina; may promote improved sleep hygiene; and may reduce the severity of fatigue. Physical and occupational therapy can play an important role in regaining independence. Canes, walkers, and wheelchairs or scooters may be needed to maintain safe mobility. Hand controls can be installed in automobiles for patients with lower extremity dysfunction. In debilitated, immobilized patients, periodic shifts in posture to change weight-bearing regions and air or water mattresses prevent bedsores. Passive range of motion exercises prevent contractures. When ventilatory dysfunction occurs, it should be evaluated and activity schedules should be appropriately modified. 111 Special Considerations during Pregnancy. Before initiation of any drug in a woman of reproductive age, the potential for teratogenicity must be discussed. In general, immunomodulator therapy should be avoided if one is planning a pregnancy. The treatment of acute exacerbations is unchanged during pregnancy, although one might have a higher threshold for treatment. Both corticosteroids and plasma exchange are relatively safe during pregnancy. None of the drugs used to alter the disease course, however, should be used during pregnancy. Interferon-b drugs should be stopped 2 to 3 months before planning pregnancy. Interferons are associated with an approximately 39% likelihood of abortions. This is close to eight times higher than the usually quoted approximately 5% spontaneous abortion rate in women. Interferon-b use is also associated with lower birth weight. 112 The cytotoxic immunosuppressants have teratogenic effects. The effects of many of the other drugs are unknown. It is best if these drugs are stopped several months before a planned pregnancy.",

A score of 0 means no signs or symptoms; 1 to 3 represent mild disability with no or minimal impairment of ambulation; 3.5 to 5.5 refer to moderate disability and impairment of gait; the need for a cane to walk one-half block (100 m) receives a score of 6; an EDSS of 8 refers to the need for a wheelchair and effective upper extremity function; an EDSS of 10 refers to death related to MS.",

Autopsy series have estimated that unsuspected MS may occur in as many as 0.2% of the population. Even when symptomatic, MS may cause only nuisance symptoms. Benign MS, when defined as unrestricted ambulation or EDSS of 3 or less 10 years after onset, accounts for about one third of cases. However, many of these patients acquire more disability later. When considering all patients with MS, Weinshenker found that 15 years after onset, 80% had EDSS worse than 3, 50% had reached EDSS of 6 or more, 10% were at EDSS 8, and 2% had died. The percentage of patients with initially RRMS who develop SPMS increases steadily with disease duration. 113 At 10 years, 40% to 50% have continual deterioration; after 25 years, approximately 80% have slow progression. In the most recent study published about the Olmsted County MS prevalence cohort consisting of 161 patients, the mean change in EDSS over 10 years was 1 point, and only 20% of patients had a change larger than 2.0 points. 114 Eighty-three percent of the patients with mild symptoms (EDSS < 3.0) were still ambulatory without cane 10 years later. Among the patients with an EDSS of 3 to 5, 51% were using a cane; in the 6 to 7 EDDS range, 51% were wheelchair bound. Strong predictors for the outcome were not identified in this study. Population-based studies with complete ascertainment can effectively remove the bias of a referral practice, which is inherently biased towards the more active and more serious cases. These studies also provide some much needed balance to the \"heavily skewed for recent disease activity\" clinical trial experience.",

Also, patients with Devic's disease may have other coexisting autoimmune conditions. Classically, acute spinal cord lesions demonstrate diffuse swelling that extend over several levels or involve nearly the entire cross section of the cord. Acutely, there is destruction with dense macrophage infiltration involving white and gray matter, loss of myelin and axons, and lymphocytic cuffing of vessels. In chronic lesions, the cord is atrophic and necrotic, occasionally with cystic degeneration and gliosis. In the absence of perivascular cuffing, these extensive lesions resemble infarctions. The prominent spinal cord swelling in the confines of the restrictive pia presumably may raise intramedullary pressure, leading to the collapse of small parenchymal vessels, further propagating tissue injury. Proliferation of vessels with thickened and hyalinized walls similar to that seen after infarction or other extensive injury may occur. 116 Less fulminant lesions may coexist and are much more typical of inflammatory demyelination. The optic nerve lesions often involve the chiasm. Even though NMO is usually restricted to the optic nerves and spinal cord, one may see classic MS like lesions in up to 10% of cases, and hypothalamic lesions have also been described in approximately 10%. The newly discovered serum marker, NMO-IgG has a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 91%. 117 The discovery of this novel immune marker also clarified that most if not all cases of \"opticospinal MS\" reported in the Japanese literature are also cases of NMO. To the surprise of the MS research community, the antigen is neither myelin nor neuron related: it is the aquaporin-4 water channel, a component of the dystroglycan protein complex located in astrocytic foot processes at the bloodbrain barrier. 11 NMO thus may represent the first example of a novel class of autoimmune channelopathies.",

Monophasic Devic's syndrome affects males and females equally, whereas relapsing NMO affects females predominantly (F:M, 3.8:1). One third of patients have a preceding infection within a few weeks of neurological symptom onset. Most commonly this is a nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection, flu, or gastroenteritis. The most common specific infections preceding the development of Devic's syndrome are chickenpox and pulmonary tuberculosis. Devic's syndrome has also followed vaccination for swine flu and mumps. Only a few instances of a possible familial occurrence of Devic's syndrome have been reported, and in one of these families, a unique mitochondrial mutation was found. Devic's syndrome is said to be more common in Japan and East Asia, although even there it is uncommon (less than 5 per 100,000). Three cases have been described in the literature with familial occurrence of Devic's disease in the Far East.

Patients showing characteristics of the relapsing form of Devic's had a median interval of 166 days between index events, followed within 3 years by clusters of severe relapses isolated to the optic nerves and spinal cord. Most relapsing patients developed severe disability in a stepwise manner. Approximately one third died from respiratory failure. Predictors of a relapsing course in NMO 118 include longer inter-attack intervals (relative risk [RR]: 2.16 per month increase), older age at onset (RR \u00bc 1.08 per year increase), female sex (RR \u00bc 10.0), and less severe motor impairment with sentinel myelitis event (RR \u00bc 0.48 per severity scale point increase).

There is considerable overlap in the epidemiological, clinical, CSF, imaging, and pathological features between ADEM and MS, often making it difficult to distinguish between the two with reasonable confidence when encountering patients with a single demyelinating event.",

ADEM closely resembles the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis animal model of MS (EAE) both clinically and pathologically, and is most likely due to a transient autoimmune response toward myelin. The occurrence of ADEM after vaccination with the rabbit spinal cord preparation of rabies virus led to the discovery of EAE. Infections and non-CNScontaining vaccinations may induce ADEM by molecular mimicry or by activating autoreactive T-cell clones in a nonspecific manner. Lymphocyte reactivity toward MBP has been identified in blood and CSF from patients with ADEM, but its absence in others indicates a role for other antigens. Increased peripheral blood g interferon-producing T cells have been described in ADEM.",

In addition, there are case reports of ADEM following hepatitis B vaccination. However, the only epidemiologically and pathologically proved association is with rabies vaccination, which also causes demyelinating peripheral neuropathies. The original Pasteur rabies vaccine, prepared in rabbit spinal cord, was associated with an incidence of ADEM of approximately 1 per 3000 to 1 per 35,000 vaccinations and is no longer in use. A later vaccine, made in duck embryo, which contains little neural tissue, carries a risk for ADEM of 1 per 25,000 vaccines. The use of human diploid cell lines, which contain no nervous system tissue, for the production of rabies vaccine has virtually eliminated the risk of ADEM. The association of bee stings with ADEM has also been reported.",

Measles carries the highest risk for ADEM of any infection, occurring in 1 per 400 to 1 per 1000 cases.

            "text": "CLINICAL FEATURES AND ASSOCIATED DISOR-DERS. A prodrome of headache, low-grade fever, myalgias, and malaise often precedes the onset of ADEM by a few days. In a German study of 40 cases, 122 the most frequent clinical signs were motor deficit (80%), followed by sensory deficits, brain stem signs, and cerebellar signs. CSF findings were variable; normal results were present in up to 20% of patients. Oligoclonal bands were positive in over 60%. Almost all patients improved during the acute phase of the disease. Of the 26 patients with the final diagnosis of ADEM, 21 had minor or no symptoms, 2 died, the rest had moderate symptoms. Compared to MS patients, the ADEM patients were older, and more often had a preceding infection, clinical signs of brain stem involvement, a higher CSF albumin fraction, and infratentorial lesions. Neurological symptoms develop rapidly in the acute phase and are commonly associated with encephalopathy, stupor, coma, meningismus, and seizures. Peak severity occurs within several days, and recovery may begin soon afterward. Occasionally, ADEM may evolve over a few months and there may be a second clinical deterioration or subacute progression for a time. In these unusual cases, the distinction from MS is difficult. Three recent large retrospective series and an accompanying editorial have highlighted that there remain no clinical or laboratory features that accurately allow one to predict which adult or pediatric ADEM patients will develop. [122] [123] [124] [125] DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS. One of the primary concerns after a single demyelinating episode is whether other bouts can be expected (e.g., MS). Several features may tip the balance toward one or the other, but the proper diagnosis becomes apparent only with time. Classically, ADEM is characterized by the multifocal involvement at onset whereas MS often presents with monosymptomatic deficits such as ON. However, ADEM may cause unifocal symptoms and MS may present with multifocal CNS involvement, especially in children. The monosymptomatic deficits caused by ADEM are more commonly severe, such as bilateral ON and complete transverse myelitis. Although OCBs occur transiently in about one third of ADEM cases, their persistence implies a diagnosis of MS. The subsequent disappearance of OCBs, when performed by consistent techniques, is evidence against MS. The MRI appearance of these two disorders is often identical, 125 but the presence of basal ganglia or cortical lesions, or large globular white matter lesions, is more frequent in ADEM.",
