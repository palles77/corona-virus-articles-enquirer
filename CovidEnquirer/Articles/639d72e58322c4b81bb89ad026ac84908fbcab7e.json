The article aims to assess how rigorously the Korean field of disaster management research resources has been managed or how it can be improved for the ultimate goal of disaster management. Descriptive content analysis has been used as the major methodology by referring to the Johari window. In doing so, electronic research resources have been systematically compared with integrated research resources via the perspective of Korean-speaking researchers and that of English-speaking researchers. The conclusion is that two researchers have to be integrated with all four research resources (open, blind, hidden, and unknown resources) by implementing assigned responsibilities as well as freely asking questions. Ultimately, this will be conducive to reducing down the impacts of disaster in Korea.",
