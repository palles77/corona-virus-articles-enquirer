Participants in the treatment condition underwent a 7-week group based CBP, which addressed various HIV-related issues. Relevant cognitive and behavioral strategies were taught as well. The aim of treatment was to improve the quality of life and to reduce psychological distress in a sample of heterosexual symptomatic HIV-infected men. Prior to intervention, baseline measures showed that our sample had a lower quality of life in comparison with the local general population. They also experienced a significant level of psychological distress. Following intervention, men in the CBP group demonstrated significant improvement in the mental health dimension of quality of life and a significant reduction in depressed mood. These preliminary findings suggested that short-term cognitive-behavioral therapy can be effective in improving the quality of life and mood of Chinese heterosexual HIV-infected men.",

Subsequent to the first and the strongest impact of the initial news of seropositivity, infected persons have to experience lots of direct burdens and changes in lifestyle including overt signs of progressive physical deterioration [2] , legal and societal stigmas [3, 4] , and possibly multiple bereavements [5] . Several studies found that adjustment disorder with depressed mood is very common among HIV-infected patients [6] [7] [8] [9] . Although HIV-infected persons may not be afflicted with clinical affective disorder, many of them experience significant levels of distress. Therefore, emotional adjustment is a major dimension of quality of life that is relevant to them.",

Hong Kong has been experiencing an economic downturn in recent years. Many of our patients have had to work long working hours and were unable to attend a 7-week treatment group punctually. This may have affected our sample size to some extent. In addition, this sample was a highly selective sample of generally literate men who voluntarily participate in a fairly demanding study of CBP and HIV. Self-selection factors may have biased the sample toward men who used more active coping. Thus, these findings may not generalize to those less motivated HIV-infected patients.",

The contribution of those nonspecific factors should be further examined. Although the present results suggested that cognitive behavioral intervention was able to alleviate psychological distress in our sample, the potential for long-term gain is not known. Three-month follow-up data was planned to be obtained from our sample initially.

Nevertheless, two aspects of these men were observed to be rather different from the Western world. First, Chinese men usually place great values on family relationships. The disclosure of being HIV positive and the physical illness itself made them worry that they could no longer perform the role of caregivers in their families. This brought great impact on the macho image they used to hold. Strategies that help to redefine their roles and to adjust their expectation on themselves in the family would be beneficial to them. Second, Chinese generally tend to communicate their negative affects in terms of physical symptoms, such as chest discomfort, headache and stomachache. Additional time was required to educate and encourage our participants to express their emotions and to attribute signs of emotional distress more correctly.",

They share many common psychological impacts and challenges related to HIV infection. In the era of managed care and with the pressure to provide more time-limited treatments, it is important to learn that such treatments are effective and feasible in Chinese heterosexual men despite the few differences observed. Meanwhile, social support emerged to be a critical element in alleviating the psychological distress of our patients. They are often frustrated and angry about the stigma relating to AIDS. There is rarely any opportunity to ventilate their feelings and grief. A group based psychological treatment may specifically target such needs so that patients can openly discuss concerns and provide enhanced social support. It will be helpful for future research to employ process analyses to help us better understand the mechanism in the reduction of distress among HIV-infected men.",
