Outbreaks of new pathogens are often ignited by the emergence and transmission of mutant variants descended from wildtype strains circulating in the community. In this work we investigate the stochastic dynamics of the emergence of a novel disease strain, introduced into a population in which it must compete with an existing endemic strain. In analogy with past work on single-strain epidemic outbreaks, we apply a branching process approximation to calculate the probability that the new strain becomes established. As expected, a critical determinant of the survival prospects of any invading strain is the magnitude of its reproduction number relative to that of the background endemic strain. Whilst in most circumstances this ratio must exceed unity in order for invasion to be viable, we show that differential control scenarios can lead to less-fit novel strains invading populations hosting a fitter endemic one. This analysis and the accompanying findings will inform our understanding of the mechanisms that have led to past instances of successful strain invasion, and provide valuable lessons for thwarting future drug-resistant strain incursions.",

The incidence of cases infected with non-wild-type variants of pathogenic diseases continues to rise with endemic levels already witnessed in several regions ( McKenna, 2013; Laxminarayan et al., 2013 ) . Exacerbating the problem is the growing misuse and overuse of antimicrobial agents which, rather than suppressing pathogen strain diversity, often acts to accelerate the spread and diversification of mutant variants ( Barbosa and Levy, 20 0 0; Neu, 1992 ) . More broadly, the emergence of new pathogen strains that have evolved to escape natural immunity within a population pose substantial risks to public health. Alarmingly, in many settings, direct transmission of these mutant pathogens is believed to have become the primary source of incident cases ( Luciani et al., 2009; others, 2018 ) suggesting that intervention strategies targeting the transmission and treatment of wild-type strains alone will likely fail.

Not only do mutant strains arise as a result of random microbiological processes ( Alekshun and Levy, 2007 ) , but phenotypically distinct variants initially appear in small numbers of hosts and must therefore escape a treacherous stochastic regime (i.e., avoid extinction) in order to establish themselves within the community. Often furthering this challenge is the presence of a resident endemic (possibly ancestral) strain that deprives the newly-emergent mutant of susceptible hosts (e.g., through cross-immunity). In spite of these challenges, countless mutant pathogens -often exhibiting varying levels of drug-resistance -have flourished and been able to firmly entrench themselves among host populations ( Chang et al., 2015 ) .",

The goal of this paper is to analyze the early-time dynamics of novel strain emergence in a stochastic setting whilst accounting for the background population dynamics associated with endemic infection. In particular, we investigate the conditions under which invasion by a novel strain is possible and calculate the probability of this event occurring, depending on the relative fitness (i.e., reproductive capacity) of the two strains, and the relevant characteristics of the host population (i.e., the heterogeneity in individual reproductive capacity). We then analyze the effects of control strategies and timing on the emergence of novel strains and discuss the implications of differential control efficacy when the invading strain boasts some level of resistance to treatment. The results of this investigation will extend analogous findings in single-strain settings and elucidate the consequences of different control mechanisms/timings in multistrain systems -particularly the impact of differential control. Moreover the analytical framework that we develop will provide a flexible and robust theoretical basis for future modelling work.",

In this case the depletion of susceptible individuals due to infection is negligible such that (in an infection-na\u00efve population) the susceptible fraction remains approximately equal to one.

This outcome becomes increasingly likely as R 0 increases. A significant recent contribution to this theory is the work by Lloyd-Smith et al. ( Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005 ) in which the authors highlighted the importance of heterogeneity in individual infectiousness among members of the host population and its role in determining the fate of an infectious disease outbreak. By analyzing secondary case counts from several historical infectious disease outbreaks, including the 2003 outbreak of severe acute res-piratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore, the authors demonstrated that in order to accurately reconstruct observed epidemics, models must account for individual heterogeneity in reproductive potential. In particular, they found that observed secondary case counts follow highly skewed distributions where outbreaks are driven by a small subset of so-called 'super-spreaders': individuals that generate a disproportionately large number of secondary cases, and that the large majority of infected individuals lead to no, or few, secondary infections. As a consequence of this disparity, the probability of extinction increases and epidemics become rarer (but more explosive), as heterogeneity increases. Importantly, their findings show that previous analyses that rely solely on population mean parameters -such as the basic reproduction number R 0 -to model outbreak dynamics inadequately capture the true stochastic nature of disease spread, because the prospects of an epidemic outbreak depend critically on the distribution of infection potential within the host population. This work has since been extended in Yates et al. (2006) using a multi-type branching process framework to incorporate other forms of heterogeneity including susceptibility and assortative mixing leading to similar conclusions.",

We apply a branching process approximation to calculate the probability that strain i establishes itself within the community, i.e., avoids extinction, but note that the approximation used must necessarily account for the impact of the resident strain on the capacity of the invader to infect individuals. We note that Leventhal et al. (2015) take a similar branching process-based approach, but consider network structure explicitly, rather than allowing contact between any pairs of individuals as is the case here, i.e., we consider a well-mixed population. For simplicity, we assume that the background infection is in some quasi-stationary distribution ( sensu Bartlett (1957) ). We also assume that the population is large, so that given the presence of the resident strain r , there remain sufficient susceptible individuals that the introduction of the invading strain i can be approximated by a branching process, and that early in the outbreak of i , the fraction of the population that are susceptible does not change substantially. Analysis is possible when these assumptions are broken, with results similar to those presented here; however these scenarios are often substantially more complex, and do not cover the full range of intervention scenarios considered here. For example, Hartfield and Alizon (2014) consider a scenario in which the resident strain is not in equilibrium, resulting in a more complex branching process approximation, and Humplik et al. (2014) evaluate establishment probability in a simple SIS model, but with finite N explicitly without a branching process approximation. More broadly, we emphasise that invasion of a second disease against an endemic strain in a fully-mixed population is a setting that has been considered several times previously, with early results in deterministic systems producing similar outcomes to those presented here (see e.g., Levin and Pimentel, 1981 ) .",

The difference between these two cases is the number of susceptible individuals made available to the newly introduced invading strain. In the simultaneous case, the susceptible pool remains depleted by the presence of the resident strain such that the invading strain is inhibited by both a reduced S(t = 0) = N/R r 0 and the added burden of control.

For example, given that both infection potential and susceptibility are functions of the number of contacts an individual experiences, these quantities may be naturally correlated. Leventhal et al. (2015) approach this problem by imposing an explicit contact-network structure on the study population, such that heterogeneity in susceptibility was directly linked to the heterogeneity in infectiousness through the (fixed) number of contacts shared by each individual. In this context, invasion events were found to be less likely because potential 'super-spreading' hosts (or hubs in the network) were often already infected with the resident strain meaning they were unable to perpetuate the spread of the invading strain, whilst simultaneously providing protection to susceptible satellite nodes.

For instance, replacement infection or co-infection with e.g., influenza, streptococcus, staphylococcus is known to occur.

While this does not influence the impacts of control qualitatively, we emphasize that under the branching process approximation it does impact how likely the invading strain is to establish. In particular, invaders are less likely to establish when individual reproductive capacities are more highly dispersed. However, we note that this heterogeneity also has a subtler effect: the error between simulated epidemic results and the branching process approximation varies in both magnitude, and direction, with k ( Fig. 9 ) . One clear possibility is that if a 'super-spreader' individual emerges early in an outbreak, it may allow a strain to establish itself when it otherwise would not have. In addition, since the heterogeneity also influences the resident strain, increased heterogeneity both enables the natural extinction of the resident strain ( Fig. 10 ) , and more generally variation of the initial susceptible proportion faced by the invader away from N/R r 0 . Applying a branching process approximation for the emergence of a new strain in the presence of an endemic background, rather than into a na\u00efve population, requires care. Our simulation study determined that the approximation was quite robust even for relatively small populations (e.g., N \u2265 500). However, there was some variation due to different parameter choices at smaller population sizes. In particular, accuracy varied when heterogeneity in individual reproductive capacity was high, and when parameter choices caused the endemic disease to be at risk of natural extinction (even without the influence of the invader). We also emphasize that the branching process approximation is limited in that it can only quantify the probability of initial strain extinction: There is likely some additional probability of subsequent fade-out due to depletion of susceptibles (e.g., sensu Ballard et al. (2016) ). A separate analysis would be necessary to investigate this phenomenon.",

It would be interesting then to re-evaluate our results with a coupling between the two strains: our expectation is that with a perpetual supply of reinforcements, replacement with any fitter (i.e., R i 0 > R r 0 ) variants is guaranteed -it just a question of when. Further, assuming an ancestral relationship between the competing strains we could also model multiple epochs (i.e., we would not terminate the simulation after a single replacement event has occurred) and follow the evolution of the pathogen (see also ( Yates et al., 2006 ) ).

In addition to population-wide effects, this has important implications at the individual level, where the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics can inadvertently eliminate colonizing bacterial infections (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus ), and thus further highlights the importance of antibiotic stewardship. Perhaps the most critical outcome of this work is the potential for the invading strain to become established even when it is less transmissible than the resident due to differential control. The emergence of mutant strains in the presence of endemic backgrounds is of substantial concern in many disease settings (particularly e.g., Tuberculosis), and the impact of differential control highlighted here should be considered in any future control effort s as well as effort s to model multi-strain dynamics in these systems.

The most substantial difference was that, particularly at smaller population sizes, the invader had some chance to become established even when R i eff was 1.0; and this was more likely for more heterogeneous individual reproductive capacity distributions. One possible explanation for this is that the empirical distribution of transmissibility in a (small) finite population may not match the generating distribution (and, in particular, the average transmissibility of the invader may be substantially greater than expected). Intuitively, this could occur when the initial invading individual was a 'superspreader' (i.e., an individual with high individual reproductive capacity).

While the process we consider is not the same, we can use this as a heuristic. Rather than the full population, we are interested in the population of susceptible individuals, given the circulation of the endemic disease in the population. We denote this S 0, and note that it is approximately N R r 0 .
