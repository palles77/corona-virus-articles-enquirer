Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted nowcasting.",

The Korean outbreak, while large, was concentrated amongst the young recruits of the Schincheonji religious group (6) , with only 3.3% of cases falling into the very vulnerable >80 group. (7) Singapore is notable with zero deaths thus far, but have had only one confirmed case over 80 and only 10/200 cases above age 70. (8) COVID-19 transmission chains that begin in younger populations may have a low number of severe cases and thus go longer undetected, (9, 10) with countries thereby slow to raise the alarm. The low case fatality rate in England thus far (0.01%) may reflect the relatively young age structure of populations impacted to date, including Greater London, which has a small fraction of residents over age 65 compared to more rural areas (11). COVID-19 was only detected in King County, Washington once it reached the Life Care Centre in Kirkland, where 19 out of 22 deaths occurred, despite estimates based on virus genetic sequences suggesting it circulated for several weeks prior (12). Once community transmission is established, countries that have a high level of intergenerational contacts and coresidence may see faster transmission to high-fatality age groups as seen in Italy.",

In the bottom panel, we consider two countries yet untouched by the pandemic who have similar population sizes but very different age distributions. In Brazil, which has 2.0% of its population age 80+, the simulated scenario leads dramatically more deaths (478,629) compared to Nigeria (137,489), where the fraction over 80 is only 0.2%. Figure 2 uses an alternative visualization to depict the expected deaths by age groups in Italy, Brazil, Nigeria, UK and US, together with the proportion of the population in different age groups.

While population age structure is crucial for understanding the populations at the highest risk of mortality both across and within countries, it is also vital for understanding how much social distancing measures are required in each population to reduce the number of most critical cases and overload on the health system-aka \"flattening the curve\"(13). Our illustrations show that countries with older populations will need to take more aggressive protective measures to stay below the threshold of critical cases that outstrip health system capacity. For these measures to be effective, special attention should be devoted to those population groups that are more at risk and patterns of intergenerational contact.",

Population ageing is currently more pronounced in wealthier countries, which mercifully may lessen the impact of this pandemic on poorer countries with weaker health systems but younger age structures. It is plausible that poor general health status and coinfections such as tuberculosis may still increase the danger of COVID-19 among younger cases in these countries. Thus far, the lower than expected number of cases detected in Africa (despite extensive trade and travel links with China), suggests that the young age structure of the continent may be protective of severe and thus detectable cases, or it may be undetected. Beyond age structure, there are large sex differences in mortality that need to be understood -with men at higher risk -some of which may be accounted for by the stark differences in smoking rates by sex in Asia. Distributions of underlying comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and COPD will likewise refine risk estimates. Until these more nuanced data are available, the concentration of mortality risk in the oldest old ages remains one of the best tools we have to predict the burden of critical cases and thus more precise planning of availability of hospital beds, staff and other resources.",

Although proximity is the highest in smaller villages and in poorer regions, the geography of proximity across Italy is rather homogeneous, with the two richest regions -Lombardy and Trentino-Alto Adige -showing high rates of proximity as well. Even when intergenerational families do not live under the same roof, daily contacts among non-co-resident parent-child pairs are frequent. While on the one hand, this geographical proximity guarantees high rates of mutual intergenerational solidarity, both financial and in-kind, one obvious consequence is that Italians often prefer not to move for work but to live close to their family and commute daily to go to work.

Individuals' social networks are generally composed of people similar in age. The population structure of contact can be represented as age-homogeneous communities that have low contact between groups. If the initial infections in northern Italy were younger people commuting to cities and having plausibly international contacts, a crucial determinant of risk for the elderly is their network distance to these younger sources, i.e. how many intermediaries need to be infected until they are reached. Network science showed that even relatively few connections between communities can lead to a stark reduction in average network distances; the so-called small world phenomenon 5 . Such community \"connecting\" individuals might be those young people around Milan that work in the city but reside in the most hard-hit villages in the surrounding with their parents and grandparents. Thus, intergenerational co-residence may have accelerated the outbreak by creating intercommunity connections that increase the proximity of elderly to the initial cases, an area for further study. .
