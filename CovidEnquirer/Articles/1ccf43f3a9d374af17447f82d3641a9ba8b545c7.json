Adsorption with hydroxylapatite successfully removed virus from faecal material. However, the resultant virus was contaminated and some virus was left behind in the faecal suspension. Repeated adsorption with hydroxylapatite appeared to result in some damage to the virus particles. In contrast, density gradient centrifugation provided a simple, economical method of purification which yielded uncontaminated, infectious virus. The final method, using both isopyknic and rate zonal centrifugation is described.",

Tissue culture virus given by the oral and parenteral route has been used most frequently and although infection, as measured by seroconversion and viral excretion, is recorded there has been a lack of severe clinical signs in most infected dogs in the published reports. Carman and Povey (1982) observed severe illness in 22 out of 24 dogs infected with filtered mucosal scrapings prepared from clinically infected dogs. As a potent method of challenge, the use of filtered scrapings would appear to be satisfactory but the technique has certain important disadvantages. First, it is difficult to ensure that this type of inoculum is uncontaminated by adventitious agents and, secondly, only small amounts of virus may remain in tissues at the time of clinical disease (Macartney et al 1984a ,b, Meunier et al 1985 .",

A technique to purify such material should ensure that adventitious agents are removed, the infectivity of the parvovirus is unimpaired and that the methodology is simple and economic.",

The appearance and dimensions of the latter was consistent with bacteriophage fragments. In contrast, purification of parvovirus from faeces by ultracentrifugation fulfilled all three criteria: the method was simple, large amounts of uncontaminated virus were obtained and the virus had high infectivity. The isopyknic technique had the additional advantage of separating full and empty particles provided the gradient was not overloaded. The high density of CPV makes it very suitable for separation by this means. The larger enteric viruses, for example, coronavirus with a density of 1'14 D, paramyxovirus i-2 D, adenovirus i-34 D and rotavirus i-3 D would all be left behind at their position of isodensity as CPV sedimented down to the region of 1'4 D. When contamination with bacteriophage fragments was present they could be removed by further zonal centrifugation.",
