This article estimates the short-and long-term impact of the US FAA downgrade of the Philippine civil aviation system in 2008 and the EU ban of Philippine carriers in 2010 on tourist expenditures, arrivals, and length of stay using monthly time series data. The econometric model, consisting of three equations due to the endogeneity of the tourist arrivals and length of stay variables in the tourist expenditures equation, is estimated simultaneously using the generalized method of moments. The results indicate that the US FAA downgrade and the EU ban impact monthly tourist receipts negatively in the short term while the downgrade also impacts tourist expenditures in the long term. Moreover, the ban impacts length of stay negatively in the short and long term while the downgrade impacts length of stay negatively only in the long term. The substantial decline in tourism receipts from 2008 to 2010 despite an increasing trend in tourist arrivals is due to the shorter stay of tourists, indicating that high-spending tourists have not returned following the downgrade and ban.",

For an archipelagic country such as the Philippines that is blessed with beautiful, world-class beaches and coastal resources, tourism is vital to its overall socioeconomic development plan. Considered as part of a country's export industry-with importers as tourists visiting the country-tourism has the potential to unlock innumerable economic opportunities for a country: from increased foreign currency receipts to the generation of jobs from allied industries such as the hotel, entertainment, transportation, and food industries. Much of this promise though hangs on how government is able to address the safety and security issues of its civil aviation system, such as airports and airlines, which tourists and business travelers consider important.",

The threat of hijacking, drug trafficking, and bomb scare in airplanes and airports are all very real for the air transport industry, especially after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the United States (US). In order to prevent these incidents, governments-on their own and in the interest of making air travel safer and more secure, have made investments to improve the security infrastructure and management of their civil aviation system. To verify whether improvements in the civil aviation safety standards are tenable and compliant with mutually-agreed civil aviation safety and security standards, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken on the role as verifier and arbiter of air transport safety standards and airport security outside the US, especially in countries and airports that service US airlines as well as those that service non-US airlines with flights to the US.",

Shocks to consumer confidence such as economic and financial crises and high unemployment rates in countries where most tourists to the Philippines originate may complicate the impact of the US FAA downgrade and EU ban on tourism demand although Gounopoulos et al. (2012) argue that macroeconomic shocks on the consumer confidence in tourists' origin countries do not have a significant impact on tourism demand. Government failure as the source of negative impact on a country's tourism industry has yet to be explored and examined inasmuch as poorly designed and executed policies can cause deleterious effects to a country and to its tourism and related industries as a whole.",

Narayan (2005) reports a similar case in Fiji where the negative shocks of coups in 1987 and 2000 only had a temporary effect on tourist expenditures while Kraipornsak (2011) argues that that negative shocks are insignificant compared with income elasticity or real personal income factor in explaining tourist arrivals in Thailand. These results corroborate the transitory impact of shocks, i.e., terrorism and political instability, on tourism demand in Israel and Egypt (Aly and Strazicich, 2000) .",

The two external policy shocks, which resulted from the Philippine government's failure to comply with international civil aviation safety standards, originate from the policy decision of the FAA when the agency downgraded the Philippine civil aviation system to Category 2, and the EU, when its governing council banned Philippine carriers from its airspace. Without a coordinated response from the destination country, the external policy shocks translate into a government failure, affecting tourism demand in the destination country. The impact of external policy shocks on the tourism industry, however, has received little attention in the literature. This article seeks to improve our understanding of the impact external policy decisions have on the tourism industry of another country by examining the impact of the FAA downgrade and EU ban on tourist expenditures, arrivals, and length of stay using Philippine data.",

While the literature supports the use of CPIs as proxy for the price of goods and services that foreign visitors purchase, relative CPIs between the Philippines and the countries of origin of tourists are not significant in predicting international tourism to the Philippines (Deluna and Jeon, 2014) . Moreover, CPIs cannot be used as proxy for the price competitiveness of tourism-related purchases in the Philippines because the government measures CPIs as \"changes in the price level of goods and services that most [Filipino households purchase] for their day-to-day consumption\" (Sta. Ana and Varona, 2004) . Since international tourism and tourism-related purchases are considered luxury items (Park et al., 2011) , there is hardly any meaningful association between the tourist price index (TPI), which is not available, and what most Filipino households purchase for their daily consumption. Moreover, Lim (1997) reports that a number of \"researchers argue that tourists respond to exchange rate movements when they make their decision to travel, because of limited knowledge\" on local prices and the prices of competing goods and services. Thus, the real exchange rate is a better proxy for the TPI as well as the price competitiveness of goods and services that tourists purchase in the Philippines and in competing destination countries.",

The estimation method uses two-stage least squares coefficients with GMM standard errors using an optimal weighting matrix (Cameron and Trivedi, 2009), resulting in robust estimators and standard errors.

This may be due to the difficulty of canceling or modifying travel plans at the last minute or the financial cost associated with trip cancelation or modification, especially for business trips and visits to relatives. As mentioned earlier, the impact of the downgrade and ban on tourist arrivals is moderated by the millions of ethnic Filipinos with foreign passports who travel to the Philippines regularly. The reverse sign may also be due to the absence of major air transport accidents in the Philippines in the year immediately before and following the downgrade and ban, giving foreign visitors the impression that Philippine carriers and the civil aviation industry are relatively safe. The results also indicate the resilience of the tourism industry in the Philippines despite lingering safety concerns on its civil aviation industry by international aviation safety organizations. The absence of a negative impact of the downgrade and ban on tourist arrivals is similar to Thailand's-external shocks are insignificant to tourists' decision to visit and revisit (Kraipornsak, 2011) . The reverse sign of the downgrade and ban is consistent with the increasing trend in monthly tourist arrivals in Fig. 5 . The negative impact of the FAA downgrade and EU ban on tourism receipts (refer to Table 1 ) and their positive impact on tourist arrivals (refer to Table 5 ) are consistent with the observation of Campos-Soria et al.

An additional tourist spends USD 962 per stay while extending a visit for just one night results in USD 28.38 million additional tourism receipts per month.

The average length of stay decreased for three straight years from 2008 to 2010 and only slightly recovered in 2011 (refer to Table 2 ).The shorter stay partly explains the lower tourism receipts in the same period compared with the 2007 level. The impact of economic growth and expected daily expenditures on length of stay, though positive, is trivial while external shocks tend to impact length of stay negatively.
