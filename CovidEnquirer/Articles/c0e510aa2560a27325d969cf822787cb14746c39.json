The treatment of fresh water and additives, control of the residence time in the storage tanks, and control of the stagnant flow areas should be done to control the contamination sources and the microbiological populations. Systematic maintenance and cleaning of the system by using different chemicals or treatments to reduce the formation of deposits and to eliminate the already formed deposits is required. A microbiological control program requires a good knowledge of the system and the main sources of contamination. Once the sources of contamination have been reduced, the paper manufacturer can control the microbiological populations of the system. Good housekeeping and regular inspection of all areas, effective boilouts, and regularly scheduled washup reduces slime development.",

This is because control of microorganisms is connected to the overall operational practices in the mill.

Even the best biocide program will be stressed to maintain microbial control of the process without the execution of good housekeeping practices. According to Woodward (2009) , basic housekeeping starts with the standard \"first in, first out\" rule. To avoid long storage times, this should be basic rule for all the containers, particularly for the chemicals because they might be stored by the machine for weeks. The hoses should also be washed when filling the tanks and containers. Other good housekeeping practices include: cleaning tanks on a routine basis, sufficient agitation and recirculation, and at least annual system-wide boilouts. If the time and temperature in boilouts are limited, using some special chemicals or enzymes could be taken into consideration (Woodward, 2009) . To some extent, good housekeeping can also be automated (Kiuru, 2011) . On-line cleaning can be applied to essentially any position in the papermaking process. An electric-driven water pump can be used that uses the cleanest return water available from the process. The commodity items are the spray nozzles and the joint piping connections permitting ease of piping travel through elevation and direction changes to continuously clean, for example, the entire wire channel with a single flow. Parks (2007) has reported that this type of automated mechanical cleaning \u2022 Reduces manual cleaning \u2022 Reduces paper quality issues like spots and tears \u2022 Reduces need for unexplained, unplanned refeed and restart exercises \u2022 Reduces waste amount \u2022 Improves paper quality \u2022 Reduces biocide usage",

            "text": "Boilouts are widely used in the paper industry, particularly in fine paper mills (Lindvall, 2000; Kiuru, 2011) . They are very effective at cleaning the internals, piping and headbox of the short whitewater circuit. Boilout emphasizes the use of high temperatures to clean papermaking equipment. Steam is mostly used for the heating of solutions used for washups of the short loop of paper machine systems, but temperatures are normally in the range of 60-71 \u00b0C (Guillory, 1998; Guillory and Towery, 1998) . Boilout involves treatment with an alkaline detergent solution, having a pH in the range of 10-13. But acidic solutions may also be used depending on the nature of the deposited materials. By using enzymes capable of breaking down the binder materials in a variety of deposits, the use of high or low pH solutions can be avoided (Anstey et al., 1998a,b) . Paper mills periodically shut down operations and clean the wetted surfaces of a paper machine, usually with an emphasis on the short-loop recirculation system and wet-press section (Glazer, 1991; Guillory, 1998; Guillory and Towery, 1998) . Papermaking efficiency and product quality often suffer if too much time elapses between such cleanups (Stitt, 1997) . Schwamberger and Wormsbaker (2006) report the importance of well-planned boilouts and the advantages they offer. The boilout should include careful washing of the whole system and removal of any deposits or biofilms. The chemistry should be optimized during the boilout for optimal washing and successful startup. Careful washing without considering the chemical interactions might cause many serious problems, such as excessive foaming in startup and wrong pH levels. Boilouts can significantly increase the runnability and also improve the product quality (Schwamberger and Wormsbaker, 2006) .",

They are commonly known as slimicides and are used to reduce the buildup of slime deposits within the water phase of the process. Many changes have taken place over the past 2 decades in the paper industry. Most mills have now changed from acidic sizing processing to alkaline sizing and most of the mills have closed up their processing. In these mills, the water is now recycled within the plant and not discharged. Because of this, microbial contamination has shifted in favor of bacterial strains (because of alkaline conditions) and also increased because of the continuous reintroduction of these species and food sources back into the process. Proper use of biocides and also good plant hygiene procedures are critical for maintaining effective production and low microbiological population to prevent paper failure. The types of biocides commonly used in the papermaking process are shown in Table 8 .2. The types of biocides used in the coating and additives for the papermaking process differ from the rest of the pulp and paper industry. These require longer lasting, sometimes up to 1 year's protection in storage tanks, and hence fall into the category of preservatives. The types of preservatives that are commonly encountered in the paper industry are thion, glutaraldehyde, 1,2-benzo-isothiazolin-3-one Bronopol, 1,2-dibromo-2,4-dicyanobutane, and 4,5-chloro-2-methy-4-isothiazolin-3-one.",

The oxidants-chlorine and peroxideswork directly via radical-mediated reactions to oxidize organic material (Schaechter and Lederberg, 2004; Clapp et al., 1994; Chapman, 2003; Dukan and Touati, 1996) . The electrophilic agents include organic biocides such as formaldehyde and isothiazolones and inorganic ions such as silver, copper, and mercury. These biocides react covalently with cellular nucleophiles to inactivate enzymes (Collier et al., 1990; Slawson et al., 1992) . They initiate the formation of intracellular free radicals that are responsible for their lethal action (Kimura and Nishioka, 1997; Thurman and Gerba, 1988) . Cationic membrane-active biocides such as chlorhexidine and quaternary ammonium compounds and alcohols such as phenoxyethanol destabilize membranes, which result in rapid cell lysis (Broxton et al., 1983; Chawner and Gilbert, 1989; Gilbert et al., 1977) . Weak acids, such as sorbic and benzoic acids, interfere with the ability of the cell membrane to maintain a proper pH balance that results in the accumulation of anions and cations inside the cell. Eklund (1985) reports that the inhibition of cell growth by preservatives is the result of different actions: disruption of membrane, inhibition of metabolic reactions, stress on intracellular pH, and the accumulation of toxic anions. Pyrithione is also classified as a weak protonophore (Ermolayeva and Sanders, 1995) .",

The oxidizing microbicides, such as chlorine, bromine, chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid, and ozone, can be extremely effective in destroying both the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the bacterial cells. When using oxidizing microbicides, one must be sure to obtain a sufficient residual long enough to effectively oxidize the biofilm. Unfortunately, there are mills that are overly concerned with the corrosive nature of the oxidizing microbicides and fail to apply the needed residual oxidant required to control biofilm. Low residual oxidant levels are able to significantly reduce the planktonic counts but may not be sufficient to control biofilm. The level of oxidant and duration required is found to vary from system to system. Low-level free residual oxidant will kill planktonic bacteria, yeast, mold, and protozoa. However, medium to high dosages of free residual oxidant are needed to oxidize biofilms. Algal mats particularly require high dosages of free residual oxidant. It is generally more effective to maintain a higher residual for a duration of several hours than it is to continuously maintain a low residual. Continuous low-level feed may not achieve an oxidant concentration sufficient to oxidize the polysaccharide and expose the bacteria to the oxidant. Another misunderstanding is with the use of chlorine at alkaline pH (>8.0). It is often thought that chlorine is ineffective for controlling microorganisms at elevated Based on McCoy (1983) , Schrijver and Wirth (2007) , Paulus (1993) , Kitis (2004) , Simons and da Silva (2005) , Heitz et al.

(1996) , and Kanto \u00d6qvist (2008). pH. This is not completely true. Surely, the hypohalous acid form of chlorine (HOCl) is more effective at killing cells than the hypohalite form (OCl-). However, the hypohalite is actually very effective at oxidizing the extracellular polysaccharide and the proteinaceous attachment structures. Therefore, using chlorine in alkaline cooling waters can still be tremendously effective when applied properly. This is especially true when combining chlorine with bromine or with a compatible nonoxidizing microbicide such as a polyquat. When this is done, one achieves both oxidation of the extracellular material and sufficient kill of the microorganisms. Bromine compounds, such as sodium bromide (NaBr), used to generate free residual hypobromous acid (HOBr) and organobromine biocides, are very effective oxidizing biocides. Bromine is extremely lethal to microbes, and the kinetics of the kill reactions is very quick. Certain nonoxidizing microbicides are also effective in controlling biofilm. Effective control is greatly dependent on the concentration of the product feed, frequency of addition, dosage fed, and resistance of the incumbent population to the product fed. Control cannot generally be achieved by once-a-week additions as is common in \"full-service\" applications. Typical application for effective control may include a slug addition of product two to five times a week. As with oxidizing microbicides, frequency and dosage will depend on the system conditions. It is generally most effective to alternate nonoxidizing microbicides at every addition to ensure broad spectrum control. Most nonoxidizing microbicides will have little effect in destroying the extracellular polysaccharide found in the biofilm. However, many of these microbicides may be able to penetrate and kill bacteria found within the biofilm, resulting in decreases in the population and weaknesses in the biofilm structure. Thus using the combination of nonoxidizing and oxidizing microbicides is a very effective method of controlling biofilm. When using a nonoxidizing microbicide in combination with an oxidizing agent, there should be a slight to no residual oxidant concentration present in the system at the time of addition. Sufficient time should be given for the nonoxidizing microbicide to work before resuming oxidant feed unless an oxidant compatible microbicide is being used. Using combination biocides has proven very successful in killing unwanted bacterial species. Application of synergistic biocides, in particular, can give improved biocide performance against harmful bacteria.",

            "text": "Biocides show different mechanisms of antimicrobial activity. Paulus (1993) has reported that glutaraldehyde reacts with amino and thiol groups in proteins, causing irreversible cross-links in the cellular constituents. Glutaraldehyde and oxidizing biocides are also effective against bacterial spores (Paulus, 1993) . Maillard (2002) has reported that in gram-negative bacteria glutaraldehyde interacts principally with outer components of the cells, particularly lipoproteins. High degree of cross-linking means that the cells are unable to perform their important functions, resulting in a bactericidal effect. Methylene bisthiocyanate (MBT) chelates Fe3+ ions essential for the microbial growth (McCoy, 1983) . BCDMH (1-bromo-3-chloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin) is not found to be biologically active as such, but upon hydrolysis it yields hypobromic and hypochloric acids (Kemira Chemicals Oy, 2003) . Isothiazolones (5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one in a mixture) and 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide (DBNPA) are electrophilic active compounds. These react with cytoplasmic constituents such as thiol groups of proteins, and inhibit cellular metabolism (Paulus, 1993) . Bronopol (2-bromo-2-nitro-propane-1,3-diol) also contains an active halogen group, but can also release formaldehyde (Paulus, 1993) . Dazomet (3,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-2H-tetrahydrothiadiazine-2-tion) is rapidly hydrolyzed in water to methylene isothiocyanate (Kemira Chemicals Oy, 2003) , but also releases formaldehyde (Paulus, 1993) . Biocides are usually toxic with low biological selectivity. Some biocides such has DBNPA, isothiazolone mixtures, glutaraldehyde, and MBT are also sensitizing (Kemira Chemicals Oy, 2003; Paulus, 1993; Pirttij\u00e4rvi, 2000) . Many of the presently used biocides such as peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, BCDMH, DBNPA, glutaraldehyde, or isothiazolone mixtures are reactive molecules that are quickly biodegraded to nontoxic molecules and so are not harmful for the biological wastewater treatment processes. These are also not persistent in the environment (Kemira Chemicals Oy, 2003; Paulus, 1993) .",

The level of oxidizing agent has to be checked at an adequately low level that there are no problems with the bleaching of dyes or decomposition of starch, etc. A residual of 1 ppm of active oxidizing agent in the paper machine system can be considered a possible starting level. Hydrogen peroxide, when used as a biocide, acts slower but the effect is long-lasting. So, it should be controlled at a higher level of residual activity in the system. The selection of toxic organic biocides can be made based on the temperature of the system and on the relative needs to control bacterial or fungal growth. It is common practice to use the toxic biocide on and off over periods from several minutes to several hours. By this means, a required threshold of activity can be reached and also the cost of the chemicals can be reduced. Such practices should be checked to ensure they do not cause excessive savings in first-pass retention or other problems. Some biocides contain anionic dispersants that interfere with retention. The residual level of oxidizing chemicals is mostly estimated by measuring the redox potential of the furnish. This is done with a platinum(Pt) electrode relative to a standard reference electrode.

Similar to chlorine, bromine hydrolyzes in water and produces HOBr, which has the same oxidizing power as HOCl. HOBr dissociates to form H + and OBr \u2212 , but the reaction takes place at a higher pH than chlorine. A bromine solution with a pH of 8.5 will contain close to 60% HOBr, whereas a chlorine solution at the same pH would yield 10% HOCl. In many cases, a smaller dose of bromine will obtain the same microbiological control as using chlorine in a cooling tower system. Another advantage of bromine is that it reacts with ammonia and other nitrogen compounds to form bromamines that, unlike chloramines, are effective biocides. Bromine is also less corrosive than chlorine to copper alloys. Bromine reacts with iron, manganese, sulfur, and organic matter. Heat and sunlight contribute to bromine demand, but there is less stripping because of lower volatility than chlorine. Its toxicity to aquatic life and possible formation of carcinogens is similar to chlorine and has therefore led to USEPA discharge regulations. Bromine residual can be analyzed using the same N,N\u2032-diethyl-p-phenylene-diamine colorimetric method and reagents as chlorine testing as long as other oxidants are absent. Like chlorine, bromine testing should be done at the time of sampling. If a spectrophotometer does not have a bromine program, the result given on the chlorine program can be multiplied by 2.25 to obtain a bromine concentration. It is usually unnecessary to test for free bromine residuals because most combined forms of bromine, such as bromamines, are just as effective as free bromine. If testing for free bromine is required, it should be noted that full color development by the N,N\u2032-diethyl-p-phenylene-diamine method will take 2-3 min for stabilized bromine products instead of the directed 30 s.",

A mill producing printing and writing grades from 100% deinked pulp suffered from severe wet-end breaks because of microbiological deposition. To control this deposition, various biocides were dosed to multiple points as follows: sodium hypochlorite in the pulp chest and clear filtrate; HOBr in the short-loop whitewater; several organic biocides in thick-stock feed points; and a biodispersant in the silo. Even with extensive biocide usage, the machine experienced one to two costly breaks per day. An evaluation of the new biocide was recommended to alleviate this problem.

Over the past several years, a number of oxidant products have become available in the market (Bruce, 2003; Thomas, 1999) . These products consist of halogens, bromine and/or chlorine, combined with an organic or inorganic carrier. One major advantage to combining the halogen is that it can often reduce the negative effect of the oxidant while maintaining its biocidal properties. The objective of combining a halogen with another molecule is to make halogen less aggressive but still biocidal. Bleach or chlorine gas with ammonia was mixed in the 1930s and 1940s to make chlorammonia for microbiological control in papermaking. Even though chloramine treatment was found to be more effective than chlorine, the chemistry was abandoned. The reasons for abandoning chloramine treatment were increased corrosion and increased microbiological activity resulting from the ammonia, which is a good source of nitrogen for bacteria. Later, bleach in combination with sulfamic acid (chlorosulfamate), was recommended as a biocide with low reactivity to process equipment and chemistries but the product was not successful because of the weak biocidal activity of chlorosulfamate. The various trade names often make it confusing to determine the number and nature of the products available.",

This combination includes 1-bromo-3-chlor-5,5-dimethyhydantoin, 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, and 1,3-dichloro-5-ethyl-5-methylhydantoin. This combination of hydantoins is referred as BrMEH, for bromine methylethylhydantoin. Knapick et al. (2003) found that BrMEH increases whitewater efficacy in comparison to other oxidizing alternatives. BrMEH is rapidly converted to residual nonhalogenated hydantoin and a halide ion salt. Testing has also indicated that BrMEH hydrolyzes completely in water. Other halohydantoins follow similar pathways, and their degradation products are of a similar low toxicity. BrMEH is easier to handle than liquid oxidative biocides and does not require as much labor. An extensive study of a mid-Atlantic tissue mill resulted in several process recommendations, including an extended BrMEH trial. These trials showed that BrMEH effectively controlled aerobic and sulfate-reducing bacteria and maintained machine cleanliness and product quality. The improved effectiveness of the hydantoins can be explained by the formation of a moderately bound chlorohydantoin species in equilibrium with biocidally active hypochlorite. This equilibrium stabilizes active chlorine in a relatively unreacted combined form, thus releasing biocidally active hypochlorite on demand. So, active halogen lifetime is increased and biocidal efficacy is enhanced. This phenomenon accounts for the superior field results of the product where other inorganic and organic oxidants have not performed well. When the binding affinity of halogen is increased, halogen activity and release is further reduced, but biocide efficacy is also reduced because the release of the active hypochlorite is greatly inhibited. Thus, hydantoins provide an optimum balance of reactivity reduction and hypochlorite release, resulting in a very effective water system biocide for the paper industry. Also, the potential for total organic halogens to find their way into the effluent is reduced because the requirement for applied halogen is reduced. The possibility that the finished paper product will be affected is greatly reduced because less oxidant is used and there is less potential for system metals to corrode. The reduction in corrosion potential decreases any potential effect on the Yankee dryer coating and allows the biocide to be used closer to the wet-end of the machine. The environmental fate of any biocide is a main consideration of any biocide program. A study of papermaking biocides gave halohydantoins a favorable environmental profile. This conclusion was based on the rapid detoxification of active halogen species and the low toxicity of the unhalogenated residuals.",

            "text": "Chlorine dioxide has a lower oxidation potential compared to ozone and chlorine. The optimal pH is between pH 6.0 and pH 10.0 and is generally more effective against microorganisms at pH above 8.0 than chlorine (Knapp and Bettisti, 2001) . Chlorine dioxide is converted to chlorite, the predominant end-product (50-70%), and to chlorate and chloride in water (Baribeau et al., 2002) . The major advantage of using chlorine dioxide is that it reacts less with ammonia as compared with chlorine. Though chlorine dioxide is the strong oxidizing agent, it is not very effective against established biofilms. For example, Jang et al. (2006) reported that when chlorine dioxide used at a concentration of 25 ppm, it failed to remove a biofilm thicker than 100 \u03bcm. Chlorine dioxide is used as a cellulose bleaching agent, for water disinfection at paper manufacturing plants public, and in water treatment facilities. Production of chlorine dioxide onsite can be carried out with Eka chlorine dioxide PurateR technology by Eka Chemicals Systems. Chlorine dioxide is produced from sodium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide, and sulfuric acid in Eka's SVP-PureR generator (Koepenick, 2010) . Chlorine dioxide provides broad-spectrum kill of microorganisms. Processing equipment can be kept free of slime buildups by the fast killing rates of chlorine dioxide. Slime control program using chlorine dioxide improves the quality of paper products by reducing defects such as specks, spots, and holes in the sheet. This reduces sheet breaks and avoids the subsequent production losses. Chlorine dioxide can be used for controlling odors. Chemical spot testing for chlorine dioxide at various points in the system is easily done and can be used to make adjustments in the treatment program to make up for demand changes. This allows slime control by chemical control. Most mills alternately apply several types of biocides to avoid developing resistance by certain troublesome microorganisms to a single product. This possibility is avoided with oxidizing type of chemical. It functions well over a broad pH range. This is important for the mills that operate paper machine at different pH levels, because of the different paper grades produced or because sizing changes have raised the pH in the papermaking processes. The performance of chlorine and some nonoxidizing biocides drop off in alkaline pH environment, but chlorine dioxide does not. The effective dosages of chlorine dioxide are usually low, making chlorine dioxide programs cost competitive with other biocides. Low dosage rates can result in cost reduction for effective slime control and significantly reduce the potential harmful effects to the environment from the mill effluent water. The MD Pap\u00e9is' Santista mill, located in Cubat\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, decided to switch from a monochloramine-based system. The mill produces 60,000 tons per year of printing and writing grades and flexible packaging. Because monochloramine is a persistent chemical and can be harmful to waste treatment, MD Pap\u00e9is Santista began looking for a way to reduce the toxicity of their effluent. Purate provided the level of treatment efficiency desired without the persistency problems in the effluent, and also helped with paper machine runnability.",

Food-grade paper is required to meet higher microbial standards than fine paper. Therefore, the cost of microbiological control is considerably higher than for fine paper. This is because it is difficult to inactivate bacterial spores, particularly the genus Bacillus, which survives the extreme temperatures of the dryers in the papermaking process. Chlorine dioxide has been found to be a very effective sporicide in food-grade paper applications (Bendt, 1985; Conkey, 1981) in potable water applications (Ridenour et al., 1949; Sokolova et al., 1969) , and in some food processing applications (Foegeding et al., 1986; Ito and Seeger, 1980) . Unlike chlorine, chlorine dioxide is relatively nonreactive with most of the organics found in alkaline whitewater. As a result, a large portion of the chlorine dioxide fed will be available for disinfection. Thus the bacterial activity can be effectively reduced to almost any desired level by controlling the chlorine dioxide feed rate.

Chlorine dioxide remains relatively nonreactive with the vast majority of organics, reducing the dose rate necessary to achieve effective control. Low dose rates result in typically low corrosion rates when compared to other oxidizers.

The chlorite ion (chlorine dioxide byproduct) keeps working as both a bacteriostat and slime control agent, even after the chlorine dioxide has reacted. By effectively controlling slime growth, the frequency of boilouts can be reduced and the potential for unscheduled downtime because of paper breaks can be minimized.

It is soluble in water in all proportions and in polar organic solvents. However, it is slightly soluble in aromatic solvents. Peracetic acid or PAA is the peroxide of AA. Figure 8 .8 shows the structure of PAA. It has long been used in sewage treatment and in the sugar, dairy, and brewery industries as well as for medical sterilization for renal dialysis machines. PAA is used widely for cold sterilization and disinfection. It is also effective for both drinking and wastewater treatment (Kitis, 2004; Rossi et al., 2007) . PAA-based biocides are found to be effective for controlling microbial populations in papermaking process waters (Bjorklund, 2000; Maunuksela, 1995) . Because PAA is used rather fast and does not leave any toxic residue, it can be an attractive biocide for mills that produce food-grade paperboard. Peracetic acid is rapidly tidal at low concentrations against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, molds, and algae under a wide variety of conditions. It is also effective against anaerobic and spore-forming bacteria. Peracetic acid is affective at killing biofilm microorganisms at low concentrations and short contact times. Unlike a number of other biocides, the biocidal activity of peracetic acid is not affected by pH or water hardness and biocidal activity is retained even in the presence of organic matter. For these reasons, peracetic acid is well-suited as a biocide in industrial cooling water and papermaking systems. Peracetic acid is compatible with additives commonly used in these systems. Although peracetic acid is a potent biocide, it is unique in that it does not produce toxic byproducts and its decomposition products, AA, water and oxygen, are innocuous and environmentally acceptable.

The active ingredients can be easily monitored using proprietary electro-optical measuring equipment, giving parts per million concentrations within seconds. The chemistry does have some limitations. It is found to be not much effective on organisms with thicker cell walls such as filamentous bacteria and molds.

The bactericidal effectiveness of PAA is affected by temperature and pH (Cords and Dychdala, 1993) . The presence of organic compounds adversely affects the biocidal activity of PAA. PAA is effective over a broad pH range (pH 1.0-8.0); however, the optimum antimicrobial activity occurs in acidic environment. The activity of PAA is found to decrease at pH higher than 8 (Cords and Dychdala, 1993; Sanchez-Ruiz et al., 1995) .

            "text": "Ozone (O 3 ) trioxygen, is a triatomic molecule, consisting of three oxygen atoms (Figure 8 .9) It acts as an oxidizer, much like chlorine or bromine, improving system turbidity and removing bioslime (Table 8 .12). The biocide action of ozone is a result of its reaction with the double bonds of fatty acids of the bacterial cell wall and membrane. The application of ozone results in a change in bacterial cell permeability and a leakage of cells contents into solution. The action of ozone in water is immediate and after performing its action it reverts back to oxygen. It decomposes in solution producing hydroperoxyl, hydroxyl, and superoxide radicals. The reactivity of ozone is due to strong oxidizing power of these free radicals (Kim et al., 1999) . The main advantage of ozone use consists of its superiority compared to chlorine for the main reasons that it has been reported to be 1.5 times stronger than chlorine and it is acting 3000 times faster than chlorine without producing harmful decomposition products. In 1995, ozone was declared as generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of bottled drinking water. Moreover, its generally recognized as safe Ozone is the strongest oxidant; has to be generated onsite because of short half-life Solubility depends on temperature and ozone concentration in the gas phase Reacts without residuals resulting in oxygen Ozone works without formation of undesired byproducts No formation of trihalomethanes No formation of adsorbable organic halides status was extended to food processing by experts some years later (Voidarou et al., 2007) . Because of its high reactivity, it is required only in low concentrations. Similarly to all oxidizing biocides, ozone has some disadvantages like instability and high corrosion potential. Some factors such as temperature and pH affect solubility, stability, and reactivity of ozone. The pH significantly affects the stability of ozone in aqueous solutions. Stability of ozone in solution is the greatest at pH 5.0 and decreases as pH is increased (Kim et al., 1999) . In the paper industry, ozone is mainly used for pulp bleaching, water disinfection, and as a final treatment of effluents. Korhonen and Tuhkanen (2000) found ozone to be very effective for controlling bacteria in recycled whitewater. Ozone was studied as a biocide to control microbial growth in a printing paper machine whitewater system from Stora Enso newsprint Varkaus Mills in Finland. Two samples (a cloudy discharge from a disc-filter save-all and a clear filtrate from the same save-all) were treated by ozone dose; about 80% of the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria in the disc save-all cloudy discharge and 90% removal of the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria in the clear filtrate were destroyed (Voidarou et al., 2007) . The use of ultrasound with ozone is found to be of great interest because the use of ultrasound in conjunction with biocides offers a greener alternative. Ultrasound is presently employed in several industries such as surface cleaning, medical scanning ultrasonic therapy, food and beverage technology, materials science nanosynthesis (nanotechnology), mineral processing, industrial welding, nondestructive testing, and environmental. Though the energies required for ultrasonic disinfection alone are high there is now commercial equipment available using lower powers that is often combined with ozone (Eadaoin and Timothy, 2008) . The ozonation costs are US$ 1-2/kg O 3 produced, depending on if the ozone equipment already exists. Then, a 99% destruction of the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria will cost from US$ 0.04-0.15 per m 3 whitewater treated. Ozone also functions as a micro flocculating agent to \"polish\" the water and improve clarity.",

Ozone cannot be stored or transported like other industrial gases because it rapidly decays into diatomic oxygen and should be produced onsite. Because ozone is a short-lived gas molecule that is formed when oxygen reacts with other oxygen molecules to form three parts oxygen (O 3 ). This reaction requires energy. Ozone generators form ozone by passing dry, clean air through a high-voltage electric discharge (i.e., corona discharge), creating ozone at a concentration of approximately 1%. The corona discharge method is the most common type of ozone generation; these units usually work by means of a corona discharge tube. They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone. Temperature and humidity plays a large role in how much ozone is being produced. The important parameter affecting ozone generation efficiency is the gas temperature, which is controlled by cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity. The ozone synthesis is better when the water is cooler. The lower the gas velocity, the higher the concentration, but the lower the net ozone produced. In typical industrial conditions, almost 90% of the effective power is released as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow.",

It is extensively used as an antimicrobial agent in a variety of applications such as in cooling water systems, paper-pulp industry, oil field operation, leather tanning industry, poultry industry, cosmetic field, microbiological field, food industry, and the medical area. The extensive use of this biocide is due to being noncorrosive to stainless steel, soft metals, rubber, and glass (Banner, 1995; Herbert, 1995; Lutey, 1995; Walsh et al., 1999) . Glutaraldehyde is useful in preventing the formation of slime in Lutey, 1980 all the areas of the papermaking process (Purvis and Tomlin, 1991) . Glutaraldehyde is an amber-colored liquid usually supplied in solutions of acidic pH. As with other aldehydes, the two aldehyde groups react readily under suitable conditions, particularly with proteins. It is miscible with water and having melting and boiling points \u221214 \u00b0C and 187 \u00b0C, respectively. It is found to be readily biodegradable and is effective against the aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms including sulfate-reducing bacteria. It is found to be fully compatible with commonly used wet-end additives and significantly reduces the level of microorganisms in both acidic and alkaline systems. It shows more than 90% reduction at 25 ppm and essentially complete kill at 50 ppm in ASTM (American Society for Microbiology) paper slimicide test. It considerably reduces the amount of sulfate-reducing bacteria present in the solutions at any time point Figure 8 .10 shows structure of glutaraldehyde. It achieves its biocidal activity by cross-linking the outer proteinaceous layers of the cell in such a way that cellular permeability is changed. The bacterial cell is unable to undertake most, if not all, of its essential functions. The ability of the outer covering of the cell to transport nutrients to the cell and to remove waste products from the cell is hampered and cell death results (Russell and Chopra, 1996; Simons et al., 2000) . The cell walls of all living organisms contain free amine groups (lysine and arginine) that serve as the reactive site for glutaraldehyde attack. Complex crosslinks are formed on the cell surface, and as essential cellular functions are disrupted, the cell dies. With increasing pH, more reactive sites for glutaraldehyde attack are formed, and the cidal reaction accelerates. Although glutaraldehyde kills most quickly at alkaline pH levels, it is still effective under acidic conditions. It is also effective against anaerobic bacteria, notably sulfate-reducing bacteria, because it is not inactivated by sulfide.",

As with other aldehydes, the two aldehyde groups react readily under suitable conditions, particularly with proteins (Richards and Knowles, 1968) . The ratio of monomer to polymer and type of polymer present has been the subjects of numerous publications. The dialdehyde existed as a monomer (25%) in equilibrium with the cyclic hemiacetal. It has been reported that the presence of free aldehyde groups is essential for biocidal activity. From an H-NMR study on commercial (aqueous) acid glutaraldehyde, it has been suggested that the protein cross-linking reactions are possible because of \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes (Richards and Knowles, 1968) . The pure acid glutaraldehyde underwent very rapid hydration on dissolution in water to give three hydrates in equilibrium. An acetal-like polymer similar to that suggested by Aso and Aito was also shown to exist in acid solution (Aso and Aito, 1962) . A scheme depicting glutaraldehyde polymerization in acid and alkaline solutions has been suggested by Gorman and Scott (1980) . An increase in temperature produces more free aldehyde in acid solution, whereas in alkaline solution loss of reactive aldehyde groups is possible. Progression to the higher polymeric form could occur with increased time and pH because it has been shown that there is an extensive loss of aldehyde groups from polymerization in alkaline solution (Bowes and Cater, 1966) . Therefore loss of reactive aldehyde groups could be responsible for the rapid loss of biocidal activity of alkaline solutions in storage. Increased biocidal activity in heated acid solutions can also be explained by displacement of equilibrium toward the monomer. Glutaraldehyde is an agent that acts as a protein crosslinker and is used as a biocide. It is able to bridge amino acids or H-bonds, thereby modifying the folding of the proteins and stopping its activity (Gorman and Scott, 1980) . It is thus likely to react and be consumed by wet-end additives that carry an amine function (Wolf and Sterner, 1972) . The dialdehyde reacted with 30-50% of the E-NH 2 groups in the isolated peptidoglycan and it was proposed that two tripeptide side chains could be joined when free and amino groups are available (Hughes and Thurman, 1970) . Cell wall peptidoglycan (murein, glycopeptide, mucopeptide) contains many chemical groupings capable of reaction with glutaraldehyde. The effect of lysozyme on the isolated wall peptidoglycan of Bacillus subtilis, was examined and it was found that although splitting of the lysozyme-sensitive bond occurred, glutaraldehyde-treated peptidoglycan was less sensitive than the untreated polymer to lysis by lysozyme (Hughes and Thurman, 1970) .

Table 8 .14 shows the physical properties of 50% aqueous glutaraldehyde. Glutaraldehyde-based formulations are extremely effective in controlling the growth of unwanted organisms. However, the minimal impact of glutaraldehyde on the natural environment is just as important as its biocidal efficacy. Several studies have been conducted to determine the acute toxicity of glutaraldehyde to aquatic organisms, both fresh water and marine/estuarine. In acute toxicity studies of glutaraldehyde in three aquatic species, the no observable effect concentrations ranged from 2.5 to 0.029 mg/L (algae) to 9-24 mg/L (Daphnia magna) in freshwater and marine studies, respectively. In chronic studies, the no observable effect concentrations ranged from 0.31 mg/L (algae) to 4.25 mg/L (Daphnia magna). This suggests that the environmental toxicity of glutaraldehyde does not increase significantly with repeated exposure. Glutaraldehyde belongs to the aldehydes chemical class whose properties clearly differ. Unlike formaldehyde, all available long-term animal data clearly reveal that glutaraldehyde is not carcinogenic. Several regulatory and advisory agencies have set occupational exposure limits for glutaraldehyde. Users should ensure that any exposure does not exceed the limit applicable. However, a limit as such does not prevent the use of glutaraldehydebased products in any application. Use as a high-level disinfectant on medical devices has led to cases of eye, nasal, respiratory, and skin irritation and dermal sensitization basically because of poor control of exposure following spills. In some cases, occupational asthma has been reported, although the available data do not suggest that exposure up to the limit value induces such effects. Products based on glutaraldehyde are effective against gram-positive and gramnegative bacteria, fungi, and a variety of viruses (including infectious bursal disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, hog cholera virus, human corona virus, Newcastle disease virus, avian reovirus, avian rotavirus, and strains of avian influenza virus). This wide spectrum of biocidal activity supports the many diverse applications. Tables 8.15 and 8.16 show features and limitation of glutaraldehyde, respectively.",

However, aqueous solutions of Bronopol are stable only in the cold, provided that the acidity is sufficiently high. An increase in the pH and temperature leads to decomposition of the compound. This is due to the splitting of formaldehyde. The initial process in the decomposition of Bronopol appears to be a retro-aldol reaction with the liberation of formaldehyde and the formation of bromo nitroethanol (Bryce et al., 1978) . Bromonitro ethanol itself is significantly less stable than Bronopol and in the range of conditions investigated its maximal concentration did not exceed 0.5% of the initial Bronopol concentrations. Simultaneously a second-order reaction involving Bronopol and formaldehyde occurs to give 2-hydroxymethyl-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol. The antimicrobial activity of Bronopol is mostly because of the presence of electron deficient bromine atoms in the molecules, which shows oxidation properties rather than the ability to liberate formaldehyde (Legin, 1996) . The mechanism of the antimicrobial effect of Bronopol consists of the cross-linking of sulfohydride groups of dehydrogenase enzymes occurring on the surface of microbial cells.

It provides highly effective antimicrobial activity for use in diverse and demanding industrial biocide applications, combining well-proven efficacy with important environmental safety characteristics. The main benefits of Myacide AS in the paper industry are its established performance as a slimicide active ingredient in mill process water and as an effective preservative for mill additives. The ideal physical and microbiological properties of Bronopol place it in a new generation of products, which can be seen replacing older chemistries. The product contains a minimum of 98% 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol. Bronopol is highly effective, particularly against aerobic slime-forming bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp., Bacillus spp., and the Enterobacter spp. Table 8 .18 compares the MIC of Bronopol against six key microorganisms. Figure 8 .12 shows the efficacy of Bronopol in preserving a typical paper mill additive based on calcium carbonate. The procedure used was ASTM E 723-91 at pH 7.5 with a mixed inoculum of P. aeruginosa, a second (1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one-resistant) Pseudomonas species, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella aerogenes. Myacide AS at a level of >20 ppm was able to control this mixed inoculum for 6 weeks following a single initial challenge of 106 cfu/mL and a reinoculation at 21 days. 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one at levels of up to 200 ppm active was unable to control the Pseudomonas growth.",

These biocides are marketed by Dow Chemical Company. Figures 8.13 and 8 .14 show the structures of CMIT and MIT. It is a high-performance paper mill slimicide with a broad spectrum of activity that can cope with the rapid changes in microbial flora that occur in different papermaking systems. It penetrates and kills microorganisms in the biofilm and is not inactivated by the high level of suspended organic solids found in paper mill water. It also provides cost-effective microbial control. Kathon WT has amber-gold color, is completely soluble in water, and has a mild odor and specific gravity of 1.32 at 20 \u00b0C. Kathon is stable over a wide range of conditions found in cooling water and paper mill applications. It is an extremely effective, broad-spectrum microbiocide that causes an immediate inhibition of growth on coming in contact with a microorganism. It is effective over a wide pH range and is therefore ideal for use in the alkaline conditions that exist in multicycle cooling towers and modern papermaking (Divkovic et al., 2005) . It is found to be compatible with chlorine, corrosion, and scale inhibitors and most anionic, cationic, and nonionic formulations at normal-use levels. It causes immediate inhibition of growth on coming in contact with a microorganism. The growth inhibition rapidly becomes irreversible and results in cell death. Even before death occurs, the Kathon-treated organism is unable to synthesize degradative enzymes or the exopolymers that facilitate adhesion and biofilm formation. Growth inhibition rapidly becomes irreversible and results in cell death when essential proteins are progressively oxidized. It controls the wide variety of algae, bacteria, and fungi found in industrial water systems. Such a broad-spectrum product reduces inventory and handling costs, lowers operator training expenses, and reduces the risk of dosing error. Effective control of such a wide variety of microorganisms at levels as low as 1 ppm active ingredient provides an unrivalled and cost-effective treatment. It readily penetrates the surface of adhering biofilm to give effective control of sessile microorganisms. When diluted below use concentrations, it is readily .15 presents a case history of biocide treatment in a newsprint mill where biocide addition was at the broke towers.

It can also be added to finished products as a preservative enhancer. It controls algae, bacteria, and fungal growth. DBNPA has low vapor pressure and high water solubility that makes the compound be retained mainly in the water phase. But, DBNPA has a short half-life and is rapidly degraded in water by hydrolysis. DBNPA is not an oxidizing biocide and is bromine releasing. DBNPA does act similarly to the typical halogen biocides. The liquid formulated DBNPA is an oxidizer, and the solid formulated DBNPA as a tablet is not an oxidizer. The liquid formulation is oxidizing because of the HOBr in the formulation. DBNPA readily degrades under alkaline conditions. It is sensitive to ultraviolet light and nucleophilic substances. It is uncharged and non-surface-active and it seems unlikely to interact with wet-end additives (Huber et al., 2010) . DBNPA dissolves in water, forming a relatively stable solution in an acid pH range. Its unusual solubility and stability in polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight, 200 Da) make this glycol a preferred solvent. Aqueous solutions hydrolyze under alkaline conditions with the rate of decomposition increasing with the alkalinity. However, the rate of hydrolysis is not fast enough to interfere with the antimicrobial activity of fresh, alkaline (pH 7-9.5) solutions (Wolf and Sterner, 1972) .",

The facile reaction of DBNPA with sulfur-containing nucleophiles common to microorganisms, such as glutathione or cysteine, is the basis of its mode of antimicrobial action. DBNPA is therefore not a typical oxidizing or halogen-releasing biocide. Unlike other thiol-reactive biocides, its action is such that thiol-based amino acids, like cysteine, are oxidized beyond the formation of disulfide species. This reaction irreversibly disrupts the function of cell-surface components, interrupting transport across cell membranes and inhibiting key biological functions. DBNPA degrades rapidly by both nucleophilic and hydrolytic pathways to relatively nontoxic products. The rate of hydrolysis of DBNPA is strongly pH-dependent: at pH 6.0 and 25 \u00b0C, the DBNPA molecule has a half-life of 155 h (about 6.5 days), but at pH 8.0 and 25 \u00b0C, its half-life is about 2 h. The ultimate degradation products of DBNPA are ammonia, carbon dioxide, and bromide ion. The mechanism for the environmental degradation of a DBNPA has been described by Exner et al. (1973) .

OIT exhibits excellent fungistatic and fungicidal activity against fungi, including yeasts, mold, and gram-positive bacteria, and limited activity against gram-negative bacteria. OIT also belongs to the isothiazolinone group which in general all are electrophilic molecules containing an activated N-S bond that enables them to react with nucleophilic cell entities thus exerting an antimicrobial action (Alaxender, 2002) . Figure 8 .17 shows the structure of OIT. This biocide makes use of a two-step mechanism that involves rapid growth inhibition leading to a loss of cell viability. Growth inhibition is the result of rapid disruption of the central metabolic pathways of the cell by inhibition of several specific enzymes, including dehydrogenases. The essential enzymes that are affected are associated with the nutrient metabolism, Krebs cycle, and energy generation. The main physiological activities that are rapidly inhibited in microbial cells are respiration (oxygen consumption), energy generation (ATP synthesis), and growth (assimilation). Most of these major enzymes are present in both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, which shows the broad spectrum nature of this biocide. Inhibition of cellular activity and growth is rapid within minutes. However, cell death (cidal activity) is observed after several hours of contact. Generally, the higher the concentration of biocide, the shorter the contact time needed for more complete kill. Cell death results from the progressive loss of protein thiols in the cell from one of the multiple pathways. As cell metabolism is disturbed, free radicals are produced, which also results in cell death. This exceptional mechanism results in its broad spectrum activity. ",

Dazomet, a biocide with good activity in principle, suffers in particular in products adjusted to an alkaline pH (e.g., talcum, calcium carbonate slurries) rapid degradation with release of toxic and highly odorous gases (Sismanoglu et al., 2004) . Dazomet is rapidly degraded in aqueous media to carbon disulfide, formaldehyde, and methylamine, with half-lives in the order of 3-20 days. However, in moist soil it degrades mainly to methyl isothiocyanate. It is unstable and decomposes to methylamine in water, probably via thiocarbamic acid. Multiple products are observed including methyl isocyanide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, N-methyl formamide methylamine, and carbonyl sulfide. Methyl isocyanide in turn degrades to methyl isocyanate (Ruzo, 1982) .",

Its common name is 2-bromo-4\u2032-hydroxyacetophenone and its chemical name is ethanone 2-bromo-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl). There are three products-Busan 90, 93, and 1130-containing the active ingredient bromohydroxyacetophenone. Buckman Laboratories, Inc., manufactures these three products. They are used in the control of slime-forming bacteria, deterioration/spoilage bacteria, fungi, and slime-forming fungi in paper mills and water systems. They have also been used to inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi that cause the microbiological degradation of papermaking chemicals. It is a reddish brown, viscous, odorless liquid, having a boiling point of 139.1 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b0C at 737.9 mm Hg and solubility 0.248 \u00b1 0.07 g/100 mL water. It is found to be stable under all storage conditions. At a pH 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0, BHAP has a hydrolytic half-life of 272, 250, and 173 h, respectively. Figure 8 .21 shows the structure of BHAP. It is useful for situations requiring continuous or semicontinuous dosing at low levels, such as once-through cooling systems, where the dose rate is only 1-3 mg/L. It is supplied as a 30% active biocide. The dose rate for recirculating cooling systems is typically 10-20 mg/L, but could possibly reach up to 80 mg/L in fouled systems. Considerably higher dose rates are required for algal and fungal slimes. Because BHAP is not pH-dependent, it is effective at high pH levels. However, BHAP has a relatively long half-life, typically 175-250 h, which may affect its potential for cooling system bleed discharge. Other organobromine group products with similar biocidal mechanisms include: bisbromo acetyl butene and \u03b2-bromo-\u03b2-nitrostyrene. An example of BHAP is BRM10 from Buckman Laboratories, Inc. (Frayne, 2001) . BHAP photodegrades in water with a half-life of less than 2 days. Also, BHAP's half-life in aerobic aquatic environments is 2.5 days.",

It is also used for preservation of paints, adhesives, synthetic polymer lattices, and latex emulsions; antimicrobial treatment of water-thinned products, thickeners, and slurries; preservation of wood and wood products; and preservation of leather and leather products and oil well brines and drilling mud. MBT is a yellow to light orange solid that melts at 105-107 \u00b0C. It has limited solubility in water (<1 mg/mL) but is soluble in organic solvents and therefore it is usually formulated with dispersants or supplied as a water slurry. Its molecular formula is CH 2 (SCN) 2 and molecular weight is 130. Figure 8 .22 shows the structure of MBT. It maintains long-term effects and is applicable to broad pH value and temperature ranges. MBT is pH-sensitive and rapidly hydrolyzes in the pH range above 8.0. For this reason, it is not recommended for use in systems where the recirculating water pH generally exceeds 8.0 (Mass-Diepeveen and Van Leeuwen, 1988) . Not much is known about the mechanism of MBT responsible for biocidal activity. It has been suggested that it inhibits cell respiration. Because it is a competitive microbiocide, it inactivates the electron transfer cytochromes of the microorganisms. The thiocyanate fragment of the methylene ester of the thiocyanic acid reacts to blocking the transfer of electrons in the microorganism, which results in cell death.",

In the method, at least one biocide and at least one diethanolamide are applied to a substrate or aqueous system subject to the growth of microorganisms. The diethanolamide is applied in an amount effective to increase the biocidal activity of the biocide. Biocidal compositions are described where the biocide and the diethanolamide are present in a combined amount effective to control the growth of at least one microorganism. The combination of the biocide and the diethanolamide is particularly useful as a biocide in the leather industry, the lumber industry, the papermaking industry, the textile industry, the agricultural industry, and the coating industry as well as in industrial process waters. Pereira et al. (2001) studied reduction of biofouling in paper production processes by using a carbamate-based biocide as a retention agent. This biocide was used to modify the surface properties of the microbial cells to promote their attachment to the cellulose fibers and to prevent the bacteria from developing biofilms on the equipment. About 75% of the cells were retained by the fibers. The effect of glutaraldehyde, another traditional biocide in pulp mills, was also tested and it was concluded that this biocide did not modify the surface charge of the bacteria. Contrary to the glutaraldehyde, the carbamate-based biocide modifies the surface electrical charge of the microbial cells, making them more positive. Therefore, this biocide may promote cell aggregation when the electrostatic repulsion becomes low or nonexistent (i.e., when the zeta potential is close to zero). This happens for carbamate concentrations of 100 mg/L and 200 mg/L, when the pH is 5.9, and for concentrations of 200 mg/L, when the pH is 6.7.",

PFA is a reaction product of formic acid and hydrogen peroxide, and its biocidal activity is based on active oxygen. PFA is thus halogen-free, corrosion safe, and also fully biodegradable. This highly efficient biocide improves paper machine cleanliness while also not generating any persistent adsorbable organic halide compounds in wastewater that could be harmful for the environment. PFA also leaves no biocidal residuals in the paper product, making it safe for end-users and the environment. Kemira PFA technology is currently available in Europe only. It is supplied with Kemira's proprietary monitoring methods to enable accurate dosing based on true needs (e.g., PiBa Assay). Table 8 .28 shows features and benefits of FennoClean PFA. Kurita Water Industries Japan has developed a biocide sold by the name Fuzzicide. It is produced by the reaction of two chemicals-an inorganic compound with no inherent antimicrobial activity and sodium hypochlorite. Among organic slime control agents commonly used in paper mills, current methods require raising dosing concentrations to enhance antimicrobial activity, bringing to the fore the issue of proportionate increases in environmental loads. Comparatively, newly released Fuzzicide is an innovative slime control agent with high resistance to bacteria, fungi, and yeast, assuring eco-friendliness and safety. This agent has been verified to have no effect on papermaking chemicals such as dyes. Kurita Water Industries has taken the initiative in incorporating Fuzzicide into approximately 40 machines centering on fine paper for 5 years since receiving its dealership in Japan from AY Labs, an Israeli venture firm. The benefits of Fuzzicide have since been substantiated. The company further aims to expand the use of Fuzzicide in neutral-pH paper machines-such as paperboard and newsprint machines that require slime control because of changes in paper types-in addition to fine paper machines. Fuzzicide features include availability in intended water systems with high organic matter content, low metal corrosivity, and no generation of toxic waste such as trihalomethane. Fuzzicide is not supplied in containers because of easy degradation and a lack of long-term stability. It requires the installation of dedicated dosing equipment near the intended system, and the agent can be added while being constantly generated in the equipment. The dosing equipment is outfitted with a computer to control the proportions and reactions of the above two chemicals when forming Fuzzicide and to add it in appropriate quantities. Sodium hypochlorite is commonly used for sterilizing tap water. However, it tends to assign priority to dissolved organic matter rather than reacting to bacteria. Thus it is seldom used in papermaking, a process with significant dissolved organic matter that decreases antimicrobial activity. Table 8 .29 shows key features of Fuzzicide.",

After optimization, the mill reported: spore counts in the finished paper reduced to low levels vital in food-packaging grades (average of more than 90% reduction); total aerobic microbial counts reduced to levels below mill goals (Figure 8 .23); no taints, taste, or residual biocide in the final paper; improved production by 393 tons/month a cleaner machine; and improved production and provided a high-quality product. The mill also enjoyed an 854% return on investment. Another mill running under alkaline conditions at 1200 m/min producing 1440 tons/day of coated wood-free paper was experiencing runnability problems because of slime buildup at the wet-end. The paper machine was using a nonoxidizing deposit control program based on MBT, DBNPA, and glutaraldehyde. The mill's fresh water was not microbiologically treated. A paper machine system survey (BioAudit) was conducted, including: understanding of system flows and volumes; system pH, temperature and oxidation-reduction potential measurements; plating studies to understand the system's microbial population; TRA-CIDE toxicity and bioactivity studies to find the best deposit control program. A program was proposed to the mill combining a nonhalogenated oxidant with a nonoxidizing biocide (Simons et al., 2003) . The fresh water was brominated with Ondeo Nalco's ACTI-BROM to improve the control of filamentous bacteria and other microorganisms that mainly enter through this route.

(2005) report two major approaches to develop effective enzyme products for application in the paper industry. The first approach involves directly identifying the polysaccharides present in the slime and looking for specific enzymes able to degrade them. An example of this case is levan, which is produced by several species of Bacillus and Pseudomonas bacteria that can grow in paper machines, especially those manufacturing fine paper, where the level of inhibiting compounds is low. The enzyme levan hydrolase hydrolyzes levan to low-molecular-weight polymers that are water-soluble and therefore clean the slime out of the system. Another case where it was applied is a family of products called Darazyme, developed by Grace Dearborn's group; this work was based on the preliminary identification of slime components and the subsequent application of specific enzymes or combination of enzymes depending on the polysaccharides found (Bajpai, 1999) . The other approach is indirectly testing to identify enzymes that show activity on the biofilm by studying their effects on slime development. The specificity in the way enzymes interact with the biofilm makes this a complex technique, being somewhat difficult to identify enzymes that are effective against different types of slimes. According to Simoes et al. (2010) , formulations containing several types of enzymes seem to be fundamental when it comes to applying this slime control approach successfully.",

            "text": "The use of enzymes in the control of microbiological slime deposits has proved useful under modern mill conditions (Hatcher, 1983; Wollenweber, 1992, 1993) . EDC-I (enzymatic deposit control) is an enzyme patented by Economics Laboratory (Hatcher, 1973) that hydrolyzes and depolymerizes the fructose polysaccharide levan, which has been identified in paper mill slime (Colasurdo and Wilton, 1988) . The product is environmentally safe and has no effect on the operation of activated sludge effluent plants. EDC-I has been successfully applied in systems with wide range of temperature and pH. It is used by paper mills in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, Japan, and the United States. Applications have been on machines producing writing and printing, fine paper grades, and paperboards. This enzyme is produced during an aerobic fermentation of a common nonpathogenic, non-spore-forming soil bacterium. Personal safety is greatly enhanced through the use of an enzyme product rather than conventional toxic biocides. The enzyme is nontoxic, does not release dangerous fumes and is not corrosive and also does not require any special handling. Spills can be flushed away with water. The exact period for which the enzyme is stable depends on a number of factors peculiar to any paper machine system, including the temperature and pH profiles as well as any other additive. Leroy et al. (2008) and Molobela et al. (2010) have reported that proteases, and particularly serine proteases, are most efficient in removing Pseudoalteromonas and Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms. Lequette et al. (2010) showed that serine proteases were efficient in removing Bacillus cereus biofilms, whereas glycosidases were efficient on P. fluorescens biofilms when used as a mix of \u03b1-and \u03b2-polysaccharidases. Marcato-Romain et al. (2012) characterized biofilms from the paper industry and evaluated the effectiveness of enzymatic treatments in reducing them. The EPS extracted from six industrial biofilms were studied. EPS were mainly proteins, the protein to polysaccharide ratio ranged from 1.3 to 8.6 depending on where the sampling point was situated in the papermaking process. Eight hydrolytic enzymes were screened on a 24-h multispecies biofilm. The enzymes were tested at various concentrations and contact durations. Glycosidases and lipases were inefficient or only slightly efficient for biofilm reduction, whereas proteases were more efficient: after treatment for 24 h with pepsin, Alcalase1, or Savinase1, the removal exceeded 80%. Savinase1 was tested on an industrial biofilm sample. This enzyme led to a significant release of proteins from the EPS matrix, indicating its potential efficiency on an industrial scale. Torres et al. (2011) studied the effectiveness of 17 commercial enzymatic products on biofilm formed by the flora present in the process water obtained in the sheet forming zone of the wire section from a 100% recycling paper mill using mixed recovered paper as raw material and producing paper for board. The results showed that Pectinex Smash and its fraction Novoshape were the best formulations in the prevention of biofilm formation . Pectinex Smash \u00ae has a mixture of pectinolitic activities and Novoshape is an enzymatic solution of a microbial pectin methylesterase. The gene encoding of the esterase enzyme is derived from fungus Abdopus aculeatus and is transferred into a strain of the food grade organism Aspergillus oryzae for commercial production. The Novoshape preparation has a declared activity of 10 PEU/mL and an optimal temperature of 50 \u00b0C. This enzyme belongs to the carbohydrate esterase family, catalyzes the hydrolysis of methyl ester groups, and has high specificity for pectin substrates, a property widely used in food industry and in plant science.",

(1989) reported that in all cases, the combination treatment resulted in significantly greater population reduction compared with the use of biocide alone at the same concentration. The enzyme alone showed no effects. Further, it was shown that on application of enzyme (0.10 kg/metric ton) on machines producing printing grade paper, the biocide concentration could be reduced from 0.15 to 0.02 kg/metric ton (Ferris et al., 1989) . The amount of biocide was reduced to \u223c15% of what had been used before using the enzyme. Hatcher (1983) also achieved a similar level of reduction in biocide concentration in the whitewater system of a paper mill when an enzyme preparation was used. Patterson (1986) has reported that with the use of enzyme, the concentration of biocide may be reduced by 50% and slime breaks are reduced from three per day to three per month. Colasurdo and Wilton (1988) reported that with the use of an enzyme preparation at Sonoco Products Co., Hartsville, Georgia, the slime breaks were almost eliminated which resulted in increased productivity. The Levanase enzyme produced by Rhodotorula sp. has been found to reduce the required biocide concentration by 25% without negatively affecting the paper properties (Chaudhary, 1992; Chaudhary et al., 1998) . In spite of the strong indications that exopolysaccharides are involved in adhesion, enzyme treatment has shown that proteases are more effective than carbohydrate-degrading enzymes in removing bacteria from surfaces.",

In microorganisms, the cell walls contain substances like cellulose, chitin, mucopeptide, and \u03b2-1,3glucan. In addition to these, many microorganisms have capsules, slime layers, or other surface components, which are polysaccharides or proteins attached to the outside of the rigid layer conferring additional rigidity and/or protection. There are enzymes which will attack all of these polymers. The use of lytic enzymes with gluconase and protease activity in paper machine process water to kill microorganisms causing precipitates and/or forming slime and/ or adversely affecting product quality, has been promoted. Enzymatic dispersion of biological slimes has been studied with pentosanase-hexosanase enzyme, Rhodozyme HP-150. This enzyme is especially effective in treating industrial waters used in the operation of cooling towers to disperse slimes and slime-forming masses within such waters to prevent the deposit of such slimes on the heat exchange surfaces of cooling towers and surface associated with such units. In his patent, Orndorff (1983) has described a method of killing and inhibiting the growth of microorganisms in industrial process streams using peroxidase-or lacasse-catalyzed oxidation of various phenolic compounds to generate microbial oxidation products (e.g., poisonous quinines).",

A coordinated chemical deposit-control program was supplemented by cleaning programs focused on difficult to reach areas that were suspected as possible contributors to breaks. The big breakthrough in starch system cleaning has been the introduction of enzyme-cleaning products. The enzyme used is amylase, an enzyme that breaks down the starch deposits and thus allowing them to be easily washed away. The enzyme is so powerful and persistent that it is necessary to deactivate the enzyme with hypochlorite or peroxide after the cleaning. The Dryden mill has used the starch enzymatic cleaner for the past few years with very good success. In the early enzymatic starch cleanings, the system was found to have leaks after the enzyme boilout. Starch deposits that had plugged the leaks were completely cleaned away. In addition to the enzymatic cleaning, regular caustic cleanings of the system were done. These were found to be effective but do not match the enzyme cleaning. The size press area itself is cleaned with hot water.",

Steve patented a method that implemented plant dehydrogenase enzymes such as peroxidase and laccase to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms in industrial processes (Steve, 1983) .

A new group of biocides based on the cell wall lytic enzymes obtained from microorganisms, such as \u03b2-1,3-glucanases, chitinases, and proteases, attack bacterial, fungal, and yeast cell walls (Stepnaya et al., 2008; Shastry and Prasad, 2005; Bar-Shimon et al., 2004; Nagaraj Kumar et al., 2004; Brito et al., 1989) . Tables 8.32-8.34 show the results of applying the new enzymatic biocide at pulp and paper mills (Cotrino and Ordonez, 2011) . Klahre et al. (1998) , however, report poor performance of enzymes alone in antifouling efforts in paper mills, particularly in long-term applications. The enzymes themselves are rapidly degraded by extracellular proteases. Brisou (1995) already showed that there were a vast variety of target structures that enzymes had to interact with, indicating that there is no single enzyme or enzyme mixture to effectively remove biofilms.",

Basically, proteases, and polysaccharide hydrolyzing enzymes may be useful (Meyer, 2003) . Moreover, the use of enzymes in biofilm control is still limited because of the low prices of the chemicals used today compared with the costs of the enzymes. In fact, the technology and production of these enzymes and the enzyme-based detergents are mostly patent-protected. Moreover, the low commercial accessibility of different enzyme activities limits their current usage (Johansen et al., 1997) . Orgaz et al. (2006) in their study on biofilm removal, concluded that on biofilm removal of P. fluorescens, the enzyme pectin esterase produced by Trichoderma viride (which belongs to the same family as pectinase methylesterase), could possibly deacetylate a polysaccharide in the biofilm matrix, making it softer and possibly more porous (Orgaz et al., 2006 (Orgaz et al., , 2007 . Many microbial EPS have different substituent groups as ketal-linked pyruvate or ester-linked acetyl groups. The removal of acyl groups, especially the acetate, can significantly affect the physical properties of polysaccharides. The removal of one of the substituents such as the acetyl group, in particular the acetate, influences the physical properties of EPS (Sutherland, 1999) . Several fungi can degrade complex plant cell-wall material, by secreting a large variety of enzymes. This versatility makes commercial polysaccharide-degrading enzyme mixtures have a widespread use in multiple fields, such as fruit processing (McKay, 1993) or wastewater treatment (Wesenberg et al., 2003) . They could also be used to degrade bacterial biofilm matrices or prevent and control the formation of biofilm in the piping system of the paper mill wastewater. Because of the EPS heterogeneity, a mixture of enzymes might be necessary for efficient biofilm degradation.",

In this process, nontoxic, modified lignosulfonates are used with specific components that are chelating agent different from those generally used in papermaking. The lignosulfonate is water soluble. With controlled bacterial activity, efficient system cleaning and the reduction of chemical deposits is obtained. This process maintains the organisms and the suspended matter in the whitewater in a colloidal state and prevents the bacteria from forming deposits and agglomerating. The bacteria adheres to the modified lignosulfonate. It carries a net negative charge. The material becomes more flocculent as the bacteria digest the organic substances in the colloids. The lignosulfonate is drained off on the wire press and the bacteria enter the finished paper. Counterindications are open water systems, use of recycled fibers, unbleached kraft pulp, and an increase in the organic matter (Oberkofler, 1987 (Oberkofler, , 1989 (Oberkofler, , 1992 Oberkofler and Braunsperger, 1994; Braunsperger et al., 1996) .",

The use of biodispersants offers an ecologically attractive method of controlling slime in the pulp and paper industry. They eliminate or reduce the needs for biocides (Anstey et al., 1998a; Schulte, 1997, 1999; Gould, 1998 Gould, , 2001 Pauly, 2001; Robertson and Taylor, 1994; Saner, 1998; Stenqvist, 1992; Van Haute, 1997a,b; Van Haute, 1999; Weisshuhn et al., 2000; Wright, 1997; Schenker, 1996) . These are nonbiocidal surface-active agents that penetrate and loosen the biopolymer matrix. This not only aids in sloughing the biofilm, but will also expose the microorganisms to the microbicides. They can be continuously applied or periodically slug-dosed. Because these products effectively mobilize solids, they can cause clogging in downstream and down-gradient locations, and this potential must be taken into account when designing proper application. Biodispersants are particularly effective when dealing with systems that have a high total organic carbon loading and a tendency to foul. These products are typically fed in slug additions before microbicide feed. Low-level continuous feed may also be effective. However, in some cases, this may not be as effective because it may not reach a certain threshold amount required to produce the desired effect. Developments in biodispersant technology are making this approach more effective and popular than ever before. This technology is based on nonionic polymers, which are nontoxic, nonfoaming, colorless, and free of organic solvents. Because of their nonionic character, they will not increase the system anionicity and also not interfere with other papermaking chemicals. Table 8 .38 shows biodispersants used in the paper industry.",

The increased negative charge of the particle surfaces increases the electrostatic potential energy barrier and reduces contact with the surfaces because the bacteria are negatively charged. To be effective, the amount of dispersant must be sufficient to overpower any coagulants that may be present (e.g., aluminum sulfate, high-density cationic polymers). There are some problems with the use of dispersants. These products effectively mobilize solids but they can cause clogging in downstream and down-gradient locations; therefore, this potential must be considered when designing an appropriate application that will not lead to an uncontrolled accumulation of dispersed materials in a paper production system. Particularly cationic retention aids tend to be deactivated by dispersants. However, in some cases, dispersants have helped papermakers overcome specific deposit problems (Hubbe et al., 2006) . Under some circumstances, slime deposits may be responsible for up to 70% of all breakages, blockages, and pump failures in pulp and papers mills (Safade, 1988) .",

The recommended program involved the continuous application of a biodispersant while reducing feeding frequency of the same nonoxidizing biocides used previously by the mill. After optimization, the mill reported reduced nonoxidizing biocide use by 60%, fewer deposits on the paper machine, sheet breaks reduced from an average of 5.8-2.6 breaks per day, and deposit control program costs reduced by 20%. This demonstrates that selected dispersants can significantly reduce the amount of nonoxidizing biocides needed to obtain good slime control in a cost-effective manner. Poor microbial deposit control is the main cause of poor paper machine runnability and loss of efficiency. The use of new monitoring tools allows mills to optimize slime control programs to achieve the best performance in a cost-effective way. The use of traditional toxic nonoxidizing biocides can be significantly reduced by the use of new nonhalogenated oxidants in combination with new nontoxic deposit control agents. An optimized microbial deposit control program can give papermakers a high return on investment, because program costs can be offset by improved runnability, decreased rejects, and reduced biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the final effluent.",

The penetrating action of the cleaner exposes the microorganisms growing there to the effects of the microbicide being used.

By leaving a bare metal surface, it also allows the corrosion inhibitor to reestablish protection. The biofilm cleaner should be slug-fed to a point in the system where good mixing is obtained. Addition should be made 30 min to 1 h before biocide addition. The level of cleaner required will be dependent on the amount of biofilm present.

The question arises about how this is possible given the specific mode of action of enzymes. This appears logical, if the majority of the machine system deposits are microbiological slime. A protease breaks down these deposits. But in a system that has deposits containing various fiber, fillers, and hydrolyzed additives, how does the protease enzyme work? Actually, most deposits in the paper machine system have microbiological growth in, on, and around the deposit. When the enzyme breaks down this matrix, the deposit sloughs off and is carried away in the boilout solution. This is based on the ability of bioengineered enzymatics to attack specific deposits by eating the organisms that compose them, making them easy to rinse away. There are certain pH-neutral additives that can be added to help in penetrating, breaking down, and removing deposits that are nonmicrobiological in nature. These additives in fact help the protease-based enzyme product enter into the deposit where microbiological growth is helping to anchor and hold a deposit together. This is a cleaning effect and is found to be better than caustic boilouts.",

The additives may be introduced along with the bacteria, thus favoring their growth. These additives include tensides to avoid the adhesion of bacteria, lignosulfonate to increase the nutrients, and enzymes to catalyze the breakdown of organic substances. It has been also suggested aeration of the circulating water with oxygen or air or the addition of oxygen releasing compounds such as hydrogen peroxide. The invention is not limited to bacteria, but the fungi alone or the mixture of fungi and bacteria can also be used. The patent describes an indiscriminate use of bacteria and fungi, of which the mixed culture of freeze-dried bacteria used contains genera associated with slime formation in pulp and paper mills but also contains such genera undesirable for paper and board intended to come into contact with food stuffs. Plant-scale trials showed that the addition of the selected microbes to the circulating water reduced the buildup of slime on solid surfaces and in the liquid phase.",

Sulfosuccinates, a family of molecules, are very effective in inhibiting deposit formation (Davis et al., 1999; Scharpf, 1998; Schenker et al., 1998 ). An exclusively designed sulfosuccinate molecule is found to act at an earlier stage than biodispersants and enzymes in the inhibition of biofilm deposit formation. The mechanism of biofilm inhibitors differs from that of biodispersants and enzymes in that bacterial attachment and biofilm formation is prevented by hindering the formation of a concentrated extracellular EPS layer around a bacterial cell. Bacteria lacking EPS have less capability to permanently attach to surfaces, cannot easily protect themselves from the harmful effects of microbicides, and do not provide \"glue\" to hold wet-end deposits together. Thus, in the idealized model of biofilm formation, sulfosuccinate works in stage 2, actually preventing the bacteria from forming an intact EPS matrix. The cells are then only loosely associated with the surface. Because of the absence of the concentrated EPS layer around the bacterial cell, sulfosuccinates are described as biofilm inhibitors to distinguish them from microbicides, biodispersants, and enzyme.",

Before running any of the field trials, lithium tracer studies were conducted from which the system cycle-up was determined and the product application rates were accordingly determined. The control data from a European trial location reflect deposition on a machine with a conventional proprietary microbicide (dodecylguanidine hydrochloride and methylene bis (thiocyanate) and biodispersant in the short loop whitewater and a conventional proprietary microbicide (Bronopol and quaternary ammonium chloride) in the save-all. The control consisted of the paper machine running with a commercial biocide program. The treated system received a program consisting of the biofilm inhibitor. This conventional program was found to be effective at keeping the machine clean and providing the mill with a desired 4-week interval between boilouts. The microbicide and biodispersant feeding the short loop were completely replaced with a biofilm inhibitor program on an equal cost per ton basis. A side-stream monitoring device was used to measure visual appearance of the biofilm and the growth of certain biofilm constituents over a 2-week period. Both measurements showed a significant decrease in biofilm growth with the biofilm inhibitor program. Over an 11-month period, testing on this fine paper machine trial indicated that the biofilm inhibitor program reduced the number of breaks by 40%.",

Results showed that, for the specific paper machine, continuous feed is preferential over semicontinuous. The trial consisted of various production runs with boilouts in between runs. Olofsson et al. (2003) reported that N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) may be an interesting candidate for use as an agent to reduce and prevent biofilm formation on stainless steel surfaces in environments typical of paper mill plants. Using 10 different bacterial strains isolated from a paper mill, the researchers found that the mode of action of NAC is chemical as well as biological in the case of bacterial adhesion to stainless steel surfaces. The initial adhesion of bacteria is dependent on the wettability of the substratum. NAC was shown to bind to stainless steel, increasing the wettability of the surface. Moreover, NAC decreased bacterial adhesion and even detached bacteria that were adhering to stainless steel surfaces. Growth of various bacteria, as monocultures or in a multispecies community, was inhibited at different concentrations of NAC. No detectable degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by NAC was found, showing that NAC reduced the production of EPS, in most bacteria tested, even at concentrations at which growth was not affected. Altogether, the presence of NAC changes the texture of the biofilm formed and makes NAC an interesting candidate for use as a general inhibitor of formation of bacterial biofilms on stainless steel surfaces.",

Biosurfactants produced by Lactococcus lactis-impaired biofilm formation on silicone rubber (Rodrigues et al., 2004) . The ability of biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium L. lactis 53 to inhibit adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements. Water contact angles indicated that the silicone-rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (48\u00b0) than bare silicone rubber (109\u00b0). The results showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates of Staphylococcus epidermidis GB 9/6 from 2100 to 220 microorganisms cm(\u22122) s(\u22121), Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 from 1560 to 137 microorganisms cm(\u22122) s(\u22121), and S. aureus GB 2/1 from 1255 to 135 microorganisms cm(\u22122) s(\u22121), allowing for a 90% reduction of the deposition rates. The deposition rates of Rothia dentocariosa GBJ 52/2B, C. albicans GBJ 13/4A, and Candida tropicalis GB 9/9 were far less reduced in the presence of the biosurfactant compared with the other strains.",

Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and may provide a natural, highly specific, nontoxic, feasible approach for controlling several microorganisms involved in biofilm formation (Kudva et al., 1999; Duckworth, 1976) . Bacterial viruses or bacteriophages (phages) are hypothesized to be the predominant lifeform in the biosphere, clearly outnumbering their host bacterium. Bacterial viruses were discovered about 100 years ago (d 'H\u00e9relle, 1922; Hauduroy, 1925) and their discovery is attributed to F\u00e9lix d'H\u00e9relle, a French-Canadian microbiologist and Frederick Twort, an English bacteriologist (Twort, 1915; d'H\u00e9relle, 1917) . d'H\u00e9relle named these viruses as \"bacteriophages\" from the words \"bacteria\" and \"phagein,\" which in Greek means to eat or devour. d'H\u00e9relle performed extensive trials in humans and animals (Barrow and Soothill, 1997) and tried to shed a light on their nature and ability to function as therapeutic agents (d 'H\u00e9relle, 1922 'H\u00e9relle, , 1917 (Straub and Applebaum, 1993; Sulakvelidze et al., 2001; Summers, 1999) . Twenty years after the official finding of phages, the first antibiotic, penicillin, was discovered. This fact, allied with some early clinical failures (Eaton and Bayne-Jones, 1934 ) and theoretical concerns did not continue with the phage therapy in the United States and most of the Western Europe. However, research and therapeutic use of phages continued in the Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union (Alisky et al., 1998; Chanishvili et al., 2002; Slopek et al., 1987; Weber-Dabrowska et al., 2000) . In these countries, phages continued to be regarded as a good treatment method against a wide range of bacterial infectious diseases (Sulakvelidze et al., 2001; Ho, 2001) .",

The infection of biofilm cells by phages is extremely conditioned by their chemical composition and the environmental factors, such as temperature, growth stage, media, and phage concentration (Chaignon et al., 2007; Sillankorva et al., 2004) . The major advantage of using phages in combating bacteria is their bactericidal (killing) nature, selectivity, and nontoxicity to man and the environment. The main drawback is that the phages have to be isolated for each harmful bacterium, the type of which may vary between paper mills. When phages make contact with biofilms, further interactions take place, depending on the susceptibility of the biofilm cells to the phage and to the accessibility of the receptor sites. The integrity of the biofilm may be quickly destroyed if the phage also contains polysaccharide-degrading enzymes or if significant cell lysis is affected by the phage. These microbes are noted for their high activity in the presence of host cells and selective lytic action. But, the industrial application of this technique has been slow. Viruses lack an independent metabolism and multiply only inside the living cells, using the metabolic machinery of the host cells. A bacteriophage can propagate only by coming into contact with its specific host bacterium. When this happens, the phage lyses the bacterium completely. Some of the bacteriophages that attack E. coli (\u03c8, \u03bb, and T-4 phage) are very well known for their extensive contribution to development in molecular biology. The bacteriophage contains an icosahedral head of 50-100 nm in diameter, a long tail of about 100 nm in length with or without a sheath around it and six tail fibers at the end of its tail. The bacteriophage contains only protein with nucleic acid as gene. The bacteriophage selectively attacks its particular host bacterium. The gene of the bacteriophage is placed into the host bacterium, where it multiplies. The host cells also begin to produce the specific protein which constitutes the bacteriophage. A large number of bacteriophages are formed in the host cell, when the phages are released from the host, the cycle begins once again. The bacteriophage formed in the host cell has the same properties and morphology as the original. The reproduced phages thus can constantly lyse the same host bacteria. The number of bacteriophages formed after one lytic cycle is called \"burst size\" and the time required for the cycle is called latent period. These values are reported for evaluating the activity of bacteriophage.",

Dispersion by induction of a prophage, followed by cell death and subsequent cell cluster disaggregation has been observed by Webb et al. (2003) . However, phage enzymes are very specific and rarely act on more than a few closely related polysaccharide structures. Phages and bacteria can coexist symbiotically within biofilms, suggesting that they would make poor tools for the control of biofilm formation. Combinations of phage enzymes and disinfectants have been recommended as possible control strategies under certain conditions (Tait et al., 2002) with the phage added before addition of disinfectant being more effective than either of these alone. Mixtures of enzymes are commonly used, composed on arbitrary base. Japanese researchers conducted investigations using Pseudomonas sp. (S\u22121) and its corresponding bacteriophage (pS\u22121) (Araki and Hosomi, 1990) . The growth of slime-forming bacteria was inhibited in the presence of its corresponding bacteriophage. Results with bacteriophage and conventional biocides showed that after addition of 10 ppm of MBT to the test solution, the colony count of the slime-forming bacteria increased from 87 \u00d7 10 5 cfu/mL to 110 \u00d7 10 5 cfu/mL after 24 h at 28 \u00b0C showing that MBT was effective in keeping the activity of the slime-forming bacteria to a low level. However, the simultaneous addition of MBT and bacteriophage PS-1 reduced the colony count of the slime-forming bacteria from 100 \u00d7 10 5 cfu/mL to 2.4 \u00d7 10 5 cfu/mL. Results showed that addition of bacteriophage to mill whitewater was an effective technique for slime control and addition of bacteriophage with conventional biocides was also effective. Practical application of this technique on a commercial scale awaits completion of fundamental studies in several key areas. Bacteriophages will not impair the activity of the sludge used in waste treatment systems unlike conventional biocides.",

            "text": "Vaatanen and Harjy-Jeanty in 1986 reported the use of bacteriophages in paper mill whitewater systems. Their concept was based on the idea of isolating harmful bacterial streams of process waters and thereafter searching for virulent, lytic bacteriophage for these bacteria. They studied bacteriophages lytic for the bacteria Enterobacter and Klebsiella in model systems and found that phage activity against Enterobacter agglomerans stopped its growth for more than 19 h. When K. pneumoniae was dosed with phage at 3-h intervals, bacterial growth was no more restricted than when the culture was injected only at the beginning of the test. It was concluded that further studies to determine the efficacy of bacterial control in process waters should take into consideration the expected development of bacterial resistance to phage attack and the variation in bacterial strains among paper mills. Sharma et al. (2005) observed the synergistic effect of an alkaline cleaner and a bacteriophage in the inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 biofilms formed on stainless steel. Lu and Collins (2007) engineered a bacteriophage to express a biofilm degrading enzyme. This enzymatic phage was found to have the ability to attack the bacterial cells in the biofilm and the biofilm matrix, considerably reducing the biofilm cell counts; more than 99.9% of removal was achieved. Hughes et al. (1998a) working on the control of E. agglomerans biofilms by the use of phages observed that the cells were killed and the biofilms were degraded by the bacteriophage. The phage then lysed the biofilm cells and the polysaccharide polymerase enzyme degraded the EPS and caused biofilm to slough off. Sillankorva et al. (2004) used bacteriophages to remove P. fluorescens cells, showing that phages were effective in the removal of biofilms in the early stage of development and 5-day-old biofilms under optimal conditions; up to 80% biofilm removal was obtained. Hanlon et al. (2001) have reported that in P. aeruginosa biofilms the bacteriophage migration through the biofilms is facilitated by the reduction in alginate viscosity. This phenomenon is related to the exopolysaccharide degradation by enzymes produced by the bacterial host. Hibma et al. (1997) reported that a bacteriophage (L. monocytogenes phage ATCC 23074-B1) was used successfully in L. monocytogenes biofilm inactivation. E. coli biofilms have been shown to be susceptible to bacteriophage T4 (Doolittle et al., 1995) .",

The redox potential of these solution is between +800 and +1200 mV; pH ranges from 2 to 5 (Cloete et al., 2009; Thorn et al., 2012) . Electrochemically produced biocides can be obtained using other salts, such as potassium chloride and magnesium chloride. These solutions have been extensively used in many industries. The primary oxidant is chlorine, produced from electrolysis of the salts in the aqueous media (Thorn et al., 2012; Buck et al., 2002) . The next candidate used to make ECAS in the halogen series is bromine. It is an effective biological control agent. It rapidly degrades to harmless bromide. Therefore, it is not a persistent pollutant. Bromine is produced by electrolysis of a nonhazardous aqueous solution of NaBr and chloride. The electrolytic bromine can completely replace hazardous/toxic chemical biocides for the control of microorganisms in cooling towers (Timothy, 2007) . Anaerobic bacteria are more sensitive to oxidizing compounds in comparison to aerobic bacteria, and therefore electrochemically generated biocides are powerful antianaerobes. Bacterial spores are highly resistant to many traditional organic biocides, whereas these ECAS have been effective against a number of pathogens, including Bacillus atrophaeus, B. cereus, Bacillus anthracis, human norovirus, hepatitis B virus, HIV, Aspergillus flavus, C. albicans, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium difficile, Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, and staphylococcal enterotoxin (Venczel et al., 1997; Shetty et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2000; Rogers et al., 2006; Park et al., 2007; Tagawa et al., 2000; Xiong et al., 2010; Morita et al., 2000; Zeng et al., 2011; Buck et al., 2002; Holcomb et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2010; Raad and Sherertz, 2001) .",

            "text": "In a study by Gareth et al. (2013) , acidic ECAS were stored at temperatures of 4 and 20 \u00b0C for 398 days to examine the changes in the free chloride content, pH, oxidation-reduction potential, and antimicrobial activity. The results showed a faster degradation at the higher temperature than at the lower temperature, with a concomitant decline in bactericidal capacity, whereas the pH did not change. The use of high concentrations of biocides can be avoided by adding greener biocide enhancers, such as ethylenediamine disuccinate (EDDS); its usage in the laboratory allowed the application of less glutaraldehyde to the test biofilms formed by sulfate-reducing bacteria. EDDS, which is a biodegradable chelator, increases the effectiveness of glutaraldehyde in its treatment of sulfate-reducing bacteria biofilms. This concept was initially used by Raad and Sherertz (2001) to treat biofilms on catheters (Raad et al., 2003 (Raad et al., , 2007 but with the new concept of green materials, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was a noncompatible molecule because of its slow biodegradability, and it was replaced with environmentally compatible chelating agents. The activity of biocides such as THPS can be increased by the use of EDDS. Eversdijk et al. (2012) designed a biocide controlled-release system that consisted of modified nanoclay particles incorporated with different model biocides, and studied their release and antifungal activities under different environmental conditions. This composite strategy allowed the production of a tunable system to control the release rate and extend its effectiveness to 45 days during an artificially generated rain test. This approach appears promising for the prolonged protection of different construction materials and waterborne paints. Routine coatings last for an average of half a year or a maximum of 2 years, whereas the desired service life in buildings is at least 10 years. The effect of a controlled-release system on biocide concentrations over time was studied. Increasing the dose of a biocide was found to result in a minor prolongation of protection, but increased in-house environmental pollution. To meet the challenges to material performance and environmental safety, such durable composite materials are a beam of hope for safer green applications (BPD, Directive 98/8/EC, 2012). Egu\u0131a and Trueba (2007) applied marine biotechnology to produce environmentally benign water-based coatings using lower-toxicity elements and bacteria isolated from surfaces immersed in marine water. These promising coatings were able to reduce the problem of biofouling while having no adverse effects on the surrounding environment.",

            "text": "Onsite-generated biocides also eliminate the storage and transportation of biocides and provide a basis for building a new control program. These electrochemically generated biocides are fast-acting, powerful biocide agents, used during all stages of disinfection and cleaning, applied in liquid, aerosol or frozen forms, chemical residue-free, generated onsite or in concentrated amounts for imminent use, eliminating handling and storage issues, and produced from municipal tap water and salt. Flores et al. (2013) studied the ability of citrate-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to stop the formation of bacterial biofilms by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. These are clinically important gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. They used two different approaches. The first approach involved the dispersal of AgNPs to study the bactericidal effect on planktonic bacteria, whereas the second approach was to adsorb AgNPs on a titanium substrate to test their bactericidal effect on sessile bacteria. Planktonic P. aeruginosa was found to be more susceptible to nanoparticles than was S. aureus, which can be attributed to their different cell wall structures. Similar results were obtained for the sessile species. The results also revealed that performance was improved by using titanium-based implants, even at very low concentrations. Hussein et al. (2013) produced chitosan (a biopolymer), by extracting the exoskeletons of crustaceans found in seafood waste. It was 85.2% deacetylated and had an average molecular weight of 109 kDa. Chitosan was derivatized, forming 2-N,N-diethylbenzene ammonium chloride N-oxoethyl chitosan, called compound I, and 12-ammonium chloride N-oxododecan chitosan, ecofriendly inhibitors of carbon steel corrosion in low-pH media. The results demonstrated that compound I was the more efficient corrosion inhibitor. Comparing the antibacterial activity of chitosan and its derivatives indicated that chitosan (compound II) was more effective than its derivatives against several bacteria: C. albicans, E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus. Yuan et al. (2012) attempted to reduce biocorrosion by sulfate-reducing bacteria. This approach involved a combination of surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization and in situ chemical oxidative graft polymerization techniques. Stainless steel was tethered with a poly(4-vinylaniline)-polyaniline (PVAn-PANI) bilayer layer coating. This method involved three steps: in the first step, a trichlorosilane coupling agent was immobilized on the stainless steel surface, providing sulfonyl halide groups for the ATRP of PVAn; in the second step, PANI was grafted onto the PVAn in situ; in the third step, the PVAn-PANI bilayer reduced bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on the stainless steel surface, as showed by electrochemical test results, confirming that their anticorrosion and antibacterial properties were suitable for severe environments. Hakkinen et al. (2004) has reported electrochemical microbial antifouling technology for the prevention of biofilm and inorganic deposits on stainless steel surfaces. This is based on polarization of the steel surface. A preventive current is passed from an electrode to the (metal) surface to be protected through an electrolyte, leading to oxidation and reduction reactions. These reactions temporarily change the pH of the metal surface. This creates conditions that prevent microbial attachment. Several UPM mills are running full-scale microbial antifouling technology systems successfully.",

When biofilms on photocatalytic TiO 2 surfaces, submerged in water, were exposed to 20 W h m\u22122 of 360 nm light, both kinds of adhesion threads were completely destroyed and the D. geothermalis cells were extensively removed (from >107 down to below 106 cells cm \u22122 ). TiO 2 films prepared by the sol-gel technique were slightly more effective than those prepared by the ALD technique. Doping of the TiO 2 with sulfur did not enhance its biofilm-destroying capacity. The results show that photocatalytic TiO 2 surfaces have potential as a self-cleaning technology for warm water using industries.",

When D. geothermalis biofilms grown for 24 h in simulated paper machine water were exposed to cathodic or cathodically weighted pulsed polarization at least 60% (P < 0.05) of the biofilms were removed from stainless steel (AISI 316L). Biofilm removal by 25 ppm (effective substances 5-25 ppm) of oxidizing biocides (bromochloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, 2,2-dibromo-2-cyanoacetamide, peracetic acid) increased to 70% when combined with cathodically weighted pulsed polarization. Using a novel instrument that allows real-time detection of reactive oxygen species, these researchers showed that the polarization program is effective in antifouling generated reactive oxygen species in a pulsed manner on the steel surface. They suggested that the observed added value of oxidative biocides combined with polarization depended on reactive oxygen species. This suggestion was supported by the finding that a reductive biocide, methylene bisthiocyanate, counteracted the antifouling effect of polarization (Table 8 .39). ",
