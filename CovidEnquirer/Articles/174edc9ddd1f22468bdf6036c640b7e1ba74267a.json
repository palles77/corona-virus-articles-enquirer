            "text": "COPD is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. 1,2 Among several risk factors, cigarette smoking is the most important one. However, smoking alone does not explain all the aspects of COPD. COPD can develop even in nonsmokers, especially in the context of biomass exposure in some parts of the world. More than half of smokers do not develop COPD. A subset of patients with COPD exhibits persistent inflammation despite smoking cessation. 3, 4 In addition, accelerated loss of lung function may occur independent of smoking and occur with acute COPD exacerbations. 5 It is important to elucidate additional contributive factors besides smoking to control the disease. COPD is characterized by chronic inflammation of the small airways. Respiratory tract infection is an important cause of acute exacerbation and progression of the disease. 6 Common Viral Infections and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbations Historically, bacteria have been considered the main infectious cause of COPD exacerbations. 7 A growing body of evidence, however, implicates viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) as the predominant risk factor associated with exacerbations of COPD. 8 Approximately 40% to 60% of all COPD exacerbations are associated with upper respiratory infections (URIs) and viral infections have been suggested to be important contributors to COPD exacerbations. 9 In fact, it has been shown that respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause COPD exacerbations. [10] [11] [12] These exacerbations are more severe, last longer, and are associated with more heightened airway and systemic inflammatory responses than exacerbations due to other nonviral causes. [13] [14] [15] These differences cannot be attributed solely to pulmonary structural alterations in patients with COPD because healthy smokers also experience exaggerated symptomatic responses after viral infections. [16] [17] [18] Detection rates of virus in COPD exacerbation are variable between approximately 22% and 64%. 9, 11, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] The detection rates depend on onset to presentation, type of samples, and season. The most commonly identified viruses in exacerbation of COPD include rhinovirus, influenza viruses, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and coronavirus. Among them, rhinovirus and metapneumovirus are the most common viral pathogens in studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 12, 13, 25 In these studies, rhinovirus was detected in 8% to 44% in the events of COPD acute exacerbation. Influenza vaccination rate can also affect the prevalence. A Hong Kong study showed that influenza was the most common virus in hospitalized patients with COPD; meanwhile, a cohort from a London outpatient clinic showed low prevalence due to relatively high influenza vaccination rate (74%). 11, 15 Many COPD exacerbations also include virus and bacteria coinfection. Approximately 25% of the hospitalized patients with COPD exacerbations showed coinfection. The clinical impact of coinfection is longer hospital stay and severe functional impairment. 28 Symptoms of COPD exacerbation include cough, increased sputum volume and purulence, and dyspnea; however, it is not easy to differentiate viral and nonviral causes of COPD exacerbation by symptoms. Typical \"common-cold\" symptoms, including fever, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea, are prevalent in patients with COPD when virus is detected, but those symptoms also can be noted in nonviral exacerbation, so their usefulness in diagnosis remains limited. 13, 29 Sputum purulence has been suggested as evidence for bacterial infection in COPD exacerbation, but sputum also can be purulent due to neutrophilia irrespective of causal organism. 30 Furthermore, almost all COPD exacerbations can be marked with change in sputum characteristics. 31 Therefore, the sputum characteristics are not a useful marker to differentiate viral and bacterial infection. On the other hand, sputum purulence may be used to decide the usage of antibiotics. 32 Although neutrophils are the predominantly increased cell type in sputum during COPD exacerbations, one report showed increased eosinophilia during viral exacerbations. 28 Viral exacerbations also are associated with frequent exacerbations, severe exacerbations, and a prolonged time for symptom recovery. 13 Viruses also can be detected in stable COPD. Patients with RSV infection had higher plasma fibrinogen, serum interleukin (IL)-6, and hypercapnia in stable state. 13 This suggests that asymptomatic viral colonization can potentially have a role in chronic inflammation and disease progression of COPD. Another study that supports this showed a relationship between frequent RSV detection and accelerated lung function decline (101.4 mL/y vs 51.2 mL/y, P 5 .01). 33 It has been proposed that the alveolar epithelial cells of smokers and patients with severe emphysema are more frequently latently infected with adenovirus as compared with smokers without airflow obstruction. 34, 35 They found COPD lung epithelial cells express adenoviral E1A protein, and that this was associated with specific lung inflammation. The investigators propose such adenoviral infections in patients with COPD contribute to the amplification of the lung inflammatory responses.",

The introduction of PCR helped revolutionize viral diagnostics; PCR is far more sensitive and equally specific to the traditional techniques that include culture, antigen-detection tests, and serology. 36, 37 Rhinovirus is one of the most common viruses in COPD exacerbation, but it is difficult to culture and serology is not possible due to the presence of more than 100 serotypes. Without PCR, these viruses cannot be identified. As a result, early studies using other diagnostic methods underestimated the prevalence of rhinovirus. 15 Among various methods to obtain samples, such as nasal lavage, throat swab, or induced sputum, it is not yet evident which method is superior. Some viruses, especially RSV, can directly invade the lower respiratory tract; therefore, obtaining a simultaneous lower respiratory tract sample can increase the sensitivity of these assays. The big challenge of this molecular diagnostic approach is that it cannot discriminate causative organisms from colonization. Antiviral therapy is not necessary in most immunocompetent and asymptomatic patients with COPD. Antiviral therapy is not indicated solely on the basis of a known diagnosis of COPD. Most endemic viral infections are self-limiting, and pharmacologic management is not necessary. In the case of severe and progressive pandemic influenza virus, oseltamivir is indicated when the clinical diagnosis is made. 38 One of the difficult decisions is not to prescribe antibiotics when they are not necessary. When the causative organism is a virus, antibiotics are not usually necessary unless one is concerned about postviral secondary bacterial lung infections. Although sputum characteristics do not indicate the causative organisms, sputum purulence can be suggested to decide the usage of antibiotics. 32 Influenza vaccination is highly recommended in patients with COPD and other chronic lung diseases.",

A variety of studies dating to 1981 reported variable incidences of common respiratory pathogens, including influenza A and B (12%-77%), RSV (9%-58%), parainfluenza virus (PIV), rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and adenovirus. [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] In these studies, the incidence of specific viral isolates varied greatly from one study to the next due to multiple factors, including methodology, seasonal variation, geographic location, and different age groups. In a recent study of 100 adults with CF, followed prospectively for 12 months, rhinovirus accounted for 72.5% of confirmed viral infections, followed by metapneumovirus (13.2%), and adenovirus (4.1%). Unlike previous studies, influenza virus A and B, PIV, and RSV together accounted for only 10.6% of viral isolates. 65, 66 Previous studies have shown that individuals with CF are no more susceptible to viral infections than healthy controls. In a prospective study of school-aged individuals with CF compared with age-matched controls, there was no difference in the frequency of culture-documented and seropositive viral infections. Younger patients had a higher incidence of viral infections in both groups; however, this did not translate into accelerated lung function decline in the patients with CF. 59 A later study evaluating the impact of viral infections on pulmonary function in infants with CF similarly showed no difference in the incidence of viral infections. However, infants with CF had an increased frequency of respiratory symptoms. Whereas controls did not demonstrate an association between respiratory illness and lung function, infants with CF who suffered an RSV infection and developed respiratory symptoms had a reduction in lung function. 67 A prospective study examining the impact of RSV infection on lung function in a pediatric population demonstrated again that subjects with CF had an increased frequency of respiratory symptoms despite similar rates of viral isolation from cultures and serology in healthy controls. The investigators demonstrated clear associations between RSV infection and worsening clinical severity score, lung function measurements, and rates and duration of hospitalizations for respiratory exacerbations. 68 ",

            "text": "CF respiratory exacerbations are acute clinical deteriorations in a patient's clinical condition characterized by increased respiratory symptoms and sputum production, and declines in lung function. Exacerbations are commonly precipitated by acquisition of new organisms or changes in respiratory flora. [69] [70] [71] CF pulmonary exacerbation rates are increased during winter and have been linked to the influenza season. 72, 73 The viruses most frequently implicated in causing respiratory symptoms in CF include rhinovirus, RSV, adenovirus, PIV, influenza A and B, and metapneumovirus. [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] 66, 67 Viral infections are frequently detected during CF exacerbations and viral detection has improved with significant leaps in diagnostic technologies. The implementation of quantitative real-time PCR studies for viral detection in the CF population achieved the highest detection rate of 46% compared with existing literature that previously relied on serologic testing or viral isolation. 61 Identification of a respiratory virus during exacerbation purports clinical deterioration and increased duration of IV antibiotic compared with virus-negative exacerbations. 60 In a study of 103 children with CF respiratory exacerbations, 61.3% had a positive viral isolation. 74 Two studies in adult patients with CF reported viral isolation rates during exacerbation of 30.5% (n 5 100) and 50% (n 5 30). 66, 75 Although virus-positive exacerbations were associated with higher respiratory symptom scores and serum biomarkers of inflammation, viral infection did not increase rates of lung function decline compared with virusnegative exacerbation. Similarly, there was no significant association between viral infection and accelerated lung function decline in long-term follow-up. 66 A recent study combining pediatric and adult populations reported even higher incidence of virus-positive exacerbations, with 68% in adults and 72% in children. 76 RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in young children. 77 In children with CF, RSV and influenza have been shown to have the most significant effect in lung function. In infants with CF, RSV infection accounted for up to one-third of hospitalizations, respiratory failure, and chronic supplemental oxygen requirement when followed for more than 2 years. 78 In addition to RSV, influenza A and B infection has been detected in 12% to 23% of CF exacerbations. 61, 79, 80 Influenza also has been associated with acute and sustained declines in lung function, as well as respiratory failure, and subsequent supplemental oxygen requirement. In a study of 54 pediatric patients, those with an influenza virus-positive exacerbation had larger declines in lung function (26% vs 6% with other viruses). In addition, influenza infection was more frequently associated with larger drops in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) than the other viral infections. 81 According to data from the European Cystic Fibrosis Society, the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 had a severe impact on adult and pediatric patients with CF. The prevalence of infection among 25 centers in multiple countries ranged from 0% to 9.4%. Among the 110 cases reported, the incidence of exacerbations was 53%; 48% of these patients required hospitalization, and 31% required supplemental oxygen. There were 6 incidences of respiratory failure and 3 fatalities. Patients with advanced lung disease were more likely to suffer a severe clinical course. Interestingly, most of the patients recovered lung function to preinfection values. 82, 83 Rhinovirus is increasingly reported as a significant pathogen in the CF population. Rhinovirus has now been associated with increased respiratory symptoms, lung function decline, and frequency of exacerbations. 66, 74, 76 This may be due to improvements in detection techniques and inclusion of a more recently detected species, rhinovirus C. 74 ",

Several risk and predisposing factors of pulmonary fibrosis include environmental, tobacco smoking, viral infections, family history, and genetics. Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by progressive lung decline over time, with many patients experiencing disease stability punctuated by episodes of acute worsening of clinical symptoms and radiographic changes on chest imaging.",

However, it is unclear if these exacerbations truly accelerate the underlying fibrotic and proliferative process in pulmonary fibrosis or if it is due to complications such as infections, given IPF exacerbations are often accompanied by cough and fever. Initially it has been suspected that respiratory viruses are likely causes of IPF exacerbations. Compared with the strong association between viruses and exacerbations of obstructive lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, there is currently very little research to suggest possible cause for exacerbations in IPF.",

Although the antimicrobial peptide, alpha defensing, was found to be increased in the epithelium and the peripheral blood, 91 using multiplex PCR and pan-viral microarray discovery platform and next-generation deep sequencing to increase viral detection sensitivity, viral infection was not detected in most cases of acute IPF exacerbations. Four of 43 patients with IPF acute exacerbations had evidence of common respiratory viral infections (2 rhinovirus, 1 coronavirus, 1 parainfluenza), whereas no viruses were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from stable patients. 92 Interestingly, torque teno virus (TTV), a relatively new single-stranded DNA virus, was found to be more common in patients with acute exacerbations than in stable controls. However, TTV also can be detected in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, suggesting that this virus is not specific to IPF. Deep sequencing of the lungs from patients with acute exacerbation of IPF did not reveal any evidence for viral pathogens.",

It is still possible viral associations have not been clearly proven due to the timing of sampling of IPF patients during their exacerbations or possible incorrect compartment sampling to identify viruses (bronchoalveolar fluid vs interstitial disease). Gene expression studies of lung tissues show suggestive of type II alveolar epithelial cell injury or proliferation, endothelial cell injury, and coagulation in patients with acute exacerbation of IPF that is distinct from patients with acute lung injury. 93 It is possible there are no major associations with conventional respiratory viruses with IPF. However, there have been reports of the presence of certain human herpesviruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), in patients with IPF and animal models of fibrosis. 94 Another study showed patients with IPF who underwent lung transplantation were found to be positive for EBV (11/12) and human herpesvirus (HHV)-6B (10/12) compared with control lung samples that were positive for HHV-6B (3/10) and negative for EBV (0/10). 95 They suggest that herpesviruses could contribute to the lung epithelial injury that initiates profibrotic responses in IPF. Whether or not IPF acute exacerbation represents reactivation of latent herpesviruses remains unknown and requires further explorations.",

Epidemiologic studies and basic research suggest that sarcoidosis represents an immune response to an exogenous agent in a genetically susceptible individual. A definitive exogenous agent responsible for sarcoidosis remains elusive. Some investigators have speculated that a transmissible or infectious agent may cause sarcoidosis. 97 There has been an increasing body of evidence to suggest a link between infection and sarcoidosis, especially with regard to Mycobacteria and Propionibacteria. The thought is that maybe persistent antigenic stimulation from microbial agents at sites of inflammation results in sarcoidosis. However, to date, identifying the etiology of sarcoidosis has remained elusive. A variety of viruses have been proposed as etiologic agents or triggers for sarcoidosis; yet, this association has been difficult to define. The viruses associated with sarcoidosis based on serology include EBV, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, HHV-6 and HHV-8, and coxsackie virus. 96, 98 Data supporting an increased frequency of these viral respiratory infections in sarcoidosis have been lacking.",

There is much less compelling evidence for the association of viruses with IPF or sarcoidosis.
