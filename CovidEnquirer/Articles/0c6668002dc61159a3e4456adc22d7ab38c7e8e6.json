Animal experiments involving risk grade 3 agents such as SARS CoV, HIV, M.tb, H7N9, and Brucella must be conducted in an Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL-3) facility. Because of the in vivo work, the biosafety risk in ABSL-3 facilities is higher than that in BSL-3 facilities. Undoubtedly, management practices must be strengthened to ensure biosafety in the ABSL-3 facility. Meanwhile, we cannot ignore the reliable scientific results obtained from animal experiments conducted in ABSL-3 laboratories. It is of great practical significance to study the overall biosafety concepts that can increase the scientific data quality. Based on the management of animal experiments in the ABSL-3 Laboratory of Wuhan University, combined with relevant international and domestic literature, we indicate the main safety issues and factors affecting animal experiment results at ABSL-3 facilities. Based on these issues, management practices regarding animal experiments in ABSL-3 facilities are proposed, which take into account both biosafety and scientifically sound data.",

Risk group 3 pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndromes coronavirus (SARS CoV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), H7N9 influenza virus, and Brucella cause serious or lethal human disease and present a significant public health hazard. Animal experiments involving these highly infectious agents are required to be conducted in an ABSL-3 facility. [1] [2] [3] [4] As biosafety facilities for in vivo work, ABSL-3 facilities require more complex biosafety management practices than BSL-3 facilities. 5 There is no doubt that ensuring biosafety is the highest priority of animal experiment management at ABSL-3 facilities. At the same time, we cannot ignore the scientifically valuable results of animal experiments obtained in ABSL-3 laboratories. Therefore, a study of the animal experiment management practice points that takes into account data quality from a biosafety premise is of great significance. What kinds of safety management concepts should ABSL-3 laboratories take into consideration for animal experi-ments? What are the main safety issues and factors affecting the quality of scientifically sound data? What are the main points of management practice? We provide a preliminary discussion of the above issues based on the management experience at Wuhan University ABSL-3 Laboratory and relevant international and domestic literature.",

The other is ''quality of scientifically sound data\", which guarantees the integrity and reliability of scientific research data and ensures achieving scientific research objectives based on safety. The two elements of ''biosafety\" and ''quality of scientifically sound data\" should both be considered. Therefore, we need to establish an overall biosafety concept that ensures the safety of the animal experiments first, and then the animal care and research procedures should be optimized in order to obtain reliable scientifically sound data from the animal experiments.

When their physical and psychological well-being is maintained, the animals minimize their stress response to the environment and manipulations. Therefore, they have more stable physiological and biochemical indicators and the results of animal experiments are more reliable.",

However, unlike the common commercial animal biocontainment IVC (individually ventilated isolation cage) for mice, NHP animal cages sometimes need to be customized according to the experimental demands. 7 The customized NHP cages should be designed to meet the requirements of animal welfare and the convenience of operation while considering the biosafety. The animal biocontainment cages that make it difficult to care for and handle animals are not applicable. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a primary barrier used to protect workers. The PPE worn within the ABSL-3 facility may limit the worker's vision and reduce tactile sensation. These limits reduce the worker's accuracy. As a result, when the workers use needles and other sharp instruments for procedures, they have an increased chance of injury. 8 Therefore, the Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) and training programs should be optimized to improve the accuracy and stability of the operations according to the specific PPE requirements, and those efforts can ensure both ''biosafety\" and ''scientifically sound data quality\".",

Proper surgical methods and skilled techniques are also important for obtaining credible experimental data.
