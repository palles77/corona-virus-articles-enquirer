Ribavirin is highly soluble, but its permeability characteristics are not well defined. Therefore according to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System, and taking a \"worst case\" approach, ribavirin should be assigned to class III. As ribavirin is transported across the brush border membrane of the human jejunum by hCNT2, it shows saturable uptake in the intestine. However, no common excipients have been shown to compete for ribavirin absorption, nor have problems with BE of immediate release ribavirin formulations containing different excipients and produced by different manufacturing methods been reported in the open literature. So the risk of bioinequivalence caused by these factors appears to be low. Ribavirin is considered a narrow therapeutic index drug, as judged by comparing the minimum effective concentration and minimum toxic concentrations in blood. Although ribavirin would not be eligible for approval via a Biopharmaceutical Classification Systemebased biowaiver procedure according to today's guidances due to its narrow therapeutic index, the risks of biowaiving should be weighed against the considerable risks associated with studying BE of ribavirin products in healthy subjects.",

For this purpose, risk is defined as the combination of the probability of an incorrect biowaiver decision with the consequences of the decision in terms of public health and individual patient risk. Based on these considerations, the monograph assesses the validity of the biowaiver and recommends its acceptance or rejection. This systematic approach to recommending or advising against a biowaiver decision is referred to in the WHO guideline. 3 It is notable that these monographs do not simply apply the various guidances on biowaiver-based BE (e.g., WHO, 3 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] , 4 ",

It is given orally with an interferon alpha or peg interferon alpha in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and it is used by inhalation for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infections. 9, 11 The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines recommend ribavirin plus peg interferon as the treatment of choice for chronic hepatitis C virus infections. Evaluation of clinical outcomes and patient tolerability determine the benefit and length of the therapy. Ribavirin plus peg interferon alfa is also approved by the FDA for treatment of hepatitis C in HIVinfected patients. 12 According to the Essential Medicines List of the WHO, ribavirin can be used for the treatment of hepatitis C in combination with peg-interferon and/or direct acting anti-viral medicines, as well as for the treatment of viral hemorrhagic fevers 2 such as hemorrhagic fever associated with renal syndrome, Lassa fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Ribavirin has also been tried in severe acute respiratory syndrome. 9, 11 Maynard et al. reported that 67% of genotype-1 infected patients achieved a sustained virological response (SVR) at week 4 when ribavirin plasma concentrations were higher than 2.0 mg/mL, while only 16% of patients achieved SVR at week 4 when ribavirin concentrations were lower. 13 Furthermore, Arase et al. 14 evaluated the effect of ribavirin concentration at week 8 in 68 genotype-1 infected patients. The SVR was 14.8% for patients with a steady-state serum ribavirin concentration of <2.5 mg/mL. For patients with a steady-state serum ribavirin concentration between 2.5 and 3 mg/mL, SVR was 25%. At ribavirin concentrations between 3 and 3.5 mg/mL, the SVR was 44.4% and at concentrations >3.5 mg/mL the SVR was reported as 42.9%. Because the frequency of discontinuation of therapy at serum concentrations >3.5 mg/mL was significantly higher, the most suitable ribavirin concentration in serum at week 8 was concluded to be in the range 3-3.5 mg/mL.",

It represents a dose-dependent side effect that frequently limits ribavirin use.

This level was also confirmed by Arase et al. 14 Severe ribavirin-induced anemia can increase fatigue and worsen quality of life, and hence it is a frequent cause of reduction of the ribavirin dose or even discontinuation. 17 This presents the physician with a dilemma, as the efficacy of ribavirin improves with increasing plasma concentrations, but the severity of anemia also becomes higher with increasing concentrations.",

A comprehensive list of reported adverse effects is available in the literature. 9, 12 Because ribavirin and its metabolites are cleared by the kidneys, the drug should be used with extreme caution in patients with renal disease or renal failure. It should also be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver (Child-Pugh class B and C). 9, 12, 18 Acute ingestion of up to 20 g of Rebetol capsules was associated with an increased incidence and severity of the usual adverse effects of the drug. 19, 20 Ribavirin accumulates in human erythrocytes and remains in the body for weeks or longer after administration of the drug and hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is not effective for the treatment of ribavirin overdosage. 19, 20 Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia have also been observed in persons administered greater than the recommended dose of ribavirin.

[33] [34] [35] In these studies, about 85% of the orally administered drug was found to be absorbed, although the mean absolute BA for a 400-mg dose of ribavirin was found to be only about 52%. 33, 35 Its low oral BA was thought to be caused at least in part by first-pass metabolism. 33 As the pharmacokinetic parameters of ribavirin are positively influenced by food, the manufacturers of ribavirin capsules (Rebetol \u00ae ) and tablets (Copegus \u00ae ), the 2 reference listed drug products which are available on several markets, recommend that the drug products be taken with food, given that administration in the fed state increases C max , AUC, and T max up to 70%. 20, 25, 26 Permeability Information about the permeability of ribavirin in the literature is limited. Caco-2 cell apparent permeability of ribavirin is reported as about 0.18 \u00c2 10 \u00c06 cm/s. There was no mention of a high permeability control drug being used in this study. 34 The low permeability of ribavirin through Caco-2 cell monolayers is probably due to the lack of high hCNT2 expression in that transport system.",

The half-life of the distribution phase is~3.7 h. The terminal elimination phase is long, with a mean final concentration time point following single dosing at~100 h and an elimination half-life of 79 h. The C max and AUC both obey a linear relationship with dosage over the usual dose range of 200-1200 mg, 37, 38 although at higher doses (between 1200 and 2400 mg) the C max shows a non-linear increase. 31, 32 Following multiple dosing, ribavirin gradually accumulates in plasma, reaching a maximum concentration, C ss,max , in~4 weeks.

The C max and the AUC 0-t met the standard criteria for bioequivalence. 26 In another evaluation, the BE of a generic ribavirin 200-mg hard capsule (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd) to the reference product was demonstrated in randomized parallel arms. In this study, 87 male individuals received a single 200-mg dose under fed state conditions. The 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the geometric means of C max (90.3%-108.0%) and AUC 0-t (95.4%-113%) were within the limits of 80%-125%. 24 In 2 further BE studies conducted under fasting (43 volunteers, of which 38 completed) or fed (43 volunteers, of which 36 completed) conditions as open-label, two-way crossover studies with at least a 5week washout period by Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals, LLC, healthy volunteers received a single 3 \u00c2 200-mg dose as capsule versus its originator counterpart. Results showed that the point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for both the first study AUC 0-t (95.3%-106.5%) and C max (93.6%-108.8%) and the second study AUC 0-t (98.03%-105.43%) and C max (100.71%-109.42%) all fell within the usual bioequivalence acceptance range of 80%-125%.",

A comparison of the concentration needed for acceptable therapy and the minimum concentration at which hemolytic anemia is observed, as reported in the open literature, leads to the conclusion that there is a narrow therapeutic window for ribavirin.",

Furthermore, it seems that high initial doses (or, in this case, a single dose) 15 are more likely to result in adverse effects.",

In addition to class 1 APIs, the WHO guideline 3 and the EMA 5 guideline have extended the possibility of a biowaiver approval to BCS class III APIs under certain conditions. However, ribavirin, as discussed above, can be considered an NTI drug because there is less than a 2-fold difference in the minimum toxic concentrations and minimum effective concentrations in the blood. Hemolytic anemia is a frequent and severe side effect of ribavirin, which can limit therapy with this substance. The severity of anemia is increased with increasing ribavirin plasma concentrations. This gives rise to patient risk with either sub-bioequivalent or supra-bioequivalent products. 17 Therefore, even though ribavirin is a BCS class III drug and there have been no reports of product bioinequivalence in the literature, a biowaiver for IR ribavirin solid oral dosage form would not be considered acceptable according to current bioequivalence guidances because of its narrow therapeutic index. Although bioequivalence of new solid oral dosage forms containing ribavirin should in principle be approved on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies, regulatory authorities may wish to determine which is the best option for assessing bioequivalence of ribavirin products in the context of their local needs.",
