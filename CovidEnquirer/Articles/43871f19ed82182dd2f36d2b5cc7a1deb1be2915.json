Management of aerosols generated by an oscillating saw is a significant challenge. A plastic bag may be applied to enclose the head during use of the saw. The head of the oscillating saw may be modified to accept a vacuum attachment. The autopsy table may be equipped with downdraft ventilation. Gloves or other surfaces of PPE should be considered ''dirty'' even if not visibly contaminated. A PPE item in use should never touch areas of an autopsy suite that are considered ''clean.'' These ''clean'' areas include a dry work surface used for writing notes, a telephone, and a door handle.",

This is far from the case in many instances. Bodies requiring identification by odontological means are by their very nature often unrecognizable in a conventional way. This may be due to the effects of trauma, incineration, or putrefaction singly or in combination.In extreme circumstances where a body or bodies have been badly burned, the first problem may be even to locate the head and the oral structures that remain. Large-format radiography, preferably realtime fluoroscopy, often has to be used to locate structures of interest (Figure 1 ). This problem obviously does not confront the dentist treating living patients.Generally, oral structures that are useful in the corroboration of identity are preferentially preserved",
