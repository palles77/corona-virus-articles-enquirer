            "text": "Host cell cyclophilins have emerged as key determinants in the pathogenesis of numerous viruses. They are highly expressed proteins, accounting for approximately 0.5% of the total cytosolic proteins, and are secreted as well, possessing chemokine-like properties. 1, 2 Most cyclophilins are enzymes that catalyze the reversible interconversion of prolylpeptide bonds (i.e. peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, PPIases) and this activity aids in protein folding 3 and regulates protein functions during signal transduction. 4 Although the catalytic role of cyclophilins in viral infection remains unknown, it is clear that both RNA and DNA viruses depend on these host enzymes. Viruses that utilize host cell cyclophilins include vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), 5 severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), 6 simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), 7 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 8 hepatitis C, 9 and vaccinia virus (VV). 10 Disruption of viral/host-cyclophilin interactions either abolishes or severely impairs cellular infection, consistent with studies that suggest cyclophilins play multiple roles in viral pathogenesis. Such roles include stabilizing proteins involved in viral replication 5, 9 and protecting proteins from cellular restriction factors. 11 Additionally, several viruses package host cell cyclophilins into mature virions and in some cases they are relocated to viral membranes where they may aid in cellular adhesion. 12 It is not yet clear whether the roles of cyclophilins are virus-specific or if there are common themes to viral utilization of these host enzymes.",

However, the Mimivirus is missing 5 of the 31 conserved genes that define NCLDVs and 80% of the Mimivirus' ORFs have never been observed, suggesting an evolutionarily distinct lineage. 21 One of the most surprising features of the Mimivirus is that it contains several eukaryotic homologues, including several tRNAsynthetases as well as mimicyp.",

            "text": "To begin addressing the role of this first identified virally encoded cyclophilin during the lifecycle of the Mimivirus and possibly gain insight into the roles of cyclophilins in viral infection in general, we have characterized mimicyp biochemically, structurally, and in vivo. Our most striking finding is that mimicyp is located on the surface of mature Mimivirus virions as revealed by immunofluorescence studies, supporting reports that host cell hCypA is recruited by both HIV-1 22, 23 and SARS 6 to viral membranes. Although our 2.0 \u00c5 resolution X-ray crystal structure reveals that mimicyp retains all cyclophilin secondary structural elements, there are fundamental differences that make this protein unique from other cyclophilins as probed by NMR solution studies. First, mimicyp self-associates through at least two regions: one region is responsible for the formation of trimers and the other may induce trimer-trimer interactions. Second, unlike other cyclophilins, the putative active site of mimicyp is acidic despite the protein as a whole being highly basic. The active site accommodates a basic loop from a neighboring molecule within the asymmetric unit. Part of this loop adopts a conformation similar to other cyclophilin substrates, such as the HIV-1 capsid bound to hCypA. 24 In accord with this very divergent active site, mimicyp is unable to catalyze the isomerization of standard proline containing peptides. This indicates that mimicyp is not a PPIase that is also consistent with the absence of the catalytic arginine found in the majority of cyclophilins. Thus, unless another host cell cyclophilin is recruited during the viral life cycle, this study suggests that PPIase activity is not critical for Mimivirus infection. Moreover, localization of mimicyp to the virion surface suggests that this protein may play a structural role and/or an as yet unidentified role in the Mimivirus life cycle.",

A sequence analysis reveals that the closest phylogenetic homolog to mimicyp is that of Entamoeba histolytica cyclophilin (EhCyp) that shares 33% similarity and 25% identity and has been isolated. 25 However, it should be noted that the genome of A. polyphaga, the initial host of the Mimivirus, is not yet available and that a cyclophilin from this organism may also be highly similar to mimicyp. The mimicyp ORF encodes for a protein of 242 residues, somewhat larger than hCypA (165 residues), hCypB (208 residues), and EhCyp (167 residues). Of particular interest is the absence of the highly conserved arginine residue that has been implicated in catalysis by NMR, X-ray crystallography, and activity studies [26] [27] [28] (Figure 1(a) ). Asn83 in mimicyp has replaced this catalytic residue (Arg55 in hCypA, Arg63 in hCypB, and Arg57 in EhCyp), suggesting a complete lack of PPIase activity probed further below or a different enzyme mechanism relative to other cyclophilins. Furthermore, this may suggest that the enzymatic activity of this cyclophilin is not important for the life cycle of the Mimivirus and that there is an evolutionarily distinct function other than peptidyl-prolyl isomerization.",

This supports a very different substrate specificity for mimicyp and strongly suggests that this cyclophilin does not engage the inhibitor cyclosporine-A (CSA). CSA specifically targets the active site of many cyclophilin family members and its binding to mimicyp would disrupt oligomeric interactions further discussed below. However, CSA exhibits a wide array of affinities to cyclophilins and mimicyp contains only two of the 13 active site residues critical for binding this inhibitor. 30 In fact a change of just one of these residues, Trp121 in hCypA (Figure 1(a) ), has been found to reduce the affinity to CSA by nearly three orders of magnitude, as observed in many Gramnegative bacterial cyclophilins 31,32 as well as some human cyclophilins. 33 Thus, CSA is not expected to bind mimicyp and in accord with this our attempts to observe such an interaction failed. For example, NMR spectra of mimicyp concentrated in the presence of CSA were identical to that in the absence of the inhibitor, indicating no binding (data not shown). This is in contrast to the NMR spectra of CSA/hCypA that is markedly different than hCypA alone, as observed by both others and us. [34] [35] [36] Residues on the opposite side of the monomer from the putative active site, including residues within the C-terminal helix, mediate trimer-trimer contacts. (b) Close-up of the basic loop insertion into the acidic putative active site that forms each trimer. The basic loop is shown in green with heavy atoms of side-chains included and the active site is shown as a surface representation with basic residues shown in blue, acidic residues in red, and uncharged or hydrophobic residues in white. (c) Intermolecular electrostatic side-chain pairs that stabilize the trimer are formed between Lys188, Arg193, Lys194 from the basic loop and Asp164, Asp144 and Asp94 of the putative acidic active site, respectively. (d) Intermolecular electrostatic pairs that stabilize trimer-trimer formation include side-chain interactions of Asp178-Arg30 and Ser209-Lys34, and intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed between backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of Tyr174 and Leu207 with the side-chains of Gln32 and Gln172, respectively. (e) Overlay of mimicyp intermolecular interactions with the hCypA/HIV-1 capsid complex (PDB accession number 1AK4) exhibits both similarities and differences. The mimicyp residues 188-194 are shown that comprise a type II \u03b2-turn, Tyr190-Arg193, and the HIV-1 capsid residues 483-494 form a relatively extended structure. These loops bind to each cyclophilin in opposing directions, yet approximately half of the residues within each, i.e. comprising the HIV-1 capsid loop and the neighboring mimicyp inserted loop, are nearly superimposed. The same secondary structural elements of mimicyp and hCypA shown in Figure 1 were used to align the two complexes.",

The C \u03b1 -C \u03b1 distance within this loop between Tyr190 and Arg193 is 5.4 \u00c5, well under the 7 \u00c5 definition of a \u03b2-turn, while the \u03d5, \u03c8 angles of Ala191 (\u221256\u00b0,130\u00b0) and Gly192 (83\u00b0,\u221211\u00b0) define a type II \u03b2-turn. 37 Several intermolecular electrostatic interactions are formed between this basic loop and the acidic active site of the adjacent monomer that include those between side-chains of Lys188-Asp164, Arg193-Asp144 and Lys194-Asp94 ( Figure  2 (b) and (c)). The distances between these side-chain heteronuclei are as close as 3 \u00c5; therefore, these residues likely form ionic bonds. The acidic surface that forms the trimer also includes several intermolecular interactions with the \u03b1-helix preceding the basic loop such as Lys182 in the basic loop and Glu137 in the helix. Although self-association through the active sites of cyclophilins has rarely been observed, there are several members for which this has been documented. These include PPWD1-Cyp (PDB accession code 2A2N, unpublished data), human cyclophilin-H, 38 and a cyclophilin from the mold Aspergillus fumigatus. 39 Like the predominantly electrostatic interactions observed between subunits within the trimer, interactions between trimers are also dominated by electrostatic interactions. Such trimer-trimer interactions occur on the face of the protein opposite the putative active site (Figure 2 (a)). Although there are numerous hydrophobic residues within this region, few are within 4 \u00c5 of each other and thus, may only marginally stabilize trimer-trimer interactions. In contrast, many intermolecular electrostatic interactions come as close as 3 \u00c5 such as those from the side-chains of Asp178-Arg30 and Ser209-Lys34, and intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed between backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of Tyr174 and Leu207 with the side-chains of Gln32 and Gln172, respectively (Figure 2(d)).",

For example, overlaying the mimicyp trimer with the hCypA/HIV-1 capsid N-terminal complex 24 reveals that approximately half of the inserted loop of mimicyp residues 188-194 overlaps with the HIV-1 capsid loop of residues 483-494 ( Figure 2 (e)). This loop on the HIV-1 capsid has been implicated in intermolecular dimer contacts that are important for viral assembly 40 and is in accord with our findings that this loop on the mimicyp is also responsible for oligomeric interactions. Specifically, the backbone atoms of HIV-1 capsid residues 485-489 and mimicyp residues 191-195 are within 1.0-2.5 \u00c5 for each respective pair. Thus, insight as to the ligand specificity of mimicyp may be drawn from its intermolecular interactions within the trimer. Specifically, unlike all other observed cyclophilin active sites that allow for the binding of a wide array of prolinecontaining peptides and proteins, the active site of mimicyp suggests that it will not preferentially accommodate proline residues. This conclusion is drawn from the acidic nature of the putative mimicyp active site, whereas most other cyclophilin active sites are hydrophobic and somewhat basic in nature. Thus, for mimicyp, ligands with basic residues are obviously preferred as observed for the basic residues 188-194 that insert into the active site ( Figure  2 (b)). The difference in specificity is also due to Asn83, which has replaced the typical cyclophilin catalytic residue (Arg55 in hCypA). For example, cocrystal structures indicate that Arg55 in hCypA normally makes stabilizing contacts with the prolylpeptide bond of proline-containing substrates, such as those with the HIV-1 capsid. 24, 27, 41 In contrast, the side-chain of Asn83 in mimicyp at best forms weak intermolecular stabilizing contacts with the backbone of Gly192 within the inserted basic loop of residues 188-194 (Asn83 is \u223c4 \u00c5 from both the amide and carbonyl atoms of Gly192).",

In fact, gel-filtration has indicated that mimicyp migrated predominantly as a monomer (data not shown), although it is important to note that under such conditions the protein is far less concentrated than in the crystal (\u223c100-fold). Thus, NMR was used to probe the oligomeric interactions under high concentrations in solution. Few resonances were initially observed in a 1 H-15 N transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (TROSY-HSQC) spectrum at a concentration of 0.3 mM, suggesting the oligomeric interactions observed within the X-ray structure also occur in solution (data not shown). The fact that mimicyp migrates primarily as a monomer at low concentrations and the loss of NMR signals at 0.3 mM concentration, indicates that the binding affinity of mimicyp for itself is relatively weak (i.e. K d \u223c50-500 \u03bcM), consistent with the affinities of other cyclophilins for substrates. 42 This observation of only a subset of resonances also indicates that these sample concentrations are on the same order as the mimicyp self-association constant, in agreement with our estimation of a weak self-association affinity. Consistent with the electrostatic nature of the observed interactions within the crystal, the addition of 100 mM arginine appeared to weaken this self-association, resulting in the observation of additional resonances in the 1 H-15 N TROSY-HSQC spectrum (Figure 3(a) ). However, even in the presence of arginine, only a subset of the resonances was visible. Moreover, these resonances exhibit severe line-broadening, suggesting a dynamic equilibrium between monomer and higher-order oligomers was still present in solution and that arginine served to shift this equilibrium more towards the monomeric state.",

Two regions of mimicyp were altered to disrupt the intermolecular contacts observed in the X-ray crystal structure, and 1 H-15 N TROSY-HSQC spectra were used to qualitatively monitor the impact on the apparent oligomeric equilibrium. These regions were chosen to specifically weaken either those interactions responsible for trimer formation or those responsible for trimer-trimer interactions ( Figure 2 ). Residues corresponding to the basic insertion loop (residues 188-194) responsible for trimer formation were removed first, yet this resulted in a highly unstable protein (data not shown). Replacing this loop with a random sequence of both glycine and serine residues (SGSSG), aimed at increasing protein solubility, resulted in a mutant protein that was stable (called \u0394188-194, recalling that SGSSG have replaced these residues). The remarkable change observed in the 1 H-15 N TROSY-HSQC spectrum of \u0394188-194 relative to the wild-type mimicyp suggests that disruption of the trimer interface does indeed shift the equilibrium towards a smaller observable species in solution (Figure 3(b) ). Similarly, truncating the C-terminal 29 residues of mimicyp (\u0394206-234) also resulted in a mutant protein that in solution has its equilibrium shifted towards a smaller oligomeric state (Figure 3(c) ). However, both spectra derived from these mutant forms remain line-broadened, presumably due to the presence of the other oligomeric interaction. Unfortunately the combined mutant resulted in an insoluble protein (i.e. replacing residues 188-194 with the sequence SGSSG and removing the C-terminal 29 residues). It should be noted that the C-terminal residues are highly basic (residues 206-234 have a pI\u223c11) and could potentially insert into the putative acidic active site in solution, as do residues 188-194. Thus, there may be a third means of self-association in solution that may be removed in the mutant \u0394206-234.",

Such substrates have served as standards for assessing the activity of cyclophilins, typically using chymotrypsin-coupled UV kinetic assays that measure the first order rate constant of cis-trans interconversion. 43, 44 Using NMR, we can directly monitor the reversible PPIase interconversion of substrates between cis and trans conformations. 45 In the absence of catalysis, such peptides give rise to two sets of resonances, one corresponding to each conformer. These conformations slowly interconvert between one another on the NMR timescale, giving rise to two distinct sets of resonances (Figure 4(a) ). However, an active PPIase, such as hCypA (3:1 ratio of substrate to enzyme), efficiently catalyses the cis/trans isomerization to bring the exchange into the fast exchange limit on the NMR timescale. 34 Consequently, a single set of averaged resonances is observed (Figure 4(b) ). In contrast to hCypA, in the presence of equal concentrations of mimicyp, two separate sets of resonances remain for Suc-AFPF-pNA and neither exhibit any apparent line-broadening (Figure 4(c) ). This indicates that the standard PPIase substrate does not bind and consequently does not undergo rapid interconversion in the presence of this viral cyclophilin. Such a lack of PPIase activity is most likely not due to mimicyp oligomeric interactions blocking access to the putative active site, since its In the presence of the active PPIase hCypA there is rapid interconversion between these two conformers by the enzyme 26 that leads to a single averaged resonance. Mimicyp neither catalyzes nor binds this peptide, as evidenced by the lack of chemical shifts changes. self-association constant estimated above as 50-500 \u03bcM is similar to the affinity that cyclophilins exhibit to their respective substrates. 42 Thus, mimicyp is not a PPIase, a result that is consistent with both the absence of the catalytic arginine (i.e. Asn83) and our structural data that have revealed an acidic putative active site.",

To this end, we have gone beyond confirming mimicyp expression and found that it is highly localized on the mature virion surface. As shown in Figure 5 (a), using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the polyclonal antibodies directed against recombinant mimicyp specifically recognizes a protein within Mimivirus extract. Both Western blots and silver staining lend further evidence that the antigen recognized in Mimivirus extracts is recombinant mimicyp, since both proteins migrate with the same molecular weight ( Figure  5(b) ). The other proteins recognized by the antibodies represent a very small fraction of the total proteins, since they are not visible upon silver staining SDS-PAGE gels ( Figure 5(c) ) and may be proteolyzed and larger mimicyp aggregates (possibly cross-linked through disulfide bridges over time). The recognized protein is specific for Mimivirus and is not related to a putative eukaryotic contamination. As illustrated by the immunofluorescence assay ( Figure 5(d)) , the mimicyp appears to envelop the mature virions, suggesting that it is located on the surface of the mature viral particles.",

Although our structural analysis reveals that the secondary structure of mimicyp is conserved within the cyclophilin family of enzymes, there are several significant differences. First, the explicit oligomeric interactions identified within the mimicyp that give rise to trimers in the crystals have not previously been observed in other cyclophilins. Second, the active site of the mimicyp is considerably more acidic than other cyclophilins, including those from both eukaryotes and protozoa. 50, 51 Third, we have shown by solution NMR that the mimicyp does not catalyze the isomerization of prolyl-peptide bonds and thus is not a PPIase, consistent with the absence of the catalytic arginine (Arg55 in hCypA is replaced with Asn83 in mimicyp). This is especially intri- guing considering peptidyl-prolyl isomerization mediated by host cyclophilins has been suggested to play a role in viral infection, 52 and the HIV-1 capsid is isomerized by hCypA. 53 In contrast, these data suggest that PPIase activity of mimicyp is not utilized during viral infection by the Mimivirus, although we cannot rule out an evolutionarily distinct catalytic function of mimicyp relative to the role that host cell cyclophilins play in other viral infections.",

The addition of arginine to the NMR sample weakened the self-association of mimicyp to allow us to begin probing both interactions mediated by the basic loop and the C-terminal end (Figure 3(a) ). Disrupting either of these interactions based on the crystal structure (mutants \u0394188-194 or \u0394206-234) shifted the dynamic equilibrium towards the monomeric species (Figure 3(b) and (c) ).

Initial NMR studies of PPWD1-Cyp indicate this association occurs in solution and is abrogated by removal of the N-terminal region (T. Davis, Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, personal communication). A more drastic self-association has been identified for cyclophilin from the mold A. fumigatus, where domain swapping of two \u03b2-strands and the small \u03b1-helix has been identified by X-ray crystallography 39 (Figure 7(d)) . A concentration-dependent monomer/swappeddimer equilibrium was found to exist in solution, with higher concentrations favoring swapped-dimer formation. We have also shown that mimicyp exists in an equilibrium between its monomer and higher order oligomers and that this equilibrium can be shifted towards the monomeric state by either high ionic strength or mutagenesis (Figure 3) . Thus, mimicyp self-association may also serve as a regulatory means of blocking (or exposing) a ligand-binding site (or substrate-binding site) in a concentration dependent manner.",

For example, the human N-terminal region of natural killer triggering receptor (NK-TR) contains a cyclophilin domain with a very weak affinity for CSA (i.e. millimolar) and many parasitic cyclophilins bind CSA with such weak affinity as well. 32 Moreover, there are many uncharacterized cyclophilins that may exhibit no affinity to CSA. For example, several parasitic cyclophilins have only a few of the 13 residues known to be critical for engaging CSA 32 and a human cyclophilin recently identified, peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin-like 4 (PPIL4), has only six of these 13 residues conserved. 55 In fact, PPIL4 is the only human cyclophilin that has not retained the catalytic arginine (i.e. Arg55 in hCypA) and, thus, like mimicyp is not expected to be an active PPIase. 55 Interestingly, the catalytic arginine has been replaced with an asparagine in both PPIL4 and mimicyp and we are currently beginning to characterize this human cyclophilin for a comparison.",

            "text": "There are several potential roles that mimicyp may play on the outside of the mature virion. While the putative active site of mimicyp is acidic, the protein as a whole is highly basic (pI\u223c9). Thus, mimicyp could interact with the acidic mimicapsid through a novel interaction, such as its C-terminal basic residues, and help stabilize the mature virion (Figure 1(b) ). Interestingly, both HIV-1 and SARS have been shown to recruit host cell hCypA to their viral surfaces 6, 22 and there is strong evidence to suggest that virally attached hCypA functions to target host cells through its endogenous extracellular receptor, CD147 (i.e. cellular adhesion). 12 Additionally, virally attached hCypA may aid in evading an immune response by the host, analogous to viral incorporation of major histocompatibility complexes. 56 Thus, the Mimivirus may utilize its virally encoded mimicyp for similar functions. For example, mimicyp neutralization of the acidic mimicapsid may block electrostatic repulsion between the virus and the target cell, thereby promoting cellular adhesion and allowing for viral entry. In support of this, the closest phylogenetic homolog to the mimicyp is that to an amoeba cyclophilin, EhCyp, suggesting that close homology to an amoebal host (i.e. A. polyphaga) could allow the Mimivirus to avoid degradation during phagacytosis. This would be analogous to HIV-1 and SARS masking mature virions with host cell hCypA to avert an immune response. However, we were unable to block amoebal infection by either recombinant mimicyp or antimimicyp and the reasons for this are discussed below.",

First, externally bound mimicyp may not be critical for infection of A. polyphaga under our experimental conditions. Cellular adhesion may only be important for amoebal infection under stress conditions or possibly for infection of other amoebal hosts. This would be analogous to the finding that hCypA is only important for HIV-1 infection for certain cell types. 57 Second, since the Mimivirus also infects both murine 58 and human hosts, 17 there could potentially be a cellular receptor targeted by mimicyp for only these organisms, analogous to CD147 targeted by virally \"hijacked\" hCypA. 12 Third, there may be a specific restriction factor within one such host targeted by mimicyp, thereby thwarting an immune response during infection of this particular organism, analogous to owl monkeys that utilize a cyclophilin to avoid HIV-1 infection. For owl monkeys, a chimeric protein is formed between TRIM5a and cyclophilin-A, called TRIMCyp, and binds the HIV-1 capsid resulting in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. 59 Fourth, mimicyp expression during infection may be too high to specifically block by the addition of recombinant protein or antibodies (Figure 6(b) ). Either mutations or deletions of mimicyp within the context of the full Mimivirus will undoubtedly address the importance of this cyclophilin in the viral life cycle, yet the genetic transformation of this virus has proven unsuccessful to date.",
