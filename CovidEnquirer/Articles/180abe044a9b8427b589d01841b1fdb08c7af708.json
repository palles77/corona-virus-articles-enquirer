The core is tubular in appearance and has a morphology indicative of helical nucleocapsid symmetry. The virus possesses an RNA genome since its growth is not affected by DNA nucleotide analogues; actinomycin D and alpha-amanitin on the other hand do inhibit replication, as does UV irradiation of the cells before infection. A unique pattern of viral polypeptides was reported (Horzinek et al., 1984) .",

However, it is obvious that the horse, from which the virus was originally isolated, is not the only host species of Berne virus or antigenically related viruses. The high prevalence of antibody in other ungulates and the previously demonstrated serological relationship of Berne virus with the Breda viruses and Lyon-4 virus (Weiss et al., 1983 ) demonstrated in cattle with diarrhea (Woode et al., 1982) indicate that agents of this new taxonomic cluster may be of significance as pathogens. We have preliminary evidence (from neutralization tests using 31 randomly collected cattle sera) that a Berne-related virus is active also in the Dutch cattle population; in only 3 samples titers were <10 and in 10 sera values of >50 were recorded. Also, cattle sera from Austria (10/10) and the U.S.A. (36/49) showed neutralization in a titer range of 10 to >200 (M. Weiss and M.C. Horzinek, 1983) . Earlier, Steck et al. (1980) have reported similar results from Switzerland.",

In its exclusivity (recognition of determinants on the virion membrane surface), hemagglutination-inhibition is similar to neutralization; ELISA, however, would also detect internal (nucleocapsid) antigens which tend to be evolutionary more conserved and broadly cross-reactive. The discrepancies observed (Table III) in the sense that ELISA-negative horse sera gave positive results in neutralization are explained by the superior sensitivity of the latter test. It can be assumed that in those cases where neutralization-negative sera have been found ELISA-positive, internal virion antigens are detected. Experiments are under way to examine sera from different animal species using ELISA and radioimmune precipitation.",
