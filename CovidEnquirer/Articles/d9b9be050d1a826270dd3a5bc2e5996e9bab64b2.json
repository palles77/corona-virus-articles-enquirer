According to this scheme, 3,5-dimethoxybenzyl bromide, 2-chloromethyl-3, 4-dimethoxy pyridine or 2-chloro-methyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-methoxypyridine were heated with triethyl phosphite in the presence of (n-Bu) 4 NI to give the phosphonates (2-4) (Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction [17] ). In turn, the reaction of aryl aldehyde with the anion of phosphates formed in situ with sodium hydride gave (E)-stilbene derivatives (5-14) (with almost none of (Z)-isomer) together with water soluble diethyl phosphate (Wittig-Horner reaction [18, 19] ). But the yield of pyridine containing derivatives is poor. Further methoxyl derivatives were demethylated with BBr 3 in dichloromethane.",

Only compounds 17 and 19 could inhibit the replication of SARS virus in Vero E6 cells in concentration \u2264 0.5 mg ml -1 (2.05 mM). There was no cytotoxicity to Vero E6 in concentration \u2265 2 mg ml -1 (8.20 mM) ( Table 3 ). It showed that both of them could inhibit SARS virus in vitro.

Compounds 8, 11 and 14 had no inhibition in the evaluation. Although compounds 17 and 19 had one same part, the compound 21 that had the same part showed no activity. It seemed that the whole molecular structure was necessary to the inhibitory activity and hydroxy group was prior to methoxy group. However, the structure-activity relationship was still unclear in our present study. Maybe the further research will reveal the relationship between the substituent and activity (Tables 1 and 2).",
