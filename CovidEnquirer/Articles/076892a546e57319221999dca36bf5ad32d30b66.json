            "text": "Sir, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel infectious disease in humans caused by a coronavirus that was first recognized in Southeast Asia in late February 2003. 1 The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued definitions for probable and suspected cases. 2 Most transmissions occurred by close hospital or household contact with infected individuals suggesting a predominant droplet mode of spread. 3 Widespread use of personal protective equipment (PPE) including N95 respirators is thought to have been instrumental in controlling the epidemic. We report a patient who had had no direct contact with SARS patients and who subsequently transmitted the infection to her intensivist who was wearing standard PPE during a bronchoscopy.",

To our knowledge, fomite spread has not been well documented for SARS, although it has been demonstrated experimentally for other respiratory viral pathogens, and is the probable route of transmission for our patient. Environmental contamination is the most likely route of transmission in Hotel M, which triggered off the worldwide outbreak of SARS 1 and in the large Amoy Gardens outbreak. 4 Transmission to a bronchoscopist has not, to our knowledge, been documented before. During the procedure the doctor wore an N95 mask, glasses, gloves, footwear and disposable gown. However, he was not using specific eye protection and a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) hood, which has become common practice since then.",

This is similar to the experience in Canada in which transmission of SARS to protected healthcare workers occurred during a difficult intubation. 5 We believe that high-risk procedures such as intubation or bronchoscopy may require a higher level of protection than N95 respirators. We also feel that more work needs to be done to establish the role of environmental surfaces in the indirect transmission of the virus to individuals without direct contact. These will be important for future strategies for SARS. ",

Samples were taken from each wing of the Middlesex Hospital and most were obtained from the ground floor, which forms the only common route of access between wings. Swabs were taken from 5 cm 2 areas and these were incubated in nutrient enrichment broth at 37 8C for 48 h and then subcultured on to Colombia blood agar by streak plate method and incubated at 37 8C for 18 h. All Gram-positive cocci identified as catalase positive were identified by standard methods and tested for oxacillin resistance. Three swabs yielded no growth, and organisms were identified from the other 17, including 10 coagulase-negative staphylococci. Of these, three (30%) were resistant to oxacillin. No MRSA were identified. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from two swabs.",
