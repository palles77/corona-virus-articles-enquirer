            "text": "Acute respiratory failure; Immunosuppression; Respiratory viruses; Polymerase chain reaction assay Summary Purpose: Prospective single-center study to assess the sensitivity and clinical relevance of molecular testing for respiratory viruses in critically ill immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Methods: 100 consecutive critically ill immunocompromised patients with ARF in 2007e2009. Among them, 65 had hematologic malignancies (including 14 hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients), 22 had iatrogenic immunosuppression, and 13 had solid malignancies. A multiplex molecular assay (MMA) was added to the usual battery of tests performed to look for causes of ARF. Results: Nasopharyngeal aspirates and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were tested for respiratory viruses using both the MMA and immunofluorescence. A virus was detected in 47 (47%) patients using the MMA and 8 (8%) patients using immunofluorescence (P Z 0.006). MMApositive and MMA-negative patients had similar clinical and radiographic presentations and were not significantly different for the use of ventilatory support (58% vs. 76%, P Z 0.09), occurrence of shock (43% vs. 53%, P Z 0.41), use of renal replacement therapy (26% vs. 23%, P Z 0.92), SAPS II (35 [26e44] vs. 38 [27e50], P Z 0.36), time spent in the ICU (6 vs. 7 Respiratory Medicine (2012) 106, 1184e1191 days, P Z 0.35), or ICU mortality (17% vs. 28%, P Z 0.27). Using MMA, a virus was found in 6 of the 12 patients with no diagnosis at the end of the etiologic investigations. Conclusions: In critically ill immunocompromised patients, an MMA was far more sensitive than immunofluorescence for respiratory virus detection. Patients with RVs detected in the respiratory tract had the same clinical characteristics and outcomes as other patients. \u00aa",

            "text": "Molecular detection of respiratory viruses in immunocopromised ICU patients: Incidence and meaning Introduction Acute respiratory failure (ARF) occurs in up to 50% of patients with malignancies, who are then at high risk for death, particularly if they require mechanical ventilation. 1e4 Respiratory viruses (RVs) are detected in 10%e 20% of these ARF episodes. 5, 6 Together with the bacterial and fungal infections often seen in this setting, RV infections are potentially life-threatening in immunocompromised patients. 7e11 Viral culture has long been considered the reference standard for diagnosing RV infection but usually takes several days to yield results. Antigen detection is faster but less sensitive. 12 Molecular screening based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is fast, more sensitive than earlier test methods, highly specific, and capable of detecting rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, which are missed by other tests. 13 Molecular assays have been reported to improve the diagnostic yield compared with conventional methods during acute respiratory illnesses in patients with hematological malignancies. 14e17 However, they detect only nucleic acids, as opposed to live organisms, and their clinical relevance is therefore unclear. A positive molecular assay on a respiratory sample may indicate viral infection, colonization, or contamination.",

Samples were stored at \u00c080 c. Before extraction, 5 ml of an internal amplification control which contained an encephalomyocarditis virus RNA transcript was added into the sample. Nucleic acids were purified from 400 ml of samples with the EasyMag system (Biom \u00bb rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and eluted in 100 ml of elution buffer, of which 10 were used for amplification. The three steps of pre-amplification, hybridization and ligation-PCR were performed on a C1000 themocycler (Bio-Rad, Marnes la Coquette, France). The amplified MLPA products were analyzed on an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Fragment sizing analysis was performed with the GeneMarker software (SoftGenetics, LLC, State College, PA).",

Thus, in immunocompromised patients with ARF, the MMA may identify patients with probable viral pulmonary involvement, a diagnosis associated with better outcomes than those assumed to be present when all tests are inconclusive. Indeed, negative tests for the cause of ARF constitute a major diagnostic criterion for severe non-infectious conditions such as drugrelated pulmonary toxicity or pulmonary infiltration by the malignancy. Consequently, MMA may deserve to be added to the list of investigations performed routinely to detect the cause of ARF. Isn't so, every effort should be done to make the difference between a positive test and a diagnostic test. In contrast, in the subgroup of patients with lung infections, there were no significant differences between MMA-positive and MMA-negative patients. When there is a known bacterial or fungal lung infection, identifying an RV probably has no major impact on the management strategy or patient outcome.

To gain insight into the clinical significance of a positive MMA, routinely performing the MMA on both BAL fluid and NPA and/or obtaining lung biopsies might have been of interest. Histology can show a cytopathic effect but lacks sensitivity. Positive results are difficult to interpret, and no criteria are available for determining the causal role for the RV in the lung disease. High viral loads are more often accompanied with clinical disease, but low viral loads do not exclude clinical disease due to the virus. Moreover, the pathogenesis of viral infection depends not only on intrinsic viral pathogenicity, but also on genetic host factors such as those involved in the immune response. For rhinoviruses in particular, the clinical manifestations may reflect the immune response to the infection rather than the viral cytopathic effect. 27 ",
