Its molecular epidemiological characterization, particularly the genotyping, was poorly addressed. Methods: The full-length spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and nucleocapsid (N) genes were amplified from each respiratory sample collected from 65 HCoV-OC43-positive patients between 2005 and 2012. Genotypes were determined by phylogenetic analysis. Recombination was analyzed based on full-length viral genome sequences. Clinical manifestations of each HCoV genotype infection were compared by reviewing clinical records. Results: Sixty of these 65 samples belong to genotypes B, C and D. The remaining five strains had incongruent positions in the phylogenetic trees of the S, RdRp and N genes, suggesting a novel genotype emerging, designated as genotype E. Whole genome sequencing and bootscan analysis indicated that genotype E is generated by recombination between genotypes B, C and D. Temporal analysis revealed a sequential genotype replacement of C, B, D and E over the study period with genotype D being the dominant genotype since 2007. The novel genotype E was only detected in children younger than three years suffering from lower respiratory tract infections. Conclusions: Our results suggest that HCoV-OC43 genotypes are evolving. Such genotype shift may be an adapting mechanism for HCoV-OC43 maintaining its epidemic.",

That has led to increased concerns about HCoVs, while the identification of MERS-CoV in 2012 reinforced the public health significance of HCoVs. Although SARS-CoV is no longer detected since 2004, MERS-CoV continued as an epidemic, spreading to more patients and countries. This spread indicates a high adaption capability of MERS-CoV in humans. 5, 6 Insight into the epidemic characteristics of HCoVs at the molecular level will allow us to predict viral pathogenesis and transmission activities and inform HCoV prevention and control, particularly against newly emerging HCoVs.",

The genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 was first reported in Belgium in 2005 and three clusters were identified based on the analysis of the spike (S) gene of the prototype strain ATCC VR-759 and seven clinical strains. 11 Subsequently, Lau et al. gave the first description on the molecular epidemiology of HCoV-OC43 using sequences from 29 clinical samples in 2011. 12 Four genotypes, A, B, C and D, were identified based on the viral genome and the phylogeny of the main structural genes, S, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and nucleocapsid (N) genes, and genotype D was reported to have arisen due to natural recombination. 12 However, these observations were based on only a limited number of HCoV-OC43 positive cases.

The HCoV-OC43 sequences fell into four distinct clusters on the phylogenetic tree of the S gene as reported by Lau et al. 12 However, incongruities were observed in ML trees of RdRp and N genes, indicating genetic diversity. Briefly, OC43 strains identified in this study (designated CN strains) fell into three clusters in S gene, i.e., B, C and D genotypes, similar to those from Hong Kong, China (HK) and Belgium (BE). Eleven CN strains fell into genotype B together with five 2004 HK strains and the Belgium strain BE03. 11, 12 The sequences of this genotype possessed nucleotide (nt) identities of 98.7%e99.6%. Three CN strains and 15 HK strains formed genotype C, possessing 99.6%e99.8% nt identities; while 51 CN strains clustered with nine HK strains and a BE04 strain to form genotype D, possessing 99.3%e100% nt identities. Genotype A contained only the cell culture strain ATCC VR-759 as previously reported. 11, 12 The strains that fell into genotype C clustered together in the ML tree of the RdRp gene, as well as in the ML tree of the S gene. Strains belonging to genotype D clustered together with strains of genotype B, and these sequences possessed 99.7%e99.8% nt identities. Notably, five CN strains (1783A/10, 2058A/10, 2941A/11, 3074A/12 and 3194A/12), which belong to genotype B in the ML tree of the S gene, formed a distinct clade in the tree of RdRp gene. Multiple alignment of RdRp results showed that these five CN strains possessed 99.5e99.6% nt identities to B_BE03, C_HK04-01 and D_HK11-01, while other B strains possessed 99.7e100% nt identities to B_BE03 ( Table 1 ).",

To further demonstrate the emergence of genotype E strains, we amplified the whole viral genome sequences directly from respiratory samples. We obtained the whole genome sequences of four of the five distinct strains (1783A/10, 2058A/10, 3074A/12 and 3194A/12; 2194A/11 was not available due to the very low viral load in the specimen). We then analyzed the potential recombination by constructing the phylogenetic trees of all known 23 gene regions of these four strains. Ten other whole genome sequences of OC43 were used as reference strains, including BE03 and 2145A/10 (genotype B), HK04-01 and 3647/06 (genotype C), BE04, HK04-02 and 5240/07 (genotype D), and the ATCC strain (genotype A) (Fig. 2) . Bovine CoV (accession no. U00735) was used as outgroup sequence, which was not displayed in the figure to save spaces. We found that these four strains form a separate linage (genotype E) in the phylogenetic trees of complete genome, S, RdRp and most of the nonstructual protein (nsp) genes.

            "text": "Recombination is a common phenomenon among coronaviruses. A special random template switching mechanisms can be used during RNA replication. 23, 24 The high frequency of homologous recombination together with the high mutation rates of the genome may lead to the adaptation of CoVs and allow the generation of new strains and genotypes. 25e29 For example, recombination has been reported to generate new genotypes and to contribute to the genetic diversity in HCoV-HKU1 and -NL63, with recombination sites on nsp6/nsp7, nsp16/HE, and nsp3, and the S genes, respectively. 17, 26 Our work, which included a larger number of samples over a longer surveillance period than previous studies, shows that a novel genotype E emerged in 2010. This highlights again the role of recombination in the evolution of HCoV-OC43. Based on nucleotide identity comparison, phylogenetic analysis of different genes, and boot scanning analysis, genotype E might be generated from a recombination between genotypes B, C and D. Potential recombination sites may be at the junctions of nsp2/nsp3, nsp6/nsp7, nsp9/ nsp10, nsp12/nsp13, ns5a/E and M/N gene. However, these observations need to be clarified based on more whole genome sequences of OC43. In addition, our results together with those of previous reports on the recombination analysis of HCoVs, indicate that the amplification of genes including at least nsp2/nsp3, nsp12/nsp13 (corresponding to pol gene) and the S and N genes is needed for genotyping and recombination analysis. 12, 20, 26 The association of HCoV-OC43 genotypes with disease severity has not been well defined. A previous study found that among eight genotype D positive patients, seven were diagnosed with pneumonia. 12 However, in our study, genotype D showed no associations with severe symptoms, as most of the patients suffered from URTIs. This difference in results may be attributed to the studied cohort and number of positive cases. However, host immune pressure in response to genotype D during a long epidemic period may also affect virulence.",

This association may require further investigations for a larger number of samples.

Genotype D, generated from recombination and first identified in 2004, was the dominant genotype for epidemics starting in 2007.
