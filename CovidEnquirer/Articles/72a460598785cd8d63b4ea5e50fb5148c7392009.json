            "text": "The aim of this research was to evaluate the influence of maternal cells from colostrum on the development and function of the innate immune response in Holstein calves. Calves were divided into 2 groups: COL+ (n = 10) received fresh colostrum; and COL\u2212 (n = 10) which received frozen colostrum containing no viable cells. The calves were assessed before colostrum intake (D0), 48 h of age (D2), and weekly from D7 up to D28. Blood samples were collected for analysis of the distribution of leukocytes, cellular phenotype and in vitro granulocyte function. COL + calves tended to have a high number of neutrophils on D7 (p = 0.073). COL \u2212 calves took up significantly more Escherichia coli (measured as MFI) on D7 (p = 0.034). Endogenous production of radicals (as percentage of cells) tended to be higher in COL\u2212 calves on D14 (p = 0.061). The intensity of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by granulocytes tended to be higher in COL+ calves on D21 (p = 0.094). Overall, ROS production (percent of cells, and MFI) induced by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were higher in COL+ calves than COL\u2212 calves. It was our observation that COL+ calves developed an innate immune response more quickly and efficiently after natural exposure to pathogens after birth. In contrast, COL\u2212 calves mounted an innate response more slowly that yielded a persistent inflammatory response after natural exposure to these bacteria agents. This research provides evidence of an advantage to the calf of receiving fresh colostrum on the development and function of the innate immune system.",

Cold storage facilities are common on dairy farms and the use of frozen colostrum is on the increase. Freezing results in virtually no loss of basic nutrients (protein, energy and antibody) during storage, but requires extra handling and careful thawing for proper activity (Stieler et al., 2012) . The immunoglobulin content of colostrum has been shown to be unaffected by the freezing process. However, the maternal leukocytes are lysed during freezing and thaw, and lost (Novo et al., 2014; Langel et al., 2015) .",

However, the relative number of bacteria taken up by each granulocyte (expressed as MFI) was higher in COL \u2212 calves on D7 than the COL + calves ( Fig. 2A and B) . This fact points out that granulocytes from COL \u2212 calves took up a larger number of bacteria into the cytoplasm. Stieler et al. (2012) found a trend toward a higher fraction of phagocytic cells taking up Escherichia coli in calves fed with frozen than fresh colostrum compared to frozen colostrum on D2 after birth However, the number of bacteria per cell was similar between the treatment groups. Our experiment agrees with Stieler et al. (2012) that the percent of phagocytic cells was higher in calves fed frozen colostrum. Stieler et al. (2012) believed that cytokines and/or transfer factor (and products of cells destroyed by freezing and thawing colostrum) were likely to be responsible for the difference observed between groups. In our view, the difference between COL + and COL \u2212 calves is mediated by the reduced capacity of COL \u2212 calves to clear bacteria after birth, in part due to their reduced capacity to reach the target tissue, resulting in a prolonged inflammatory response.",

Further, COL + calves tended to produce more ROS per cell on D21 than COL \u2212 calves (Fig. 3B) . The fraction of cells producing ROS after Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli stimulation was essentially unchanged in both groups over the course of the study when considering the variation in measurements overall ( Fig. 3C and E) . The production of ROS per cells after stimulating with Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli was also very similar for calves in both groups. The cellular production of ROS was lower at birth for calves in both treatment groups on D0 after Staphylococcus aureus stimulation than during the rest of the study in each group (Fig. 3D) . Cellular ROS production after Escherichia coli stimulation did not really change during the study (Fig. 3F) . Riedel-Caspari and Schmidt (1991) reported that bacterial stress after birth of colostrum cell deprived calves induced an increased number of circulating neutrophils on D2 that showed an association with a higher index of Streptococcus agalactiae phagocytosis index for colostrum cell deprived calves on D5 relative to those receiving whole colostrum.
