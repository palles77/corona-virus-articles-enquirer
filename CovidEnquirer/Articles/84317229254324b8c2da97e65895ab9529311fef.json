Characterising the human immune response to infection is essential for identifying correlates of protection and for developing suitable animal models for vaccine development; an important component of this work is the collection of blood from survivors. Collection of appropriate volumes of antibodyrich serum from survivors are essential for the international standards and assays that are needed for vaccine (and diagnostic test) development, testing, and release, and for comparing one product (or even vaccine lot) with another. Similarly, specimen processing to obtain and analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells, although a more labour intensive process, is pivotal for the isolation and identification of light-chain and heavychain antibody sequences and the development of recombinant antibodies. Such specimens can also be used for the development of rapid diagnostic tests, vaccine design, therapeutics, and for the identification of correlates of protection, which can be useful as surrogate endpoints in vaccine trials. Validated measures of immune response are required before any regulatory authorisation for vaccine use can be granted. Such measures do not currently exist for Lassa virus, MERS-CoV, or Nipah virus, CEPI's initial priority patho gens, nor will they exist for the hypothetical Disease X. Ideally, the scientific community should agree on priorities for specimen analysis in advance of an outbreak, and the collection and distribution effort should be designed to serve the needs of vaccine, diagnostics, and therapeutics developers. However, if a disease outbreak occurs and consensus on an analysis plan has not been reached, specimens could be safely processed and stored, maintaining a chain of custody in a national or regional biobank until the outbreak has ended and a scientific consensus on their analysis can be achieved.",

Understanding of how to better prevent and control many of these diseases will only be possible through targeted epidemiological studies during outbreaks. Establishing the baseline incidence, seroprevalence, and transmission dynamics of the target disease, deter mining the role of vectors and potential need for animal vaccines, identifying disease hotspots, elucidating seasonal patterns of exposure, understanding the full clinical spectrum of illness, and having a validated widely shared case definition that can serve as a trial endpoint will facilitate planning for and increase the efficiency of clinical trials done both in the interepidemic period and during an outbreak. Given the sporadic and unpredictable occurrence of outbreaks, the study designs suitable to different prototypes of transmission dynamics, and infrastructure must be in place and tested before an outbreak begins. Even if vaccines are licensed through alternative pathways, such as the US Food and Drug Administration's Animal Efficacy Rule, post-licensure effec tiveness data will need to be generated during outbreaks. Doing epidemiological studies in populations at risk before the implementation of clinical trials will also strengthen local research capacity and facilitate community engagement, which in turn might result in better enrolment in vaccine effectiveness studies.",

Our goal in this paper is to highlight the research areas that are central to vaccine development and important subsets of outbreak response activities. Because planning is central to any disease outbreak research effort, CEPI has begun to identify and support preparedness activities that will enable a rapid research response in areas essential for vaccine devel opment, even before vaccine candidates are ready for human trials.",

The activities outlined in the table should be viewed as necessary to initiate or accelerate vaccine development but they might also be useful in clarifying whether, and how far, vaccine development should proceed. Given the magnitude of investment needed to develop a new vaccine and take it to licensure, CEPI anticipates that its early funding of these types of activities will be essential for rapid decisionmaking processes involving a wide range of global stakeholders.
