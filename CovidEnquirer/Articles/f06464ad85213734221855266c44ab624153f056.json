The impact of respiratory co-infection in SOTR with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) is unknown. A multicentre prospective study of consecutive cases of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) in SOTR was carried out to assess the clinical characteristics and outcome and the risk factors for co-infection. Overall, 51 patients were included. Median time from transplant was 3.7 years, 5.9% of the cases occurred perioperatively and 7.8% were hospitalacquired. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 15 (29.4%) patients. Ten cases were severe (19.6%): 13.7% were admitted to intensive care units, 5.9% suffered septic shock, 5.9% developed acute graft rejection and 7.8% died. Co-infection was detected in 15 patients (29.4%): eight viral, six bacterial and one fungal. Viral co-infection did not affect the outcome. Patients with non-viral co-infection had a worse outcome: longer hospital stay (26.2 \u00b1 20.7 vs. 5.5 \u00b1 10.2) and higher rate of severe diseases (85.7% vs. 2.3%) and mortality (42.8% vs.",

Other factors associated with severe influenza were: delayed antiviral therapy, diabetes mellitus, time since transplantation <90 days and pneumonia. In conclusion, pandemic influenza A can cause significant direct and indirect effects in SOTR, especially in the early post-transplant period, and should be treated early. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of non-viral co-infection, mainly in diabetic patients and severe cases. An effort should be made to prevent influenza with immunization of the patient and the environment.",

In the same way, we found that 8% of the pandemic influenza cases were hospital-acquired. Hospitalacquired influenza infection in SOTR, even in the early postoperative period, and the adverse outcomes in cases occurring within the first 3 months after the transplant, prompt some considerations. First, early influenza diagnosis and treatment should be considered in the presence of influenzalike symptoms, especially in cases of pneumonia, in pandemic or seasonal influenza periods, even in the immediate posttransplant period. Secondly, these patients should be considered a high-risk population, and therefore measures to avoid in-hospital transmission should be rigorous, with implementation of infection control measures, such as isolation of infected patients, and avoidance of contact with symptomatic caregivers. In this sense, it is necessary to increase the rate of vaccination among SOTR and close contacts to confer indirect protection for those who are non-responders to vaccine.",

In this study, two associated factors at influenza diagnosis have been identified: diabetes mellitus and septic shock. On the other hand, non-viral co-infections were not diagnosed in mild cases without pneumonia. These findings may suggest that nonsevere cases could be managed without antibacterial therapy, reducing the number of patients exposed to antibiotics, in our case two-thirds of the patients.",
