We studied the dispersion of exhaled air through a simple oxygen mask applied to a human patient simulator (HPS) during the delivery of different oxygen flow in a room free of air currents. Methods: The HPS represented a 70-kg adult male individual in a semi-sitting position on a hospital bed inclined at 45 o . A simple oxygen mask was fitted to the HPS in the normal fashion. The head, neck, and internal airways of the HPS were configured to allow realistic airflow modeling in the airways and around the face. The HPS was programmed to breathe at a respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 0.5 L. Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. A leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light-sheet, and images were captured by high-resolution video. Smoke concentration in the exhaled plume was estimated from the total light intensity scattered by smoke particles. Findings: A jet plume of air leaked through the side vents of the simple oxygen mask to lateral distances of 0.2, 0.22, 0.3, and 0.4 m from the sagittal plane during the delivery of oxygen at 4, 6, 8, and 10 L/min, respectively. Coughing could extend the dispersion distance beyond 0.4 m. Conclusion: Substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs generally within 0.4 m from patients receiving supplemental oxygen via a simple mask. Health-care workers should take precautions when managing patients with community-acquired pneumonia of unknown etiology that is complicated by respiratory failure. (CHEST 2007; 132:540 -546)",

The use of a nebulizer in an overcrowded medical ward with inadequate ventilation was thought to be the cause of a major nosocomial outbreak of SARS in our hospital in 2003. 4 -6 Influenza virus A/H5N1 has become the major emerging infectious disease of global concern since late 2003. The widespread occurrence of the H5N1 avian influenza infection in poultry and birds on several continents has increased the risk of human exposure to avian influenza. Respiratory failure is the major complication in patients who are hospitalized with influenza A/H5N1 infection, and many patients progress rapidly to ARDS and multiorgan failure. 7 As part of our influenza pandemic preparedness, we studied the safety of oxygen therapy by examining exhaled air dispersion from a simple oxygen mask attached to a human patient simulator (HPS) during the delivery of oxygen at different levels of flow.",

The HPS contains a realistic airway and a lung model that undergoes gas exchange (ie, it removes oxygen and adds carbon dioxide to the system). The lung compliance and airway resistance also respond in a realistic manner to relevant challenges. In addition, the HPS produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo human situation and has been applied in previous studies 9 -13 to simulate human respiration. In this study, we set the lung compliance and oxygen consumption of the HPS to 35 mL/cm H 2 O and 350 mL/min, respectively. This represented a patient with mild lung injury. 14, 15 Tidal volume and respiratory rate were regulated so that a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.8 was maintained during the measurements. In this setting, the HPS breathed at a respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 0.5 L.

It mixed with alveolar gas and then was exhaled through the airway. Jet plume leakage in sections was then revealed using a thin laser light-sheet that was created by an Nd:YVO 4 Q-switched, frequency-doubled laser (OEM T20-BL 10 -106Q; Spectra Physics, Inc; Mountain View, CA) with custom-made cylindrical optics for two-dimensional laser light-sheet generation. 8 The experiments were recorded with a video system (DV video system [3 charge-coupled device, \u03eb48 zoom, 30-Hz]; Sony; Tokyo, Japan). The laser light-sheet (green, 527-nm wavelength, in TEM 00 mode) was adjusted to encompass the largest crosssection of the entire leakage jet plume. The light-sheet was initially positioned in the median sagittal plane of the HPS and was subsequently shifted to the paramedian planes.

We assumed that the intensity of the laser light-sheet was near constant because the oxygen mask was positioned relatively far from the light-sheet optics (ie, the point of divergence). The laser light scattered by the smoke particles was then collected and integrated by the video camera chargecoupled device elements. For a small region, the number of smoke particles within the region (or particle concentration) is proportional to the total scattered light intensity in that corresponding region.

While the HPS was breathing oxygen at 6 L/min, cough was produced by a short burst (2 s, 400 L/min) of air (marked by smoke) generated by a jet ventilator connected to the proximal trachea. This represented cough efforts in a patient with mild lung injury. 16 Although the video camera was not able to capture the maximum dispersion distance beyond 0.4 m for contours of \u03fe 20%, the leakage plume through the side vent of the simple mask was noted to stretch to distances of 0.4 and 0.2 m lateral to the median sagittal plane for contours of \u03fe 25% and \u03fe 60%, respectively.

These findings have important clinical implications for the health-care workers who often manage patients with respiratory failure due to CAP of unknown etiology at a short distance. It is important to provide adequate respiratory protection for the health-care workers, in addition to applying standard, contact, and droplet precautions in order to prevent nosocomial infections. During the major outbreak of SARS in 2003, respiratory failure was the major complication in the second week of the illness, when about half of the patients required supplemental oxygen in order to maintain satisfactory oxygenation. 25 Health-care workers were particularly vulnerable to SARS as the viral load of SARS coronavirus in patients increased to peak level on day 10 of the illness. 26 A case-control study 27 involving 124 medical wards in 26 hospitals in Guangzhou and Hong Kong has identified SARS patients requiring oxygen therapy or NPPV as independent risk factors for superspreading nosocomial outbreaks of SARS. While the major routes for the transmission of SARS were related to infected droplets and fomites, as is usually the case in patients with viral pneumonia, 28 there was evidence that SARS might have been spread by airborne transmission. 29 -32 It was not entirely clear whether different modalities of respiratory support had contributed to the nosocomial outbreaks of SARS through the generation of infective aerosols, but our previous study 8 showed that substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within a 0.5-m radius of patients who are receiving NPPV.",

The inertia and weight of larger droplets in an air-droplet, two-phase flow would certainly cause them to have less horizontal dispersion than the continuous air carrier phase in which they traveled. However, the evaporation of water content in some droplets during oxygen therapy may produce droplet nuclei that are suspended in air, whereas the larger droplets will fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway. As the smoke particles in this study mark the continuous air phase, our data contours refer to exhaled air. Our results would represent the \"upper bound\" estimates for the dispersion of droplets that would be expected to follow a shorter trajectory than the air jet due to gravitational effects, but would not fully reflect the risk of droplet transmission. 8 Second, the room airflow was switched off during the experiment in order to reveal the maximum distribution of exhaled air without interference by external factors. Further work is needed to assess the interaction between ward ventilation and the dispersion distances related to oxygen therapy. Last, we were unable to capture the maximum dispersion distance during coughing due to the limitation of the equipment used in this study.
