            "text": "The primary objective of this randomized controlled challenge study was to investigate the effect of ampicillin on ultrasonographic (US) lung consolidation after experimental challenge with Pasteurella multocida in preweaned dairy calves. The secondary objectives were to determine whether ampicillin affected respiratory score, gross consolidation, or the detection of P. multocida in lung tissue at postmortem exam (PME). Holstein bull calves (n = 39) were transported to the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine isolation facility at the mean (\u00b1SD) age of 52 \u00b1 6 d. After a 7-d acclimation period, 30 calves were inoculated intratracheally with 10 10 cfu of ampicillinsensitive P. multocida. Lung US and respiratory scoring were performed 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-challenge, then US once daily and respiratory scoring twice daily until d 14. Calves were randomized to receive ampicillin [n = 17, treatment (TX), 6.6 mg/kg i.m. once daily for 3 d] or placebo [n = 11, control (CON), saline, equal volume, i.m. once daily for 3 d] when \u22651 cm 2 of lung consolidation was observed and \u22656 h had elapsed since challenge. Lung lesions \u22651 cm 2 were considered positive for consolidation. Calves were respiratory score positive if \u22652 in 2 or more categories based on the Wisconsin respiratory health score chart. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for US score and respiratory score as a proxy for time with consolidation and clinical respiratory disease, respectively. Gross lung lesions and pathogens were quantified following PME. At the time of first treatment, consolidation had developed in 28/30 calves (TX, n = 17; CON, n = 11) and 6% (1 out of 17) of TX and 9% (1 out of 11) of CON calves had a positive respiratory score. The TX calves had a significantly lower median (interquartile range given in parentheses) AUC for US score [TX: 23 (20, 29), CON: 47 (33, 53)], whereas mean AUC for respiratory score was not different between groups (TX: 93 \u00b1 28, CON: 96 \u00b1 17). On d 14, 70% (12 out of 17) of TX and 100% (11 out of 11) of CON calves had lung consolidation, and 24% (4 out of 17) of TX and 27% (3 out of 11) of CON calves had clinical respiratory disease. On PME, median consolidation was 10% (6, 15) for TX and 10% (2, 28) for CON calves. Lung cultures were positive for P. multocida in 77% (13 out of 17) of TX and 91% (10 out of 11) of CON calves. Lung health benefited from a 3-d ampicillin therapy, but benefits were short-lived. Treatment failures might be due to incomplete resolution of the initial lung infection. Future studies are needed to optimize TX strategies to improve long-term lung health.",

Although macrolide, phenicol, and fluoroquinolone products are commonly used for treating nonlactating cattle, none of these are approved for use in lactating dairy cattle (female cattle 20 mo of age or older). Conversely, ampicillin trihydrate (Polyflex, Boehringer Ingelheim, Duluth, GA) has FDA approval for the treatment of respiratory disease in lactating dairy cattle. Ampicillin provides bactericidal activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, more specifically Pasteurella multocida, a common bacterial agent associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD; Dabo et al., 2007) .",

Ultrasound can evaluate the extent of lung consolidation and is a reliable method of confirming bronchopneumonia in calves with or without clinical signs of BRD (Ollivett and Buczinski, 2016 ). An additional aim of the study was to determine whether antibiotic treatment would alter the likelihood of isolating bacterial pathogens in lung tissue at PME. Ampicillin trihydrate was selected because of its FDA approval status and frequent use in lactating dairy cattle with respiratory disease. Given the relatively low rates of clinical respiratory disease in lactating cattle, a challenge model using calves could provide information regarding lung response to therapy in a more efficient and cost-effective manner than a field trial in lactating cattle.",

Calves with respiratory scores \u22652 in 2 or more categories were considered positive (clinical). Fever was defined as a temperature score 3 (\u226539.4\u00b0C), and high fever was a temperature \u226540\u00b0C. Regarding lung US, left and right lung fields were scanned, and images were interpreted using a 0 to 5 US lung score, as previously described (Ollivett and Buczinski, 2016 ). An US score 0 indicates normal aerated lung, with no consolidation and minimal comet-tail artifact (Ollivett and Buczinski, 2016) . A score 1 signifies diffuse comet-tail artifact without consolidation (Ollivett and Buczinski, 2016) . When \u22651 cm 2 of lung consolidation develops, an US score of 2 is assigned (Ollivett and Buczinski, 2016) . Scores of 3, 4, and 5 represent 1, 2, and 3 or more completely consolidated lung lobes, respectively (Ollivett and Buczinski, 2016) .Calves received the score corresponding to their most significant lesion. The depth and dorsal-to-ventral extent of consolidated lung were measured within each intercostal space using the 1-cm grid lines on the US screen (Ibex Pro, E. I. Medical, Loveland, CO). For the purpose of this study, a normal lung US was score 0 or 1; \u22651 cm 2 consolidation, a score \u22652; and severe consolidation, a score \u22653. Of the 45 calves, 39 remained respiratory score negative with a normal lung US and did not receive treatment for diarrhea or respiratory disease, thus meeting inclusion criteria for the study. These calves (n = 39) were transported from the source farm to the university isolation facility at the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) age of 52 \u00b1 6 d. Upon arrival, the calves were weighed and had 2 deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNPS) collected for respiratory pathogen analysis. One swab was placed in M6 viral transport medium, and the other in Amies bacterial transport medium.

A second comparable challenge study showed that the percentage of abnormal lung surface ranged from 0.4% to 39%, with a mean of 14.5% \u00b1 11.6, relatively similar to the 10% observed in the current study (Reinhold et al., 2002) .",

In the current study, combined bacteriological findings from DNPS and lung tissue samples support that P. multocida was responsible for the development of bacterial bronchopneumonia among study calves. Pasteurella multocida is often isolated from nasal secretions and deep pharyngeal swabs in young calves, and it has been reported that isolation rates in clinically normal cattle can be as high as 60% (Dabo et al., 2007) . As shown by our data, clinically normal calves can have subclinical bronchopneumonia; therefore, isolation rates for pathogens in apparently healthy cattle should be interpreted with caution unless lung US is used to confirm that the lungs are ultrasonographically healthy. Additionally, it has been documented that not all clinical cures are due to antibiotic administration (DeDonder and Apley, 2015) . A certain level of clinical spontaneous recovery is expected due to fully competent and successful immune response (DeDonder and Apley, 2015) . We must keep in mind, however, that clinical spontaneous recovery does not equal bacteriologic cure within the parenchyma of the lung. Our results show disparity in the proportion of calves with clinical respiratory disease at the end of the study compared with those with US consolidation, meaning that calves seemingly free from clinical disease may not actually be recovered.",

However, the sensitivity of attitude score alone was poor, at 23% (Cramer, 2018) . Such studies highlight the difficulty of using typical \"sickness behavior\" of depressed attitude, fever, and increased respiratory rate alone to diagnose bronchopneumonia in preweaned dairy calves. Our study highlights the challenge of identifying the point at which to treat with antibiotics using clinical signs alone. This is emphasized by the fact that respiratory disease developed shortly after infection, as determined by lung consolidation on US, but the onset of clinical signs was variable.",

It is plausible that once antibiotic therapy was withdrawn, bacterial replication resumed, ultimately leading to treatment failure. In this case, treatment failure could be defined as the presence of consolidated lung and viable pathogen diagnosed during PME. Our study design eliminated common causes of treatment failures such as chronic cases, inappropriate antibiotic spectrum, antibiotic resistance, and poor compliance. It is more probable that suboptimal antibiotic dose, duration, or frequency of administration contributed to treatment failures in this study.",

In human medicine, the emphasis on duration of therapy is driven by the need to balance therapeutic efficacy with minimizing exposure, in an attempt to curb the development of antibiotic resistance. The label for ampicillin trihydrate indicates that dairy cattle should be treated at a dose of 4.4 to 11 mg/kg i.m. every 24 h. Treatment should continue 2 to 3 d after the animal becomes afebrile but no longer than 7 d. In accordance with the human literature and what is practical on farm, we chose to treat calves for a short 3-d duration, with the ability to continue treatment for an additional 2 d if the calves remained febrile (>39.7\u00b0C) and displayed severe clinical signs of respiratory disease, such as moderate to severe nasal or ocular discharge or spontaneous cough 24 h past the last treatment. A 24-h post-treatment interval has classically been assumed for antibiotics requiring daily administration for BRD, such as ampicillin trihydrate (Apley, 2015) . None of the calves in the TX group were eligible for prolonged therapy based on these guidelines. For the purposes of this study, a dose of ampicillin at the middle of the label range (6.6 mg/kg) was used to determine whether judicious antibiotic use would still lead to clinical and US improvement and ultimately bacteriologic cures. For time-dependent antibiotics, such as ampicillin, the most significant factor determining their efficacy is the length of time that serum concentrations exceed the MIC of a given pathogen (Gigu\u00e9re et al., 2013) . Increasing the concentration of the drug severalfold above the MIC does not significantly increase the rate of microbial killing; however, more frequent dosing that will ensure adequate coverage throughout a 24-h period may increase the bactericidal activity (Gigu\u00e9re et al., 2013 ). An early study looking at the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of ampicillin trihydrate in healthy ruminant calves at a dose of 7.7 mg/kg i.m. revealed a maximum plasma concentration of 3.7 \u03bcg/ mL approximately 1 h after administration, with a halflife of 3.8 h (Nouws et al., 1982) . If we extrapolate this data to our study, where MIC \u22640.25 \u03bcg/mL for P. multocida, the plasma concentration of ampicillin would have dropped below the MIC in approximately 15 h. The purpose of our study was not to assess the pharmacokinetic properties of ampicillin, but it does emphasize that further research is needed to determine whether increasing the dose or frequency of ampicillin administration could lead to more sustained lung health. Perhaps if we used the highest label dose and based duration of therapy on US resolution of consolidation, as opposed to clinical respiratory signs, we would have had better treatment success.",

Although significant increases in respiratory rates have been consistently found in previous P. multocida challenge studies, results have been mixed regarding how this correlates with pathological and morphological changes in the lung (Reinhold et al., 2002; Dagleish et al., 2010) . Respiratory rate analysis would have been more subjective in our population of calves, given that they were group housed and we restrained all calves for respiratory scoring. Handling the calves increased their activity level and may have falsely elevated their respiratory rates. Respiratory rate analysis would have been more beneficial if taken from outside the pen while the calves were resting. Another limitation was that coronavirus was detected in calves on the last day of the study in both DNPS and lung tissue. Respiratory BoCV is associated with mild respiratory disease (coughing, rhinitis) or interstitial pneumonia in 2-to 6-month-old calves (Saif, 2010) . Respiratory coinfections and immunosuppression are potential cofactors that can enhance virus shedding (Saif, 2010) . It is possible that some of our study calves may have been infected with BoCV and shedding virus below detectable levels when tested before challenge, and the stress of the P. multocida pneumonia stimulated increased shedding of viral particles. An aim of this study was to improve our understanding of bovine lung response to antibiotic therapy after a bacterial respiratory infection, but the calf challenge model limits the generalizability of our results. The pathophysiology of respiratory disease in calves versus adults may vary due to differences in immune responsiveness, pathogen load, and environmental conditions. Although our results provide valuable insight into the effect of antibiotic treatment for BRD in preweaned calves, field trials are warranted to determine the effect of antibiotic treatment in adult dairy cattle with respiratory disease.",

Opportunity exists to use this technique for early detection of pneumonia, as well as to define recovery from respiratory disease in both the farm and research setting.
