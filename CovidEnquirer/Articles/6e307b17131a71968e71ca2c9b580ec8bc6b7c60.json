Methods: Acute care hospitals in Ontario were surveyed regarding their pandemic influenza preparedness plans. Results: The response rate was 78.5%, and 95 of 121 hospitals participated. Three quarters (76.8%, 73 of 95) of hospitals had pandemic influenza plans. Only 16.4% (12 of 73) of hospitals with plans had tested them. Larger (x 2 5 6.7, P 5 .01) and urban hospitals (x 2 5 5.0, P 5 .03) were more likely to have tested their plans. 70.4% (50 of 71) Of respondents thought the pandemic influenza planning process was not adequately funded. No respondents were ''very satisfied'' with the completeness of their hospital's pandemic plan, and only 18.3% were ''satisfied.'' Conclusion: Important challenges were identified in pandemic planning: one quarter of hospitals did not have a plan, few plans were tested, key players were not involved, plans were frequently incomplete, funding was inadequate, and small and rural hospitals were especially disadvantaged. If these problems are not addressed, the result may be increased morbidity and mortality when a virulent influenza pandemic hits.",

            "text": "The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and threats of avian and pandemic influenza generated considerable interest in preparedness for severe respiratory infectious diseases prior to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. [1] [2] [3] In July 2009, the H1N1 pandemic influenza virus was viewed by the World Health Organization to be of moderate virulence, with similarities to seasonal influenza. Investigation of swine-origin H1N1 influenza viruses, however, found them to be more virulent and pathogenic than seasonal influenza, indicating that the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic could become more virulent and pathogenic. 4 It is estimated an influenza pandemic of mild to moderate virulence with a modest attack rate of 15% would tax the Canadian health care system and result in 18,000 deaths, 64,000 hospitalizations, and 2.1 million patients seeking outpatient care. 2 An attack rate of 35% would overwhelm Canadian hospitals. 2 Ontario acute care hospitals currently operate at over 90% capacity, and it is projected that an influenza pandemic will overburden bed, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity. 3 A survey of Canadian nurses found a perceived shortage of medical equipment and supplies such as ventilators and bedding and a lack of support for health care workers in a large scale respiratory outbreak. 5 American hospitals also operate near capacity and lack the surge capacity necessary to manage an influenza pandemic. 6 Infection control professionals in the United States reported that acute care hospitals were not prepared for large scale infectious outbreaks and that there will be shortages of health care workers and medical equipment and supplies. 7 The suboptimal level of infection prevention and control resources in Canadian, American, and international acute care hospitals will be rate limiting in the face of a significant outbreak or pandemic of a severe respiratory illness. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Hospitals will be expected to play a leadership role in the management of a virulent influenza pandemic. When a pandemic of moderate to high severity strikes, there will be little time to prepare, and hospitals need to develop and test pandemic plans for respiratory infections and stockpile resources. This paper examines the pandemic influenza planning process in acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada. The ultimate goal of the project was to develop a pandemic preparedness learning portal for acute care hospital staff involved in pandemic planning and health care workers.",

The cover letter was signed by representatives of the 3 parties involved in the study: Queen's University, The Change Foundation, and the Ontario Hospital Association. The project had an advisory committee, which comprised infection control, emergency management, and public health experts. The survey was to be directed to and completed by the person most responsible for developing their hospital's pandemic influenza plan. The needs assessment survey was based on the core components of the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan 2 and the Ontario Health Plan for Pandemic Influenza. 3 The domains evaluated included the following: pandemic influenza plan development, command and control roles and responsibilities, human resources, equipment and supplies, infection control and occupational health, triage and clinical care, security, transportation, mortuary issues, business continuity, training and educational strategies, communications, cooperation with local and regional agencies, and opinion regarding pandemic preparedness learning portal development. An analysis of the content of the pandemic influenza plans of Ontario acute care hospitals is presented in a separate paper (Zoutman DE, Ford BD, Melinyshyn M, Schwartz B.

Generic emergency plans are not designed to manage an influenza pandemic, which may have multiple waves each lasting months. One quarter of Ontario's hospitals did not have a specific pandemic influenza plan. Although most generic emergency plans have been formally tested, less than one fifth of pandemic influenza plans had been tested in the hospitals that had them. The testing of plans is an integral component of effective planning that allows for the determination of what works and what needs to be modified. 1, 2 The lack of testing of pandemic influenza plans means that, if H1N1 virulence increases, Ontario's hospitals might not be optimally prepared to manage the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.",

Additional resources for developing and testing pandemic influenza plans need to be made available to small and rural hospitals. Staff in small and rural hospitals often have multiple roles and responsibilities and may lack expertise in pandemic planning. Staff responsible for pandemic influenza planning in all hospitals and especially small and rural hospitals would benefit from ready access to education and training in pandemic planning. Respondents in the present study identified the challenges of small and rural hospitals as a top priority for a pandemic influenza preparedness learning portal. The authors in conjunction with an advisory panel and expert contributors used the results of this project to guide the development of an open access pandemic preparedness learning portal to educate staff responsible for pandemic influenza planning in acute care hospitals (www.pandemicportal.ca). Special attention was paid to the needs of small and rural hospitals. Hospitals cannot manage influenza pandemics in isolation; they should be involved in the formulation of community pandemic plans and initiate liaisons with facilities and organizations in their catchment areas to become part of an overall management plan. 1 Whereas local public health units were involved in the development of most hospitals' pandemic plans, only 40% of hospitals were involved in the development of public health unit pandemic plans. Less than 40% of hospitals collaborated with other local facilities, and only one fifth coordinated clinical services during a pandemic with facilities in bordering jurisdictions. In the event of a pandemic, acute care hospitals will need to coordinate activities with municipal governments and local long-term care facilities, yet less than one third of hospitals had involved these parties in the development of hospital pandemic influenza plans. Even key internal hospital participants such as union representatives and board directors were involved in the development of less than one fifth of hospital pandemic plans. Hospitals need to place greater emphasis on collaborating with key regional, external, and internal stakeholders in the pandemic influenza planning process.",

Respondents from small and rural hospitals were even more likely to report that the planning process was under funded and were more dissatisfied with the completeness of their hospital's plan than those from large and urban hospitals. Lack of funding and dissatisfaction with hospital pandemic plan completeness were associated. There is a need for increased funding for the development of pandemic influenza plans, and funding is especially a problem for small and rural hospitals.",

To improve the pandemic influenza planning process in Ontario's acute care hospitals will necessitate funding for plan development and testing and the fostering of planning expertise in hospital staff charged with the task of developing pandemic influenza plans. In our current environment and if this is not addressed, the result may be increased morbidity and mortality when a virulent influenza pandemic hits.",
