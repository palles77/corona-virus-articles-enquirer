Previous studies have described the general pathology in the lungs of SARS patients and have identified some of the cell types infected by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However , at the time of this writing , there were no comprehensive reports of the cellular distribution of the virus in lung tissue. In this study , we have performed double labeling combining in situ hybridization with immunohistochemistry and alternating each of these techniques separately in consecutive sections to evaluate the viral distribution on various cell types in the lungs of seven patients affected with SARS. We found that SARS-CoV was present in bronchial epithelium, type I and II pneumocytes, T lymphocytes, and macrophages/monocytes. For pneumocytes, T lymphocytes, and macrophages, the infection rates were calculated. In addition, our present study is the first to demonstrate infection of endothelial cells and fibroblasts in SARS. ( The outbreak of a seemingly new infectious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with a mortality of \u03f310%, caused the death of 774 individuals (World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/ table2004_04_21/en/index.html). The majority of SARS patients showed severe lower respiratory symptoms, chiefly with a dry cough and progressive dyspnea, with respiratory failure as the major cause of death. 1 Previous reports have demonstrated significant pathological changes in lung tissues of SARS patients, such as diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, and desquamation of pneumocytes into alveolar spaces. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been detected in pneumocytes, 4,9 -13 macrophages, 10 -13 and lymphocytes. 12 Clinical and histopathological data have revealed that the lungs are the main target organs of SARS-CoV, and a more detailed understanding of the pathology in pulmonary tissue will most likely provide insight into the pathogenesis of SARS and the role of SARS-CoV in particular. Up to this point, however, there has been no comprehensive description of the cells targeted by SARS-CoV in lung tissues. In some cases, discrepancies have occurred in reporting the pulmonary pathology of this disease. 4, 9, 12, 13 In the present study, in addition to conventional histopathology, we applied a combination of in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and histochemistry (HC) of pulmonary tissues to evaluate the cellular distribution of the virus in pneumocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts of the lungs.",

These selected fields showed mainly bronchi or bronchioles and alveoli. Cells positive for one specific IHC marker were counted, and cells showing both positive in situ hybridization and IHC signals (positive double labeling) were also counted. The identity of the cells showing co-localization was confirmed by performing in situ hybridization and IHC separately on consecutive sections as described above. The infection rates of each of the three cell types as identified by IHC were derived from cell counts (cells showing positive double labeling/total number of cells positive for a specific IHC marker). All evaluations were performed in a doubleblinded manner. The infection rate of each of the three cell types was graded according to the following criteria: 1) cell infection rates less than 10% were regarded as grade I and were marked with \u03e9; 2) cell infection rates between 10% and 20% were regarded as grade II and were marked with \u03e9\u03e9; and 3) cell infection rates exceeding 20% were regarded as grade III and were marked with \u03e9\u03e9\u03e9. The infection rates for each specific cell type and the semiquantifications of the infection rates are presented in Tables 4 and 5 . Infection rates of endothelial cells and fibroblasts were not calculated because the absolute numbers of infected endothelial cells were very small and because of the lack of a specific marker for fibroblasts in general.

Furthermore, direct infection and subsequent damage to immune cells may result in a transient compromised immune system that could aggravate the pulmonary injury. 12 SARS-CoV infection of macrophages may play an additional role in the pathogenesis of SARS lungs. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that infection of macrophages induced expression of certain chemokines. 16 In addition, little or no interferon response could be elicited by SARS-CoV infection of macrophages in the same experiments. Both increased levels of chemokines and deficiency of the interferon-\u2424 response may result in exacerbation of the local inflammatory reaction in SARS lungs. 16 We found SARS-CoV in both large and small CD68-positive cells.

In this study, we found that SARS-CoV is capable of infecting vascular endothelial cells.

However, the paucity of infected endothelial cells seems insufficient to explain the severe vascular injury. Previous studies have reported high levels of various cytokines and chemokines in the serum of SARS patients. 17 , 18 We therefore assume that in addition to direct viral infection, both hyperinduction of proinflammatory mediators and hypoxia may play an important role in the injury of vascular endothelium in SARS patients.",

Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV. 20, 21 This receptor is expressed abundantly in tracheal epithelium, pneumocytes, and vascular endothelium but not in lymphocytes, macrophages, or fibroblasts. 22 It is thus possible that SARS-CoV infects epithelial cells of the trachea, pneumocytes, and vascular endothelial cells (all expressing ACE2), through interaction of the spike protein and ACE2, and then replicates in these cells to cause intercellular transmission. However, the mechanism by which SARS-CoV infects cells that do not express ACE2 receptors is unclear. In this study, both lymphocytes and macrophages harbored viral genomic sequences and had high infection rates, despite the absence of ACE2 expression. A possible explanation is that ACE2-negative cells, such as macrophages, are infected on contact with the basolateral aspect of infected epithelial cells by direct cell-cell contact or engulfment. In measles, this kind of indirect infection has been described to account for the infection of tissue-resident macrophages and dendritic cells. 23 In addition, other receptors may play a role in direct infection of ACE2-negative cells. Both lymph node-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN), and dendritic-cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) have been reported to function as receptors for SARS-CoV. 24 -26 DC-SIGN expression has been detected in certain types of dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages, 27 which may explain the presence of SARS-CoV genomic sequences in lung tissue macrophages as observed in this study. However, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that cells expressing DC-SIGN or L-SIGN without ACE2 are not or are only partially susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. 24 -26 This suggests that these receptors are much less efficient than ACE2 receptors and merely enhance infection of susceptible cells. 24 -26 All these findings suggest that other receptors and/or cofactors may be involved in the interaction between the virus and the target cells.",

Mature endothelial cells express relatively low levels of cathepsin L, 30 which",
