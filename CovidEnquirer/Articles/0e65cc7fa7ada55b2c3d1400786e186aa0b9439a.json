            "text": "Molecular clones of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), derived from the Vero cell adapted Beaudette strain, were constructed, using an in vitro assembly method. In vitro transcribed RNA from a cDNA template that had been constructed from seven cDNA fragments, encompassing the entire genome of IBV, was electroporated into BHK-21 cells. The cells were overlaid onto the susceptible Vero cells and viable virus was recovered from the molecular clone. The molecularly cloned IBV (MIBV) demonstrated growth kinetics, and plaque size and morphology that resembled the parental Beaudette strain IBV. The recombinant virus was further manipulated to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by replacing an open reading frame (ORF) of the group-specific gene, ORF 5a, with the EGFP ORF. The rescued recombinant virus, expressing EGFP (GIBV), replicated to lower viral titers and formed smaller plaques compared to the parental virus and the MIBV. After six passages of GIBV, a minority of plaques were observed that had reverted to the larger plaque size and virus from these plaques no longer expressed EGFP. Direct sequencing of RT-PCR products derived from cells infected with the plaque-purified virus, which had lost expression of EGFP, confirmed loss of the EGFP ORF. The loss of EGFP expression (D5a IBV) was also accompanied by reversion to growth kinetics resembling the standard virus and intact recombinant virus. This study demonstrates that the 5a ORF is not essential for viral multiplication in Vero cells.",

The group II coronaviruses include human coronavirus OC43, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), and bovine coronavirus. IBV belongs to the group III coronaviruses, all of which are avian specific. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) respiratory disease in humans that resembles IBV in poultry may be distantly related to group II coronaviruses (Snijder et al., 2003; Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004) . Coronavirus genomes also encode group-specific ORF that have been reported to express in infected cells (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Liu and Inglis, 1992; Liu et al., 1991) . Functions of these genes are not well understood, however, deletion of combinations of several group-specific genes in MHV resulted in in vivo attenuation (de Haan et al., 2002) . Although the functions of the four IBV group-specific ORF, 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b are not known, a Vero cell passaged IBV mutant with a truncated 3b was viable in vitro and in vivo (Shen et al., 2003) .",

Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) and vaccinia virus vectors, both of which can accommodate the large coronavirus genomes, have been utilized to carry a full-length cDNA clone of the genome (Almazan et al., 2000; Casais et al., 2001; Gonzalez et al., 2002; Thiel et al., 2001) . A third system relied on the in vitro assembly of a modest number of cloned cDNAs. Instead of cloning the entire genome of TGEV into vectors, Yount et al. (2000) amplified the viral genome into several fragments by RT-PCR and the cloned amplicons were ligated through unique restriction sites for in vitro assembly of the entire genome. This strategy was further modified to construct an infectious cDNA clone of MHV with their bno see'mQ technology, in which restriction endonuclease sequences were incorporated into amplicons, such that upon enzyme treatment, the endonuclease sites were eliminated prior to in vitro ligation. The assembled cDNA product was used as template for in vitro transcription to generate genomic RNA (Yount et al., 2002) . More recently, this strategy was used to construct a reverse genetic system for the SARS CoV (Yount et al., 2003) .",

Five RT-PCR fragments were produced that cumulatively amplified the entire genome of the Vero cell adapted Beaudette IBV strain. Amplicons, overlapping by about 10 nucleotides, were designated A through E and the fragment lengths were as follows; A, 2269 nts; B, 6356 nts; C, 6895 nts; D, 5030 nts; and E, 7058 nts (Fig. 1B) . However, consistent with the report that these regions were toxic or unstable in bacteria, difficulties arose in cloning the B and C fragments into bacterial plasmid based cloning vectors (Casais et al., 2001) . Therefore, the B and C fragments were each cloned as two smaller fragments B1 and B2, and C1 and C2. Fragments A through C2 were cloned into the pSMART vector and fragments D through E2 were cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO cloning vectors. In order to determine the consensus sequence of the genome, two to five independent clones of each amplicon were sequenced using a panel of internal primers. Clones with consensus sequences were used for in vitro assembly of full-length cDNA template. There were several sequence differences, distributed throughout the entire genome of IBV, between our standard cell adapted IBV strain and the published Beaudette sequence (Table 1 ). The standard parental strain of IBV Beaudette used for these studies had a five nucleotide insertion at position 25,414 between the M and 5a ORFs, resulting in a genome size of 27,613, instead of 27,608 nt. The sequence differences were confirmed by sequencing three independent clones and direct sequencing of RT-PCR products. A nucleotide insertion was found in an intergenic sequence of our strain compared to the original published sequence. In addition, an E amplicon with a single unique nucleotide change of A to G at position 25,793 nt, resulting in amino acid change from Q to R, was used as a marker for the molecular clone. Full-length cDNA was in vitro assembled with amplicons conforming with our established consensus sequence. To increase full-length in vitro ligation efficiency, ordered ligation reactions were used. The appropriately sized ligation reaction products were purified from 1% agarose gels before further ligating with neighboring inserts (Fig. 1C) .",

Although many recombinant viruses have been constructed to express EGFP or GFP without known reports that EGFP is toxic to virus replication, EGFP was shown in at least one study to induce cellular apoptosis (Liu et al., 1999) . In the current study, it is possible that infected cells died by apoptosis because of high expression of EGFP prior to producing maximum amounts of virus viral replication. This is consistent with the finding that we could detect expression of EGFP before cells showed CPE. Alternatively, manipulation of ORF 5a could affect ORF 5b expression. It has been assumed that gene 5b is expressed by leaky scanning mechanism (Liu and Inglis, 1992) . The EGFP ORF contained an appropriate Kozak sequence and may have reduced the expression of 5b.

Based on sequence analysis, four distinct deletion events were indicated. It has been shown that the GFP gene has homology with the MHV TRS and hinders expression of GFP because of abortive transcription (Fischer et al., 1997) . However, we do not favor this explanation because, contrary to Fisher et al., we had sufficient expression of EGFP, with recombinant virus during the first several passages, to be easily detectable and no sequence similarity could be identified in or around the deleted region between the IBV TRS and the EGFP gene. Non-homologous recombination events during IBV Fig. 6 . EGFP deletion revertant of GIBV showed comparable plaques to standard IBV or MIBV. After six serial passages of GIBV, heterogeneoussized plaques were observed. The arrow indicates typical GIBV plaques with the smaller size compared to MIBV and the arrow head indicates a larger plaque from the GIBV stock that was comparable to the standard cell adapted IBV, and plaques purified from the larger plaques in A are shown in panel B. replication likely accounts for the deletion of a gene, such as EGFP, that is not necessary for the viral replication. It is not clear whether the foreign gene itself or its specific location in the viral genome causes this spontaneous deletion event. Furthermore, we cannot conclude whether deletion of the EGFP gene, under the control of the 5a TRS, is a general phenomenon of recombinant IBV or a result of EGFP toxicity.",
