The \"Breda\" agent had the morphology of a virus and possessed a hemagglutinin. Antigenic studies showed the virus to be antigenically different from bovine coronavirus, parainfluenza 3 virus, bovine rotavirus, bovine parvovirus and bovine pestivirus (BVD). Attempts to culture the virus in cell or organ cultures or in embryonated eggs, were unsuccessful. The virus was either spherical or kidney shaped, with 7--9 nm peplomers on the surface. A few particles possessed coronavirus processes of 17--20 nm, but these were arranged irregularly and were thought to be tissue debris. Three out of eight experimental calves developed severe diarrhea and the lesions in the small and large intestines were similar to those reported for coronavirus. The virus replicated in the jejunal and ileal regions of the small intestine and in the spiral colon, as judged by immunofiuorescence. The virus multiplied in all experimental calves and was excreted in the feces; excretion correlating with the onset of diarrhea or a change in the appearance of the feces. There was little or no malabsorption measured by the uptake of D-xylose and the fact that infection of both the crypt and villus epithelial cells was observed, suggests that the pathogenesis may be different from rotavirus and coronavirus. Fourteen of fortyseven calves in the outbreak were infected with the virus, virus was not identified in other farm outbreaks of the disease.",

Rotaviruses have been isolated from diarrhea occurring in all animals studied, including human beings, and their pathogenesis determined experimentally in calves, pigs and mice (Mebus et al., 1971; Woode et al. 1974 reviewed by McNulty, 1978 and Flewett and . Coronaviruses commonly cause diarrhea in calves (Mebus et al. 1973; Bridger et al., 1978) . Although rotavirus and coronavirus are the 0378-1135/82/0000--0000/$02.75 \u00a9 1982 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company viruses most frequently associated with diarrhea in young calves, recently the presence of calicivirus-like agents and astroviruses , and parvoviruses (Storz and Bates, 1973} , have become recognized. Many outbreaks Of the dise~e are associated with a combination of different viruses and pathogenic bacteria, and as an example of this it has been possible to identify from one calf with diarrhea at two days of age: Salmonella dublin, coronavirus, astrovirus, and three antigenically different calicivirus-like agents; most, if not all of these agents are known to be pathogenic (Woode and Bridget, 1978; Bridger and Hall, 1979) . This finding is not surprising if one accepts the hypothesis that the fecal-oral route is the main method of spread of the agents. Thus the disease is complex and a continual search is being made worldwide for new viral pathogens causing scouring in animals. As a result of these studies, a new coronavirus pathogen has been identified recently in the pig (Pensaert and De Bouck, 1978) .",

            "text": "A beef herd in Iowa had experienced severe neonatal calf diarrhea for at least three years, in which the mortality rate was high during excessively cold weather. No etiological agent had been associated with the majority of affected calves, although an occasional isolation was made of rotavirus or coronavirus. During the period from 25 March--1 May, 1979, a detailed investigation was made in an attempt to identify the presence of a viral agent. Of the first 69 calves born, 39 developed diarrhea and 6 died. The remaining 30 calves remained normal. Diarrhea commenced at any age from 2--20 days, but usually at 3--5 days. The clinical syndrome was usually severe and similar to that seen with rotavirus or coronavirus infections. There was yellow to white semisolid or watery diarrhea, profuse in quantity, rapidly leading to severe dehydration. The first 69 calves born were all housed immediately after birth and 66 placed in direct or indirect contact with other scouring calves, as diarrhea commenced with the third calf born. This practice was thought to have contributed to the rapid spread of infection and development of disease at an early age. However, from 13 April the calves were born and reared at pasture, but this practice did not eliminate the disease. From 13--19 April, 12/30 calves born developed diarrhea and three died after 3--5 days duration of diarrhea. Between 22 April and 1 May, 29 calves were born, all of which remained clinically normal. Diarrheic samples were studied by electron microscopy for the presence of viruses. One preparation (B276) had a large number of viral-like particles which were described as atypical coronavirus. This agent was shown to be different from coronavirus by serological tests, and further studies were made in order to characterize the agent as a virus, which was named \"Breda\" agent after the town in Iowa from which area it was isolated.",

Gnotobiotic calves (GC) were produced and maintained using a method described recently, modified by an open caesarean method (Matthews et al., 1981) . Following caesarean section under deep general anesthesia, the calves were exposed briefly to the air of the operating theater, while being passed through a germicidal trap containing 10% Wescodyne (Wests Chemical Pro-duction}. The calves were inoculated orally with 5 ml of the 0.45 ~m filtrate at 0--8 days of age. Colostrum-deprived (CD) new born calves were placed in isolation and inoculated as above. Two calves (CF) were fed colostrum, one 8 h before (CF 2) and one 7 h after (CF 1) virus inoculation. Fecal samples and the body temperature were collected and recorded respectively twice daily. For pathological studies, the calves were killed either at the first sign of diarrhea or 24 h later (Calves CD 1, CD 2, and GC 1).",

Although all early attempts to culture the agent in vitro were unsuccessful, from precedents established with other enteritis inducing viruses, we assumed that the natural host would be the most sensitive system for demonstrating infectivity (Woode, 1979}. The \"Breda\" agent was shown to be infectious in both gnotobiotic and conventionally derived calves as all the experimental calves inoculated orally excreted the agent for 3--4 days in the feces and one serial passage of the agent through two calves was successful. The agent can be tentatively classified as a virus on the bais of its infectious nature in calves, the size, shape, presence of the hemagglutinin and the specific immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm of infected epithelial cells.",

The immunofluorescent data of the small intestine and colon, and the pathology of the colon, shows a greater similarity with coronavirus infection rather than with rotavirus. Only with lamb rotavirus has infection of the colon been demonstrated {Snodgrass et al., 1977) . The watery nature of the diarrhea which is commonly observed with gnotobiotic calves infected with coronavirus and with calf GC 1 in this study, is probably due to the colonic lesion and consequently, reduction in the ability to absorb water. However, the immunofluorescent studies suggest that the pathogenesis may differ from coronavirus in that most immunofluorescent cells were observed in the lower 50% of the small intestinal villus and throughout the crypt region, and in the colon throughout the length of the villus and crypt. This would imply that the primary site of infection is in the crypt cells and infected cells migrate up the villus before being shed as the viral cytopathic effect develops.",

These include bovine coronavirus (as characterized by Sharpee et al., 1976) , parvovirus, and rotavirus, parainfluenza 3 virus in this study, and reovirus 3 (Woode, unpublished data) . In addition, bovine pestivirus (BVD) could not be isolated from preparations containing the \"Breda\" virus, and antiserum to the \"Breda\" virus did not possess antibodies to BVD. The HI test for studying sera for the presence of antibody was considered to be unreliable and thus serological data suggestive of widespread distribution of the agent on farms should be treated with reservation. The virus may be common in the U.S. as a similar agent has been observed in one calf in South Dakota and in calves in Ohio. and antiserum to the \"Breda\" virus reacts specifically with the Ohio isolate (Saif, personal communication, 1981) , however, it appears that these two latter viruses are different serotypes.",

An inner layer of short peplomers (10 nm) is seen on some particles. In contrast, the \"Breda\" agent is more pleomorphic with at least two distinct shapes: ovoid (89 X 75 nm) and sausage or kidney shaped (120 X 32 nm). The majority of particles possess peplomers (7.6--9.5 nm). Like coronaviruses, the \"Breda\" virus frequently shows an electron-dense region. This appeared to represent the cleft region seen in the kidney particles and may be similar to the internal component reported in avian infectious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus (Bingham and Almeida, 1977) . In the authors' experience, the short peplomers are not visible on bovine coronavirus particles, when they lack the 17--24 nm peplomers. The short peplomers seen on the \"Breda\" agent are similar to those of many enveloped viruses from a variety of families (Dalton and Haguenau, 1973) .",
