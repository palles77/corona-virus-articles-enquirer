The next most common viruses in connection to bronchiolitis are human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus followed by parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and influenza virus ( Figure 1 ). Virus coinfections, mostly with RSV and RV, occur in 10%-40% of the severe cases, but reports on their clinical significancy are inconclusive. 9, 10 Respiratory syncytial virus belonging to the Pneumovirus genus in the Paramyxoviridae family is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus with two antigenically different A and B subtypes with 11 and 23 genotypes, respectively. 11 Although severe reinfections have been reported in young children, they are generally mild. 12 Main risk factors for RSV bronchiolitis include prematurity, chronic lung disease (low lung function), congenital heart disease, other underlying medical conditions, and young age (1-6 months of age), that is, conditions in which excessive mucus in the airways is problematic, as well as deficient interferon responses. 2 Rhinovirus belonging to the Enterovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family is a nonenveloped single-stranded RNA virus, and it comprises a genetically diverse group of viruses. It has three distinct subgroups, A, B, and C, which consist of 83, 32, and 55 genotypes,",

Recent studies have suggested that certain microbial colonization patterns prevalent already in early childhood may affect the risk of bronchiolitis and precede the development of persistent wheeze or asthma. 35 Furthermore, the severity of the acute respiratory infections may be modulated by the type of microbial community in the airways independent of RSV or RV coinfection, while at the same time, both RSV and RV may increase the severity of the infection independent of the bacteria. 34 It has also been shown that antibiotic treatment during acute wheezing episodes in childhood greatly decreases the duration of the symptoms, thus pointing toward microbial effects. 36 Likewise, a study of 1005 infants demonstrated that certain airway microbiota profiles seemed to increase the severity of bronchiolitis. 37 The rate of intensive care use and the length of hospital stay during the episode of acute bronchiolitis were particularly high in infants with a Haemophilus-dominant profile but low in infants with a Moraxella-dominant profile. This, although low in statistical power, was especially apparent in children with RSV bronchiolitis but not found for RV bronchiolitis. In a small randomized trial of 40 children hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis, treatment with azithromycin during the acute episode seemed to alleviate the subsequent risk of long-term respiratory morbidity. 38 The microbiome of the human gut is shaped by an extensive Interactions between the two in bronchiolitis episodes may determine the severity various common as well as distinct unique pathogenic mechanisms.",

[44] [45] [46] [47] While severe RSV bronchiolitis is associated with weaker antiviral innate interferon responses, data on the association between virus genome load and illness severity are discrepant. 47, 48 Furthermore, ineffective inflammatory and adaptive immune responses are important factors that contribute to severe RSV disease. As at birth the immune system is still immature and needs to develop, it depends mostly on the innate immune system in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) ligation and maternal-derived antibodies. At the same time, pro-inflammatory innate immune responses are not very prominent as anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, prevail since during pregnancy mother's immune system protects the fetus. 49 As a consequence, T helper 1 (Th1) cell skewing cytokines such as IL-12 seem to develop rather slowly in young infants, even in the presence of TLR-ligating viruses and increased type I interferon production. 50, 51 Interestingly, the cytokines IL-6 and IL-23, both potent inducers of IL-17-producing T cells, were found to be increased in TLR-stimulated neonatal cells and neonates were shown to have increased numbers of Th 17 cells ( Figure 4A ). 52 As enhanced pathology following RSV infections is often associated with increased IL-17 production and this cytokine is more prominent in neonates, the presence of this cytokine may contribute to a more severe disease state. 53, 54 In addition, studies in neonatal mice have shown that there is a spontaneous early wave of innate cytokines such as IL-33, a Th 2 skewing cytokine, and a recruitment of innate lymphoid cells (ILC)-2 into the lungs that reach the maximum at day 14 after birth. 55, 56 Therefore, age-specific events in neonatal lungs seem to naturally support the initial development of Th 2 immune responses that combined with a yet ineffective activation of innate immunity and IL-17 being upregulated in young infants, drive mucus hyperproduction and the promotion of severe pathology during early RSV infections. 57 In addition, B-cell function is not yet developed in very young infants (<6 months of age) and it takes more time to generate a sufficient and sustained antibody production. As at very early phase, babies still rely on maternal antibodies, babies born from a mother with high circulating neutralizing antibodies are better protected from severe diseases. 58 This notion has led to the idea of developing a vaccine for RSV that targets pregnant mothers instead of young children. Thus, through vaccinating the mothers, the children would be provided with an increased transfer of protective maternal antibodies against RSV. 59,60",

In addition, RV infections of airway epithelial cells are strong inducers of type 2 innate cytokines, such as IL-25 and IL-33, which subsequently initiate or boost type 2 immunity in the lungs via IL-5-and IL-13-producing innate lymphoid cells (ILC) 2 and Th 2 cells ( Figure 4B) . Surprisingly, the induction of innate cytokines by RV infections was stronger in airway epithelial cells from asthmatics compared to healthy controls. 65 Also, the induction of type 2 innate cytokines may be more pronounced during early childhood, as compared to adult mice, human rhinovirus infections in neonatal mice showed more pronounced IL-13 and IL-25 expression, mucus secretion, and airway hyperresponsiveness. 66 This process may be further boosted or coinciding by an early spontaneous wave of IL-33-dependent type 2 cytokines and cells in developing lungs of neonatal mice. 55, 56 Overall, although RV infections are linked to the induction of milder epithelial inflammation than RSV infections, they tend to reduce type I IFN expression and cause inflammation with Th 2 cell characteristics, disrupted tight junction expression, and high cytokine levels that promote bronchospasm, edema, and mucus production and lead to airway obstruction and wheeze. 1 supportive treatment, that is, oxygen, nasal suctioning, mechanical ventilation, and hydration. 67 High flow oxygen therapy using nasal cannula has shown promising results. 68 There is conflicting information across clinical guidelines about the role of nebulized hypertonic saline in acute management of bronchiolitis. Only a few current guidelines recommend bronchodilators. 2 Overall, corticosteroids (see details below), nebulized epinephrine, or antibiotics are not recommended. 2 Because of the current frustration with the existing treatment modalities (high use of bronchodilators, antibiotics, and corticosteroids) and as the majority of the previous trials have not been based on virus-specific data, is further research required in order to direct focus to more personalized management plans in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. 69 ",

High-risk (parental atopy or asthma) birth cohort studies from Wisconsin, United States, and Australia have shown that young children suffering from RV-induced wheezing episodes are at high risk of school-age asthma (odds ratio up to, RV vs RSV, 9.8 vs 2.6). [85] [86] [87] The risk is especially high if children were sensitizated at an age younger than 2 years. 85, 87 A recent study on hospitalized children shows similar results: RV-induced severe first wheezing episode at an age less than 2 years was a risk factor (odds ratio 5.0) for atopic asthma at school-age along with early sensitization and eczema (odds ratios 12 and 4.8, respectively) while RSV was associated with neither atopic nor nonatopic asthma. 7 Therefore, data from these high-risk birth cohorts suggest that atopic airways have an increased susceptibility for asthma development after RV-induced bronchiolitis.",

For the treatment of RSV-induced bronchiolitis, there is a prophylactic RSV-specific monoclonal antibody available that decreases the risk of recurrent wheezing. 2) RV-induced wheezing is associated with atopic predisposition and high risk of asthma, which may be reversed with systemic corticosteroid in patients with severe first episode. RV susceptibility, thus, serves as an important early marker for asthma-prone children. 3) Wheeze due to other viruses is likely to be less frequent and severe. Clinically, it is important to distinguish between these three partially overlapping patient groups, as they are likely to respond to different treatments. The first severe episode of bronchiolitis or wheezing in a less than 2-year-old child appears to be a critical event and an important opportunity for designing secondary prevention strategies for asthma. Thus, bronchiolitis cannot simply be diagnosed using a certain cutoff age, but instead, viral etiology should be used as the differentiating factor. For nomenclature, we suggest that there are an RSV-induced bronchiolitis and an RV-induced first wheezing episode to better distinguish these conditions.",
