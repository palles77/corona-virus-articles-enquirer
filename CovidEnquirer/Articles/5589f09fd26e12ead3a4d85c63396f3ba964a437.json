Such patients exhibit great diversity in conditions necessitating care in the ICU, age, underlying medical problems, and integrity of physiologic compensatory mechanisms. All these patients, however, share the need for optimized oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue perfusion. Ongoing blood loss resulting from injuries, surgical wounds, invasive monitoring equipment, and blood sampling requirements, coupled with inadequate marrow function and, in some, red cell destruction, makes red cell transfusion a necessity for many ICU patients. Additionally, many patients are susceptible to the development of hemostatic disorders requiring the administration of such blood components as plasma, cryoprecipitate, or platelet concentrates.",

The process of donor selection and screening has become increasingly stringent, an evolution that began in response to the welldefi ned risks of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis and human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) infection. Although the value of maximizing recipient safety is unarguable, increasing donor selectivity has its price. As more tests are added and more conditions placed on the donor, the number of usable donations has declined. This trend has led to occasional regional and seasonal blood shortages and, rarely, outright inability to provide certain blood components.

Transfusion of blood components containing leukocytes may lead to febrile reactions, a greater propensity for alloimmunization, platelet alloimmunization, and transmission of pathogens carried by leukocytes, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV). Leukocyte reduction, as defi ned by the FDA, requires fi ltration of the blood component by a special fi lter. 1 Filtration may be performed either at the time of blood donation and processing or later at the time of transfusion (\"bedside fi ltration\"). Filtration before storage conveys the benefi t of removing white blood cells (WBCs) before they can deteriorate and elaborate cytokines and other unwanted substances during storage. 8 Because of proven and theoretical benefi ts of leukocyte reduction of blood components (discussed later in the section covering the adverse effects of transfusion), many European countries and Canada require that all transfusions be leukocyte reduced, a process called universal leukoreduction (ULR). Some institutions in the United States have also made that decision, but either method of leukocyte reduction adds signifi cantly to the cost of each transfusion ($25 to $30), and the benefi ts of this measure when applied globally have yet to be quantifi ed. 9 Washing PRBCs involves recentrifuging to remove the plasma/preservative solution from the unit. However, washing may take an hour or more, limits subsequent storage time, and causes some loss of RBCs. Washing is also not an effective method of leukoreduction. There are very few indications for the use of washed RBCs, although some recipients with plasma reactions may benefi t. PRBCs can be frozen in cryoprotective solution and stored for extended periods. Frozen RBCs are generally limited to units of special value, such as those with a rare RBC antigen profi le or autologous blood donations that need to be stored for future use. A rare-donor registry of frozen PRBCs exists to assist in providing blood to patients with complex or multiple alloantibodies to red cell antigens. Signifi cant advanced planning is necessary to acquire and thaw frozen PRBCs for transfusion, thus limiting their use in acute situations.",

Over time in storage, a slow rise in the concentration of potassium, lactate, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, ammonia, phosphate, and free hemoglobin and a slow decrease in pH and bicarbonate concentration occur.

            "text": "Despite a long tradition of transfusion of RBCs in critically ill patients, the precise indications for transfusion remain a source of controversy, and specifi c transfusion practices may vary widely among clinicians. Before the major randomized studies of RBC transfusion policies, a survey of transfusion practice showed that about half of ICU patients were receiving red cell transfusions, 13 and another showed that if the ICU stay was longer than a week, the rate of transfusion was 85%. 14 The total number of transfusions was high, and ICU practice was characterized by high rates of transfusion. 15 The reasons for the controversies are clear: RBCs should be transfused only to enhance tissue oxygen delivery, but the underlying physiology of anemia, the complex adaptations to anemia, and the potential advantages and disadvantages to particular groups of patients are not as well understood. Compensatory mechanisms for acute and chronic anemia are diverse and complex. 16, 17 All work in concert to maintain oxygenation within the microcirculation. Cardiovascular adjustments leading to increased cardiac output include decreased afterload and increased preload resulting from changes in vascular tone, increased myocardial contractility, and elevated heart rate. Lowered blood viscosity permits improved fl ow of erythrocytes within capillaries. Blood fl ow is redistributed to favor critical organs with higher oxygen extraction. Pulmonary mechanisms, though contributing relatively little to shortterm oxygenation demands, exert potent effects on related metabolic variables. Finally, the hemoglobin molecule can undergo biochemical and conformational changes to enhance unloading of oxygen at the capillary level. All these mechanisms contribute to an \"oxygen reserve\" capacity that exceeds baseline requirements by approximately fourfold. 16 No experimental model exists that encompasses the diversity of physiologic compensations for hypoxia. Experiments carried out in animals and case reports in patients refusing transfusion indicate that an extremely low Hct is tolerated if tissue perfusion is adequate. [18] [19] [20] Certain objective, though indirect, measurements of tissue oxygenation exist and are available to clinicians caring for patients monitored invasively in the ICU. Mixed venous oxygen content (Pv O 2 ) and cardiac output can be measured in patients undergoing pulmonary artery catheterization; arterial oxygen content can also be measured directly. The oxygen extraction ratio (ER) can be calculated directly, and in the presence of normal or high cardiac output it is a measure of tissue oxygen extraction and, indirectly, the adequacy of tissue oxygen delivery. The total body ER at baseline is about 25%. A falling Pv O 2 and an ER increasing to greater than 50% have been proposed as indicators of the need for red cell transfusion. 21 There have been only 10 randomized trials of transfusion policy in the ICU, and only 1 of them was large enough to draw specifi c, statistically signifi cant conclusions. 22 The Canadian Critical Care Trials Group compared a liberal (target hemoglobin, 10 to 12 g/dL) with a restrictive (target hemoglobin, 7 to 9 g/dL) red cell transfusion policy in patients stratifi ed for disease severity. At 30 days from randomization, the restrictive strategy was at least as good as, if not better than (P = .11) the liberal strategy, and overall hospital mortality was signifi cantly lower in the restrictive strategy group (P = .05). For patients younger than 55 years and for patients with lower (<20) APACHE (Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation) II scores, the restrictive strategy was clearly superior. In addition, liberal transfusion was not associated with shorter ICU stays, less organ failure, or shorter hospital stays; longer mechanical ventilation times and cardiac events were more frequent in the liberal strategy group. A later subgroup analysis of patients with cardiovascular disease, though small enough to have statistical doubt, suggested that a more liberal transfusion strategy was probably appropriate for patients with severe ischemic coronary disease. 23 This observation has some support in experimental studies of the effects of anemia in laboratory animals with coronary occlusion. 24 The Canadian study has highlighted the many and complex issues involved in transfusion decision making in the ICU.",

Vincent and colleagues 25 surveyed European ICUs and found that the transfusion rate in 3534 patients was 37% during the ICU stay and 12.7% after the stay. The mean pretransfusion hemoglobin level was 8.4 g/ dL. Corwin and colleagues 26 studied 284 ICUs in the United States a year later and found great similarity: nearly 50% of patients received transfusions, and the mean threshold hemoglobin level was 8.6 g/dL. A single large Scottish teaching hospital reported a more parsimonious practice: the rate of transfusion was still 52% in its ICU patients, but the total volume of blood used was slightly smaller and the mean pretransfusion hemoglobin level was only 7.8 g/dL. 27 All these authors have concluded that ICU practice has not fully embraced the guidelines of the Canadian clinical trial. In contrast, 18 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand have reported on transfusion in 1808 consecutive ICU admissions, and although the authors found a median pretransfusion hemoglobin concentration of 8.2 g/dL, the rate of transfusion was lower, at only 19.7% of patients, 60% of whom were bleeding. 28 The \"inappropriate\" transfusion rate was 3%. The authors speculate that the practitioners may have been infl uenced by publication of the Canadian study and their own regional survey of transfusion practices. Nonetheless, they agree that full implementation of the Canadian guidelines in their clinical setting might be controversial.",

The bleeding time is not a useful procedure in this situation because it is usually prolonged at counts below 80 \u00d7 10 9 /L, may be insuffi ciently reproducible, and correlates poorly with the risk for bleeding. 37 Patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery experience a drop in platelet count and often acquire a transient platelet functional defect from damage associated with the bypass apparatus. 38 Most patients do not experience platelet-associated bleeding, however, so prophylactic transfusion in the absence of bleeding is not warranted.

            "text": "Prophylactic platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia secondary to underproduction remains controversial. The common practice of transfusion to maintain the platelet count above 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L derives from data published in 1962, which demonstrated an increase in spontaneous bleeding in leukemic patients at that level. 42 However, critical evaluation of the data reveals that serious hemorrhage was not greatly increased until counts fell to 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L or lower and that these patients received aspirin for fever, which might have compromised platelet function and enhanced the bleeding. A somewhat more recent study quantitating stool blood loss in aplastic anemia patients defi ned a bleeding threshold at platelet counts of 5 to 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L. 43 A prospective study of a more conservative transfusion protocol found that major bleeding episodes occurred on 1.9% of days with counts of less than 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L and on only 0.07% of days with counts of 10 to 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L. 44 The trigger for prophylactic platelet transfusion in the 5 to 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L range, however, applies primarily to stable thrombocytopenic patients. Factors such as fever, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs, and invasive procedures must be considered when generating a treatment plan for individual patients. Patients experiencing rapid drops in platelet count may be at greater risk than those at steady state and thus may benefi t from transfusion at higher counts. Benefi ts to the patient with more judicious use of platelet transfusion include decreased donor exposure, which lessens the risk of transfusion-transmitted disease; fewer febrile and allergic reactions that may complicate the hospital course; and the potential delay or prevention of alloimmunization to HLA and platelet antigens. 45 The development of refractoriness to platelet transfusions is a serious event heralded by a falling CCI. Poor response to platelet transfusions can be seen in patients with other reasons for platelet consumption, including splenomegaly, fever, trauma and crush injury, burns, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), concomitant drugs, or transfusion of platelets of substandard quality. 46 These factors should be sought and corrected if possible. Alloimmunization is characterized by the development of anti-HLA or platelet-specifi c antibodies, with resultant immune platelet destruction. As many as 70% of patients receiving multiple red cell or platelet transfusions become immunized. 45 Leukocyte depletion of transfused components can prevent or delay this phenomenon, but it is important to use leukoreduced components early in the course of transfusion therapy. 45, 47 When patients fail to achieve expected increments after platelet transfusion, provision of ABO-specifi c platelet concentrates that are less than 48 hours old may improve the response. If no improvement is seen and the aforementioned medical conditions are excluded, the patient should be screened for HLA antibodies or be HLA typed and provided with HLA-compatible single-donor platelets. Alternatively, platelet crossmatching with the patient's serum can be carried out. There is no advantage to unmatched singledonor platelets in this situation.",

The usual volume is about 250 mL, depending on the donor's Hct. The most common method of thawing before transfusion is soaking in a 37\u00b0 C water bath, which requires about 30 to 45 minutes. Once thawed, FFP can be stored refrigerated for a maximum of 24 hours. When prepared and stored in this manner, FFP supplies all the constituents in the amounts normally present in circulating plasma, including stable and labile coagulation factors, complement, albumin, and globulins. By convention, the coagulation factors are present in concentrations of 1 U/mL. Crossmatching to the recipient is not performed, but FFP must be ABO compatible.",

            "text": "Standard FFP is as likely to transmit hepatitis, HIV, and most other transfusion-related infections as cellular components are. New FFP products have recently been introduced in response to concern about the transmission of infectious diseases. One such product is solventdetergent-treated FFP. 48 Solvent-detergent treatment is a means of viral inactivation that removes the infectivity of lipid-enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis B and C and HIV. Because the product is derived from pooled plasma, with as many as 2500 donors in each lot, it has the potential to actually increase recipient exposure to pathogens not inactivated by the solvent-detergent method, such as hepatitis A and parvovirus B19, and be more vulnerable to any newly emerging non-lipid-enveloped agent. A variety of other techniques for reducing pathogen exposure in FFP have been developed, including exposure to low pH or vapor heating and treatment with ultraviolet irradiation, gamma irradiation, or psoralens and light to inactivate pathogens by inducing DNA damage. 49 Because none of the FFP products is entirely free from the risk of disease transmission or other adverse effects and because infection-reducing modifi cations add significantly to the cost of the components, FFP should be used judiciously. 50 It should be administered only to provide coagulation factors or plasma proteins that cannot be obtained from safer sources. FFP is commonly used to treat bleeding patients with acquired defi ciency of multiple coagulation factors, as in liver disease, DIC, or dilutional coagulopathy, or to treat patients with congenital defi ciency of a coagulation factor or other protein for which concentrates or safer sources do not exist. FFP may be indicated for emergency reversal of the coagulopathy induced by warfarin anticoagulants when more concentrated products are not available or for the provision of protein C or S in patients who are defi cient and suffering acute thrombosis. FFP should be administered as boluses as rapidly as feasible so that the resulting factor levels allow hemostasis. The use of FFP infusions without adequate bolus administration is not helpful. FFP should not be used for volume expansion or wound healing or as a nutritional source of protein. FFP does not reverse anticoagulation induced by heparin and in theory might exacerbate bleeding by supplying more antithrombin, heparin's cofactor.",

Most of these procedures may be carried out safely without transfusing FFP. 53, 55 FFP is probably the most misused blood component, as illustrated by retrospective surveys. 56 Coagulation factors are normally present in the blood far in excess of the minimum levels required for hemostasis. As little as 10% of the normal plasma concentration of several factors will effect hemostasis. Conversely, FFP treatment of acquired multiple defi ciencies, as in hepatic failure, is often ineffective because many patients cannot tolerate the infusion volumes required to achieve hemostatic levels of coagulation factors, even transiently. 57 The plasma half-life of transfused factor VII is only 2 to 6 hours. It may be impossible to administer suffi cient FFP every few hours without encountering intravascular volume overload. Finally, in some instances, transfusion of seemingly adequate volumes may still fail to correct the coagulopathy. 58 Careful documentation of both the need for FFP and the adequacy and outcomes of therapy is essential. 59",

Although RhIG is used primarily in obstetrics, it may also be indicated to prevent alloimmunization in Rh-negative patients receiving small amounts of Rh-positive red cells, as in platelet concentrates. Routine prophylaxis against large numbers of red cells, as in a unit of Rh-positive WB or PRBCs given by accident to an Rh-negative recipient, is not reliable and usually involves the administration of large amounts, but instances of its effective use in these circumstances have been reported.

Clinical signs include fever, with or without chills, usually beginning 1 to 2 hours after the start of the transfusion but occasionally delayed up to 4 to 6 hours. Multiparous women and patients who are multiply transfused are particularly prone to FNHRs. The transfusion must be stopped and the appropriate transfusion reaction evaluation instituted. Antipyretics such as acetaminophen may be administered. Though commonly used, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine are neither preventive nor therapeutic. Once acute hemolysis is excluded, transfusion of a new unit may be instituted. Most patients will not experience a second such reaction. 73 If repeated reactions become problematic, leukocyte-depleted blood components may be supplied.

Similar reactions have been called pulmonary leukoagglutinin reaction or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. These reactions consist of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops 1 to 6 hours after transfusion. Signs and symptoms include bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates, hypoxemia, fever, and occasionally hypotension. Monitored patients are found to have normal or low pulmonary wedge pressure and central venous pressure, as contrasted with patients experiencing volume overload. If adequate respiratory support and oxygenation are established promptly, spontaneous resolution generally occurs within 1 to 4 days. Deaths have nonetheless occurred, particularly with a delay in diagnosis. 77, 78 Episodes of TRALI appear to have several possible causative mechanisms. Some cases may be caused by donor antibodies reacting with recipient neutrophil or HLA antigens. 79 Plasma factors related to blood storage have also been implicated, such as lipid substances from deterioration of donor cell membranes that prime recipient neu-trophils, which then damage the pulmonary vasculature and lead to increased capillary permeability and an ARDSlike syndrome. 80 Other clinical factors may contribute to increased risk, such as cardiac bypass surgery or other procedures. In the antibody model at least, the implicated antibody is unique to the donor and the affl icted recipient will probably not experience another such reaction, provided that the recipient is not exposed to the same donor.

Difficulties in analysis of human data arise because patients requiring blood transfusions have conditions that themselves induce immune changes. There is some evidence, bolstered by the results of two large clinical trials, to suggest that leukocyte reduction of blood components reduces or eliminates this immunosuppressive effect. 90 Proponents of this viewpoint argue that for this reason, ULR would benefi t most patients receiving blood transfusions and lead to fewer infections, tumor recurrences, and other related putative risks of transfusion, all potentially resulting in saving lives and cost.

Although PTH continues to be a signifi cant cause of morbidity and mortality, the nature of PTH has changed through the years with the stepwise institution of various donor screening measures. The elimination of paid donors in 1972 and the successive introduction of immunologic tests for hepatitis B have resulted in a steady reduction in the rates of PTH caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) to approximately 17 per million units of transfused blood products. Although about 30% to 40% of HBV transmissions will result in acute hepatitis, chronic HBV infection develops in less than 10% of such patients. In contrast, the risk for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after transfusion is higher, nearly 50%, and the long-term risk for cirrhosis-or hepatocellular carcinoma-related mortality is about 15% over more than 20 years after PTH secondary to HCV. 97, 98 The clinical course of hepatitis A is generally milder, and the lack of a chronic carrier state means that with donor screening for symptoms of the acute illness, the risk of transmission is much lower, estimated at less than one in a million units. 99 The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigenemia among fi rst-time blood donors is 0.7%, and the prevalence of hepatitis C antibodies in donors is approximately 0.1% to 0.5%. At this time, given the sensitivity of current screening assays, including the latest generation of enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and NAT, the current risk of PTH resulting from HCV is believed to be about 1 in 150,000 or less. 100 Although HBV is still implicated in PTH (attributable to the seronegative \"window\" period in newly infected donors), the risk of transfusion-associated hepatitis B is about 1 in 200,000 units. 100",

This new agent was created for the treatment of hemophiliac patients with high titers of antibodies to factor VIII, which makes them unable to benefi t from transfusion of recombinant factor VIII. Activated factor VII bypasses that problem by binding to tissue factor and directly activating thrombin and hence generating fi brin. 117 It is extremely expensive, has a short half-life, and carries a risk of inducing pathologic thrombosis, with potentially grave consequences. Nevertheless, in numerous case reports, this new agent appears to potentially be benefi cial if used early in the resuscitation of massively injured patients. Unfortunately, its unsupervised use has also resulted in thrombotic complications and relative lack of success, both of which suggest that carefully controlled clinical trials are appropriate. 118 Blood preservative solutions contain excess citrate, which anticoagulates stored blood by binding ionized calcium. WB contains approximately 1.8 g of citrate/citric acid per unit in the plasma fraction. Patients with normal liver function can metabolize the citrate load in 1 unit of WB in 5 minutes, but hepatic impairment may extend removal to 15 minutes or longer. Toxicity may result when citrate is administered in excess of the metabolic rate, thereby causing a decrease in ionized calcium levels. 119 Although paresthesias, cramps, and myoclonus accompany citrate excess, the chief danger of hypocalcemia is depression of myocardial contractility and potential prolongation of the QT interval. Because the effects of citrate are transient and the use of PRBCs containing little residual citrated plasma is far more common than massive transfusion with WB, routine administration of calcium is not indicated; clinically signifi cant rebound hypercalcemia may result. Calcium infusion should be limited to hypoperfused patients with hepatic or cardiac failure who manifest citrate toxicity, and careful monitoring is essential.",

            "text": "Whether massive transfusion in and of itself is a cause of ARDS is another source of controversy. There are certainly theoretical reasons why massive transfusion might precipitate ARDS: all cellular transfusions contain damaged or activated WBCs, cell membranes, aggregated platelets, and microthrombi, all of which are capable of lodging in and damaging pulmonary capillaries. Despite this possibility, neither microfi ltration of transfusions nor routine leukocyte depletion has shown a signifi cant impact on the incidence of ARDS in massively transfused patients. 123 Certainly, other causes of ARDS exist in patients who undergo massive transfusion, and the possibility of volume overload and TRALI should be considered in the evaluation of patients with hypoxia and diffuse pulmonary infi ltrates after massive transfusion. Management of such patients is supportive, consistent with the overall management of massive transfusion. 124, 125 Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) have an autoantibody, usually of broad specifi city, that fi xes itself to their RBCs and triggers extravascular immune-mediated destruction. Patients with AIHA have a positive direct antiglobulin test 126 (DAT, commonly known as the Coombs test) and varying degrees of he molysis, and their autoantibodies cause agglutination of RBCs from all donors during crossmatching. If the hemolysis is brisk, patients may require red cell transfusion to support oxygen needs before medical management of the AIHA is effective. Hence, transfusion is diffi cult because agglutination during crossmatching interferes with proper defi nition of compatible units of RBCs and because the transfused RBCs are themselves subject to the same immune hemolysis as the host RBCs. Many blood banks have methods for depletion of autoantibodies from the recipient's plasma and elution of antibodies from RBCs to arrive at a proper crossmatch. 127 Although such crossmatches are time consuming and not generally available on an emergency basis, they can be lifesaving. Criteria for transfusion should remain the same as for other recipients.",

Generally, alloimmunization occurs in approximately 1% of transfusions, 68 but the prevalence of alloantibodies is higher in chronically transfused, relatively immunocompetent patients, especially African Americans, whose distribution of red cell antigens has signifi cant variation from the white population. Alloimmunization rates of 30% or higher may be found in chronically transfused patients with hemoglobinopathies who have not received RBCs matched to potent minor antigens such as Kell, Duffy, and Lewis. Alloimmunization may present diffi culties in crossmatching of blood, to the point that compatible blood must be obtained from raredonor registries, if at all. Other patients present unresolved serologic problems in that the alloantibody is never precisely identifi ed yet the majority of blood available for transfusion is incompatible. The delay engendered by working with multiple or unidentifi ed antibodies may be unacceptable in some critical care situations in which the need for oxygen-carrying capacity leaves no choice but to transfuse incompatible blood. The behavior of these antibodies in the laboratory may assist in predicting the clinical outcome of the incompatible transfusion. 128 Special procedures such as clearance studies, 129 fl ow cytometry 130 and in vivo crossmatching (cautious administration of a small aliquot of blood, with subsequent observation of serum and urine for evidence of hemolysis) are useful if time permits.",

The agent to be removed by PE is thought to be an autoantibody in some of the neurologic, renal, or hematologic conditions treated in this manner. 150 Immunomodulation by PE is another explanation for its effect, a theory indirectly supported by the equivalent effi cacy of IVIG therapy for several of these disorders. 151 PE for the amelioration of hyperviscosity from either excess IgM in Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia or excess Ig in multiple myeloma is an effective temporizing measure in the treatment of these conditions. 152 Plasmapheresis with PE is the standard therapy for TTP. 153 Unfortunately, few controlled trials of PE exist, although anecdotal reports abound. PE is seldom the defi nitive treatment of most of these conditions and is used most appropriately as a short-term adjunct to other medical modalities. The kinetics of PE predicts that a one-volume exchange removes 65% of a given plasma constituent if the blood volume does not change or additional synthesis or mobilization of the substance does not occur. Two or three volume exchanges remove 87% and 95%, respectively. Highly protein-bound, intravascularly concentrated substances are most effi ciently removed, whereas substances with a large volume of distribution such as IgG, active synthesis, or large extravascular stores are removed at less than predicted rates. The usual short-term intense course of PE schedules fi ve one-volume exchanges (approximately 3 L in normal-sized adults) over a 7-day period. The appropriate replacement fl uid in most conditions is an albumin-saline mixture, which provides oncotic support without the risk of disease transmission borne by FFP. PE in patients with TTP uses replacement with FFP to supply the plasma protease that is consumed during the disease.",
