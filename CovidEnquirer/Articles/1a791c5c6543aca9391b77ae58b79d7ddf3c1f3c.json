Sia may be present in variant forms that include O-acetyl modifications at C4, C7, C8, and C9 positions, and N-acetyl or N-glycolyl at C5. They can also vary in their linkages, including \u03b12-3 or \u03b12-6-linkages. Here, we analyzed the distribution of modified Sia in cells and tissues of wild-type mice, or in mice lacking cytidine 5'-30 monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) enzyme that synthesizes Nglycolyl modifications (Neu5Gc). We also examined the variation of Sia forms on erythrocytes and saliva from different animals. To determine the effect of Sia modifications on influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we tested for effects on hemagglutinin (HA) binding and neuraminidase (NA) cleavage. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl, 7,9-O-acetyl, 4-O-acetyl, and Neu5Gc 35 modifications are widely but variably expressed in mouse tissues, with the highest levels detected in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Secreted mucins in saliva and surface proteins of erythrocytes showed a great degree of variability in display of modified Sia between different species. IAV HA from different virus strains showed consistently reduced binding to both Neu5Gc and O-acetyl modified Sia; however, while IAV NA were inhibited by Neu5Gc and 40 O-acetyl modifications, there was significant variability between NA types. The modifications of Sia in mucus may therefore have potent effects on the functions of IAV, and may affect both pathogens and the normal flora of different mucosal sites. (241 words) IMPORTANCE 45",

The addition of O-Ac to the C7 and/or C9 positions is mediated by the sialylate O-acetyltransferase enzyme, Cas1 domain containing 1 (CasD1), which has been suggested to add an O-acetyl group to the C7 position, from which it would migrate to the C8 and C9 position under physiological conditions, allowing the possibility 85 of the addition of another O-acetyl group to C7 (7, 13, 14) . The regulatory processes that control the number or positions of acetyl groups have not been well defined, although distinct differences in expression of 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac Sia have been reported in mouse and human tissues, chicken embryos, and in some other animals (7) . CasD1 uses acetyl-CoA to modify Sia in the activated CMP-Sia form before it is added to the glycan chain, and likely has a preference 90 for CMP-Neu5Ac as a substrate and is less active on CMP-Neu5Gc (14). The sialate Oacetylesterase (SIAE) enzyme can remove the 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac modifications, although its activities and roles are not well understood (17) (18) (19) (20) . The 4-O-Ac Sia is produced in some tissues of many animals by a distinct sialate 4-O-acetyltransferase that is also likely expressed in the Golgi compartment; however, the gene for this enzyme has also not yet been identified 95 (21) (22) (23) . The 7, 8 , and/or 9-O-Ac Sia appear to be present at low levels -a few percent or less -in the cell-associated Sia on many cultured cells, but may be present at higher levels (10 to 50%) in Sia on the secreted mucus of various animals and on erythrocyte-associated glycans (15, 24) . However, the expression, distribution, and regulations of these modified Sia are not well 6 pathogens (26, 27) . Many pathogens therefore express proteins that attach to Sia, as well as expressing receptor-modifying enzymes such as sialidases (neuraminidases) that remove the Sia from the underlying glycan. Bacterial adhesins and toxins may recognize Sia on the surface of cells, and many bacteria can also use Sia as a metabolic carbon source after release through 110 the activity of neuraminidases, and uptake into the cell by Sia transporters (3, 28-31). These bacterial interactions with Sia are potentially affected by chemical modifications (30, 32) . Both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses may also bind Sia as primary receptors or co-receptors for cell recognition and infection, although only the enveloped viruses appear to express neuraminidases or sialate O-acetyl esterases, possibly to reduce aggregation of viral particles 115 during budding (5, 33) . For some viruses, Sia modifications are required for infection as viral proteins specifically bind to modified Sia -examples include human coronavirus OC43 and HKU1, and influenza C and D viruses, which all require 9-O-Ac Sia for cell infection (34, 35) .",

Influenza A viruses (IAV) use Sia as primary receptors for host recognition and cell entry through the activity of two surface glycoproteins that interact with Sia, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is a trimeric protein that binds Sia to initiate the endocytic uptake of the virus by the cell, leading to fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane after exposure of the virus to low pH (36) . NA is a sialidase which 125 cleaves Sia from the mucus, cell surface, and from viral glycoproteins, allowing the virus to penetrate through mucus to the epithelial cells and reducing the aggregation of virions after budding from the surface of cells (37). Previous studies have suggested that 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac Sia are expressed on cells or in tissues of many IAV host species and there is some evidence that these modifications may be inhibitory for NA activity and HA binding (38, 39) .

Neu5Gc is highly expressed in some tissues of IAV natural host species, including pigs 140 and horses, and is also present in the tissues of mice and guinea pigs, which are frequently used as animals models (9, 12, 41) .

This seems to indicate that while the same Table 1) , while, as expected, the CMAH -/mice showed only Neu5Ac in all tissues, similar to amounts reported previously for some of those tissues (44) (Supplemental Table 2 ). The lack of Neu5Gc in CMAH -/mice was also seen in GI tissues, indicating that Neu5Gc from dietary sources was not 180 detectably being taken up by these mice, as is seen in humans who eat a diet containing that Neu5Gc (46) . In the WT mice, tissues showed a great deal of variability in Neu5Gc expression.",

There was about 1.5 to 3 fold higher levels of O-acetyl Sia in most tissues of the CMAH knock-out mice ( Fig. 3C; Supplemental Table 2 ), as has been reported previously (44). The levels of 4-O-Ac Sia were generally low, making up ~2% of the Sia in small intestine (duodenum) and ~1% in spleen, testes, and esophagus. Mouse colon samples showed the highest levels of total O-acetylation, 190 with ~17% of Sia having one or more O-acetyl modification, again primarily 9-O-Ac. Given the patterns seen using the HE-Fc virolectin staining, the 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac forms must be present at high levels within or on certain cell sub-populations, as well as within mucus or mucussecreting cells. For example, the high levels of 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac found in the mouse colon were most likely associated with secreted mucus as most of those modified Sia were present in 195 goblet cells (Fig. 2B) . However, the differences seen between probe binding and the ratios of the different modified Sia within the total Sia underscore the importance of quantifying the different forms.",

Strong staining for 9-O-Ac in human respiratory tissues, and also within the submucosal glands of human respiratory tissue have also been reported, indicating that mucus from these glands could be enriched in O-acetylated Sia (47, 48) . To determine if human respiratory mucus was enriched in 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac, secreted mucus from primary normal human bronchial 205 epithelial cells (NHBE) as well as conditioned media from human alveolar basal epithelial adenocarcinoma A549 cells, were analyzed by HPLC to determine Sia composition.

While the proteins in saliva differ from those found in 215 respiratory mucus, they do contain some of the same heavily glycosylated proteins including mucins like MUC5B (49) (50) (51) . Human saliva was similar to the secreted mucus from NHBE and Erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs) express high levels of sialylated surface molecules, primarily on glycophorins, and are used in IAV research to study the interactions of HA binding specificity, determining viral titer through the hemagglutination assay, and inhibition of hemagglutination by antibodies (HAI assay) (52, 53). It has long been known that IAV varies in 230 hemagglutination of RBCs from different species, at least in part due to differences in the Sia linkages present. The structures of HAs with Sia bound often suggest that modification of the C4, 5, 7, and/or 9 positions would influence IAV interactions with Sia. We found that chicken and guinea pig RBCs, which are often used to titer IAV virus and as the standard substrate for HAI assays, contained almost exclusively unmodified Neu5Ac, as did those from humans and 235 dogs (Fig. 4C,D) .

It is clear, however, that O-280 acetyl and Neu5Gc modifications inhibit the activities of many different IAV NA and of NeuA, and that multiple modifications, such as di-O-acetyl modifications, or Neu5Gc that is also Oacetylated, were even more inhibitory, showing high resistance to most of the viral and bacterial NAs tested here.",

To specifically compare the effects of added Neu5Gc or Neu5Ac on the efficiency of 315 infection, the same three IAV strains were incubated with mouse serum from either wild-type mice (>80% Neu5Gc) or CMAH -/mice (100% Neu5Ac) prior to inoculation of cells (Fig. 8B) . In this case no specific trend was detected for the three viruses tested. Victoria H3N2 showed almost complete inhibition of infection by both sera, while PR8 H1N1 had a lower level of inhibition. Only pH1N1 showed a significant difference in response to the serums, with the WT 320 mouse serum having a much stronger inhibitory effect compared to the CMAH -/serum. This suggests that Neu5Gc vs. Neu5Ac inhibition may vary by virus strain, and that likely depends on some combination of HA binding specificity and NA activity.

The levels in most other tissues varied between 2 and 9%, although these would likely be associated with higher levels on the smaller subsets of cells that were positive for staining with the probes. Neu5Gc was also present in many wild-type mouse 345 tissues with expression varying widely (between 10 and 80%). This is consistent with staining for Neu5Gc previously reported in some mouse tissues (44). 4-O-Ac Sia was found in small quantities in only a few tissues, with the highest being found in small intestine (~2%). This is consistent with previous findings of 4-O-Ac levels in mouse brain and liver quantified by GC/MS, although gut associated levels of 4-O-Ac were much higher in that study, possibly due to has not yet been identified, little is known about its synthesis, expression, or regulation (22, 23).",

However, human saliva and secreted mucus from respiratory cells contained mostly unmodified Neu5Ac, suggesting different expression of modified Sia in the mucus of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues. This may be due to the particular functional characteristics of the microbiome in the GI tract compared to other mucosal sites, where 7,9-O-370 and 9-O-Ac on colonic mucus may decrease bacterial degradation of sialylated glycans, perhaps improving mucus integrity (69, 70) . Microbiome interactions may also explain the increased O-acetyl modifications found on both cow and mouse saliva. Cows are ruminants and as part of their digestion, regurgitate partially digested food from their microbe-rich rumen into their mouth to continue chewing as a cud to extract more nutrients. Somewhat similarly, mice 375 are coprophagic and consume feces, along with associated microbes, to re-digest again to improve absorption of nutrients. This would give both cows and mice the potential for more complex mucus and microbe interactions in both the oral cavity and the gut, thus having Oacetyl modifications on sialylated glycans on saliva mucus proteins could be advantageous by preventing degradation. However, further research is needed on the roles of these modifications 380 for the interactions between oral and colonic mucus with the microbiome.",

This could confirm previous findings that the density of Sia on these serum proteins is the strongest inhibitory factor rather than the type of modified Sia present, as shown for incubation with horse serum (73).

We found a great deal of variability in both the amounts and types of modified Sia present.

Esterase treatment, therefore, allows more efficient binding to the BSM and greater inhibition of IAV infection. For some 400 viruses there is likely a complementarity between the inhibitory effects of 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac on HA and NA, where lower HA binding allows the viruses to avoid binding to Sia forms that NA cannot remove efficiently.

Virus was diluted in PBS to give MOI of 0.5 and then mixed with 20 \u00b5g untreated BSM or esterase treated BSM and incubated for 45 min at room temp. For mouse serum inhibition, virus was mixed with 200 \u00b5g wild-type or CMAH -/serum instead. Serum-or mucin-treated virus was then added to washed MDCK cells and incubated for 1 hr with tilting to prevent cell drying. Inoculum was then media added and cells were incubated for 10 hrs. Cells were then harvested, stained with an anti-influenza A NP antibody, and analyzed for infection using a Millipore Guava EasyCyte Plus flow cyotometer (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) with analysis using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). Statistical analyses were performed in PRISM software (GraphPad, version 8). A) Sialic acids (purple diamonds) terminate glycan chains on glycolipids and glycoproteins as part of the glycocalyx on the surface of cells. They can also terminate glycans on secreted 540 glycoproteins, like mucins, that are an important component of the protective mucosal barrier in gastrointestinal and respiratory tissue. B) Sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac) can be modified by the addition of O-acetyl modifications at the C-4, 7, and 9 positions, or by the hydroxylation of the N-acetyl group at C-5 to form N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) by the enzyme cytidine 5'-monophosphate-N-545 acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH). The sialate O-acetyltransferase, CasD1, adds acetyl groups at C-7 from which it migrates to the C-9 position (Neu5,9Ac 2 ) under physiological conditions. This can allow for an additional acetyl group to be added by CasD1 to C-7 (Neu5,7,9Ac 3 ). The sialate O-acetylesterase, SIAE, can remove these acetyl modifications, restoring the unmodified Neu5Ac form of sialic acid. O-acetyl modifications can also be added at 550 the C-4 position by a specific 4-O-acetyltransferase (Neu4,5Ac 2 ) and removed by a 4-Oacetylesterase.
