            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia among patients with severe respiratory disease. 1 Since the first cases of MERS emerged, a wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic infection to fatal pneumonia, has been documented among the confirmed MERS-CoV cases. 2, 3 Initially, MERS-CoV predominantly affected middle-aged males; however, as the epidemic continued to spread, the gap between males and females has narrowed, and all age groups, from children to the elderly, have been affected. [4] [5] [6] [7] After an average incubation period of approximately 5 days, 8 patients typically present with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, such as cough and shortness of breath often combined with nonspecific signs of the disease, such as fatigue, myalgia, fever, rhinorrhea, headaches, sore throat, vomiting, or diarrhea. 9 In patients with pneumonia, MERS can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, multi-organ failure, and death. 9, 10 Moreover, the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease frequently leads to secondary complications, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation and hyperkalemia. 11, 12 On the other end of the spectrum, healthy immune-competent patients are more likely to have asymptomatic or mild infections which could have gone undetected and unreported. 6, 13 The MERS-CoV is a positive-strand RNA virus, which through cross species transmission infects both humans and animals. 14, 15 The high propensity of MERS-CoV to cross species barriers is attributed to its ability to recombine and form new variants within the infected organism. 16 This property of MERS-CoV, together with the lack of sufficient knowledge of the pathways by which the virus is transmitted to humans, is a matter of grave concern among virologists, public health researchers, and health activists. 2, 16 Despite a significant research effort in this area, the transmission of MERS-CoV is still puzzling many scientists and clinicians. 17 One of the early hypotheses explaining the transmission of MERS-CoV from its natural host to humans raised the possibility that the virus may have originated in insectivorous bats. 17 However, people do not commonly have contact with these species, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula where most cases have been reported. 15, 17, 18 Conversely, human contacts with dromedary camels are commonplace in the Arabian Peninsula, especially in the regions with high reported incidence rates of MERS, suggesting that camels may be the source of human MERS-CoV infections. 15, 18, 19 This possibility was supported by the detection of the MERS-CoV in lymph nodes of camels in one of the slaughterhouses in Qatar; this finding suggested that MERS-CoV could be present in the camel meat. 20 However, in an experiment involving infection of three camels with MERS-CoV, the virus was undetectable in their organs and the meat. 21 Even if the camel meat is not associated with the transmission of the virus, almost two-thirds of the camels examined at a slaughterhouse in Qatar were shedding nasal excretion infected with MERS-CoV indicating the possibility of droplet transmission. 20 In agreement with this finding, MERS-CoV genomes were detected in nasal swabs collected from dromedaries in Oman, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Kuwait, Egypt, Iran, and Israel confirmed the presence of MERS-CoV genomes. 14 Several cases of infection in Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been linked to drinking raw camel milk. 4, 14 Given the potential causal relationship between the consumption of camel-derived food products and MERS, and the fact that the virus can be easily destroyed by pasteurization, 14 the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against the consumption of raw camel milk and uncooked camel meat. 20, 21 Additionally, the WHO strongly discouraged drinking camel urine, which also could represent a risk factor for MERS-CoV infection. 22, 23 Although camels were implicated as the source of MERS-CoV transmission, the majority of the MERS patients did not come into close contact with camels or other livestock animals. 24 Conversely, the vast majority of MERS cases have been associated with health care settings, 24-26 with a particularly high risk of contracting the infection in overcrowded emergency rooms. 27 In fact, most of the reported MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia and South Korea were due to human-to-human transmission, which in most cases happened in the absence of adequate infection control measures in health care facilities. 28, 29 This mode of MERS-CoV transmission was confirmed both epidemiologically and by genetic documentation of the viruses implicated in hospital and household MERS outbreaks. 16 Therefore, the importance of using the appropriate contact and droplet precautions in health care facilities cannot be overestimated. 30 According to the WHO, from April 2012 to June 2019, 2,449 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS were reported, of which 2,058 cases were in Saudi Arabia resulting in a casefatality rate of 37.2%. 31 The incidence of MERS continues to rise, with seven new cases reported in June 2019 alone from Saudi Arabia. 31 Overall, the majority of cases occurred in health care facilities, however, the routes of direct or indirect zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV remain unknown. At present, no vaccine or specific treatment is available, although serious attempts to develop preventive therapy are ongoing. 32 According to the World Bank, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak resulted in an estimated global economic cost of $16 billion, 5 and it is believed that the MERS-CoV infection toll on the overall global economy, and particularly the Saudi economy, will also be enormous. The 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea resulted in an estimated economic loss of $10 billion in the tourism sector alone. 33 Although among countries affected by MERS Saudi Arabia was impacted the most, no effort was made to estimate the immense impact of this epidemic on either the macro-or microeconomic levels. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the direct medical costs associated with the management of MERS-CoV cases at one of the tertiary referral hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",

Despite these limitations, it should be emphasized that this is the first effort to highlight the direct medical cost of managing MERS cases in Saudi Arabia, a country where more than 80% of MERS cases were reported. 31 Most of the patients in the study sample had chronic health conditions, such as diabetes (58%), hypertension (37%), chronic kidney disease (17%), and cancer (12%). This is in agreement with the previously published studies which showed a significant relationship between multiple comorbidities and MERS-CoV infection. 17 Moreover, the mean age of the patients was over 50 years which is also consistent with the notion that MERS-CoV rarely affects children and young adults. 9 Notably, the low rate of mortality among the study sample (8.33%) was significantly lower than the average mortality rate reported in the literature (35-40%). 9, 31 This difference may be largely attributable to the small sample size and relatively short length of hospital stay of patients in the present investigation compared with previously published studies ( Table 4) .",

Onethird of the patients included in the analysis were health care workers. The presence of such a high percentage of health professionals among MERS patients raises serious questions regarding the effectiveness and/or enforcement of infection control policies in hospitals. Moreover, it exposes the lack of response among decision makers to past calls for improvement, 25, 26 providing a grim outlook for the future. The inadequate prevention of nosocomial infections is further underlined by the fact that four of the 24 MERS cases (16.67%) were admitted for symptoms that were not related to MERS infection, and the disease was identified three to 6 days later, suggesting that those patients caught the infection during their hospitalization, which questions again the effectiveness of the hospital infection control policy. Additionally, the unavailability of the data for 20 out of 44 MERS cases unveils poor documentation practices and lack of mandatory management protocols (Figure 1) .",

The high prevalence of MERS-CoV infections caused by humanto-human contact calls into question the effectiveness of infection control policies at the national level and reveals the inadequacy of the preventive measures taken by the Saudi Ministry of Health that persists after more than 3 years of the MERS-CoV outbreak. 25 In fact, the current analysis identified 13 cases (54%) that were discharged within one day of their MERS diagnosis mainly due to the lack of available treatment and the fear of nosocomial transmission. However, the decision to discharge those patients could increase the risk of MERS-CoV transmission outside the hospital, particularly to those at higher risk, such as immunocompromised patients with diabetes and other health conditions prevalent in Saudi Arabia. 34 This is concerning given that approximately 46% of the cases were exposed to a MERS case within the past 2 weeks prior to their admission.",

To improve the accuracy of the current analysis on direct medical cost estimation for MERS patients, health researchers should be granted access to the medical files of all MERS cases. This may help in highlighting the deficiencies in the infection control policies. Finally, an enforceable nationwide policy for infection control, and standardized protocols for the management of MERS-CoV infections should be implemented.
