Each of the two methods assigned a numeric value between 0 and 1 to each pair of proteins, representing the probability that the pair has an interaction. The two probabilities were then combined in a logistic regression model. Probabilities reported by the logistic regression model were taken to be the final probability representing the possibility that a protein pair is a true interaction. We predicted protein interactions for pairs with probabilities greater than 0.95 and removed proteins having more than 80 predictions to obtain a final set of reasonable size. The final set of predictions contained 24,798 interactions covering 4,702 fly proteins with an average distance of 4.15 links between proteins.",

We used the LexA-based yeast twohybrid mating assay 14 to test two sets of predicted interactions: 469 protein pairs predicted to interact by Sharan at al. 15 based on cross-species conservation, and 2047 interactions predicted using a classifier built on multiple lines of evidence (see main text). At the same time, we tested a background set of 2354 randomly selected pairs of proteins. Assays were conducted using sequence-verified yeast two-hybrid clones as previously described 16 . Briefly, BD and AD yeast clones were re-arrayed into 96-well plates (using a Beckman Biomek Span 8 robot) and grown to saturation in 100 \u00b5l of the appropriate media for each clone type. A Beckman Biomek FX 96-channel robot was used to plate 6\u00b5l of each clone type onto a single YPD plate, which was then incubated for 36-48 hours to allow mating and formation of diploids. Yeast cells were replicated to two different diploid selection plates to assay for two-hybrid reporter activity: one plate lacking leucine to assay the LEU2 reporter, and the other containing X-Gal to assay the lacZ reporter. Growth on the Leu-plate and \"blueness\" on the X-Gal plate were scored using scales of 0 -3 and 0 -5, respectively, as previously described 17 . These two values were corrected by subtracting the LEU2 or lacZ scores that the BD clone produced by itself (in a separate auto-activation assay). Pairs for which the sum of corrected LEU2 and lacZ scores exceeded 0.9 were recorded as positives. The quantitative results for all assayed pairs are shown in Supplementary Table 2 .",
