Secondary cases has been reported in several European (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Greece), Asian (Malaysia and Phillipines) and Middle East Area (MEA) (Egypt) countries, and the potential for a pandemic as for SARS has been discussed. 4 ",

The origin of the MERS-CoV has been much discussed and bats were early mentioned due to close phylogeny between certain bat CoV's and MERS-CoV. 1 The phylogeny of Coronaviruses has been extensively reviewed. 7 Recently three entire MERS-CoV genomes from Jeddah outbreak have been sequenced and the data was presented at the Scientific Advisory Board Meeting of the WHO Collaborating Center for Mass Gathering Medicine, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, April 28 -29 (Drosten C unpublished). The overall finding was announced the 26 th April, 8 and the conclusion is that overall the virus is stable and there is no sign of mutations indicating an adaptation to cause sustained human to human transmission.",

Conclusions 1. Sequencing of MERS-CoV isolates from Jeddah patients the virus seems stable, showing no signs so far of mutations to indicate an adaption to humans with increased risk of human to human infections. 2. There is accumulating evidence for an animal reservoir in dromedary camels. Transmission is thought to be due to close physical contact or due to consumption of camel products. 3. The epidemiology since the virus was first found in 2012 is compatible with multiple introductions into humans from the animal reservoir, with no long-term sustained human-tohuman transmission. 4. There is no human reservoir of cases with few or no symptoms. 5. The basic reproductive rate has been estimated to range below 1. Preliminary data from contact studies suggest a considerably lower rate below 0.5, suggesting that the virus has no pandemic potential. Special situations such as hospitalization with breaches in infection control practice can however cause local outbreaks with short transmission chains. 6. Nosocomial infection is an important risk factor for human to human transmission. Thus infection prevention and control measures are crucial to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV within health care facilities. Hospital infection control procedures needs to be emphazised and enforced. The Jeddah outbreak showed that it is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. ",
