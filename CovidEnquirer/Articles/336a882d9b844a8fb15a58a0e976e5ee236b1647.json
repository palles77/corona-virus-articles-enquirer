Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and US President Jimmy Carter each commissioned studies of the impact of physical limits on the global future and their national prospects. Although these studies examined the outlook only as far as 2000, their conclusions to that date confirmed those of the original LTG study. Right from the start, however, economists were critical, even abusive, creating a negative impression that persists in some quarters, todayddespite the rapidly accumulating evidence of the basic robustness of the LTG projections and assumptions. Robert Gillette, who attended the LTG launch for the journal Science, noted that the \"assumption of inevitable economic growth\" represents \"the very foundation\" of economics. Any \"limit\" to growth challenged this foundation. It is unsurprizing that most economists attacked the ideas vigorously, an assault that illustrates the conflict between the core assumptions of economists and those of the physical sciences.",

In 2018, J\u00f8rgen Randers, part of the original LTG team, using an updated model, compared the LTG projections with real world data up to 2017. He found that real world outcomes have approximated the second LTG scenario, the \"standard run with extra resources,\" or \"pollution crisis.\" based on observed data further processed by Turner (up to 2010) trent modelled by the LTG study (1970-2100) (LTG) peak health? 2010 c2030: population declines due to increasing cases of regional overload 2050 2100 Meadows et al. for 1900-70 and updated by Turner with data to 2010.

            "text": "The concept of the ecological footprint is among the most important developments in thinking related to the LTG. Devised in the 1990s by William Rees and Mathis Wackernagel, this measure enables ecological impacts (individual, national or global) to be quantified and compared. On one hand, it estimates the ecological assets required to produce the resources consumed by any discrete population; this includes food and fiber plants, livestock and fish, timber and other forest products, space for urban infrastructure and whatever \"sinks\" are needed to absorb the waste produced, especially carbon dioxide emissions. The unit of measurement adopted is the area of biologically productive land and water, usually expressed in hectares. On the other hand, the ecological footprint also estimates the productivity of a country's actual ecological assets (cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land). Researchers using the ecological footprint methodology calculated that, while the world's biocapacity averages 1.7 ha. per capita, high-income \"developed\" countries greatly exceed this average. Examples include the United States (8.8 ha. per capita) and the United Kingdom (5.1 ha. per capita). The US, which has far more productive land available than the United Kingdom, appropriates 1.27 times its own biocapacity through imports, and the United Kingdom almost three times. Many island nations and arid countries such as Saudi Arabia exceed their biocapacity by a factor of more than ten. The ecological footprint has the strengths and weaknesses of any aggregate indicator: the concepts and units are easy to understand by policy-makers and the public, but it does not encompass all aspects of human environmental impact (methane, e.g., is not integrated). This matrix needs to be used in conjunction with other indicators.",

This is unfortunate. The persistence of single-issue approaches to address complex problems retards our ability to act effectively. This is the case where there is singular focus on climate change. The impact on human health and wellbeing is modified by many interacting factorsdincluding population, global demand and availability of resources and services and the waste and pollution we generate. Other than noting the exponential growth of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, LTG did not address climate change as such, but it modeled these factors as part of a complex system. Although infrequently, the issues of resource depletion and population pressure have featured in some medical curricula, from at least the 1950s, preceding publication of the LTG by over a decade. Pioneering writers and speakers have included Colin Bertram, Peter Parsons, and Roger Short. John Guillebaud, the world's first clinician professor of family planning and reproductive health, has repeatedly spoken on the issue of both consumption and population, to diverse audiences including medical practitioners, nurses, medical students and others, since 1971.",

It is therefore of great concern that the Global Ecological Footprint Network (see \"The Ecological Footprint\" section) estimates that 150% of [global] biocapacity is consumed per annum.",

Millions of people living in poverty, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, suffer multi-system consequences of air pollution, both indoor and outdoor, from smoke generated by their own household and by other households. In many locations, this is aggravated by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. Many people, particularly women and children, undertake daily laborious effort to obtain fuel and water. Access to electrical power, and even gas for cooking would bring significant improvements in health to the 1.3 billion people living without electricity.",

These are used not only for transport, heating and electrical power (over 60% globally), but also as a chemical stock to manufacture plastics and to make fertilizer. But, just as in the past when our ancestors bred, trained, housed and fed donkeys and draft horses for assistance with laborious tasks, fossil fuel needs to be wrested from the environment, whether drilled for, dug by hand or removed by robotic shovels. These processes themselves take energy. In addition, energy released or captured from these sources needs to be distributed and the infrastructure to do that needs to be maintained. Coal needs to be transported and burned, with some of its energy captured through combustion. Electrical energy needs to be distributed and regulated irrespective of its source (including solar, wind, hydro and tidal). To manufacture wind turbines or solar panels requires energy, as does the mining infrastructure described above. Life-cycle assessment allows a full quantification of the energy invested in any form of energy extracted, which is clearly significant.",

In contrast, a review published in 2016 in Nature Communications found that, globally, up until 2017, solar panels may have yielded no energy beyond that required for their manufacture and installation. In other words, under the least optimistic scenario, solar panels, cumulatively, have been a sink for energy, rather than a source until very recently. More encouragingly, the EROEI for solar appears to have increased considerably in the last decade, perhaps to 30 or 35, especially in locations with high insolation, such as in the tropics. The climate footprint of solar is much lower than of coal and will continue to decline, especially as the efficiency of panels increases and the electricity they generate is used to manufacture additional ones.",

In addition, Ugo Bardi and Sgouris Sgouridis argue that the window for a successful transition is narrow: a very large investment of available energy is required, while still maintaining adequate energy for ongoing services. Moreover, the world's economic system may fail to allocate the necessary resources in the necessary timeframe (by 2050 in this analysis). Bardi and Sgouridis are skeptical that market forces can effect this transition. They calculated that, as of 2017, capital investment is only about one tenth of what is required. Energy investment is also inadequate. Though not impossible, any transition to renewables will be challenging and requires a substantially greater rate of energy and capital investment than is currently allocated.",

These risks are escalating and we recognize the shortfall in assessing the health risk of new pollutants, entities and behaviors. When considered together with economic and population growth, and with ever-increasing resource and energy use, these environmental health risks may foreshadow significant population decline. By using the LTG and PB frameworks in this contribution, society can frame preventative measures on the scale at which this is required.
