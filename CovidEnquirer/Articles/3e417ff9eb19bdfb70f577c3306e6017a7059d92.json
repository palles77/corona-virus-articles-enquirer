In 1573, Xin'an county was established and was entitled to administer Hong Kong for more than two hundred years since that time. Following the end of the first Opium War, the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842 ceded the island of Hong Kong to Britain in perpetuity. Kowloon, Stonecutters' Island and some small islands were annexed in 1860. In 1898, Britain acquired, under the 'Treaty of Peking', what is known as the New Territories and 236 associated islands, which were mainly agricultural lands, which were leased from the Qing dynasty , on a 99-year lease. At present, Hong Kong consists of the island of Hong Kong (83 sq. km), Stonecutters' Island, Kowloon Peninsula, and the New Territories on the adjoining mainland, with 1,068 sq. km of land and a population of just over six million.",

On 19 December 1984, the Chinese and British governments issued a joint declaration in relation to the question of Hong Kong. As a result, the sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred from the UK to the PRC on 1 July 1997. 2 Upholding national unity and territorial integrity, maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and taking account of its history and realities, China has made Hong Kong a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in accordance with the provisions of Article 31 of the Constitution of the PRC. The Joint Declaration also provides that for 50 years after 1997, Hong Kong's lifestyle will remain unchanged. The territory will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in relation to foreign and defense affairs, and China's socialist system and policies will not be put into practice in the SAR. Under the principle of 'one country, two systems', 'the socialist system and policies shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong special administrative region, and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years'. 3 Since the Asian financial crisis, Hong Kong has tried to exploit its connections with mainland China in order to boost its economy. The measures introduced included the relaxation of controls against tourists and skilled workers from the mainland, and the promotion of economic integration with the Pearl River delta. Hong Kong also proposed the formation of an FTA (free trade area) with the mainland. On 29 June 2003, the 'Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement', or 'Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement' (CEPA) was signed between the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. 4 In addition, annual supplements have been signed between the Mainland and Hong Kong governments. This was the first free-trade agreement for either the mainland or Hong Kong. ",

On 25 October 1945, Taiwan and Penghu islands returned unconditionally to the Chinese government, marking the end of Japan's colonization.

From an economic viewpoint, Hong Kong and Macau each have an autonomous entity, are separate customs territories and founding members of the WTO. Each has an independent fiscal and monetary system, issuing their own currencies that are linked to the US dollar.

As a result, significant social and economic differences have been present in the four parts of the area, especially since 1949. In what follows we will analyze them in detail. Table 15 .1 shows the basic social and economic indicators of greater China in the early years of the twentyfirst century. In 2003, Taiwan's GDP was 1.8 times that of Hong Kong. The GDP of the mainland was 4.9 times that of Taiwan and 8.9 times that of Hong Kong. The mainland's 2003 exports of US$438 billion surpassed Taiwan's exports of US$144 billion and also substantially surpassed the level of Hong Kong's domestic exports (that is, exports made domestically in Hong Kong) of US$16 billion. The figure for Hong Kong's total exports (that is, including re-exports) of US$225 billion is large because Hong Kong is re-exporting Chinese products to third countries and third-country products to China.

Hong Kong's GDP contracted by more than 5 percent in 1998, the first recorded instance of negative annual growth since official GDP figures became available in 1961. Though the Hong Kong economy recovered in 1999-2000, the slowdown of the US economy and the September 11 terrorist attack led to another recession, and GDP growth fell to 0.5 percent in 2001. Recovery in the second half of 2002 was interrupted by the outbreak of SARS in March 2003. Since the Asian financial crisis, Hong Kong has tried to exploit its connections with mainland China in order to boost its economy. The measures introduced included the relaxation of controls against tourists and skilled workers from the mainland, and the promotion of economic integration with the Pearl River Delta. Hong Kong also proposed the formation of an FTA (free trade area) with the mainland, resulting in the implementation of the 'Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement' (CEPA) on 29 June 2003. The CEPA has brought positive economic benefits to both Hong Kong and the mainland.",

For example, mainland China has adequate and various agricultural products and oil, coal, building materials, some high-tech products, excess and cheap labor, and a huge domestic market. However, mainland China lacks capital, advanced equipment, technology, and management experience, especially in its western, inland areas. Taiwan, with its high levels of capital saving, its portable advanced equipment, and vanguard agricultural and industrial products and management experience, suffers from a shortage of energy and industrial resources, and faces increasing inefficiency and high costs of labor supply. Furthermore, its economic development seems to have been restricted by the limited domestic market. As the freest economies in the world, Hong Kong and Macau have capital surplus, favorable conditions for international trade, and advanced management experience in commercial and financial markets; while they are severely lacking agricultural and industrial resources, especially fresh water, foodstuffs, energy and land. In addition, like Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau are also facing a serious deficiency and high cost of labor. 7 Traditionally, both Hong Kong and Taiwan are strong in labor-intensive, export-oriented industries: Hong Kong's niches are in clothing, toys, watches, and electronics, while Taiwan's are in footwear, umbrellas, textiles, and electronics. Such traditional industries have all but relocated to the mainland. The opening up of the mainland came at the right time for Hong Kong and Taiwan as they had accumulated valuable human capital in the management and manufacturing of labor-intensive products for exports from the 1950s to the 1970s. However, successful export-oriented industrialization had raised the levels of their wages, and their labor-intensive industries were threatened in the 1980s. The majority of manufacturing firms in Hong Kong and Taiwan were small, and lacked the ability to operate internationally; for example, to relocate to Southeast Asia. Without the opening of the mainland, the vast majority of these small firms would have gone bankrupt. However, the opening of the mainland allowed small firms to relocate to a culturally familiar environment and thereby utilize their valuable know-how to build a 'global factory' -that is, a production base dominating the world market (Sung, 2004, p. 3) .",

In November 1992, the mainland China-based Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) and the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) held a meeting in Hong Kong. Three months before the meeting, the Taiwan side (on August 1, 1992) published the following statement in respect of its interpretation of the meaning of 'one China': 9. The PRC's attitude towards Taiwan's position in the international community may be briefly summarized by Jiang (1995, p. 2) as that '... Under the principle of one China and in accordance with the charters of the relevant international organizations, Taiwan has become a member of the Asian Development Bank, the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, and other international economic organizations in the name of \"Chinese Taipei\".'

Thereafter, the restrictions of the cross-Taiwan Strait trade were gradually worn away under the principle of 'indirect trading' -that is, the direct trade partners should be located outside mainland China and trade movements should be via third countries (regions). Until the 1990s, the cross-Taiwan Strait trade had still been managed through a 'concentrated' approach in mainland China, not allowing the mainland's foreign trade companies to deal directly with Taiwanese companies outside Hong Kong and Macau. This policy, nevertheless, has promoted the two sides' foreign trade companies to open up either sub-companies or branches of their own in Hong Kong and Macau. During the early period, Taiwanese investment in mainland China was usually conducted under the names of investors from Hong Kong, Macau, overseas Chinese and others who would nominally be accepted by the two sides. 12 In order to overcome the lack of foreign capital, 11. The full text of the Law is posted on the website of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of the PRC (http://www.gwytb.gov.cn/en/ Special/OneChinaPrinciple/201103/t20110317_1790121.htm. Accessed November 10, 2011.) 12. In 1985, Chen Guoshun, a Taiwanese businessman, was sentenced in Taipei to 12 years in prison for 'rebellious' activities. The prosecutor charged Chen with illegally entering mainland China in 1984, signing a contract, and engaging in direct investment in the mainland. Chen's sentence sent a shock wave to those who had engaged or intended to conduct direct business activities (Pai Shing Semimonthly, 1 March 1986, p. 52). mainland China introduced a flexible policy entitled 'attraction of the Taiwanese capital via Hong Kong and overseas Chinese' (yi gang yin tai, yi qiao yin tai) which was intended to encourage Taiwanese businessmen to invest in mainland China. Since October 1990, when the Taiwanese government formally allowed Taiwanese businessmen to invest in mainland China, it has always required that the Taiwanese investors should be under the names of their sub-companies housed in the third areas. In order to encourage Taiwanese businessmen to invest in the mainland, mainland China promulgated the 'Regulations Concerning the Promotion of the Taiwanese Compatriots' Investment' in July 1988 and the 'Law of Protecting the Taiwanese Compatriots Investment' in March 1994, respectively.",

In July 1993, financial movements were able to extend from individual to business activities, and furthermore banks in the Taiwan area were able to receive funds sent indirectly from mainland China.

On June 30, 2010, the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) was signed between and the ARATS and the SEF, both of which represent the governments of the People's Republic of China (mainland China) and the Republic of China (Taiwan), respectively. The ECFA is a preferential trade agreement that aims to reduce tariffs and commercial barriers between the two sides. For a long period of time, the Chinese government uses its influence on neighboring economic powers to prevent them from signing free-trade agreements (FTAs) with Taiwan. Instead, under the leadership of the Kuomintang, Taipei was motivated to sign the ECFA with mainland China partly in hope that once it has this agreement the PRC will stop pressuring other countries to avoid such agreements with Taiwan. The ECFA has been compared with the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangements (CEPA) signed by mainland China with its two Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macau) .",

According to CEC (1996) , the direct cross-Taiwan Strait links would have resulted in a net saving of US$731.5 million per annum for postal, remittance, air, and shipping services between the two sides of Taiwan Strait, including: (1) US$248.0 million for shipping service; (2) US$437.5 million (6.95 million hours) for air service; (3) US$24.0 million for postal service; and (4) US$22.0 million or more for remittance service. Cited from Cankao Xiaoxi (1996, p. 8) . The distance and time for the direct air travel across the Strait have been shortened significantly. A plane taking off from Beijing to Taipei, for instance, will fly 1,100 km less with its flying time becoming shortened by 80 minutes. Meanwhile, direct shipping lanes will cut costs and reduce time for businesspeople. Taiwan authorities are anticipating that shipping companies will save NT$1.2 billion (US$36 million) and airlines at least NT$3 billion a year. 15 The direct postal link will cut the time it takes to send express mail from around a week to only two or three days. The convenience will greatly facilitate cross-Strait trade, economic cooperation, and personnel exchanges.",

In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America, and the other parts of the world. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 further accelerated the migration. The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.",

Compared with its predecessor, the Zhou dynasty, the Qin dynasty had an enlarged territory, but it was short lived (see Tables 15.4 and 15 .5 for a comparison of the two dynasties). Historians have identified many factors leading to the shortness of the Qin empire, which include, among others, Qin Shihuang's tyranny, harsh law imposed on the lives of people, large expenditure on big projects (such as the Great Wall) and persecution of Confucianism. The direct cause of the Qin's collapse, however, was initially connected with a long-distance trip of the border patrol led by Chen Sheng and Wu Guang. For example, the following was reported in Sima Qian's (104 BC) famous book Shiji (historical records): The Han dynasty, after which the members of the ethnic majority in China, the 'people of Han', are named, was notable also for its military prowess. The empire expanded westward as far as the rim of the Tarim Basin (in modern Xinjiang), making possible relatively secure caravan traffic across Central Asia to Antioch, Baghdad, and Alexandria. The paths of caravan traffic are often called the 'silk route' because the route was used to export Chinese silk to the Roman Empire. Chinese armies also invaded and annexed parts of northern Vietnam and northern Korea toward the end of the second century BC. Han control of peripheral regions was generally insecure, however. To ensure peace with non-Chinese local powers, the Han court developed a mutually beneficial 'tributary system'. Non-Chinese states were allowed to remain autonomous in exchange for symbolic acceptance of Han lordship. Tributary ties were confirmed and strengthened through intermarriages at the ruling level and periodic exchanges of gifts and goods. In 25 AD, after years of chaos, the new Han ruler moved its capital from Chang'an (today's Xi'an) to Luoyang in the east.",

In the Tang dynasty, the Chinese culture influenced as far away as India in the western side of the Himalayas and Japan in the east. For example, the traditional written language, architecture, and political institutions of Japan and Korea were to some extent imitations of the Tang model. However, at the late stage of the dynasty, the huge size of the territory and the capital's proximity to the north and the west frontiers were full with domestic chaos and invasions by barbarians. As soon as the Tang declined in the early tenth century, five dynastic changes occurred along the valley of the Yellow River and ten regional powers controlled different sections of the Yangtze River. 20 After the founders of the Song dynasty unified China in AD 960, there had been two locations that could serve as the capital: Luoyang and Kaifeng, in the western and the eastern Henan province, respectively. Economically, Kaifeng was a better choice, given its convenient transport and communication facilities. This can be witnessed by the rapid economic, commercial, and technological developments enjoyed by Kaifeng and by China as a whole during the North Song dynasty (AD 960-1127). However, Kaifeng was not an ideal city for military purposes, since it was so near to its northern enemies that no geographical barriers (with the exception of the Yellow River) could protect it from invasions. Clearly, this has been witnessed by the forced abandonment of Kaifeng and northern and central China by the Song court in 1127; as a result, the Song's capital was moved from Kaifeng southwardly to Lin'an (today's Hangzhou). By contrast, Luoyang is an ideal city for military, but not for economical, purposes. Transportation between Luoyang and the economic center in southeast provinces was very costly since there was no convenient waterway.",

Then, why was Yuan's capital transferred from Karakorum (in modern Mongolia) to Beijing? The first possible driving force for the southward move of the capital might be the change in territorial size. As a result of the fall of the Jin and the Song courts, most of Chinese territory, formerly under the control of the Jin and the Song dynasties, had been under the Mongol's control. If Karakorum is a geographically optimal location as the capital for the Mongol state (AD 1206-1271), ceteris paribus, the optimal location for the capital of the newly established, spatially enlarged dynasty, the Yuan should move to the south.",

During the second half of the nineteenth century, many peasant leaders and national heroes rose time and again, eventually resulting in the disintegration of this nation.",

A comparison of the Chinese and Korean dynasties (see Figure 15 .4) indicates that the Korean dynasties did sustain a much longer average lifespan than the Chinese ones during approximately the same period of time. If political and economic factors were not quite responsible for these differences, geographical factors (size and location) must have contributed. Furthermore, we can find that the three Korean dynasties had significantly different lifespans. For example, the Koryo dynasty (915-1392 AD), with its capital in Kaesong, and the Chosen dynasty , with its capital in Seoul, lasted for 477 and 518 years, respectively, and could have been even longer had the two dynasties not been invaded by external forces. By contrast, the unified Shilla dynasty (668-915 AD), with its capital in Kyongju, only lasted for 247 years, which is less than that of the Koryo, and even less than half that of the Chosen. It is reasonable to believe that it was the disadvantageous (southeast coastal) location of the capital that made the Shilla court gradually lose efficient control over the northern peripheries and eventually the whole country as well.",

They include such important problem as: Why were China's political centers usually located at the geographical peripheries during its prosperous periods, and located at the geographical centers during its stagnant periods? Besides, why have various forms of economic integrations existed between Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and mainland China, while cultural and economic separations existed between China's western, less developed provincial administrations? The geographical location of capital cities and the territorial size of the Chinese nation have mattered very much to the dynastic changes in the Chinese history, as shown in Figure 15 .5.",

When people arrived in Dazexaing (in southwest of today's Suxian county, Anhui province), due to heavy rain, the roads were damaged and their trip to the destination was delayed. According to the Qin's penal code, those in military service would be executed if they failed to keep their appointments, so these people faced the threat of death. Since Chen Sheng and Wu Guang had long been dissatisfied with their poverty-stricken life, and now faced the treats of death, they decided to initiate an uprising to 'save' themselves. Soon, many people joined (including Xiang Yu and Liu Bang) and the uprising spread across the country. They led the peasants to attack and occupy finally Chen County (today's Huaiyang in Henan province), and they established their own regime entitled Zhangchu.
