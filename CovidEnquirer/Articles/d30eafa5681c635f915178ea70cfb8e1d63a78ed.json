At its simplest the need to buy and sell across borders is motivated by the fact that no country is entirely self-sufficient. Increased business activity and growth has stimulated increased demand for goods, services and factors of production. In the event that such commodities cannot be satisfied from within national borders, foreign suppliers are sought to meet the demand.",

Since the industrial revolution in the late eighteenth century, the pace of change has accelerated as new technologies have been developed. Whereas previously the fastest method of reliable communication was the galloping horse, information travelling at the speed of light can now circulate the earth several times in less than 1 second. Furthermore, in addition to the enormous speeding up of communications, an unprecedented number of people all over the world now have access to channels of advanced means of communication. Communications can thus reach many more people than ever before at almost instantaneous speed. The changes in communications technology have been so marked that the term the 'communications revolution' has been coined to describe it.",

The growth and improvements in motorcar technology has signalled a huge growth in independent transport whilst the construction of fast motorway systems has made transport by road faster and safer. However, increasing volumes of traffic with consequent time-consuming congestion have stimulated a trend in the transferral of freight haulage from the roads to the rail network. The rapid loading and unloading of ships together with electronic inventory management in shipping services have increased the usefulness of shipping as a means of goods passage between countries. Airline activity has continued to grow at a fast rate, with the revenue of \u00a313.5 billion generated by UK airlines in 2003. This demonstrated a rise of 6.3% over the previous year and indicated a positive upward trend following the global reduction in long-haul air travel between 2001 and 2003, in the aftermath of 11th September 2001. Also, during that period, the long-haul, business travel oriented airlines experienced significant reductions in business as a result of effects of the outbreak of foot-andmouth disease in the UK and the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in Asia. Meanwhile the short-haul leisure market continued to expand, driven by the dramatic rise and consolidation in the low-cost airline sector. Growth of the low-cost airlines has been greatly facilitated by penetration of Internet bookings, albeit to the detriment of seatonly charter flights. It is estimated that between 2004 and 2008, the number of UK passengers travelling both into and out of the UK will increase by 13.3%, 1 although that estimated may have to be revised downwards if aviation fuel prices continue to rise and affect the cost of travel.",

It is argued that everybody wants the same global brands, such as Levi jeans, Marlboro, Coca Cola and McDonald's. Whilst in some countries, the desire for a brand may be due to the fact that it has some status attached to it (such as Western clothes brands in the Third World), in other cases, everybody wants a certain product simply because it is the best available. A company producing a product which is demanded in many or even all parts of the world (i.e. for which demand is homogenised) will have an obvious incentive to internationalise in order to take full advantage of the global demand.",

The product life cycle, which is described in more detail in Chapter 28, says that all products are subject to growth, maturity and eventually decline. It may be the case that a product entering maturity in one country (thus stopping the growth the company has previously enjoyed), can be offset by growth in hitherto untapped foreign markets. In some cases, the domestic market will reach maturity because 'everybody who wants one has got one', whereas for other products, there may be a trend away from buying a certain type of product (e.g. tobacco products). \u25a0 Increased regulation in the domestic market. Governments that impose 'excessive' regulation (which is a matter of perspective) on businesses will tend, overall, to encourage businesses to seek to invest in areas where regulation is less. Regulation of business, for example, by imposing employment laws, health and safety rules, etc. invariably entails cost increases, so it is in some business's interests to seek to expand in countries where regulation is less strict. The 'opt-out' that the UK negotiated from the social charter of the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 means that UK labour is in some ways less regulated than most other EU states and this reduced the incentive for some companies to seek to internationalise away from the UK (see also Chapter 8).",

Companies may look abroad to invest if they suspect that the skills of the local labour force will not be adequate over the longer term. \u25a0 High fiscal pressure may encourage a business to seek international expansion if it must pay what it considers to be excessive taxes in a domestic economy.

The use of foreign agents or distributors usually frees the exporter of such responsibilities. \u25a0 The exporter's risk is limited to the value of the shipment. Compared to direct investment, when a great deal of investment may be at risk by changes in the foreign country's environment, exporting can be an attractive option. \u25a0 The fact that little or no set-up cost is involved in exporting means that an organisation can attack several foreign markets within a limited budget.

This problem is exacerbated when the distance is great or when the goods are of a fragile or perishable nature. The costs of transport and insurance can also add costs to exports that can render them price uncompetitive compared to domestic products in the foreign country. \u25a0 Collecting due payment can be a problem when the customer is in a different country. Legal complications can sometimes result if customers default on payment or if payment is late. Legal instruments are usually put in place using a bank in the importer's country to minimise the risks of non or late payment. \u25a0 Exported goods, when entering foreign countries, are sometimes subject to tariff charges or other restrictions. Payment of taxes to a host government by the importer has obvious implications for pricing whilst some goods are subject to limitations on the quantities imported. Such protectionist measures mean that exporters have many more factors to consider in exporting than if they were to restrict their activities to domestic business only. \u25a0 The number of foreign interests that an exporter has means that the company must be aware of the business environments of more countries than just its own. Changes in the internal environment of a country with which the organisation does business can affect the performance of the company. An exporter has an interest in the political, economical and sociological environments of all of the countries it exports to. This significantly complicates the operation of an exporter's business (although this can said to be a drawback of most entry strategies -not just exporting).",

When we examined the concept of franchise in Chapter 5, we saw that it was a way that a business with a transferable business idea can expand by renting the right to use the idea to a franchisee. Expansion by franchise is thus an expansion option which offers the franchisor the opportunity to gain income at little or no extra investment or risk to himself. Since moving to foreign markets inevitably contains an element of risk which may not be so marked if expansion were to be restricted to the domestic market, some companies have opted for international franchising as a means of internationalisation.

Traditionally, national governments have had something of a 'love-hate' relationship with some of the world's major MNCs. Clearly, they can be of enormous benefit to the countries in which they operate in their provision of jobs, their payment of tax revenues and their contribution to GDP, exports, etc. Similarly, their size and their importance to a country can mean that they also have significant influence upon governments. Critics argue that not only is excessive business influence upon government anti-democratic (because it is the government and not large businesses which are elected to govern), but also that such influence is usually representative of certain economic opinions only.",

Accompanying this expansion is a change in its corporate culture when the business loses its national bias. In other words, it no longer 'feels like' a Japanese company or a British company -its breadth means that it feels like and is seen as a global business. A global company's head office (e.g. in London) does not see the business as divided into 'home' and 'overseas', but as one company of many parts encompassing the world.",

The dispute centred on US complaints that concessions offered by the EU to African, Caribbean and Pacific banana exporters harmed the interests of US multinationals that grow bananas in Latin America. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) (see below) upheld the US position, on two occasions, and called upon the EU authorities to change their importing procedures. However, in the absence of any alterations acceptable to the US, the Clinton administration in 1999 (with WTO approval) imposed sanctions on a range of EU products worth $191.4 million. The dispute threatened to undermine the dispute settlement authority of the WTO until agreement was finally reached in April 2001. The agreement paved the way for the implementation of an EU importing system for bananas by 2006, based upon a WTO-compatible tariff-only. Under the terms of the agreement the EU would continue to import bananas, during the transition period, based on historic reference periods measuring previous export patterns from producer countries and the USA would suspend its sanctions on July 1, 2001 . Part II From time to time sanctions or embargoes are designed to achieve political rather than business objectives. In some cases, they are imposed as a means of punishment whilst in others, it is hoped that the sanctions will precipitate a change in certain political practices (such as the cessation of the alleged development of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or an end to human rights abuses).
