This vaccine candidate was highly attenuated in mice with deficiencies in the B and T cell compartments, as well as in mice with deficient gammainterferon responsiveness. However, the level of protection varied among the strains tested. Wild type mice were protected against lethal VEEV challenge. In contrast, alpha/beta (\u03b1\u03b2) TCR-deficient mice developed lethal encephalitis following VEEV challenge, while mice deficient in gamma/delta (\u03b3\u03b4) T cells were protected. Surprisingly, the vaccine potency was diminished by 50% in animals lacking interferon-gamma receptor alpha chain (R1)-chain and a minority of vaccinated immunoglobulin heavy chain-deficient (\u03bcMT) mice survived challenge, which suggests that neutralizing antibody may not be absolutely required for protection. Prolonged replication of encephalitic VEEV in the brain of pre-immunized mice is not lethal and adoptive transfer experiments indicate that CD3 + T cells are required for protection.",

During the most recent outbreak in South America in 1983, approximately 100,000 human cases of infection were reported with over 300 clinical cases diagnosed (Weaver et al., 2004) . The case-fatality rate in equine species is relatively high and can reach levels exceeding 80%, primarily due to the spread of infection to the CNS, which results in encephalitis. In humans, mortality rates are relatively low (b 1%), but clinical signs of neurological disease are prevalent, especially in children (de la Monte et al., 1985; Weaver et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "Various animal models have been used to examine the distinct phases of infection, including the development of VEEVinduced encephalitis. Both hamster and mouse models have been used to understand the pathogenesis of the virus and the host immune response as well as to evaluate vaccines (Charles et Virology 367 (2007) 307 -323 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro al., 1995; Ryzhikov et al., 1991 Ryzhikov et al., , 1995 . Infection in the mouse by a peripheral route of challenge exposure (subcutaneous) results in a biphasic disease pattern, in which the virus initially replicates in lymphoid tissue and ultimately progresses into the CNS (Anishchenko et al., 2006; Paessler et al., 2003 Paessler et al., , 2006b , while intranasal and intracranial challenge results in earlier CNS penetration. Once CNS infection is established in na\u00efve animals, acute meningoencephalitis with neuronal cell death follows, which is uniformly fatal (Charles et al., 1995; Ryzhikov et al., 1991 Ryzhikov et al., , 1995 . Infection in the brain is associated with the development of an inflammatory response in the immunocompetent host, with perivascular and vascular infiltration of mononuclear cells, edema and micro-hemorrhages. The pathology associated with infection is disseminated throughout the brain, with the exception of a more prominent focal response in the cortex. Immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of viral antigen in the CNS indicates staining in neurons and in the neuropil, as well as in astrocytes (Anishchenko et al., 2006; Paessler et al., 2006b) . VEEV is a potential biothreat agent; thus, vaccines to limit infection and/or fatal encephalitis are currently under development using a variety of approaches (Charles et al., 1997; Davis et al., 1995; Paessler et al., 2006b) . The live attenuated vaccine strain, TC-83, was developed over four decades ago by serial passaging of the Trinidad Donkey (TrD) VEEV strain in guinea pig myocytes and remains the only available vaccine for humans. However, residual pathogenicity has been a concern with this strain (Anishchenko et al., 2006; Jahrling and Scherer, 1973; Paessler et al., 2006b) . Recent new generation live-attenuated vaccines that incorporate the use of alphavirus vectors to express VEEV proteins have been shown to be both safe and effective in protecting mice and hamsters from lethal disease (Paessler et al., 2003 (Paessler et al., , 2006a . Using a relatively rigorous challenge with the VEEV ZPC738 strain via the intracerebral or intranasal routes, mice were protected from lethal encephalitis following vaccination. Vaccinated mice did not develop any overt signs of disease and had reduced levels of viral replication. Moreover, vaccinated NIH Swiss (outbred) mice developed a strong anti-VEEV neuroinflammatory response upon challenge with wild type virus and had high titers of serum-neutralizing antibody (Paessler et al., 2003 (Paessler et al., , 2006a . Despite the initial characterization of these responses in vaccinated mice protected from a challenge dose that would be uniformly lethal in unvaccinated animals, the precise basis of the adaptive immune response stimulated by the Sindbis/VEEV chimera that ultimately leads to this protection has not been fully characterized.",

Alpha-beta (\u03b1\u03b2) T cells represent the majority of peptide-specific T cells, whereas \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have been hypothesized to form a link between innate and adaptive immunity; however, many of the functions of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are unknown, particularly in the central nervous system (Born et al., 2006) . Protection from lethal encephalitis was dependent on the presence of \u03b1\u03b2 T cell receptor (TCR)-bearing (CD3 + ) cells, but not on \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-bearing cells. Remarkably, \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-deficient mice were protected from lethal viral challenge by intranasal inoculation with VEEV but a continued persistence of variants of the ZPC738 challenge strain was found up to 28 days following challenge. Our data unambiguously demonstrate distinct roles for murine \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the vaccine and challenge response to neurovirulent VEEV.",

Vaccination: eleven to 18-week-old, female mice were inoculated on day 0 and day 34 subcutaneously into the medial thigh with the chimeric SIN/ ZPC virus at a dose of 5 \u00d7 10 5 plaque forming units in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl. Mock-vaccinated mice (indicated as \"WT* unvacc\") were inoculated subcutaneously with 100 \u03bcl of PBS. Virus challenge: SIN/ZPC or mock-vaccinated mice were inoculated on day 0 intranasally with an identical dose of virulent VEEV (ZPC738) in 40 \u03bcl of PBS and deaths were recorded. Daily telemetric monitoring of body temperature was performed for a total period of 14 days, beginning 2 days prior to the first vaccination on day 0.

This result suggests that the primary protective cell type elicited by vaccination with the chimeric SIN/ZPC experimental vaccine resides within the CD3 + \u03b1\u03b2 T cell population.",

            "text": "IFN-\u03b3 is an essential switch factor for IgG2a and it is anticipated that the IgG isotype is predominantly induced as a result of vaccination with the Sindbis/VEEV chimera (Snapper and Paul, 1987) . Prior studies in VSV have shown that neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 reduces neutralizing IgG antibodies (Maloy et al., 1998) . In this same series of studies, \u03b1\u03b2 TCR-deficient mice produced IgG neutralizing antibodies as a result of compensation from \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-derived IFN-\u03b3. A similar mechanism may be initiated in response to VEEV in the CNS and could account for the reduction in neutralizing antibody in both \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-deficient mice and IFN\u03b3R-deficient mice. A minor proportion of \u03bcMT mice survived infection following vaccination whereas vaccinated \u03b1\u03b2 TCR-deficient mice uniformly died. Adoptive transfer of CD4 + T cells from vaccinated WT donor mice results in reconstitution of protection in \u03b1\u03b2 TCR-deficient mice, suggesting a predominant role for this cell type (S. Paessler, unpublished observations). This study does not address the role of non-neutralizing antibodies that may be produced as a result of vaccination and/or viral challenge. Previously, it has been shown that the prophylactic, passive transfer of non-neutralizing, monoclonal antibody into animals infected with neuroadapted Sindbis virus, which causes encephalitis under experimental conditions, can prolong survival or protect mice completely (Schmaljohn et al., 1982) . However, the efficacy of different non-neutralizing antibody described by Schmaljohn et al. correlated with the attenuation of CNS infection that was reflected by dramatically (100-fold to a million-fold) reduced viral titers in the brains of infected and treated mice in comparison to infected, but untreated mice. This led to the hypothesis that host cell infection was blocked via either of two alternative mechanisms: (i) antibody-dependent cytolysis of infected cells, or (ii) hindrance of virus budding from infected cells by binding to the viral proteins embedded in the membranes of infected cells (Schmaljohn et al., 1982) . Similar to results from experimental work with Sindbis virus, Hunt et al. have demonstrated the protection of non-neutralizing antibody to the amino terminus of E2 of Trinidad Donkey strain of VEEV, which was based on its ability to limit virus replication in the brains of infected mice, and, thereby, reducing the viral load in the brain (Hunt et al., 1990 (Hunt et al., , 1991 . In our evaluation of the brains in this study, the viral loads are reduced only in vaccinated WT mice, while other strains with selective immune deficiencies are equally susceptible to VEEV replication in the brain, regardless of the outcome of infection. Based on our data, in which seroconversion was measured pre-and post-challenge, we believe that the humoral immune response was highly limited in mice with selective immune deficiencies, while it was robust in WT mice. Nevertheless, we can only speculate about the importance of non-neutralizing antibody in our model and subsequent studies may be needed to address this issue.",

The characteristics of parental C57BL/6 mice (wild type, WT) and immunodeficient mice are described in Materials and methods (Table 1) brains of animals that survived 28 days after infection. Our data demonstrate distinct differences in the vaccine and challenge (adaptive) response to neurovirulent VEEV in \u03b1\u03b2 vs. \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell deficient mice. Thus, while \u03b1\u03b2 TCR-bearing T cells appear to be strictly required for protection, \u03b3\u03b4 TCRbearing T cells may not; it is possible that persistence is an indirect effect of a deficit in T cell help for B cells in the latter mice. Future studies will examine the cell types that are responsible for protection. The role of cytolytic CD8 + T cells in the response to VEEV infection has not been clearly defined, as previous studies demonstrated a significant degree of variability, depending upon the virus and/or mouse strain tested (Jones et al., 2003) . As neurons are not highly proliferative and are not believed to regenerate, the mechanism of viral elimination by neurons remains under intensive study, with focus on non-lytic and lytic mechanisms of viral clearance. As CD4 + and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have been shown to perform redundant functions, the extent of their involvement in the immune response may be highly dependent upon which cell type is recruited to sites of viral replication in the CNS and the periphery.

Infectious virus persisted in the brain, despite a moderate level of inflammation and cellular infiltration at the site of infection, which was observed in histopathological evaluation of brain tissues. The persistence of infectious VEEV has not heretofore been described, although viral RNA has been detected in the brains of mice that survived acute Sindbis virus infection (Levine and Griffin, 1992) . The nature of persistence of VEEV in these \u03b3\u03b4 T cell deficient mice, which occurs in the absence of clinical disease, is an interesting finding that warrants further molecular pathogenesis studies. These results suggest the potential for a novel role for \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the CNS. TCR \u03b1\u03b2-deficiency has been shown to impact \u03b3\u03b4 T cell development (Pennington et al., 2003) . However, in our studies, \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-deficient mice survive a lethal VEEV challenge dose.",

            "text": "In general, \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-deficient mice have increased susceptibility to tumors and exaggerated immunopathology in bacterial infection models Mukasa et al., 1995) . Functionally, IFN-\u03b3 producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have been shown to play a role in the production of neutralizing antibody responses in TCR\u03b1-and TCR\u03b2-deficient mice to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Maloy et al., 1998) . In response to vaccination and challenge with VEEV, the majority of \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-deficient mice did not mount detectable neutralizing antibody responses. The immunoregulatory potential of \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-bearing cells is diverse with the potential to regulate cellular infiltration and retention at sites of inflammation, positively or negatively regulate effector T cell function including cytotoxicity, directly lyse antigenpresenting cells and block the influx of neutrophils . Further, in experimental models of autoimmune encephalomyelitis, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have been shown to promote downmodulation of the inflammatory response by inducing turnover of encephalitogenic T cells via a CD95L-dependent mechanism (Ponomarev and Dittel, 2005) . Interestingly, this regulation appears to occur late in the disease process and may involve cross-talk with \u03b1\u03b2 TCR-bearing cells. The precise basis of the specific host-pathogen-interaction(s) responsible for clearance of infectious virus or for selection of viral variants is unclear, but occurs in a microenvironment of a more extensive inflammatory and necrotic response in this particular model. These results are in contrast to previously published role for \u03b1\u03b2 TCR-bearing T cells in the encephalitic Sindbis virus model. Animals deficient in \u03b1\u03b2, but not \u03b3\u03b4 T cells had lower mortality rates when infected with neuroadapted Sindbis virus, indicating different contributions to the outcome of the brain infection (Rowell and Griffin, 2002) . Recent studies for orthopox virus infections have shown a key role for \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-derived IFN-\u03b3 in innate immunity to infection . In coronavirus infection, human V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells display an interferon\u03b3-dependent anti-SARS-CoV activity and are able to directly kill SARS-CoV-infected target cells . Gamma-delta T cells also mediate demyelination in athymic mice infected with the neurotropic coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (Dandekar et al., 2005) . This process has been shown to be dependent on IFN-\u03b3 production. These results contrast with alphavirus-mediated immunity to VEEV, which appears to be partially independent of IFN-\u03b3R signaling and partially independent of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in early antiviral response.",
