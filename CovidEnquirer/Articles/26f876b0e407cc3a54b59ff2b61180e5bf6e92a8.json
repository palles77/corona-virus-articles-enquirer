Respiratory rate (RR) is defined as the number of breaths per minute. A typical goal of respiratory rate measurement is to evaluate whether the respirations are normal, too fast (tachypnea), too slow (bradypnea), or nonexistent (apnea). Apnea is defined by the cessation of respiratory airflow and is especially dangerous during sleep. The length of time necessary to qualify a true apneic event (i.e., considered clinically significant in sleep apnea syndromes) is measured in seconds [1] , e.g., >10 s for central sleep apnea syndrome [2] . The threshold values for sleep apnea syndromes are defined as a result of cumulative clinical experience and are different for adults (e.g., >9 s [3] or >10 s [2] ) and children (>19 s [1] ). In this paper, the term ''apnea'' is used in wide sense, i.e., as a ''cessation of respiration airflow''.",

In [7] , the authors specified many recommendations for measurement of RR in hospitals and in admission to intensive care units, including ''the respiratory rate should be measured and documented accurately in all hospital patients at least once a day, and should always be documented when other vital signs are measured''.

For example, in [27] , the authors presented a particle filter tracker driven by a probabilistic template function, which is capable of adapting to abrupt positional and physiological changes. First, the user manually inputs the initial template (rectangular ROI) in the first frame (using the computer mouse). For the following frames, the method automatically performs the template updating process by first extracting stable and unstable seeds and subsequently computing the spatiotemporal fuzzy mask. The method was tested on a dataset consisting of 25 thermal sequences for various conditions (e.g., movements of subjects). The method demonstrated robustness and accuracy in thermal facial imaging.

            "text": "The miniaturization of thermal imaging sensors (e.g., TAMARISK cameras, Flir Lepton sensors) allows embedding of such sensors in mobile portable devices, e.g., in smart glasses. In recent years, many smart glasses have been proposed, including Google Glass, Epson Moverio BT-200, and so on, and many applications of smart glasses in healthcare have been presented. For example, Evena Medical reported the use of smart glasses to improve visualization of skin veins with IR illumination [31] . Under the eGlasses project (www.eglasses.eu), our group is developing a smart glasses platform that can use different sensors, including visible and thermal cameras [32, 33] . The user of these dedicated smart glasses can identify a person (e.g., using graphical markers [34] or facial features [33] ), attempt to estimate vital sign parameters (using a thermal camera, visual camera, etc.) and store the information in a healthcare information system. Therefore, it is important to analyze the reliability of the RR estimation for short image sequences recorded using a mobile thermal camera. Additionally, the goal of the work reported in this paper is to analyze the types of respiration patterns that can be accurately evaluated and described using such mobile system. In particular, three parameters of respiration patterns are evaluated: the respiration rate for normal and abnormal breathing patterns, the presence of breathing pauses or apnea events (cessation of respiration) and the relationship between respiration effort and respiration activity (respiration depth). A potential practical application is remote monitoring of respiration rate and patterns during screening activities or during classical interviews with patients.",

A portable thermal camera (that can be easily connected to smart glasses frame; see Fig. 2a ) was fixed using a special handle mounted on a table and positioned collinear to the subject's face. Each subject was asked to sit in an armchair (fixed position) in front of the camera. Using the camera preview mode, the position of each subject was fixed to fulfill the following conditions: nostrils visible and nose within approximately 1/5 of the frame width. This condition was one of the assumptions of this study. Because the subjects were different, the distance between the camera face and subject's face was in the range of 40-70 cm. Such distances could be easily used in practice, e.g., at the beginning of every routine medical examination when the nurse takes the patient's vital signs. For each subject, the session was divided into three phases: (1) subject sitting on the armchair with position fixed as described above, (2) subject asked to rest (calmly) for several seconds, and (3) subject asked to performed breathing exercises, which were different for both experiments, each for 1 min. During the last phase (3rd), thermal video sequences were recorded together with the reference measurements of respiration activities collected using a pressure belt (Vernier RMB). The sampling frequency for both devices (belt and thermal camera) was set to 25 Hz. To synchronize both respiration signals, subjects were asked to hold a breath and begin normal breathing after the acquisition was started. Each data acquisition phase lasted 1 min (1-min recordings; see Fig. 2b ).",

This approach assumes that the respiration frequency f SP is the frequency value for the highest peak in the frequency spectrum (e.g., amplitude spectrum) and also assumes (as in other methods) that the respiration signal is dominant in the analyzed signal. This method has two disadvantages. First, for short signals, this method has a low frequency resolution (e.g., for T = 30 s, N = 750, f s = 25 Hz, the spectral resolution is (25/750) \u00c2 60, i.e., approximately 2 bpm). Second, this method almost always returns a result, even for noise signals, and thus ''false'' respiration rate values could be returned for the filtered signals. Therefore, additional respiration rate estimators were investigated, i.e., eRR_ac is an estimator based on periodicity of peak locations for the autocorrelation function in the time domain, eRR_zc is the estimator based on the number of zero-crossings, and eRR_pk is the estimator based on the number of detected peaks.",

Based on prior knowledge, it can be assumed that the filtered (smoothed) regular respiratory signal resembles a sine function, i.e., the result of periodical inhalation/exhalation activities. Based on the previous results obtained for pulse rate analysis in videoplethysmography, two signal parameters defined using spectral moments have been found to be valuable: the ''complexity'' measure (Hijorth parameter) and the ''spectral purity index''. Both of these signal parameters can be efficiently calculated in the time domain. If the signal is more similar to the sine signal, the ''complexity'' parameter has lower values (\u22650), whereas the SPI parameter has higher values (\u22651). Theoretically, the sine-like periodicity of the signal can be represented by simple parameters.",

During the experiments, volunteers were asked to hold their breath to simulate apnea periods in the P1, P2, P4, and P5 patterns. However, the volunteers could decide when to hold the breath (e.g., at the beginning of next inspiration event or expiration event or in the middle) and how long the apnea event should last. The problem is that for thermal recordings of apnea periods, the temperature inside the analyzed ROI slowly changes due to many internal (e.g., blood flow) and external (heat flow due to ambient temperature changes) thermal conditions. This change can be positive (trend with positive slope), negative (trend with negative slope) or neutral (without a slope, normalized mean near 0). However, the rate of change is typically smaller than that of the respiration rate. Additionally, the observed temperature gradient is also significantly smaller than that of respiration activity. Therefore, the apnea event detection algorithm (Algorithm 1) was proposed based on the first derivative of the filtered signal. The absolute values of the first derivative signal are normalized in reference to the maximum signal value. The algorithm counts all successive samples for which the values are smaller than the threshold value. The threshold value is calculated as the weighted (K) value of the interquartile range (IQR) for the processed signal. An apnea event is detected if the number of samples (or time after scaling using the sampling frequency value f s ) is greater than the assumed parameter value Tapnea (e.g., >10 s). Finally, the relative amplitude values of respiration signals were analyzed. The change in amplitudes for the respiration waveforms recorded with the reference belt and the thermal camera was investigated. The amplitudes were compared using a qualitative method with comparison of the signal plots in the time domain. Table 1 presents the results obtained from all investigated respiration rate estimators for thermal-based respiration signals and for the reference signals recorded using the pressure belt. Table 2 presents the mean square error (MSE), the mean and standard deviation of the absolute differences between the respiration rate estimated using the given estimator for thermal-based respiratory signals and the manually calculated respiration rate (for belt-based signals).

Four RR estimators were investigated. The best results were obtained for the estimator based on the periodicity of the autocorrelation as a function of time lags (eRR_ac). A slightly worse accuracy was obtained for the eRR_pk and eRR_sp estimators. The mean differences between the estimated values and reference values were small even for the estimator based on zero-crossing counting. It can be concluded that it is possible to reliably estimate the respiration rate from shorttime thermal sequences acquired for faces. Similar studies were previously presented for an estimator based on frequency detection for the maximum peak in the amplitude or PSD spectrum after FFT transform [21] or with classification of frames [22] . However, it was proved in this study that other estimators might produce notably good or even better results. It was also shown that the introduction of signal descriptors that represent the ''periodicity'' of the signal could aid in differentiation between highly periodical signals (potential respiration waveforms) and other signals (background signals). This approach could be important in automatic evaluation of source ROIs that contain respiration-related information during data acquisition using a thermal camera mounted on smart glasses. In such cases, the face in the thermal image should be automatically detected (e.g., [37, 38] ) as well as the nose or mouth ROIs. The dominant frequency of the signal can be detected for almost all signals and also for signals that are not respiration waveforms. Therefore, additional measures such as ''complexity'' or SPI can be used to aid in differentiation between less or more probable respiration signals or to describe the periodicity of the respiration waveforms.",

First, it was demonstrated that it is possible to reliably detect apnea periods from thermal-based signals using a relatively simple and fast algorithm. It is also possible to reliably estimate the respiration rate for signals that contain apnea periods. For example, the spectrograms presented in Fig. 6 show highly similar time-frequency characteristics between thermalbased signals and reference signals. However, in the presence of apnea events, the investigated RR estimators produce different results, which is highly related to the definitions of the estimators. The respiration rate is defined as the number of respiration events in a given time window. Therefore, in the presence of apnea events, the estimated respiration rate values should be and were observed to be higher (in reference to the RR definition) for the estimators based on dominant frequencies (eRR_ac, eRR_sp). The methods based on signal changes in the time domain, such as eRR_pk, produced more reliable results. However, different values of the respiration rates estimated using either the dominant frequency or the number of respiration events in the time domain could be used as an additional measure for discrimination between respiration patterns with apnea periods or without apnea. In the absence of apnea events, such estimators should produce similar values (e.g., eRR_ac and eRR_pk). If the values of both estimators are significantly different, the algorithm for detection of apnea periods could be used to verify the presence of cessation of respiratory airflow.",
