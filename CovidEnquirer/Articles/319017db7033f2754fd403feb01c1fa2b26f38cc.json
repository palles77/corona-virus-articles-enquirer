The anonymous opinions of all members of the group are collected using a formal questionnaire or graph. However, discussion is only permitted after the last round of voting, because opinion leaders might otherwise sway their colleagues' assessments.

The results of the first round were shared in a plenary session by showing the median of the start Figure 1 Contact tracing-risk assessment profile tuberculosis. and end points for each value on the bipolar scales. The application of the Delphi method requires that each round is followed by controlled group feedback. Contributions remained anonymous at all times.

This new approach aims to semiquantitatively translate evidence of variable strength and on diverse conditions into a graphical risk assessment tool. We intentionally derived our approach from an assessment tool that is well established in the social sciences to display different characteristics, which in its sum will give a pictorial and semiquantitative impression through an overall profile. Although our application is based on biological and epidemiological criteria, the challenge is similar to that used in social sciences since the outcome of one measurement alone will not force, like in many dichotomous structures, a decision but will allows it to weigh in other factors. It is rather a combination of conditions which characterise a specific situation that may lead the decision towards a certain direction. A numerical computation of individual scores could also cope with the combination of different criteria, but it tends to suggest a precision not supported by the available evidence. Thus, the visual impression resulting from the connecting lines between the ticked values of the epidemiological criteria is likely to give enough of a tendency to quickly support decision-making while leaving enough room for the decision-makers to take other important issues into account. In addition, the disease-specific epidemiological criteria of the CT-RAP can, in combination with the fact sheet, be employed as a checklist of decisive parameters.",

An attempt to give a semiquantitative account of the degree Figure 4 Contact tracing-risk assessment profile: meningococcal disease (applied). Instructions to the user: Both the contact tracing-risk assessment profile (CT-RAP) on tuberculosis and the CT-RAP on meningococcal disease start with a dichotomous decision step. If necessary, the user may proceed with the bipolar scale component: the two endpoints of the bipolar scales represent a high (on the right-hand side) or a low (on the left-hand side) indication of whether or not to start contact tracing. The values selected and ticked may cluster on either side of the neutral midline or around the midline according to the particular details of the situation. By drawing a line connecting selected values, an overall assessment is visualised (see figures 3 and 4). If most values in the CT-RAP cluster on the right end of the scale, the result can be interpreted as an indication to start the contact tracing process. In contrast, profiles with values marked predominantly on the left end of the scale show a low indication for contact tracing. If the CT-RAP values are predominantly positioned around the midline, a recommendation neither for nor against contact tracing may be deduced. The neutral position should also be chosen because lack of information does not allow the allocation of a value. of uncertainty, for example, by plotting CIs and means for each point estimate representing the experts' opinions, is of course the subject for discussion. Indicating the medians as well as the minimum and maximum point estimates would be an alternative approach. Both approaches have their advantages. Even the objective to give a semiquantitative account of the degree of uncertainty might be questioned. But we preferred to show the degree of uncertainty inherent in each decisive criterion by displaying the range of values through whiskers (median of the highest and lowest rankings of aggregated experts' opinions). Considering that some criteria have a lesser degree of uncertainty than others and that some users might not consider the degree of uncertainty at all, we believe our approach is more suitable.",

Instructions to the user: Both the contact tracing-risk assessment profile (CT-RAP) on tuberculosis and the CT-RAP on meningococcal disease start with a dichotomous decision step. If necessary, the user may proceed with the bipolar scale component: the two endpoints of the bipolar scales represent a high (on the right-hand side) or a low (on the left-hand side) indication of whether or not to start contact tracing. The values selected and ticked may cluster on either side of the neutral midline or around the midline according to the particular details of the situation. By drawing a line connecting selected values, an overall assessment is visualised (see figures 3 and 4). If most values in the CT-RAP cluster on the right end of the scale, the result can be interpreted as an indication to start the contact tracing process. In contrast, profiles with values marked predominantly on the left end of the scale show a low indication for contact tracing. If the CT-RAP values are predominantly positioned around the midline, a recommendation neither for nor against contact tracing may be deduced. The neutral position should also be chosen because lack of information does not allow the allocation of a value.",

For meningococcal disease, the dichotomous decision step preceding the bipolar scale component of the CT-RAP addresses the time span elapsed since exposure. Only if this time span is equal to or less than 10 days can the user continue with the bipolar scale component displaying seven epidemiological criteria with each having two to four different values (figure 2). The background information of the CT-RAP for meningococcal disease consists of a summary of the scientific literature of 17 peer-reviewed publications in international journals and 17 guidance documents (including recommendations and position papers; see online supplementary Annex 2 'Meningococcal disease').
