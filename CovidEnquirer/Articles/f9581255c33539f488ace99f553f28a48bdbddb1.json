With the determined 183 translation probabilities and amino-acid composition of eight highly mutated proteins, we construct the theoretical distributions of mutated amino acids in these proteins and then compare them with their actual distributions affected by mutations. Thereafter we trace the pattern of translation probabilities from RNA codons to mutated amino acids of 1053 point missense mutations. Finally, we statistically conclude that the natural mutation trend goes along the theoretical translation probability.",

Translation of the genetic code requires attachment of tRNAs to their cognate amino acids, and the editing by phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase is essential for faithful translation of the genetic code [2] . Translation could be enhanced by increasing the rate of elongation, reducing the cost of proofreading [3, 4] , increasing the accuracy of translation [5] [6] [7] , or by any combination of those mechanisms [8] . Also protein charge heterogeneity [9] and protein release factors [10] can influence the translation of mRNAs.",

Between RNA and protein, the RNA codes have the unambiguous relationship with their translated amino acids, for example, any of four RNA codons ACU, ACC, ACA, and ACG can be translated to the amino acid threonine. Between DNA and RNA, a single-base change in DNA nucleotide leads to the corresponding change in the RNA code. For instance, the RNA codon ACU can be changed to ACC, ACA, ACG, AUU, AAU, AGU, UCU, CCU, and GCU due to a single-base change in DNA, if we do not consider the possibility that U changes to U in the RNA codon ACU. As a result, each change in RNA code will be translated to different amino acids (Table 1 ).

As can be seen in Table 2 , threonine can be mutated to eight different amino acids with different translation probabilities if we do not calculate the probabilities that ''U'' changes to ''U'', ''A'' changes to ''A,'' ''C'' changes to ''C'', and ''G'' changes to ''G.''

(ii) There is no actual distribution for STOP codon, which is certainly due to the fact that the premature termination results in a synthesis of deleterious truncated proteins. (iii) Some actual distributions of mutated amino acids are very similar to the theoretical distributions such as isoleucine and threonine in human p53 protein, which at least means that the mutations would not lead to the dysfunction of human p53 proteins if the mutated amino acids would be these types. (iv) Some actual distributions of mutated amino acids are very different from the theoretical distribution such as alanine and arginine in human p53 protein.

The relationships between synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates and between synonymous rate and codon usage bias are important to our understanding of the roles of mutation and selection in the evolutionary process [27] . Synonymous codons differ in their capacity to minimize the effects of errors due to mutation or mistranslation. Natural selection for error minimization at the protein level plays a role in the evolution of coding sequences in Drosophila and rodents [28] . At least 10% of variation in codon bias can be explained by mutation pressure [29] . Furthermore, the effect of selection on individual codons changes over time [30] . The selection pressure is for reduced protein synthesis cost, say, most reassignments give amino acids that are less expensive to synthesize. Mitochondrial genetic codes evolve to match the amino-acid requirements of proteins [31] .",
