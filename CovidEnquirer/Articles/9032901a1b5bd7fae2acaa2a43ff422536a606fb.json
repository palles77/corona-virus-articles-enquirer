PED is characterized by watery diarrhea, dehydration and weight loss in adult and lethal in piglets (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980; Pijpers et al., 1993) . Since the first report in England in the 1970s (Choudhury et al., 2016; Pensaert and Martelli, 2016) , PED has been reported in some countries (Pensaert et al., 1981; Takahashi et al., 1983) . In the 1980s, PEDV was first identified in China (Sun et al., 2018) . Until 2000, PEDV has been widely spread in 26 provinces in China, which made a largescale of economic losses in breeding industry. PED which is caused by variant PEDV, was re-emerged in China since October 2010 and caused devastating economic losses to the piggeries. The variant PEDV stains with five amino acids (aa) insertions at about 56-60 aa and one aa insertion at 141 aa of S protein comparing with CV777-based vaccines.",

It is spherical 80-220 nm in diameter, with envelope. And it also has 20 nm rodlike fiber and a symmetrical spiral nucleocapsid. The approximately 28 kb genome is an infectious, single-stranded, positivesense RNA, which 5\u2032 \u2192 3\u2032 is in the order of 5\u00b4UTR-Replicase-S-ORF3-E-M-N-3\u00b4UTR (Chen et al., 2013) . The transmembrane S glycoprotein takes an important part in virus binding, with receptors, fusing cells and neutralizing antibodies development (Lai et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2010) . S protein is implicated in virulence, which was found out in the other studies that S protein can be variant readily while receiving immune pressure (Gerber et al., 2014) . Classifying PEDV with S gene can help us to understand its evolution rule easier. Therefore, S protein is used to study the viral relationships between different areas. It is an effective tool in PED epidemiologic investigations, also as diagnostic identification to distinguish between wild strain and cells accommodation attenuated strain (Park et al., 2011) . In this study, PEDV CH/ JLDH/2016 variant strain was isolated and identified, phylogenetic relationship between domestic and globally emerging PEDV isolates were also studied. The results would be helpful to find out the reason of the continuously outbreaks of PEDV in China and provide more information about the origin, evolution and diversity of PEDVs. Based on these newly identified PEDV variants, the novel vaccines may contribute to the control of PED outbreaks.",

            "text": "PEDV has only a single serotype. As the difference between the amino acids of N-terminal domain in S gene, PEDV can be divided into two groups, G1 (G1a and G1b) group and G2 (G2a and G2b) group (Kocherhans et al., 2001) . Most of the PEDV in Europe and Asia were G1a strains before 2010, including classic strain and vaccine strain like CV777 and DR-1y231. In North America and Europe, G1a and G2b strain of gene U21a, which are also called S-IN DEL strain, were reported (Pensaert and Martelli, 2016) . The genetic characteristic of classic G1a strain was contained in S gene, which is similar to classic G1a strain and epidemic G2b strain that is also called non-S-IN DEL or epidemic strain (Puranaveja et al., 2009) . PED was outbroken in a large scale in Asia since 2010. As the article described, higher mortality in piglets of PED than before, which virus was mainly in PEDV G2b. After 2013, the PEDV G2b strain, which was similar to the PEDV strain prevalent in China since 2010, was spread to the pig breeding areas in the mid-western American. The PEDV G2b was spread across to America, then was spread to Canada and South America (Takahashi et al., 1983) . Coexisting with PEDV classic strain, the prevalent of PED is based on PEDV variant strain. To deal with the complex PED prevalent circumstance, we have S gene of our strain carried on sequence analysis. Results showed that PEDV variant strain was PEDV G2b strain.",

            "text": "It was first reported in Jilin province, China. In the early 1900s, CV777 vaccine strain were used widely through the pig breeding industry in China, that less PED cases were reported in a large scale. However, PED outbroke in some pig produced provinces in the late 2010. In the same time, the PEDV variant strain was first reported in China (Wen et al., 2018) . Moreover, the pigs that were inoculated vaccine CV777 still have a high mortality in the PED (caption on next page) T. Zhu, et al. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 71 (2019) 82-90 outbreaks. Since then, PED was continued to be reported in different areas in China. Significantly, the samples were collected from 15 provinces in China from 2012 to 2017, in a study, which in all strains, G1a, G1b, G2a and G2b clusters accounted for 1.9%, 9.6%, 32.2% and 56.3%, respectively, namely G2a and G2b were the two most prevalent clusters in China (Wen et al., 2018) . As the evidence showed that the PEDV strains of China have genetic diversity. In this study, the CH/JLDH/2016 strain belongs to the different branches with the vaccine strains and the earlier epidemic strains of China, that cause a far relative among them. While sharing the same branch with the recent epidemic strains, the CH/JLDH/2016 strain has a close relative with them. The reason PED still epidemically outbreaks in the immune pigs may be the differences between recent epidemic strains and earlier epidemic vaccine strains. Comparing to vaccine strain CV777, there are 15 nucleotides insertions and 9 deletions in the S gene of our strain which of a massive amout of bases variant, 3 epitopes (527-559aa, 604-645aa, 677-734aa) induced by neutralizing antibody were in S1 section. As a study suggests that the SS2 epitope (748 SNIGVCK 755 ) in S1 region of classic strains and variant strains is highly conservative rather amino acids mutate in SS6 epitope ( 764 QDGQVKI 771 ) and porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) receptor binding domain (490~615aa) (Wang et al., 2016b) . Our strain, in the SS2 epitope have no amino acid, variant while in SS6 epitope, Y changed into S in 776th amino acid, which have a homogeneity in the changes of amino acid of variant strain that reference presents. The epitope existence in conservative region and 7 amino acid mutants in pAPN receptor binding domain (aa490-615) in our strain that possesses the concordant result with CV777 vaccine in providing part of crossing immune protection for some epidemic PEDV strains in China. The changes of amino acids in the antigenic epitope may change the immunogenicity of the virus, which is in line with previous studies (Lin et al., 2016) . Based on these finding, we speculated that variant subtype G 2b PEDV may be circulating in pig herds of Northeast China.",

            "text": "It is confirmed that piglets could not get the immune protection from the commercial vaccine made by the classical strains CV777 and DR13. The attenuated CV777 strain belongs to the G1b subgroup, which is not genetically closely related with our variant strain. The CV777 vaccine strain failed to provide sufficient protection against the PEDV variants due to limited cross-protection, all of which have been reported in other studies (Li et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012; Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013 Wang et al., , 2014 Wang et al., , 2016a . While the inactivated antigen produced by the YC2014 strain could provide immune protection for piglets (Lin et al., 2016) , which can infer that the potential reason PED outbroke in some immune piggery are that bases inserted and deleted in S gene and the changes of neutralizing epitope amino acids. Our variants were different from G1 group PEDVs, which helps to explain why the CV777 vaccine strain could not provide sufficient protection against the PED outbreaks in some pig farms nowadays. It is contributed to understand the mutated circumstances of prevalent strain in order to provide reference material of PED preventive treatment. Fig. 7 .
