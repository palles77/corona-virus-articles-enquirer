            "text": "H uman Immunodeficency Virus type 1 (HIV-1), like many retroviruses, encodes some of its proteins in an overlapping open reading frame (ORF) that does not contain its own ribosomal initiation site. 1 This overlapped ORF can only be translated by a programmed ribosomal frameshifting event. In HIV-1, the ORF encoding the polyprotein for viral enzymes (Pol) is in a \u22121 reading frame relative to that encoding the structural proteins (Gag). Pol is only translated with a frequency of 5\u221210% of Gag, reflecting how often frameshifting occurs. 2 Deviation from this narrow range causes defects in the virus' ability to infect new cells. This was robustly demonstrated by Shehu-Xhilaga et al. in 2001. 3 Using a reverse transcriptase activity assay as a marker for infectivity in 293T cells, viral fitness was found to degrade by approximately 100fold as the Gag/Gag-Pol ratio changed from 20:1 to 20:21. These viral particles were also unable to correctly dimerize their genomic RNA, although recent work suggests that the frameshift site is not directly involved in packaging when the proper ratios of Gag/Gag-Pol are provided in trans. 4 Reduction in frameshift efficiency likewise interferes with viral replication. 5 Control of frameshifting in HIV-1 occurs via a frameshift stimulatory signal (FSS), a structured piece of the viral mRNA. Extensive analysis of this element, including NMR solution structures 6\u22128 and chemical probing using SHAPE, 9 suggests that a key structural feature of the HIV-1 FSS is a thermodynamically stable stemloop (Figure 1 , boxed upper region). This is preceded by a heptameric, uridine-rich \"slippery sequence,\" where the frameshift actually occurs, and other dynamically regulated regions of secondary structure. 9 The stemloop is highly conserved in HIV-1, with over 85% of all isolates containing the rare ACAA tetraloop motif, 6 and all subtypes of group M are predicted to fold into identical secondary structures with a nearly 100% conservation of base pairs. 2 Due to the virus' stringent control of the frequency of frameshifting, it has been suggested that small molecules able to bind the FSS-RNA and modulate this process could point the way to future HIV-1 therapeutics, 10, 11 as well as serving as prototypes for small molecules able to interfere with recoding events in other viruses. Efforts to identify such compounds have been complicated by the general challenge posed by sequenceselective RNA recognition. 12\u221214 While a bisbenzamide, 15 doxorubicin, 16 and guanidinoneomycin 17 have been examined as FSS RNA binders, their relatively low affinities and lack of specificity have limited their applicability as probes or drug leads. Building on the discovery of an HIV-1 FSS RNA binder identified via Resin-Bound Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry, 18 we recently reported the first synthetic compound able to bind the HIV-1 FSS RNA with a submicromolar dissociation constant and inhibit pseudotyped HIV infectivity. 19 Compound 1Z was found to bind FSS RNA with a K D of approximately 70 nM, was cell permeable, and strongly inhibited the infectivity of pseudotyped HIV in a dose-dependent manner. While successful, the selectivity of the 1Z\u2212FSS RNA binding interaction was modest (5:1 vs total yeast tRNA). In order to access compounds with enhanced anti-HIV activity and selectivity, we sought a simple modification that would be compatible with our synthetic scheme.",

A plasmid coding for VSV-G was cotransfected to allow for production of single cycle infectious virions. Producer cells were incubated with the compound for 24 h, after which the virions were harvested and normalized for viral load based on p24 ELISA.

All new compounds with the exception of 2E showed significantly greater antiviral activity in this assay than our previously reported compound 1Z, with compound 4E exhibiting the most potent activity (Figure 3 ). Data shown in the figure are a composite from two experiments; additional data may be found in the Supporting Information.

The transferred blot was then probed with an anti-p24 antibody, which will mark p24, as well as its precursor proteins p55 and p160. The ratio of p160 to p24+p55 was calculated by scanning densitometry (UVP VisionWorks software). The 20 \u03bcM lane for 4E was loaded with half as much protein due to a limiting quantity of virions. hydrophobicity relative to 1 and also was the most cellpermeable. Further, 4E showed the greatest ability to inhibit the production of infectious virions. Interestingly, 4E also affected not only the ability to make infectious virions but also severely limited the intracellular replication of the virus, as can be visualized via GFP production from the proviral plasmid in HEK 293T producer cells ( Figure 5 ). Thus, both the compound interferes with production of virus particles and the particles produced are less infective. While the availability of the compound increases with hydrophobicity, and appears to be the major limiting factor for antiviral effects, the discrepancy between compound 2E and 3E indicates that the increase in hydrophobicity is not the only governing factor for cell penetration. Based on the various patterns of N-methylation, it is not unreasonable to hypothesize that the differences are due to changes in the conformational ensembles of these molecules.

The concentration was chosen based on a preliminary titration using 1 \u03bcM compound to get a first approximation of the binding affinity and then lowered to more accurately measure the affinity. RNA was then titrated in from a high concentration stock (0.5\u221210 \u03bcM for HIV-1 FSS RNA; 10 \u03bcM for HIV-1 FSS DNA and tRNA) in 1\u221210 \u03bcL increments. After RNA was added, the solution was thoroughly mixed in the cuvette via pipetting and allowed to stand for 10 min to reach equilibrium. Each measurement was taken three times with a 1 min waiting period between scans to confirm equilibrium was reached. Intensities were corrected for dilution. All titrations were completed twice.",

The HIV-1 proviral vector (pDHIV3-GFP) includes all HIV-1 NL4\u22123 genes except nef (replaced with GFP) and env, thus preserving gag and pol, and the frameshift required for production of the Gag-Pol polyprotein. A single-round infectivity assay was conducted by transient transfection of the viral vector with VSV-G coat protein vector at a ratio of 1:0.5 using Fugene HD (Promega). The virus producer cells were dosed with compounds 4 h after transfection, and viral particles were harvested from the media 24 h after transfecting by filtering through a 0.45-\u03bcm syringe filter. Viral load was normalized with a p24 ELISA (PerkinElmer). The infections were performed using TZM-bl reporter cells containing stably integrated firefly luciferase, the expression of which is driven by the HIV-LTR promoter. Therefore, luciferase is expressed upon successful HIV infection. Triplicate infections in 96well plates at 10 000 cells/well with 500 pg p24/well proceeded for 48 h before the addition of SteadyGlo reagent (Promega) to each well for 30 min.
