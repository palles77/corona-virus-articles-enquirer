Bacteriological, virological and parasitical examination of the intestinal contents of rabbits that had died either in spontaneous field cases or after experimental reproduction of ERE, were undertaken in an attempt to identify infectious agents that may play a role in the disease. Two bacterial strains, Clostridium perfringens and non-enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, were repeatedly isolated at high faecal counts from naturally infected animals. In field cases, a correlation between typical gross lesions of epizootic enteropathy and the presence of the alpha toxin of Cl. perfringens was observed (P < 0.0001; Chi-squared test). Although attempts to reproduce the disease by inoculation with different pools of cultivable bacterial strains failed, the disease was successfully reproduced by inoculation with one French and two Belgian samples of caecal contents.",

The first outbreak was characterized by a sudden onset of abdominal distension and some diarrhoea in 6-14-week old rabbits . Gross lesions included dilatation of the stomach and the small intestine with mainly liquid contents. The caecum was either impacted or contained liquid, and mucus was occasionally present in the colon . Subsequently, these pathological lesions systematically appeared in other batches of rabbits showing similar clinical signs of ERE. Definitive diagnosis can however be difficult, and although it is based on the observation of the characteristic lesions, these can be modified by supervening secondary bacterial infections Marlier and Vindevogel, 1998) .",

Indeed, the demonstration from the start: (1) that the TEC3 inoculum was totally E. coli-free and, (2) that the ERE was fully reproduced by inoculation with TEC3 demonstrated that E. coli was not the aetiological agent of ERE (Licois et al., 2005) . So analysis conducted on E. coli strains were done specifically to avoid misdiagnosis. In rabbits, epizootics of colibacillosis are characterized by infection with attaching-effacing E. coli strains (for a review see Wales et al., 2005 ) that rarely produce enterotoxins or verotoxins (Pohl et al., 1993; Blanco et al., 1997) . In rabbits with intestinal colibacillosis, the presence of the eae gene is closely associated with diarrhoeal disease (Blanco et al., 1997) .",

This bacterial species is sometimes found in healthy animals including rabbits (Lee et al., 1991) but is usually considered one of the most widely occurring pathogenic bacteria and the first cause of clostridial enteric disease in animals (Songer, 1996) . Cl. perfringens strains can be classified into five toxinotypes A to E on the basis of the production of one or more of the four major toxins (a, b, e and i) (Cato et al., 1986; Petit et al., 1999) . In the present study, only strains from toxinotypes A and C were found. The interpretation of this finding in rabbits is difficult since these toxinotypes are considered primary pathogens in necrotic enteritis only of poultry. The apparent correlation between the presence of ERE gross lesions and detection of Cl. perfringens alpha toxin in the digestive contents of affected rabbits should not be misread. Indeed in experimentally induced ERE, high Cl. perfringens counts are only observed in 1/10 animals and in 1/5 control animals (D. Marlier and H. Vindevogel, unpublished data) . Thus, both the high E. coli and Cl. perfringens faecal counts and putative links between the alpha toxin and gross lesions might well reflect the intestinal disorders only, without being the cause.",

Rotaviruses are endemic in most rabbitries in which they only induce mild digestive disorders unless complicated by supervening bacterial infections (Thouless et al., 1996) .

Inocula-tion of weaned rabbits causes no mortality and only very discrete diarrhoea was induced (Peeters et al., 1986) .

Marlier and H. Vindevogel, unpublished data) . Tissues of the gut are very susceptible to post mortem desquamation of the epithelium, making a correct diagnosis very tricky. Wyers (2003) studied the microscopic lesions in SPF inoculated rabbits and confirmed the lack of inflammatory lesions but failed to identify any specific lesions of ERE. This was also the case in the histopathological sections from the ten inoculated-rabbits we analysed. Since only photonic microscopy was used, we performed a study dedicated to the comparison of the microscopical lesions in sections from the different parts of the intestinal tract by light microscopy (specific staining for intracellular organisms), scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (D. Marlier, unpublished data) . The presence of bacteria either adhering to the epithelial surface or within epithelial cells was observed in some animals by transmission electron microscopy (rods with an undulating outer membrane about 1500 nm in long and 700 nm in width) and by light microscopy following Warthin-Starry staining. These bacteria are supposed to be uncultivable. An aetiological role, if any, for these bacteria in ERE remains to be demonstrated.",

A possible explanation could be a greater number of freezingthawing cycles undergone by B1 and B2 leading to a loss of virulence. The mortality rate observed in SPF rabbits (15-33%) was lower than in naturally infected animals (30-80%) (Licois, 1998) , which suggests that secondary infection plays a key role in the field. The disease was not reproduced with the different pools of bacterial strains and the measured DWG remained high in the different groups.
