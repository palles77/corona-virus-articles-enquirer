This sequence is followed by a larger duplication which encompasses the region coding for the protein p80(LD), a molecular marker for cpBVDV. The SD element codes for the viral protease ~20. In the case of the viruses analyzed here the aminoterminus of p80 is generated by autoproteolytic removal of the preceding SD-encoded protease. For one of the cpBVDV isolates a specific fusion protein (~28) could be identified which is composed of p20 and part of ~10, another viral protein.",

These two biotypes are distinguished by their ability to replicate in tissue culture cells with or without cytopathic effect (cpBVDV or noncpBVDV, respectively). Elaborate studies revealed that a prerequisite for development of MD is an intrauterine infection with noncpBVDV (Brownlie et a/., 1984; Bolin et a/., 1985) .

The library screening was done with the same probe as used for the blot in Fig. 1 . In order to investigate the genomic localization of the respective cDNA fragment, BVDV-specific cDNA clones were first analyzed by determination of the terminal sequences (Fig. 2) . With respect to the published BVDV genomic sequences the 5' ends of clones pCB32 and pCB38 corresponded to positions around 7662 and 5529, while the 3'ends were homologous to sequences upstream of nucleotides 9814 and 6166 (pCB32 and pCB38, respectively). Accordingly, the expected sizes of the cDNA inserts in clones pCB32 and pCB38 are 2.15 and 0.64 kb, respectively. This finding already indicated the presence of sequence rearrangements in the genome of Pe515CP since the observed length of the cloned cDNAfragments was about 4.9 kb (pCB32) and 3.4 kb (pCB38) (Fig. 2) . To determine the genome organization of Pe5 15CP additional nucleotide sequencing of both pCB32 and pCB38 was employed (indicated by arrows in Fig. 2 ). The 5'end of the sequence shown in Fig. 3 corresponds to position 7089 of the published BVDV NADL genomic sequence (Collett et a/., 1988a) . Up to nucleotide 636 the determined Pe515CP sequence is colinear with the published sequences. Then 462 residues follow which do not show any homology to the respective BVDV genomic region. The third part of the sequence corresponds to the region following position 5423 of the BVDV genome (strain NADL) (Fig. 3A) . In general this genome organization is reminiscent of the one described for BVDV CPl with an insertion flanked by a duplicated viral sequence encompassing about 2.5 kb downstream of position 5423 (termed LD) (Fig. 5 ). For BVDV CPl the inserted element of 366 residues was a host cell-derived sequence coding for ubiquitin. Surprisingly, the 462 nucleotides present in the genome of Pe515CP (termed SD) are not of cellular origin but are homologous to the sequence located at position 428-889 of the BVDV NADL genome (Figs. 3A and 5). Accordingly, the genome of BVDV Pe515CP represents the product of a recombination process which probably involved only viral sequences.",

Priming in this region should provide cDNA clones encompassing the two recombination positions identified for Pe515CP (for nucleotide positions see Fig. 3A ). After screening the library with the pNCPII.1 probe clone pNCB3 was isolated which had a size of about 3.9 kb (Fig. 2) . Determination of the terminal sequences allowed the positioning of the cDNA insert between nucleotides 4886 and 9048 with respect to the BVDV NADL genome. with respect to a standard pestivirus genome were not observed.

We performed cDNA synthesis with an oligonucleotide primer which is complementary to nucleotides 1355 to 1374 of the published BVDV NADL sequence (OIBVD33). The singlestranded cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification; OIBVD33 and OIBVD32, the latter corresponding to position 364 to 388 of the NADL genome, served as primers. After cloning the resulting PCR fragment into pBluescript the nucleotide sequence of the resulting cDNA fragment was determined (Fig. 3C ) and found to be colinear with the respective region of the BVDV NADL genome. The nucleotide sequence homology between the PCR fragment derived from the 5' end of the genome and the SD element identified in the cDNA clones pCB32 and pCB38 (Fig. 3A) is 97%; the deduced amino acid sequence is 95% identical (Table  2) . Accordingly, the SD element is itself present in duplicate in the BVDV Pe515CP genome. Because of the high homology between each set of duplicated sequences (Tables 1 and 2 ) it can be concluded that they all originated from RNA molecules derived from just one BVDV strain, namely Pe515NCP.",

On the account of the molecular characterization of BVDV CPl and Pe515CP it was expected that a duplication of viral sequences was at least in part responsible for this increase in genome size. Following the strategy outlined above cDNA cloning was performed. The terminal sequences of the insert from plasmid pCP6/10 corresponded to positions 438 and 10851 of the BVDV NADL sequence and those from plasmid pCPG/N to 6877 and 8026 (Fig. 2) . Since the inserts of the two cDNA clones had sizes of 5.8 and 5.3 kb (pCPG/lO and pCPG/N, respectively) this finding strongly indicated rearranged viral sequences. For further investigation, part of pCPG/lO and pCPG/N was sequenced (Figs. 2 and 4) . The first 1188 determined nucleotides are colinear with the BVDV NADL sequence from 7869 to 9057. The following 507 residues again represent a sequence derived from the 5' part of a standard pestivirus genome. The 5'end of this element corresponds to position 383 of the NADL genome, thereby starting 3 nucleotides upstream of the viral translational initiation codon.

This antiserum recognizes ~125 from different BVDV strains as well as p54 and p41 from BVDV NADL and Osloss, respectively. Antibodies prepared against a bacterial fusion protein served for demonstration of p80 (antiA3) . After infection of MDBK cells with the four BVDV strains both antisera precipitated ~125 (Fig. 6A, lanes  l-8) . An additional band of 80 kDa could be detected for the cytopathogenic viruses Pe515CP and CP6 in experiments with the antiA serum (Fig. 6A, lanes 3  and 7, respectively) . Importantly, a protein corresponding to p54 of NADL or p41 of Osloss could not be precipitated by the anti-l 335 serum (Fig. 6A, lanes 2,  4, 6, and 8 ). Since ~125 is clearly recognized by the same antibodies, it can be concluded that cleavage of ~125 does not occur after infection with the analyzed viruses.

Accordingly, the 5' recombination point should be located downstream of the carboxyterminal processing site of ~125 thereby allowing expression of this protein from the sequences upstream of the SD element. In this case aberrant protein(s) could be translated from the region downstream of the ~125 gene. To investigate this hypothesis for BVDV Pe515CP RIP with different antisera, specific for the respective sequences, was performed.

Because of the rapid liberation of this polypeptide during translation which can also be observed in vitro, it has been proposed, that p20 represents an autoprotease (Wiskerchen eta/., 1991; Thiel eta/., 1991) . Recentlyexperimental evidence has been obtained for this theory (Wiskerchen eta/., 1991; Stark eta/., unpublished) . The sequence tryptophane-valine (position 164/l 65) has been proposed as the cleavage recognition site of this enzyme (Wiskerchen eta/., 1991) . Since the conserved 3' end of the SD elements maps to codon 168 of the BVDV ORF the putative cleavage signal is also duplicated and transferred to the downstream position. Ac- . Demonstration of autoproteolytic processing by the BVDV p20 protease. The products of in vitro translation of RNA transcribed from the linearized plasmids pCBP6 (lanes 1, 2, 3) and pCB32 (lanes 4, 5, 6) were precipitated with the sera antiG1 (lanes 1 and 4) an-tiDl* (lanes 2 and 5) and antiG40 (lanes 3 and 6) (for designation of antisera see Fig. 8 ) and separated by 11% SDS-PAGE. The aminoand carboxy-terminal products of the autoproteolytic cleavage reactions are marked by small and large arrowheads (pCBP6) or open and filled triangles (pCB32), respectively. cordingly, for BVDV Pe515CP and CP6 the aminoterminus of p80 could be generated in an autoproteolytic cleavage reaction executed by the preceding p20 protease. For BVDV CP6 the SD sequence covers the complete p20-coding region. In the case of Pe515CP, however, the aminoterminal 14 amino acids of the protease molecule are missing in the downstream SD element. To analyze whether this aminoterminally truncated enzyme is active, in vitro studies were performed. Clone pCB32 was linearized with Hindlll and used as template for in vitro transcription. The synthesized RNA contains an AUG suitable for translation initiation at position 94-96 (position 598-600 in Fig. 3A ). In order to provide a control for the cleavage reaction, clone pCBP6 which contains the I-kb PCR fragment encompassing the complete p20-coding region from the 5' part of the Pe5 15CP genome was also used for in vitro transcription.",

On the basis of PCR analyses it has been found that the genomes of several cpBVDV strains including Pe515CP do not contain insertions within the ~125 gene (DeMoerlooze et al., 1990) . For Pe515CP, this finding describes only one feature of the respective genomic region. The viral RNA contains a ~125 gene without insertion but nevertheless it represents the product of a recombination which affected pl25-coding sequences.

            "text": "Recombination at the RNA level has been observed for several RNAviruses. Template switching of the viral polymerase during replication or transcription has been proposed as a mechanism for these reactions (Lazzarini et al., 1981; Lai et a/., 1985; Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986; Makino et al., 1986; King et a/., 1987; and Khatchikian et al., 1989) . Based on this hypothesis a model for the generation of the cpBVDV genomic RNAs has been put forward which includes two subsequent switches (Meyers eta/., 1991) . Since the cellular mRNAs which serve as templates for integration of, e.g., ubiquitin-coding sequences, are present in the \"sense\" orientation in the cell and in the viral genome, the recombination should occur during synthesis of negative strand viral RNA. Interestingly, the 3' recombination position was the same for the genomes of CPl and Osloss and it was obvious to look for sequences responsible for this site specificity. Two different bovine polyubiquitin mRNAs were analyzed but no homology or complementarity between the sequences flanking the putative recombination positions in the viral and cellular RNAs could be identified . The same result was obtained when the nucleotides adjacent to the SD and LD regions of BVDV Pe515CP and CP6 were analyzed. Surprisingly, sequence comparison revealed identical 3' recombination positions regardless whetherviruses with ubiquitin-coding insertions or duplication of p20-and p80-coding sequences were looked at (Fig. 9) . It therefore has to be considered that the site-specific recombination observed for these viruses might be a result of functional pressure rather than being guided by specific sequences. This functional pressure could be based on the requirement of a given aminoterminus for the cpBVDV-specific protein ~80. Accordingly, development of a cytopathogenie virus in conjunction with outbreak of MD would represent the final step with regard to selection for the correct recombinant. Studies on coronaviruses tend to support this view since selection for certain recombination hotspots is preceded by random RNA recombination (Banner and Lai, 1991) .",

A prerequisite for generation of ~80 is the introduction of a protease cleavage site at the aminoterminus of this protein. Based on our current knowledge two basically different ways can be distinguished. One possibility is represented by the Osloss strain where the signal for cleavage is provided by a cellular ubiquitin sequence inserted into the ~125 region of the viral polyprotein. Ubiquitin itself is synthesized within eucaryotic cells in form of fusion proteins which are subsequently cleaved at the carboxyterminal end of the ubiquitin moiety (Finley et al., , 1989 azkaynak et a/., 1987; Redmann and Rechsteiner, 1989, Rechsteiner, 1987) .
