Published shortly after ICAR, a multi-author report entitled 'Highlights of the 30th International Conference on Antiviral Research' 1 gave an overview of a broad range of the ICAR presentations. In contrast, this meeting report gives detailed accounts of the lectures by the recipients of ISAR's three major awards, held in memory of Gertrude (Trudy) Elion, Anton \u0131n (Tony) Hol y and William (Bill) Prusoff, the presentation by the first ISAR Women in Science (WIS) awardee and the four Keynote addresses. Following the suggestion by Joe Colacino, a previous ISAR President, I have added my own personal comments within the 'My personal comments and Conclusion' section.",

He had not known her personally but felt that he had gained an appreciation of her work on acyclovir (ACV) through his time working closely with Phil Furman (a Past-President of ISAR) who was part of Trudy's team. Viral hepatitis is a major, worldwide clinical problem, with about 170 million chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 350 million with hepatitis B virus (HBV). In the USA, during the period 1999-2007, the burden of mortality with viral hepatitis due to HBV had been falling steadily (from six to four per 100,000 each year) whereas that due to HCV was rising (three to over four per 100,000 each year). In the same period, the mortality due to HIV was less than one per 100,000 each year. HCV has genotypes 1-6, genotype 1 being the most common in North and South America, Europe, Australasia and some parts of Asia, genotype 3 being most common in South Asia and all genotypes being found in differing proportions through Africa. When considering the prospects for finding a cure for HCV-infected patients, the high rates of HCV replication (10e 12 virions/day) and viral mutation (0.1-1 error per viral RNA synthesised) were seen as presenting a huge challenge. However, there was one aspect which offered hope; there was no known viral reservoir.",

            "text": "The HCV NS5B polymerase is an attractive drug target. It is highly conserved across all HCV genotypes -enhancing the chance of discovering a pan-genotype drug. Also, the highly active, critical nature of the polymerase active site means that any mutations resistant to nucleoside/tide drugs are likely to reduce polymerase efficiency and hence the fitness of the mutated virus and hence reduce the probability of generating highly resistant virus. When Mike joined Pharmasset, the standard-of-care HCV therapy was IFN together with ribavirin (RBV) which could not be used without IFN. The cost was high, in terms of dollars, time (one year) and in severe restrictions on patient lifestyle. Also, the outcome was uncertain, the cure rate being around 40%. But Pharmasset had an early lead compound, PSI-6130 ( Figure 2 ). PSI-6130 was highly selective for HCV versus other viruses, it was active in vitro against HCV polymerases from genotypes (GT) 1, 2, 3 and 4, was a non-obligate chain terminator of viral RNA and it had at least additive activity with other anti-HCV drugs. After passaging in cell culture for six months, a resistant mutant (S282T) was obtained but it was of low viral fitness and with no known pre-existing prevalence in the clinic. In rats and monkeys, the oral bioavailability was $ 20%. Of concern, there was deamination to give the uridine metabolite which was inactive against HCV. In monkeys, there was 40-70% conversion to the uridine metabolite.",

The bioavailability was modest ($ 25%) and, encouragingly, there was only 10% conversion to the inactive uridine metabolite. In collaboration with Roche, a prodrug approach was started with the aim to increase bioavailability and, if possible, decrease the conversion to the uridine metabolite. This programme led to RG7128. In a 14-day monotherapy Phase II study in HCV GT1 non-responder patients, there was a 2.7 log 10 reduction in HCV RNA levels. In a fourweek combination study (RG7128 (1000 or 1500 mg bid) with pegylated IFN and RBV), there was $ 90% response rate with safety comparable to the corresponding placebo control. Certainly, this was an encouraging result but the high doses and the twicedaily dosing regimen were of concern which were unlikely to be overcome by the prodrug approach. So was there another option?

To further optimise the cure rates, Gilead combined sofosbuvir with an NS5A inhibitor, ledipasvir, which became Harvoni V R . However, ledipasvir has now been largely replaced by velpatasvir, another NS5A inhibitor but with an improved genetic barrier to resistance. This combination is Epclusa V R which gives >96% cure rate for all genotypes 1-6. Sofosbuvirbased cure regimens have been shown to be effective in patients co-infected with HIV, in previously difficult- ) received approval from the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2013. Since then, more than a million patients have been cured on sofosbuvir-based regimens. Although at least 15 nucleoside/tide drugs have entered clinical development, sofosbuvir remains the only approved nucleoside/tide drug for HCV therapy. It is the drug of choice to act as the 'backbone' of HCV combination therapies -only sofosbuvir has a sufficiently high genetic barrier to viral resistance combined with an excellent safety profile. HCV could become a rare disease if the issues regarding patient access can be resolved.",

Although the circulating HBV DNA can remain below detectable levels for years, the viral reservoir, i.e. covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), remains. Preventing the cccDNA from being transcriptionally active would reduce the levels of circulating HBV antigens and thereby may restore the host immune activity.

AB-423 also inhibits cccDNA synthesis, presumably by inhibiting the capsid uncoating process. There is at least additive activity in cell culture assays when combined with nucleoside/tide drugs and with ARB-1740 (see below). Similar results were obtained in a mouse model. ARB-1467 is a combination of three siRNAs packaged in lipid nanoparticles. By targeting all four viral RNA transcripts, ARB-1467 inhibits the production of all four HBV antigens. In a mouse model, ARB-1467 gives a rapid reduction of HBV virions and antigens in both liver and blood samples. ARB-1740 has improved in vivo potency and longer duration of activity relative to ARB-1467. ARB-1740 has modified oligonucleotide chemistry and changes in the HBV sites targeted. In a dose escalation Phase II trial, ARB-1467 doses increased from 0.2 mg/kg monthly to 0.4 mg/kg biweekly, with a possible extension up to a year based on the outcome after three months.

FMCA, retained good activity against all these strains, the change in EC 50 values versus the wt virus was between 1.0-and 1.2-fold. In a separate cell culture assay, FMCA and its phosphoramidate prodrug (FMCA-P) were tested against an entecavir-resistant strain (L180M/M204V/ S202G). Both FMCA and its prodrug retained good activity (1.2-and 0.9-fold). Although the data were not shown, FMCA also retains activity against tenofovir-resistant strains.",

This triggers clathrin-dependent uptake of the virion. Acidification of the endosomal compartment triggers structural changes in E leading to its reorganisation and refolding as a post-fusion trimer (E 3 ). These structural changes in E bring the endosome and viral membranes in close enough proximity to fuse, leading to formation of a fusion pore through which the viral genome can escape into the cytoplasm. In this fusion process, E acts as a catalyst in that it lowers the energy barrier for membrane fusion, but it has no classical active site to which an inhibitor can be rationally targeted. In addition, although each virion has 180 copies of E (90 pre-fusion dimers) that can reorganise as 60 post-fusion trimers, it has been unclear how many of these copies of E must be bound by an inhibitor to prevent fusion. Is it possible to inhibit this process with drugs?

For the primary antiviral assay, cells were infected with dengue virus serotype 2, the compound added 1 h after infection and the assay read at three days, to allow inhibitors of every step in the viral life cycle, including viral spread, to be identified. In secondary screens, time-of-addition experiments were performed, including experiments in which compound treatment was restricted to a preincubation of the viral inoculum and the initial 1 h infection period. This enabled identification of three chemical series, 2,4-diaminopyrimidines, 4,6-disubstituted pyrimidines and cyanohydrazones that all appeared to inhibit dengue virus entry via binding to a target present in the viral inoculum. Medicinal chemistry efforts were used to improve the initial lead compounds, leading to inhibitors including 1-100-1 (4,6-disubstituted pyrimidine), 7-148-6, 2-12-2 (2,4-diaminopyrimidine) and 3-110-22 (cyanohydrazone) that had 90% effective concentration (EC 90 ) values in cell culture between 2 and 10 mM. Medicinal chemistry was also used to generate derivatives containing biotin and fluorophores, which were used to demonstrate binding to pre-fusion, E 2, rather than to post-fusion, E 3 . An in vitro fusion assay monitoring pH-triggered fusion of virions to synthetic liposomes was used to demonstrate that all three compound series inhibit E-mediated fusion. To establish where these compounds bind on E 2 , virus was serially passaged in the presence of inhibitors to select for resistance mutations. Up to passage 9, no resistance was detected with three of the compounds but resistance to 7-148-6 was obtained at passage 4, due to a single mutation, E-M196V, located in the detergentbinding pocket. This mutation reduces the affinity of recombinant E for all three series of inhibitors. The mutation T171A located in domain I away from the pocket also confers resistance to compound 3-110-22, but does so without affecting the affinity of the E-3-110-22 interaction. Additional point substitutions in the pocket were chosen from naturally occurring E sequences identified in public databases. These were introduced to the pocket (Q52A, F193L, M272S, L277M and F279S) by site-directed mutagenesis and the impact of each of these substitutions was assessed by measurement of Kd values against each of four compounds (3-110-22, 7-148-6, 2-12-2, GNF-2 and 1-100-1). The compounds were all affected by mutations in the pocket but 'footprints' of inhibitors in the same structural class were more similar to each other than to compounds in the other structural classes. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that all three inhibitor series bind in pocket between domains I and II.",

In 1988, GPEI was started with four partners, the World Health Organisation, Rotary International, CDC and UNICEF. In 1988, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution that set out their aim, to eradicate polio by 2000. Although 17 years later, that target has still not been achieved, the burden of disease has been successfully reduced. In the 1988 baseline year, there were about 350,000 cases/year in 125 countries -by the 2000 target year, there were less than 3000 cases. Each year, this low number of cases has continued to decline, there being just five cases in two countries (Afghanistan and Pakistan) so far this year (April 2017). Initially, the oral vaccine (OPV), containing attenuated viruses of the three serotypes, was widely used because its administration was so easy. It was highly effective in reducing the number of new cases. Although most vaccinated subjects clear the attenuated virus, a small reservoir of virus was identified in immunocompromised subjects. As the number of polio cases have declined in a particular area, the oral vaccine has been replaced by the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), thus avoiding the creation of potential new virus reservoirs. However, IPV supply shortages are a problem. OPV remains in use in most countries.",

            "text": "During prolonged replication of OPV in immunocompromised subjects, polioviruses can evolve rapidly, the RNA replication error rate being $10 \u00c04 /cycle. In an individual, there are about 1 or 2 base substitutions/ week, giving an overall evolution rate of about 1%/ year. For comparison, this mutation rate is faster than that for HIV, influenza viruses and HCV, viruses generally considered to be rapidly evolving. Most mutations will generate synonymous codons that do not alter the protein coding. However, the few, critical, attenuating mutations in OPV are under negative selection pressure to revert towards the wt. Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) have been defined on the basis of threshold divergence in the VP1 capsid protein, There have been a few vaccine-associated paralytic polio cases, about 1-2/1,000,000 (cf. 1/200 from wt virus). Various types of immune deficiency can lead to prolonged virus shedding (>6 months) but severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) can result in chronic shedding (>5 years). One individual has been shedding poliovirus for >30 years. Regardless of paralysis status, VDPV in immunodeficient subjects (iVDPV) has been identified as a major threat to polio eradication, especially in those countries that do not have a good medical system. In countries from which poliovirus has been eliminated for many years, the chronic excretors have largely either cleared the virus or died. For example, in the UK there is just one individual alive and still excreting virus after 32 years. In the USA, there may be none remaining, with one potential case lost to follow-up.",

However, if the male has genital infections with lesions, then the bottleneck is less severe, comparable to that when the female partner is infected.

For individuals with low VL (10 2 -10 3 ), intermediate VL (10 3 -10 5 ) and high VL (>10 5 ), the proportion retaining more than 300 CD4 cells/mm 3 were 100%, about 25% and virtually 0%, respectively. Indeed, the high VL group reached the end point within three years (p \u00bc <0.001). In a similar study comparing individuals infected with low vRC, intermediate vRC and high vRC virus, the latter also lost CD4 cells more rapidly with only $25% with CD4 count > 300. In contrast, 50% low vRC individuals retained CD4 cells above 300. To determine if this detrimental effect of higher vRC was simply an effect on VL, individuals infected with low and high vRC viruses, but with similar set point VLs (3.8 and 4.0 log 10 ), respectively, were compared.

This is because in the infecting partner, the HLA-directed cellular immune response leads to the selection of escape mutations. How does the transmission of such HLA-associated mutations effect the immune recognition of the transmitted founder virus in its new host? Because of successive selection in previous hosts, it is possible that some of the transmitted virus will already be 'adapted' to the immune system of the newly infected person. On the other hand, virions, which retain the consensus epitopes, are likely to be more easily recognised by the immune system. Therefore, samples of PBMCs were taken from 20 newly infected individuals (68 days after estimated infection) and stimulated with peptides corresponding to adapted (42) and non-adapted (61) epitopes in their founder virus. This work confirmed that prior immune selection history could render the transmitted virus either more or less visible to the new host's immune system. Adaption of the virus can reduce the protective effects of potentially favourable HLA alleles and impact the ability of the newly infected individual's immune system to control the virus.",

High vRC and adapted epitopes will aid rapid disease progression. Alternatively, these functions can oppose each other, the balance defining viral virulence. Although there are no approved antiviral therapies for flaviviruses, there are some vaccines, for example, yellow fever virus vaccine. This suggests that a vaccine for Zika virus may be possible -certainly, the medical need is high. Generally, inactivated vaccines and subunit vaccines have a better safety profile than live attenuated vaccines. However, the later may give lifetime immunity after a single dose, a feature that Pei-Yong considered critical for a successful Zika vaccine. He has considered two possible approaches to produce an attenuated vaccine with a good safety profile; to knockout a key viral enzyme or to delete sections of the three prime untranslated region (3 0 UTR). His target enzyme was methyltransferase, which enables the Zika virus to acquire a cap to protect the viral RNA. The active site was inactivated by changing two amino acids. In the 3 0 UTR approach, he compared vaccines with 10-, 20and two different 30-nucleotide deletions. Rather unexpectedly, the 10-nucleotide deletion (10-del ZIKV) seemed to be more attenuated than both a 20-or 30nucleotide deletion vaccines. This may be due to the 10del ZIKV being more susceptible to IFN than the other deletion vaccines -the reason for the differing IFN responses is not known. The 10-del ZIKA vaccine was the focus of the remainder of his ICAR presentation. The initial evaluation was done in a mouse model using type 1 IFN receptor-deficient A129 mice. To study the protective effect provided by vaccination in pregnant mice, C57BL/6 mice were used. Studies on male mice used A129 mice. Then safety and efficacy were confirmed in rhesus macaques.",

There were four groups, a positive control with wt ZIKV administered on day 0 (n \u00bc 4), active groups vaccinated (10 3 IFU sc) with 10-del ZIKA (n \u00bc 4) and 20-del ZIKA (n \u00bc 3) vaccines, respectively, and a placebo control (n \u00bc 2). Viraemia was measured from day 2 to 10 and antibody levels from day 2 to 56. On day 56, all groups were challenged with ZIKV (PRVABC59, 10 3 PFU). Viraemia was measured from day 58 to 66 and antibody levels from day 70 to 98. As expected, the infected control group had high viraemia, high antibody levels from day 14 and had no viraemia after virus challenge. The placebo group had neither viraemia nor antibodies until after the virus challenge. Following vaccination with 10-del ZIKA vaccine, only 1/4 animals had detectable viraemia, 4/4 had moderate levels of antibodies which rose more than four-fold on virus challenge. In spite of the suboptimal levels of antibodies, no viraemia was detected after the virus challenge. In the 20-del ZIKA vaccine group, 2/3 had low levels of viraemia and 3/3 with high antibody levels from day 14 onwards. After virus challenge, there was minimal increase in antibody levels (0/ 4 with a four-fold rise) and there was no viraemia. Both deletion vaccines appeared to have a good safety profile.",

Then Mike continued at Gilead to assist in the development of sofosbuvir. The clinical introduction of sofosbuvir transformed the therapy of HCV, becoming the 'backbone' of various combination therapies.

Pharmasset understood that all the drugs, with the highest genetic barriers, were nucleoside/tide analogues (but, of course, not all nucleoside/tide analogues have a high genetic barrier). For all viruses which have high mutation rates (e.g. HIV and HCV), combination therapy needs at least one drug with a high genetic barrier. A good safety profile is just as important as a good activity -at Pharmasset, compounds were assessed in a cascade, which started with a test for activity (an HCV replicon assay), but this assay also included a ribosomal-RNA cytotoxicity test. The next steps in the cascade were all aimed at assessing the safety profilecytotoxicity evaluations in a panel of five cell lines with replicating cells, mitochondrial toxicity and bone marrow toxicity. To my knowledge, it is rare to find a compound-screening strategy giving so much emphasis to the safety profile at such an early stage in the evaluation of a novel compound. This strategy led to PSI-6130, being identified as a compound with potential, when their competitors had compounds which may have had comparable activities but not the same safety profile. The Pharmasset selection strategy had led to a compound having a 'hidden' advantage over all the competitor compounds.",

Appreciating that an apparent problem (partial metabolism to an inactive compound) was a potential opportunity, it was decided to investigate the uridine analogue. This led to the testing of the cytosine and uridine triphosphate analogues versus the viral polymerase. Although the uridine analogue (PSI-6206-TP) was less potent than the cytidine analogue (PSI-6130-TP) as an inhibitor of the HCV polymerase, the half-life (T 1/2 ) of PSI-6206-TP was much longer than that of PSI-6130-TP (38 and 5 h, respectively). The 38 h half-life would enable PSI-6206 to be administered once daily. The second crucial decision was to select the half-life as the more important parameter, the reduced activity as being of less importance. A prodrug approach was initiated to maximise activity, synthesising and evaluating many phosphoramidate prodrugs in order to select the best candidate drug. Each of these steps was important for the discovery of sofosbuvir which happened much earlier than expected.",

In my 2016 ICAR meeting report, 7 Jerome Deval (Alios BioPharma) and his colleagues chose to screen only nucleoside analogues for activity against RSV. Now, ALS-8176 (lumicitabine) looks set to become the game-changer for RSV therapy as sofosbuvir was for HCV therapy. Their success follows in the footsteps of Pharmasset.

It has been confirmed that small molecules can interact with E to give activity in both a target-based assay and a cell culture antiviral assay. The next step is to validate E as an antiviral target in vivo. Although it is necessary to confirm antiviral activity, it is also necessary to show that this approach can lead to antiviral compounds having a high genetic barrier to resistance. It was an encouraging start to find that some compounds did not show resistance up to passage 9. However, I think that Sophie Duraffour holds the record for ICAR's longest resistance test, with resistance to (S)-HPMPDAP appearing in two strains of camelpox virus after passaging 30 times, taking 18 months, before resistant clones could be obtained. (Sophie Duraffour, 22nd ICAR, 3-7 May in Miami Beach, FL, USA). To investigate resistance to dengue, Priscilla's group prepared various dengue mutant viruses containing point substitutions, which were chosen from naturally occurring E sequences identified in public databases. None of the current compounds were active against all these mutant strains. Surely, that suggests that, for these compounds, resistance will be a critical factor to be investigated.",

Hugh Field 8 and I devised the term 'back door escape route'. We illustrated the concept using the HIV protease. When treating an HIV patient with a single PI, the first (primary) resistance mutation will decrease the inhibition by the antiviral drug but perhaps by a small degree. Then other mutations (secondary) will further decrease the inhibition by the drug. These mutations are usually near the active centre of the protease. Further mutations (tertiary) may be remote from the active centre and may not decrease the inhibition of the drug but restore some of the lost functionality of the protease. By carful combination of PIs with different resistance mutations, it may be that none of the spontaneously arising mutant proteases can be both resistant to the drugs and be a competent enzyme -the 'front door is locked'. However, there is a 'back door escape route' -the viral RNA encoding both the protease and that for the cleavage sites (the protease substrate) can co-mutate so that both the enzymic activity and the substrate change. The altered protease is no longer inhibited by the PIs, it has 'escaped through the back door'. The 'back door escape route' is not available to the viral polymerases because the natural nucleotides are absolutely required for building the viral DNA/RNA. Hence, careful combinations of nucleoside/tide analogues have given the drug therapies with the highest genetic barriers.",

I consider it optimistic to expect the inhibition or blocking of a host protein will give an antiviral therapy that is free from viral resistance problems. Although the target host protein may not be subject to change, the virus may well be able to use a 'back door escape route'. Priscilla Yang's team may find that is so for their antiviral approach. To my mind, the important result from her work is a good demonstration that antiviral compounds, which maybe not good enough for clinical use, are effective tools to learn more about viral replication. Her compounds have given more information about the dengue virus fusion process. I recall discussing with my friends from Roche at the 1999 ICAR (Jerusalem) the use of their HSV thymidine kinase inhibitors to investigate how an initially (immature) latently infected cell can mature to become a competent latently infected cell from which HSV can reactivate. Shortly afterwards, that work was closed down but the opportunity still remains. I ought to declare an interest in such an investigation into herpesvirus latency -famciclovir appears to act like a thymidine kinase inhibitor, preventing immature latently infected cells maturing 8 (and references therein).",

Beechams had just switched from a Department system to Project-based format. I joined a newly formed multidisciplinary antiviral team. Many of us felt that the Project system worked well. I am interested in Maaike's work helping to re-creating a Project system. She mentioned many of the pros and cons which we faced during my time at Beechams. I hope these comments help to illustrate the value of ICAR in bringing many different aspects of antiviral research together.

In samples from central Europe dating about 1000 years before present, the proportions had reversed (85 and 15%, respectively). In modern times, the majority of humans have both genes for the Cys 529 protein, ranging from 53% in Africa to 87% in Asia, with the Americas (75%) and Europe (68%) having intermediate values.
