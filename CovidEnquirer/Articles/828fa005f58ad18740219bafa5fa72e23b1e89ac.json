Indeed, a major step that allowed genome expansion in CoVs and, more generally, in Nidovirales, was the acquisition of a set of RNA-processing enzymes that improved the low fidelity of RNA replication [9] . These enzymes include an RNA 3 0to-5 0 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and possibly an endoribonuclease (NendoU) [9] . Additional evidence, though, suggests that features distinct from replication fidelity underlie genome expansion in Nidovirales.

Very recently, SARSr-BatCoVs from Rhinolophus sinicus (Rs) and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (Rf) were isolated Glossary dN: the observed number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site. dS: the observed number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site. Hemagglutinin-esterases (HEs): a family of viral proteins that mediate binding to O-acetylated sialic acids. Homology: the relationship between elements (e.g., genes, proteins) deriving from a common ancestor. Lectins: a group of proteins with carbohydrate recognition activity. Lectins are categorized in many distinct families depending on structural and functional properties. Maximum likelihood (ML): is a statistical method for estimating population parameters from a data sample. Given one or more unknown parameters and a sample data, the ML estimates of the parameters are the values maximizing the probability of obtaining the observed data. Open reading frame (ORF): the part of a reading frame that contains no stop codons. An ORF is a continuous stretch of nucleotide triplets that have the potential to code for a protein or a peptide. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs): are enzymes that break a phosphodiester bond. PDEs belonging to the 2H family are characterized by two H-F-[S/T]-F motifs (where F is a hydrophobic residue) separated by an average of 80 residues. Positive selection: the accumulation of favorable amino acid-replacing substitutions, which results in more nonsynonymous changes than expected under neutrality (dN/dS>1). Purifying selection: the elimination of deleterious amino acid-replacing substitutions, which results in fewer nonsynonymous changes than expected under neutrality (dN/dS < 1) (it is also referred to as negative selection). Viroporins: hydrophobic viral proteins that can promote the formation of channels following insertion into the host cell membrane and oligomerization. Box 1. Molecular Evolution in Viruses: General Concepts RNA viruses are rapidly evolving pathogens that can accumulate considerable genetic diversity in relatively short time periods. This is mostly due to their high nucleotide mutation rates (but see text for CoVs). The diversity of extant viral sequences can be analyzed to construct phylogenetic relationships among species/strains and to infer the underlying evolutionary patterns. In the presence of recombination a single phylogenetic tree is unable to describe the evolution of homologous sequences. Because recombination is common in many viruses, including HCoVs, the evolution of viral genomes is best modeled by several phylogenies, one for each nonrecombinant fragment (Box 2). By reassorting mutations, recombination has the potential to generate novel viral phenotypes. Thus, not only recombination is of interest per se, but failure to account for its presence can distort phylogeny-based analyses, including estimates of natural selection [66] . Natural selection acts pervasively on viral sequences. When coding regions are concerned, natural selection is commonly estimated in terms of \u03c9 (also referred to as dN/dS)that is, the observed number of nonsynonymous differences per nonsynonymous site (dN) over the observed number of synonymous differences per synonymous site (dS). Under neutral evolution, \u03c9 is expected to be equal to 1, as the rate at which amino acid substitutions accumulate is similar to the rate for synonymous changes. Due to the fact that essential protein domains can often tolerate only minor sequence changes, most amino acid replacements are eliminated by selection; this generates \u03c9 values <1, a situation referred to as negative (or purifying) selection. Nevertheless, amino acid replacements can be advantageous for a virus in terms, for example, of host adaptation or immune evasion: in this case \u03c9 values can be higher than 1 (positive selection). Thus, evaluation of how \u03c9 varies from site to site or from branch to branch in a phylogeny is commonly used to describe selective events. Some possible caveats should nevertheless be kept in mind. (i) The saturation of substitution rates (especially dS) may occur and affect evolutionary inference when fast-evolving sequences are analyzed (see Box 3 for an example, and Box 2 for methods to overcome this problem). (ii) In viral genomes synonymous substitutions are not always neutral; this may be due to the presence of overlapping reading frames, conserved RNA secondary structures, packaging signals, and other functional elements (Box 3). (iii) A relaxation in the intensity of both negative and positive selection may occasionally occur (Box 2 and Figure 2A ). CoVs that infect nonhuman mammals are included only if they are mentioned in the text for comparative purposes. (A) The phylogenetic tree of complete genome sequences of HCoVs and selected mammalian CoVs was obtained with RAxML 8.2.4 [68] . Numbers indicate bootstrap support. CoVs are colored according to [14, 15] . Analysis of the ORF8 region revealed high sequence identity with civet/human SARS-CoV. Two groups came to the conclusion that recombination within SARSr-Rs-CoVs or between SARSr-Rs-CoVs and SARSr-Rf-CoVs led to the acquisition of an ORF8 closely related to that of civet/human SARS-CoV and ultimately originated the virus responsible for the human epidemic [14, 15] . Interestingly, Lau and coworkers also reported that the ORF8 region has a dN/ dS = 3.5 in SARS-CoVs isolated from humans (but not in SARSr-BatCoVs), indicating the action of positive selection (Box 1) [14] . This finding is interesting per se and becomes even more important considering that, early in the human epidemic, SARS-CoVs acquired a signature 29nucleotide deletion which split ORF8 into two functional ORFs (ORF8a and b) [16] . These findings suggest that rapid evolution of ORF8 might facilitate host shifts [14] . This possibility is, however, questioned by the presence of additional SARS-CoV human isolates that carry independent and larger deletions in the ORF8 region [16] . Thus, an alternative explanation Box 2 ",

Alternatively, branch-site models can be applied to detect episodic positive selection on specific branches of the phylogeny. Different methods allow to test a priori whether a branch is under selection [74, 75] or to model different evolutionary scenarios for each branch [76] . When evolutionary analysis is focused on recent timescales, selection may not have yet fixed the advantageous mutations or removed the deleterious ones. One possibility is to compare the distribution of nonsynonymous and synonymous polymorphisms in a specific lineage with the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous fixed differences between lineages/species. The McDonald-Kreitman test [77] has been widely applied for this purpose.",

If this were the case, relaxed purifying selection rather than positive selection might be responsible for the high dN/dS. To disentangle these alternative possibilities we analyzed ORF8 in human and civet viruses that carry an intact gene, as well as in bat viruses. Although we confirmed that dN/dS is well above 1 for human/civet SARS-CoV ORF8, we detected no evidence of positive selection using the M7/M8 'site models' from PAML (Box 2) or with PARRIS (PARtitioning approach for Robust Inference of Selection) [17] (Figure 2A) . Instead, we obtained evidence that relaxation of natural selection [18] in ORF8 accompanied the shift from bats to civets/humans (Figure 2A) .

An analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene in 43 CoVs provided a first estimate of around 10 000 years ago for the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the four genera [83] . This result was questioned on the basis of observations suggesting a longstanding interaction between CoVs and their hosts [82] . Thus, Wertheim and coworkers hypothesized that natural selection, in particular negative selection, resulted in a bias of the tMRCA estimate [82] . Indeed, strong negative selection can result in the saturation of substitutions at synonymous sites and consequently in underestimation of branch lengths in a phylogeny. To overcome this issue, the authors applied a branch-site test (see Box 1) [76] to estimate branch lengths while taking into account the effect of different selective pressures among lineages in the CoV phylogeny [82] . Their findings placed the separation of the four CoV genera around 300 million years ago, highlighting the importance of evolutionary models in molecular clock dating. Interestingly, this tMRCA is consistent with the separation time between mammals and aves [84] , suggesting a coevolutionary relationship between coronavirus and their hosts. However, the dating estimates obtained for closely related viruses by Wertheim and coworkers were in agreement with previous studies, suggesting that the action of natural selection is not biasing the estimation of more recent divergence times. Although most HCoVs were identified only recently, molecular clock analyses indicate that some of these viruses diverged from closely related CoVs hundreds of years ago. In particular, the emergence of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E has been roughly estimated around 500-800 and 200 years ago, respectively [85, 86] . HCoV-OC43 is thought to have shared a common ancestor with BCoV around 120 years ago [87] . As for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, molecular dating studies estimated that they diverged from bat CoVs in the last three decades [14, 88] . Finally, the MRCA of HCoV-HKU1 extant lineages was estimated to have existed in the 1950s [60] . Clearly, these dates should be regarded as estimates and confidence intervals are often wide. A timeline for the emergence of HCoVs is depicted in Figure I .",

These viral enzymes cleave 2',5'-oligoadenylate, the product of OAS proteins, to prevent activation of the cellular endoribonuclease RNase L and consequently block interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral responses [23] . The PDE activity in the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) NS2a protein is critical for hepatovirulence [23] . HCoV-OC43, as well as other lineage A nonhuman beta-CoVs, encode NS2a proteins that are characterized by a high degree of sequence similarity to the MHV PDE ( Figure 1B) Figure 2B ). AKAP7 and the viral PDEs display structural homology ( Figure 2B ), and murine AKAP7 can complement an inactive MHV NS2a gene [25] . From an evolutionary standpoint, these observations suggest that: (i) beta-CoVs and rotaviruses have independently acquired PDE activities; and (ii) AKAP7 served as the source gene in both viral genera ( Figure 2B ). More recently, a PDE activity was also discovered in the NS4b protein of MERS-CoV ( Figure 1B) and other lineage C beta-CoVs [26]. Similar to those in lineage A beta-CoVs and rotavirus, NS4b belongs to the 2H-phosphoesterase family and displays a predicted structure homologous to AKAP7 [26] ( Figure 2B ). It remains to be determined whether NS4b was acquired by capturing a vertebrate AKAP7, but the observation that distinct viruses acquired, most likely independently, a PDE activity underscores the importance of these enzymes for viral fitness.",

Hemagglutinin-esterases (HEs) are encoded by lineage A beta-CoVs (e.g., HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43) ( Figure 1B) , as well as influenza C virus and toroviruses. Structural analysis suggested that these viral enzymes derive from an ancestral host lectin, although it is unclear whether acquisition occurred in an ancestral virus followed by speciation or multiple times [27] . Incidentally, the N-terminal domain of the CoV spike protein is also believed to derive from a cellular lectin [28] . Unlike the influenza virus C enzyme, CoV HEs lack membrane-fusion activity and are accessory to the spike protein by serving primarily as receptor-destroying enzymes (RDE)that is, they aid viral detachment from carbohydrates present on infected cells [29, 30] . In fact, HEs are present only in the genome of lineage A beta-CoVs, most of which use sialic acids as coreceptors [1] ( Figure 1B) . These observations suggest that sialic acid-binding spike proteins coevolved with HE genes serving as RDEs. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the MHV spike protein evolved from an ancestral sugar-binding preference to a protein-binding mode and that several MHV strains lost expression of HE [27, 28] ( Figure 1B) .",

Such changes most likely result from passages in culture that, on one hand, relieve the virus from pressures exerted in vivo (e.g., by the host immune system) and, on the other hand, derive from viral adaptation to the in vitro system. An example of these effects is the loss of a fulllength ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain which, due to a two-nucleotide deletion, has a split gene, encoding two proteins (ORF4a and ORF4b) [31, 32] ( Figure 1B) . Conversely, clinical isolates display a full-length ORF4 sequence [32] . An intact ORF4 is also observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E [19, 22] , whereas the alpaca alpha-CoV displays a onenucleotide insertion, resulting in a frameshift [20] ( Figure 1B) . The availability of only a single alpaca CoV genome makes it impossible to determine whether the inserted sequence is representative of the alpaca CoV population or, else, if it represents a sequencing error.",

Limited similarity is also observed with the SARS-CoV protein, especially in the first and second transmembrane regions, suggesting either a common origin or independent acquisition followed by convergent optimization of residues in the transmembrane helices ( Figure 2C) . Conversely, the HCoV-OC43 protein (encoded by ORF5, originally denoted NS12.9) is unrelated to the other CoV viroporins, both in terms of sequence and of domain topology [34] ( Figure 2C) . A protein homologous to the HCoV-OC43 viroporin is instead encoded by MHV (accessory protein NS5a) and functions as an antagonist of IFNinduced antiviral responses [34, 36] . Whether the HCoV-OC43 viroporin has the same IFNantagonizing activity remains to be investigated; however, mutant viruses lacking ORF5 display growth defects in vitro and in vivo, as well as reduced virulence in mice [34] . Interestingly, the viroporins from SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E can complement the viroporindefective mutant HCoV-OC43 in vitro [34] . Thus, the conserved function of CoV viroporins was most likely attained by convergent evolution for acquisition of unrelated genes.",

Contrary to common expectation and to what happened during the SARS-CoV host shift to humans, positive selection did not target the RBD. In fact, most adaptive substitutions were detected in the region encompassing the heptad repeats, regions of central importance for virus cell entry ( Figure 3A ) [42, 43] . In other CoVs, variants in the heptad repeats were previously shown to affect host or tissue tropism [44] [45] [46] . Interestingly, during the South Korean outbreak, MERS-CoVs that carry point mutations in the spike protein RBD emerged and rapidly spread [47] . These viruses showed decreased binding to the cellular receptor [47] ( Figure 3A ). Because several immune epitopes are located in the RBD, these findings point to the possibility that MERS-CoV is evolving to avoid the binding of neutralizing antibodies, resulting in a trade-off with receptor-binding affinity [47] . If this were the case, the phases of MERS-CoV adaptation to humans may have consisted of initial events that modulated host tropism through changes in the heptad repeats followed by the emergence of virus variants that escape immune responses. In MERS-CoV and other lineage C beta-CoVs, positive selection also targeted the nonstructural components, particularly ORF1a [48] . Most adaptive events occurred in nsp3, a multifunctional protein which acts as a viral protease and contributes to the suppression of interferon responses through its deubiquitinating and deI-SGylating activities [49] . Selection in nsp3 is ongoing among MERS-CoV isolated from humans and camels [48] . In analogy to the S protein, though, no major selective event was found to be associated with camel-to-human transmission, although a positively selected change (R911C) in nsp3 was observed among human-derived viruses alone, suggesting that viral adaptation to our species represented the underlying pressure [48] .",

Also, HCoV-229E acquired a deletion in the S gene compared to bat viruses [19] . Recent sequencing of several of such viruses showed that this deletion is also present in the alpaca CoV S gene and in camel-derived alpha-CoVs [22] . This finding is particularly interesting because deletions in the NTD are associated with changes in tissue tropism in TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus): in this porcine virus the spike has dual tropism for the respiratory and intestinal tracts, but the N-terminally deleted variants from PRCV (porcine respiratory coronavirus) only infect the respiratory tract [50, 51] . In chiroptera, CoVs are mainly restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, whereas in humans and camelids, the upper and lower respiratory airways are infected. It will be important to determine whether the S gene deletion in HCoV-229E and camelid alphaCoVs is indeed responsible for a change in tissue tropism.",

            "text": "HCoV-NL63 Recombination contributed to shaping the diversity of the S gene among HCoV-NL63 viruses. Recombination between an ancestral HCoV-NL63 virus and the related PEDV was also detected in the M gene that, in its 3 0 portion, is more similar to PEDV than to HCoV-229E [52] . Like SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 uses its RBD to bind ACE2. The binding site on the cellular receptor is the same for the two viruses but the RDBs show no sequence similarity. Interestingly, the RBDs of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 do not display any structural similarity either: HCoV-NL63 contacts ACE2 with three discontinuous beta-loops, whereas SARS-CoV binds the receptor through a continuous subdomain [53] (Figure 3B ). These observations suggest that the two viruses independently acquired the ability to bind the same ACE2 region via convergent evolution or that they shared an ACE2-binding ancestor long ago. Strikingly, TGEV, which is phylogenetically related to HCoV-NL63, uses two regions corresponding to the HCoV-NL63 beta-loops to bind a distinct cellular receptor, ANPEP ( Figure 1B , Figure 3B ) [54] . Finally, HCoV-229E, sharing sequence homology with HCoV-NL63 and TGEV ( Figure 1A) , binds ANPEP, but engages a region distinct from that bound by TGEV [55] . Overall, these data highlight the extraordinary plasticity of CoV RBDs, and their complex evolutionary dynamics whereby divergent evolution can be followed by convergent adaptation to the same receptor. This complexity is further expanded by the ability of some CoVs to use other cellular attachment molecules to complement the function of the RBD. Indeed, the S protein of HCoV-NL63 exploits heparan sulfate proteoglycans to adhere to host cells [56] . Interestingly, a similar ability to bind heparan sulfate can be gained by MHV with relatively few in vitro-acquired mutations in the S protein [57] . In line with the view that heparan sulfate is an aspecific receptor, the mutant MHV viruses display expanded host tropism [57] , highlighting the potential relevance of combinatorial receptor usage or receptor shifts for interspecies transmission.",

Field studies have contributed enormously to widen our knowledge on the diversity of CoVs hosted by different vertebrates, and epidemiological surveys have provided CoV sequences from distinct geographic areas and associated with different disease phenotypes. In parallel, resources have been created to store and mine these data (e.g., The Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource, ViPR [65] ). These advances have allowed tracing the evolutionary history of the large and complex CoV genomes to an unprecedented detail. The emerging picture indicates that CoV genomes display high plasticity in terms of gene content and recombination. The long CoV genome expands the sequence space available for adaptive mutation, and the spike protein can adapt with relative ease to exploit different cellular receptors. These features are likely to underlie the alarming propensity of CoVs for host jumps. Despite these advances, major challenges remain (see Outstanding Questions). Efforts to underscore the viral genetic determinants that favor interspecies transmission should be pursued as an effective strategy to prevent or prepare for future HCoV emergence. Can evolutionary information be applied to develop tools to predict which viruses have greater zoonotic potential and may result in the next epidemic?",

RELAX evaluates if selection on the test branches (bold) is relaxed (k < 1) or intensified (k > 1) compared to background branches. In the evolutionary analysis table the number of sequences differs from that in the tree because RELAX removes identical sequences. Evidence of positive selection was searched for using the M7/M8 'site models' from PAML (see Box 2) and with PARRIS. M7 and M8 represent the null and the positive selection models, respectively. A likelihood ratio test (with 2 degrees of freedom) was applied.(B) An amino acid alignment of rodent AKAP7 and four viral phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is shown. Amino acids are colored red if they are identical, orange if they have very similar properties. PDEs belonging to the 2H family are characterized by two H-F-[S/T]-F motifs (blue boxes), where F is a hydrophobic residue. The structure of rat AKAP7 (gray, PDB ID: 2VFK) is superimposed on MERS-CoV NS4b (green, model generated from 2VFK), MHV NS2a (cyan, PDB ID: 4Z5V), and Rotavirus A VP3 (yellow, PDB ID: 5AF2). Catalytic histidines are shown in red. (C) Sequence and membrane topology comparison of HCoV viroporins. Transmembrane regions (TM1-3) predicted by the TMHMM algorithm[90] are boxed in blue. The corresponding topology model for SARS-CoV ORF3A, HCoV-229E ORF4a (from the Inf-1 strain), and HCoV-NL63 ORF3 is shown. The topology model of HCoV-OC43 OFR5 was derived from recent data[34].",
