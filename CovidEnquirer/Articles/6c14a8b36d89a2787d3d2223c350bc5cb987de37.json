Objectives: This study examined the use of chemically modified siRNAs in a mouse model of allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Methods: Chemically modified siRNAs were designed and screened in a cell-based reporter assay. The most potent siRNAs were then screened in bone marrow-derived mast cells to demonstrate efficacy in primary cells. Results: A candidate siRNA was formulated and administered to sensitized mice just before airway challenge with allergen. Administration of the siRNA was shown to reduce airway resistance significantly in sensitized and challenged mice by 60%, whereas a control siRNA had no effect. Conclusion: These data demonstrate the effectiveness of introducing targeted siRNAs to prevent induction of allergen-induced airway dysfunction and suggest potential therapeutic applications.

Despite the introduction and modification of new and established asthma treatments, including inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers, and anti-IgE, a significant proportion of patients require additional therapy. As a result, there remains a continuing need for additional compounds that may function through novel mechanisms. Mouse models of allergic airway inflammation and AHR have been developed to characterize the potential cellular and molecular mediators that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the inflammatory and hyperresponsive state. 1 Although these models do not completely mimic the human disease state, they do provide a means by which to test the potential benefit of targeting disease mediators and exploring new therapeutic technologies.",

            "text": "Chemically modified siRNAs have several advantages over their unmodified counterparts. Chemical modifications can be used to stabilize siRNAs to serum nucleases, improve duration of effect, and reduce off-target effects. [9] [10] [11] Moreover, recent publications demonstrate that chemically modified siRNAs can be used to avoid the dsRNA-induced immune response associated with some unmodified siRNA sequences. 10, 12 The ability of certain unmodified siRNAs to elicit the production of inflammatory mediators, including IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-6, is of particular concern in respiratory and immunologic studies because many of the possible end-points are sensitive to the release of such cytokines. Several studies have shown that the introduction of chemical modifications can abolish dsRNA-induced cytokine production. 10, 12 Recent reports demonstrate that it is possible to identify potent siRNAs bearing 29 modifications on all, or nearly all, nucleotides. 12, 13 These modified siRNAs do not elicit a dsRNA-induced immune response, whereas unmodified siR-NAs of the same sequence induce the production of IFN-g, TNF-a and IL-6. 12 IL-13 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is associated with several aspects of inflammation and AHR. The key role of IL-13 in airway inflammation and AHR is illustrated by experiments in which mice treated with recombinant IL-13 develop eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion, and AHR. 14, 15 In contrast, interference with IL-13 or genetic elimination of IL-13 prevents development of AHR and eosinophilic inflammation. 16, 17 IL-13 acts through several mechanisms. The proinflammatory role of IL-13 is mediated through the induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and numerous chemokines (eotaxin, macrophage inflammatory protein-1a, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, and monocyte chemoattractant proteins) that serve to recruit and activate inflammatory cells. 18 However, some of the effects of IL-13 appear to be independent of inflammatory cell recruitment. Several studies suggest that IL-13 can induce AHR in the absence of inflammatory cells, [18] [19] [20] potentially through a direct effect on airway smooth muscle. 21 In addition to airway inflammation, IL-13 is involved in mucus secretion by the airway epithelium. IL-13 has also been implicated in subepithelial fibrosis and therefore may play a role in airway remodeling in chronic asthma. 22 The current study examined the consequences of administering a stabilized IL-13 siRNA to sensitized and challenged mice and showed the effectiveness of this approach in preventing the development of allergen-induced AHR.",

The polyethylenimine formulation has been shown to facilitate delivery of oligonucleotides to the lung 28 and was previously used in a study that demonstrated the ability of siRNAs to restrict influenza virus replication in mice. This dose corresponds to approximately 3 mg/kg, which is relatively low compared with doses used in other studies demonstrating siRNA efficacy in vivo. 2, 12, 13, 30 Nevertheless, it may be possible to observe an effect in vivo by using a lower dose delivered directly to the lungs. Previous studies suggest that chemically synthesized siRNAs reduced viral replication after intranasal delivery in mice. 5 More recent work has shown that siRNAs formulated in lipid nanoparticles show extensive lung exposure (half-life >9.0 hours) and are broadly distributed in mouse lungs after intratracheal instillation. 31 Although siRNA treatment leads to a reduction in lung resistance in vivo, there are significant questions to be addressed in future studies. Primary among these is the identification of the site or timing of siRNA action and an associated reduction in IL-13 mRNA and protein levels. Although the sequence specificity of the IL-13 siRNA was established in vitro and the siRNA effect on lung resistance was clearly sequence-dependent, a reduction in IL-13 was not observed in BAL immediately after lung function studies. This may reflect a more localized reduction in IL-13, potentially in or in close vicinity to the airway smooth muscle, which has recently been proposed to respond directly to IL-13. 21 IL-13 is also an essential contributor to the development of goblet cell metaplasia and mucus hyperproduction. The administration of the IL-13 siRNA did not affect these parameters. AHR and goblet cell metaplasia have been dissociated, 32 and it is also possible that the amounts of IL-13 required for goblet cell metaplasia are lower than required in the development of AHR. 33 Alternatively, there may be a temporary reduction in IL-13 that is critical for AHR but is later masked by the influx of inflammatory cells to the airways, which are also sources of IL-13. Because the number of infiltrating inflammatory cells may be a secondary response or dissociated from development of the AHR response, 34,35 they proceed unimpeded in face of IL-13 siRNA treatment.",

The data support the notion that siRNAmediated reduction of IL-13 can alter the course of development of alterations in airway function. Although further work is needed to determine the cells targeted by the IL-13 siRNA, we demonstrated an IL-13 sequence-dependent reduction in AHR in this model.
