Fox and Beaucage (1979) have shown that newly received cats may carry salmonellosis. Several of these dog and cat pathogens are also hazardous to humans. The zoonotic implications of dog and cat diseases are described in Chapter 22 on zoonoses. Typically, newly re ceived cats show signs of panleukopenia during the first week after arrival, and the respiratory disease complex is manifest during the second or subsequent weeks. Generally, random source cats must be quarantined and conditioned for 30-60 days to ensure that they are healthy, well-nourished, tractable, and adapted to confinement. their biological responses. Criteria for evaluating a caging sys tem have been identified (ILAR, 1978b) and include animal comfort as a primary consideration. Physical comfort includes such factors as keeping the animal dry, clean, and at an appro priate temperature; providing sufficient space to permit normal postural adjustments; avoiding unnecessary physical restraint; and preventing overcrowding. In addition, the primary en closure should be designed to facilitate effective sanitation and should be maintained in good repair. Finally, the enclosure should meet the investigator's research requirements.",

The most commonly used methods are the modified Knott's technique or the filter technique. They are usually repeated during the holding period to help ensure de tection of heartworm infection. Difficulties arise in detecting heartworm infestation when dogs harbor adult worms but are amicrofilaremic. These are called occult infections. The preva lence of occult infection has been reported to range between 10 and 60% (Rawlings et al., 1982) . Occult infection occurs in pr\u00e9paient infections, unisexual infections, or where adult worms have been rendered sterile with drugs used in heartworm treatment. In these three types of occult infection no microfilaria are produced. A fourth type, \"immune-mediated amicrofilaremia,\" occurs when microfilaria are produced by the adults but are rapidly cleared from the circulation, presum ably due to presence of anti-microfilarial antibody (Wong and Suter, 1979) . Currently there are several serologie methods being developed for detecting these antibodies or Dir of Ilaria /mmto-related antigens in the serum. For the most part, these tests are still being evaluated, and their sensitivity and specific ity has not been documented.

Programs for achieving these ob jectives vary widely in length and sophistication among re search facilities. Some programs hold cats for only 7-14 days prior to release to research projects. Most find that this period is insufficient because many cats will exhibit clinical signs of upper respiratory disease following a 14-day holding period. Typically, the respiratory disease complex spreads through a newly received group with a few cats continuing to show upper respiratory signs even after 14 days.

The physi cal examination following arrival should be directed toward selecting the healthiest, most vigorous cats for conditioning. It is usually not cost effective to proceed with diagnosis and treatment of cats that are ill on arrival or those that become ill during the first few days of the conditioning period. These ani mals should be euthanized. If the newly received cats from different sources have been housed together for several days then one can expect 10-40% mortality due to panleukopenia during the conditioning period. Vigorous fluid, antibiotic, and supportive treatment of individual cats that exhibit signs of panleukopenia is often not cost effective, and euthanasia should be considered. The feline respiratory disease complex affects many newly received cats. The complex consists primarily of feline viral rhinotrachetitis virus or feline calicivirus infection. These agents are readily transmitted among cats individually housed in a room, and often a majority of the animals within a group will have respiratory signs. The husbandry staff must observe the precautions outlined in Section IV,C or the disease will spread from room to room. The intensity of treatment depends on the severity of clinical signs and the length of time that the group has been conditioned. Animals that are nearing the end of the conditioning period are more valuable because of the accumulating costs of daily maintenance and conditioning pro cedures. Often it is not cost effective to institute extensive treatment and nursing care for respiratory disease during the early portion of the conditioning period since the cost of drugs, supplies, laboratory tests, and nursing care can quickly exceed the cost of a replacement animal. Animals that show extensive DANIEL H. RINGLER AND GREGORY K. PETER clinical signs early in the conditioning period should be eu thanized rather than treated.

Animal husbandry personnel should provide daily care for long-term stable animals early in the day, then proceed to care for conditioning animals next, then newly received animals later in the day.

Histopathologic studies have confirmed the diagnosis of canine distemper in most fatal infections (Binn et al., 1979) . It has also been shown that dogs seronegative to canine distemper virus or adenovirus are much more likely to succumb to respiratory disease during the condi tioning period (Binn et al., 1970b (Binn et al., , 1979 . In the later study, 74% of the dogs without protective antibody to canine dis temper developed respiratory disease, and 33% died. In con trast, only 24% of the dogs with protective antibody became ill and 4% died. Prevention of canine distemper appears to be the key to controlling severe, prolonged, and often fatal respirato ry disease. Newly arrived dogs that have antibody to canine distemper also have a prevalence of antibody to infectious ca nine hepatitis virus (canine adenovirus type 1) twice that of dogs seronegative to canine distemper virus (Binn et al., 1970b) . The parallel titers in all likelihood indicate that these dogs have been vaccinated with a bivalent vaccine. Doyle et al. (1979) found that immunization of newly re ceived random source dogs against canine distemper, infec tious canine hepatitis, and canine parainfluenza virus on arrival reduced the incidence of respiratory disease from 15 to 2% and the mortality from 16 to 6%. Appel (1970) has shown that to be effective, immunization against canine distemper must oc cur before exposure to virulent canine distemper virus occurs.",

Feline respiratory disease due to one or a combination of these agents is characterized by similar clinical signs, and clinical differentiation of them is not easy. Control of these infections is a difficult problem in research facilities just as it is in cat teries and veterinary hospitals.",

Young animals are more frequently clinically affected than adults. Baxter (1973) reports that 70% of clinically significant cases involve kittens, while only 30% involve adult cats. Adult cats, however, can serve as inapparent carriers.

The yellow-green color under fluorescent light is most evident on the intrafollicular portion of the short-stubble hairs. As with the Woods lamp, microscopic examination of hairs cleaned with po tassium hydroxide is rarely effective as the sole means of con firming the diagnosis. Fungal culture of the short-stubble hairs and skin biopsy are more definitive. Skin biopsy usually re veals acanthosis, parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, and an inflam matory infiltrate in the upper dermis. Special stains, such as methenamine silver, may facilitate visualization of spores and mycelia in the keratinized portion of the skin and/or the hair follicle (Fig. 7 ).",

Georgi et al. (1979) found that first stage larvae or embryonated eggs are infective and that coprophagy in puppies is the common route of transmission and auto-infection. In natural infections there are usually only a few worms within the pulmonary par enchyma and no clinical signs, but with concurrent stress, such as that encountered in some research projects, fulminating ver minous pneumonia can develop (August et al., 1980; Craig et al., 1978) . The major lesions caused by this parasite are focal granulomas in response to dead adult worms in the lungs. These lesions, although not life-threatening, may be confused microscopically with those produced by oncogenic agents, drugs, and other pathogenic organisms (Georgi, 1976) . Even subclinical lesions such as these are undesirable in animals used in research, since they may confound research results. Diagnosis can be accomplished by detecting larvae in feces with fecal flotation techniques using ZnS0 4 (specific gravity = 1.18) (Ehrenford, 1957) , or NaN0 3 (specific gravity = 1.2) (Appel, 1970) .

In animals, we have concluded that the incidence of septicemia due to catheter tract infection is very much dependent on the distance between the skin entry site and the vessel entry site. If the catheter has a relatively long subcutaneous course before entering the vein then there is less likelihood that infection at the skin entry site will result in septicemia. Peters et al. (1973) have shown that an intravascular fibrin sleeve develops around vascular catheters within 24-48 hr of implantation. This fibrin sleeve can become seeded with bacteria and serve as a locus from which septicemia can result.

A gas sterilized catheter is placed using asceptic surgical technique by personnel that have received training in these techniques. The catheter should be coated with a tridodecylmethyl ammonium chloride (TDMAC)-heparin com plex as described by Brenner et al. (1974) to reduce thrombogenesis. The TDMAC-heparin complex coating material is available from Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, Pennsylvania. Following placement, radiography should be utilized to ensure that the location of the catheter tip is correct. Prophylactic anti biotics should be administered one day before and for 3 days after surgery.",

These lesions and other as yci unidentified effects may have a significant impact on biological functions in cats used in biomedical research. Ladiges et al.
