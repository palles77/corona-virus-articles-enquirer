During the study a number of females died or failed to nurse their litters. This was so severe following the first mating of F~ adults that the animals were remated to provide the next generation. None of these effects were related to treatment. Body weight and food and water intakes were not adversely affected by treatment. No effects of treatment were seen on reproductive performance or foetal and pup development, apart from slight evidence of a treatment-related retarded ossification of the third sternebrae. Organ weights at autopsy showed two changes, one of which was increased kidney weights which, although not present in every generation, seemed to be related to treatment. The other, increased caecum weights, occurred in adult high-dose females of early generations, but not in males or later generations of the study. Apart from brown coloration of tissues, macroscopic and microscopic examination revealed no treatment-related changes. It was concluded that the no-untoward-effect level in the present study was 250 mg Brown HT/kg/day.",

Brown coloration of the Kupffer cells of the liver, the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney and the lymph nodes was also observed at dose levels above 0.5%. Hall et al.

An early metabolic study (Fore et al. 1967) showed that Brown HT was decolorized, and a number of other azo dyes (Walker, 1970) undergo azo-reductive fission, when incubated with rat-liver homogenates. Recently Phillips et al. (1987) have reported the presence of both Brown HT and its azo-reduced metabolite, naphthionic acid, in the faeces of rats, mice and guinea-pigs, whereas naphthionic acid was the only major metabolite detected in urine. Studies by Mallett et al. (1982) demonstrated that the metabolites of Brown HT incubated in a continuous culture of rat hind-gut microflora were virtually identical to those isolated from rat faeces by thin-layer chromatography. The major metabolite was again naphthionic acid.",

Weanling F0 rats were randomized into four groups for each sex and fed diets containing sufficient Brown HT to provide daily intakes of 0 (control), 50, 250 or 500mg/kg body weight. The six test groups each contained 36 rats and the untreated control groups 60 rats each. Mating of the F0 animals, to provide F~ litters, commenced after 60 days on the test diet. Pairs were selected from within each group by random techniques, with changes where necessary to avoid sibling matings. The first 24 females from the control group and 12 females from each of the three treatment groups to conceive were time-mated so that the date of coition was known (day of mating was designated day 0). These females were killed on day 20 of gestation for a gross autopsy and a detailed examination of the uterus and its contents. The foetuses were examined for external and visceral defects, weighed and preserved for examination of skeletal development. A gross post-mortem examination was performed on the males used for the timed matings, The remaining males and females were housed in pairs for 12 days (approximately three oestrous cycles) to allow mating. The males were then removed and the pregnant females were individually housed in solid-floored cages and allowed to deliver and rear their young. Survival, growth and development of the offspring were monitored over the first 21 days of life. After weaning, young males and females were randomly selected from the litters, either to constitute the next generation (F1) or for autopsy. Where possible, at least one male and one female were selected from each litter to provide equal numbers for the FI generation as were used for the F 0 generation. Distribution was such that the F~ mean weights were similar for each group. At the same time, where possible, one male and one female were chosen from each litter and killed at 33 + 2 days after birth and a full autopsy was carried out. A gross autopsy was performed on the remaining young rats. The F0 adult animals (random-mated) were killed and subjected to a full post-mortem examination.",

            "text": "The kidney weights of rats given the highest dose of Brown HT were consistently higher than those of the controls. An association with treatment is reinforced by the observation that these increases occurred only after a period of feeding and not in animals killed soon after weaning. In short-term feeding studies, Chambers et al. (1966) and Hall et al. (1966) found no significant change in the kidney weights of rats given approximately 500 mg Brown HT/kg body weight for 13 wk, but the latter group did find evidence of mild renal dysfunction (increased urinary glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activity) in both sexes at this dose level, and both studies reported significant increases in kidney weight at the highest dose level used (approximately 1000mg Brown HT/kg body weight). Carpanini et al. (1978) also reported an increase in the relative kidney weights of male rats fed approximately 500mg Brown HT/kg body weight for 2 yr. In a recent metabolic study (Phillips et al. 1987) it was shown that up to 20% of the radioactivity associated with a single, oral dose of 14C-labelled Brown HT was excreted in the urine, mainly (80%) in the form of naphthionic acid, and that most (70%) of this renal clearance was effected within 24 hr of dosing. From these findings, it is reasonable to assume that in feeding studies, where treatment is continuous, there is a continuous excretory load on the kidney. The slight increase in kidney weight may be simply an adaptive response to this increased excretory load, or may indicate a toxic effect of treatment. From our findings it was not possible to determine the relative contribution of these factors to the changes seen. The fact that no renal damage was detected on histological examination is strong evidence against nephrotoxicity. However, as Kluwe (1981) has pointed out, the absence of histological changes does not necessarily preclude injury. Brown HT and/or its metabolites have been shown to accumulate in the kidney (Chambers et al. 1966; Hall et al. 1966; Phillips et al. 1987 ) and, although rapidly cleared upon cessation of treatment (Phillips et al. 1987) , may exert a mild toxic effect while present.",

The number of corpora lutea in each ovary was recorded together with the number and position of foetuses and resorptions in each uterine horn, foetal viability and the presence of any visible foetal malformations. The resorptions were classified as early or late depending on the presence or absence of visible foetal tissue. Each viable foetus was weighed, preserved in 95% alcohol and identified according to position in the uterine horn. After fixation in alcohol, the foetuses were eviscerated, the eyes and brown fat overlying the scapulae were removed, and the sex was determined. The ossified parts of the eviscerated foetuses were stained with Alizarin Red S by a method based on that described by Staples & Schnell (1964), and examined for skeletal abnormalities and variations in the degree of ossification.Physical and neurological development of litters.Dams and their litters were inspected daily for the first 21 days of life. The date of parturition was recorded and litter survival was calculated as the percentage of live pups born that survived to day 7, 14 and 21 after birth. Litters were weighed on day 7, 14 and 21 and the sex of the pups was verified. Several indicators of physical and neurological development were also monitored during the first 21 days of life.The tests used and the criteria for a positive observation of physical development were as follows: eye opening, one or both eyes fully opened; ears uncurled, one or both pinna fully unfolded; tooth eruption, one or more incisors visible above the gums; hair growth, a coat of fine fur covering the body. The tests used and criteria for a positive observation of auditory and neuromuscular development were:",
