Passage through the basement membrane (BM), a 50-100-nm-thick crucial barrier underlying epithelia and endothelia, is a prerequisite for successful host invasion. Such passage allows pathogens to reach nerve endings or blood vessels in the stroma and to facilitate spread to internal organs. During evolution, several pathogens have developed different mechanisms to cross this dense matrix of sheet-like proteins. To breach the BM, some microorganisms have developed independent mechanisms, others hijack host cells that are able to transverse the BM (e.g. leukocytes and dendritic cells) and oncogenic microorganisms might even trigger metastatic processes in epithelial cells to penetrate the underlying BM.",

Generally, adhesion of bacteria and fungi occurs through binding of adhesive molecules, called adhesins, to host proteins. Most adhesins are extensively described and some of the motifs participating in these processes have been identified. In comparison, knowledge about adhesion of viruses to BM components is scarce. On adhesion, microorganisms have evolved cunning techniques to overcome the BM barrier, which otherwise hampers their invasive process. Breakdown of the BM, via activation of microbial and/or host proteases, to cross the BM has been shown for many bacteria, fungi and, recently, some viruses. Pathogens might also gain access to the connective tissue by hijacking host cells, particularly local immune cells, to cross the BM. This review provides an overview of recent insights into different pathogen-BM interactions during host invasion, discusses these findings and projects how they could contribute to the design of novel strategies to interfere with microbial invasions and pathology.",

            "text": "The BM: a specialized extracellular matrix possessing unique properties The BM provides a subtle interface between epithelial or endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells present in connective tissue. Besides providing tissue structure, the BM plays an important role in structural integrity, cell behavior and signaling [1] . In proximity to epithelial cells, BM components such as collagen XVII and laminin 5, 6 and 10 are linked to extracellular parts of different molecules, mainly belonging to the integrin family (e.g. a6b4, a5b1 and a9b1) and fibronectin network, present on basolateral cell surfaces. At the cellular-matrix interface, located underneath the cell-neighboring elements collagen IV, VII and XVIII, laminin 1, entactin/nidogen, BM-40/osteonectin, fibulins and proteoglycans such as bamacan, agrin, perlecan are abundant. Towards the lamina propria, collagen I, III, V and VI appear next to proteoglycans. Overall, the BM represents a firm network of the main components, collagen and laminin, bridged by various other components ( Figure 1 ). Importantly, the average pore size in the collagen-laminin network is approximately 50 nm, which allows only very small particles to diffuse across this thin but firm barrier [2, 3] . This implies that microorganisms have devised ways to cross the BM.",

            "text": "Adhesion of pathogens to BM components A crucial initial event in the pathogenesis of many microorganisms is adhesion to host tissues. Major players during these early steps in infection are microbial adhesive cellsurface molecules, termed adhesins [4] . Microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) are adhesins that attach to extracellular matrix (ECM) including the BM. Many MSCRAMMs are capable of binding more than one ECM component, and a single strain often possesses several different proteins that bind the same host component. Although current data about viral ECM adhesion and adhesins are still scarce, their importance in virulence has been shown for most bacteria and many fungi. For example, in many animal models of staphylococcal infections, CNA, a collagen-binding adhesin of pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus, increases disease severity. It has been suggested that the ability to interact with collagen grants these bacteria a clear advantage in pathogenesis [5] . For bacteria, adhesins are roughly subdivided according to the appendage morphology: there are fimbrial or non-flagellar adhesins (chaperone-usher pili, curli, type IV pili, type III secretion needle and type IV secretion pili) and non-fimbrial adhesins (autotransporters; outer membrane, secreted and biofilm-associated adhesins). Pili are further classified according to physical properties, antigenic determinants, adhesion characteristics, and characteristics of the major protein subunits or assembly pathways [6, 7] . Although adhesins form a heterogeneous group with diverse architecture, domain content and binding mechanism, some do possess similarity in structure, ECM-binding domain organization and function [8, 9] . ECM-binding MSCRAMMs of many pathogenic Gram-positive species are cell-wall-anchored surface proteins (CWPs). Common features of CWPs are an N-terminal signal peptide followed by a so-called A region or domain, segments of repeated domains and a characteristic C-terminal sorting signal. The sorting signal contains an important cell-wall-anchoring site or LPXTG motif, which covalently binds to the cell wall [10, 11] . However, it has recently been shown that the collagen-binding adhesin Slr of Gram-positive Streptococcus pyogenes lacks the LPXTG motif, but uses a cell-wall-anchoring TLIA lipobox instead [12] . The structure and organization of viral and fungal adhesins to ECM are less well documented at present, although there is proof of diversity in fungal adhesins [8, 13] . Some fungal adhesins show structural and/or functional similarities to bacterial adhesins [8, 13] . Agglutinin-like sequence (Als) adhesins of Candida albicans are composed of a signal peptide, an N-terminal region, a nonrepeat Thr-rich (TR) region, a central region with a variable number of repeats, and a Ser/Thr/Asn-rich C-terminal domain that anchors the CWP via a glycophosphatidyl inositol (GPI) remnant [13, 14] . In many cases, ECM-binding domains recognize carbohydrate residues or oligosaccharides, but not exclusively, because many of them also bind host protein-binding sites [10, 15, 16] . Besides this direct microbial adhesin-ligand binding, microorganisms have developed other interesting indirect adhesive approaches. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. prevent cell detachment of infected cells from the BM through stabilization of focal adhesions. This strategy counteracts rapid exfoliation, which is an effective intrinsic defensive system of intestinal epithelium [17] . C. albicans promotes laminin 5 and type IV collagen protein secretion to enhance binding to the BM [18] . In the following paragraphs, adhesion of bacteria, fungi and viruses to the major BM components collagen, laminin, proteoglycans, entactin/nidogen, BM-40 and fibulin is discussed in more detail. Bacteria, fungi and viruses also show binding capacity to fibronectin, a minor component of the BM zone, that is extensively described elsewhere [19] .",

Regulation of ECM-degrading enzymes aids pathogens in invading deeper tissues, thereby enhancing dissemination throughout the host.

            "text": "Various bacterial pathogens including Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens [42] encode or modulate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Other bacteria degrade the BM barrier by encoding or modulating serine proteases. Indeed, many bacterial pathogens, such as Enterobacteriaceae, Fusobacteriaceae, Helicobacteriaceae, Legionellaceae, Mycobacteriaceae, Neisseriaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Spirochaetaceae, Staphylococcaceae and Streptococcaceae, modulate the plasminogen (Plg)-plasmin system [43] and the structural and functional aspects of this system are described elsewhere [44] . In brief, through the activity of the two main physiological plasminogen activators, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen is converted to plasmin, which degrades laminin and fibronectin and activates precursors of MMPs. Several bacterial pathogens express plasminogen receptors, thereby recruiting plasminogen to the bacterial surface, which leads to enhanced plasminogen activation. In addition, some bacteria bind and/or induce uPA or tPA [43, 45] and/or express bacterial plasminogen activators. Moreover, some bacteria inactivate plasmin inhibitors [46] . Some bacterial species modulate multiple proteases to cross the BM. In addition to modulating the Plg system, Streptococcus pyogenes also expresses a cysteine protease [47] . Fusobacterium nucleatum can invade the BM in a strain-dependent manner by binding plasminogen [48] and pro-MMP9 and stimulating MMP9 and MMP13 secretion [49] . Helicobacter pylori induces expression of the cysteine protease cathepsin X in gastric epithelial cells and macrophages. In epithelial cells, H. pylori induces morphological and motility changes, partly via MMP9 [50] and probably also via other proteases. The mechanisms by which H. pylori induces expression of proteases in epithelial cells and macrophages is unknown. It has been suggested that proteolytic activities play a role in gastric tumorigenesis [50] . H. pylori also increases expression of the uPA system in gastric epithelial cells [51] . Mycobacterium tuberculosis [18, 52] and Neisseria meningitidis [45, 53] modulate both MMPs (MMP8 and MMP9, respectively) and the plasminogen-plasmin system. Both morphotypes of Peptostreptococcus micros possess plasminogen receptors. For P. micros, both bacterial (streptokinase) and human plasminogen activators (uPA) can activate plasminogen to plasmin. Rough morphotypes also possess chymotrypsinlike and gelatinase serine proteases [54] . Porphyromonas gingivalis upregulates MMPs, modulates the plasminogen-plasmin system and expresses cysteine protease gingipains. Gingipains contribute to BM penetration, either directly or by modulating MMP2 and MMP9 [55] . Pseudomonas aeruginosa expresses an MMP and modulates the plasminogen-plasmin system [56] . Treponema pallidum expresses an MMP-like and serine protease [57] , induces MMPs and modulates the plasminogen-plasmin system [43] . Vibrio spp. express both MMPs and serine proteases [58] .",

The glycoprotein K1 of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) modulates the production of MMP1, MMP2 and MMP9 [68] . Apart from the involvement of viral-induced proteolytic activities in EBV-, hepatitis B virus-, HPV-and KSHV-induced metastasis, it is unclear at present whether this induction plays a role in viral pathogenesis. A similar mechanism is observed in human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-1)-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, in which MMP9 expression is increased in HTLV-1-infected malignant cells [69, 70] . HTLV-I encephalitis is associated with MMP2 and MMP9 [70] . Other viral infections have also been implicated in neurological conditions because of their involvement in BBB impairment by damaging the vascular BM. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) induces collagenase type IV secretion, which may lead to BM degradation and subsequent release of infected endothelial cells into the circulation and access into the CNS [71] . Viral hijacking of immune cells might also modulate vascular permeability. Bunyaviridae (Andes virus, ANDV), Dengue virus, HIV and West Nile virus (WNV) enhance dendritic cell (DC) maturation, MMP9 expression and plasma vascular leakage [72] . MMP9 is also upregulated in both the periphery and brain on WNV infection and is partly localized to brain blood vessels. WNV may enter the brain directly through the BBB or may be carried within infected leukocytes (described in the next section). WNV also upregulates MMP1 and MMP3 [73] . Coronaviruses can also induce MMPs in susceptible cells and have been associated with multiple sclerosis-like disease in rodents. However, the role of MMPs in coronavirus CNS infection is unknown [74] . Finally, it has been postulated that bovine herpesvirus 5 (BHV-5) entry the CNS is facilitated by leukocytes and MMP9. However, induction of MMP9 expression by BHV-5 has not been directly demonstrated so far [75] .",

Then these protrusions elongate in the degraded zone and infiltrate the underlying compartment. It is believed that the rod-like shape of invadopodia allows for focal delivery of proteases to restrictive areas of the BM [77] . Although the primary function of immune cells is to sample pathogens to initiate an immune response, over time, several pathogens have developed mechanisms to use these cells as Trojan horses to cross the BM barrier and disseminate throughout the host.

Early in the course of infection, HIV-1 can enter the CNS. HIV encephalitis is characterized by HIV-laden monocytes and macrophage infiltration into CNS parenchyma. Local inflammation and HIV products such as gp120, Nef and Tat, which upregulate MMP2 and/or MMP9, lead to breaches in the BBB late in HIV CNS disease. This enables free virions to enter the brain [95, 96] . In addition, CMVinfected monocytes can enter the CNS in a Trojan horse model [78] . For WNV, LCs support initial viral replication, followed by replication in lymphoid tissues and dissemination to organs and the CNS [97] ; WNV may enter the brain through the BBB either directly or carried within infected monocytes or macrophages (as described above) [73] .",

EHV-1-infected monocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes were found in connective tissue below the BM in close proximity to epithelial plaques, suggestive of leukocyte-mediated viral passage through the BM [98] . The closely related EHV-4 did not efficiently infect these local immune cells, which might be the reason why EHV-4-induced viremia is rare [98] . It has been postulated that BHV-5 might use a similar invasive mechanism as EHV-1 and that BHV-5 entry into the CNS is facilitated by leukocytes and MMP9 [75] . Lymphocytemediated viral entry into the brain has also been demonstrated for HTLV-1 [70] . The association with MMP activity was described earlier.",

However, it is clear that a wide array of pathogens have developed mechanisms to cross the BM and invade the host. There are several important outstanding questions about this still largely unexplored topic (Box 1). One aspect of BM passage that we have not discussed here is the role of local immunity in breaking down ECM during a microbial infection. Indeed, immune cells produce a large amount of proteases on stimulation at sites of inflammation and this might rupture important barriers such as the BM, allowing pathogens access to deeper tissues. However, inflammation increases the risk that pathogens will be neutralized by the immune system.",

Moreover, it is important to know that different microbial invasive strategies might have synergistic effects on one another. Indeed, interactions between adhesion and proteolytic activity-mediating mechanisms to improve and enhance pathogen invasion have been described [99] . In some bacteria, production of proteases might even depend on quorum sensing [100] . Taking this possibility into account, hampering of bacterial adhesion might also influence proteolytic activity. Mechanisms underpinning binding to and breakdown of the BM are generally better understood for bacteria and fungi than for viruses. Hence, it will be interesting to identify possible viral factors that are required for efficient penetration through the BM and ECM. If protease activity plays a role, as described recently for a herpesvirus [76] , then the use of protease inhibitors might be a useful strategy. However, to further develop the potential of proteases as antimicrobial targets, there is a need for identification of all signals, factors and domains involved during microbial invasion. Compounds that interfere with pathogen hijacking of migratory cells or limit interactions of metastatic cells with ECM elements could, if locally applied, provide an interesting way to prevent or delay further microbial invasion.",

The other components of the BM interact with the laminin polymer and the type IV collagen network to organize a functional BM on the basolateral aspect of cells. (c) Despite the small pore size of the BM, immune cells scanning for signs of infection routinely traverse it. The BM transmigration program is a conserved mechanism.

(d) Finally, viruses may spread in the host by reaching blood or lymph vessels.",
