The origin and virulence of this novel porcine coronavirus are not known. Here, we characterized U.S. PdCV isolates and determined their virulence in gnotobiotic and conventional piglets. Genome analyses revealed that U.S. PdCV isolates possess unique genetic characteristics and share a close relationship with Hong Kong and South Korean PdCV strains and coronaviruses (CoVs) of Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret-badgers. The PdCV-positive intestinal content (Ohio CVM1) and the cell culture-adapted PdCV Michigan (MI) strain were orally inoculated into gnotobiotic and/or conventional piglets. Within 1 to 3 days postinfection, profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration were observed. Clinical signs were associated with epithelial necrosis in the gastric pits and small intestine, the latter resulting in severe villous atrophy. Mild interstitial pneumonia was identified in the lungs of PdCVinfected piglets. High levels of viral RNA (8 to 11 log RNA copies/g) were detected in intestinal tissues/luminal contents and feces of infected piglets, whereas moderate RNA levels (2 to 5 log RNA copies/g) were detected in blood, lung, liver, and kidney, indicating multisystemic dissemination of the virus.",

We found that PdCV caused severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in gnotobiotic and conventional piglets, signs that were clinically indistinguishable from those caused by PEDV and TGEV. In addition to extensive intestinal lesions, PdCV caused significant lesions in the stomach and mild pulmonary lesions that have not been reported for TGEV and PEDV.

Since 2009, avian deltacoronaviruses have been detected in a wide range of domestic and wild birds (15) (16) (17) . The porcine deltacoronaviruses (PdCV) Hong Kong (HK) strains HKU15-155 and HKU15-44 were recently detected in rectal swabs from pigs (15) . The potential of the HKU15-155 and HKU15-44 PdCVs to cause significant clinical disease in swine is not known. In mid-January 2014, PdCV was identified in fatal cases of PEDV-negative diarrhea in Ohio piglets (18) . Field reports document a history and clinical presentation (vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration) typical of TGEV and PEDV; like for the other swine enteric CoVs, morbidity and mortality rates at PdCV-infected farms are high (18) (19) (20) (21) . In some instances, PdCV is the only virus recovered from these diarrhea outbreaks; in others, it may be present as a coinfection with PEDV. To date, outbreaks have been documented in more than 20 states in the United States. In April 2014, a PdCV strain (KOR/KNU14-04/2014) was also identified in feces from diarrheic piglets in South Korea (22) .",

Although the virus is identified in diarrhea outbreaks, experimental studies that directly demonstrate its diseasecausing potential remain to be shown. The objective of this study is to characterize the U.S. PdCV isolate in terms of genetic characteristics, phylogeny, and virulence in gnotobiotic (Gn) and con-ventional piglets. Genomic sequencing found that U.S. PdCV strains share 99.6 to 99.7% homology with each other and 99.0 to 99.1% homology with Hong Kong isolates (HKU15-155 and HKU15-44). We found that the U.S. PdCV strains caused severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration clinically indistinguishable from those caused by PEDV and TGEV. Histologically, the PdCV strains caused severe lesions in the stomach and small intestine and mild interstitial pneumonia in lungs. Collectively, our study provides the first proof that PdCV causes significant enteric disease in swine.",

Total RNA was extracted from these samples and subjected to reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Results showed that these samples were positive for PdCV but negative for PEDV, TGEV, and PRCV (Fig. 1A) . Feces and intestinal contents were filtered and subsequently analyzed by electron microscopy. Typical coronaviruslike particles with diameters ranging from 60 to 180 nm were observed ( Fig. 1B and C) . No other viral particles were observed. Subsequently, the filtered duodenum contents were subjected to deep sequencing. No other known viral sequences were identified, Complete genome sequence of PdCV Ohio CVM1. The genomic sequence of PdCV Ohio CVM1 is 25,422 nucleotides (nt) in length, excluding the 3= poly(A) tail, which is 1 nt and 6 nt longer than those of the PdCV Hong Kong strains HKU15-44 and HKU15-155, respectively. The genome organization of PdCV Ohio CVM1 is typical of CoVs. Starting from the 5= end, approximately three-fourths of the viral genome encodes two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), producing up to 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP). Downstream of ORF1, PdCV contains six additional ORFs (ORF2 to ORF7) that code for the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), and NS7. Similar to avian deltacoronaviruses, NS6 is located between M and N. However, ORF7 (NS7) of PdCV differs from that of avian deltacoronaviruses. NS7 of PdCV overlaps with the N protein, whereas avian deltacoronaviruses contain 2 to 4 additional ORFs that encode NS7a, NS7b, NS7c, and NS7d, which overlap or are downstream of the N protein (15, 17) . Both 5= and 3= ends of PdCV contain short untranslated regions (UTR) with lengths of 539 and 395 nt, respectively. The genome of Ohio CVM1 shares 99% and 99.1% identity with Hong Kong PdCV strains HKU15-44 and HKU15-155, representing 249-and 206-nt differences, respectively. Compared to the HKU15-44 strain, PdCV Ohio CVM1 has a 1-nt (T) insertion at position 25267 located at the 3= UTR. PdCV Ohio CVM1 also differs by having a 3-nt (AAT) insertion at positions 19477 to 19479, which encodes the N terminus of the S protein, and a 3-nt (GTT) insertion at positions 25047 to 25049, located at the 3= UTR.",

The genomic sequence of PdCV Ohio CVM1 shares 99.6 to 99.7% identity with other U.S. PdCV isolates and 99.7% homology with a South Korean isolate (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The South Korean strain shares more homology with U.S. strains than Hong Kong strains. Within U.S. PdCV isolates, PdCV Ohio CVM1 shares the highest identity (99.8%) with the OH1987, PA3148, and IL2768 strains, with only 41-, 52-, and 58-nt differences, respectively, across the entire genome. A total of 94 nt differences, accounting for 14 unique amino acid changes, were found between the U.S. PdCV strains and the two Hong Kong strains. Specifically, 10 amino acids (F1019, I1320, I1414, V1483, I1647, I3120, F5442, V5816, H5871, and E5875) in ORF1ab were found to be unique to the U.S. isolates. In addition, 4 amino acids (V551, I670, S698, and I1016) were found to be unique to the S proteins of all known U.S. isolates. These unique amino acids can potentially serve as genetic markers to discriminate between U.S. and Hong Kong strains. Notably, HKU15-155 has a 1-amino-acid deletion at position 52 in the S protein, whereas all other strains have \"N\" at this position. Interestingly, all the U.S., Hong Kong, and South Korean strains share 100% identity in the E protein (see Table S1 ). Amino acid sequences of M proteins are identical in all strains, with the exception of an A83P substitution in HKU15-155.

Sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide sequences of the N and NS7 genes of PdCV Ohio CVM1 share higher homology with those of Hong Kong strain HKU15-44 than all other U.S. strains. Four continuous nucleotides (405C, 534C, 558A, and 564A) in the N gene are unique to Hong Kong strain HKU15-44 and the Ohio CVM1 strain (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The corresponding nucleotides in all other U.S. strains are 405T, 534A, 558G, and 564G, all of which are silent mutations for N protein. However, the first three nucleotide changes result in 3 amino acid substitutions in the protein encoded by the NS7 gene, which overlaps with the N gene (see Fig. S1 ). Specifically, the shared amino acids in the predicted NS7 protein sequence of the Ohio CVM1 and Hong Kong strains are P104, P147, and N155, whereas all other U.S. strains at the same positions have L, Q, and S, respectively. Importantly, all other viral protein genes of Ohio CVM1 share higher homology with genes of other U.S. strains than with genes of the Hong Kong strain. This finding suggests that Ohio CVM1 may represent a recombinant strain in which the NS7 gene is derived from Hong Kong strains and the rest of the genome is derived from the U.S. strains. In addition, PdCV Ohio CVM1 has six other unique amino acid changes across the genome. M5309 and R5354 were unique for ORF1ab, I553 and K642 were unique for S protein, and S24 was unique for N protein.",

Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method in the MEGA 6 program using 11 U.S. PdCV strains, two Hong Kong PdCV strains, one South Korean PdCV strain, and nine avian deltacoronavirus strains. Sequence BLAST found that CoVs from Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret-badgers also belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus, for which partial genomic sequences encoded by the 3CLpro, RdRp, Hel, S, and N genes are available (23) . Thus, known viral protein genes of Asian leopard cat and Chinese ferret-badger CoVs were included in the phylogenetic analysis. All U.S. PdCV strains, together with two Hong Kong strains, HKU15-44 and HKU15-155, and one Korean strain, fell into one cluster, forming the PdCV group ( Fig. 2A ). PdCV shares a closer relationship with other mammal deltacoronaviruses (i.e., Asian leopard cat and Chinese ferret-badger CoVs) than with avian deltacoronaviruses. This suggests that porcine, feline, and avian deltacoronaviruses may have a common ancestor ( Fig. 2A) . Similarly, PdCV shares higher homology with Asian leopard cat CoVs than with avian deltacoronaviruses in the phylogenetic tree analysis when the N, M, E, and NS6 protein gene sequences are used (data not shown). In addition, the phylogenetic tree of the NS7 protein gene showed that PdCV Ohio CVM1 is more closely related to HKU15-44 and HKU15-155 than to other U.S. PdCV strains (Fig. 2B) .",

Many mucosal epithelial cells were necrotic and lysed; nuclear changes consistent with cell death included pyknosis, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis (Fig. 3G ). Epithelium-origin syncytial giant cells were still evident but were fewer in number. In the stomach (Fig. 3E ), occasional dilated gastric pits were observed, presumably created as individual PdCVinfected cells lysed and were replaced by attenuated, immature squamoid epithelial cells. The underlying lamina propria was edematous and contained activated macrophages, occasional aggregates of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and a scattering of eosinophils. These modest inflammatory cell infiltrates were attributable to PdCV, as inflammatory cell infiltrates are notably absent in uninfected Gn swine. Peyer's patches of the ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes were moderately depleted of lymphocytes, as were mesenteric lymph nodes. As is typical of Gn swine, lymphoid follicles (i.e., sites of B-cell differentiation) were either not present or present only as inactive aggregates of lymphocytes.",

            "text": "Interestingly, disease associated with PdCV has not been reported in China and other Asian countries in spite of being geographically closer to Hong Kong than is the United States. In 2012, Woo et al. analyzed a total of 169 pig rectal swabs, 17 of which were positive for PdCV HKU15 (15) . However, clinical signs were not described in their study. Aside from Woo's study, further outbreaks of HKU15-associated diseases in pigs have not been documented in Hong Kong and Asia, raising the possibility that HKU15 may not be a significant pathogen within its region of origin. Since PEDV is the dominant enteric disease in Asia and PdCV causes clinical signs indistinguishable from those of PEDV, it is also possible that clinically significant PdCV-induced disease has been overlooked. In contrast to the Asian experience, U.S. PdCV strains are associated with significant mortality (40 to 60%) in the field (18) (19) (20) and severe clinical disease and pathological changes in experimentally infected Gn and conventional piglets of the present study. In April 2014, PdCV was first identified in feces from diarrheic piglets in South Korea (22) . The PdCV South Korean strain is more (99.7% homology) closely related to U.S. isolates than Hong Kong strains, suggesting that the South Korean strain may be virulent to piglets. Sequence analysis in the current work suggests that U.S. PdCV originated from Hong Kong strains. Unique amino acid substitutions exist in U.S. PdCV isolates that may account for the increased virulence of this virus in U.S. swine, a possibility that should be addressed in future studies.",

In general, CoVs have high mutation rates and can easily undergo recombination and deletion events that lead to altered tissue tropism, transmission routes, and host specificity. Birds are reservoirs for avian deltacoronaviruses (15) (16) (17) . These avian deltacoronaviruses may adapt and jump to some mammalian species. Interestingly, the first mammalian source of deltacoronavirus was detected in rectal swabs of Asian leopard cats at live-animal markets in Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces in China (23) . It was found that 2.4% of Asian leopard cats (35 out of 1,453 samples) were positive for deltacoronavirus. It was also found that 1.1% of Chinese ferretbadgers (11 out of 934 samples) were also positive for deltacoronavirus, which shares 100% homology with the Asian leopard cat CoV based on the RdRp domain and the S gene sequence (23) . Interestingly, the PdCVs of both Hong Kong strains and U.S. isolates share more homology with deltacoronaviruses of Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret-badgers than avian deltacoronaviruses, suggesting that Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferretbadgers are intermediates for interspecies transmission of PdCV. At this time, we do not know if deltacoronaviruses are present in U.S. bird populations or other U.S. mammals (such as domestic cats). Clearly, a better understanding of the origin and evolution of the U.S. PdCV will await the detailed epidemiological study of deltacoronaviruses in the birds and mammals in the United States.",

The pathogenesis of TGEV and PEDV is well studied. Both TGEV and PEDV are members of the Alphacoronavirus genus and cause almost identical clinical signs and gross and histological lesions in young, susceptible pigs (6, 12, 24, 26) , even though there is no serological cross-reactivity between TGEV and PEDV. In contrast, PdCV is a member of the genus Deltacoronavirus most closely related to avian CoVs (15) . The overall clinical disease associated with PdCV infection is very similar to that induced by TGEV and PEDV, except that vomiting is more commonly seen in PdCV-infected piglets and the mortality rates are reported to be lower (on the order of 40 to 50%) than those for PEDV and TGEV (90 to 100%). Similar to TGEV and PEDV, PdCV replicates extensively in the small intestine. High levels of genomic RNA were detected in feces, intestinal contents, and tissues. A large number of antigen-positive cells were detected in all sections of the small intestine. Intestinal gross and histologic findings in PdCV-infected piglets are similar to those described for PEDV and TGEV. Finally, moderate levels of PdCV RNA were detected in blood and extraintestinal tissues, consistent with viremic dissemination similar to what has been observed in TGEVand PEDV-infected piglets.",

First, PdCV infection causes epithelial lesions in the glandular pits of the stomach. To our knowledge, involvement of gastric mucosal epithelial cells is not reported for either TGEV or PEDV. There is one report documenting gastric lesions associated with CoV RNAs in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-convalescent human patients, establishing a precedent for findings (28) . Second, PdCV infection is associated with mild interstitial pneumonia, evident in formalin-inflated lungs. In this regard, mild and ill-defined interstitial lesions in pulmonary parenchyma suggest that PdCV may have an unrecognized PRCV-like respiratory component. Modest amounts PdCV viral RNA were found in lung tissue homogenates, and PdCV antigen was detected in bronchial mucosal epithelial cells. Pathological changes in the lung have not been reported for PEDV and TGEV.",

For example, PRCV, a deletion mutant of TGEV, shifted the tissue tropism from intestine to lung (4, 29) . Tropism for both respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts is also a feature of SARS-CoV. Although the respiratory tract is the main target for SARS-CoV infection, outbreaks in human patients were associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, and SARS-CoV was detected in the stool samples (30) (31) (32) . Subsequent histologic characterization found that intestinal epithelia and mucosal lymphoid tissue are infected by SARS virus (30, 31) . In contrast to SARS-CoV and PRCV, the gastrointestinal tract is the primary target for PdCV, whereas the respiratory tract is the minor target. PdCV shares the highest genomic homology with avian deltacoronaviruses, all of which were originally detected from the gastrointestinal tract via rectal swabs (15) (16) (17) . Presumably, all these avian deltacoronaviruses were capable of replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, although it is not known if infection also involves a respiratory component. Further studies on this important point are urgently needed, particularly in light of the SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) experiences in humans.",

Clinically, Ohio CVM1 caused more severe disease in Gn piglets than the cell-adapted MI strain, despite the fact that the inoculation dose of Ohio CVM1 (10 6 genomic RNA copies) was less than that of the MI strain (10 6 PFU, equivalent to 10 9 genomic RNA copies). The reduced virulence of the MI strain may reflect a degree of attenuation secondary to cell culture adaptation. PdCV MI caused more severe disease in conventional piglets than in Gn piglet at the same inoculation dose. Conventional piglets developed severe sudden-onset diarrhea (score of 3) on day 1 p.i., whereas Gn piglets required 2 days of incubation time to develop diarrhea (score of 2). This finding raises the possibility that the gut microbial flora in conventional piglets facilitates development of diarrhea upon PdCV infection. The contributions of gut microflora or other physiological factors to virus-induced diarrhea are also supported by the finding that the severity of diarrhea in conventional piglets was not correlated with the kinetics of viral RNA shedding in feces (Fig. 8) . Findings in the current study also indicate that PdCV is highly transmissible among Gn piglets, most likely via aerosolized particles. Two uninoculated Gn piglets developed typical clinical signs and shed high levels of virus in feces despite the fact that they were physically separated from three virus-inoculated piglets. Viral RNA was detected in feces and in the ileum at day 21 p.i., suggesting that PdCV can be persistent in conventional piglets for a long time period, a fact that would enhance the potential for viral transmission. Collectively, these data demonstrated that PdCV is highly virulent and transmissible in piglets.",

The total RNA was extracted by using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription (RT) was conducted using a primer (5= TTTT GCTCCATCCCCCCTATAAGC 3=) targeting the 3=-end UTR of PdCV and the Superscript III transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The RT products were then used to perform real-time PCR using primers and probes specifically targeting the N gene of PdCV (forward, 5= CGCTTAA CTCCGCCATCAA 3=; reverse, 5= TCTGGTGTAACGCAGCCAGTA 3=; probe, 5= 6FAM-CCCGTTGAAAACC-MGB 3= [6FAM is 6-carboxyfluorescein] [Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA]) in a StepOne realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems). A standard plasmid for PdCV was constructed by inserting the sequence of the entire PdCV N gene into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI).

The threshold for detection of fluorescence above the background was set within the exponential phase of the amplification curves. For each assay, 10-fold dilutions of standard plasmid were generated, and negativecontrol samples and double-distilled water (ddH 2 O) were included in each assay.",
