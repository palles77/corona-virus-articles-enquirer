            "text": "By far and away the most important pulmonary diseases in humans are related to the smoking of tobacco. However, occupational lung diseases caused by inhalation of industrial chemicals, particulate matter and antigens, are also important causes of morbidity and mortality. For this reason, considerable effort has been directed to the examination of airborne pollutants over recent years, including study of their effects in laboratory animals when administered by the inhalation route. Extensive study has shown that a complex array of defensive mechanisms protects the lung against the adverse effects of airborne substances and pathogenic organisms. Aerodynamic factors prevent access of particles larger than 10|im diameter for these are deposited on the walls of the nasal passages. Particles measuring between 2 and 10 (im diameter tend to be trapped by the mucus-covered ciliated epithelium lining the bronchial tree and removed by mucociliary transport aided by the cough reflex. Smaller particles may reach the alveoli where they are ingested and transported by pulmonary macrophages.^ Considerations of airborne delivery to the lungs are also important in the development of therapies to be administered via the respiratory tract. Whilst the inhalation route has been used for many years for volatile anaesthetic gases, the respiratory tract is increasingly being employed for delivery of therapy in not only for asthma and other lung diseases but also as a means of systemic delivery of polypeptides such as insulin.",

However, drug-induced pulmonary disease appears to be an increasingly frequent clinical problem and the drugs associated with parenchymal pulmonary injury in humans continue to increase.^ Although it is difficult to assess in the context of the underlying disease process, it has been suggested that about 10% of patients receiving wellestablished anticancer drugs develop various forms of pulmonary toxicity Some novel antineoplastic therapies may have a similar liability.^ Drug-induced toxicity usually occurs after exposure of lung tissue via the circulation to parent drug or metabolites, although increasingly the adverse effects of direct administration of drugs to the lungs needs consideration in preclinical studies.",

Drugs mediate allergic reactions in the bronchi or lungs. They may also produce a variety of obscure, diffuse pulmonary alveolar conditions including a pulmonary syndrome resembling systemic lupus er3^hematosis. As the respiratory tract is a major route by which microorganisms gain entry into the body, opportunistic pulmonary infections with bacteria, viruses, fungi or protozoa are consequences of immunosuppression or broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. As in other organs, drugs that disturb coagulation may precipitate pulmonary thromboembolism or haemorrhage. Localized lung lesions also result from accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic inhalation of xenobiotics. Mucociliary clearance is also sensitive to therapeutic agents that affect the secretion of mucus and fluid, ciliary activity and transport.^ Treatment with antacids or histamine H2 blockers can also increase the risk of pneumonia developing in patients in intensive care units through increasing gastric pH, which leads to an overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria in the stomach and retrograde pharyngeal colonization.^ In preclinical safety studies, pathology of the respiratory system can be the result of intercurrent disease or be induced by drugs administered systemically. Intranasal or inhalation modes of therapy pose particular challenges in terms of the formulations and the technologies required to administer drug. The different anatomical and physiological characteristics of the airways also influence drug toxicity, disposition and metabolism. The development of drugs to be administered by inhalation or intranasal routes is particularly difficult because of the perceived risks of high local drug concentration in respiratory tissues and their use in potentially vulnerable patients with pulmonary disease.^",

Site of deposition depends primarily on particle size, but variability in the sites of deposition occurs among different laboratory animal species and humans by virtue of the differences in the size and shape of the respiratory passages as well as breathing patterns. ^^ In addition, there are different types of inhalers used in human therapy to consider in the assessment, which can deliver different materials to the lungs, for example nebulizers, propellant-driven metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers for asthma treatment. ^^ The subsequent fate of inhaled particles depends not only on their size but also their shape, chemical nature, and solubility in body fluids. Soluble substances are absorbed into the blood stream and are removed by the pulmonary circulation. They may also undergo metabolism by enzymes present in the cell populations of the respiratory tract and reactive metabolites may cause local pulmonary damage. Insoluble, inert particles are removed primarily by the mucociliary transport system of the trachea and bronchi or through phagocytosis by macrophages. Overload of the lung by even relatively inert, nonfibrous particles such as titanium dioxide or carbon black may impair alveolar macrophage-mediated particle clearance. ^^ This may lead in turn to accumulation of dusts over time with eventual fibrotic and tumorigenic responses, particularly in rats.^^ Measurements of respiration rate, tidal volume, airway resistance, pulmonary gas exchange and the disposition of the inhaled substances have an important place in the evaluation of chemically induced lung damage in laboratory animals.^\"^'^^ However, the key component of the evaluation of the adverse effects of inhaled substances is careful morphological assessment of the fixed tissues.

Maxilloturbinates are relatively simple structures in man and non-human primates but highly complex in dogs and rodents. As a consequence, regional nasal airflow and disposition patterns vary considerably and this influences the distribution of lesions produced by inhaled xenobiotics in the nasal cavity.^^ However, comparison of the nasal cavity of rhesus monkey and humans using magnetic resonance imaging and nasal casts have shown that many similarities in structure exist in these species. ^^ The anterior nares are lined by stratified squamous epithelium. In other zones the sinuses are covered either by respiratory or olfactory epithelium with a zone of transitional epithelium at the junction between the two types. Respiratory epithelium is similar to that found elsewhere in the respiratory passages being composed of ciliated cells, serous and mucous cells, brush cells, intermediate cells and progenitor basal cells. It represents a cellular system engaged in mucociliary clearance carrying surface secretions to the nasopharynx to be cleared by swallowing. Although this epithelium is similar to that lining the other large airways, key differences are the particularly rich complement of secretory cells and the complex vasculature of the nose which can modulate capillary, arterial and venous blood flow through the mucosa.^^ Mucins may be particularly important. It has been postulated that they not only have a physical protective function but also possess antioxidant properties by virtue of the scavenging behaviour of their high proportion of sugar groups. ^^ The proportion of the nose lined by olfactory mucosa is variable between species, being disposed over a much larger area in dogs and rodents than in primates. ^^ However, it is structurally similar in humans and rodents. It is located in more dorsal or posterior regions of the nasal passages out of the direct line of airflow during normal respiration. Olfactory mucosa is a pseudostratified columnar epithelium composed of basal cells, sustentacular cells and sensory cells with mucus-secreting Bowman's glands situated in the lamina propria. Basal cells are composed of two distinct types, light and dark cells. The light type represents the primitive, stem cell population. Sustentacular or supporting cells are non-ciliated, columnar cells possessing microvilli that extend into the overlying layer of mucus.",

It has been shown that the distribution of immune-reactive enzymes is different in olfactory and respiratory mucosa.^^ Xenobiotics can be metabolized within both olfactory and respiratory mucosa but the olfactory regions appear to possess greatest capability for oxidative metabolism. Consequently, regional differences in nasal toxicity and tumour formation from inhaled materials may not only be a response to different water solubility and deposition patterns but also differences in the formation of reactive metabolites.^'* Another feature of this metabolizing activity is that it can be induced by systemically administered xenobiotics and this can alter the distribution of enzyme activity in the nasal mucosa.^^ Studies of the mouse olfactory mucosa have shown that whilst typical hepatic inducers of CYP2A5 do not significantly change its expression in the mucosa, olfactory toxicants can alter the pattern of enzyme distribution.^^'^^ Like many other tissues exposed to external environmental agents, the nasal mucosa possesses aggregates of lymphoid tissue in the underlying lamina propria.

Although the degree of histological changes varied with different agents, the changes were broadly similar in type and distribution.^^ Most agents examined produced little or no alteration in the squamous mucosa lining the anterior part of the nose apart from some mild increase in thickness of the squamous layers. Principal sites of damage were shown to be the anterior respiratory epithelium adjacent to the vestibule and the olfactory epithelium of the dorsal meatus. There was a distinct decrease in severity in posterior regions. Histologically, the lesions in respiratory epithelium ranged from mild loss of cilia and small areas of epithelial exfoliation to frank erosion, ulceration and necrosis of the epithelium and underlying tissues including bone. Variable polymorphonuclear cell infiltration was also found. In some cases, early squamous metaplasia developed on the free margins or the naso-maxillo-turbinates.

In severe cases, complete loss of olfactory epithelium occurred. Although the degree of histological change was shown to vary with different agents, lesions induced by the more water-soluble chemicals tended to remain localized in the anterior part of the nasal cavity whereas agents with relatively low water solubility produced lung lesions in addition.

For instance, following inoculation with Mycoplasma pulmonis, one of the more important respiratory pathogens among laboratory rodents both Lewis and Fischer 344 rats were shown to develop upper and lower respiratory tract inflammation. In the Lewis strain this was characterized after 28 days by a variable acute inflammatory exudate in bronchi and bronchioles with focal bronchiectasis, inflammation and hyperplasia of the epithelium with a predominantly macrophage infiltration of the alveoli and alveolar walls.^^'^^^ These changes were associated with marked hyperplasia of the bronchusassociated lymphoid tissue (BALT), which extended down the airways and blood vessels towards the periphery of the lungs. Although the lymphoid hyperplasia was also found in inoculated Fischer 344 rats, it was less marked and accompanied by little or no mucopurulent exudate or active inflammation of the bronchial walls. This disparity in response suggested that differences were related to the degree of lymphocyte activation in the two strains, an imbalance in regulation of lymphocyte proliferation in Lewis rats, or both.^^^ Other studies have been conducted in both rats and mice infected with another important respiratory pathogen of laboratory rodents, the Sendai virus (parainfluenza type 1). Sequential studies showed that the initial damage to bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium is associated with polymorphonuclear and lymphocytic inflammation (bronchiolitis). Immunocytochemical and ultrastructural studies revealed the presence of viral antigen in the mucosa.^^^ Hyperplastic and multinucleated syncytial epithelial cells develop in the hyperplastic terminal bronchiolar epithelium and the inflammatory process extended to involve peribronchial or peribronchiolar parenchyma with infiltration of alveolar walls by mononuclear cells, macrophages and neutrophils. A similar cell population accompanied by cell debris and oedema fluid develops in air spaces. Pulmonary arteries show only minor involvement with inflammatory cells and focal reactive hyperplasia of the endothelium. Immunocytochemistry and ultrastructural examination suggested that virus replication takes place in alveolar type I and type II epithelial cells and macrophages but not in endothelial or interstitial cells of the alveolar septae.^^^ It was shown that when repair occurs there may be residual distortion of bronchiolar and alveolar walls by collagen and hyperplastic cuboidal epithelium may line the thickened alveolar septa. Air spaces may also contain enlarged macrophages with pale vacuolated cytoplasm.^^^ Strain differences in susceptibility have also been demonstrated to this virus. There is differential pulmonary interleukin 12 (IL-12) gene expression between virus-susceptible Brown Norway rats and resistant Fischer 344 rats and IL-12 treatment provides protection from virus-induced chronic airway inflammation and remodelling. Moreover increased tumour necrosis factor a (TNFa) expression has been shown to be an important regulatory factor in the development of Sendai virus-induced bronchiolar flbrosis in infected rats.^^^ Virus-inoculated Brown Norway rats had increased TNFa pulmonary mRNA levels and increased numbers of bronchiolar macrophages and fibroblasts expressing TNFa protein compared with virus-inoculated F344 rats.^^^ The Corona virus, which causes sialodacryoadenitis in many rat colonies, also produces lower respiratory tract inflammation. This is characterized by acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis with focal extension into lung parenchyma. Thickened oedematous, hypercellular alveolar walls infiltrated by monocytic cells are found.^^ Immunocytochemistry has shown the presence of viral antigen in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells.

Studies from humans have shown that three chnically distinct forms of this condition occur: congenital, secondary or acquired. The congenital disease is caused by a diverse range of mutations in the genes encoding surfactant proteins or the (3c chain of the receptor of granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The secondary form occurs in association with conditions where there is functional impairment or reduced numbers of alveolar macrophages, such as in haematological cancers, following immune suppression or inhalation of silica or toxic fumes. Acquired or idiopathic alveolar proteinosis that accounts for over 90% of all cases (0.37 per 100000 persons) has been an enigma until recently. Patients are at risk from infections, particularly nocardia, and the 5 year survival rate appears to be about 75%. Studies from transgenic mouse models and in humans have shown that autoantibodies against GM-CSF are important in the development of the acquired form of the disease as this antibody causes a defect in macrophages function which impairs the catabolism of surfactant lipids and proteins. ^^^ In this context it is of interest to note that treatment with imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase constitutively expressed in Philadelphia chromosome positive myeloid leukemia, has been associated with the accumulation of lamellar inclusions in pulmonary macrophages in a leukaemia patient, although this might have been a result of the primary disease. ^^^ Studies in mice have suggested that imatinib mesylate actually inhibits the fibrogenic activity of transforming growth factor (3 and prevents fibrosis induced by bleomycin.^^^",

They usually compress surrounding tissues without infiltration or metastatic spread (adenoma), although loss of differentiation, infiltration and spread to adjacent tissues can occur (adenocarcinoma). Ultrastructural study of bronchiolar-alveolar neoplasia in Fischer 344 rats has shown the presence of osmiophilic, lamellated inclusion bodies similar to those found in alveolar type II cells. Therefore it has been suggested that the neoplasms are derived from this cell type.^^^ Pulmonary squamous carcinoma occurs but is a very uncommon spontaneous neoplasm in the rat.^^ The large proliferative but benign cystic lesions found in the lungs of rats following accumulation of large amounts of particulate matter have been termed pulmonary cystic keratinizing epitheliomas for they have been regarded as benign neoplasms. When these lesions show evidence of tissue invasion they are regarded as pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas. Similar lesions are very occasionally reported as spontaneous lesions.^^^",

Even in the same laboratory, mice housed under similar conditions show variation in incidence in these neoplasms with time. The incidence of lung adenomas and adenocarcinomas occurring in CD-I mice used as controls in 18-month carcinogenicity bioassays in the same laboratory under similar conditions for a period of 3 years varied from between 19 and 36% in males and 6 to 16% in females.^^^ By contrast, some strains of mice such as the C5781/10J strain show a very low predisposition to the development of lung adenomas.^^^ Although these mouse pulmonary adenomas and adenocarcinomas do not resemble the common lung tumours in humans, strain differences have been exploited to study genetic susceptibility and resistance to pulmonary adenomas and carcinomas.^^^'^^^ Histologically, pulmonary tumours of this type in mice are generally small, sharply circumscribed nodules composed of fairly uniform, closely packed columns of cuboidal or columnar cells arranged in tubular or papillary structures with scanty fibrovascular stroma ( Figure 6 .5). They may be less well differentiated, with cellular pleomorphism, and show intrabronchial growth, invade lung parenchyma and produce metastatic spread.",

On the basis of sequential light and electron microscopic study of pulmonary adenomas induced in Bagg-Webster Swiss mice by transplacental exposure to ethylnitrosourea, it has been suggested that they develop from either alveolar type II cells or Clara cells.^^^'^^^ Careful, stepwise analysis using light microscopic and electron microscopic examination has suggested that adenomas can be divided into three principal groups. Some are composed of solid growths of uniform cuboidal cells with expanding margins limited to alveolar septae (alveolar pattern). These cells contained concentrically arranged cytoplasmic lamellar bodies and abundant, large mitochondria similar to mitochondria found in alveolar type II cells. Tubular or papillary patterns are composed of cuboidal cells showing histological and ultrastructural features of Clara cell differentiation.^^^ However, immunocytochemical studies of chemically induced and spontaneous pulmonary neoplasia in B6C3F1, BALB/c or A strain mice have shown that the majority of adenocarcinomas, including those showing papillary patterns, contain surfactant apoprotein, typical of type II antigens, suggesting that most neoplasms show alveolar type II differentiation.^^^ However, in view of the plasticity of Clara cells, this does not exclude a Clara cell origin of the tumours. Immunocytochemistry of specific Clara cell secretory protein expression in a transgenic mouse model of lung carcinomas developing from Clara cells has shown that the protein is lost during tumour cell progression.^^^ It has also been shown in strain A mice that the proportion of tumours with papillary and solid/alveolar growth patterns varies with the inducing agent.^^^ This also suggests biological differences exist between histological subtypes.",

There is considerable risk in over-interpretation of such group differences in conventional mouse bioassays. In the analysis of group differences, consideration needs to be given to tissue sampling procedure, age-standardization, historical control incidence, effects on food intake as well as the results of mutagenicity studies and carcinogenicity bioassays in other rodent species. Indeed, a considerable number of widely employed therapeutic agents of different classes have produced an increase in benign or malignant pulmonary tumours in carcinogenicity studies performed in mice without this proving of any significance to humans. Davies and Monro counted at least 17 drugs of this type in the 1994 Physicians' Desk Reference of the United States.^^^ For instance, in a carcinogenicity bioassay in which CFl mice were treated for 80 weeks with the synthetic analgesic tilidine fumarate, a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) was reported in the incidence of lung adenocarcinomas between the top dose female group (24%) and concurrent controls (10%).^^^ It was argued that group differences did not indicate tumorigenic potential of tilidine fumarate on the basis that the incidence in the high dose group was within the historical control range (27%) and that there was no tumorigenic effect in a parallel 104 week rat carcinogenicity study.",
