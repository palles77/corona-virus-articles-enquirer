Canine and feline parvoviruses cause an acute enteric disease in their hosts, with high level of viral shedding. In this study, a quantitative TaqMan PCR for detection and quantitation of canine and feline parvoviruses in serum and fecal samples was developed. The primers were designed based upon the entire GenBank content for CPV and FPLV. A standard curve was generated, and validation tests were performed using 10-fold serial dilutions of CPV-2 virus in CPV/FPLV-negative feces and CPV/FPLV-negative serum samples. As a result, the 100% detection limit of the PCR was 18 copies of the viral genome per l of serum and fecal sample. All canine parvovirus types as well as FPLV were detected. In conclusion, the real-time PCR represents an upgraded and useful tool to identify and quantify canine and feline parvoviruses in different sample matrices.",

            "text": "Clinical diagnosis of CPV-2 infection can be inconclusive, since several other pathogens may cause diarrhea in dogs. For this reason, a clinical diagnosis should always be confirmed by laboratory tests. For FPLV, which can cause anorexia, weight loss, vomiting and diarrhea, even the finding of severe leucopenia with compatible clinical signs is presumptive without laboratorial confirmation tests. Several methods have been developed for the laboratory diagnosis of CPV-2 or FPLV infection. Usually, feces from diarrheic cats and dogs are screened using ELISA or hemagglutination (HA) tests, but these techniques are affected by relatively low sensitivity (Mochizuki et al., 1993; Uwatoko et al., 1995) . Additionally, the HA method depends upon the antigenic structures in the virus capsid. Virus mutants with amino acid changes in regions determining the antigenicity may exhibit altered hemagglutination capacity (Strassheim et al., 1993) . Virus isolation in cell lines can also be * Corresponding author. used; however the technique requires a time period of at least 3-4 days, and, some strains do not produce clear cytopathic effects in the cell culture (Decaro et al., 2005) . Molecular methods to detect CPV-2 and FPLV have been described, mostly based upon the polymerase chain reaction for the detection of the parvovirus in feces of dogs and cats (Buonavoglia et al., 2001; Hirasawa et al., 1996; Schunck et al., 1995) . In the last ten years, several methods to detect CPV-2 were reported applying the real-time PCR technology. The comparison of the conventional PCR with the real-time PCR demonstrated a greater sensitivity for the latter one (Decaro et al., 2005; Kumar and Nandi, 2010) , progressively replacing the virus isolation and HA as the standard procedure for virus surveillance and virus diagnosis. However, a technique able to detect the virus in feces of clinical compromised animals and to quantify the virus in body fluids from sick and healthy animals was not described. Additionally, with the increased number of novel strains (containing new nucleotide substitution), an upgrade in the used primers becomes important. Based upon this, the aim of the present study was to develop a qPCR method applying the TaqMan technology for the detection and quantitation of CPV-2 and FPLV in serum and fecal samples.",

In the feces, the limit of detection was 20% detecting 1.8 copies/l and 100% detecting 1.8 \u00d7 10 1 copies/l. Comparing the methods usually applied for diagnostic purpose with the real-time PCR, we found that the IF technique could detect only 12% of the samples (submitted for diagnostic purpose) as positive. In contrast to that, 32% of the samples were tested positive using the conventional PCR, whereas the real-time could detect 58% of the samples as positive (Table 1) .",

Such methods may demand tissue culture to isolate the virus or serological methods to determine the identity of the isolate, are known to be highly time and labor consumptive. In contrast, the real-time PCR method facilitates a large increase in the throughput, enables simultaneous processing of several samples and provides the possibility of computer based data analysis of the results.",

This is in accordance with other quantitative methods for the detection of CPV-2 based upon the real-time PCR (Decaro et al., 2005; Kumar and Nandi, 2010) , highlighting the excellent suitability of the real-time PCR method for canine and feline parvovirosis diagnosis. When the method was used for samples collected for clinical purposes, a higher sensitivity compared to the IF technique and conventional PCR could clearly be observed. This sensitivity may permit insights in the time course of viral loads in serum samples, even in the complete absence of clinical symptoms. This can represent an advantage for vaccine development tests or vaccine efficacy tests, when even low amounts of DNA are important to be measured. As additional advantage, this method was designed to detect both canine and feline parvoviruses. Therefore in cats, that may be infected by both viruses, only one diagnostic test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Notably, it has been observed that canine and feline parvoviruses displays high evolutionary rates (Shackelton et al., 2005) , and for this reason, nucleotide substitutions are a frequent finding. In the present study, the high number of sequences used to select the primers provides an upgraded method for the detection of those viruses and reduces the probability of false-negative detection due to new viral mutations.",
