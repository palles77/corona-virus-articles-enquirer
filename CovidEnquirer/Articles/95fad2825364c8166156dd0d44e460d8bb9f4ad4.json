            "text": "Norovirus (NoV) is an approximately 7.5-Kbp single positive-strand RNA virus that has been classified into the Caliciviridae, genus Norovirus (Clarke et al., 2011). There are 3 open reading frames (ORFs) in the NoV genome. ORF1 encodes NTPase (helicase), Vpg and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein, VP1, and ORF3 encodes the minor capsid protein, VP2. (Clarke et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2006) . NoV has been classified into 6 genogroups, GI-GVI (Clarke et al., 2011; White, 2014) , based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the full-length VP1 region. NoV genogroups are further classified into subgenogroups. For example, in GIV NoV, GIV HNoV is classified into subgenogroup 1 (GIV.1) while GIV FNoV and GIV CNoV are classified into subgenogroup 2 (GIV.2). GI, GII, and GIV (GIV.1) have been identified in humans, GII in pigs, GIII in ruminants including cattle, GIV (GIV.2) in cats and lions, GV in mice, and GIV(GVI.2) and GVI(GVI.1 and GVI.2) in dogs (Clarke et al., 2011) . The first NoV in carnivores was detected in captive lion cubs with severe enteritis (Martella et al., 2007) .",

Based on the results of the Simplot analysis, the FNoV M49-1 strain (GVI.1) may have been produced by recombination between GIV.2 FNoV and GVI.1 CNoV. It currently remains unclear which of these 3 viruses has the same origin. The number of GIV NoV and GVI NoV samples needs to be increased and a gene analysis performed in order to investigate their origins. The high homology of a part of VP1 between GVI.1 CNoV and oysterderived NoV was previously reported (Martella et al., 2009). Cat No. 49 , which carried the FNoV M49-1 strain, was captured in a region along the sea in which oyster farming is thriving. Thus, we cannot rule out that the FNoV M49-1 strain was derived from oysters, and needs to be investigated in future studies.",

            "text": "Viremia has been noted with shedding of the virus in the feces of HNoV-infected children (Frange et al., 2012; Takanashi et al., 2009) . Viremia was also observed early after infection in gnotobiotic animals inoculated with NoV (Souza et al., 2008) . However, viremia was not detected in NoV-inoculated chimpanzees even though the virus was shed in their feces (Bok et al., 2011) . Transient viremia was noted in all cats with primary infection with the FNoV M49-1 strain, and cats clearly showing clinical symptoms were more likely to intermittently develop viremia; however, we could not identify the significance of viremia in FNoV M49-1 strain infection. The relationship between viremia and clinical symptoms has not yet been elucidated.",

When the amino acid sequence of the region from the C-terminal of RdRp to the N-terminal of VP2 was analyzed, the FNoV M49-1 strain was genotyped GVI, which was different from the conventional stain of FNoV. FNoV was detected with the development of clinical symptoms in SPF cats orally inoculated with fecal samples containing the FNoV M49-1 strain. These results may be useful for studies on FNoV and other GIV and GVI NoV.",
