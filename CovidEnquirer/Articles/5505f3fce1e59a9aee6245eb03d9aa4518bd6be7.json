            "text": "Long non-coding RNAs in the regulation of the immune response James A. Heward and Mark A. Lindsay Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, UK It is increasingly clear that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate a variety biological responses, and that they do so by a diverse range of mechanisms. In the field of immunology, recent publications have shown widespread changes in the expression of lncRNAs during the activation of the innate immune response and T cell development, differentiation, and activation. These lncRNAs control important aspects of immunity such as production of inflammatory mediators, differentiation, and cell migration through regulating protein-protein interactions or via their ability to basepair with RNA and DNA. We review the current understanding of the mechanism of action of these immune-related lncRNAs, discuss their impact on physiological and pathological processes, and highlight important areas of inquiry at the intersection between immunology and lncRNA biology.",

            "text": "What are lncRNAs? The first draft of the human genome uncovered several surprises including the observation that exonic regions of protein-coding genes represented <2% of the genome. Although some of the remaining DNA plays a crucial role in the maintenance of DNA structure and regulation of mRNA expression (i.e., transcription binding sites, promoter and enhancer regions), subsequent studies have shown that a significant proportion is transcribed into 'non-coding RNAs' (ncRNAs). Indeed, the recent release of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (the 'ENCODE' project aims to catalogue all the functional elements in human DNA) has concluded that 80% of DNA is functional and, importantly, that the majority (62%) is transcribed into non-coding RNA (ncRNA) [1, 2] . However, the broad definition employed to identify functional/transcribed regions of DNA, which included an association with modified histones, methylated CpG dinucleotides or open chromatin, means this is likely to be an overestimate [3, 4] . Indeed, examination of evolutionary conservation gives a more conservative estimate of 10% functional DNA, although this still allows for large regions that might be transcribed into ncRNA [3, 4] .",

The microRNA (miRNA) family of short ncRNAs are best characterised and are known to induce mRNA degradation or block mRNA translation via the RNA interference pathway. By contrast, much less in known about lncRNAs although, in comparison with mRNAs, these are generally shorter in length, contain fewer albeit longer exons, and are expressed at lower levels (median is 10% of mRNAs) [1, 5, 6] . lncRNAs also demonstrate low evolutionary sequence conservation, with estimates that only 15% of mouse protein-coding genes have homologues in humans, leading to speculation that the majority of lncRNAs are non-functional [6] [7] [8] [9] . The most recent release from Gen-Code (version 19) has annotated 14 000 lncRNA genes in humans [5] although, given that many lncRNAs are expressed in a cell-, tissue-, and developmental stagespecific manner, this is likely to be a significant underestimate [1, 10] . Presently, lncRNAs are classified by their position relative to protein-coding mRNAs and comprise the long intergenic ncRNA (lincRNA), intronic lncRNA, antisense lncRNA, transcribed pseudogene lncRNAs, and enhancer RNA (eRNA) (Box 1). However, these arbitrary definitions will need refining in the light of the increasing volume of sequencing data and the accumulating information on lncRNA function and mechanism.",

As described in the forthcoming sections, immune-related lncRNAs are generally identified through examination of differential expression in response to activation of immune cells. This provides the basis for the subsequent functional and mechanistic analysis of individual lncRNAs. For clarity, these individual lncRNAs will be reviewed under the headings of innate immunity, acquired immunity, hostpathogen interaction, and enhancer RNAs.

            "text": "Mechanism of action of immune-related lncRNAs An interesting observation from the sequencing data is that many of the immune-related lncRNAs are located close to, or partially overlapping, the 5 0 end (upstream) or 3 0 end (downstream) of protein-coding genes implicated (and differentially expressed) in the immune response [13, 14] . These are commonly transcribed in the antisense direction (relative to the protein-coding gene) which, in the case of upstream lncRNAs, can produce bidirectional transcription of the lncRNA and mRNA from a shared promoter region. Confusingly, these are often termed antisense lncRNAs despite there being only partial or no overlap with protein-coding genes and, as a result, we have recently proposed that these should instead be classified as mRNA-flanking lncRNAs (mf-lncRNAs) [13] . Given their locations, this group of lncRNAs which include THRIL (TNFa and hnRNPL related immunoregulatory lincRNA) [15] , PACER (p50-associated COX-2 extragenic RNA) [16] , lincR-Ccr2-5 0 AS [14] , lnc-IL7R [17] , and IL1b-RBT46 [13] , have been shown to regulate the expression of their adjacent protein-coding gene in cis. eRNAs have also been demonstrated to control expression of protein-coding genes in cis, although chromatin looping is thought to be responsible for bringing the distal enhancer regions into close proximity with the promoter regions. The majority of the remaining immune-related lncRNAs, which are located in intergenic regions, regulate the immune response in trans. In addition to their cis actions, the four mRNA-flanking lncRNAs THRIL [15] , lincR-Ccr2-5 0 AS [14] , lnc-IL7R [17] , and IL1b-RBT46 [13] have also been shown regulate the expression of multiple additional genes in trans.",

[32] who used the intergenic deposition of epigenetic marks to identify 20 lincRNAs induced in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDD). Microarray and RNA sequencing Box 1. Classification of lncRNAs With limited information on their function and mechanism of action, lncRNAs are currently classified by their positions relative to proteincoding genes ( Figure I ). In general, most lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and are therefore capped, polyadenylated and commonly spliced. Antisense lncRNAs are transcribed across the exons of protein-coding genes from the opposite strand [76] whereas intronic lncRNAs are transcribed from intronic regions in either the sense or antisense orientation. The largest group are the intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), that are located between protein-coding genes [32, 77] . Two additional groups that could arguably be classified as lincRNAs are transcribed pseudogenes and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Transcribed pseudogenes arise when a gene loses the ability to produce a protein, either through mutation or inaccurate duplication [78] . eRNAs are produced by either mono-and bidirectional transcription at intergenic enhancer regions and can be differentiated from other lincRNAs by the presence of high H3K4me1 marks in their promoter regions [61, 79, 80] . This contrasts with the members of the antisense, intronic, intergenic, and pseudogene lncRNA families that are associated with epigenetic marks characteristic of protein-coding genes (i.e., high H3Kme3 in the promoter region). Lnc-IL7R LPS-stimulated monocytic THP1 cells Lnc-IL7R is transcribed from the 3 0 -UTR of IL7R in the sense orientation.

[32] and located 50 kb downstream from the Cox2 (Ptgs2) gene, lincRNA-Cox2 was demonstrated to repress expression of 787 genes in nonstimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and induce an increase in 713 genes following exposure to palmitoyl-3-cysteinyl-seryl-(lysyl) 4 (Pam3CSK 4 ; a TLR1/2 agonist) [28] ( Figure 1A ). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed these groups were enriched for genes involved in the immune response and included Ccl5 and Il6. Although the precise mechanism is unknown, the repressive action of lincRNA-Cox2 was mediated through interaction with hnRNP-A/B and hnRNP-A2/B1 [28] . These hnRNPs are members of a family of multifunctional RNA-binding proteins that are known to have a role in the processing of precursor mRNA, as well as in regulating gene expression [36] . Of relevance, Sauvageau et al. [37] have recently reported the production of a lincRNA-Cox2 knockout mouse which will provide an invaluable resource for the in vivo studies. Limited preliminary analyses have shown that lincRNA-Cox2 is selectively expressed in the lung, and that knockout does not impact upon the development of these animals [37] . Gas5",

NeST induced the expression of IFN-g through an interaction with WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5), a core subunit of the MLL histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complex [30] LincR-Ccr2-5 0 AS Mouse CD4 + T H 2 cells RNA-seq studies identified 1524 lincRNAs in 42 mouse T cell subsets. LincR-Ccr2-5 0 AS was located at the 5 0end of Ccr2 in CD4 + T H 2 cells and was shown to regulate both the induction and suppression of gene expression during T H 2 differentiation. LincR-Ccr2-5 0 AS is also implicated in chemokine-mediated signalling including cell migration [14] Multiple Mouse T and B cells LncRNAs shown to regulate chromatin remodelling associated with variable, diversity, and joining (V(D)J) recombination required to produce antigen receptors (Ig or TCR) [48] Multiple Mouse B cells Transcription of antisense and sense lncRNAs is associated with looping of V H regions into close proximity with the DJ H region during recombination in pro-B cells, a process that occurs within transcription factories [49] Pathogen-associated PAN KSHV-infected B cell lines PAN (polyadenylated nuclear) RNA expression from KSHV was shown to modulate host cell response including downregulation of IFNg, IL18, and ainterferon 16 [52] PAN KSHV-infected B-and T cell lines PAN RNA-mediated suppression of host genes is mediated through polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated histone methylation [29] Review [28] . (B) Using human THP1 macrophages, THRIL was identified as an antisense lncRNA (overlapping BRI3BP) that promotes TNF transcription by forming a complex with hnRNPL and binding to the promoter of TNF [15] . THRIL is expressed basally; however, this is decreased in a negative feedback loop following Pam3Csk4-induced TNFa release [15] . THRIL has also been shown to regulate basal and Pam3Csk4-stimulated gene expression. (C) Lethe expression is induced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts following treatment with TNFa, IL1b, and dexamethasone, and prevents NF-kB binding to NF-kB response elements [25] . (D) In basal cells, SFPQ1 is bound to the CXCL8 promoter to repress its transcription, as well as to NEAT1 lincRNA within the paraspeckle bodies. NEAT1 expression is upregulated upon viral infection, leading to an increase in the size of THRIL regulates TNFa release and global gene expression in human monocytic THP-1 cells THRIL is located downstream of the gene encoding the BRI3 binding protein (Bri3 bp), is transcribed from the opposite strand, and partially overlaps the 3 0 -end of Bri3 bp. Expression of THRIL in human monocytic THP-1 cells is reduced in response to Pam3CSK 4 , although this effect was indirect and mediated through autocrine/paracrine TNFa release. THRIL knockdown reduced expression of 444 genes (only 10 genes were increased) in nonstimulated cells and blocked differential expression of 317 of the 618 genes seen in response to Pam3CSK4, including multiple inflammatory genes such as IL6, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL1, and CSF1 [15] . As with lincRNA-Cox2, THRIL was shown to interact with hnRNPL, with the resultant complex binding to the TNFa promoter and driving transcription in both control and Pam3CSK4-stimulated THP1 macrophages ( Figure 1B) .",

Under basal conditions, paraspeckles contain several proteins including SFPQ, which are bound to NEAT1. However, in addition to NEAT1, SFPQ is also known to repress the transcription of CXCL8 through binding within its promoter region. Following reports that NEAT1 expression is increased after viral infection of mouse neural cells [40] , Imamura et al. [23] examined the role of NEAT1 in the antiviral response within HeLa and A549 epithelial cells. Activation of TLR3 using poly(IC), or infection with influenza virus or herpes simplex virus, was shown to stimulate NEAT1 expression, resulting in NEAT1-dependent increases in paraspeckle formation [23] . Significantly, increased CXCL8 expression also occurred as a result of the translocation of SFPQ from the CXCL8 promoter sites to the paraspeckles ( Figure 1D ). Of relevance, knockdown and overexpression identified 85 additional genes that were regulated by NEAT1, including several that are involved in the antiviral response [23] .",

Increased PACER expression, following PMA-induced differentiation of the monocytic U937 cell into macrophages and subsequent LPS-stimulation, was required for PMA/LPS-induced COX2 expression. This action was mediated through an interaction between PACER and the inhibitory p50 homodimer (of NF-kB). PACER decreased p50-p50 occupancy at the Cox2 promoter and permitted the binding of the active p50-p65 form of NF-kB and assembly of the RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex [16] ( Figure 1F ). This event was associated with the recruitment of p300 histone acetyltransferase and increases in histone acetylation. Of relevance, these researchers demonstrate that baseline PACER expression and access to the Cox2 promoter were established and maintained by the chromatin boundary/insulator factor CTCF, which opened the chromatin structure in this region [16] . In summary, these reports have described widespread changes in lncRNA expression following activation of the innate immune response and have shown that these can regulate gene expression, the production of inflammatory mediators, and the differentiation of monocytes into macrophage and dendritic cells. In addition to the innate immune response, publications have also begun to reveal a role for lncRNAs in T cell biology and the adaptive immune response.",

Using microarrays, these investigators uncovered 100s of lymphoid-specific lncRNAs that showed altered expression during CD8 + T cell activation and following differentiation into CD8 + memory and effector T cells [44] . More recently, a comprehensive analysis of lincRNA expression during development and differentiation of 42 mouse T cell subsets identified 1524 lincRNA genes [14] . Focusing on the polarization of CD4 + T cells into T H 1 and T H 2 subsets, they showed that the expression of T H 1-specific lincRNAs was preferentially induced by the T H 1-related transcription factors, STAT4 and T-box transcription factor (T-bet). Similarly, the T H 2-specific transcription factor STAT6 and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) preferentially regulated T H 2 lincRNA expression. Once again, there is now merging evidence linking individual lncRNAs with T cell function.",

Mechanistic studies showed that interaction between NRON and karyopherin importin-b1 (KPNB1) blocked the nucleocytoplasmic transport and therefore the transcriptional activity of NFAT [24] (Figure 2A ). Subsequent studies in resting cells indicated that the heavily phosphorylated NFAT is located within a large cytoplasmic RNA-protein complex that contains NRON, a scaffold protein [IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein (IQGAP)], and three NFAT kinases [casein kinase 1 (CK), glycogen synthase 3 (GSK), and dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase (DYRK)] [45] . Knockdown studies showed a functional synergy between NRON and IQGAP1 in blocking NFAT de-phosphorylation, a process that is required for nuclear translocation/activation and induction of IL-2 [45] (Figure 2A) . NRON is therefore a constitutively expressed, intronic lncRNA that forms a complex with other proteins to bind the inactive NFAT and localise this transcription factor in the cytoplasm.",

NeST, which was formally known as Tmevpg1, is expressed in T H 1 CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, and natural killer cells [46] . Earlier work showed that expression of NeST was increased in T H 1 but not T H 2 polarised cells, correlated with Ifng expression, and was dependent upon the T H 1-specific transcription factors STAT4 and T-bet [47] . By using mouse strains overexpressing NeST, Gomez et al. [30] showed increased clearance of Salmonella infection but reduced resistance to Theiler's virus, a mouse picornavirus. Mechanistic analysis indicated that nucleus-located NeST induced the expression of Ifng in trans in activated CD8 + T cells through an interaction with WDR5, a core subunit of the MLL H3K4 methyltransferase complex, leading to histone methylation at the Ifng locus [30] ( Figure 2B ). Overall, this milestone publication is the first to have shown that lncRNAs play a central role in regulating the adaptive immune response using an in vivo infection model. lincR-Ccr2-5 0 AS regulates mouse T H 2 migration into the lung The T H 2-specific lincR-Ccr2-5 0 AS, which is located at the 5 0 end of Ccr2 and transcribed in the antisense direction, was identified during lincRNA expression profiling of 42 T cell subsets in mice [14] . shRNA-mediated lincR-Ccr2-5 0 AS knockdown (delivered via lentivirus) in mouse T H 2 cells resulted in the upregulation of 709 mRNAs that were shown to be preferentially expressed in T H 2 cells and enriched for genes involved in the immune response. There was also downregulation of 656 genes associated with the cell cycle and nuclear division [14] . Its mechanism of action is currently unknown, although knockdown had no effect upon H3K4me3 levels, DNase hypersensitivity, and RNA polymerase II binding, thus indicating that lincR-Ccr2-5 0 AS does not function by modifying epigenetic marks and chromatin accessibility ( Figure 2C ). Given that lincR-Ccr2-5 0 AS expression was highly correlated with seven of the 23 genes implicated in chemokine-mediated signaling pathways, including six that were located in the same genomic region, these investigators proceeded to examine its role in cell migration. Interestingly, they found that lincR-Ccr2-5 0 AS knockdown in T H 2 cells impaired migration of T H 2 cells to the lung.",

By comparison, little is known about B cell function, although Bolland et al. [48] have described a role for lncRNAs in the chromatin remodelling associated with the variable, diversity, and joining (V(D)J) recombination required to produce antigen receptors (Ig or TCR). A subsequent publication has shown that transcription of these antisense and sense lncRNAs is linked to looping of V H regions into close proximity with the DJ H region during recombination in pro-B cells [49] .

An example of the former is NEAT1, which controls HIV-1 replication by regulating the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic export of Rev-dependent instability element (INS) containing HIV mRNA [50] . Another well-characterised example Review Trends in Immunology September 2014, Vol. 35, No. 9 is polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA produced by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) that is able to modulate viral gene expression as well as subvert the host immune response. Thus, induction of PAN RNA is important in the switch from latent to lytic infection [51, 52] , a process mediated by an interaction between PAN and the demethylases UTX and JMJD3 to remove the suppressive H3K23me3 mark within the KSHV viral genome ( Figure 3A ) [31] . Of note, PAN also physically interacts with LANA (latency associated nuclear antigen), a protein that maintains latency by binding to the KSHV genome, and has a role in regulating the dissociation of the LANA protein upon viral activation [53] . In addition to regulating the viral life cycle, PAN RNA also suppressed the expression of host genes involved in the inflammatory and antiviral response [52] , a process mediated through activation of the polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2) ( Figure 3A ) [29] . Overall, these studies imply that the viral non-coding PAN RNA is a regulator of both viral and host gene expression.",

Recent studies have also demonstrated that these sites are associated with active transcription to produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) 0.5-5 kb in length [1, 22, 55, 56] . Of relevance, the recent release of the FAN-TOM 5 consortium has identified >43 000 eRNAs across 808 cells/tissues [57] . However, until recently it was unclear whether eRNAs represented transcriptional noise or were instrumental in mediating the action of the enhancer regions. To address this question, Lam et al. [58] investigated the role of eRNA transcription during Rev-Erb-a (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1; Nr1d1) and Rev-Erb-b (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 2; Nr1d2)-mediated gene repression in mouse macrophages, a process occurring through the recruitment of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NcoR)-HDAC3 to promoter and enhancer sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of Rev-Erb-a and b and subsequent sequencing showed that the majority (90%) of binding sites were located >1 kb from transcription start sites and within putative enhancer regions. Subsequent global run-on sequencing revealed that 76% of these enhancers were transcribed. To provide direct evidence that transcription of these eRNAs was linked to mRNA expression, these investigators focused on two eRNAs and their nearest neighbouring genes; Cx3cr1 and Mmp9. Knockdown of these eRNAs reduced expression of Cx3cr1 and Mmp9 but not that of other local genes ( Figure 3B ). Furthermore, cloning of the enhancer region revealed that although the core regions containing the transcription factor binding sites were able to enhance gene expression in cis, the magnitude of cis regulation was notably increased when the eRNA region was also cloned. Similarly, we recently described widespread expression of eRNAs following exposure of human monocytes to LPS and that LPS-induced expression of IL1B is dependent on a downstream eRNA that also appeared to regulate CXCL8 expression [13] .",

[59] examined the changes associated with the selection and activation of 3000 new enhancer regions following exposure to the TLR4 agonist, Kdo2-lipid A (KLA). This showed an initial interaction at the enhancer site between the TLR4-induced p65 component of NF-kB and the macrophage-specific transcription factors, PU.1 and C/EBP. However, the subsequent establishment of the enhancer region, through the acetylation of histone H4K5/8, was coupled to eRNA transcription.

            "text": "In concluding, we need to return to the question of whether lncRNAs are novel regulators of the immune response? As a starting point, investigators often address this question by using RNA sequencing to detect the differential expression of known and novel lncRNAs. However, as with all profiling studies, one of the great challenges is the identification of functionally relevant lncRNAs from the large lists that are commonly produced. This problem is compounded by the fact that lncRNAs generally demonstrate poor evolutionary sequence conservation, thereby preventing the use of this traditional approach for the identification of functionality. Interestingly, although this indicates that most lncRNAs are likely to be nonfunctional, even those lncRNAs that are known to be conserved across multiple species (such as Malat1, Cyrano, and Xist) are not reported using existing alignment programmes [6] . This has led to speculation that these algorithms, which are based upon whole-genome alignments, may be an inappropriate approach for detecting conservation in rapidly evolving lncRNAs. This underlines the need for better bioinformatics tools that can be employed to identify 'conserved' lncRNAs and their homologues [6] . Despite these limitations, cell-based studies have identified several lncRNAs that regulate the innate immune response. Importantly, these studies have also characterised their mechanism of action and, as this number increases, it is hoped that this information can be employed to refine the bioinformatics tools required for the identification of functional sequences and/or structural motifs. Given the complexity of the immune response, arguably the strongest evidence to support a role of lncRNAs would be provided by animal models of infection and/or disease. Indeed, animal models provide the only available approach for investigating many aspects of the acquired immune response. This therefore underlines the importance of the report by Gomez et al. [30] that demonstrated a role for NeST in a mouse model of viral and bacterial infection. However, the lack of conservation across species will once again represent a major hurdle to the standard approach of extrapolating from mouse to human.",

First, given the importance of miRNAs in the immune response [64] , it will be important to determine whether lncRNAs and miRNAs interact to regulate mRNA expression. This possibility is supported by reports showing that lncRNAs can reduce miRNA levels by acting either as sponges [19] or through base-pairing with primary miRNAs to block their processing into mature miRNAs [65] . Second, it has also been suggested that lncRNAs might actually code for peptides and small proteins [66, 67] , an intriguing prospect given the importance of peptides in the immune response [68, 69] .",

It is likely that there are many additional immune-related lncRNAs to be discovered and that these will act via multiple different mechanisms. Future studies will need to examine whether aberrant lncRNA expression is also linked to the development of autoimmune and allergic disease, as well as the inflammation associated with many chronic diseases. Indeed, several studies have reported differential expression of lncRNAs in various inflammatory conditions [15, [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] although further work is necessary to determine whether these have an active role in pathogenesis.",
