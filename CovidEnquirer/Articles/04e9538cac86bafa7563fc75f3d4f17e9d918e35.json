However, until now there has been no systematic analysis of typical characteristics of outbreaks, for which closure was considered necessary. This article presents data on features of such nosocomial epidemics published during the past 40 years in the medical literature. A search of the Outbreak Database (1561 nosocomial outbreaks in file) revealed a total of 194 outbreaks that ended up with some kind of closure of the unit (median closure time: 14 days). Closure rates (CRs) were calculated and stratified for medical departments, for causative pathogens, for outbreak sources, and for the assumed mode of transmission. Data were then compared to the overall average CR of 12.4% in the entire database. Wards in geriatric patient care were closed significantly more frequently (CR: 30.3%; P < 0.001) whereas paediatric wards showed a significantly lower CR (6.1%; P \u00bc 0.03). Pathogen species with the highest CR were norovirus (44.1%; P < 0.001) and influenza/parainfluenza virus (38.5%; P < 0.001). If patients were the source of the outbreak, the CR was significantly increased (16.7%; P \u00bc 0.03). Infections of the central nervous system were most often associated with closure of the ward (24.2%; P \u00bc 001). A systematic evaluation of nosocomial outbreaks can be a valuable tool for education of staff in the absence of an outbreak, but may",

The morbidity and the risk of mortality may increase. Additional antimicrobial treatment can become necessary and the duration of hospital stay may be prolonged. 3 (2) On the affected ward, the recognition of an outbreak often causes uncertainty about the outbreak's origin, the transmission route, and about appropriate infection control measures required to bring the outbreak to an end. Furthermore, almost every nosocomial outbreak will increase the costs for the affected medical department especially when a total closure of the unit is considered. That is why a total closure is performed only if all previous infection control measures have failed to control the pathogen's spread. This closure of the unit may comprise the immediate cessation of new admissions to the ward until disinfection of the ward has been carried out, but it may also include temporary cancellation of scheduled surgical operations or restriction of certain diagnostic procedures. 4e6 Sometimes the extent of a closure may vary within the course of one single outbreak. 7 (3) Publication of a nosocomial outbreak in public media may represent a threat for the reputation of the entire healthcare facility.",

Our analysis demonstrates that such an expensive measure is likely to be necessary in viral infections of the gastrointestinal (norovirus) or respiratory (influenza/parainfluenza) tract (Table II) . This may reflect the high transmissibility and low infectious dose of these pathogens. 10, 11 In addition, prolonged survival time of the outbreak strain in the environment may contribute to the likelihood of transmission, as it has been proposed in outbreaks due to Acinetobacter spp. 12 Closure of a department is usually considered much more often when it cares for older patients but less so on paediatric wards (Table I) . This can easily be explained by the confounding fact that most norovirus outbreaks take place on geriatric wards. In geriatric patients, it is especially difficult to implement sufficient infection control measures such as isolation in private rooms, and also to achieve a high compliance with alcohol-based hand rub. 13 In terms of the outbreak's source, we found that contaminated medical devices led significantly less often to the closure of the ward. Most probably these kinds of outbreaks stopped as soon as the device was identified as the source of the outbreak and were removed. By contrast, there was no such option for outbreaks in which infectious patients were responsible for the spread of the pathogen (Table III) . A similar explanation might be applicable for the findings on transmission by contact vs an invasive technique (Table IV) .",

            "text": "There are limitations to our analysis that must be borne in mind. (1) When performing a systematic analysis on medical literature, one has to rely on published data. However, most probably the majority of nosocomial outbreaks will not be published in the medical literature or will not even be recognized. Thus there will be some bias towards extraordinary species or towards common species that show a more antimicrobial-resistant phenotype. We believe that the large number of outbreaks filed already in the Outbreak Database balances this publication bias at least to some extent. (2) Some characteristics need a more detailed differentiation. For example, we cannot distinguish between the different kinds of hepatitis viruses, the various types of environmental source, or the sort of contact that occurred (direct or indirect by contaminated surfaces). More systematic analysis of nosocomial outbreaks needs to be performed to gain a better insight into the speciality of certain pathogens, possible sources of nosocomial outbreaks, and effective infection control measures. The Outbreak Database happens to be a very valuable tool for obtaining a quick overview on all kinds of outbreaks. It can therefore be used for education of staff to prevent the occurrence of an outbreak in the first place, but it may also be helpful when quick decisions need to be made during the investigation of a current epidemic.",
