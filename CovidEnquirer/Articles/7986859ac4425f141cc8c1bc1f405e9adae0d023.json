            "text": "Immunomodulation of natural polysaccharides has been the hot topic of research in recent years. In order to explore the immunomodulatory effect of Houttuynia cordata Thunb., the water extract was studied and a polysaccharide HCP-2 with molecular weight of 60,000 Da was isolated by chromatography using DEAE Sepharose CL-6B and Sephacryl S-400 HR columns. The structure characterization of HCP-2 was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), acidic hydrolysis, PMP derivation, HPLC analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (NMR). HCP-2 was elucidated as a pectic polysaccharide with a linear chain of 1,4-linked \u2423-d-galacturonic acid residues in which part of the 6-carboxyl groups were methyl esterified and part of 2-hydroxyl groups were acetylated. The bioactivity assays showed that HCP-2 could increase the secretions of interleukin-1\u2424 (IL-1\u2424), tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 (TNF-\u2423), macrophage inhibitory protein-1\u2423 (MIP-1\u2423), macrophage inhibitory protein-1\u2424 (MIP-1\u2424), and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which play critical roles in the innate immune system and shape the adaptive immunity. Our results implied that HCP-2 could be an immune enhancer.",

Some of them have been shown to possess immunepotentiating activities. For example, \u2424-glucans from Ganoderma lucidum, and Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) induce protective immune responses to prevent microbial invasion and eliminate malignant tumors (Brown & Gordon, 2001; Du et al., 2012) . Presumably, these polysaccharides bind to different receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) on macrophages, dendritic cells and other monocytes, and then activate them to release pro-inflammatory factors, cytokines and chemokines which help the host to constitute an intensive immune response (Shao et al., 2004) .",

The involvement of TLR-4 was assessed by measuring the levels of IL-1\u2424 in the supernatant. Freshly isolated human PBMCs were incubated with mixture of LPS-RS (0, 50 and 200 ng/ml) and HCP-2 (0.1, 1, 5, 10 and 25 g/ml). After 12 h incubation, the production of the IL-1\u2424 induced by HCP-2 was suppressed by LPS-RS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7) .",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation of a pure pectic polysaccharide from H. cordata with immunostimulating activities. Similar polysaccharides had been isolated from other species, and the differences lie in the molecular weight and optical rotation (Makarova et al., 2013; Shang et al., 2012; Xu, Dong, Qiu, Ma, & Ding, 2011; Zhao et al., 2006) .

            "text": "Pectic polysaccharides are the primary components of higher plant cell wall with intriguing structural diversity (Caffall & Mohnen, 2009) . Several literatures had reported that pectic polysaccharides exhibit immunomodulatory effects, such as complement fixation (Inngjerdingen et al., 2005) , promotion of the ratio of CD4 + /CD8 + T cells, and the stimulation of the secretion of cytokines and chemokines (Ye & Lim, 2010) . The previous studies on immunomodulation of H. cordata concentrated on the water and ethanolic extracts (Lau et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008) , and the study of the H. cordata polysaccharide was mainly on the antioxidant activities (Tian et al., 2011) . In our study, HCP-2 exhibited non-cytotoxicity at the range of 0.01-50 g/ml on human PBMCs in vitro (data not shown), and elicited strong responses on IL-1\u2424 and TNF-\u2423. As regards to the innate immunity, HCP-2 showed proinflammatory effects by stimulating monocyte functions, e.g., the production of TNF-\u2423 and IL-1\u2424, as well as the MIP-1\u2423, MIP-1\u2424, and RANTES. Upon the initiation of pathogen infection, the body requires a few days to develop and expand effector T and B cells. During this critical timeframe, innate immune responses play an important role in controlling the infection. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRR), such as Toll-like receptors of monocytes (especially macrophages and dendritic cells) recognize invasive pathogens, and immediately activate the innate immune to launch the immune and inflammatory responses. Macrophages and dendritic cells secrete pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1\u2424, TNF-\u2423) and chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1\u2423 and MIP-1\u2424) to recruit natural killer cells, monocytes and other immune cells for further pathogen elimination, and these cytokines and chemokines also assist in the shape of adaptive immune.",

After incubated with LPS-RS, a potent antagonist of TLR-4 for 12 h, the production of IL-1\u2424 caused by HCP-2 markedly decreased (Fig. 7) , which implied that HCP-2 may launch a series of the immune responses through activation of TLR-4 on the cell membrane of dendritic cells and macrophages.",
