Gene segments are derived from H9N2 viruses of poultry origin and the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene segments come from wild-bird origin H7 and N9 viruses, respectively. 1 71% of 131 reported cases have been in individuals older than 50 years, 3 and thus such patients seem more at risk of severe disease and death than are younger individuals. 4 The reasons for this disproportionate age distribution are largely unknown. It has been speculated that older individuals might have higher exposure to infected poultry, which could also be the reason why more men than women are aff ected. 5 However, many patients did not report contact with poultry, the incidence of H7N9 infl uenza virus infections in poultry seems very low, and the incidence of avian infl uenza A H5N1 virus infections was higher in younger than in older individuals within the same population, all of which argue against this possible explanation.",

Ageing is an important risk factor in viral respiratory tract infections (eg, caused by infl uenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and is associated with changes in immune function. 6 In elderly people, these infections can cause severe pneumonia triggered by exacerbated innate host responses, which was confi rmed experimentally in aged non-human primates. 7 However, the disease caused by H7N9 viruses resembles that caused by H5N1 viruses, and therefore changes in innate immunity are unlikely to be the only cause of the disproportionate age distribution.",

            "text": "We postulate that interference of pre-existing antibodies with infection of elderly people by pandemic A H1N1 virus might have had negative eff ects. It might have prevented the induction of recall cross-reactive virus-specifi c T-cell response, which could contribute to heterosubtypic immunity. Rapid and strong CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were recorded in individuals infected with the pandemic A H1N1 virus, 12 which might have been absent in older patients as a result of protective pre-existing antibodies to pandemic A H1N1 virus, resulting in higher susceptibility to infection with H7N9 virus (fi gure). Similarly, yearly vaccination of highrisk patients against seasonal infl uenza prevented the induction of virus-specifi c CD8 T-cell responses, which would usually be induced by natural infection with seasonal infl uenza viruses 13 and was noted in animal models. 14 A possible explanation is that the presence of cross-reactive antibodies predisposed for more severe disease, a fi nding that, although not previously noted in infl uenza, has been reported for some viral diseases. 15 During the infl uenza pandemic of 1957, which was caused by the H2N2 subtype, individuals who had previously been infected with the H1N1 virus were less likely to be infected with H2N2 infl uenza than were those who had not. 16 The low incidence of severe H5N1 infections in elderly compared with younger people might be related to the presence of cross-protective antibodies to neuraminidase that are induced by seasonal infl uenza A H1N1 viruses. 17 Overall, we postulate that antibodies to pre-1957 infl uenza A H1N1 viruses protected elderly people against pandemic A H1N1 virus infection, but consequently aff ected the development of heterosubtypic immunity and the disease outcome of H7N9 virus infections. The rate and timing of pandemic A H1N1 virus infections might have revealed the diff erences in H7N9 disease outcome, by contrast with historical infections with seasonal infl uenza A H3N2 viruses. This counterproductive imprinting of immunity might increase susceptibility to H7N9 virus infection. For that reason, older individuals should be given priority for vaccination if sustained person-to-person transmission of H7N9 viruses emerges. To obtain a better understanding of the role of imprinting of the adaptive immune system in H7N9 disease severity, prospective cohort studies in which cross-reactive T-cell immunity and virus-specifi c serum antibodies are tested for are imperative before possible wider spread of the virus. Community-acquired pneumonia is a life-threatening disease. An estimated 8% of patients are admitted to intensive care and overall estimated 30 day mortality is 4-11%. 1 Many bacteria and viruses cause community-acquired pneumonia (and can co-infect), and the causative pathogen (or pathogens) cannot be predicatively identifi ed by any clinical, radiological, or biological methods. 2 Accordingly, antibiotic treatment is empirical, and guidelines recommend a combination of a \u03b2 lactam with a macrolide. 2, 3 Identifi cation of the causative pathogen is usually delayed because clinical specimens are processed in a core laboratory, which is often in a diff erent centre from the patient and the doctor. Culturing, if done, can also take several days.",
