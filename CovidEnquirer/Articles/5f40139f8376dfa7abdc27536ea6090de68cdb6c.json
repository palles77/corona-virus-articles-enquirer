A pair of primers (P1/P2) was used to detect both CDV wild-type strains and vaccines. Another pair (P3/P4) was used to detect only CDV wild-type strains. A 335 bp fragment was amplified from the genomic RNA of the vaccine and wild-type strains. A 555 bp fragment was amplified specifically from the genomic RNA of the wild-type strains. No amplification was achieved for the uninfected cells, cells infected with canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, or canine adenovirus. The combined RT-PCR method detected effectively and differentiated the CDV wild-type and vaccine strains by two separate RT-PCRs. The method can be used for clinical detection and epidemiological surveillance. The phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of the local wild-type CDV strains revealed that the seven local isolates all belonged to the Asia-1 lineage, and were clustered closely with one another at the same location. These results suggested that the CDV genotype Asia-1 is circulating currently in domestic dogs in China.",

PCR products of the correct size (2023 bp long) were amplified and cloned into the pMD 18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). For each CDV strain, 3-5 positive recombinant plasmids were sequenced in both directions using primer M13. Additional primers selected based on the obtained sequences were provided by the Shanghai Invitrogen Biotechnology Company (Shanghai, China).",

The numbering starts at the position nucleotide 961 and 1441 of the H gene. Only amino acids that differ from the majority sequence are shown. identical residues are represented by dots. The substitution of the AG and A present in the field strains, which was used to design the differentiating primers for RT-PCR, is indicated by a square box. ",

GenBank accession numbers of the reference strains are as follow: CDV3 (DQ778941), Onderstepoort (AF378705), Convac (Z35493), SnyderHill (AF259552), Yanaka (D85755), Ueno (D85753), Hamamatsu (D85754), Dog98-002 (AB025270), Dog5B (AY297453), DogHM-3 (AB040767), Dog5VD (AY297454), DogTaiwan (AY378091), DogisolateADen (AF478543), DogisolateCDen (AF478547), Dog Denmark (Z47761), US89 (Z47764), Africa 1bn (FJ461713), Africa 4sp (FJ461715), dog GR88 (Z47760), dog 179-94 (DQ226087), 01-2676 (AY498692), 01-2690 (AY465925), H06Ny12HU (DQ889189)and 207/00 IT (DQ228166).",
