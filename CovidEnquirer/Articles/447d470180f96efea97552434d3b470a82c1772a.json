The setting was an emergency room (ER) in a large tertiary hospital and included primary and secondary MERS patients. Methods: Rapid response teams conducted repeated assessments of IPC and monitored implementation of corrective measures using a detailed structured checklist. We ascertained the epidemiologic link between patients and calculated the secondary attack rate per 10,000 patients visiting the ER (SAR/ 10,000) in 3 phases of the outbreak. Results: In phase I, 6 primary cases gave rise to 48 secondary cases over 4 generations, including a case that resulted in 9 cases in the first generation of secondary cases and 21 cases over a chain of 4 generations. During the second and third phases, the number of secondary cases sharply dropped to 18 cases and 1 case, respectively, from a comparable number of primary cases. The SAR/10,000 dropped from 75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55-99) in phase I to 29 (95% CI, 17-46) and 3 (95% CI, 0-17) in phases II and III, respectively. Conclusions: The study demonstrated salient evidence that proper institution of IPC measures during management of an outbreak of MERS could remarkably change the course of the outbreak.",

            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an epidemicprone viral disease with a high case fatality rate and ill-defined mode of transmission. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Currently, there is no safe and effective vaccine and chemoprophylaxis for the disease. 7 Major outbreaks of symptomatic MERS occurred in some major health facilities; these outbreaks were attributed to inadequate adherence of health care workers (HCWs) to infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines. [8] [9] [10] Screening of HCWs and inpatients during outbreaks using polymerase chain reaction and serologic tests revealed more asymptomatic cases of MERS infections. 11 The role of HCWs with asymptomatic infections in further spreading the disease and amplification of outbreaks is not fully understood. 12 Preventing transmission of MERS in hospitals requires increased awareness of HCWs about the disease, triaging and isolation of patients who might have MERS infection, early detection, adherence to standard IPC procedures, and protocols and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially when performing aerosol-generating procedures. 6, 13 Successful implementation of IPC measures depends on the presence of clear administrative policies and organizational leadership that promotes and facilitates adherence to IPC guidelines within the health care settings, including HCWs, patients, and visitors to the admitted patients. 14 An outbreak of MERS occurred in an emergency room (ER) of a large tertiary hospital in Riyadh City (LTHR), Saudi Arabia; the ER has 150 beds and >1,000 HCWs. 12 The aim of this article is to demonstrate the outcome of strict implementation of IPC measures during the outbreak of MERS.",

The main objective of the RRT is to ensure that all health care facilities are complying with Ministry of Health IPC guidelines and receive timely and appropriate technical support and supplies as deemed necessary. The RRT visits the health facilities, conducts independent assessments, audits IPC measures, and assesses the performances of the IPC team and HCWs. The RRT assesses the IPC performance within health facilities using a detailed structured checklist composed of 10 elements (approximately 125 specific observations). Each element is given a score of 0-2, depending on whether the health facility was fully, partially, or noncompliant. By the end of each visit, the RRT develops action plans with the hospital management to be immediately implemented.",

We used Microsoft Excel 2013 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) for data entry; Epi Info 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) was used for analysis of data and plotting epidemic curves for the outbreak. The collected data were used to construct 2 detailed chronologic time lines for each patient using 3-and 24-hour intervals to illustrate the dynamics of movements and outcome of patients throughout their stay in the hospital. We divided the outbreak into 3 phases based on the awareness of HCWs and implementation of IPC measures. At the beginning of the outbreak (phase I), there was inadequate awareness of HCWs at the LTHR about emergence of an outbreak of MERS in the hospital. When the hospital administration became aware about the increased number of MERS cases, additional but inadequate IPC measures were put in place (phase II). Toward the end of the outbreak (phase III), strict IPC measures were implemented. Then, the LTHR management decided to close the ER, suspend elective surgeries, and postpone all outpatient appointments and visits. 12 We obtained the number of patients that visited the ER seeking medical care during each phase of the outbreak. We calculated the crude secondary attack rate per 10,000 patients (SAR/ 10,000). SAR/10,000 was defined as the number of MERS cases that occurred within 14 days among patients visiting the ER for medical care after exposure to a primary or secondary case.",

Paradoxically, more time was needed to confirm the diagnosis of MERS, probably because the laboratory was overtasked with an increased number of laboratory requests.

Similar infections have been seen in other MERS outbreaks. 16 One of the secondary cases was exposed to a case of MERS while he was in the ER and developed symptoms after he was moved to a ward within the hospital. He was tested 7 times over 4 weeks to confirm MERS diagnosis. As a result, he infected another patient within the ward and probably some HCWs. This incident highlights the importance of collection of a proper MERS test type, time, or technique. 17 There were no secondary cases that could be linked to the very first primary case of MERS reported to the ER, probably because of the low infectivity of the virus. 18 In addition, the first primary MERS case diagnosed at the LTHR was not subjected to aerosol-generating procedure during his relatively short stay in ER, which act in spreading the virus because MERS-CoV virus affects the lower lobes of the lungs and spreads through droplets. 19 Breakdown of the outbreak into 3 phases revealed some differences in management of cases of MERS related to case definition and implementation IPC measures. It is clear that IPC measures started to improve in phase II and were thoroughly implemented in phase III. Based on the course of the outbreak, it is most likely that closure of the ER was unnecessary because the number of secondary cases in phase III is almost zero. Closure of ERs to new admission during outbreaks has been reported elsewhere to prevent occurrence of additional cases when the source of transmission was unknown and the decision was made only in consultation with public health authorities. 20 Secondary MERS cases were detected relatively in shorter periods after their onset of symptoms, biologic specimens were taken faster, and confirmed cases were moved away relatively quicker from the ER to other wards within the hospital in phase III. This is most probably because of the increased awareness of HCWs about the MERS case definition. During phase III, IPC demonstrated improved IPC practice. It is difficult to estimate the contribution of each IPC element or intervention separately. The increase in the number of identified HCWs infected with MERS toward the end of the outbreak does not necessarily correlate to the date or the phase of the outbreak when they were infected. HCWs who tested positive for MERS in 3 different phases of the outbreak were counted as secondary cases, but we did not exclude them when we calculated the SAR/10,000, simply because it was not possible to link these secondary cases to specific primary MERS cases. If secondary MERS cases among HCWs were included, the SAR/10,000 would be even higher. Moreover, the secondary cases among HCWs were mostly detected toward the end of the outbreak during phase III after screening of HCWs, whereas reporting of primary cases continued to the date of its closure. The lesson learned from this outbreak is that continuous IPC assessment, audits, training, and supervision of HCWs and awareness of case definitions are crucial for reducing the number of secondary cases during outbreaks of MERS.
