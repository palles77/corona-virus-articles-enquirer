Design: A prospective observational study. Setting: A medical center in Taiwan. Participants: Two hundred thirty HCWs. Intervention: NPS examination for the presence of SARS-CoV by two nested reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Measurements and results: During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), NPS polymerase chain reaction screening of HCWs for SARS-CoV was performed. SARS-CoV was examined by two nested RT-PCRs and a quantitative RT-PCR. Serum-specific antibodies were assessed by enzyme immunoassay and indirect immunofluorescence. We monitored 230 HCWs, including 217 first-line HCWs and 13 non-first-line HCWs. One hundred ninety first-line HCWs and 13 non-first-line HCWs had negative results in both nested RT-PCR assays. Two first-line HCWs who were positive on both nested RT-PCR assays had SARS. They had 16,900 \u060e 7,920 copies (mean \u060e SD) of RNA per milliliter in the NPS and had detectable anti-SARS antibodies. The remaining 25 first-line HCWs were negative for the first nested RT-PCR but positive for the second nested RT-PCR. Their corresponding titers were 338 \u060e 227 copies of RNA per milliliter; antibodies developed in none of these 25 HCWs. The expression and function of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 were not different among these HCWs. This study shows that colonization of SARS-CoV occurred in 25 of 217 well-protected first-line HCWs on a SARS-associated service, but they remained seronegative. Conclusion: With the second RT-PCR assay more sensitive than the first RT-PCR assay, we are able to show that approximately 11.5% of well-protected HCWs exposed to SARS patients or specimens may have colonization without seroconversion. Only those with significant clinical symptoms or disease would have active immunity. Thus, regular NPS screening for nested RT-PCR assays in conjunction with a daily recording of body temperature in all first-line HCWs may provide an effective way of early detection.",

To prevent nosocomial spread of SARS, additional preventive measurements were implemented for the firstline HCWs in Mackay Memorial Hospital, including centralized accommodation for off-duty HCWs and the early detection of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by performing nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing.

The Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taiwan is a 2,000-bed teaching hospital that employs 4,500 physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and clerical staff members. Between April 27 and June 16, 2003 , there were 96 suspected SARS patients and 71 probable SARS patients treated in our hospital. During this period, we monitored 230 HCWs, including 217 first-line HCWs and 13 non-first-line HCWs. The first-line HCWs were those with close contact with SARS patients, including medical staff in the emergency department, SARS ward, respiratory care units, and personnel who manage laboratory specimens from SARS patients. Other employees were classified as non-first-line HCWs if they had no contact history with SARS patients or specimens; this included housekeeping staff and transporting personnel. The first-line HCWs attending to patients with suspected or probable SARS were required to wear gloves, gowns, goggles, and N-95 masks. All participants were required to complete questionnaires describing their workplace, contact history with SARS patients or specimens, and symptoms experienced during the study period. Mild symptoms are defined as clinical symptoms that do not require medical treatment or can be treated with over-the-counter medications. Since the titer of SARS-CoV was noticed to increase in nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients between day 5 and day 10 as reported by Peiris et al, 7 we decided to perform NPS screening of the first-line HCWs at the end of 1 week of SARS-associated service. The subjects with initially positive NPS results were required to stay isolated in the centralized dormitory until the repeat sampling results became negative and/or the subject had no fever for 3 days. The first serum sample was drawn at the 30-to 48-day interval, and the second sample was collected at the 64-to 78-day interval after the NPS was obtained. Baseline samples had been drawn from HCWs for the serologic test before their SARS-associated service. Anonymous processing of samples was performed to preserve the confidentiality of the HCWs. The critical laboratory information was only reported to the superintendents of medical technicians, nurses, and physicians.",

The extracted viral RNA of each specimen was resuspended in 100 L of ribonuclease-free water. The RNA was reversely transcribed with random hexamers (Abgene; UK), and reactions contained 12.5 L of 2 \u03eb buffer concentrate, 3.6 mmol/L of magnesium sulfate, 0.5 L of each primer, 0.5 L of reverse transcriptase/Taq DNA polymerase mixture, and 5 L of RNA in a total volume of 25 L. The complementary DNA of every specimen was subjected to both the first and second nested RT-PCR assays. The first nested RT-PCR assay used the primer pairs IN-6/IN-7 and Cor-p-F2/Cor-p-R1. Within the open reading frame 1b of the coronavirus polymerase gene, the 440 base-pair (bp) segment was amplified with a broadly reactive genus-specific primer pair, IN-6 (\u03e9) 5\u0408GGTTGGGACTATC-CTAAGTGTGA3\u0408 and IN-7 (\u03ea) 5\u0408CCATCATCAGATAGAAT-CATCATA3\u0408. The complementary DNA was further amplified with a SARS-specific primer pair Cor-p-F2 (\u03e9) 5\u0408CTAACAT-GCTTAGGATAATGG3\u0408 and Cor-p-R1 (\u03ea) 5\u0408CAGGTAAGCG-TAAAACTCATC3\u0408. The size of the first nested RT-PCR product was 368 bp (lane 2, Fig 1) . Similarly, a duplicate aliquot of complementary DNA for each specimen was also amplified with the second nested RT-PCR using the sets of primers Cor-p-F2/ Cor-p-R1 and then Cor-p-F3/Cor-p-R2.

The size of the second nested RT-PCR product was 306 bp (lane 4, Fig 1) . Positive and negative RT-PCR controls were included in each run. The specificity of nested RT-PCR was confirmed by sequencing the positive amplified products obtained through agarose gel electrophoretic separation and compared with the reference sequence of SARS-CoV. 8 Thermocycling of reaction mixtures was completed in a thermocycler (model 2400; Perkin Elmer-Applied Biosystems) pro-grammed for 40 cycles (30 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 55\u00b0C, and 45 s at 72\u00b0C) followed by a 7-min incubation at 72\u00b0C.",

Another possibility that ACE-2 might be inducible by febrile condition was studied by Western immunoblotting and flow cytometry examination of PBMCs at different temperatures. As Figure 2 shows, ACE-2 expression of PBMCs was similar among all subjects either at 37\u00b0C or 40\u00b0C. A functional study by a binding assay showed that PBMCs did not bind the recombinant spike-1, 2, 3-Fc protein, even after cultured at 40\u00b0C for 24 h.

Facing the uncertainty of its transmission pattern at that time, we hoped to detect individuals with infection early during the incubation period. Thus, Mackay Memorial Hospital practiced additional safety measures, including centralized accommodation for first-line HCWs and regular NPS screening for SARS-CoV. This extra precaution seemed to block successfully further contagion by isolating 27 individuals who might possibly become transmission sources-in particular, those 2 individuals with significantly higher titers of virus. Although all 25 infected individuals with positive results of the second nested RT-PCR only had negative findings on the follow-up NPS screen and did not acquire SARS, it is possible that these individuals could still have been contagious while carrying low amounts of the virus. In contrast, the individuals who had higher titers of the virus were more likely to acquire clinical SARS and demonstrate a persistent high fever. This suggests that regular NPS screening for SARS-CoV may be more practical in conjunction with daily recording of body temperature.",

During the early screening period, the positive results of the second nested RT-PCR detected in a significant number of HCWs were really worrisome to us. A false-positivity of the nested RT-PCR was unlikely because negative and positive control samples were also simultaneously performed for every run. Retrospectively, the negative results of both nested RT-PCR tests presented by all of 13 non-first-line HCWs who had no contact history with SARS also support the absence of false-positivity.

Those HCWs who were either mildly symptomatic or had low titers of virus in NPS screening did not become SARS patients by clinical criteria. This experience was somewhat different from the study reported by Ho et al 5 in Singapore. In their study, although no asymptomatic HCW was found by serologic testing to have SARS-associated coronaviral infection, antibodies to SARS-CoV developed in 3.2% of mildly symptomatic HCWs. By contrast, Chow et al 6 showed that HCWs with positive neutralizing antibodies had symptoms indicative of SARS. None of the HCWs with nonspecific symptoms showed serologic evidence of subclinical infection. SARS demonstrates a spectrum of infection, hence the detection of low-titer colonization of SARS-CoV without seroconversion in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic HCWs is to be expected. The findings in our study confirm that a low-level transmission of virus is less likely to trigger epidemics, as previously suggested by Peiris et al. 7 Our results demonstrated that individuals with infection/colonization detected by the second nested RT-PCR with lower titers of virus not only remained healthy but also seronegative. Since the serologic test is commonly perceived as a \"gold standard\" in the diagnosis of viral infection, the above observation has raised a dilemma of whether these HCWs actually had SARS-CoV infection. Similar observations have been noticed in areas affected by SARS. For example, the cumulative numbers of probable cases in Taiwan and the world were 671 and 8,437, respectively, from November 1, 2002, to July 11, 2003, 13 and this has been reclassified to 346 and 8,098, respectively, on September 26, 2003. 1 These patients were reclassified if they had a positive RT-PCR or a positive serologic conversion. These data revealed that some of the patients with positive RT-PCR results were indeed negative for seroconversion. 14 Our previous data also revealed that 63 of the 346 reported SARS cases (10.7%) in Taiwan did not have an appropriate seroconversion despite having a positive RT-PCR result (Mei-Shang Ho; unpublished data). It is possible that these HCWs had been exposed to the amounts of SARS-CoV that were not adequate to elicit an effective immune response, similar to the situation occurring after vaccination. 15 This is the first time for such a finding that by using a more sensitive technique, we have found that HCWs exposed to patients with SARS may have colonization without seroconversion. In other words, it suggests that the virus is not replicating within our tissue since no IgG or IgM antibody response is detected. The detection of subclinical viral colonization as evidenced in the NPS specimens that were collected prospectively and assayed with a more sensitive nested RT-PCR procedure is an important finding, as a result of the implemented of our stringent hospital policy. Why the small amount of SARS-CoV detected by NPS remained temporarily in some HCWs and failed to invade the host might be related to several factors discussed below.",

Although the mechanism of active viral disease developing from the colonized status is not fully understood, pathogenic factors such as the initial viral load may play an important role as suggested by our results. First, host factors need be considered. It has been reported that total secretory IgA is significantly associated with reduction of symptoms; total protein in nasal washings has been suggested to protect against infection and may be associated with resistance in human coronavirus 229E infection. 16 Genetic predisposition such as specific human leukocyte antigen types has been shown to contribute to the different clinical outcomes following SARS-CoV infection. 17 Secondly, the expression and function of ACE-2 may also help to explain the spectrum of SARS reactions. In November 2003, this metallopeptidase was identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV in mediating cell entry and fusion. 18 The selection of PBMCs in our study was based on availability and the inaccessibility to collect a large amount of other cell types that possess high levels of ACE-2. Even though PBMCs have been considered as devoid of ACE-2, 19 we have shown that ACE-2 expression can be detected using Western immunoblotting. In addition to examining the basal expression of ACE-2 from PBMCs, we have found that the expression and function of ACE-2 in PBMCs were not inducible by culturing at the higher temperature, suggesting that fever may not increase the likelihood of developing SARS. Our results did not demonstrate any significant difference in the ACE-2 expression and function of the subjects, but these results may not necessarily apply to other cell types. Due to the difference of ACE-2 distribution in various tissues and the inability to show a positive binding assay, we cannot conclude its exact role in the severity of SARS. Further studies are needed to draw firmer conclusions about the relationship of host factors to the outcome of SARS.",

Thus, regular NPS screening for nested RT-PCR testing in conjunction with a daily recording of body temperature in all first-line HCWs may provide an effective way of early detection. Although all HCWs detected by the second nested RT-PCR did not acquire SARS, there is no assurance whether these individuals carrying low amounts of the virus were capable of transmitting the virus to susceptible individuals.
