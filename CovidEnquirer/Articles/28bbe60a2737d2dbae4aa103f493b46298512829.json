H5 DNA priming was safe and enhanced H5-specifi c antibody titres following an H5N1 MIV boost, especially when the interval between DNA prime and MIV boost was extended to 24 weeks. In the two studies, DNA priming with a 24-week MIV boost interval induced protective HAI titres in 21 (81%) of 26 of individuals, with an increase in geometric mean titre (GMT) of more than four times that of individuals given the MIV-MIV regimen at 4 or 24 weeks (GMT 103-206 vs GMT 27-33). Additionally, neutralising antibodies directed to the conserved stem region of H5 were induced by this prime-boost regimen in several individuals.

Such episodes occurred in 1918, when the infl uenza A subtype H1N1 was fi rst identifi ed in human beings, causing the Spanish fl u pandemic, with mortality estimated at 40 million deaths or more worldwide 2 and again in 2009, when a related H1N1 virus caused a pandemic derived by a triple reassortment of genes from swine, avian, and human infl uenza viruses. [3] [4] [5] This type of adaptation of animal infl uenza viruses to man represents a global threat to public health. 6 Another example of zoonotic spread includes the highly pathogenic avian infl uenza A H5N1 viruses, which cause morbidity and mortality in bird populations and have caused sporadic human disease. WHO, as of June 16, 2011, has reported 561 confi rmed human H5N1 cases and 328 deaths. 7 In addition to representing a highly pathogenic strain, the absence of background H5N1 immunity in the general population makes the H5 antigen ideal for the assessment of novel infl uenza vaccine approaches.",

These antibodies are directed against well defi ned antigenic sites in the globular head region of infl uenza haemagglutinin, and are largely strain-specifi c. 8, 9 HAI titres of 1:40 or more are typically associated with at least a 50% reduction in the risk of infection with strain specifi c infl uenza viruses in human beings. 10 By contrast, neutralising antibody assays detect functional antibodies with the capacity to inhibit viral entry into cells. In the case of infl uenza, neutralising antibodies can be specifi c for the head of haemagglutinin or directed against a conserved region in the stem of haemagglutinin and are able to neutralise multiple subtypes of infl uenza. Specifi cally, a localised region of the haemagglutinin stem has been identifi ed as an important antigenic site capable of inducing broadly neutralising antibodies. [11] [12] [13] This region is highly conserved among group 1 infl uenza type A viruses (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, and H16). 12 Although neutralising stem-specifi c haemagglutinin antibodies have been identifi ed in man, 11, 12, 14, 15 such stem antibody responses have not been elicited by vaccination. A vaccine regimen that could induce antibodies against a conserved antigenic target would represent an important step toward universal infl uenza vaccine development.",

Because of the background response due to previous infection with H1 and H3 viruses, we addressed this question with DNA vaccine encoding H5 as a priming vaccine (prime) followed by an H5N1 monovalent inactivated vaccine (MIV; boost) in phase 1 safety and immunogenicity studies. We tested the ability of this prime-boost regimen to induce improved antibody responses against autologous virus, heterologous virus, and to a conserved haemagglutinin stem epitope. VRC 306 was initiated in November, 2008, to assess the potential of DNA to prime for an MIV boost. The study fully enrolled in November, 2009, and preliminary data indicated a need to enrol two more groups to confi rm the fi ndings. VRC 310 was initiated in March, 2010, and included two groups designed to validate the fi ndings in VRC 306. VRC 306 and VRC 310 were both designed to examine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an investigational infl uenza DNA vaccine encoding H5 (H5 DNA) boosted with MIV subvirion H5N1 vaccine, in healthy adults aged 18-60 years with no history of H5 infl uenza vaccination, a body-mass index lower than 40, normal baseline blood counts, and normal liver and renal function laboratory measurements. The studies were reviewed and approved by the NIAID Institutional Review Board. Individuals provided written informed consent and completed a study specifi c assessment of understanding before enrolment. We followed human experimental guidelines for conducting clinical research from the US Department of Health and Human Services. ",

We confi rmed the specifi city of these antisera using a competition ELISA assay in which haemagglutinin binding was done in the presence of 9E8 (anti-head) or F10 (anti-stem) antibodies. In this assay, binding to haemagglutinin was inhibited by the anti-stem antibody F10 but not the control anti-head antibody 9E8 (fi gure 3A). We assessed the ability of the sera from these individuals to neutralise heterologous strains of virus on an unmatched distant low pathogenicitiy H5N2 (A/mallard/Pennsylvania/ 12180/1984, 1984 Penn) and on a diff erent subtype, H9N2 (A/Hong Kong/1074/1999, 1999 HK) in three representative individuals (fi gure 3B). Post-immune but not pre-immune sera neutralised the unrelated 1984 Penn virus and two of these individuals also neutralised the alternative subtype 1999 HK virus (fi gure 3C), documenting the increased breadth of these immune sera. Furthermore, wild-type H5 (Indo) haemagglutinin but not \u0394Stem trimer protein blocked neutralisation against each strain (fi gure 3B, C; lower panels, wildtype vs \u0394Stem), again showing that anti-stem neutralising antibodies were induced by vaccination in these individuals (webappendix pp [7] [8] .",

            "text": "In this report, we analyse the ability of a H5 DNA vaccine to prime the neutralising antibody response elicited by an MIV H5N1 (Indo) boost. These regimens were safe and well tolerated, adding to the growing body of data that DNA vaccines carry a favourable safety profi le. The safety data from the assessments of this H5 DNA vaccine are consistent with previous data generated by the Vaccine Research Centre using the same platform to assess vaccines for HIV, Ebola, Marburg, West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and seasonal infl uenza, in which 2100 individuals have been immunised with a total of 5700 doses of DNA vaccines. 17, 18, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] We have shown that the length of the interval between priming and boosting signifi cantly aff ects the magnitude and breadth of the response and that DNA priming increases the potency of the responses. In some individuals, DNA priming can also increase breadth by eliciting antibodies directed to a highly conserved structure in the haemagglutinin stem. 11,31 DNA priming followed by MIV with a 24-week boost interval induced HAI titres more than four times higher than did two doses of MIV. Similar to other H5 antigens, this antigen generally induces low-titre and low-frequency HAI responses compared with seasonal infl uenza strain vaccine antigens. The DNA vaccine assessed in this study has previously been shown to induce an HAI titre of 1:40 or more in just 20% of individuals when given three times at a 4 mg dose without an inactivated vaccine boost. 32 Similarly, when given twice, the MIV boost product assessed in this study was recently shown by another group 33 to induce an HAI GMT of 27\u00b76, and, although a 6-month boost interval improved those responses slightly (GMT 58\u00b77), little or no cross-reactive antibody was induced. 33 In the data from two clinical studies reported here, when a single DNA prime was boosted by MIV at 24 weeks, protective (\u22651/40) HAI titres were induced in 81% of individuals with a GMT of 152 (groups 3 and B), which is a frequency and magnitude much greater than those previously induced by either vaccine alone. MIV given twice induced a protective HAI titre in six of 15 individuals in group 1, and in four of nine in group A. This fi nding is remarkable because of the relatively weak immunogenicity of the H5 antigen and because only one dose of DNA priming was needed to greatly improve the antibody response. Moreover, the longer boost interval signifi cantly improved the responses seen in the DNA primed groups, but did not signifi cantly improve the responses in individuals who received two doses of MIV. This result indicates that the biology of the priming immunisation diff ers between DNA and a traditional inactivated vaccine. Another surprising fi nding was that two doses of DNA as a prime did not greatly improve the overall responses beyond those seen with a single-dose of DNA. The two-dose DNA prime did aff ect the ELISA and neutralising antibody response but had no signifi cant eff ect on the HAI response, which is known to correlate with protection. Gene-based antigen delivery accesses diff erent pathways of antigen presentation and might thereby facilitate T-cell help, increase the number and diversity of CD4 clones, 34 and induce greater expansion of the relevant B-cell populations. DNA prime-inactivated vaccine boost has been shown to elicit higher haemagglutinin-specifi c T-cell responses compared with inactivated vaccine alone in animals, supporting the fi ndings in this study.",

This confi rmed that the DNA primed group had higher HAI titres after MIV at 24 weeks compared directly to MIV-MIV with a 24 week interval. activity of neutralising antibodies, induced by an infl uenza vaccine should translate to improved effi cacy. The present fi ndings suggest that DNA priming could substantially augment the responses otherwise seen with traditional H5 MIV vaccine approaches, and that gene-based regimens may also provide an opportunity to induce broader and potentially more potent neutralising antibodies, especially if a response can be induced against conserved infl uenza epitopes such as to the stem of haemagglutinin. A longer boost interval might provide an optimum immune response and allow for more fl exibility in an immunisation schedule.
