            "text": "Acute pharyngitis may be caused by a wide variety of microbial agents, but some of the most common and potentially dangerous microorganisms are group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). Lancefield group A consists of a single species, S. pyogenes. GABHS are gram-positive bacteria that grow in culture as pairs or chains of variable length. They cause complete hemolysis of red blood cells on sheep blood agar and grow as transparent to opaque, round, small colonies. The pathogenesis of GABHS is mediated by a variety of factors, including streptolysins O and S; steptokinase; DNases; proteases; pyrogenic exotoxins A, B, and C; and a hyaluronic acid capsule that protects the organism from phagocytosis. Streptolysins O and S are toxins that damage cell membranes and account for the hemolysis demonstrated on sheep blood agar. In addition to pharyngitis, GABHS are also one of the etiologic agents of impetigo, cellulitis, and scarlet fever. However, it is as a cause of pharyngitis that GABHS can be the most dangerous because of the postinfection syndromes of acute rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.",

At this time, infections caused by GABHS and the sequelae of such infections declined markedly in industrialized nations. No changes in the epidemiologic pattern for developing nations were seen, however. 1 During the past 10 years, this discrepancy has changed. For the first time in many decades, reports of individual cases and even outbreaks of acute rheumatic fever were reported from various parts of the United States. For example, \u03fe270 cases of acute rheumatic fever occurred in the Salt Lake City, Utah area between 1985 and the end of 1992. 1 Outbreaks have been documented at military training centers, and surveys among pediatric cardiologists indicate significant increases in rheumatic fever in half of the 50 states. The most disturbing fact is that mortality has been \u03fe30% in some reported series. The reason for this sudden increase in GABHS infection has not been completely elucidated. One prominent theory suggests the emergence of dominant serotypes of bacteria that produce virulent clones. These clones cause outbreaks by producing specific virulence factors and thus escape the host defense mechanisms.",

The skin and anus also are potential sites, as evidenced by foodborne outbreaks of disease. Contact with contaminated objects, such as toothbrushes, is probably not important in the spread of the organism. This observation was confirmed by a recent study examining possible treatment failures caused by reinfection from a patient's toothbrush or bedclothes. Of 114 patients with documented GABHS, 54 patients and their families were given hygienic precautions, including the use of new toothbrushes and frequent changing of bedclothes. No difference in treatment failure rates was found between the groups. 5 The incubation period of streptococcal pharyngitis is 1 to 4 days, leading to a self-limited, localized inflammation of the tonsillopharynx lasting 3 to 5 days. Symptoms include sore throat, fever and chills, malaise, and occasionally abdominal complaints and vomiting, especially in children. Both symptoms and signs are quite variable, ranging from mild sore throat with minimal physical findings to high fever and severe pain. Pain may be associated with intense erythema and swelling of the pharyngeal mucosa and the presence of purulent exudates over the posterior pharyngeal wall and tonsillar pillars. Exudative pharyngitis may be associated with enlarged, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes. Notable is the absence of rhinorrhea and cough. Infection with GABHS most typically occurs in midwinter to early spring. When the above constellation of symptoms is present, the likelihood of infection approaches 60 -70% in children and 20 -30% in adolescents. 4",

The gold standard diagnostic test remains the throat culture. The specimen must be properly collected by vigorously rubbing a sterile swab over both tonsillar pillars, placing the swab in an appropriate culture medium, and then transporting the specimen to the laboratory in a timely manner. Although this test is the most sensitive and specific means available to make a diagnosis, a major disadvantage is the delay in obtaining results. Delay can range from 18 -48 hours. Another disadvantage is the inability of the test to differentiate between an acute infection and a chronic state.

Numerous kits are available that use techniques such as agglutination and enzyme immunoassay to detect GABHS carbohydrate in a matter of minutes. The most recent tests employ nucleic acid hybridization techniques. Although these rapid assays are highly specific, a disadvantage is their lower sensitivity compared with routine throat culture. A recent comparison of three second-generation immune assays for detection of GABHS showed similar sensitivities and specificities. 7 Strep A Plus had an 84.2% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity, Concise Strep A an 82.4% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity, and Cards Plus, an 84.2% sensitivity and 90.7% specificity. Thus, it is recommended that a negative rapid test be confirmed with a throat culture. However, findings show that with a positive rapid test, it is reasonable to start antibiotic treatment without performing a bacterial culture. These recommendations are particularly important when treating children. In adults, the low prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis leads to an increase in false-positive results, with subsequent unnecessary antibiotic treatment.",

To date, no GABHS have been documented as resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. GABHS are also highly susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalosporins. Another family of antibiotics that is effective against GABHS is the macrolides, specifically erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, lincomycin, and clindamycin. GABHS can develop resistance to macrolides, especially within a community, and crossresistance among macrolides has been observed.
