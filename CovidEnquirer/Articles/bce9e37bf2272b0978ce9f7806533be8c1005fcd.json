Such an analysis, embodied within the DS GeneAtlas1 1 pipeline, has been used to critically evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) genome with the goal of identifying new potential targets for viral therapeutic intervention. This paper discusses several new functional hypotheses on the roles played by the constituent gene products of SARS, and will serve as an example of how such assignments can be developed or extended on other systems of interest.",

This tenet is well supported by the current problems being presented by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on several continents [1, 2] , even more so as SARS is a viral infection whose genetic identity has only recently been reported [3, 4] . Inspection of the SARS genome using a battery of bioinformatic techniques suggests some of the gene products that might be targeted as a site of intervention, albeit the majority of the genome escapes functional assignment [3, 4] . The purpose of this note is to introduce the use of an automated structural proteomic pipeline to extend the assignment of putative function for the gene products of SARS, and in so doing o\u00a1er several new targets for further assessment. Key to this approach is the development of robust functional assignments achieved by relying on multiple methods of analysis that are highly integrated.",

When taken with the third long coding region for the S (Spike) protein, these three sequences are likely to be a fertile source or targets through which a therapeutic might be developed. While this study considered all of the open reading frames (orfs) within the genome, all hypotheses developed are isolated to these \u00a2rst three regions of the genome. Our strategy has been to employ the validated methods of protein function assignment embodied by the DS GeneAtlas1 pipeline, consisting of a cacophony of methods from both bioinformatic and structural biology \u00a2elds, all of which is described elsewhere [5] . Such an automated approach is only enabled through the comprehensive integration of the respective methods, leveraging the strengths and weaknesses of each to develop robust assignments.",

Analysis of the variation of the di\u00a1erent strains was performed to ensure that all non-synonymous polymorphisms were consistent with the assignments being proposed. Moreover, using predicted protein sequences from di\u00a1erent strains and protein products based on putative cleavage sites has shown that the functional assignments discussed herein are robust and invariant to the speci\u00a2c protein sequences used as input to the DS GeneAtlas pipeline. In many cases the assignments of all resulting protein sequences contained inferences to structural homologies, albeit via sequence homologies that are below 30%. The robustness of such assignments follows from cooperating evidence obtained from protein threading and more traditional bioinformatics techniques, but also is a\u00a1orded the automated and manual inspection of the structural alignment with respect to known active site residues, preservation of binding site residues, de\u00a2ned secondary structure, and conserved residues known to be involved in the function of the protein.",

            "text": "DS GeneAtlas is an automated high-throughput pipeline for the prediction of protein structure and function [5] . The pipeline consists of transmembrane domain prediction using TransMem [6] , domain prediction using HMMer and Pfam, sequence similarity search using PSI-BLAST, fold recognition using SeqFold [7] , and homology modeling using MODELER [8] . The con\u00a2dence of the annotations is often judged based on the consensus of several methods. For structural annotation, 'Consensus Score' is used to rank the con\u00a2dence of the annotation. 'Consensus Score' is de\u00a2ned as 'Model Score' plus the sum of the active site percentage identity minus a threshold factor of 0.2 where the sum is over all the reported active site records in template PDB \u00a2le. If there is no active site record in template, 'Consensus Score' is the same as 'Model Score'. The con\u00a2dence is high if 'Consensus Score' is greater than 1.0, the con\u00a2dence is medium if the 'Consensus Score' is between 0.0 and 1.0, and the con\u00a2dence is low if 'Consensus Score' is less than 0. con\u00a2dence is high; if e-value is between 0.1 and 1e35 and the bit score is better than the noise cuto\u00a1 [9] , the con\u00a2dence is medium; otherwise, the con\u00a2dence is low. Polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are cleaved by a 3CL main protease and the papain-like accessory proteinase. We used the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab as well as the cleaved products de\u00a2ned by the putative cleavage site as input to DS GeneAtlas. M pro cleavage sites were identi\u00a2ed using the [GAVSTP]XLQ[SAGN] motif, with cleavage occurring immediately after the Gln residue [10, 11] yielding 11 cleavage sites. The papain-like protease (PLP) cleavage sites were identi\u00a2ed only in the \u00a2rst (N-terminal) product of M pro cleavage (residues 13 240). Using the motif [RK]XXXG[GA], which is most consistent with all known data about PLP cleavage sites in coronaviruses [12, 13] , six cleavage sites were found.",

Model scores and con\u00a2dence are listed with other annotations in Table 2 . The 3D structure of M pro shares a common fold with the human rhinoviral protease, a 3C cysteine protease (3C pro ), except that M pro has an additional helical domain at the C-terminus. Although M pro and 3C pro have very low sequence similarity (less than 10% sequence identity), given the common fold, their ligand binding pockets are located at the same position in the cleft between the two L domains (Fig. 2) and may bind to a similar ligand. Several cysteine protease inhibitors are studied including the rhinoviral protease inhibitor developed by P\u00a2zer's La Jolla unit, Agouron, for treatment of common cold. The catalytic dyad (residue His41 and Cys144) is conserved among TGEV, SARS virus, and HCoV. After our calculation was completed, two new crystal structures of M pro , one from human coronavirus 229E (HCoV) and another one from TGEV were released [14] . The latter has the same sequence as the previously published TGEV structure, except with a bound ligand. The TGEV M pro structure of the apo protein and the ligand bound protein are similar with backbone rmsd less than 1.0 A \u00ee without major conformational changes around the ligand binding site. The percentage sequence identity between SARS M pro and TGEV M pro is 44% and is 41% between SARS and HCoV M pro . Therefore, the original template that we used is still one of the best templates for creating the homology model of SARS M pro . Subsequently, the crystal structure of the M pro of SARS genome was determined and deposited into the PDB databank (1q2w). The backbone rmsd between our predicted model and the X-ray structure is 2.45 A \u00ee over 295 residues. The structure is more conserved around the ligand binding site, the backbone atom rmsd is 1.32 A \u00ee over 220 residues.",

The polymerase and helicase domains are predicted by others based on sequence analysis methods [3, 4] , however, these are the \u00a2rst model structures created using homology modeling. Although the model scores are poor, the assignment is con\u00a2rmed by Pfam analysis used in GeneAtlas pipeline. It should be noted that the predicted structure of the large insertion region for about 40 residues (colored with yellow background in Fig. 3A and blue in Fig.  3B ) is tenuous. Homology models created automatically by the DS GeneAtlas pipeline are mainly used to con\u00a2rm the low scoring regions in matches found by PSI-BLAST or Seq-Fold searches and to reduce false positives inherent in these methods [5] . Model regions with high sequence identity to a template with small insertions are generally more reliable than model regions with large insertions. Model regions with conserved functional motifs such as active sites or ligand binding sites are in general more reliably assigned than assignments absent these features. This is demonstrated by the model of M pro where the ligand binding site has a low rmsd with the X-ray structure. These experiences support the conclusion that homology models created via an automated pipeline can provide useful insights on the fold of the protein, the mapped active sites and functional motifs from the template, and the location(s) of putative binding pockets. For subsequent structure-based studies such as ligand docking the models should be used with some caution as they often require further manual re\u00a2nement to improve the sequence alignment and to regenerate an improved model.",

The residues in the surface binding site are not conserved between template and model which suggests that the SARS virus replication is likely to be activated by other means or by a di\u00a1erent type of ligand. The structures are more conserved around the catalytic reaction center and there are no large gaps between model sequence and template sequence. On the other hand, several parts of the model structure on the surface are modeled with lower quality due to a few large insertions in the model sequence. Another model structure is created based on template 1c2p albeit more than 100 residues in the N-terminus are not modeled by this template.

Using directly the polyprotein or the cleaved products de\u00a2ned by the putative cleavage site as input to DS GeneAtlas pipeline resulted in overall similar levels of annotation, however, with slightly di\u00a1erent quality scores for the predicted models. An example of the robustness of assignment is given for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (see Table 2 ). The model predicted using the complete pp1ab sequence as input has a better overall quality compared to the model predicted using the cleaved sequence from residues 4231 to 5301 of pp1ab. The aspartic catalytic triad is conserved from template to model if the full pp1ab is the input sequence, whereas the triad is misaligned when the cleaved sequence is used. The alignment used to create the homology model is generated by PSI-BLAST which can yield slightly di\u00a1erent pro\u00a2les depending if a sequence is used as input or a domain of that sequence is used as input. The di\u00a1erence is only signi\u00a2cant when the homology between template and model is extremely low. In the case of the main protease model, the cleaved sequence and the complete sequence resulted in exactly the same model.",

They are close homologs to the SARS coronavirus M pro . The model structure of the M pro based on TGEV has good quality and can be used in the de novo inhibitor design. The RNA polymerase of SARS virus exhibits remote homology to HCV polymerase which is an important drug target for treating hepatitis C infection. Also predicted are several other novel structural or functional domains that are not currently known, such as the Fts-J-like methyltransferase and the fusion peptide. Each of these represents a new hypothesis for subsequent veri\u00a2cation and potential therapeutic intervention.",

This is consistent with our assignment of Fts-J-like methyltransferase to a domain in pp1b. Meta servers such as the 3D-Jury system [19] are based on the consensus score of many fold recognition programs and have been shown to be quite e\u00a1ective at the identi\u00a2cation of correct folds for unknown proteins. However, fold recognition programs are often time consuming and the meta servers are not typically designed for high-throughput (whole genome) analysis as described herein. Moreover, DS GeneAtlas annotates non-structural regions of the available sequence with transmembrane domain predictions, and structural annotations that are important for protein function are automatically identi\u00a2ed and mapped onto the model structures, for example, active site annotations from a template protein. While existing meta servers [19^21] focus on the use of structural modeling to annotate individual novel proteins, the present study combines protein modeling with mutation analysis and membrane spanning region prediction to provide a comprehensive functional view of the SARS genome in which assignments are correlated across a variety of analysis methods.",
