However, many previous studies have reported that the liquid impingers are surprisingly inefficient for the collection of ultrafine bioaerosols, with collection efficiencies o 30%. In the present work, we have successfully improved the collection efficiency of the liquid impinger (AGI30) to as high as 99% for particles in the size range of 20-400 nm with the aid of packed glass beads. We also systematically investigated the effects of influential factors on the collection efficiency. These factors include the volume of the sampling liquid (0, 20 and 30 mL), depth (0, 7 and 10 cm) of packed glass beads and sampling flow rate (4, 6 and 8 liter per min, lpm). According to our experimental results, increasing the depth of packed glass beads and the volume of sampling liquid can enhance the collection efficiency. Also, decreasing the sampling flow rate can increase the collection efficiency and reduce the loss of sampling liquid. For the sampling of viable MS2 phages, the collection efficiency of AGI30 sampler with packed glass beads is much higher than that without packed glass beads. Conclusively, this study validates that the granular bed filtration can enhance the collection efficiency of liquid impingers for submicron and ultrafine particles and viral aerosols.",

            "text": "The virus particles such as are submicron and ultrafine particles, and ultrafine bioaerosols can penetrate deeply into the pulmonary tract and may cause serious health effects (Graham, Donaldson, & Baric, 2013; Lin et al., 2004) . Lindsley et al. (2012) demonstrated that influenza patients generate smaller and more aerosol particles than healthy subjects (Yang, Lee, Chen, Wu, & Yu, 2007) . However, most previous studies regarding collection efficiency of liquid impingers for bioaerosols focus on the micrometer-sized bioaerosols (Tseng & Li, 2005) . Up to the present time, there are only a few studies on the collection efficiencies of liquid impingers for submicron viral aerosols, and ultrafine particles (Hogan et al., 2005; Miljevic, Modini, Bottle, & Ristovski, 2009; Spanne, Grzybowski, & Bohgard, 1999; Wei, Rosario, & Montoya, 2010) . Spanne et al. (1999) found that the collection efficiency of an AGI for particles with diameters between 0.02 and 0.7 mm was less than 20%. Wei et al. (2010) discovered that the midget impinger's collection efficiency for particles in the range of 30-100 nm was less than 20%. Hogan et al. (2005) also found that the collection efficiencies of the AGI30 sampler were surprisingly low (o10%) for sampling virus particles with sizes of 30-100 nm. The SKC BioSampler, which applies the combination of impaction and centrifugal motion for collecting airborne particles (more efficient for larger particles), has also been proven to be an inefficient sampler for particles smaller than 0.3 mm (Hogan et al., 2005; Willeke, Lin, & Grinshpun, 1998) . Therefore, to improve the collection efficiency of the liquid impingers for submicron viral aerosols, we can utilize the Brownian diffusional deposition of the ultrafine particles. Miljevic et al. (2009) studied the efficiency of an impinger with fritted nozzle tip for collecting ultrafine particles. They obtained a significantly high collection efficiency ($ 95%), primarily because of the diffusional deposition of particles in the fritted nozzle tip, particularly in the case of finer porosity frits. However, it is difficult to harvest the biological agents from the porous fritted nozzle tip. Numerous previous studies have reported the excellent removal efficiency of granular bed filtration for ultrafine particles (B\u00e9mer, Subra, Morele, Charvet, & Thomas, 2013) , and thus, this technique seems to be a practical scheme for improving the collection efficiency of liquid impinger for submicron and ultrafine bioaerosols. To increase the recovery of the collected biological agents from the granular bed, the packed material used should be spherical with a smooth surface. Thus, in this study, we intended to enhance the collection efficiency of the liquid-based impinger for ultrafine particles and viral aerosols with the aid of packed glass beads. We selected the AGI30 sampler to test our approach because the configuration of this sampler is suitable for packed glass beads. The influential factors on the collection efficiency, including the volume of the sampling liquid, the depth of packed glass beads, as well as the sampling flow rate, were systematically studied. We found that the application of packed glass beads significantly improved the collection efficiency of AGI30 sampler for ultrafine particles and viral aerosols. Thus, our proposal that the granular bed filtration can enhance the collection efficiency of liquid impingers for ultrafine particles and bioaerosols was proven to be valid.",

A Collison-type constant output atomizer (Model 3076, TSI Inc., USA) was employed to generate droplets from the solution or suspension containing the test materials. In the Set 1 experiment, LB liquid medium (LB Broth, Difco TM ) was utilized to produce the test aerosol particles because the LB medium was employed to culture the test bioaerosols (MS2 phages). These droplets transformed to neutralized submicron particles after passing through the homemade diffusion dryer and then a Kr-85 radioactive Aerosol Neutralizer (Model 3077, TSI Inc., USA). The homemade diffusion dryer was used to dry and remove water from aerosol produced by the atomizer. In the dryer, the aerosol flows through a channel (60 cm long and 1 cm in diameter) surrounded by silica gel desiccant to remove extra wetness by diffusional capture.",

Both Golshahi, Abedi, and Tan (2009) and Ozis, Singh, Devinny, and Sioutas (2004) demonstrated that particle collection efficiency increased with the depth of dry granular filter media. As anticipated, it took more time for the air to pass through a thicker granular bed. Thus, there was a longer contact time for more particles to be collected by either diffusion or sedimentation or impaction. Usually, increasing the depth of packed glass beads may enhance the collection efficiency of the AGI30 samplers. However, the density and viscosity of water are much higher than the air, and thus, the behavior of the liquid impinger packed with a granular bed is a little different from that of the dry granular filter media. When the depth of packed glass beads (h) in the sampler is lower than the level of sampling liquid (L), the granular bed may become unstable during sampling owing to the turbulent fluid movement. Under this condition, the granular bed could not function well, and the capture efficiency of granular bed for particles would decrease, as the case of the settings of 7h 30V s 4Q s and 7h 30V s 6Q s shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) . However, increasing the depth of packed glass beads could help stabilize the granular bed and thus enhance the capture efficiency for particles. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) , the results of pair settings of 7h 30V s 4Q s vs. 10h 30V s 4Q s and 7h 30V s 6Q s vs. 10h 30V s 6Q s is a good example to demonstrate this effect. Fig. 4 .

Effect of sampling flow rate on the collection efficiency of AGI30 sampler Fig. 4 demonstrates the effect of sampling flow rate on the collection efficiency of AGI30 sampler for the LB media particles. The AGI30 sampler had the highest collection efficiency when being operated at the lowest sampling flow rate of 4 lpm. When the sampling flow rate increased to 6 and 8 lpm, the collection efficiency reduced about 20%. These two collection efficiency curves for AGI30 at sampling flow rates of 6 lpm and 8 lpm crossed over at particle diameter of 40 nm. For capturing particles smaller than 40 nm, the 6-lpm sampling flow rate was better than 8-lpm. In contrast, the 8-lpm sampling flow rate was better than 6-lpm for collecting particles larger than 40 nm. This result was reasonable because small particles were captured mainly by the Brownian motion, which was presumably the primary collection mechanism at lower flow rates. Conversely, the larger particles were mainly collected by inertial impaction, which worked better at higher flow rates. A similar result has been reported by Hogan et al. (2005) in which MS2 and T3 phages were used as the test aerosol particles.",

When the sampling flow rate reduced to 4 and 6 lpm, the collection efficiencies of AGI30 with packed glass bead achieved as high as 0.99 for particles of 20-450 nm. Presumably, the packed glass beads enhanced the collecting of particle by either the Brownian diffusion or inertial impaction or both of them. Ozis et al.

However, the best sampler should be the one that gives the highest collection efficiency with the least pressure drop. A useful criterion for comparing different samplers is the \"sampler quality\" (Eq. (2)), which is initially used for assessing the filter media performance. Because increasing sampling flow rate would increase the pressure drop of the sampler, the comparison of sampler quality has to be conducted under the same sampling flow rate. Fig. 5 (and Fig. S2) shows the sampler quality of the AGI30 samplers under different settings. The sampler setting with the highest sampler quality at the sampling flow rate of 4 and 6 lpm were \"10h 30V s 4Q s \" and \"10h 30V s 6Q s \", respectively. The superior collection efficiency of these two settings leaded to this result, although the highest depth of packed glass beads (10 cm) created a considerable pressure drop. However, because higher sampling flow rate would result in more loss of sampling liquid (2-mL loss at 6 lpm vs. 1-mL loss at 4 lpm), the setting of \"10h 30V s 4Q s \" might be better than \"10h 30V s 6Q s .\" Thus, the best performing condition for the sampler is the setting of \"10h 30V s 4Q s .\"",

Moreover, we systematically investigated the effects of sampling flow rate, depth of packed glass beads as well as the volume of the sampling liquid on the collection efficiency. Increasing the sampling flow rate would reduce the collection efficiency of the sampler. On the other hand, increasing the depth of packed glass beads or volume of sampling liquid would enhance the collection efficiency. For the collecting of viable MS2 phages, the AGI30 sampler with packed glass beads performed much better than that one without packed glass beads. Conclusively, applying the AGI30 sampler with packed glass beads under an optimum setting can collect the ultrafine particles and viral aerosols with excellent efficiently.",
