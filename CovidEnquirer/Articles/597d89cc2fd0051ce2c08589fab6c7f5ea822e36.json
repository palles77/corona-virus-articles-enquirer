            "text": "The coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein is a major structural component of virions that associates with the genomic RNA to form a helical nucleocapsid. N appears to be a multifunctional protein since data also suggest that the protein may be involved in viral RNA replication and translation. All of these functions presumably involve interactions between N and viral RNAs. As a step toward understanding how N interacts with viral RNAs, we mapped high-efficiency N-binding sites within BCV-and MHV-defective genomes. Both in vivo and in vitro assays were used to study binding of BCV and MHV N proteins to viral and nonviral RNAs. N-viral RNA complexes were detected in bovine coronavirus (BCV)-infected cells and in cells transiently expressing the N protein. Filter binding was used to map N-binding sites within Drep, a BCV-defective genome that is replicated and packaged in the presence of helper virus. One high-efficiency N-binding site was identified between nucleotides 1441 and 1875 at the 3\u0408 end of the N ORF within Drep. For comparative purposes N-binding sites were also mapped for the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV)-defective interfering (DI) RNA MIDI-C. Binding efficiencies similar to those for Drep were measured for RNA transcripts of a region encompassing the MHV packaging signal (nts 3949-4524), as well as a region at the 3\u0408 end of the MHV N ORF (nts 4837-5197) within MIDI-C. Binding to the full-length MIDI-C transcript (\u03f35500 nts) and to an \u03f31-kb transcript from the gene 1a region (nts 935-1986) of MIDI-C that excluded the packaging signal were both significantly higher than that measured for the smaller transcripts. This is the first identification of N-binding sequences for BCV. It is also the first report to demonstrate that N interacts in vitro with sequences other than the packaging signal and leader within the MHV genome. The data clearly demonstrate that N binds coronavirus RNAs more efficiently than nonviral RNAs. The results have implications with regard to the multifunctional role of N.",

Multiple assays were used to gain insight into N-RNA interactions that may be involved in coronavirus RNA packaging, nucleocapsid assembly, and other postulated functions of N. Quantitative analysis of N-RNA interactions revealed that N interacts more efficiently with coronavirus RNA than with noncoronavirus RNA. High-efficiency binding regions were mapped for the BCV-defective genome RNA Drep and defective interfering (DI) MHV RNA MIDI-C (de Groot et al., 1992; Chang et al., 1994) (Fig. 1 ). Both defective genomes are replicated and packaged by their parental virus. BCV and MHV belong to the same antigenic subgroup. Sequence comparisons indicate that the two viruses are closely related (Lapps et al., 1987; Abraham et al., 1990a,b; Kienzle et al., 1990) . Even though the two viruses share many similarities, they appear to differ with regard to RNA packaging. BCV packages subgenomic RNA in addition to genomic RNA (Hofmann et al., 1990) , whereas MHV packages very little, if any, of its subgenomics. BCV Drep is replicated and packaged by BCV, but it does not contain any gene 1b sequence ( Fig. 1) (Chang et al., 1994; Cologna and Hogue, 2000) . MIDI-C contains part of gene 1b where a packaging signal maps (van der Most et al., 1991; Fosmire et al., 1992) (Fig. 1) . We recently identified a packaging signal in the BCV genome that is homologous to the MHV packaging signal (Cologna and Hogue, 2000) . Our analyses of N-binding sites within the BCV and MHV defective genomes provide the most comprehensive and comparative study to date of coronavirus N-RNA interactions.",

Mock-and BCV-infected HCT cells were metabolically labeled with [ 32 P]orthophosphate in the absence of actinomycin D. Both viral and cellular RNAs are labeled in the absence of the inhibitor, whereas only viral RNAs are labeled in the presence of the inhibitor. Cytoplasmic RNAs were either examined directly or after immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for the N protein. Antibodies against the spike protein (S) or preimmune sera were used as controls. As expected, in the absence of actinomycin D a large amount of label was incorporated into ribosomal RNAs ( Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2) . Weaker viral RNA signals were observed over the background when total RNA from infected cells was analyzed directly (Fig. 2A, lane 2) . Genomic and subgenomic RNAs were clearly visible from BCV-infected cells labeled in the presence of actinomycin D, whereas no RNAs were seen with mock-infected cells ( Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4) . A profile typical of virus genomic and subgenomic RNAs was observed for RNAs coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies against N ( Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6) . Immunoprecipitation with the BCV S-specific antibodies demonstrated that the N-RNA complexes were specific for the N protein and that we were not merely recovering translation complexes. In all experiments, specific immunoprecipitation of the N and S proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting analysis (data not shown).",

Both intracellular RNAs (lanes 1-10) and extracellular virion were analyzed by Northern blotting with a CATspecific probe.

RNAs in addition to genomic RNA (Hofmann et al., 1990; Chang et al., 1994; Cologna and Hogue, 2000) . We mapped one high-efficiency N-binding region in the 3\u0408 half of the N ORF within Drep RNA. However, a nonviral RNA that contained the N-binding region was not packaged, suggesting that interactions between N and this region of the RNA do not explain why Drep or subgenomics are packaged by BCV. Even though the high-efficiency binding region does not appear to be directly relevant for packaging, interactions between N and this region of the genome may play a role indirectly in the assembly of the helical nucleocapsid. Interestingly we also mapped a high-efficiency N-binding site within the 3\u0408 half of the MHV N ORF. N presumably binds multiple regions throughout the genomic RNA. High-efficiency N-binding sites, other than the packaging signal, may contribute to the efficiency of packaging, while not being a functional packaging signal.",

We cannot rule out the possibility that, if Drep contains a packaging signal, the folding of the chimeric RNA masked it. It is also possible that the defective genome must be replicated subsequent to or concurrent with packaging. Preliminary data in our lab support the idea that replication and packaging may be coupled, and experiments are ongoing to address this. Different maximum N-binding efficiencies were measured for Drep and MIDI-C, defective genomes for BCV and MHV, respectively. We were able to calculate only rough estimates for K d s since our his-tagged N protein preparations were not absolutely pure. Analysis of our data for N-binding to MIDI-C and Drep RNAs yielded K d s of \u03f321 and \u03f389 nM, respectively. The K d for N binding to noncoronavirus transcripts was \u03f31 mM. The differences in binding activity for MIDI-C and Drep may have important implications for the comparative efficiency with which the two defective genomes are encapsidated and packaged.",

Intuitively one might expect a packaging signal to exhibit the highest N-binding when compared to other parts of the genome. However, this is not the case for MIDI-C, at least under the in vitro conditions used in our study. N bound as efficiently to MIDI-C RNA when the packaging signal was deleted as it did to MIDI-C that contained the packaging signal. Molenkamp and Spaan (1997) initially showed that N binds the MHV packaging signal, but binding affinities were not measured and N-binding sites were not mapped for other regions of MIDI-C. We measured a K d of \u03f3100 nM for N-binding to an \u03f3600-nt transcript that included the MHV packaging signal. At this time it is not clear what distinguishes other N-binding sites within the genome from N-binding to the packaging signal. Under the in vitro assay conditions used here it appears that binding efficiency might not be the determining factor. However, the context within which the signal is presented within the genome may alter the interactions, even though the packaging signal alone is sufficient to direct an RNA to be packaged in either MHV-or BCVinfected cells (Bos et al., 1997; Woo et al., 1997; Cologna and Hogue, 2000) .",

Bos and colleagues (1997) inserted an intergenic sequence into MHV MIDI-C to direct the synthesis of a subgenomic RNA containing the MHV packaging signal; the subgenomic was packaged less efficiently than the parental MIDI genomic RNA. This suggests that other factors may be involved in determining the efficiency of packaging. These elements could be a specific sequence(s) or structure(s) that functions as a packaging enhancer by binding N and allowing the RNA to be more efficiently encapsidated and packaged into mature virions. The element(s) within gene 1a that we identified are possibly important in this regard. We are currently testing this possibility. Sequences that enhance packaging have been identified for other viruses. For example, naturally occurring Sindbis virus DI RNAs contain a sequence at the 5\u0408 end that enhances packaging (Frolova et al., 1997) .",

Binding affinity for segment 8 viral RNA (vRNA), conserved 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 ends of the vRNAs, and degenerate sequences were all bound at similar affinities with K d s that ranged from 20 to 38 nm. The affinity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) N protein for leader RNA that contains the VSV encapsidation signal is \u03f310 times higher than that for nonspecific sequences (Blumberg et al., 1983) . The results presented here indicate that coronavirus N, like influenza virus NP, does not exhibit absolute specificity for only coronavirus RNAs. However, the protein does appear to preferentially bind coronavirus RNAs. Furthermore, N binds certain regions of the viral RNAs better than others. Binding specificity for encapsidation and packaging in the context of virus-infected cells may be influenced by interactions with the membrane (M) protein or possibly other viral proteins. Compartmentalization of replication complexes in membranous structures may also provide an environment that eliminates the necessity for absolute N-binding specificity.",
