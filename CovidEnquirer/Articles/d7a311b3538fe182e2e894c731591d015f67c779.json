The vein may not be visualized in some species but runs from the manubrium to just below the angle of the jaw in all species.

The patient is anesthetized and restrained in dorsal recumbency with the tail exposed. Dilate the vessels by immersion of the tail in water not exceeding 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C). The lateral veins lie immediately beneath the skin on each side of the tail. The central artery is midline on the ventral surface of the tail. The author prefers to use the artery for removal of blood and the veins for injection. With the tail under gentle traction and the needle at a 45\u00b0angle to the tail, insert needle into the lumen of the vessel with the bevel facing cranial. Blood is withdrawn slowly. When taking blood from the artery, a 25-gauge needle on a 1-mL syringe barrel (no plunger) may be used and the blood is allowed to flow under its own pressure. Flicking or gentle massaging of the tail toward the needle may help facilitate bleeding. Remove the needle and apply gentle pressure to the site of entry to ensure good hemostasis. PCV and hemoglobin measurements have been reported to be higher in blood collected from the tail vein compared with blood obtained from other sites. 3 Blood may be collected by \"tipping\" the tail of mice, although it is not a preferred method and should be reserved as an alternative when other approaches fail. The mouse is anesthetized and warmed. Do not attempt to increase blood flow by rubbing the tail from the base to the tip, because this will result in leukocytosis (increased white blood cell [WBC] count). Using a scalpel or straight-edge razor, quickly remove 2 to 3 mm of the tail. Collect blood in a capillary tube as drops appear. Apply pressure or use tissue glue to stop the bleeding. When several samples are needed within a short time period, the original wound can be reopened by removing the clot. When additional samples are needed at a later date, blood samples can be obtained by removing just 2 to 3 mm of additional tail. Cutting the tail too short may result in trauma to the cartilage and ultimately the coccygeal vertebrae.",

Epinephrine causes neutrophils or heterophils to leave the marginating pool as a response to increased heart rate and blood flow, resulting in a neutrophilia or heterophilia. Exogenous and endogenous corticosteroids associated with physiological stress that accompanies systemic disease or is from an exogenous source will cause a lymphopenia and occasionally a mature neutrophilia/heterophilia.",

This may be truer for the rodent patient than any other treated by the veterinarian. Glucose values are affected by the nutritional, hormonal, and emotional state of the animal. Hyperglycemia has been reported in hamsters during hibernation. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are highly variable in rodents, affected mostly by diet. Laboratory rodent diet protein levels may vary from 12% to 24%, resulting in significant changes in BUN in healthy animals. BUN values vary widely in hamsters with nephritis, and creatinine is a more reliable indicator of renal function. Creatinine values are affected by many drugs and compounds that rodents may be exposed to, including barbiturates, glucose, protein, acetone, ketones, ascorbic acid, and sulfobromophthalein. 10 Unlike the rabbit, bilirubin is the end product of hemoglobin metabolism in rodents. Measurement of total bilirubin includes both conjugated and unconjugated (free) forms and is a useful screening test for liver damage or hemolysis in rodents. The AP present in the serum of a healthy hamster is composed mostly of the isoenzyme from bone and intestine. Elevated levels of AP may be found in the hamster with liver disease, but dramatic increases are usually associated with bile duct obstructions. High levels are also associated with leukemia and tumors of the prostate gland. 10 Urinalysis Urinalysis (UA) is a simple and quick procedure that can yield valuable information regarding the function of the urinary system as well as other organs and systems in the body. In the author's practice, it is part of the basic information collected on many rodents presented with clinical disease signs. Guinea pigs are particularly susceptible to urinary tract infections and rarely are presented with diabetes mellitus (DM). UA is performed in the rodent similar to techniques used for other mammals. Urine may be collected by free catch, manual expression, or cystocentesis. Catheterization is easily performed in larger rodent species (e.g., guinea pigs, chinchilla, prairie dogs, Degus) but is very difficult in others (e.g., mice, hamsters). When obtaining a sample by free catch, an effort should be made to avoid the first part of the urine stream because it will contain exudate flushed from the urethra. Overzealous manual expression may result in artifactual blood in the urine sample. Anesthesia may be required for cystocentesis or catheterization in most patients. Urine collected for bacterial cultures should be obtained by catheterization or cystocentesis. The UA is best analyzed as soon as the urine is collected. Urine preserved by refrigeration is suitable for examination for 2 to 3 hours.",

Rodents with low urinespecific gravity tend to have clearer urine containing less sediment. Cloudy urine must always be interpreted based on microscopic evaluation.

A new method for screening very small rodent samples for many tests used by RADIL is multiplex fluorescent immunoassay (MFI). MFI requires only 0.2 L of undiluted serum regardless of the number of tests requested (recommended submitted sample volume to allow for potential confirmatory testing and ease of handling is 100 L of 1:5 diluted or 20 L of undiluted serum). The technology is based both on beadbased immunoassay and flow cytometry. Each purified RADIL antigen or control preparation is covalently linked to 1 of 100 different types of polystyrene beads, which vary slightly in the intensity of their color. If immunoglobulin G antibody to a particular antigen is present, it will bind to the antigen on a specific bead and will then be detected by subsequent binding of goat antimouse antibody conjugated to a fluorochrome, R-phycoerythrin. The reader channels single beads through a dual-laser detector, which simultaneously determines both the bead type by the internal dye combination and the fluorescent intensity associated with each individual bead. The fluorescent intensity associated with each of 100 individual beads of each type is used in the determination of each MFI value. The overall correlation between MFI and ELISA is greater than 99.5% for both mouse and rat samples. In general, MFI is more sensitive than ELISA and is less prone to false-positive results.",
