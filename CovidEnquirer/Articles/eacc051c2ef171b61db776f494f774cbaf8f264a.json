AM represent a highly permissive cell for infection yielding progeny virus titers of greater than IO' TCID,,/ml. AM serve as sensitive cells for isolation of virus from diagnostic samples and antibody detection using indirect FA or IPT methods. AM are primary targets for virus replication in the infected animal, yet PRRSV is a multisystem disease characterized by profound viremia and virus distribution and replication in multiple organs causing interstitial pneumonia, vasculitis. lymphadenopathy, myocarditis and encephalitis (Rossow et al., 1995) . Thus, replication solely in AM does not fully explain the pathogenesis of PRRSV in the infected animal. Furthermore, in vitro studies with AM and collections from PRRSV-infected animals reveal that not all AM become infected. Also. in vitro studies with AM show that not 100% of cells are affected and that there is great variability in susceptibility of AM from various donor pigs. In an attempt to elucidate the susceptibility of various cell types and variability within cell types, we examined the susceptibility of various macrophage populations (i.e. microglia, monocytes) and the heterogeneity of alveolar macrophages to infection by PRRSV. To examine the heterogeneity of AM. a procedure was devised to separate AM into subpopulations by subjecting AM lavaged from lungs to a discontinued gradient centrifugation and each fraction was evaluated for morphology, expression of cell surface markers. macrophage functions and susceptibility to infection by PRRSV. All fractions consisted of greater than 95% macrophages using a panel of monoclonal antibodies against porcine macrophages. The largest cells were found in the lowest density fraction (I) and the smallest cells were in the highest density fraction (VI, showing an inverse relationship between cell size and density. Fractions in the lower densities (I and II> appeared to have more cytoplasmic vacuoles and lower nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios relative to fractions III, IV and V and appear to represent mature, differentiated macrophages. Functional differences existed between the fractions of PAM. PAM from the higher density fractions (III. IV and V) showed increased phagocytosis of Pasteurella multocida, superoxide anion production and TNF-a production relative to PAM from lower density fractions (I and II). In contrast, binding of opsonized sheep red blood cells through Fc receptors was greatest in the lowest density cells (I). Increased PRRS virus replication was observed in PAM from the higher density fractions (III, IV and V> representing more immature cells (Choi et al., 1995) . Further studies examined the susceptibility of populations of macrophages including brain microglia and peripheral blood monocytes. Swine microglia were highly permissive to infection with PRRSV yielding progeny titers of greater than 10' TCIDJml.",

Yet when monocytes were induced to mature through treatment with M-CSF or activated via the adherence to porcine endothelial cells, monocytes became permissive to PRRSV infection. Voicu et al. (1994) demonstrated that peripheral blood monocytes collected via adherence to plastic were permissive to PRRSV infection yielding virus titers of 10' TCID,/ml, a 1 ,OOO-fold reduction compared to AM yet nonetheless significant titers. Although there is an apparent paradox in the two findings, it appears that maturation and activation of monocytes is necessary for productive infection. The adherence to plastic could in fact activate the cells. Collectively, these results indicate that heterogenous PAM populations exist and that these cells showed different morphological and functional properties. Furthermore, the activation/maturation stage of macrophages modulate the susceptibility to virus infection. The susceptiblity of various immune cells to PRRSV is summarized in Table  1 .",

W. Molitor PT al. / Veterinu? Microbiology 55 ClYY7) [265] [266] [267] [268] [269] [270] [271] [272] [273] [274] [275] [276] 1995) and (2) experimental infection with PRRSV precipitates clinical disease in piglets challenged with Streprococcus suis (Calina et al., 1994) or with either of two respiratory viruses, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or swine influenza (SI, Van Reeth et al., 1994) . PRRSV infections are commonly followed by severe, secondary bacterial diseases which greatly reduce the performance of growing pigs (Collins and Rossow, 1993) . In a few selected herds. a thorough pathological and microbiological work-up has been performed. A variety of infectious agents have been isolated in concert with PRRSV: Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia, Myoplasma hyymeumoniae, Haemoplilus parasuis, Actinomyes pygenes. Streptococcus suis and swine influenza (Zeman et al., 1993) . The conclusion from this field investigation was that PRRSV can increase the incidence of other common diseases. One of the agents identified, H. parasuis, has been diagnosed increasingly in the upper midwest. since the appearance of PRRSV. Iowa State Diagnostic Laboratory identified 142 isolations in 1992. compared to 79 in 1990. South Dakota State Laboratory identified 144 cases in 1992. compared to 54 in 1990. Minnesota State Laboratory identified 3 I8 in 1992, compared to 35 in 1988. Indirect evidence of the role of PRRSV in precipitating secondary infections comes from successfully improved growth and decreased mortality on farms that have eliminated PRRSV through nursery depopulation (Dee and Joo, 1994) . With the elimination of PRRSV on farms, production improved and the isolation and association of disease with secondary agents dramatically decreased. Clinically, there is little doubt that concurrent PRRSV frequently results in devastating secondary infectious diseases in pigs; however, although clinical and diagnostic laboratory data support the hypothesis of an interaction between PRRSV and other agents, yet attempts to demonstrate PRRSV as a predisposing factor in respiratory disease under experimental conditions. with the exceptions of Streptococcus suis and two viruses, porcine respiratory coronavirus and swine influenza, have been unsuccessful.",

However, it has been difficult to study clinical disease caused by S. suis infection because clinical disease is difficult to reproduce using natural routes of exposure when challenging with S. suis alone. The objectives of experimental studies performed by Galina et al.

Pigs inoculated with PRRSV (VR-2332) followed by challenge with a virulent strain (87555) of S. suis serotype 2 developed clinical signs, suppurative meningitis and abundant growth of S. suis from tissues, including brain-meninges.",

In the study of , cell distribution in the lung of infected animals changed dramatically by day 7 post-infection, evidenced by a marked decrease in the percentage of alveolar macrophages and an increase in the percentage of lymphocytes and neutrophils. Associated with the altered lung cell dynamics was a decrease in the functional ability of alveolar macrophages to release superoxide anion. In sharp contrast was the finding of profound enhancement of humoral and cell-mediated function in the systemic circulation of PRRSV infected swine. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) and Brucella abortus antibody titers and delayed type hypersensitivity responses to the antigen DNFB were significantly enhanced in infected pigs of all age groups. A separate study by Albina et al. (1995) demonstrated that PRRSV did not impair the immune response following PRV vaccination. On the contrary, immune response and disease resistance of pigs previously infected with PRRSV and then challenged with virulent PRV were increased. In addition, immune parameters such as killer-cell activity and lymphocyte response to antigenic stimulation were not affected following PRRSV infection, leaving to question the role of PRRSV in causing systemic immunosuppression.",

It is postulated that the mechanisms of enhancement of replication is through Fc receptors. Protection from re-infection has been documented in field conditions and experimentally described in pregnant sows . Sows that were infected with the prototype USA isolate of PRRSV, VR-2332 and that recovered from infection were protected from manifestations of clinical signs and showed no viremia upon re-infection with the homologous strain. This protection could be transferred through colostrum to susceptible newborn pigs . To determine whether this protection was provided by antibodies an experiment was performed by passively transferring high titered anti-PRRSV antibodies to l-week-old pigs from non-immune dams and challenging the pigs with PRRS virus 24 h later. Pigs from immune dams were protected from experimental challenge, but pigs that received anti-PRRSV sera failed to be protected from challenge as were pigs receiving non-immune sera or PBS as controls. These results document that immunity can be transferred via colostrum, but antibodies by themselves fail to totally protect, thereby suggesting a role of cellular immunity in protection from disease.",

In an attempt to determine whether PRRSV induced a cell-mediated immune response, studies were undertaken to establish methods for detecting antigen-specific cell-mediated immune responses to PRRS virus. The purpose was to develop methods to detect CM1 responses to PRRSV, both ex-vivo, in the form of T-cell proliferation, and in vivo as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. To demonstrate proliferation responses, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PRRSV-infected and control pigs were stimulated in vitro with virus antigens for various incubation periods and T-cell proliferation determined by the uptake of 3H-thymidine.",
