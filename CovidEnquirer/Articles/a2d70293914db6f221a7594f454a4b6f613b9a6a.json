For this experiment, the cells were labeled for 7 to 8 hpi, and thus the 36K (JHMV), 37K (A59V), and 39K (A59V and JHMV) proteins are not present. At earlier times (5-6 hpi) these proteins are markedly enriched by the antisera. Other proteins, presumably cellular, are precipitated by the antisera in both mock and infected lysates. Three other proteins in the range of 15K and 30K are sometimes found in the radioimmune precipitates of both A59V and JHMV lysates, but not in the mocks (Fig. 4) . Since these proteins are not consistently evident in all experiments, we do not consider them to be viral specific.",

Four polypeptides are present in A59 virions. These proteins have apparent molecular weights of 150,000, 89,000, 60,000, and 20,000. We have also identified four proteins in JHM virions which differ slightly in molecular weight from the corresponding A59 virion proteins. We also find in JHM virions several polypeptides which are present in small and inconstant amounts. These are probably contaminating host-cell proteins. The electrophoretic mobilities of three of the virion proteins (the 150K, 89K, and 20K A59 proteins and the 150K, lOOK, and 18K JHM proteins) are slightly greater with virus FIG. 5.

The protein labeled E, detected only on IEF gels because of its pI of 4.1, has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 84,000. This molecular weight corresponds to the molecular weight of a virion structural protein. This protein is also occasionally detected in radioimmune precipitates of JHMV-infected cultures. The protein labeled B has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 75,000 and was only detected on gels using NEPHGE in the tist dimension for presently unknown reasons. Protein D has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 30,000. This protein was not consistently detected and is probably not a JHM-virus specific protein. The four spots labeled A, seen in the gel using NEPHGE in the first dimension, have molecular weights of about 24,000-29,000. Most of the spots in this complex did not appear in every experiment. The spot in the lower left-hand side of the A complex was present in multiple experiments and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 24,000. This spot may correspond to the spot labeled C in the gel using IEF in the first dimension which has an apparent molecular weight of about 20,000. Similar experiments were performed with A59V. The two-dimensional gels obtained from A59V-infected cultures are shown in Fig. 8 . The 150K, 60K, 57K, and 54K proteins are identified by their molecular weights as described for JHMVspecific proteins. The two spots present in the ellipse marked 39 and 37 present a problem. The position of the lower spot corresponds to a molecular weight of 34,000 while the position of the upper spot corresponds to a molecular weight of 37,000. We feel that the upper spot is the 37K A59V-specific protein identified in onedimensional SDS-gels. We feel that the lower spot is the 39K A59V-specific protein which migrates anomalously in two-dimensional NEPHGE gels. This type of anomalous migration has been reported for certain proteins . The protein labeled Z, only detected on gels using IEF in the first dimension, has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 89,000. This protein, analogous to the JHMV protein labeled E, probably represents the A59V structural protein of 90,000 molecular weight (Sturman, 1977) . The protein labeled X has an apparent molecular weight of 70,000 and corresponds to the JHMVspecific protein labeled B.

This protein is present in purified virus and probably corresponds to the glycoprotein of molecular weight 23,000 present in A59 virions described by Sturman (1977) . The failure of this intracellular protein to label with sugars suggests that this protein may also be glycosylated during virion assembly. In addition, we occasionally see several proteins with molecular weights between 25,000 and 30,000 on twodimensional gels of JHMV-infected cell lysates which are not present in mock-infected lysates or A59-infected cell lysates. We have not designated these as virusspecific proteins because of their inconsistent appearance. The presence of these proteins during JHMV infection may be dependent on the physiologic state of the cells at the time of infection or other presently undefined variables.",
