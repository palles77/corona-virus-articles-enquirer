            "text": "Health care-associated infections are serious public health issues because they contribute to patients' mortality and morbidity, 1 increase patient hospital stays, and present a significant health hazard for health care workers and patient family members. 2 Infection rates in low-and middle-income countries may exceed 25% 3 and place a significant economic burden on an already taxed health care system. 4, 5 Standard precautions (SPs) are considered fundamental protective measures to manage health care-associated infections and to reduce occupational health hazards. 6 SPs are motivated by the principal that all patients are potentially infectious, and therefore precautions should be used to manage risk. SPs guidelines suggest hand hygiene procedures; the use of protective barriers, such as gloves, masks, and goggles; appropriate handling and disposal of sharps and other contaminated or infectious waste; and use of aseptic techniques. 6 Studies suggest that use of SPs in low-and middle-income countries is low. 7 Nurses' adherence with SPs has an effect on reducing health careassociated infections, cross-infections between nurses and patients, and among patients, which in turn maximizes efficiency of health care resources. 8, 9 Nurses are frontline health care workers and therefore have the most direct contact with patients. 10 Globally, the level of SPs compliance, knowledge, and attitudes among health care workers is low. [11] [12] [13] Previous research indicated that the compliance rates of SPs among nurses ranged from 9.1%-73%, 14, 15 indicating a pressing need for improvement. The compliance rate was 69.4% among 560 nurses in Brazil and 57.4% among 260 nurses in Hong Kong. 16 Inadequate adherence to SPs includes failure to follow hand hygiene guidelines, failure to use barrier devices during exposures to body fluids, and performing needle recapping. 6 Lack of knowledge of SPs is directly related to nurses' noncompliance. 17 Ideally, SPs training should be completed early in nurses' training as part of a formal education curriculum. The majority of nursing students do not receive comprehensive SPs and occupational exposure education in China. One survey of 1,444 nursing students indicated that 722 students (50%) did not receive any SPs education. 12 A survey of 246 nursing students reported 1,144 needlestick injuries during internship, which revealed universal exposure in this study to bloodborne pathogens and possible infection. 18 Educational programs are needed to improve SPs compliance, knowledge, and attitudes among nursing professionals. Studies also suggest that compliance of nursing students with SPs significantly improves after education interventions. 19, 20 However, few SPs education intervention studies with nursing students are conducted in mainland China. The current study assessed the effectiveness of a mixed media education intervention for nursing students to enhance their knowledge, attitude, and compliance with SPs.",

The teaching hospital we chose is affiliated with among the best universities in China. It is a Grade-III Class-A facility (the largest and most comprehensive research and teaching hospitals according to the Chinese Hospital Ranking System) with a 3,300-bed hospital. Eligible participants were nursing students at the beginning of clinical training. Half of the sample (n = 42) was randomly assigned to the intervention group and another half to the control group. Previous studies of the effectiveness of mixed education programs for nursing students used a target effect size of 0.35. 22,23 G*Power 3 (http://www.gpower.hhu.de/en.html) was used to calculate the sample size. 24 At a statistical power of 0.80, a sample size of 70 was necessary to assess pre-post mean group differences with effect size of 0.35 and a significance level of 0.05. 25 Considering a 20% dropout rate, 26 a total of 84 participants was needed, with 42 in each group.

During the second session (2 hours), the researcher (PX) showed videos to demonstrate correct SPs procedures, such as how to properly wash hands, wear sterile gloves, and wear isolation gowns and personal protective equipment. The third session (2 hours) consisted of small group (6-7 participants per group) discussions focusing on the principles of SPs and their application in clinical practice. Role-playing exercises were facilitated during this session. The nursing students played the roles of teachers and students in small groups to assess and demonstrate correct SPs procedures with each other. The SPs procedures script, which included handwashing, wearing sterile gloves, wearing isolation gowns, and wearing personal protective equipment, was prepared by researchers and hospital infection management office staff members. The nursing students in the intervention group attended these 3 sessions at the same time.",

The following question was asked by the researcher of each nursing student: \"How do you feel about implementing SPs during these 2 weeks?\" \"Did you review the materials I uploaded?\" \"Do you have difficulties understanding these procedures?\" \"Did you perform your nursing procedures using standard precautions?\" and, \"Do you think it's useful for you? If so, please continue. If not, could you share your thoughts with me?\"",

Low scores were observed for items that measured barriers to implementing SPs. The reason for this may be that the baseline assessment occurred at the beginning of students' clinical rotations. They may not have had enough clinical experience and a lack of exposure to observe and learn in the isolation, infectious diseases, or surgical departments. Therefore, they did not recognize the importance of SPs. On the other hand, nursing students may not be able to obtain a patients' complete medical history, including the history of HIV, hepatitis B virus, or other infectious diseases. In previous studies nursing students did not pay enough attention to SPs due in part to the fact that some patients and their family members did not review or did not know their infectious status. 43 Compliance with SPs should be practiced at all times during clinical practice.",

First, the sample size was small. Although this is appropriate for a pilot test of a new intervention, future studies should include a larger sample size. Relatedly, the study was conducted in 1 hospital. A multicenter study would be ideal to confirm that the comprehensive nursing intervention model is effective and scalable.

Increased use of SPs is of vital importance to protect the health of nurses, patients, and other health care professionals from health care-associated infections. Improvement of SPs deficiencies is desperately needed because emergent cases of H7N9, Ebola virus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus will expose Chinese nurses to infectious disease. There is an urgent need from policy makers, nursing school teachers, and hospital trainers to reduce SPs deficiencies among nursing students. For teaching hospitals, forming a team of professional staff to serve as trainers to implement SPs is vital. Applying SPs education throughout clinical rotations allows students to strengthen their awareness and practice of SPs.",
