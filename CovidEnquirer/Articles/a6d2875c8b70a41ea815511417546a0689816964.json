There are also particular issues in an outbreak of a novel pathogen due to difficulties in mobilizing the response and in development of testing capacities, as well as changes over time in the definition of SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms. There are therefore concerns the reported cases in countries outside of China may be an under-report of what is actually occurring. Previous work has estimated significant under reporting of COVID-19 cases in a number of countries such as Indonesia, Cambodia and Thailand. 6 A detailed understanding of the geographical distribution of case importation will help to guide resources to places with currently limited capacity to test, and provide support to perform control measures and support for clinical care.",

Early in the outbreak, Bogoch et al. listed the countries at most risk of importations given the number of flights from Wuhan. 7 Their ranking ultimately followed closely the countries that first reported imported cases, albeit with some countries predicted to report that did not. Since then others have used flight and other data to highlight countries at most risk of importation of SARS-CoV-2 from China. 8, 9 These papers have then used the infectious disease vulnerability index (IDVI) as an assessment of how at risk a country is to local transmission. 8, 9 In countries where importations are occurring, it will be important to quantify the risk of onward transmission occurring and the extent of this transmission. Kucharski et al. 10 considered this generally given the number of importations using a probabilistic model, and Wu et al estimated a probability of transmission within cities outside China. 4 However risk estimates of importations to countries outside China have been focused on the risk of importations from mainland China, with the risk being correlated with the connectivity of places in mainland China to other countries. [7] [8] [9] As transmission increasingly occurs in countries outside mainland China it may also become important to consider the risk of importations to and from other countries. Indeed there have already been cases outside of China, only reporting travel history to countries outside of China, such as from Singapore to the UK, 11 and from Thailand, Singapore and Japan to South Korea. 12 In light of this, there is some urgency to assessing the relative risks of onward transmission between countries outside of China.",

We modelled the offspring distribution of each case as a negative binomial distribution, with mean equal to the basic reproduction number estimated by Riou et al. 15 , and dispersion parameter assumed to be equal to that of SARS-CoV. 16 Using the first-step analysis, the local outbreak risk can be mathematically derived, where we created two scenarios for each country: (1) only the reported cases imported from Wuhan were immediately isolated, but the rest of the estimated cases were not (main analysis) and (2) immediate isolation of 95% of the estimated imported cases from Wuhan. Here, we assumed that immediately isolated cases were not able to cause any secondary infection throughout their infectious periods, and hence the local outbreak risk estimation was conservative. For the main analysis, we truncated the uncertainty distribution of the imported case count derived earlier using the reported case count, to ensure that the estimated total number of cases imported from Wuhan was always greater than or equal to the reported case count. Countries with a local outbreak risk above 0.5 in our main analysis were named as potential donor countries, and subsequently assessed for their relative potential of exporting SARS-CoV-2 to any recipient country or territory outside mainland China, described as follows.",

Therefore our estimates should be viewed as a lower bound on the number of imported infections, given possible mild and asymptomatic infections. Even given this, we estimate that Indonesiawhich has reported 0 cases to date-would be expected to have more cases than this, in line with estimates from Lipsitch et al. 6 .

This information was not used to generate our estimates, but provides some validation for the model. In countries such as Singapore, intensive contact tracing of cases and testing of all pneumonia cases was implemented 19 , increasing the likelihood of finding community transmission. The impact of control measures after initial detected cases is not included in our model, but may alter the risk of onward transmission and should be considered in further iterations of the model as in other modelling work considering impact interventions under different transmission scenarios. 20, 21 Other countries that we estimate to be at high risk of local transmission, but that have not yet detected transmission 18 include Indonesia, Cambodia, Canada and the Philippines. For all these places, our results suggest there could be a consideration of expanding testing of pneumonia or influenza like illness cases beyond those who have currently travelled, to find community transmission as soon as possible after it occurs, as has been ongoing in Singapore 19 and has been recommended recently in some areas of the US 22 .",

The first importations of cases to and from countries outside mainland China have already occurred, including from Singapore to the UK, 23 and Thailand, Japan and Singapore to the South Korea. 12 Singapore was second highest on our UK donor risk result list after Hong Kong and Japan, Singapore and Thailand were numbers 4, 5 and 6 on the South Korea's list after Macao, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Given our results and these observations, it would seem prudent for planning to consider the scenario in which the number of countries that may be both recipient and donors of importations will be increasing. Once transmission is confirmed in a possible donor country, our estimates of the risk transmission index are no longer needed, and the number of reported cases and the volume of traffic between countries are what will become important (see Table S3 ). However it must be considered that transmission may not always be detected quickly in all possible donor countries so estimates of the risk of transmission in donor countries may remain useful for planning. Though many of the countries at risk of second wave importations are similar to those at risk from Wuhan, there are some countries that we did not estimate as having the highest numbers of importations from Wuhan, but become at increased risk as we consider donor countries outside mainland China. These include India, New Zealand, Spain and Mexico, as they have greater links to countries outside mainland China than to Wuhan, China. With the first imported case in Africa recently reported in Egypt 24 (which was estimated to have the highest link with mainland China by Lai et al. 8 ,) we must assess where we are in the timeline of the outbreak with respect to importations to Africa, and including the risk of importation from not only mainland China could be important here.",

In addition, flights from other places in China to different countries will be truncated at different times for different countries depending on if and when countries halted incoming flights from China.

Given our results of high risk of onward transmission we highlight the importance of wider testing to pick up community transmission as soon as possible after transmission occurs. We also highlight countries that become at increased risk of importation as transmission occurs outside China, and provide results for each country to assess the countries that pose their highest risk of importation.
