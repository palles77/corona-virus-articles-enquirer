Many of these methods are becoming increasingly popular in the Western world, where they are classified as alternative or complementary medicine. Most of these techniques are untested and some are even considered dangerous in the modern day world, however, they are sometimes able to help, where modern medicine can not. Therefore, it would be wrong to totally reject them. The SINOPOLL project is a joint R&D effort between Thor Medical Systems LLC and their Chinese partner Shenzhen Anke. Its goal is to combine the vast traditional knowledge in TCM with modern day medical system technology. This paper gives an overview of this research, as well, as proposes several possible solutions for common problems in this field.",

With these ingredients, they can successfully cure many different diseases. These materials are almost exclusively mixed together, following recipes, to prepare potions. Some potions are used for inhalation. Most of these medications are available in over-the-counter (OTC) form; therefore it is hard to create statistics about their usage. A study, made in 2010 in Hong Kong by CH Chung et al. (2010.) revealed that a total of 50.8% of the questioned population used some kind of OTC western medicine, and a total of 26.2% of the respondents reported consuming Chinese OTC medication in the previous year. They also noted that \"patients with chronic diseases on western medications are also likely to consume Chinese herbal medicines\". Very few comparative studies exist to confirm or deny the TCM-s effectiveness in contrast to modern medical applications. This is mostly because the traditional Chinese healers reject direct comparison with the western doctors. Therefore it is hard to objectively verify their methods, but it is not our goal either. It is also important to state, that TCM methods are not considered as replacements for effective conventional medicine, but rather as complementary methods. As such, they can provide hope in situations, where modern medicine is ineffective yet.",

More importantly, it does not include objective, quantitative measurement methods like the ones used by modern medicine. The most important diagnostic methods in TCM are the visual examination of the tongue, and audio examination of the pulse and breathing. Traditional diagnostic methods are widely documented in the work of Marcus and Kuchera (2005.) . These are however subjective methods that rely solely on the practitioners' experience, since no objective data can be measured. It is especially hard to reliably recognise the lung related and respiratory illnesses that are mostly induced by modern day problems like city life and industrialization. These illnesses are however becoming increasingly common in China and in other parts of the world as well. Because the practices of TCM date back several hundreds or even thousands of years, TCM is not prepared to effectively treat these kinds of modern life related illnesses. An instructive example was the 2002 epidemic outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China that has later spread to other parts of the world due to global air travel. After that, many researchers recognised that the integration of TCM with modern medicine (MM) yields promising results in the treatment of SARS. Chen, Gou and al. (2007.) summarized the available works in this field and came to the conclusion that the experience with the integration of TCM with MM in the treatment of SARS was encouraging, and thus more such work is needed.",

Therefore it is advisable to outfit the proposed home diagnostic and treatment devices with such touch screens.

On the other hand, complicated touch screen user interfaces can increase the software development cost significantly, so there is a trade-off. Display panels with touch screens are also much easier to clean than mechanical controls. They require absolutely no moving parts, and can be completely sealed, therefore water-and dustproof. The reduction of the numbers of switches and potentiometers also mean the reduction of moving and thus deteriorating parts, and it also reduces costs.

These devices can take the tasks of a remote controller or a data logger, therefore reducing overall system cost. An example of this is the functionality of ThorMed's Otthon mobile spirometer that is the ability to synchronize device database with a PC to archive data. The contents of the device can be archived directly to ThorSoft Pulmonary Diagnostics PC software. Developing PC software can also be more cost efficient than embedded systems. Also the integration of a printer is not required if the device can connect to any commercially available USB printer and print out reports of current and older measurements.",

Therefore, a significant cost reduction can be achieved by finding a proper partitioning between safety critical and non safety critical components within a specific system. Only the components considered safety critical should be designed and verified according to the specific standards, while other, less critical components can be designed with less expenses and additional cost can be saved on their testing and evaluation. Accurately defining the safety critical parts of a highly integrated system is however not a trivial task and although there are some formal methods, the most part of it must be done intuitively. General rules exist that can help the classification. For example, the user interface is mostly not safety critical. Standalone diagnostic and data acquisition systems are also for the most part not safety critical. However, a processing algorithm of a sensor which's failure can cause a dangerous situation must be considered safety critical and implemented according to the relevant standards.",

As was stated in this paper, the main research areas of this project are the new diagnostic methods, and new treatment or administering methods. It was determined, that most of the modern medical systems can be adapted for use in TCM. Also a significant part of this research and development effort was cost reduction. Using the aforementioned methods and techniques, it was possible to successfully reduce the overall costs of the proposed devices and systems.",
