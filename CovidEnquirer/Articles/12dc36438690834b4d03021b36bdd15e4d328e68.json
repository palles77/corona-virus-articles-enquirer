            "text": "Mother's milk delivered naturally through breast-feeding has been the sole source of infant nutrition in mammalian species for millions of years. Since human beings learned to domesticate cattle about 10,000 years ago, nonhuman mammalian milk also has been used to supplement or replace maternal milk in human infants. The development and widespread use of commercially prepared infant formula products have been phenomena of the 20th century and notably of the past 6 decades. Such products provide an alternative to breast-feeding that is useful in certain situations. Nonetheless, compelling evidence shows that breast-feeding is an ideal source of infant nutrition, whose use is associated with lower rates of postneonatal infant mortality in the United States and in other parts of the world [1] [2] [3] . Human milk helps to protect infants against a wide variety of infections; helps to reduce the risk for allergic and autoimmune diseases, the risk of obesity and its complications, and the risk for certain types of neoplasms later in life; and has been associated with slightly better performances on tests of cognitive development in some studies [3] . For these reasons, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that in the absence of specific contraindications (see \"Benefits and Risks of Human Milk\"), healthy term infants should be exclusively breast-fed or fed expressed breast milk beginning within the first hour after birth through 6 months of age [1, 3] .",

These investigations have led to the development of concepts of immunity on mucosal surfaces of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts and identification of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and local mechanisms of defense that are distinct from the internal (systemic) immune system. This chapter reviews existing information on major aspects of the physiologic, nutritional, immunologic, and anti-infective components of the products of lactation. Evidence on the contribution of human milk to the development of immunologic integrity in the infant and its influence on the outcome of infections and other hostantigen interactions is also discussed.",

These initial phases of development occur in both genders (Table 5-1) . Further development in the male apparently is limited, however, by androgenic or other male-associated substances [6, 7] . Castration in male rat embryos early in gestation leads to female breast development, whereas ovariectomy in female rat embryos does not alter the course of development of the mammary anlage. Toward the end of pregnancy, initial phases of fetal mammary differentiation seem to occur under the influence of placental and transplacentally acquired maternal hormones, with transient development of the excretory and lactiferous ductular systems. Such growth, differentiation, and secretory activities are transient and regress soon after birth [7, 8] .",

Adoptive breastfeeding also is well documented in primitive human societies. Sudden and permanent cessation of suckling can result in the termination of milk secretion and involution of the breast to the prepregnant state as the concentrations of prolactin decline.

The stimulation of the nipple by suckling activates a neural pathway that results in release of prolactin and oxytocin. Prolactin is responsible for stimulating milk production, whereas oxytocin stimulates milk ejection (the combination is known as the let-down reflex). Oxytocin also stimulates uterine contractions, which the mother may feel while she is breast-feeding; this response helps to restore the uterus to prepregnancy tone. Milk production and ejection depend on the complex interaction of stimulation by the infant's suckling, neural reflex of the hypothalamus to such stimulation, release of hormones from the anterior and posterior pituitary, and response of the mammary gland to these hormones to complete the cycle.",

Triacylglycerols serve as precursors for prostaglandins, steroids, and phospholipids and as carriers for fat-soluble vitamins. The lipid profiles of human milk differ dramatically from the lipid profiles of commercial formulas, and despite considerable adaptation of such formulas, human milk lipids are absorbed more efficiently by the infant. Cholesterol, an important lipid constituent of human milk (12 mg/dL), usually is found in only trace amounts in commercial formulas. It has been suggested that cholesterol may be an essential nutrient for the neonate [40] . A lack of cholesterol in early development may result in turning on of cholesterol-synthetic mechanisms that are difficult to turn off later in life, influencing induction of hypercholesterolemia [41] . Some studies suggest that breast-feeding of the neonate is associated with lowered adult serum cholesterol levels and reduced deaths from ischemic heart disease [42] .",

They are structural components of brain and retinal membranes and may be important for cognitive and visual development. In addition, they may have a role in preventing atopy [43] . Numerous studies have found that infants fed formula without docosahexaenoic acid or arachidonic acid have reduced red blood cell amounts of these fatty acids [44] [45] [46] ; however, findings in visual and cognitive functional studies in term infants have been inconsistent [47, 48] . These studies have been complicated by the finding of slower growth in some preterm infants fed formulas supplemented with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids [45, 46] . The inconsistent findings in infants fed supplemented formula may reflect the difficulty in determining the optimal amounts of docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid and their precursors linoleic and linolenic acids in such supplemented formulas. These lipids seem to be best delivered from human milk.",

On the basis of available information, most IgAproducing cells observed in milk have their origin in the precursor immunocompetent cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). Exposure of IgA precursor B lymphocytes in GALT or BALT to microbial and dietary antigens in the mucosal lumen is an important prerequisite for their initial activation and proliferation. Such antigen-sensitized cells eventually are transported through the systemic circulation to other mucosal surfaces, including the mammary glands, and, as plasma cells, initiate the synthesis of immunoglobulin against specific antigens previously experienced in the mucosa of the respiratory or alimentary tract [87] . It has been proposed that T cells observed in the milk also may be derived from GALT and BALT in a manner similar to that of IgA-producing cells. Little or no information is available regarding the site of origin of other cellular or soluble immunologic components normally present in human milk. Specific antibody and cellular immune reactivity against many respiratory and enteric bacterial and viral pathogens and ingested food proteins also is present in human breast milk (Table 5 -5).",

Few mononuclear cells were present in the nonlactating breast of nulliparous and of parous women, although IgA-containing cells predominated. Synthesis of IgA seemed to be slightly increased in the parous women. IgA was found in the mammary tissues during the proliferative stage of the menstrual cycle in the nulliparous women and during the luteal phase in the parous women. The number of IgA-producing cells in the nonlactating breast was observed to increase with parity. These findings suggest that the immunologic makeup of the nonlactating and the lactating breast may be significantly influenced by the hormonal milieu.",

In limited observations, combinations of prolactin with estrogen and progesterone (in concentrations observed normally at the beginning of parturition) seemed to have an amplifying effect on the synthesis and secretion of IgA from peripheral blood lymphocytes [99] . This observation raises the possibility that the high levels of sIgA observed in colostrum and milk may be partly the result of selective, hormonally mediated proliferation of antigen-sensitized IgA cells in the peripheral blood. The immunoglobulin could acquire a secretory component during its passage through the mammary epithelium and eventually appear in the colostrum or milk as mature sIgA. Although the appearance of sIgA antibody in milk characteristically follows antigenic exposure in GALT or BALT, the precise nature of the IgA content in milk seems to be determined by various other factors operating in the mucosal lymphoid tissue. These factors include the dendritic cell and regulatory T-cell network in GALT and possibly in BALT [100, 101] , the nature of antigens (soluble proteins versus particulate microbial agents) [102] , and the route of primary versus secondary antigenic exposure [103] .",

Colostrum and milk can inhibit the activity of E. coli and Vibrio cholerae enterotoxins in experimental settings [112] . The antitoxic activity of human milk seems to correlate well with its IgA content, but not with its IgM and IgG content. Precoating of V. cholerae with specific sIgA protects infant mice from disease [113] . Similar results have been obtained by using specific purified milk sIgA in preventing E. coli-induced and Shigella dysenteriaeinduced disease in rabbits [114] . Less definite, but suggestive, is a study conducted with human milk feeding relative to the intestinal replication of orally administered live poliovirus vaccine [115] . This study found that breast-feeding may reduce the degree of seroconversion for poliovirus antibody in the vaccinated infants. Because antipolio IgA is present in human milk and colostrum, the investigators concluded that specific IgA may bind poliovirus and influence viral replication in the intestinal mucosa. Extensive experience with oral polio immunization worldwide has not found a convincing association, however, between breast-feeding and live vaccine failures. Other studies have shown that the magnitude of poliovirus replication in the intestine is determined by the presence and level of preexisting sIgA antibody. With high levels of intestinal IgA antibody, little or no replication of vaccine virus was observed in the gut. With lower levels, varying degrees of viral replication could be shown [116] . Epidemiologic studies strongly support the notion that breast-feeding protects the infant against infectious diseases (see \"Benefits and Risks of Human Milk\"). It is impossible in these studies, however, to dissect the relative contribution of sIgA from the contributions of other soluble or cellular components present in colostrum and milk.",

By the end of the first week of lactation, cell concentration is of the order of 10 5 cells/mL. Total cell numbers delivered to the newborn throughout lactation may remain constant, however, when adjustments are made for the increase in volume of milk produced [89] . The two major cell populations in human milk-macrophages and neutrophils-are difficult to distinguish by common staining methods because of numerous intracytoplasmic inclusions. More accurate estimates made by flow cytometry analysis suggest that the relative percentages of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes in early milk samples are approximately 80%, 15%, and 4% [122, 123] . The remaining cells are present in smaller amounts, especially in the absence of active suckling, engorgement, or local breast infection.",

Although several investigators have been unable to show in vitro antibody synthesis by milk lymphocytes, studies performed with colostral B cells transformed by Epstein-Barr virus showed production of IgG and J-chain-containing IgM and IgA [137] . A small population of CD16 \u00fe natural killer (NK) cells also can be identified in most milk samples, but cannot be accurately quantitated [123] . In functional studies, colostral cells exhibit NK cytotoxicity, however, which is enhanced by interferon (IFN) and IL-2. Colostral cells also elicit antibody-dependent and lectindependent cellular cytotoxic responses. The NK and the antibody-dependent and lectin-dependent responses in colostral cells have been observed to be significantly lower than those of autologous peripheral blood cells. Reduced cellular cytotoxicity of colostral cells also has been observed against virus-infected targets and certain bacteria. With several specific virus-infected targets, colostrum and milk cells conspicuously lack cellular cytotoxicity compared with autologous peripheral blood cells. There is also an apparent exclusion of cytolytic T cells in the milk that are specific for certain human leukocyte antigens (HLA) [138, 139] .",

Several studies have shown a selectivity in lymphocyte stimulation responses in colostral and milk lymphocytes to various antigens compared with peripheral blood lymphocyte responses [140, 141] . Antigens such as rubella virus stimulate T lymphocytes in secretory sites and milk and in systemic sites [140] .

Macrophage-T cell interactions also have been postulated to be responsible for this relative hyporesponsiveness [140] , although it is unknown whether the effects are the result of decreased helper or increased regulatory function. Studies have shown that milk lymphocytes exhibit reduced responses to allogeneic cells, but display good ability to stimulate alloreactivity [138] . Generally, the T-cell proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin and tetanus toxoid in breast-fed infants seem to be significantly higher than the responses in bottle-fed infants, possibly secondary to the presence of maternally derived cell growth factors and other lymphokines in human milk [136, 142] .",

In addition, the proportion of T cells that display other phenotypic markers of activation, including CD25 (IL-2R) and HLA-DR, is much greater than that in blood [123, 144] . Consistent with their memory phenotype, T cells in human milk produce IFN-g [143] . A significantly greater number of CD4 \u00fe T cells in colostrum express the CD40 ligand (CD40L), which helps these cells provide help for B-cell antibody production and macrophage activation (see Chapter 4 for more details) compared with autologous or heterologous blood T cells [145] . The function of these memory T cells in the recipient human infant is currently unknown, however. Mucous membrane sites in the alimentary or respiratory tract, or both, of the recipient infant would seem to be potential entry sites for human milk leukocytes. Very few memory T cells are detected in blood in infancy [146] . It is possible that maternal memory T cells in milk may help compensate for the developmental delay in their production in the infant.",

It seems that these factors are responsible to a great extent, however, for the predominance of Lactobacillus species in the bacterial flora of the large intestine of the breast-fed infant. These bacteria produce large amounts of acetic acid, which aids in suppressing the multiplication of enteropathogens. It also has been reported that Lactobacillus species strain GG aids in the recovery from acute rotavirus infections [179] and may enhance the formation of circulating cells that produce specific antibodies of the IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes and serum levels of those antibodies [180] .",

Proinflammatory mediators are poorly represented in human milk [213] . By contrast, human milk contains a host of anti-inflammatory agents [214] , including a heterogeneous group of growth factors with cytoprotective and trophic activity for the mucosal epithelium, antioxidants, antiproteases, cytokines and cytokine receptors and antagonists, and other bioactive agents that inhibit inflammatory mediators or block the selected activation of leukocytes.

These and a host of hormones [221] , including insulin-like growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, growth hormone-releasing factor, hepatocyte growth factor, prolactin, leptin, and cortisol [222] , may affect the growth and maturation of epithelial barriers, limit the penetration of pathogenic microorganisms and free antigens, and prevent allergic sensitization. Corticosterone, a glucocorticoid that is present in high concentrations in rat milk, speeds gut closure in the neonatal rat [223] . Although macromolecular absorption does not seem to be as marked in the human neonate [224] [225] [226] , the function of the mucosal barrier system in early infancy is important to host defense, and this system may be affected by factors in human milk.

IL-10 is present not only in the aqueous phase of the milk, but also in the lipid layer. Its bioactive properties were confirmed by the finding that human milk samples inhibited blood lymphocyte proliferation and that this property was greatly reduced by treatment with anti-IL-10 antibody. Mice with a targeted disruption in the IL-10 gene, when raised under conventional housing conditions, spontaneously develop a generalized enterocolitis that becomes apparent at the age of 4 to 8 weeks (time of weaning) [232] . These observations suggest that IL-10 in rat milk, and perhaps in human milk, may play a crucial role in the homeostasis of the immature intestinal barrier by regulating aberrant immune responses to foreign antigens.",

Several studies have reported increased serum antibody titers to H. influenzae type b polysaccharide [246] , oral poliovirus [247] , tetanus [248] , and diphtheria toxoid [249] immunizations in breast-fed infants. In regard to cell-mediated immunity, breast-fed infants given bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine at birth or later show a significantly higher lymphocyte transformation response to purified protein derivative than infants who were never breast-fed [249] . Maternal renal allografts survive better in individuals who were breast-fed than in individuals who were not [250] [251] [252] . In this respect, the in vitro allogeneic responses between the blood lymphocytes of mothers (stimulating cells) and their infants (responding cells), as measured by an analysis of the frequencies of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors directed against HLA alloantigens (CTL allorepertoire), are low in breast-fed infants [253] . l Increased levels of certain immune factors in breastfed infants, which could not be explained simply by passive transfer of those substances, also suggest immunomodulatory activity of human milk. Breastfed infants produce higher blood levels of IFN in response to respiratory syncytial virus infection [254] . It also was found that the increments in blood levels of fibronectin that were achieved by breast-feeding could not be due to the amounts of that protein in human milk [208] . In addition, it was found that human milk feeding led to a more rapid development in the appearance of sIgA in external secretions [202, 204, 110, 248, 255] , some of which, such as urine, are far removed anatomically from the route of ingestion [204, 110] . l Breast milk inhibits the response of human adult and fetal intestinal epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes to ligand-induced activation by toll-like receptor 2 and TLR3, but augments activation via TLR4 and TLR5 [256] . Inhibition of activation via TLR2 seemed to be mediated by a soluble form of this receptor [257] , whereas augmentation of TLR4 signaling was associated with an as yet uncharacterized protein. These immunomodulatory activities were not present in infant formula. These results suggest that breast milk can modulate the gut innate immune recognition of and response to microbes, which may affect the nature of the gut microbial flora (e.g., microbiome) and risk for disease in early and later life [258, 259] .",

Several different types of immunomodulatory agents can be identified in human milk [214] . Among the numerous substances with proven or potential ability to modulate the infant immune response are prolactin [260] , a-tocopherol [229] , lactoferrin [261] , nucleotides [67] , anti-idiotypic sIgA [262] , and cytokines [263] . It is evident that many of these factors in milk have other primary biologic functions, as in the case of hormones or growth factors, and that their potential as immunoregulatory agents overlaps with their antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory properties [214] .",

            "text": "In the 1990s, several cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that mediate the effector phases of natural and specific immunity were discovered in human milk, and many more have been identified subsequently (Table 5-8) . Human milk displays numerous biologic activities characteristic of cytokines, including the stimulation of growth, differentiation of immunoglobulin production by B cells [125, 264, 265] , enhancement of thymocyte proliferation [266] , inhibition of IL-2 production by T cells [267] , and suppression of IgE production [239] . IL-1b [268] and TNF-a [269] were the first two cytokines quantified in human milk. In colostrum, TNF-a is present mainly in fractions of molecular weight of 80 to 195 kDa, probably bound to its soluble receptors [233] . Milk TNF-a is secreted by milk macrophages [269, 270] and by the mammary epithelium [271] . IL-6 was first shown in human milk by a specific bioassay [272] . In this study, anti-IL-6-neutralizing antibodies inhibited IgA production by colostrum mononuclear cells, suggesting that IL-6 may be involved in the production of IgA in the mammary gland. The presence of IL-6 in milk also has been shown by immunoassays [269, 271, 273, 274] . Similarly, IL-6 is localized in highmolecular-weight fractions of human milk [273] . The association of IL-6 with its own receptor has not been studied in milk, although the expression of IL-6 receptor by the mammary epithelium [271] and in secreted form in the milk [233] may explain the high molecular weight of this cytokine in human milk. The expression of IL-6 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein in milk cells and in the mammary gland epithelium suggests that milk mononuclear cells and the mammary gland are likely major sources of this cytokine [270, 271, 275] .",

(The presence and possible function of IL-10 in human milk are discussed in \"Anti-inflammatory Agents.\") Chemokines are a novel class of small cytokines with discrete target cell selectivity that are able to recruit and activate different populations of leukocytes (see Chapter 4) . Chemokines are grouped into families, which are defined by the spacing between cysteine residues (see Chapter 4). CXC chemokines, in which cysteine pairs are separated by one amino acid, and CC chemokines, in which paired cysteines are adjacent to each other, are found in human milk. Certain CXC chemokines that contain an ELR motif, including CXCL8 (also known as IL-8) and CXCL1 (GRO-a), predominantly attract neutrophils, whereas basophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, monocytes, and specific subsets of T and B lymphocytes are attracted by specific CC chemokines and non-ELR CXC chemokines. The presence of many CXC and CC chemokines has been described in human milk (see Table 5 -8) [275] [276] [277] [278] .",

Comparative studies conducted during the first 12 weeks of lactation suggest that the mean concentrations of lactoferrin and lysozyme are higher in preterm than in term milk. sIgA is the predominant immunoglobulin in preterm and in term milk, although the sIgA concentration seems to be significantly higher in preterm milk collected during the first 8 to 12 weeks of lactation. sIgA antibody activity against certain organisms (E. coli somatic antigen) in the preterm milk was observed to be less than, or at best similar to, that found in term milk. In addition, the number of lymphocytes and macrophages in milk seems to be lower at 2 weeks, but significantly higher at 12 weeks in milk from mothers with preterm (born at 34 to 38 weeks of gestational age) infants than in milk from mothers with fullterm infants [288] . The authors of these investigations have proposed that some of the observed changes may reflect the lower volume of milk produced by mothers delivered of preterm infants. The possibility remains that changes in the immunologic profile of preterm milk may be a consequence of inadequate stimulation by the preterm infant, alterations in the maternal hormonal milieu, or other factors underlying premature delivery itself.",

Longitudinal followup of a large cohort of infants during a community outbreak of rotavirus has shown that attack rates of rotavirus infection were similar in breast-fed and in bottle-fed infants. The frequency of clinical disease with diarrhea seemed to be significantly lower in breast-fed infants, however. The protection observed in these patients was more a reflection of altered microbial flora from breastfeeding than of specific immunologic protection against rotavirus. Breast milk contains sIgA directed against rotavirus, with the greatest concentrations in colostrum and lower amounts in mature milk; neutralization of rotavirus by breast milk correlates imperfectly with antibody concentrations measured by enzyme immunoassay, suggesting that other factors present in milk contribute to rotavirus neutralization [301] . It seems that breast-feeding provides significant protection against diarrheal disease, although the mechanisms of such protection remain to be more fully defined [299, 300] .",

Some pediatric centers have claimed virtual absence of necrotizing enterocolitis in breast-fed infants; however, many instances of the failure of milk feeding to prevent human necrotizing enterocolitis also have been reported [307] . Outbreaks of necrotizing enterocolitis related to Klebsiella and Salmonella species secondary to banked human milk feedings have been documented [124, 308, 309] . In an asphyxiated neonatal rat model of necrotizing enterocolitis, the entire syndrome could be prevented with feeding of maternal milk. The crucial factor in the milk seemed to be the cells, probably the macrophages [124] . It also is possible that antibody and nonspecific factors play a role, as does establishment of a gut flora. Prophylactic oral administration of immunoglobulin has been found to have a profound influence on the outcome of necrotizing enterocolitis in well-controlled studies [309] . Penetration of the gut by pathogens and antigens is increased with ischemic damage, and noncellular elements of milk may aid in blockage of this transit [310] .",

The first study [241] consisted of prospective, long-term evaluation from infancy until age 17 years; the prevalence of atopy was significantly higher in infants with short-duration (<1 month) or no breastfeeding, which increased to a demonstrable difference by age 17 years, than in infants with intermediate-duration (1 to 6 months) or prolonged (>6 months) breast-feeding. The differences in the prevalence of atopy persisted when the groups were divided according to positive or negative atopic heredity. The atopy manifestations in the different infant feeding groups did not remain constant with age. In particular, respiratory allergy, including asthma, increased greatly in prevalence up to age 17 years, with a prevalence of 64% in the group with short-duration or no breast-feeding [241] .",

Children who were never breast-fed had significantly higher rates of recurrent wheezing at 6 years of age. Increasing duration of breast-feeding beyond 1 month was not associated with significantly lower rates of recurrent wheezing. The effect of breast-feeding was apparent for children with and without wheezing lower respiratory tract illnesses in the first 6 months of life.

These mucosal immunologic events have been the basis for the concept of immune exclusion. Immune exclusion is not absolute, however, because uptake of some antigens across the gut may be enhanced rather than blocked by interaction with antibody at the mucosal surface. Beginning with the observations of IgA-deficient patients, it has become clear that the absence of the IgA barrier in the gut is associated with an increased incidence of circulating antibodies directed against many food antigens and an increased occurrence of atopic-allergic diseases [325] . Some studies have noted complement activation in serum after feeding of bovine milk to children with cow's milk allergy. The neonate is similar in some respects to the IgA-deficient patient [327] , and increased transintestinal uptake of food antigen with consequent circulating antibody formation in the premature infant has been reported [328] . Other studies have suggested that early breast-feeding, even of short duration, is associated with a decreased serum antibody response to cow's milk proteins [226] . Prolonged breast-feeding not only may partially exclude foreign antigens through immune exclusion, but may also, because the mother's milk is the infant's sole food, prevent their ingestion [329] . Intact bovine milk proteins and other food antigens and antibodies have been observed, however, in samples of colostrum and milk [8] .",

Adoptive experiments in suckling ferrets have shown that protection of the young against respiratory syncytial virus can be transferred in colostrum containing specific antibody.

Inappropriate introduction of bottles and pacifiers also may interfere with proper induction of lactation. Later in lactation, introduction of bottles may induce premature weaning as the result of a reduction in the milk supply.",

Mothers who have received radionuclides for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes should use alternative forms of nutrition for the days to weeks required for these compounds to be eliminated, as should mothers receiving certain chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressive agents and actively using drugs of abuse, including amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, and phencyclidine [343] . Lowlevel maternal exposure to environmental chemicals and tobacco smoking should be avoided as much as possible, but are not a contraindication to breast-feeding.",

In each of these instances, several case reports have appeared warning against deficiencies that have resulted in clinical consequences to the neonate. Hemorrhagic disease reported in a few breastfed infants was successfully treated with vitamin K [345] . These infants did not receive vitamin K at birth. Mothers who practice unusual dietary habits, such as strict vegetarianism, may have reduced levels of vitamin B 12 and folic acid in their milk, and deficiencies in breast-fed infants of such mothers have been reported [346, 347] . Cases of rickets in breast-fed infants have been reported, particularly during winter among infants not exposed to the sun [34, 348] . Deficiency of carnitine, a nutrient responsible for modulating fat absorption, also has been reported to result in clinical symptoms in breast-fed infants in mothers ingesting unusual diets [61, 349] . These concerns can best be addressed in almost all cases by counseling mothers regarding nutritional practices and by the provision of supplemental vitamins and other micronutrients when appropriate; this is the case in the developed world and even more so in the developing world where the untoward consequences of not breast-feeding are particularly great [293] .",

These guidelines help to ensure that donors are screened for transmissible infections and that the milk is carefully collected, processed, and stored. Using these practices, donor milk is collected and pooled and subjected to Holder pasteurization (62.5 C) for 30 minutes, which reliably kills bacteria and inactivates HIV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) and eliminates or substantially reduces the amounts of other viruses. The pooled milk is tested to ensure that it meets standards and is frozen for later distribution and use.",

In areas of the world where infectious diseases and malnutrition are important causes of death early in life, the beneficial effects of breast-feeding often outweigh the potential risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding. Studies in such settings have shown that HIVfree survival at 7 months of age is similar in exposed infants that were breast-fed or formula-fed from birth [360] [361] [362] . Studies in Africa show that mothers who exclusively breast-feed in the first 6 months of life have reduced risk of HIV transmission compared with mothers who supplement breast-feeding with other foods and milk sources [360, 361, 363] . In areas of the world where the burden of infectious diseases and malnutrition is high and where alternatives to breast milk that provide adequate nutrition are unacceptable, affordable, feasible, and safe, exclusive breast-feeding is recommended by the WHO and other authorities for women whose HIV status is unknown and for women known to be HIVinfected [293, 344, 358, 364] . The WHO policy also stresses the need for continued support for breast-feeding by mothers who are HIV-negative, improved access to HIV counseling and testing, and government efforts to ensure uninterrupted access to nutritionally adequate human milk substitutes [344] .",

Milk antibodies seem to provide protection against many intestinal pathogens, such as Campylobacter, Shigella, E. coli, V. cholerae, Giardia, and rotavirus, and against respiratory pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus. Milk antibodies also effectively neutralize toxins and various human viruses. The role of small amounts of IgG and IgM in milk is uncertain. Milk IgA antibodies generally induce antimicrobial protection in the absence of any inflammation. Lactoferrin, lysozyme, a-lactalbumin, and other milk proteins and carbohydrates and lipids also contribute to the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of human milk. Milk also contains numerous cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, soluble TLRs, and CD14, which modulate inflammatory and immunologic responses in the gut.",

            "text": "The passive transfer of the diversity of maternal biologic experiences to the neonate through the process of breast-feeding represents an essential component of the survival mechanism in the mammalian neonate. For millions of years, maternal products of lactation delivered through the process of breast-feeding have been the sole source of nutrition and immunity during the neonatal period and early infancy for all mammals, including the human infant. During the past 150 to 300 years, human societies have undergone remarkable changes, which have had a major impact on the basic mechanisms of maternal-neonatal interaction, breastfeeding, and the environment. Such changes include introduction of sanitation and nonhuman milk and formula feeds for neonatal nutrition, use of antimicrobial agents, introduction of processed foods, and exposure to newer environmental macromolecules and dietary antigens. The introduction of such human-made changes in the neonatal environment has had a profound impact on human homeostatic mechanisms, while allowing new insights into the role of breast-feeding in the developing human neonate.",

            "text": "Comparative analysis of natural (traditional) forms of breast-feeding and artificial feeding modalities has shown that natural breast-feeding is associated with significant reduction in infant mortality and morbidity; protection against acute infectious diseases; and possible protection against allergic disorders and autoimmune disease, acute and chronic inflammatory disorders, obesity, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders, allograft rejection, and development of many malignant conditions in childhood or later in life. This information has been reviewed by Hanson in an elegant monograph [372] and by others [86] . Despite the overwhelmingly protective role attributed to natural breast-feeding and the evolutionary advantages related to the development of lactation, several infectious agents have acquired, during the course of evolution, the ability to evade immunologic factors in milk and to use milk as the vehicle for maternal-to-infant transmission. The potential for the acquisition of infections, including HIV, HTLV, CMV, and possibly other pathogens, highlights potential hazards of breast-feeding in some clinical situations. It is reasonable to conclude that the development of lactation, the hallmark of mammalian evolution, is designed to enhance the survival of the neonate of the species and that breast-feeding may have a remarkable spectrum of immediate and long-term protective functions.",
