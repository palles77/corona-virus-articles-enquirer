One presented with upper airway signs, and was identified to have a focal laryngeal lesion. The other had central neurological signs at the terminal stages, with intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies identified within the cerebral hemispheres on histopathology. Relevance and novel information Currently, cowpox would be an unlikely consideration in patients with neurological signs or upper respiratory noise. These cases both document novel presentations of cowpox infection, which clinicians should be aware of and consider as differential diagnoses in patients with these atypical presentations.",

            "text": "A number of different poxviruses can infect both people and domestic animals; with cowpox being the best described and most commonly encountered poxvirus infection of cats. Cowpox virus (CPxV) is a member of Orthopoxviridae family and is endemic in Northern Europe and western areas of the Soviet Union. 1 The usual route of infection is via skin inoculation from infected rodent bites, typically voles, or rarely via oronasal infection. 2 Reflective of this transmission route, skin lesions are commonly found on the head, neck and forelimbs. However, systemic illness such as pyrexia, anorexia, lethargy and/or pneumonia can occur during the viraemic phase and is usually associated with immune dysfunction and death. 3, 4 It is important that clinicians recognise the signs of potential CPxV infection and perform appropriate diagnostics early. A significant factor contributing to the prognosis of CPxV infection in cats is the speed at which appropriate therapy is instituted, so rapid recognition is crucial. Cytological analysis of the affected organs can be misleading, with the secondarily dysplastic cells having the potential to mimic neoplasma. Instead, electron microscopy, virus isolation and PCR of tissues (including skin scabs, bronchoalveolar or pleural fluid, or pulmonary aspirates) are the easiest ways to confirm the diagnosis. 5 Serum assays (including virus neutralisation, haemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation and ELISA) can be utilised to detect a humoral response to Novel characteristics identified in two cases of feline cowpox virus infection orthopoxvirus, although a rising titre is required to support active infection. 4 Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics to control secondary bacterial infection and recombinant feline interferon omega (rFeIFN-\u03c9) to modulate the immune response. Antiviral drugs, such as famciclovir, commonly used for the treatment of feline herpesvirus (FeHV-1) disease in cats, 6 could also be considered; however, their efficacy against CPxV is unknown.",

Histopathology of this lesion identified a complete loss of the epidermis, and expansion of the dermis with an inflammatory infiltrate dominated by macrophages, neutrophils (mature and degenerate) and occasional lymphocytes. There were extensive areas of cell necrosis with well-demarcated, eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies ( Figure 5 ). The post-mortem examination also showed multifocal to coalescing, raised, alopecic and erythematous lesions affecting all four limbs. The lungs had multifocal areas of consolidation, with small quantities of white foam within the terminal bronchi. The pericardium was thickened with a moderately increased amount of pericardial fluid. As neurological changes were evident clinically, histopathology of the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum was performed. There was marked microgliosis of all areas, with many having abundant cytoplasm within them. Occasionally eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were identified ( Figure 5) .",

This cat responded well to treatment and had no evidence of pulmonary pathology during investigations. This case shows that CPxV infection should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of focal disease of the respiratory tract, as well as the more commonly recognised cutaneous and lower respiratory presentations. Reported clinical signs for CPxV infection are typically skin lesions (commonly found on the head, neck and forelimbs) and, rarely, fatal necrotising pneumonia. 4, [7] [8] [9] [10] Interestingly, no skin lesions were evident in this casethis has previously been described in a single cat with CPxV pneumonia. 11 The lack of cutaneous pathology may reflect the fact that, in rare cases, the virus can be transmitted by the oronasal route. 12 Case 2 had classic dermatological signs, with no clinical or imaging findings consistent with pulmonary disease (although these were apparent on post-mortem There are also eosinophilic inclusion bodies found within the cytoplasm of the microglia (arrows), consistent with CPxV infection evaluation). This cat began to display neurological signs, consistent of sensorium changes, as well as anisocoria, likely secondary to viral infection of the CNS (with consistent findings on histopathology). This has not been reported in previous case series. From this case we now know that CPxV infection should remain a differential in cats with neurological signs, particularly if accompanied with dermatological and/or respiratory involvement.",
