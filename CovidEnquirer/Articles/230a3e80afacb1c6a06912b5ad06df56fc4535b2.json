Preferential recourse to the use of alcohol based hand rub instead of hand washing. 10 In this sense, hand hygiene is thought to be the most important preventive measure, working as the main action to reduce those infections and cross-transmission of said pathogens, especially the multi-resistant ones, 8,9,11\u221215 including the oral healthcare setting. 16 In medical teams, the low adherence to HH remains as a major issue in the healthcare context. Recent highlights on epidemiology suggest new approaches to health promotion monitoring HH 8 that include direct observation, self-reporting by healthcare workers, measurement of HH product usage, and electronic methods. However, no ideal method of monitoring HH compliance has been developed. 17 A clear understanding of the transmission process through the hands is crucial for success of the learning process. 8 The patients and the dental healthcare personnel (DHCP) can be exposed to pathogenic microorganisms including cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococci, streptococci, and other viruses and bacteria that colonize or infect the oral cavity and respiratory tract. 18 These organisms can be transmitted in dental settings through: (1) direct contact with blood, oral fluids, or other patient materials; (2) indirect contact with contaminated objects such as instruments, equipment, or environmental surfaces; (3) contact of conjunctiva, nasal, or oral mucosa with droplets (e.g., spatter) containing microorganisms generated from an in-fected person and propelled a short distance (e.g., by coughing, sneezing, or talking); and (4) inhalation of airborne microorganisms that can remain suspended in the air for long periods. 18 It has been well documented that dental procedures can introduce oral pathogens into the bloodstream or lymphatic system via direct hematogenous spread or aspiration, thereby causing various medical conditions including bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, coronary heart disease, preterm low birth weight, infective endocarditis, gastrointestinal infections, and osteogenic and prosthetic implant infections. 19 In the present era of severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian flu, Influenza A (H1N1), and global problems with multiresistant pathogens, reliable information about these aspects is highly relevant. The importance of infection control in dentistry cannot be underestimated. 20 There have been reports of potential cross-contamination with MRSA in dental clinics. 21 It is essential to revise infection control measures in dental practices to accommodate these concerns. 22 Because of the impossibility of identifying possible carriers of important pathogens such as HIV and HBV, among others, it is recommended that every patient, indiscriminately be considered as being potentially contaminated and that standardized protective measures be used before performing an invasive procedure. 18 This work purpose was evaluating by the observational method the compliance of mouth health professionals with the hand hygiene good practices. With this type of study, the compliance rate with guidelines is evidenced, since the method may supply more accurate information.",
