The spectrum of disease can range from asymptomatic infections to severe disease with dehydration, which can be fatal. Diarrheal disease continues to be a major cause of mortality in young children, particularly in developing countries. Prior to 1972, the etiology of most episodes of gastroenteritis was unknown, and cases were attributed to a multitude of causes, including teething, weaning, diet, old age, drugs and malnutrition, as well as infections. Intensive investigation of enteric infections in the past three decades has resulted in the discovery of many new viral agents filling in the 'diagnostic gap' in diarrheal disease. With the identification of the Norwalk virus, rotavirus, astroviruses, enteric adenoviruses and other caliciviruses in the 1970s and subsequently, it has become increasingly clear that viruses cause a significant proportion of the enteric illnesses that did not earlier have a defined etiology. With improvements in sanitation and hygiene, and better standards of living, the proportion of diarrheal disease attributed to bacteria has decreased, resulting in an increase in the proportion of cases associated with viral infections. Developments of new assays to identify viruses have also resulted in the ability to identify the viral etiology of episodes and epidemics of gastroenteritis (Desselberger and Gray, 2003) .",

Protection in early infancy is believed to be mediated by maternal antibodies, followed by acquisition of protective immunity through repeated exposure in early childhood. This pattern is seen with all viral enteropathogens. However, for the noroviruses and astroviruses, immunity is not long-lasting, suggesting waning of immunity or lack of cross-protection between different viral strains. Childhood diarrhea is best exemplified by the group A rotaviruses, but a similar pattern of infection and illness is seen with enteric adenoviruses, astroviruses and sapoviruses. These agents infect children during the first few years of life, with first infections being symptomatic and protecting against subsequent disease. Disease is caused by a limited number of specific serotypes and incidence decreases with increasing age.",

In other parts of the world, approximately 40-45% of gastroenteritis requiring admission is due to rotavirus. Of the 'non-group A' rotaviruses, group B rotavirus has been identified in epidemic outbreaks of severe diarrhea in adults in China and in symptomatic infections in children. Outbreaks of diarrhea due to group C rotavirus have been identified in Asia, Europe, South, and North America, but are not common. Human noroviruses are associated mainly with milder cases of gastroenteritis in children, causing >20% of diarrheal disease in children in the community. After introduction of rotavirus vaccines, noroviruses have become the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children (Koo et al., 2013) . Enteric adenoviruses cause 10% of diarrheal disease in reports from developed countries and have a variable incidence of 2-30% depending on the region in developing countries. Astroviruses were found in approximately 1% of cases, when electron microscopy was employed for detection, but with the availability of a commercial enzyme immunoassay and molecular techniques, the percentage of detection has increased in hospital and community settings to 5-10%, and several new types of astroviruses have recently been described.",

Noroviruses, transmitted by the fecal-oral and the aerosol route, are the most common cause of outbreaks of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in industrialized countries, and emerging data indicates that they are also prevalent in developing countries. Many outbreaks can be associated with the consumption of primarily or secondarily contaminated foods. Shellfish and fruit implicated in outbreaks have been shown to be contaminated at the site where these foods are harvested or produced, whereas other foods, such as salads, cold foods, and sandwiches, have caused outbreaks after being contaminated by food handlers at the site of food preparation. Shellfish, in particular, oysters and clams, which are raw or insufficiently cooked, are associated with noroviral outbreaks, frequently occurring because these shellfish filter contaminated seawater to feed and hence result in a concentration of virus. Foodborne outbreaks due to rotaviruses, parvoviruses, and astroviruses are also occasionally reported. Water is also a common source of outbreaks and may include water from municipal supplies, wells, recreational lakes, swimming pools, and ice machines. Rotaviruses, noroviruses and some adenoviruses are important causes of waterborne disease outbreaks. Post-recovery and secondary transmission is a particular concern in infections due to these agents (Kapikian, 1994) .",

So far, these include human caliciviruses, which are noroviruses and sapoviruses, rotaviruses, astroviruses and the enteric adenoviruses. In immunocompromised patients, gastrointestinal CMV and EBV infections also cause significant morbidity. Coronaviruses, including the SARS coronavirus, toroviruses, the Aichivirus, certain non-polio enteroviruses and picobirnaviruses have also been found to be associated with diarrhea. Similarly, in conditions such as HIV, it has been difficult to obtain definitive data on the role of enteric viruses in the causation of symptoms (Thomas et al., 1999) . The study of rotaviruses, enteric adenoviruses, and astroviruses has been facilitated greatly by the ability to propagate these viruses in cell culture, which has allowed the production of reagents for use in diagnostic studies, a better understanding of factors correlated with immunity to infection, and the elucidation of each virus's life cycle. Although human noroviruses have defied numerous attempts to propagate them in cell culture to date, the ability to culture murine norovirus has informed pathogenesis and the use of molecular tools has increased our ability to diagnose and study norovirus infections ( Figure 1 ).",

The mature virus particles are triple layered, approximately 70 nm in diameter, and possess icosahedral symmetry. The rotavirus genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA that code for 6 structural viral proteins and 6 non-structural proteins. Of the non-structural proteins, NSP4 is of particular interest, since it has enterotoxin-like activity and can induce diarrhea in mice. The classification of rotavirus into 7 different groups (A-G) is based on the antigenic specificity of the VP6 capsid proteins. Of the 7 groups, only groups A, B and C are known to infect humans. Severe, life-threatening disease in children worldwide is caused predominantly by group A rotaviruses. Variability in the genes encoding the two outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4 form the basis of the current strain typing of group A rotaviruses into G and P genotypes respectively. All known G serotypes correspond with genotypes; more P genotypes than serotypes have been identified. At least 15 G genotypes and >30 P genotypes have been identified to date. The strains most commonly reported include G1P , and more recently G12 strains in combination with different P types. Unusual G and P types have been reported from different parts of the world. The temporal changes in circulating strains and the rapid evolution of rotaviruses by a variety of mechanisms provide challenges in epidemiological studies. These mechanisms of evolution include genetic drift, wherein accumulation of point mutations generates genetic lineages leading to the emergence of antibody escape mutants, and genetic shift through gene reassortment during dual infection of a single cell. Hence methods of virus typing need to be regularly monitored and updated to identify emerging novel strains of epidemiological importance (Parashar et al., 2013) .",

It was believed that the antibody response in primary infection was homotypic with subsequent infections producing a broadening of the immune response, but the basis of strain-specific immunity is less clear now that it has been shown that two doses of a monovalent vaccine can present infection with multiple strains as well as a multivalent vaccine (Parashar et al., 2013) .",

These cup-like depressions are more prominent in some strains, particularly the sapoviruses, leading to the characteristic Star of David appearance from which caliciviruses get their name. Caliciviruses (family Caliciviridae) are a group of nonenveloped, icosahedral viruses with a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome. The genome is 7.5-7.7 kb in length and has three open reading frames (ORFs). Noroviruses can be genetically classified into six different genogroups (GI-GVI) which can be further divided into different genetic groups or genotypes. Genogroups I, II and IV infect humans, while genogroup III is associated with bovine infections and genogroup V has been isolated in mice. Noroviruses were initially named after the places where the outbreaks occurred, but a numeric classification system based upon numbering genogroups with Roman numerals and genotypes with numbers is now used. For example the genogroup II norovirus, Lordsdale virus is a member of genotype 4, and therefore classified as a GII.4 norovirus. GII.4 viruses account for the majority of adult outbreaks of gastroenteritis and often sweep across the globe, with the Sydney 2012 virus the most recent GII.4 to cause multi-country outbreaks (Ramani et al., 2014) . Sapoviruses, previously called the classical caliciviruses based on their morphology, have a similar system of strain designation as noroviruses and have 8 human genotypes in 5 genogroups, although up to 14 genogroups have been proposed with the inclusion of sapoviruses from other hosts (Scheuer et al., 2013) .",

Late sequelae have not been reported, but the elderly often report persistence of constitutional symptoms for up to several weeks. Routes of transmission that have been documented include water, food (particularly shellfish and salads), aerosol, fomites, and person-to-person contact.

The epithelial cells remain intact with a shortening of the microvilli. The mechanism by which diarrhea is produced is unknown. In volunteer studies, infection by the Norwalk virus induces a specific IgG, IgA and IgM serum antibody response, even in persons with pre-existing antibodies. After norovirus infection, immunity appears to last for a few months but there is little or no evidence of long-term protection. Volunteer studies conducted in the 1970s also suggested that some people were resistant to Norwalk virus challenge. Human Blood Group Antigens (HBGAs) have been shown to serve as cell attachment factors for noroviruses and thus determine susceptibility to certain human noroviruses. Reduced infection and illness is observed in persons with serum antibodies that block strain-specific binding to HBGAs HBGA expression on cell surfaces is affected by the ABO, Secretor and Lewis genotypes of an individual. In general, because GII.4 viruses can bind a larger range of HBGAs in comparison to other genotypes, they have a larger susceptible population pool for infection (Ramani et al., 2014) .

The first vaccine developed was the tetravalent human-rhesus reassortant vaccine, which induces protection against the four main rotavirus serotypes, G1-G4. Efficacy studies showed a reduction in the appearance of severe gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus in vaccinated children, and the vaccine was approved in the USA in 1998. However, the detection of an increase in the risk of intussusception after vaccination led to its suspension. In 2006, two new licensed vaccines became commercially available. These were Rotateq\u00d4, a live oral attenuated pentavalent vaccine from Merck which is recommended by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to be given at 2, 4 and 6 months with the last dose administered no later than 32 weeks, and Rotarix\u00d4 from GlaxoSmithKline, a human strain derived monovalent live oral vaccine given in two doses at 2 and 4 months. Both vaccines are licensed and used in over one hundred countries and the number continues to grow. The vaccines have lower efficacy in low and middle-income countries than in more industrialized countries. Nonetheless, use of the vaccine has shown a dramatic effect on diarrheal hospitalizations in countries where the vaccines are widely used and a reduction in all cause diarrheal mortality in middle-income countries. A lower level of risk of intussusception of about one case in 20 000-50 000 vaccines has been identified in several countries with both vaccines, but overall, the benefits and lives saved by the vaccine are much greater than the risk and sequelae of intussusception (Parashar et al., 2013) . Owing to the high cost of these vaccines, vaccine manufacturers in developing countries have initiated the process of formulating and testing vaccines based on local strains which will address the issue of cost. DNA based, subunit protein based and virus like particle vaccines may also provide an alternate method of prevention in the future.",
