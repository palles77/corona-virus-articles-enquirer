Biocidal properties should be a necessary feature for medicaluse textiles. Biocidal functions, different from biostatic functions, include sterilization, disinfection, and sanitization in an order of the strength. According to guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), medical use biocidal functions should be at least at the disinfection level, which can inactivate most infectious microorganisms. In addition, biocidal functions on textile materials should survive repeated laundering if used as uniforms, linens and even reusable surgical scraps and gowns. Among the currently investigated antimicrobial materials, only Nhalamines have shown the capability of providing fast and total kill against a wide range of microorganisms without causing resistance from microorganisms. Furthermore, halamine structures can be recharged by chlorine bleaching, a process recommended by CD as well. Thus, biocidal textiles containing the halamine structures have been developed. Recent studies in biocidal polymers have resulted interesting progresses in incorporating halamines to all synthetic fabrics that are widely used as medical and other professional clothing materials. Chemistry and properties of the new processes have been discussed in this presentation.",

Medical protective gear for doctors and nurses including gowns, masks, and gloves are currently serving as barriers to the diseases and are insufficient in preventing the transmissions of the diseases. Recent outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) have further indicated that the barrier materials may not be able to provide sufficient protections against this disease since a large number of SARS patients are healthcare workers. In addition, researchers have revealed that textiles are good media for hosting microorganisms and therefore, are potentially responsible for the disease transmission 3. Moreover, spreading of multi drug-resistant bacteria in healthcare facilities is threatening not only safety of healthcare workers but also publics. One drug-resistant microorganism, mecicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was found not only existing but also surviving for a long period of time on all of textile materials in hospital environment 3-5. No doubts, textile materials are responsible for disease transmission and spreading of the new strains of the diseases from the main sources to elsewhere 3. On the other side, textile materials, as necessary materials for clothing and daily life, are possible means for prevention of infectious diseases and pathogens, if they become antimicrobial. Thus, the research and development of antimicrobial textiles, particularly the medical textiles for healthcare providers and patients are important and necessary.",

The biocidal materials are able to kill and eliminate the growth of microorganisms, and can therefore protect wearers of the textiles from biological attacks. Biocidal functions are completely different from biostatic functions that only inhibit the growth of microorganisms on textiles. Biostatic functions are usually employed in preservation of textile arts in museum or odor-control of the materials, but cannot prevent transmission of diseases due to the limitation of functions.",

In addition, the recharging agents should be nontoxic, available at home, and compatible with our laundering chemicals such as detergents or bleaching agents. Antimicrobial textile material was first developed in 1867 by Lister who demonstrated the relationship between fibrous materials and diseases 6. Since then, many innovative antimicrobial materials have been developed 7\u00b7 ",

Although the model was presented over thirty years ago, there has been little reported success in textiles until recently. However, this principle has provided an important approach in the design of this innovative functional finishing. Antimicrobial functions on textiles, different from other functional finishes on textiles, normally consume biocidal agents incorporated into fibres. Therefore, to achieve durable and rechargeable antimicrobial functions reversible reactions and house-hold recharging agents were considered in this research.",

            "text": "Chlorine bleach is a registered biocide and has been used as a disinfectant for decades without any reported resistance generated from any microorganisms. But, it is quite corrosive and toxic, particularly with concerns of producing carcinogens (such as HCCl) in water. However, some of chlorine derivatives, i.e. halamine compounds, though possessing similar biocidal properties as chlorine, are more environmentally friendly and thus widely used in swimming pools and even drinking water disinfection 12-13 Halamines inactivate microorganisms by oxidation mechanisms rather than biological functions, and wide usage of them could result in less concern on drugresistance of diseases. If the halamine compounds can be covalently connected to polymers, a reversible redox reaction can then be implemented on solid materials. The design of modification of textiles, activation or regeneration of hal amine structures, and inactivation of microorganisms is expressed by a regeneration principle (Fig. 1) 14-15. According to the mechanism of the biocidal function and regeneration process, diluted chlorine bleach solutions serve as both activation and regeneration agents of the biocidal functions. By using the chlorine bleaching process, the potential biocidal groups grafted on cellulose, i.e. amide or imide N-H bonds in hydantoin rings, will be converted to biocidal halamine structures, meanwhile the textiles materials are sterilised. It provides a convenient way for activation and regeneration of biocidal functions, and is the best fit for medical use textiles since they are commercially laundered with chlorine bleach. Many of these halamine structures have been reviewed and investigated for water disinfection purposes 12. Monomethylol or dimethylol derivatives of 5,5-dimethyl hydantoin were first employed in grafting the heterocyclic ring to cellulose 14-15. When chlorine atom replaces hydrogen on N-H bond, the N-Cl bond is formed and stabilised by the vicinal carbonyl groups on the grafted dimethyl hydantoin ring (Fig. 2) . The stability of N-CI bonds on halamines contributes to the durability and stability of antimicrobial properties on chlorinated fabrics, with evidence that the bleached fabrics could retain the antimicrobial properties for more than six months in conditioning room (at 21'C and 65% relative humidity). After each laundering, the fabrics treated with dimethylol-5,5dimethylhydantoin (DMDMH) or monomethylo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (MDMH) could be recharged by chlorine bleaching because of presence of predominant imide N-Cl bonds that can be washed offby detergents (reverse reaction in Fig. 1 ). The antibacterial properties of the finished fabrics were evaluated with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungus, yeasts, and viruses following AA TCC standard test method 100. These microorganisms represent a whole spectrum of pathogens that healthcare providers are encountering every day. Based on characteristics of medical protection requirements, contact time of microorganisms on surfaces of fabrics was chosen at two minutes, which was the shortest interval when a microbiological test can be managed properly. Two commonly used fabrics, pure cotton and polyester/cotton sheets, were treated by finishing solutions containing 2% and 6% of dimethylol dimethylhydantoin (DMDMH), respectively, and bleached subsequently in a diluted chlorine solution. The results, listed in Table 1 , are reported in log reductions of microorganisms, with one log reduction referring to 90% kill and three log reduction meaning 99.9% kill. Comparing to other antimicrobial textiles, the new biocidal fabrics exhibited superior properties as textile materials for medical workers and patients, owing to their rapid and effective inactivation of a broad range of microorganisms. In addition, the outstanding biocidal properties of the fabrics are durable and regenerable by chlorine bleaching, a process commonly used in commercial laundering of institutional textiles. The antimicrobial properties of the fabrics could be recharged after repeated laundering by the bleaching. Apparently, active chlorine in halamines could be affected by laundering detergents. Thus, after each laundry the fabrics are recommended be bleached to refresh the lost antimicrobial functions. Chlorine bleaching is a required process for used medical textiles, and using it in medical textiles is compatible with the existing operation. More recently, durable and regenerable antimicrobial fabrics that can survive more than 50 machine washes without recharging have been developed by using the same chemistry.",

Fig 4 (a) and (b) show grafting add-on of monomers under different temperature on several fabrics. ADMH grafted fabrics could provide similar halamine structures to the grafted fabrics, and result in desired antimicrobial functions (Tables 2 and 3 ). The functions can be recharged in chlorine bleaching. In fact, after 50 washes all fabrics could still regain their biocidal properties easily. Due to hydrophobicity of several polymers, the active halamine structures could not be washed off easily. Table 4 shows antimicrobial results of Nomex fabrics after repeated washing and recharge. The antimicrobial properties on the Nomex fabric survived fifteen times laundry with minimal reduction of efficacy. After 50 washes, a chlorine recharge can almost completely restore the lost chlorine on the fabric.",
