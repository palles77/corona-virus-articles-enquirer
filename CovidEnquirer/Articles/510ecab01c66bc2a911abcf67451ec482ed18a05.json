The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality.",

As Chongqing is reported to be one of the major cities imported passengers from Wuhan in China from December 16, 2019 9 . Given the regional disparity of COVID-19, we aim to describe epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients in Chongqing municipality, and compare the differences between non-severe and severe patients, which may unravel risk factors associated with 28-day mortality and further suggest a specific therapeutic intervention for patients with COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality, China.",

There is only one critically severe patient who received 120mg methylprednisolone. A total of 35 patients (70.0%) received immunopotentiators (thymalfasin 1.6mg/day) or immunoglobulin treatments and 13 severe patients (26.0%) received vasopressors for shock rescue.Few non-severe patients received ordinary oxygen therapy, delivered by nasal cannula or face mask at 1-4 liters per minute (41, 18.9%). Oxygen therapy including invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). It is worth noting that 3 critically severe patients received invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, and the oxygenation improved remarkably. Moreover, traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0%). Currently, none of patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, kidney replacement therapy or convalescent plasma therapy. However, 3 critically severe patients are going to receive ECMO after professional assessment. And, two discharged COVID-19 patients promised to donate convalescent plasma for critically severe patients' further treatment. As compared with non-severe cases, severe cases suffered higher rates of any complications (27[54.0%] vs 8[3.7%]) during hospital admission. The most common complicationswere ARDS (33, 12.4%), secondary to shock (13, 4.9%) and acute cardiac injury (3, 1.1%), especially more common for severe patients (ARDS, 54.0%; septic shock, 22.0%; acute cardiac injury, 6.0%). Notably, in our study, all of the critically severe cases are complicated with ARDS of different severity, and 4 death cases died of severe ARDS.",
