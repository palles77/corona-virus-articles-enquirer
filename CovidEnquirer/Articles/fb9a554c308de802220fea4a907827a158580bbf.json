This report addresses methods and strategies identified by workshop participants for replacement of animals used for potency testing of human vaccines. Vaccines considered to have the highest priority for future efforts were (1) vaccines for which antigen quantification methods are already developed but not validated, (2) vaccines/components that require the largest number of animals, (3) vaccines that require an in vivo challenge test, and (4) vaccines with in vivo tests that are highly variable and cause a significant number of invalid tests. Vaccine potency tests identified as the highest priorities for replacement were those for diphtheria and tetanus, pertussis (whole cell and acellular), rabies, anthrax, polio vaccine (inactivated) and complex combination vaccines based on DT or DTwP/aP. Research into understanding the precise mechanism of protection afforded by vaccines and the identification of clinically relevant immunological markers are needed to facilitate the successful implementation of in vitro testing alternatives. This report also identifies several priority human vaccines and associated research objectives that are necessary to successfully implement in vitro vaccine potency testing alternatives.",

Authorities emphasized that, following the regulatory approval of a vaccine, testing is required to ensure that each subsequent production lot is pure, safe, and sufficiently potent to generate a protective immune response in people or animals [11, 12] .",

These include hepatitis A/B vaccines, inactivated polio vaccine, polysaccharide and polysaccharide conjugate vaccines, and human papillomavirus vaccine ( Table 2) . For the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, two types of in vitro immunoassays have been developed as alternatives to the mouse immunogenicity test. The first is based on the direct determination of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), while the other is based on the neutralization of HbsAg and subsequent detection of remaining anti-HbsAg antibodies in an ELISA [35, 49, 50] . Perhaps the most critical need for a valid alternative for potency testing is in the area of rabies vaccines. The traditional method for inactivated rabies vaccine potency testing is a multiple-dilution vaccination challenge test in mice. This test, commonly referred to as the NIH test, because of the origin of its development (the National Institutes of Health), is based on the relative proportion of animals protected from rabies in groups receiving the test vaccine compared to those immunized with a reference vaccine. The need for an alternative test is critical because the traditional potency test requires large numbers of animals that experience unrelieved pain and distress. Approximately half of the test animals die or develop acute signs of rabies (e.g., convulsions, paresis, paralysis). The inherent variability of this assay contributes to a high number of invalid assays, which leads to further use of animals for repeat testing [59] . The potential exposure of laboratory technicians to biohazardous materials during testing is also an important consideration.",

Several types of in vitro ELISA procedures for rabies vaccines have been developed during the past few years, taking advantage of advances in defining the neutralizing epitopes [59, 60, 61] . While these assays would confer distinct advantages over in vivo test methods (e.g., no animals required, faster, less costly), limitations that have impeded their development and implementation include the following: (1) they are not universally applicable to all vaccine strains, (2) they cannot be used in combination with adjuvants, and (3) they do not correlate well with the in vivo challenge test [35, 59] . Clear correlations have yet to be demonstrated among the amount of antigen required to induce a protective immune response in animals, the amount of antigen measured using alternative in vitro assays, and the immune response in human vaccines [19] . Therefore, it is difficult to correlate potency defined by protection in animals versus potency defined by alternative methods [19, 35] . However, further studies targeted toward the potential usefulness of ELISA procedures for rabies vaccine potency testing are ongoing [19] . These initiatives represent critical first steps toward developing a scientifically valid alternative replacement method for potency testing of rabies vaccines. It is of note that the European Pharmacopoeia has now issued a draft proposal for comments for the use of antibody quantification for lot release of rabies vaccines for veterinary use, subject to product-specific validation [62] .",

A thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of an infectious disease and associated protective mechanisms is necessary to accurately identify the specific antigen or key epitope responsible for eliciting a protective immune response. Once a clinically relevant antigen/epitope is identified, further studies are required to fully understand its role in protection and how the antigen in the vaccine may be affected by the vaccine manufacturing process (e.g., epitope modification due to detoxification and absorption to adjuvant) and how this process may alter how the vaccine is presented to the immune system and how it is processed in the target species.

However, the amount of antigen detected using an in vitro method and the biological activity (in vivo potency) may depend on additional factors: for example, in certain combination vaccines containing tetanus toxoid as an active ingredient and Hib polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid (e.g. DTwP + Hib-TT [63] and an experimental DTaP-IPV + Hib-vaccine [64] ) tetanus potency measured using the in vivo method was increased relative to the potency of a vaccine which did not contain the Hib-TT component due to the presence of the carrier protein. In such cases the amount of tetanus toxoid detected by an in vitro binding assay may not be different because the in vitro assay cannot detect the conjugated tetanus toxoid [62] .

Use of adjuvants may also result in significantly lower antigen content in veterinary vaccines compared to that present in nonadjuvanted human vaccines. Veterinary vaccines are often not as well characterized as the corresponding human vaccines and are typically composed of complex mixtures that include antigens derived from the whole cell, cell lysates, or cell culture supernatants.

One suggestion was to develop an interagency task force to deal with specific issues relevant to both human and veterinary medicine. For example, the increased complexity of adjuvants in certain veterinary vaccines has resulted in a better understanding of adjuvant/antigen interactions, which may be useful to human vaccine manufacturers as additional adjuvants are considered for approval in their products. Conversely, antigen quantification methods that are currently available for human rabies vaccines for inprocess control (WHO technical guidelines) may be useful to veterinary rabies vaccine manufacturers.

Workshop participants also recognized the importance of standardizing lot-release criteria and encouraging mutual recognition of test results among regulatory authorities. This would avoid duplicative testing that results in more animals being used and extends the time before products can be released to the public. Participants also recognized the need for stepwise advancement in which specific vaccines are prioritized and administrative procedures, such as a reduction in the frequency of official control testing, may precede technical strategies based on refinement and replacement alternatives. Incentives by regulatory authorities to encourage the implementation of new validated 3Rs approaches for potency testing of human vaccines were also viewed as important considerations.

Several other recent symposia have sought to further the science of the 3Rs as they apply to the use of animals for quality control of biologicals. These symposia addressed various aspects of promoting and facilitating the use of non-animal methods for the quality control of either human or veterinary biologicals, as well as increasing the understanding and implementation of the consistency approach to the manufacturing of human and veterinary biologics. Several workshops have been convened over the past several years that were all dedicated to finding new ways to advance the development and implementation of alternative methods for the quality control of human or veterinary biologicals [110, 111, 112] .",
