            "text": "The 'infectious DNA' approach, which is based on in vivo transcription of ( +)RNA virus genome cDNA cassettes from eukaryotic promoters in transfected cells, became a popular alternative to the classical scheme in the infectious clone methodology. Its use, however, is often limited by the instability of plasmids due to a transcriptional activity of eukaryotic promoters in Escherichia coli resulting in synthesis of products toxic for the bacterial host. Using a highly unstable representative infectious clone of Japanese encephalitis (JE) flavivirus, we tested a new approach in design of such problematic 'infectious DNA' constructs, which is based on minimizing unwanted transcription in the bacterial host. A plasmid containing full genome size JE cDNA under control of the minimal cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter can be propagated in E. coli with growth and stability characteristics similar to that of constructs controlled by the T7 promoter. Transfection of this plasmid into susceptible cells leads to the establishment of a productive infectious cycle. Reinsertion of the CMV enhancer at the 3%-end of the JE cassette substantially increased the specific infectivity without affecting the stability and growth characteristics of the construct. This approach can be useful when stabilization of infectious clones by modification of a viral cDNA cassette is not the feasible or suitable alternative.",

            "text": "Modern (+)RNA virus studies increasingly rely on the infectious clone methodology (reviewed, Boyer and Haenni, 1994) , which allows targeted manipulation of viral genomes. In the classical approach, (+ )RNA viruses are recov-ered from cells transfected with synthetic RNA made by in vitro transcription of infectious clone cDNA templates (Campbell and Pletnev, 2000; Gritsun and Gould, 1995; Kapoor et al., 1995; Polo et al., 1997; Rice et al., 1989; Sumiyoshi et al., 1992) . In a layered DNA/RNA approach, also known as 'infectious DNA' (Herweijer et al., 1995) , (+ )RNA viruses are recovered directly after transfection of plasmids carrying viral genome cDNA into susceptible cells. It was first reported for poliovirus (Racaniello and Balti-more, 1981) , and has been widely used for plant viruses (reviewed, Boyer and Haenni, 1994) . Recently, it was adapted for alphaviruses (reviewed, Schlesinger and Dubensky, 1999) . Substantial difficulties, however, were encountered in design of flavivirus 'infectious DNA', requiring either modification of the viral genome cassette (Yamshchikov et al., 2001) to prevent unwanted expression of viral genome segments encoding toxic for Escherichia coli products, or deletion of the structural protein region (Varnavski et al., 2000) . Substantial stabilization of viral genome cassettes by blocking unwanted expression was also reported for a number of plant viruses (Johansen, 1996; Lopez-Moya and Garcia, 2000; Olsen and Johansen, 2001) . In this approach, deleterious effects of spurious transcription from eukaryotic promoters in bacterial cells are eliminated at the translational level by insertion of intron(s) into viral cDNA cassettes. There may be situations, however, when such modification of a viral cassette is not feasible or is not acceptable. For this reason we sought to investigate if the stability of constructs containing an unmodified virus genome cassette can be improved by preventing its deleterious expression at the transcriptional level, i.e. by minimizing spurious transcription from eukaryotic promoters in E. coli.",

            "text": "As a model, we have used a highly unstable infectious clone of Japanese encephalitis flavivirus (JE) (Sumiyoshi et al., 1992; Yamshchikov et al., 2001) . JE is a member of the Fla6i6irus genus of the family Fla6i6iridae, which also includes yellow fever (YF), West Nile, tick borne encephalitis, dengue, and hepatitis C viruses (Kuno et al., 1998) . The flavivirus virion contains singlestranded RNA of positive polarity, which is approximately 11 kb in length and encodes three structural and seven nonstructural proteins (Rice, 1996) . Viral RNA is capped at its 5%-end, but has no poly(A) tract at the 3%-end. Both virion RNA and in vitro synthesized capped RNA are infectious when transfected into susceptible cells (Rice et al., 1989) . In this report we demonstrate that spurious transcription in E. coli can be substantially reduced by utilizing a minimal eukaryotic promoter (Davis and Huang, 1988) to control transcription of the viral cassette. As an enhancement of this 'minimal approach', a substantial increase in the specific infectivity of 'infectious DNA' was achieved by placing the enhancer at the 3%-end of the viral genome cassette. While this methodology does not resolve completely the instability problem, it may be considered as an alternative approach when for any reason the viral genome cassette cannot be modified.",

This suggests that spurious transcription from eukaryotic promoters in E. coli (Antonucci et al., 1989; Davis and Huang, 1988) may substantially contribute to the observed instability of such constructs. As an alternative to the mentioned above modification of viral genome cassettes, we sought to explore if a decrease of such spurious transcription can eliminate the destabilizing effect of eukaryotic promoters on 'infectious DNA' constructs. The powerful and versatile CMV promoter, often used to drive expression of engineered constructs in a variety of mammalian cells (Foecking and Hofstetter, 1986) , consists of a transcriptionally active minimal promoter region of approximately 100 bp immediately adjacent to the RNA transcription start, and of an about 600 bp upstream enhancer element, which displays only a minute transcriptional activity in mammalian cells (Thomsen et al., 1984) . To determine if the enhancer has any effect on the promoter activity in E. coli, we designed plasmids pBR/luc (no promoter), pCMV/luc (full promoter), pCMVmp/luc (no enhancer), and a pair of plasmids pCMVmp/luc-enhD and pCMVmp/luc-enhR containing the enhancer relocated to the end of the reporter gene (Fig. 1A) . Comparative evaluation of luciferase production in E. coli transformed with the above plasmids, shown in Fig. 1B , indicated that deletion of the enhancer leads to a 5-6-fold reduction of luciferase gene expression. In contrast to position-independent function of enhancers in mammalian cells (Jonsson et al., 1994) , and certain activators in prokaryotic cells (Molina-Lopez and Santero, 1999) , the CMV enhancer relocated downstream from the reporter gene had no dis-cernible effect on production of luciferase in E. coli.",

Since an enhancing effect of flavivirus 5%-UTR on translation would be beneficial in the devised 'minimal' approach, we were interested to determine if such enhancing effect can be observed with JE 5%-UTR in vivo. To address this question, we designed plasmids pCMV5%UTR-JE/luc and pCMVmp5%UTR-JE/luc (Fig. 1A) , in which the first 69 nucleotides of JE 5%-UTR have been placed between the luciferase reporter gene and the CMV or minimal CMV promoters, respectively. The effect of 5%-UTR was accessed by measuring luciferase activity in lysates of BHK cells transiently transfected with these plasmids and with plasmids pCMV/luc and pCMVmp/luc (Fig. 1A) . Surprisingly, luciferase production from pCMV5%UTR-JE/luc was about 15-20% less than from pCMV/luc, and the presence of JE 5%-UTR had no discernible effect on amounts of luciferase produced from the construct containing the minimal CMV promoter (Fig. 1C) .

            "text": "Based on the evidence described above, we attempted to assemble an 'infectious DNA' of Japanese encephalitis flavivirus under control of the minimal CMV promoter. Sequence analysis of one isolate of the pCMVJE5%(943) plasmid described earlier (Yamshchikov et al., 2001 ) revealed a silent substitution at pos. 551 of the JE cDNA fragment resulting in formation of an additional site for restriction endonuclease Sau3A I (GATT GATC). This mutation has created a convenient marker allowing to distinguish between genomes of the parent and recovered viruses. In contrast to the similar construct controlled by the full CMV promoter (Yamshchikov et al., 2001) , a pCMVmpJE5% plasmid containing 5%-half (1-5576 nt) of the JE genome cDNA controlled by the minimal promoter appeared stable with growth characteristics in E. coli HB101 resembling those of pT7JE5% (Sumiyoshi et al., 1992; Yamshchikov et al., 2001) . Preservation of the open reading frame in the JE fragment was confirmed by its complete sequencing. Similarly, pCMVmpJE(-BGHTT) containing full-length JE genome cDNA and the BGH transcriptional terminator (Fig. 2) had the same growth characteristics in E.coli HB101 as the half JE genome-containing plasmid pCMVmpJE5%. To evaluate the stability of the final construct during propagation in E.coli HB101, three independent isolates of pCMVmpJE(BGHTT) were subjected to two transformation-plasmid isolation cycles. Plasmid transformation usually resulted in formation of small uniform colonies, with large colonies observed with a frequency of less than 10 \u2212 3 . Plasmid DNA isolated from small colonies was infectious and had the similar specific infectivity in BHK cells. Plasmids isolated from the large colonies were not infectious and had substantial rearrangements in the viral cDNA cassette. Finally, we have reinserted the enhancer fragment into pCMVmpJE(BGHTT) downstream from the BGHTT fragment. In agreement with the evidence described above, resulting plasmids pCMVmpJE(BGHTT)enhD and pCMVmpJE(-BGHTT)enhR had the same stability and growth characteristics as the parent plasmid.",

The specific infectivity of plasmid pCMVmpJE(BGHTT) appeared dependent on a transfection agent and transfection protocol used, and was in the range of 10 2 -10 3.5 pfu/mg. The presence of the CMV enhancer downstream from BGHTT led to an increase in the specific infectivity to 1-5 \u00d7 10 5 pfu/mg, which became comparable to that of the full CMV-controlled intron-containing construct pCMVp/ eJE(i356i2217)BGHTT reported earlier (Yamshchikov et al., 2001) Cytopathic effects resembling those resulting from infection of BHK cells with the parent strain JaOArS982 were reproducibly observed 3-4 days after exposure of BHK monolayers to DNase treated media from cells transfected with pCMVm-pJE(BGHTT), indicating the presence of a DNaseinsensitive infectious agent. The time course of virus accumulation in the media was determined at 12-h intervals after transfection of BHK cells with 1 mg of the plasmid pCMVmpJE(BGHTT).

The virus recovered from DNA had the same growth characteristics in BHK cells as the parent JaOArS982 virus, with titers reaching 10 6.0 -6.5 pfu/ml, and producing plaques on monolayers of BHK cells similar by the size and morphology to plaques produced by the parent virus (Fig. 4) .

Indeed, replacement of the T7 promoter in pT7JE/Kpn infectious clone (Yamshchikov et al., 2001) with the minimal CMV promoter did not result in destabilization of the plasmid or in change of its growth characteristics. This suggests that in E. coli a substantial part of the spurious transcriptional activity was associated with the enhancer, since its exclusion enabled us to obtain a construct reasonably stable in E. coli with the frequency of stabilizing mutations less than 10 \u2212 3 . Using indirect immunofluorescence, we detected synthesis of virus-specific proteins in cells transfected with the full genome constructs; however we did not detect virus-specific proteins when cells were transfected with the half-genome construct pCMVmpJE5%. This is probably indicative of a low transport rate through nuclear membrane of non-polyadenylated RNA or/and a low transcription rate from the minimal promoter in vivo, which may also explain the substantially lower specific infectivity of the DNA construct driven by such promoter.",

            "text": "Certain regulatory elements of the eukaryotic genes, such as enhancers, can influence gene expression in position-and orientation-independent manner (Jonsson et al., 1994) . We reasoned that such capability would be beneficial in our system, since we could increase transcription rate in mammalian cells without affecting the stability of constructs in E. coli. Indeed, plasmids containing the luciferase reporter gene under control of the minimal CMV promoter and the enhancer inserted at the end of the gene directed increased production of luciferase in BHK cells, i.e. only 40-50% of that directed by the full promoter, and expression levels did not depend on the enhancer orientation. In contrast, no effect on luciferase production was observed in E. coli transformed with these plasmids. Similarly, insertion of the CMV enhancer into pCMVmpJE(BGHTT) after the polyadenylation signal resulted in a 10-100-fold increase in the specific infectivity as compared to the parent plasmid. In our hands, the specific infectivity of the designed DNA construct reached 5\u00d7 10 5 pfu/mg and became comparable to the specific infectivity of the intron-stabilized plasmid (10 6 pfu/mg; Yamshchikov et al., 2001 ). Yet, no substantial difference in the stability or in the growth characteristics of the resulting plasmid has been observed in E. coli.",

While this approach cannot resolve instability problems associated with the presence in viral genome cDNA prokaryotic promoter-like elements (Johansen, 1996; Lopez-Moya and Garcia, 2000; Olsen and Johansen, 2001) , it simplifies design of 'infectious DNA' constructs, in which spurious transcription from an eukaryotic promoter fragment does serve as the major destabilizing factor. Together with the intron-based stabilization approach, it provides a certain flexibility and a choice in the design strategy. The availability of more convenient flavivirus 'infectious DNA' should facilitate advances in studies on mechanisms of flavivirus replication and in design of novel flavivirus vaccines.",
