Analysis by hybridization kinetics of the annealing between A59 [S2P]cDNA and infected cell RNA from the other four MHV strains demonstrated 7040% homology. By gel transfer analysis, the A59 [S2P]eDNA was able to detect subgenomic-size virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with all of the five MHV strains. A similar pattern of seven viral RNAs was detected in cells infected with A59, MHV-1, MHV-3, and JHM. In contrast, cells infected with MHV-S contained seven virusspecific RNAs, of which only the two smallest species comigrated with RNAs from the other four strains. The results suggest that as previously shown with A59 (S. Cheley, R. Anderson, M. J. Cupples, E. C. M. Lee Chan, and V. L. Morris (1981) Virdogy, 112,596-604), all MHV strains tested encode a nested set of subgenomic RNAs. Analysis of [?l]methionine-labeled viral proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide",

A majority of the chymotryptic peptides from each of the [35S$nethioninelabeled N proteins was found to coelute by high-performance liquid chromatography. Moreover, this technique of peptide mapping indicated a particularly strong relatedness between MHV-1 and MHV-S and among MHV3, JHM, and A59.",

Among the coronaviruses pathogenic for rodents, murine hepatitis viruses (MHV) have received considerable attention. Several distinct serotypes of MHV have been recognized (Hierholzer et aL, 19'79; Piazza, 1969) and numerous studies have centered on the pathological effects of MHV infection of mice and rats. Of particular interest is the JHM strain which, unlike other r To whom reprint requests should be sent. MHV strains, shows only a moderate propensity toward visceral tissue, instead, producing a selective infection of the nervous system Cheever et ah, 1949; Weiner, 1973; Lucas et aL, 1977) . Neurological infections by JHM virus can, in some cases, be of a selectively demyelinating nature (Haspel et aL, 1978; Nagashima et aL, 1978; Sorensen et aL, 1980; Weiner, 1973) ; this feature has prompted analogies between JHM disease and human demyelinating conditions of suspected viral etiology . Other strains of MHV produce varying degrees of hepatic disease (Dick et al, 1956; Gledhill and Andrewes, 1951; Manaker et ak, 1961; Nelson, 1952; Rowe et aL, 1963) occasionally with neurological involvement. Apart from serological relationships (Hierholzer et aL, 1979; Piazza, 1969) tides (Anderson et a& 1979; Bond et al, 1979) , very little is presently known about structural similarities or differences among MHV strains at the molecular level. We report here the results of comparative homology determinations on virus-specified RNAs and polypeptides of five selected strains of MHV. In conducting the studies on viral RNAs, we have made use of a complementary DNA probe prepared from nucleocapsid (N) protein messenger RNA isolated from cells infected with the A59 strain of MHV. The specificity of this cDNA including its ability to recognize common sequences in A59specified subgenomic RNAs has been documented elsewhere .",

In both L-2 and 17CL-1 cell cultures, maximum titers were reached between 12 and 16 hr p.i. for all five MHV strains tested. Growth of virus in LM cells in contrast was markedly reduced and the growth curves more erratic than those observed in L-2 or 17CL-1 cells. Longer term culturing of LM cells infected with all five MHV strains (unpublished) has shown that virus continues to be produced over several weeks in a similar fashion to that in a number of other cell lines previously shown to support a persistent infection of MHV (Lucas et al, 1978) . It is thus interesting that all five MHV strains show the ability to undergo either a productivity lytic (in L-2 cells) or a mildly eytopathic, chronic (in LM cells) type of infection depending on host cell. tein; this cDNA is specific for MHV sequences and shows no significant annealing with uninfected L-2 cell RNA (Cheley et ak, 1981) .

We have now identified an additional high-molecular-weight virus-specific RNA band which migrates more slowly than the ca. 4 X 106-dalton band (Fig. 2) and which would be in the molecular weight range that has been reported for virion RNA (Lai and Stohlman, 1978; .",

The Crtl,e values varied from 0.8 X 10-l to 1.6 X 10-l; this difference could be due to small discrepancies in the initial multiplicity of infection. All of these C,t1,z values correspond to greater than 1000 genome equivalents per infected cell using the calculation method of Varmus et al. (1973) . Thus all five murine hepatitis virus strains produced high levels of virus-specific RNA when infecting L-2 cells. As with our previous work , the cDNA annealed to less than 8% with uninfected L-2 cell RNA or yeast RNA. previously shown for MHV-3 (Anderson et aL, 1979; , JHM (Anderson et aL, 1979) , and A59 these four polypeptides constitute three major size classes of approximately 180,000, 50,000-56,000, and 20,000-25,000 daltons. The striking similarity in electrophoretic mobilities among the five strains of each of the four major polypeptides is evident from Fig. 5 . Nevertheless, slight variations in apparent molecular weight are detectable. Thus, for example, the polypeptides corresponding in size to the nucleocapsid N protein described for A59 (Sturman et cd, 1980 ) have the following approximate molecular weights as deduced from Fig. 5 ; MHV-1, 56,000; MHV-3, 56,000; MHV-S, 56,000; JHM, 55,000, and A59, 52,000. Although it remains to be demonstrated that similarsized polypeptides for each MHV strain are functionally and structurally equivalent, peptide mapping data on the N proteins (in the following section) as well as on the remaining viral proteins (unpublished) strongly suggested that this is, in fact, the case. We have, therefore, adopted the nomenclature proposed for A59 by Sturman et al. (1980) to designate the large ca. 180,000-dalton protein as E2 and the small, ca. 24,000-dalton protein as El, for each of the five MHV strains. As previously shown for MHV-3 El is post-translationally derived from PEl. Moreover, preliminary experiments with the other MHV strains suggest that in all cases a precursor-product relationship exists between the corresponding two polypeptides.",

In all five cases, coeluting peptides were evident at fraction numbers 30,50,58,71, and 96. Two of these peptide peaks (fraction numbers 50 and 58) were of much lower relative intensity in both the MHV-1 and MHV-S peptide profiles than with those of the other MHV strains. The reason for this difference in peak intensity is not known. One explanation is that these two peptides from MHV-1 and MHV-S, while chemically similar to corresponding peptides of the other three MHV strains, may be nevertheless somewhat more deficient in methionine, and hence in [35S]-methionine label. Alternatively, steric factors may limit quantitative liberation of these two peptides from MHV-1 and MHV-S-derived N proteins. Either of these explanations may also be applicable to the relatively low intensity of the fraction 58 peptide (relative to that at fraction 50) in the case of the MHV-3 N protein. As can be seen in Fig.  6 the peptide elution profiles for the MHV-1 and MHV-S N proteins were virtually identical, suggesting very strong relatedness between these two viral strains. Among the other three viruses, MHV-3, JHM, and A59, a majority of the N-protein-derived peptides comigrated, namely those around fraction numbers 10, 18, 30, 50, 58, 71, and 96. Since the migrational characteristics of a peptide may be altered by a single amino acid substitution (Ingram, 1956; Hunt and Ingram, 1959) , we interpret the above data as indicating a high degree of interstrain homology among nucleocapsid N proteins of murine coronaviruses.",

It is obvious from the present study as well as from our previous work that MHV-coded subgenomic RNAs contain common sequences. It has been demonstrated with the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (Stern and Kennedy, 1980) , that virus-specific, subgenomic RNAs may form a nested set with sequence homology at the 3' ends. Assuming a similar situation exists among murine coronaviruses, any alteration of a single subgenomic RNA species would also be present in all larger subgenomic RNA species. Thus, the atypical subgenomic RNA pattern exhibited by MHV-S may reflect genetic alteration at the third smallest subgenomic RNA (i.e., the smallest RNA species which shows altered electrophoretic mobility from the corresponding RNA of the other four MHV strains). It is interesting to note, nevertheless, that any such alteration is likely to have occurred within the structural protein-encoding regions of MHV-S RNA, since all three major structural MHV-S proteins show very little deviation in apparent molecular weight from those of the other MHV strains (Fig. 5) .",

From a survey of such studies, it is evident that genetic variation between related strains can involve changes at any sub-genomic site. There may, however, be a relatively greater degree of conservation within regions encoding internal virion polypeptides than within those coding for surface polypeptides. In rationalizing this observation it has been suggested (Doe1 and Brown, 1978; Laver and Downie, 1976) that sequence conservation among internal virion polypeptides may reflect stringent structural constraints imposed on such polypeptides by the precise nature of their interactions during virus assembly. Thus, in the case of MI-IV, in which the major internal protein is the nucleocapsid polypeptide (Struman et al, 1980) , one might expect that this polypeptide be fairly conserved among various strains of MHV. Indeed, the results of the present study demonstrate strong relatedness of all five MHV isolates in both the N polypeptide as well as its corresponding RNA coding sequence. Studies are presently in progress to determine homology relationships of the remaining two major virion structural polypeptides El and E2.",

The results of the present study suggest a high degree of relatedness among different MHV strains and thus provide hope that such determinants may eventually be identified.",
