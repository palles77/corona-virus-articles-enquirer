This was not widely publicized, and the condition remained isolated to China for the next 3 months. On February 21, 2003, a Chinese physician from the Guangdong Province (patient A in Figure 1 ) who cared for patients with pneumonia and had himself developed symp-toms traveled to Hong Kong to visit relatives. He stayed on the ninth floor of Hotel M for a day. On February 22, 2003, he was admitted to Hospital 2 with fever and respiratory symptoms and died of respiratory failure on March 4, 2003 . He infected 2 of his family members and 4 health care workers (HCWs) in Hospital 2. In addition, 12 other hotel guests at Hotel M developed SARS, 10 of whom (patients B through K) were in the hotel the same day as patient A; the other 2 patients (patients L and M) stayed in the hotel during the time that 3 other symptomatic patients were guests at the hotel. Because of international travel and transmission to HCWs before the institution of protective measures, these patients were responsible for subsequent clusters of SARS around the globe. Patient B was the index patient for the outbreak in Hanoi involving HCWs and close contacts, including Dr Urbani. Patients C, D, and E were the index cases in Singapore. Patients F and G traveled back to Toronto, Canada, which resulted in the cluster of cases in Toronto. Patients H and J caused outbreaks among HCWs in other hospitals in Hong Kong. Patient L appears to have become infected during his stay at Hotel M, with subsequent transmission to his wife, patient M in the United States ( Figure 1 ).",

            "text": "The incubation period is 2 to 10 days. Early manifestations include influenza-like symptoms, such as fever, myalgias, and headache. Fever occurs in virtually all patients and is often the presenting symptom. Often, fever is high and sometimes associated with chills and rigors. Fever may occasionally be absent in elderly persons or may have resolved by the time respiratory symptoms occur. Typically, rash and neurologic findings are absent. Diarrhea has been reported in up to 25% of patients. [5] [6] [7] The respiratory phase starts within 2 to 4 days of onset of fever with a dry, nonproductive cough. This may progress to shortness of breath, usually in the second week of the illness, and might be accompanied by or progress to hypoxemia. In 10% to 20% of patients, the respiratory illness is severe enough to require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The case fatality rate is approximately 3% to 12% overall. The mortality rate may be as high as 45% in patients older than 60 years, particularly those with preexisting comorbidity (eg, diabetes, renal failure, and other chronic medical conditions). 8 A concerning feature of this disease has been that young, previously healthy persons, many of them health care professionals, have also died of SARS. The reason for this is unclear but may be due to exposure to patients with higher viral loads or due to their host response. In contrast, SARS has affected relatively few children and appears to be milder in the pediatric age group. 9 A biphasic course has been described in many patients, with an initial illness followed by improvement and then subsequent deterioration. This worsening can present as recurrent fever 4 to 7 days after initial defervescence, new chest infiltrates, respiratory failure, or watery diarrhea. In a cohort of 75 patients in Hong Kong, 85% had recurrent symptoms after initial improvement. 8 The authors described a triphasic course with fever, myalgia early in week 1, and recurrent fever, hypoxemia, diarrhea, and shifting chest infiltrates in week 2. Twenty percent of patients progressed to ARDS during the third week of the illness. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirate in 14 patients with relapse showed peak viral loads occurred at day 10 after onset of symptoms, suggesting that the late deterioration may be due to the host immune response rather than to uncontrolled viral replication.",

Several diagnostic laboratory methods were used to initially recover and then characterize coronavirus infection in various specimens obtained from patients with SARS. These included inoculation and recovery of the virus in cell cultures, characterization of morphologic features by electron microscopy, serologic antibody determination, and molecular amplification and sequencing of the target RNA of the agent. Overall, 45 of the 50 patients these investigators studied had 1 or more laboratory tests (serology, 32; RT-PCR, 22; culture, 2) that supported a coronavirus etiology. The results of this initial report were quickly confirmed and expanded by collaborative studies in several major public health centers and medical institutions throughout the world coordinated by the World Health Organization. 12, 13 Molecular sequencing analyses have indicated that the virus is only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses. Based on serologic studies, it appears that this virus has not previously circulated in humans and is now referred to as SARS-CoV. 14, 15 Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that cause disease in humans and animals. The previously known human coronaviruses are a major cause of the common cold and can occasionally cause pneumonia. Research teams in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China, recently detected several coronaviruses closely related genetically to the SARS-CoV in 2 animal species (masked palm civet and raccoon-dog) and antibodies against the SARS-CoV in 1 additional species (Chinese ferret badger). These and other wild animals are traditionally considered delicacies and are sold for human consumption in markets throughout southern China.",

Recent data suggest that the virus may remain viable for considerable periods on a dry surface (up to 24 hours); hence, transmission through fomites may occur. The outbreak in an apartment complex in Hong Kong that accounted for more than 300 cases has been attributed to fecal spread. A patient with SARS who had diarrhea stayed with his brother in this building. It is thought that infection spread from him to other residents in the building through a leaking sewage drain, which allowed aerosolization of virus-containing material. Sewage also backed into bathroom floor drains in some apartments and may have accounted for some of the transmission. The SARS-CoV is stable in feces (and urine) at room temperature for at least 1 to 2 days. The virus is more stable (up to 4 days) in stool from patients with diarrhea (which has a higher pH than normal stool). 16 It is presently unclear at what stage of the disease viral shedding occurs or whether someone who is infected but asymptomatic can infect others. As our knowledge of SARS and the etiologic coronavirus evolves, we will be able to address these important issues.",

In Singapore, 5 super spreaders were responsible for a total of 170 suspect and probable cases of SARS. 17 Additional data on the natural history of infection are needed to understand factors that might be associated with this phenomenon.

Nevertheless, reasonable precautions should be taken in handling these specimens. The CDC recommends that specimens from patients with SARS be labeled accordingly and that the laboratory be alerted before the samples are sent. Laboratory workers who handle these specimens should use standard precautions in a Biosafety Level 2 laboratory. Any procedure with the potential to generate fine particulate aerosols should be performed in a biological safety cabinet. 19 TREATMENT There is no specific treatment currently available for SARS. Management consists of supportive care and appropriate infection control measures to prevent spread. Because the diagnosis is uncertain, empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia should be administered by using antibiotics with activity against both typical and atypical respiratory pathogens including influenza when appropriate. In all series of SARS cases described to date, therapy has involved broad-spectrum antibiotics, including a fluoroquinolone or macrolide. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used in most patients treated in Hong Kong and in Toronto, without evidence of efficacy. 7,10 The adverse effects of ribavirin are significant, particularly hemolytic anemia and electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia; hence, empirical therapy with ribavirin is not warranted.",
