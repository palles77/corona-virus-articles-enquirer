            "text": "Occupational Medicine: An Asset in Time of Crisis Tee L. Guidotti Disasters, by definition, are more than just \"large-scale\" incidents or events with multiple casualties. They differ qualitatively from routine medical emergencies and public health threats. 1 This qualitative difference arises from the disruption of normal support systems and saturation of available residual capacity and capability, which is much degraded from normal operations: supply of resources exceeds demands of the disaster. It manifests itself in inaccessibility of routine system dependent resources and impediments to operations such as communication failures. Reliance on routine standard operating procedures becomes counterproductive, yielding highly individualistic on-the-spot innovation and improvisation risks causing confusion, thus making matters worse. Accompanying the disaster is the emergency management equivalent of \"the fog of war,\" a condition of knowledge privation resulting not only from shortages of information but also from miscommunication, unfamiliar vocabulary (especially in industrial or chemical disasters), distortions, preconceived notions that have not yet been corrected in the event, and the seductive but often misleading tendency to rely on the experience from the most recent similar event.",

            "text": "In a disaster, the strategy of protecting the individual necessarily gives way to that of protecting the population. In other words, medical care gives way in priority to public health, and the system needs the versatility to manage this transition smoothly. To achieve this, occupational medicine (OM), and the occupational health service (OHS) that provides both primary and preventive care, wellness programs, and management services in health, is the pivot point within employer organizations. 2 (See Box 30-1 for a list of acronyms used in this chapter.) Corporations and other large institutions became deeply concerned with continuity of operations and the security of their personnel after 9/11 and have maintained this concern since, reinforced by natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina. For effective response to a disaster, responders need to have the appropriate tools and training for the mission. For effective response to the unpredictable and especially the unexpected, responders must be prepared for multiple events, have flexible approaches, be cross-trained, and have the capacity and capability to deal with \"all threats\" rather than one type of emergency at a time.",

A management model developed by Jean-Pierre Robin, at Noranda, an aluminum producer, suggests that any organization that creates wealth and adds value cannot rely on routine operations and public services for protection against catastrophic disruption and that sustainability must rest on a foundation that includes special functions designed to assure its security and continuity of operations. The OHS is key to continuity and therefore sustainability, and, to be effective, its functions are integrated with other protective services within the company, in a hierarchical manner.

            "text": "Box 30-2 presents the usual functions of a corporate medical department, provided or supervised by occupational physicians. 3, 5, 7, 8 These functions have traditionally been clustered in a few broad missions: to protect health, to support productivity, to reduce loss and liability, to manage health affairs, and to ensure compliance with regulations and best practice for the industry. These functions have traditionally been viewed as support functions, not part of the business operations of the organization. Indeed, this is why these functions were subject to outsourcing throughout the private and government sectors during the 1980s and 1990s. Disaster management, by its nature, does not lend itself well to outsourcing and so virtually every major employer has some form of emergency management and disaster response plan, contingency, or capacity built into its global operations plan. 7 OHSs are perhaps most familiar in the manufacturing sector, public safety services, and in the setting of a plant medical clinic. Typically, such services include at least one occupational health nurse (also a professional specialization), an occupational physician (typically on contract), and support staff, all of whom report on a regular basis to a plant manager and are responsible professionally to a corporate medical director, who serves as a traveling troubleshooter, an in-house resource on health issues, and an auditor for health affairs. This physician-led, health-centered team typically is engaged in regular interaction and problem solving in collaboration with an industrial hygienist and safety officer, who are usually oriented more toward process and plant operations, documenting regulatory compliance, and identifying and measuring health hazards. These hazard-oriented professionals usually report through a different manager or directly to the plant manager. This basic pattern was once the norm in industry, but the dramatic reorganization in industry, the management focus on core business, and the rise of the service sector have forged a new pattern, in which services are outsourced to contractors and consultants. 8 The full-time, physician-led, fully staffed on-site medical facility has been mostly replaced in sectors by a leaner model, in which physicians contract with multiple employers to provide services at various facilities on a part-time basis or send workers out to see designated physicians in the local community. Large employers, with bigger operations and more at risk, are much more likely to have fully staffed OHSs, as well as the capacity and capability to respond during a disaster. 3 However, whichever pattern is followed in a particular enterprise, the essentials are in place in most large operations for a response to protect health in a disaster: a means of monitoring the health of workers, a system for documenting their health, a system for documenting and evaluating hazards, a mechanism for responding to emergencies, and access to a panel of health consultants. 3 An in-house, corporate, or on-site plant-level OHS usually is already involved within the organization in planning the medical response to emergencies, networking with local hospitals and health agencies, and providing services for casualties who can be helped with available resources, and diverting them away from local hospitals with limited capacity. They also deploy resources for dealing in the first instance (especially triage) with serious injuries and mass casualties, and provide health protection for key personnel (such as diabetic personnel) as required. This existing resource provides the platform that large organizations need to respond to disasters and to protect the security and \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome,\" a novel viral disease originating in China and disseminated from Hong Kong that caused an intercontinental outbreak in 2002 and 2003; travel restrictions were imposed by many multinational employers at the time to protect their workers and prevent spread of the disease SDS \"Safety data sheet,\" which is a summary of the hazard of chemicals that must be provided by the manufacturer and distributor for all chemicals sold in the United States and many other countries; the SDS replaced the \"material safety data sheet\" and indicates that the document conforms to the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals 186 SECTION III Pre-Event Topics continuity of operations. 9 Involvement of the OHS in emergency management is a natural extension of the existing mission of the OHS. Disaster medicine involves only an increment of further training and preparation for consequence management and mitigation activities (as described in this textbook), preparedness for a response within the physical plant, and planning for the management of risks inherent to the operation of the specific industrial site and processes. 3, 10 The most obvious role for the OHS in a disaster mode is as a \"poste m\u00e9dicale avanc\u00e9,\" a forward medical position. 1 In an emergency, casualties may be brought for triage; minor wounds treated; the injured stabilized for transport; and the worried may be examined, counseled, and, importantly, kept away from the nearest hospital, which should be reserved for seriously injured casualties. This clinical role is often assumed by managers to be the obvious role for the OHS. In practice, this is usually impractical because of insufficient staffing, although some large companies, especially in manufacturing and industries in which there is a high potential risk of injury, do have this advanced OHS. However, the true value lies elsewhere, and this is where the pivot from medical care to the public health model comes into play.",

This is why adaptation of the existing OHS makes sense for many employers, especially those in critical or hazardous industries. 3 Adaptation of the OHS also lends itself to an \"all-threats\" approach, since the occupational health staff is already intimately involved with hazards in the community. 12 Focusing too narrowly on one particular threat degrades the quality of response to all threats. This degradation in capacity and capability due to over-emphasis was one of the chief concerns among the public health community in the years immediately following 2001, when emergency management was focused too narrowly on terrorism preparedness and the nation's public health capacity and capability was still grossly underfunded and its infrastructure overly centralized and dependent on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Later in the decade, a spate of natural disasters featuring the incompetent response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 made the wisdom of an all-threats approach to emergency management abundantly clear.",

A purpose-built system to detect and deal with a bioterror threat, alone and in isolation, was the initial knee-jerk response, but such an approach would have almost certainly been doomed to failure. Timely and fluent response requires practice and unexpected and unpredictable tests of the system. Bioterrorism events are very rare, but a public health department responds weekly and (in large communities) daily to outbreaks of infectious disease of one type or another, from simple food poisoning to urgent events that simulate plausible scenarios for a bioterror attack because they resemble scenarios following intentional introduction of a pathogen: the SARS epidemic of 2002, the West Nile Virus outbreak of 2002-2003, the H1N1 pandemic influenza epidemic of 2009, and current outbreaks and numerous serious outbreaks on a local level, such as dengue in Florida. It is now realized and accepted in government and homeland security circles, not just in the public health community, that a competent response to bioterrorism, an extremely rare event, requires competence in responding to these other infectious disease outbreaks. Further, development of this broader competence has led to greater capacity to plan and capability to respond to much more likely threats, such as pandemic influenza. As true as this demonstrably was for infectious threats, it is equally true for chemical hazards, radiation threats, and physical hazards, all of which are already in the mandate of the OHS and within the documented competencies of OM as a field. 5, 14 Incorporating emergency management into the mission of the OHS builds the efficiencies and redundancies required for a proper community response. The same resources used for tracking employees' health can be used for surveillance to detect potential disease outbreaks due to bioterrorism. The technology of hazard identification and measurement can be applied to detect chemical or radiation threats. The medical staff on duty primarily to monitor health and to provide timely clinical care can provide surge capability in time of crisis. Health protection for senior executives, and the personal knowledge that entails, can provide the detailed knowledge of health needs required to keep key personnel on the job and safe, especially when they are moved to new locations or are operating under conditions of stress and potential risk. The skills that are normally applied to ensure a safe workplace can be used to determine when it is acceptable to return to work or to venture into a facility that has been contaminated or damaged. Planning for foreseeable industrial disasters can inform and refine the response to unforeseen threats, given that sophisticated disaster planning is a matter of identifying resources and contingencies, not deriving detailed plans for single-threat incidents.",

This may lead to cost savings, increased productivity, and reduced liability as added value. Conscious of their responsibility, and aware of their own position on the firing line along with the employees and executives they protect, OPs have been preparing themselves for an expanded role in emergency management. The principal specialty organization, the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM), has for some time offered training in topics relevant to emergency management. In 1999, the ACOEM began providing continuing education on the characteristics of weapons of mass destruction. Offerings have included emerging infections (particularly using the model of SARS), tabletop exercises to train participants in emergency management, health protection of first responders, and consequence management for disasters and mass casualties. Immediately following the tragedy of 9/11, an ACOEM task force produced a guide to the management of mental health issues among survivors of mass assaults, disseminated it to all members and posted it on the college website: all within four days. This achievement was unique and widely admired at the time among medical specialty organizations.",

Because occupational health is cross-cutting across industries, the vision was for OH-CG to serve as a resource for other critical sectors rather than to focus on the health sector itself. However this proved to be nearly impossible because the OH-CG was embedded in an ISAC interested in acute delivery of health care and the supply chain, not protection for workers across critical sectors. As a result, from the beginning, the OH-CG was effectively marginalized, and it lacked the mandate or leverage to reach out to other critical sectors.

OHDEN was a web-based system for sharing information and templates for employee tracking, disaster response, and hazard information. Its mission was to provide occupational health professionals with what they need when they need it in time of crisis, through channels that do not depend on any one mode of communication. OHDEN's first \"proof of concept\" came before it was really ready, when it briefly \"went live\" immediately following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and was able to broker the timely sharing of information on guidelines for fitness-for-duty and return to work for employees in disaster-struck areas. A second test came in 2006 when its open website (now taken down) disseminated best practices in corporate policies related to pandemic influenza. Both \"dry runs\" were judged successful at the time, with evidence that the information was actually used. Unfortunately, despite efforts, no external funding to support OHDEN was forthcoming, and it was too large a project to be financed by ACOEM acting alone.

            "text": "In the classic business model followed during times of business as usual, the priorities of corporate management are shareholder value and profitability, continuity of production and operations, and loss control and risk management, in that order. For government agencies, there is a similar set of priorities with the mission of the agency coming first. However, in times of crisis, survival of the enterprise and protection of people take precedence. In the past, OM and OHSs have always been perceived as support functions, facilitating management priorities, but not as a core business priority. In the new era of threats to survival and business continuity, the OHS and the physicians in them may play a role in the survival of the enterprise and its people. A wise organization, faced with an extraordinary threat, may look within to build its salvation on a functioning system that is already serving its interests.",
