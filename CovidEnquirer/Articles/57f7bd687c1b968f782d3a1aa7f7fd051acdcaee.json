Therefore, researches targeting these viruses have been required. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been rising targets of some flavonoids. The antiviral activity of some flavonoids against CoVs is presumed directly caused by inhibiting 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Here, we applied a flavonoid library to systematically probe inhibitory compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin were found to efficiently block the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The interaction of the three flavonoids was confirmed using a tryptophan-based fluorescence method, too. An induced-fit docking analysis indicated that S1, S2 and S3 0 sites are involved in binding with flavonoids. The comparison with previous studies showed that Triton X-100 played a critical role in objecting false positive or overestimated inhibitory activity of flavonoids. With the systematic analysis, the three flavonoids are suggested to be templates to design functionally improved inhibitors.",

CoVs, along with Artierivirdae and Roniviridae, belong to the Coronaviridae family in the order Nidovirales. These CoVs can infect various hosts, including avian, swine and humans. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) represent a major group of CoVs associated with various respiratory diseases from common cold to serious pneumonia and bronchiolitis 2 . Today, HCoVs are recognised as one of the fastest-evolving viruses derived from their characteristic high genomic nucleotide replacement rates and recombination 3 . Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the first confirmed atypical pneumonia in China's Guangdong province, has spread to several countries. The most common symptoms of SARS include coughing, high fever (>38 C), chills, convulsions, headaches, dizziness and progressive radiographic changes of the chest and lymphopenia 4 . The severity of the disease shows a death rate of about 3% to 6%, although this rate could rise up to 43% to 55% for senior citizens older than 60 years 5 . The primary epidemic of SARS was eventually controlled, but a SARS CoV-like virus was detected in Chinese bats 6, 7 . Besides, a recent pandemic of middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus MERS-CoV raises fear of possible recurrence of SARS or related dangerous diseases 8, 9 . Since there is no vaccine and effective therapy for these viral infections, developing anti-SARS drugs against future outbreaks remains a formidable challenge.",

ORF1a encodes two cysteine proteases, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3C-like protease (3CLpro). While PLpro cuts the first three cleavage sites of its polyprotein, 3CLpro is responsible for cleavage of the remaining 11 locations resulting in release of a total of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp) in both SARS-and MERS-CoVs. The homodimeric form of 3CLpro is active in the presence of substrates. The crystal structures of both 3CLpros showed that each monomer is composed of three structural domains: domains I and II form a chymotrypsin-like architecture with a catalytic cysteine and are connected to a third C-terminal domain via a long loop 10 . In the proteolytic site, all 3CLpros prefer glutamine at P1 position and leucine, basic residues, small hydrophobic residues at P2, P3 and P4 positions, respectively 11 . At P1 0 and P2 0 positions, small residues are required. However, P3 0 position shows no strong preference. Since the autocleavage process is essential for viral propagation, 3CLpro is a good drug target for anti-coronaviral infection.",

The plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 150 lg ml \u00c01 ampicillin. Several colonies were picked and grown in capped test tubes with 10 ml LB broth containing 150 lg ml \u00c01 ampicillin.

The frozen cell stock was grown in 5 ml LB medium and diluted into 1000 ml fresh LB medium. The culture was incubated at 310 K with shaking until an OD 600 of 0.6-0.8 was reached. At this point, the expression of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro was induced using isopropyl-b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 1 mM.

This substrate contains the nsp4/nsp5 cleavage sequence, GVLQ#SG 19 , and works as a generic peptide substrate for many coronavirus including the SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The peptide was dissolved in distilled water and incubated with each protease. A SpectraMax i3x Multi-mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices) was used to measure spectral-based fluorescence. The proteolytic activity was determined at 310 K by following the increase in fluorescence (k excitation \u00bc 340 nm, k emission \u00bc 490 nm, bandwidths \u00bc 9, 15 nm, respectively) of EDANS upon peptide hydrolysis as a function of time. Assays were conducted in black, 96-well plates (Nunc) in 300 ll assay buffers containing protease and substrate as follow; For the SARS-CoV 3CLpro assay, 4.05 ll of 0.074 mM protease containing 50 mM Tris pH 6.5 was incubated with 7.5 ll of 0.1 mM substrate at 310 K for 2 h before measuring Relative Fluorescence Unit (RFU). Before the assay, the emission spectra of 64 flavonoids were surveyed after illuminating at 340 nm to avoid the overlapping with the emission spectrum of EDANS. Every compound was suitable to be tested. The final concentration of the protease, peptide and chemical used at the assay was 1, 2.5 and 20 lM each. At first, the SARS-CoV 3CLpro and chemical were mixed and pre-incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate and each well was incubated at 310 K for 16 h. After that, we measured the fluorescence of the mixture on the black 96-well plate using the endpoint mode of SpectraMax i3x where the excitation wavelength was fixed to 340 nm and the emission wavelength was set to 490 nm using 9, 15 nm bandwidth, respectively. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. Among the first 64 flavonoids (Supplementary Table 1 ), three of them were picked up to further assay at a concentration range of 2-320 lM. The IC 50 value which is the value causing 50% inhibition of the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism 7.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).",

Therefore, if tryptophan is positioned adequately in proteins, the change of fluorescence intensity can reflect the binding state of chemicals and be used to judge interaction between proteins and chemicals. The SARS-CoV 3CLpro contains one tryptophan residue (Trp31) at the catalytic domain. Its backbone lines up at the entrance of the active site. Therefore, its fluorescence change can reflect environmental variation of the active site. The catalytic domain of SARS-CoV 3CLpro used in this study displays a fluorescence peak at 340 nm after the tryptophan excitation wavelength of 290 nm. We monitored the change of the fluorescence intensities depending on the presence or absence of all flavonoids. Since each compound in the flavonoid library was almost non-fluorescent under the experiment condition, a change of fluorescence intensity reflects interactions between the catalytic domain and chemicals. Intriguingly, the three inhibitory compounds obviously reduced the fluorescence intensity of the catalytic domain compared with others ( Figure 3 ). The decreased emission intensity confirmed the complex formation between the catalytic domain and inhibitory compounds.",

In particular, they belong to a type of plant secondary metabolites with a polyphenolic structure widely found in fruits and vegetables. They have miscellaneous reciprocal biochemical and antioxidant effects associated with various diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis [25] [26] [27] . It is due to antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagens and anti-cancer-causing properties combined with the ability to control major cell enzyme functions 15 . Intriguingly, some flavonoids also have antiviral activity 17 . Specifically, apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, amentoflavone 28 , quercetin, daidzein, puerarin, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin gallate 29 and kaempferol 30 were reported to inhibit the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Therefore, the antiviral effect is presumed to be directly linked to suppress the activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in some cases. However, the systematic analysis using various scaffolds of flavonoids was not reported. In order to find the best scaffold to inhibit the function of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, an assay with various flavonoid derivatives classified in 10 scaffolds was built and performed. Among them, the best compounds were one flavonol, herbacetin and two flavones, rhoifolin and pectolinarin. In the current assay method including 0.01% Triton X-100, the three flavonoids showed the better inhibitory activity than the previously reported flavonoids as mentioned above [28] [29] [30] . The aggregating tendency of flavonoids frequently leads to obtain false bioassay results and can be avoided by adding 0.01% Triton X-100 24 . It is worthwhile to note that amentoflavone, the most effective flavonoid inhibiting SARS-CoV 3CLpro 28 , did not effectively function in the presence of 0.01% Triton X-100 ( Figure 5) .",

The glide scores of three compounds were -9.263, -8.526 and -8.930, respectively. The tendency of the glide scores is matched with the binding affinity of the compounds. The comparison of the predicted binding modes of three complex structures showed critical factors governing their binding affinity. In common, they share the kaempferol motif. As shown in Figure 4 , the phenyl moiety of kaempferol occupies the S1 site of SARS-CoV through a hydrogen bond with Glu166. In contrast, the chromen-4-one scaffold of kaempferol locates in the S2 site. In herbacetin, total of four hydrogen bonds are formed 5 .011. S1 represents the polar S1 site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, S2 for the hydrophobic S2 site, and the S3 0 site with no strong tendency. The pink arrows represent hydrogen bond interaction. within a distance of 2.33 \u00c5 in the S2 site. Especially, the major binding force was driven by the presence of the additional 8hydroxyl group which plays a critical role in binding with Glu166 and Gln189. These bindings are predicted to confer a good glide score of herbacetin. In contrast, the binding modes of morin and kaemperol become different due to the absence of above two hydrogen bonds due the lack of the 8-hydroxyl group (Figure 4) . The absence also induces the change nullifying the hydrogen bond formed by the 5-hydroxyl group of the chromen-4-one scaffold with Asp187 observed in herbacetin. Though there is a new hydrogen bond formed through the 3-hydroxyl group, it may not enough to overcome the loss of binding capacity induced by the 8-hydroxyl group. This survey shows the importance of the 8hydroxyl group at the strong binding affinity of herbacetin.",

The presence of additional 8hydroxyl group of herbacetin was expected to be critical to acquire its high binding affinity around the S1 and S2 sites. The occupation of the S1 and S2 sites by carbohydrate groups of rhoifolin and pectolinarin was anticipated to be another way of getting high affinity to SARS-CoV 3CLpro in glycosylated flavonoids.
