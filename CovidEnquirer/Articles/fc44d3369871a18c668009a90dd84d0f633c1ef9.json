One group of primers was designed to detect wild-type strains (i.e., strains with the gE gene) and the other group of primers was designed to detect both PRV gE-vaccine and wild-type strains (i.e., strains with the gG gene and with or without the gE gene). After amplification by Bst enzyme at a constant temperature of 65 \u2022 C, a laddering of bright products was visible following electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. LAMP was 100-1000-fold more sensitive than the standard PCR. The assay was specific in that it did not amplify other porcine viruses including porcine parvovirus, porcine circovirus type 1, porcine circovirus type 2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, classical swine fever virus, swine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Because of its sensitivity, specificity, and simplicity, the LAMP assay could be a useful method for early and rapid differentiation of swine vaccinated with PRV gE-deleted vaccine from swine infected with wild virus.",

Samples from the cerebrum were collected from 70 piglets suspected of being infected with PRV in Hei Long Jiang and Ji Lin provinces. These piglets exhibited the clinical manifestations of disease such as high fever, diarrhea, depression, disgorging, loose stools, ataxia, epilepsy, circling, hindquarter paralysis, and opisthotonos. The disease caused rapid death of the piglets. Because the piglets showed some clinical signs of PRV and CSFV, swine fever infection was also suspected, but CSFV was not detected by RT-PCR (unpublished data). The infected piglets that were sampled were 3-5 days old. Although all the sows on these farms had been treated with the PRV gE-vaccine about 6 months before the samples were collected, none of the piglets had been treated with PRV gE-vaccine.

In viral assays, specificity and sensitivity are essential in cases where low concentrations of virus are expected. PRV-LAMP is specific analytically (it did not amplify seven other porcine viruses) and is much more sensitive analytically and easier to perform than classical PRV-PCR. Although typical PCR is inferior to the PRV-specific real-time PCR, the sensitivity of the PRV-LAMP and the PRV-specific real-time PCR was compared in another study; the sensitivity of the two assays was similar, i.e., both assays detected 10 copies per sample (unpublished data). Although our unpublished results indicate that the PRV-LAMP is as sensitive as the PRV-specific real-time PCR, the PRV-LAMP is easier and requires less time to perform than the PRVspecific real-time PCR. These characteristics should make LAMP very useful for field tests and in other situations where a rapid, simple test is required.",

(2008) described a LAMP system for PRV detection but that LAMP system could not differentiate between swine infected with wild-type PRV and swine vaccinated with PRV gE-deleted. All the vaccines used in China now are gE-deleted and gG-retained.

The identify of the virus in the clinical samples was confirmed by isolation and sequencing and also by injecting the isolated virus into rabbits, which developed subsequently neurological signs of PRV including the chewing of the leg at the injection site, ataxia, hindquarter paralysis, and opisthotonos (data not shown).
