It is the most feared disease today in breeding catteries, but is less common and of less concern in the general pet population (Wolf, 1995; Kass and Dent, 1995; . There is no effective treatment for FIP, and once classical disease occurs, mortality is nearly 100%. The only available commercial vaccine is less than 100% effective. Available laboratory tests detect feline coronavirus antibodies and therefore are not specific for FIP. Until recently, there was no test to detect FIP antigen, virus, or to identify virus carrier cats. The reliability of new antigen detection tests is still being evaluated. A cattery with enzootic FIP is difficult to manage. The great variability in incubation period of FIP (weeks, months, or even years) presents a serious challenge to prevention and control. A comprehensive review of FIP virus was published in 1993 by Olsen. This review covers the molecular biology of the virus, immunopathogenesis of infection, clinical aspects of the disease, and a discussion of vaccination for FIP. Two reviews of FIPV were published in 1995 (de Groot and Horzinek, 1995; Pedersen, 1995b) . A series of manuscripts was published in Feline Practice as the Proceedings of the 1994 International Workshop on FIPV and FECV (Vol. 23 [3] , 1995).",

There is minimal clinical disease during the primary infection, often just a transient fever for one to a few days. Antibodies against FIPV first appear in serum by day 7 to day 10 after infection, and then infection of macrophages occurs. Fc receptors on macrophages enable uptake of virusantibody complexes, and infected macrophages transport the virus throughout the body. Secondary infection then occurs in many tissues, with macrophages attaching to and migrating through the walls of veins. A perivascular reaction occurs, leading to development of a pyogranuloma, the basic lesion of FIP within tissues.",

However, many cats develop aspects of an immune response without developing protection. In some cases, this host response makes the cat more susceptible to exposure to FIPV rather than providing protection. Humoral immunity results in serum virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies which first appear 7-10 days after infection. There is a gradual increase in VN titers until 5-6 weeks after infection, with a hypergammaglobulinemia occurring in most cats that develop clinical FIP. The VN antibodies against epitopes on the S or spike protein usually are enhancing antibodies if the right concentration of virus and antibodies exists . The subclass of IgG produced may be important in determining if true immunity occurs .",

Although ADE does not appear to be a major problem under field conditions, apparently due to the relatively small amount of virus shed from infected and carrier cats, it is virtually impossible to determine if an individual case of FIP is a result of ADE infection or nonenhanced infection. The incubation period is the only differentiating difference, with ADE infection resulting in severe clinical FIP within 12 days after exposure to virus (Scott et al., 1995b; Weiss and Scott, 1981) . Nonenhanced infection does not result in severe disease until after 12 days from exposure. Since the time of exposure to virus is almost always impossible to determine in field infections, it is likewise virtually impossible to determine with certainty whether or not a particular infection is enhanced or not. In one study of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in two high-risk cat populations in Switzerland (Fehr et al., 1995) , the authors state that the vaccine did not result in enhanced disease. Yet evaluation of the reported results indicates that three cats developed FIP within the first month after vaccination, while none of the placebo vaccinated cats developed FIP within this time. Were these cases of enhanced disease? It is impossible to ascertain, but it is also impossible to rule out enhanced disease based on these data.",

In the Switzerland study mentioned earlier (Fehr et al., 1995) , 609 domestic and purebred household pet cats were studied in the double-blind placebo controlled field study. During the 12 months after vaccination, FIP was confirmed in 13/31 deaths in the vaccinated group compared to 17/34 deaths in the control group. The authors state that \"Death losses in placebo and vaccinate groups were equal up to day 150 following immunization, while significantly more placeboimmunized animals died of FIP after that period.\" In this author's review of the data in this study (Fehr et al., 1995) , there were two more deaths in the vaccinated group (n = 12) compared to the control group (n = 10) through 150 days, and an equal number of deaths from FIP (n = 13 for both groups) through 250 days after vaccination. After this 250-day period there were four deaths in the control group but no deaths in the vaccinated group. A disturbing finding is that two of the deaths in the vaccinated group occurred within the first few days after vaccination, while none of the deaths in the control group occurred within this time period. Were these cats merely incubating the disease at the time of vaccination and would have died anyway, or were these early deaths after vaccination a result of enhanced disease from the vaccine in cats that were already antibody positive? It is impossible in this review to ascertain the exact situation in these two cats. In any case, Primucell FIP did not reduce the incidence of FIP within this high-risk pet population of cats for 8 months after vaccination, or until the cats were at least 1 year of age.",

However, the panel was split as to what constituted risk of exposure to FIP-inducing coronaviruses. A minority of the panel members recommended vaccination of kittens and cats with lifestyles that resulted in substantial risk of exposure to coronaviruses. Most panel members recommended that vaccination be limited to cats in specific risk situations, such as households in which FIP had been diagnosed. Those cats for which vaccination is deemed appropriate should receive a foundation series of vaccinations as kittens, according to recognized protocols.
