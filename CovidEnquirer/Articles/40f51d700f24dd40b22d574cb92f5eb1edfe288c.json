The purpose of this network is to provide timely and accurate laboratory results to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Deeply integrated with field case-based surveillance, it ultimately provides molecular epidemiological data from polioviruses used to inform programmatic and immunization activities. This network of global coverage requires substantial investments in laboratory infrastructure, equipment, supplies, reagents, quality assurance, staffing and training, often in resource-limited settings. The GPLN has not only developed country capacities, but it also serves as a model to other global laboratory networks for vaccinepreventable diseases that will endure after the polio eradication goal is achieved. Leveraging lessons learned during past 27 years, the authors discuss options for transitioning GPLN assets to support control of other viral vaccine-preventable, emerging, and reemerging diseases.

Selected laboratories were enrolled into a collaborating network, the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) coordinated by WHO. Network membership depended on nomination by host government, on-site evaluation by WHO of physical infrastructure, availability of suitably qualified personnel, and ability to accurately implement recommended procedures for poliovirus detection and characterization. Although not every country has a GPLN laboratory, each is linked to designated laboratories where specimens could be referred for rapid testing. After the initial decade of growth linked to introduction of regional eradication goals and corresponding surveillance programs, GPLN membership has been mostly constant; currently, 146 laboratories are enrolled and originally categorized into 3 groups ( Figure 1 ) with defined responsibilities: (1) subnational and national laboratories (n = 123), (2) regional reference laboratories (n = 17), and (3) global specialized laboratories (n = 6).",

These procedures were aligned with the 3 tiers within the GPLN. During recent years, the capacities of these laboratories have evolved tremendously, and GPLN's laboratories have developed new capacities at all levels. It is noteworthy that >90 national/intercountry polio laboratories currently have intratypic differentiation capacity, and many regional and some national laboratories have sequencing capacities; 27 laboratories participated in the 2016 proficiency testing as part of establishing this recognized capacity. In addition, these expanded capabilities will be an important factor in fulfilling requirements of the WHO Global Action Plan to minimize the poliovirus facility-associated risk of introducing eradicated viruses into the population. As part of the process defined by this plan and with the aim of containing poliovirus in a few facilities, some specialized and regional laboratories will be designated as polio-essential facilities for containment of polioviruses.",

As polio eradication approaches, the polio endgame opens opportunities to formulate and validate the best strategies to transition all assets generated by the GPEI.

We are also grateful to laboratory scientists and other workers of the 146 laboratories of the GPLN, as well as the surveillance field workers and country program counterparts at all levels working in the GPEI. Last, building and strengthening the GPLN would not be possible without the sustained contributions of the GPEI international partnership to the effort, namely, WHO, Rotary International, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the US Agency for International Development, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",
