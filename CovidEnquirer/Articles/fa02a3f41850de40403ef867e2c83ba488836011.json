            "text": "a b s t r a c t RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism for suppressing or silencing expression of aberrant or foreign genes. It is a powerful antiviral strategy that has been widely employed to protect hosts from viral infection. Hepatitis E (HE) is an acute fulminant hepatitis in adults that has particularly high mortality in pregnant women. At this point in time, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment that is effective against the infectious agent, HEV. The nonstructural polyprotein region possesses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is responsible for the replication of the viral RNA genome. RdRp is therefore regarded as one of the most attractive candidates for RNA interference (RNAi). In the present study, the high efficiency and specificity of siRNA were evaluated by Real-Time quantitative PCR and Western blot assays. Protective effects against HEV infection were achieved in A549 cells and in piglets. In piglets treated with a shRNA-RdRp-1 expression plasmid prior to HEV inoculation, HEV antigens were significantly reduced in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, and the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TBIL) were clearly decreased. These results suggested that RNAi is a potentially effective antiviral strategy against HEV replication and infection.",

However, earlier evidence has documented that, despite the presence of antibodies to HEV capsid protein, HEV is still capable of causing infection (Panda et al., 1995; Yarbough, 1999) . Moreover, although vaccine-induced antibody might attenuate HEV infection, it may not prevent virus excretion in the feces (Panda et al., 1995) . The reasons are that the protective neutralizing antibodies either do not develop or are only short-lived (Jameel, 1999; Yarbough, 1999) . Recently, a purified polypeptide vaccine has been produced in insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing a truncated HEV genomic sequence encoding the capsid antigen, and has completed a phase 3 trial (Abreu, 2007; Krawczynski, 2007; Mushahwar, 2008; Shrestha et al., 2007) . However, the safety and efficacy of this vaccine is doubtful (Tacke and Trautwein, 2007) . First of all, the subjects were exclusively male, and it is pregnant women infected with HEV who have the highest mortality; secondly, the inconsistent data in humans and in rhesus monkeys (Krawczynski, 2007; Tacke and Trautwein, 2007) and finally, pigs can still suffer from HEV within 4-7 days post-infection, can transmit the virus as early as the first week post-infection and can continue to do so for at least several weeks (Halbur et al., 2001) . However, the current vaccines cannot provide complete protection prior to 6 months (Shrestha et al., 2007) . Thus, it is urgent to develop a more effective and safer therapeutic strategy for HEV control.",

Because of this, RdRp may prove to be the best target and best timed strategy for suppression of HEV replication by RNA interference. As an antiviral therapy tool, RNA interference has great promise (Kumar et al., 2008; Lupberger et al., 2008; Ni et al., 2005) and represents a realistic approach for suppressing recalcitrant viral infections such as those induced by HEV.",

In addition, HEV antigens were obviously reduced in the liver, spleen, and kidney of these piglets, as were activities of ALT, AST and the level of TBIL. This clear reduction in in vivo infection symptoms is a strong indication of the potential usefulness of the RNAi approach as an alternative to the relatively unsuccessful vaccination approaches that have been attempted previously.",
