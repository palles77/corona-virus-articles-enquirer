Respiratory pathogens can cause serious outbreaks of acute pneumonia in neonatal, weaned, and growing calves. Chronic infection leads to debilitation, decreased performance, and culling in older animals. The means to enhance effective and noninjurious immune responses are needed because of the high incidence of pneumonia in cattle, ubiquity of respiratory pathogens, the increasing frequency of antibiotic resistance, and the general expectation by consumers for producers to use antibiotics less frequently. The lung has a wide array of both innate and adaptive immune responses to airborne particulates, vapors, and microbial pathogens. Vaccines can effectively enhance resistance to some pathogens, but not all. More recently, additional attention has been given to innate immune responses and methods/regimens that increase innate immune activity. Despite advances in managerial practices, vaccines, and clinical therapies, pneumonia remains a widespread problem and methods to enhance host resistance to pathogen colonization and pneumonia are needed.",

The gel layer of the ASL is composed of mucin glycoproteins and proteoglycans secreted by goblet cells and submucosal glands. The amount of this layer can increase with chronic inflammatory conditions, allergic conditions, and cholinergic stimulation. The mucin glycoproteins are either tethered to the apical membrane of the subjacent epithelial cell or secreted. The protein backbone of the mucin glycoproteins encoded by MUC genes contain repeating serine and threonine amino acids that form O-linkages with oligosaccharides. In humans, MUC1 and MUC4 (and also MUC 11, 13, 15, and 20) proteins are associated with the apical surface, whereas MUC5AC is secreted from goblet cells and MUC5B is secreted from mucous cells of submucosal glands. 5 Variations of MUC gene expression change with inflammation and lung injury. MUC proteins serve as receptors and signaling molecules and can bind bacteria. For example, MUC1 is a receptor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellin protein, activates Src tyrosine kinases, and activates phospholipase C and protein kinase C. MUC7 is a non-gelforming secreted mucin. The ASL contains numerous molecules that mediate antimicrobial as well as proand anti-inflammatory activity, immunomodulation, and wound healing. 6 The osmotic gradient is maintained by sodium and chloride levels regulated by sodium and chloride transport pumps and channels, which allows proper protein, enzyme, and peptide activity. The presence and activity of some of these, such as lactoferrin and lysozyme have been known for many years. Lactoferrin binds and sequesters iron from microbial agents, whereas lysozyme can disrupt membranes of bacteria. Additional components of the ASL have been indentified in cattle and other species and increasingly appreciated for the immune and immunomodulatory role. These include antimicrobial peptides such as defensins, cathelicidins, and larger proteins. 7 There are 3 major subclassifications of defensins and 2, the alpha and beta defensins, are present in cattle.",

TAP and LAP are produced by respiratory epithelia and TAP has the highest level of expression. In fact, TAP was the first mammalian defensin identified, being isolated and cloned by Gill Diamond and colleagues in 1991. 8 Both TAP, LAP, and other defensins can form pores in the membranes of bacteria, enveloped viruses, and other microbial agents resulting in rapid lysis. Beta defensins have numerous other activities that range from exacerbating the acute inflammatory reaction by triggering histamine release from mast cells, to triggering the adaptive immune response through their chemotactic properties to dendritic cells, to inducing wound healing via their mitogenic function in epithelial cells. Cercropin is an antimicrobial peptide from insects that, when delivered by vector to bovine mucosa, reduces colonization by Mannheimia haemoyltica. 9 Bovine neutrophils have numerous alpha defensins as well; however, these are produced in neutrophils and are present in the ASL only after neutrophil recruitment and degranulation. Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides are also produced in neutrophils and can be released by lung epithelia; however, epithelial expression is apparently low and limited. Airway epithelial cells also produce RNAase 7, an RNA helicase with antimicrobial properties; however, the expression levels of RNAase in cattle are not known. Bovine neutrophils express 13 defensins that are released upon degranulation and contribute to microbial killing and the acute inflammatory reaction. Binding of defensins and other antimicrobial peptides to host membranes is limited, presumably because of the higher cholesterol content of mammalian cells and, thus, autotoxicity by these peptides is not a feature of the their activity.",

Once activated, the macrophages release cytokines, chemokines, and other soluble mediators that stimulate an inflammatory and/or immune response. Cells lining alveoli (type I pneumocytes) are covered by a layer of surfactant, composed of phosphatidylcholine and other phospholipids, which prevents alveolar collapse by its effect on apical membrane surface tension. Surfactant is secreted by airway type II cells and Clara cells along with surfactant proteins. Intracellularly, surfactant proteins B and C are associated with surfactant and maintain surfactant folding/structure until release. Surfactant proteins A and D are also associated with surfactant and released by pseudostratified ciliated, type II, and Clara cells into the airway and/or alveolar lumen and have very potent antimicrobial and immunomodulatory roles. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) can bind and inactivate microbial agents. Both of these proteins have a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that binds to mannose residues of microbial pathogens. Once bound, the pathogen and surfactant protein complex can aggregate and be taken up by alveolar macrophages. This is well documented for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in humans, 6 and individual altered surfactant proteins A and/or D attributable to nucleotide polymorphisms have increased numbers of RSV infection and increased severity. Once released, SP-A can activate macrophages and enhance macrophage uptake and killing of microbial pathogens. In addition, SP-A present within the alveolar lumen liquid can be taken up by the pulmonary lymphatic drainage system and enter the blood. Increased levels of SP-A in blood is associated with pneumonia and could be a useful biomarker of pneumonia severity.",

Intervening within the pseudostratified ciliated epithelium are goblet cells that release mucin products discussed earlier and also submucosal glands. In the ethmoid region, additional nerve sensory fibers enter the respiratory epithelia and mediate olfactory sensations. Pseudostratified ciliated epithelia, along with submucosal glands, line the frontal and ethmoid sinuses, trachea, and bronchi. Lung bronchiole mucosa has a thinner epithelial layer (1 celllayer thick) lined by both type II and Clara cells (see Fig. 1 ). Both cell types produce surfactant and surfactant proteins and can serve as progenitor cells; type II cells are progenitors for other type II cells and type I cells that line lung alveoli. Clara cells produce daughter cells that can be Clara cells or type II cells. Clara cells also express Innate Immunology of Bovine Respiratory Disease mixed function oxidases (cytochrome p450 isoenzymes such as CYP1A1 and CYP1A2) that detoxify inhaled toxins and/or toxins that are spread hematogenously. This is a beneficial feature for some toxins; however, for others, such as 3-methyl indole (3 MI), a toxic metabolite, 3-methylindololamine is formed that causes Clara and airway epithelial cell injury and necrosis. With loss of these cells, there is concomitant loss of the epithelial barrier and the overlying air-surface liquid containing antimicrobial factors. The 3 MI is present in certain feedstuffs such as foggage, rape, and kale. Clara cells also produce Clara cell secretory protein 10 (CC10). CC10 is an important, yet subtle, immunomodulator of lung physiology, influencing synthesis, secretion, and function of molecules such as phospholipase A2, interferon gamma, and locally produced IgA.

Microbial agents produce a number of conserved molecular patterns, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that include substances such as teichoic acid from gram-positive bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria, cytokine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) DNA, singleand double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), flaggelin, fungal zymosan, and lipopeptides from mycobacteria. Major pathogens of cattle, Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1; infectious bovine rhinotracheitis), parainfluenza virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVD), all produce some type of PAMP that are recognized by epithelia, alveolar macrophages, and intravascular macrophages. Intravascular macrophages are macrophages within the small capillaries of alveolar walls, attached to the underlying endothelial cells that are very active in metabolic generation of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. With acute inflammation, neutrophils also recognize PAMPs, and with adaptive immune responses, the various lung dendritic cells (DCs), including plasmcytoid DCs, natural killer (NK) cells, NK T cells, alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cells, and B cells, all interact with microbial PAMPs.",

Extracellular PRRs include LPS binding protein, mannan-binding lectins such as ficolin and collectins, and also C-reactive protein and serum amyloid protein. In swine, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in these mannan-binding lectin C are associated with increased respiratory disease. 10 Cell surface PRR on respiratory epithelia include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are transmembrane receptors that have outer leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and cytoplasmic Tll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor homology domains that transmit signals to the nucleus once the outer LRR are activated by PAMPs. The TLR activate nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B or the interferon regulatory factors (IRF)-3 and -7. Cattle have 10 TLRs that have specific and sometimes overlapping PAMP affinities. In short, TLR 1 has affinity for triacyl lipopeptide of mycobacteria; TLR 2 has affinity for peptidoglycans of gram-positive organisms and lipoarbinomannan of mycobacteria and zymosan of fungi; TLR 3 has affinity for dsRNA; TLR 4 has affinity for LPS; TLR 5 has affinity for flagellin; TLR 6 has affinity for diacyl lipopeptides of mycoplasma; TLR 7 and 8 have affinity for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA); TLR 9 has affinity for CpG; and TLR 10 is not yet fully assessed. As indicated, several TLRs 1,2,5-9 signal through MyD88, which leads to NF-kappa B activity and inflammatory reactions, whereas other TLRs 3 are MyD88 independent (signaling through TRIF/TRAF) and induce IRF-3 and -7 and type I interferon genes. TLR 4 can signal through MyD88 or TRIF/TRAF, depending on the stimulus. LPS, a bacterial component of Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida, first binds LPS binding protein, soluble CD14, and the TLR 4 cofactor MD2 before fully activated TLR 4. TLR 4 is also bound by the F protein of RSV.",

This fluid contains dilute microbial agents and toxins physically, and contains numerous molecules with protective immune function such as complement, hydrolytic enzymes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, collectins, acute phase proteins, and others. Endothelial cells also release inflammatory mediators and express adhesion molecules that mediate passage of leukocytes into sites of infection/injury. Neutrophils internalize microbial agents, foreign substances, and other particulates, release their granule contents, and upon death release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) composed of DNA, histones, and antimicrobial peptides (alpha defensins) that entrap microbes. NK cells do not require previous antigenic exposure to kill virus-infected cells. They express CD161 and CD56 and are activated by interferon and macrophage cytokines to produce interferon gamma and release perforin to kill virus-infected cells. In many species, activation of macrophages occurs in a classical, proinflammatory cell-mediated Th1-type response induced by interferon gamma and TNF; an alternative Th2type response induced by IL-4, and an anti-inflammatory, regulatory response induced by IL-10. In cattle, however, the Th1/Th2 paradiagm is not as clearly distinct, functionally, as in other species. Despite this, alveolar and intravascular macrophages of the bovine do function in generation of cell-mediated, humoral, and regulatory (inhibitory) responses. In allergic (Th2-type) conditions, eosinophilic and mast cell infiltration occurs with release of granule content.

Because of the lack of collateral ventilation, atelectasis occurs readily and these areas of lung remain consolidated and lack functional gaseous exchange.

Clearly, there is antigen exposure in the lung airways that triggers differentiation, maturation, and responses by these cells that have a kinetic progression with time.

More recently, additional components of colostrum appear to influence the development and activity of the neonatal calf immune system. Maternal colostral leukocytes reduce CD11a1 lymphocytes in neonatal calf blood and these calves have higher CD25-, CD26-, and MHC I-expressing lymphocytes. Thus, maternal colostral leukocytes accelerate fetal lymphocyte development. 19 Proinflammatory cytokines are also present in colostrum. IL-beta, IL-6, TNF alpha, and IFN gamma are significantly increased in colostrum but reduced to zero or nearly zero by day 5 of lactation. The high colostral levels of these cytokines correspond to increased levels in the serum of neonatal calves. 20 Serum cytokine levels of IL-1 beta, IL-1 alpha, TNF alpha, IL-6, and IFN gamma peak at 12-24 hours after birth and progressively decrease to zero or near zero by day 21. One study has shown high levels of IL-18 in colostrum and increased serum levels of IL-18 in neonates by 6 hours post colostral ingestion. 21 The increased colostral cytokines appear to trigger neutrophil function, as colostral whey enhances neutrophil functional assays (cytochrome C reduction and iodination). 22 This finding suggests that the colostral cytokines are important for neutrophil ''readiness'' in newborn animals.

The adaptive responses are contingent upon antigen recognition, antigen processing and presentation by dendritic cells, and involvement of gamma/delta T cells and alpha/beta (CD 4 and CD8) cells. Of these, gamma/delta T cells of cattle are of special interest for at least two reasons. First, newborn calves have an unusually high number of circulating gamma/delta T cells and second, gamma/delta T cells of ruminants express WC-1 antigen. Gamma/delta T cells account for 60% of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in young calves. WC11 gamma/delta T cells are considered an inflammatory population, whereas CD1-gamma/delta T cells are regulatory with myeloid cell features. Within the WC11 phenotype are WC1.11 and WC1.21 subsets that differ in their IFN gamma production and proliferative responses to stimuli. 24, 25 The role of WC protein is not fully understood but it may be a homolog of CD4 and CD8 antigens on alpha/beta T cells by regulating gamma/delta T-cell responses or transmission of signals from the outside into the cell. 26 It is possible that WC protein binds microbial PAMPs similar to other proteins with similarities to WC.",

The mean fatal disease onset was 32.6 days and mean treatment interval was 29 days, mean number of antibiotic treatments were 2.6 days, and mean day of death was 61.8 days. All of the agents listed at the beginning of this article were isolated from the cattle. These agents were correlated with mortality, treatment, lesion, and association with other agents. Also correlated were the type of lesions with mortality, treatment, and infectious agent. Interestingly, along with BVDV-1a and 2b, BVDV-1b was identified in fatal cases and this was considered noteworthy because most current BVDV vaccines contain BVDV-1a and 2b but not BVDV1b. The work also identified BVDV-2b for the first time. This study confirms the continued presence of and damage caused by these microbial agents in 2009. Thus, despite advancements in managerial practices, vaccine development, antimicrobial agents, medicine, and molecular diagnostics, each of these agents remains a significant concern.",

Cattle have anatomic features such as reduced collateral ventilation that reduce the effectiveness of the innate immune response and current managerial practices sometimes weaken the innate immune response.

            "text": ". The antimicrobial activity of the ASL is becoming increasinglyFig. 1. Schematic illustration of the bovine respiratory immune system emphasizing the innate components. Depicted are immune systems within 3 main regions of the respiratory tract: the airways (upper respiratory tract to the bronchi), bronchiole, and alveoli. Airway: Conducting airways are lined by pseudostratified ciliated epithelium that transports the air-surface liquid (ASL) anteriorly toward the pharynx or nares. ASL is produced by secretion products from goblet cells and submucosal glands. Within the ASL are mucins (see text), as well as antimicrobial proteins (eg, lysozyme, lactoferrin, surfactant proteins A and D, SLPI, PLUNC, and others) and antimicrobial peptides (defensins and RNAase 7), which are produced by ciliated epithelial cells. The oxidative defense system (ODS) is composed of lactoperoxidase (LPO) produced by submucosal glands, dual function oxidases 1 and 2 (Duox1 and Duox2) produced by epithelia, and thiocyanate (SCN-) transport proteins produced by epithelia. Duox1 and 2 produce hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), which, in the presence of SCN-, is converted to OSCN-, which has potent antimicrobial activity. Bronchioles: Bronchioles are lined by Clara and Type II cells, both of which also produce antimicrobial proteins and peptides. Clara cells also produce CC10, an immunomodulatory protein, and express cytochrome P450 enzymes that biometabolize toxins. With injury, Type II and Clara cells proliferate and replace damaged cells. Alveoli: Type I pneumocytes line the alveolar lumen and are covered by surfactant phospholipids that are admixed with surfactant proteins, antimicrobial proteins, and antimicrobial peptides. With injury, Type I pneumocytes are replaced by Type II cells, which then differentiate into Type I cells. Effector cells: Neutrophils, alveolar and intravascular macrophages, alpha/beta T (CD4 and CD8) cells, and gamma/delta T cells along with B, NK, and dendritic cells are effector cells present along the respiratory tree for induction of adaptive immune responses. With inflammation, neutrophils and macrophages are present in the alveolar lumen, bronchioles, and airways. Other immune responses such as pattern recognition receptors as well as cytokine, interferon, and chemokine responses are not included in this figure.",
