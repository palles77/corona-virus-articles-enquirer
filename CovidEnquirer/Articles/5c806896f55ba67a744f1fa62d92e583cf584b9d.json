Air travel has been cited as a major influence on changing leisure activities, yet even a novice can recognize the opportunities for sea and water based vacations using ships as floating resorts. According to Day and McRae (2001) , a cruise ship provides easy access to some of the world's most popular destinations, and this simple statement holds the key to the current successes that the industry enjoys. This can be exemplified by examining Table 1 .1 and completing the task that is described.",

The range of cruise types has expanded to include opportunities for all sorts of people. In this way, cruising can be both socially inclusive and exclusive: families can be catered to as a specialty market, as can single tourists, conference delegates, older travelers, active tourists, groups, etc.-the list is endless. Ward recognizes that this type of vacation is appealing to older customers but also notes that the average age of first time cruisers is now well under 40.

The ship as a destination with sophisticated on-board facilities and a much-enhanced product is linked to economies of scale achieved through the construction of larger vessels (Kontes, 2003) . This aspect of cruising has captured the public's attention, and the implications are important in terms of political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental issues. These aspects will be examined later in this book. However, even in basic terms, the sizes of cruise ships provide an interesting comparison (Figure 1.1) .",

The Cunard Line's Queen Elizabeth 2 measures 70,327 GRT (Gross Registered Tonnage) and the Queen Mary 2, which started cruising in January 2004, is 150,000 GRT. Princess Cruises' Grand Princess, weighs in at 108,806 GRT, while Hebridean Island Cruises' Hebridean Princess is 2,112 GRT. Royal Caribbean's Freedom of the Sea (158,000 GRT) is due to embark on her inaugural cruise in April 2006. Scale varies depending on purpose. Large vessels, such as the Eagle-class ships that were discussed previously, accommodate larger numbers and can provide opportunities for greater diversity on board. Smaller vessels can be more intimate and provide access to ports that larger ships cannot visit because of the depth of the ship's keel, the length of the vessel, or the constraints of maneuverability at the destination. Certain ratios (crew to customers, customer space per customer, and size of cabin to public areas) all play a part depending on the type of cruise tourist. The passenger/ space ratio is calculated by dividing GRT by the maximum number of passengers to provide a number that defines cubic space per passenger. Currently the QM2 has one of the highest ratios of space to passengers at just over 57 (150,000 GRT divided by 2,620 passengers). At the other end of the scale, budget vessels might be as low as 28. Ratios of crew to passengers tend to reflect a 2:1 ratio for premium lines and 1.5:1 for luxury vessels.",

The company describes the concept as being \"the ultimate getaway for tired executives, adventure seekers and self-described escapists\" (Windstar 2003). The vessel 'Windstar' shares her name with the company. She is one of three of the company's ships designed to cruise a range of destinations including the Lesser Antilles, Virgin Islands, Florida Keys and Bahamas in the Caribbean, and Western and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, the Greek and Turkish Isles, the Baltic and Northern Europe. Customers are described as having an average age of 51 for past guests and 50 for new guests, with an average annual income of $120,000 and over. Windstar customers are said by the company to be \"active and adventurous, sophisticated travelers ranging from their 20s to 80s\" (Windstar, 2003) . Typically, Windstar customers may be business owners, executives, retirees, honeymooners, stockbrokers, lawyers, engineers, entrepreneurs, artists, authors, researchers, doctors, or educators. According to , the ship's age creates both a luxury ambience through its use of materials and overall decor and, in the cabins, a more traditional appearance. The overall cruising experience is reported on positively. The experience is said to be relaxing, informal, and stress free. A range of activities, including wind surfing, skiing, scuba, and snorkeling, is available. The ship boasts a casino, a library, a small swimming pool (described by Ward as a \"dip pool\"), a shop, an infirmary, a piano bar, and a \"chic and elegant\" restaurant (called \"the Restaurant\"). Cabins are fitted out with television, videocassette and CD players, personal safe, refrigerator, mini-bar, and international directdial phones, as well as private bathrooms with shower toiletries, hair dryer, vanity, and plush robes.",

On one hand the numbers of traditional cruise customers appear to be both stable and increasing, yet there is clear evidence to suggest that real growth is likely to occur in emerging markets such as that described in the case study on the Ocean Village. In reality, cruise companies are continuing the trend that is presented in Table 1 .5-that is, companies adapt to emerging situations and seek new opportunities to take advantage of trading conditions.",

The future is predicted to be good, and yet the last decade has been punctuated by a series of acquisitions and mergers (Bjornsen, 2003) that appear to indicate a market subject to constant upheaval and change. In this environment it is tempting to forecast more of the same for the medium term but that would ignore salient issues that have emerged. First, the largest companies, the Carnival Corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, and Star Cruises/NCL, possess among them considerable purchasing power. Second, new ships create a wave effect, releasing into the market older vessels that can then be used by emerging or newly formed cruise companies. Third, cruise companies have learned to be wary of market conditions and unforeseen events. Public opinion of globalization, the incidence of terrorism, and worldwide threats caused by health problems such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China in 2002, can influence customers' decision making.",

As Moutinho (2000) states, branding for tourism organizations is perceived to present significant strategic advantages. Thus, a brand name can hold connotations about a corporation or a company or a cruise ship. The brand may be more than a name in that a design or symbol can also be selected to represent the brand values: P&O Cruises uses a familiar nautical flag. In addition, historical events add a recognition factor to some \"famous\" names. Examples include the \"White Star\" brand that is utilized by Cunard to identify their training provision on board the \"White Star Academy\" (see Chapter 10 for more information). Cruise ships lend themselves very well to the process of branding. Passengers engage with the \"product,\" or the cruise, in a series of complex ways that enhance the opportunity to develop brand loyalty. This process extends throughout the cruise experience, from considering the glossy images on a cruise brochure and booking a cruise to the point of embarkation, when the customer first experiences the scale and impressiveness of the ship in port, through to consideration of life on board and then to departure and disembarkation. This form of vacation creates a unique relationship between passenger and ship, passenger and cruise, and passenger and brand.Branding is important for targeting new markets, engendering repeat business, highlighting brand recognition, defining a firm's strategic approach to marketing and operations, and critically, establishing loyalty (Moutinho, 2000) . Laws (1997) identifies the advantages that accrue to the major corporations, in terms of resources and marketing strength, which means they can afford to underpin brand development with impactful brand awareness campaigns, focusing in turn on the specific market segment that is deemed to be the target market for specific brand identities.",

In many ways the industry reflects strengths that have emerged as a result of the relentless growth connected with globalization. Powerful corporations exist within the industry, and they have the resources to keep pace with the constant demands that are required when investing in new ships. Countries that benefit from globalization become wealthier, and as a result large swathes of their populations are better able to purchase cruise vacations. Increasingly, sustained growth means there is greater of confidence and that in turn there is increased innovation in developing cruise products. Demand coupled with positive publicity appears to create greater demand as the potential cruising population develops more of a taste for this type of vacation. The industry also benefits from repeat business and a high degree of customer loyalty.This chapter has examined the elements of cruising to highlight critical factors connected to its current status as a significant and growing part of the tourism and leisure field. Historic trends in cruising have been reflected upon in order to examine the way that changes have occurred over time and to understand why these changes have come about. A number of cruise brands are considered so as to contrast services and styles in order to reveal different types of cruises. This allows further discussion to be developed about the cruise brands themselves so as to encourage an understanding of the nature of this complex market.",
