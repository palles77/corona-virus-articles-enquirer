Among other potential pathogens, we 55 identified one novel orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Nyangole virus, from the blood of a 56 child diagnosed with malaria and pneumonia, and Bwamba orthobunyavirus in the nasopharynx 57 of a child with rash and sepsis. We also identified two novel human rhinovirus C species. 58 59 Conclusions: This exploratory pilot study demonstrates the utility of mNGS and the IDseq 60 platform for defining the molecular landscape of febrile infectious diseases in resource limited 61 areas. These methods, supported by a robust data analysis and sharing platform, offer a new tool 62 for the surveillance, diagnosis, and ultimately treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. 63",

In particular, the lack of identification of bacteremia in study 327 subjects may have been due to a relative paucity of severe illness, compared to that in other 328 studies, in our cohort of admitted children.

Much more may be learned by linking rigorous clinical 331 evaluation with mNGS results, and thereby more comprehensively assessing associations 332 between clinical syndromes and specific pathogens.

            "text": "febrile child in sub-Saharan Africa may have a mild self-resolving viral infection or may be 69 suffering bacterial sepsis or malaria-major causes of disability and death [1], [2]. In the past, 70 febrile illness in children under five years of age in most of Africa was treated empirically as 71 malaria due to the limited availability of diagnostics and the risk of untreated malaria progressing 72 to life-threatening illness. This strategy changed with new guidelines from the World Health 73 Organization (WHO) in 2010, which recommend limiting malaria therapy to those with a 74 confirmed diagnosis [3]. However, standard recommendations for management of febrile 75 children who do not have malaria are lacking. Increased knowledge about the prevalence of non-76 malarial pathogens associated with fever is needed to inform management strategies for febrile 77 children who do not have malaria [2]. 78 79 Advances in genome sequencing hold promise for addressing global infectious disease 80 challenges by enabling unbiased detection of microbial pathogens without requirement for the 81 extensive infrastructure of modern microbiology laboratories [4], [5]. Although sequence-based 82 diagnostics have not yet replaced most traditional microbiological assays, this situation is 83 rapidly changing, as sequence-based strategies are incorporated for clinical care [6]-[10], and 84 costs have declined dramatically over the past decade [11]. A significant roadblock toward 85 implementation of sequence-based diagnostics is the extensive computational requirements and 86 associated with P. falciparum. Additionally, GB virus C and torque teno virus (TTV)of 90 NP swabs was collected and processed; 52 (57.7%) of these were from 141 patients with admission diagnoses of pneumonia, respiratory tract infection, or bronchiolitis 142 (Table 1). Chest imaging was not available to further assess these diagnoses. 73 NP samples 143 (81.1%) contained at least 1 viral species (Figure 2B). HRV-A and HRV-C were the most 144 prevalent, followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cytomegalovirus (HHV-5), influenza 145 B, and coronavirus OC43. Other respiratory viruses identified included influenza A, HRV-B, 146 adenovirus B, 3 human parainfluenza virus types, metapneumovirus, coronavirus NL63, avian 147 coronavirus, coxsackievirus A2, coxsackievirus B2, polyomaviruses (KI), HHV-6 and HHV-7. 148 Other viruses identified that are not typically considered respiratory pathogens included hepatitis 149 A virus, hepatitis B virus, parvovirus B19, mamastrovirus 1, Bwamba orthobunyavirus, 150 betapapillomavirus 1, and rotavirus. Additionally, TTV was found in 49 (54.4%) NP swab 151 samples, including one sample with both gemykrogvirus and TTV. For 26 (28.8%) patients, 152 mNGS identified respiratory viral co-infections, most commonly with HRV-C (n=11) and HRV-153 A (n=5) (Table S1b). The same microbial species was identified in the NP swab and serum 154 samples in 6 patients, one each with HRV-A, HRV-C, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, 155 rotavirus A, and parvovirus B19. 156 comprised 79% of all microbial reads-Moraxella (39.4%), Haemophilus (16.7%), 159 Streptococcus (16.2%), and Corynebacterium (6.6%). Given that diversity loss in the microbial 160 flora in lower respiratory tract samples correlates with pneumonia [14], [15], we compared the 161 Simpsons diversity Index (SDI) in patients with and without clinical diagnoses of respiratory 162 tract infection. We found no significant difference between patients with (mean SDI = 0.51, IQR 163 0.37 -0.65) or without (mean SDI = 0.51, IQR = 0.42 -0.65; p = 0.86) diagnoses of respiratory 164 infection (Figure S1). This finding is consistent with a growing body of work demonstrating that 165 microbial composition of the nasopharynx may not correlate well with that of the lower 166 respiratory tract in patients with pneumonia [16]-[18]. 167 168 mNGS of stool 169 Among the 10 stool samples collected and sequenced, pathogens were detected in 9/10 170 samples. The three most common pathogens identified were rotavirus A (50%), Cryptosporidium 171 (40%), and human parechovirus (40%). Seven children had co-infections: two rotavirus A and 172 human parechovirus, and one each rotavirus A and Cryptosporidium, rotavirus A and 173 enterovirus, Cryptosporidium and human parechovirus, Cryptosporidium and Norwalk virus, and 174Giardia and human parechovirus. Five samples also had Blastocystis hominis, one patient admitted with a clinical diagnosis of malaria and pneumonia 179 contained a novel orthobunyavirus in addition to P. falciparum. Assembly of a draft genome and 180 comparison with existing orthobunyavirus genomes indicated that this draft sequence includes 181 97.5%, 100% and 91% of the L, M, and S coding regions, respectively(Fig 3). Average read 182 coverage across the segments was 86-fold. Phylogenetic comparison showed that the novel virus 183 was significantly divergent from known orthobunyaviruses, sharing 44.9-55.1% amino acid 184 identity with the closest known relatives, Calchaqui virus, Kaeng Khoi virus, and Anopheles A 185 virus(Figure 3, Figures S3a-c",

IDseq scripts and user instructions are 393 available at https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-dag and the graphical user interface web 394 application for sample upload is available at https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-web. 395 IDseq is conceptually based on previously implemented platforms [5], [31], [32], but is 396 optimized for scalable Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud deployment. Bioinformatics data 397 processing jobs are carried out on demand as Docker containers using AWS Batch. Alignments 398 to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database are executed on 399 dedicated auto scaling groups (ASG) of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, with 400 the number of server instances varied with job load. Fast downloads of the NCBI database from 401 the Amazon Simple Storage Service to each new server instance are enabled by the open-source 402 tool s3mi (https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/s3mi). Initial alignment and removal of reads 403 derived from the human genome is performed using the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a 404 Reference (STAR) algorithm [55]. Low-quality reads, duplicates, and low-complexity reads are 405 then removed using the Paired-Read Iterative Contig Extension (PRICE) computational package 406 [56], the CD-HIT-DUP tool [57], and a filter based on the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) 407 compression score, respectively. A second round of human read filtering is carried out using 408 removed, given the high likelihood that such residual reads are of human 412 origin. The relative abundance of microbial taxa is calculated based on reads per million (rpM) 413 mapped at the genus level. To distinguish potential pathogens from ubiquitous environmental 414 agents including commensal flora, a Z-score is calculated for the value observed for each genus 415 relative to a background of healthy and no-template control samples [31].

Run times may vary depending on 421 demand, percentage of non-host sequence, and autoscaling parameters. 422 423For this study we report species greater than 0 rpM and Z-scores detected in the serum, 424 stool, and NP samples. Consistent with previous studies, low levels of \"index bleed through\" or 425 \"barcode hopping\" (assignment of sequencing reads to the wrong barcode/index) was observed 426 within the non-templated control samples[61]. To prevent mis-assignment, when a microbe 427 found in more than one sample, it was reported only when present at levels at least four times the 428 level of mis-assigned reads observed in the control samples.

The 207Picornavirus Working Group has established that novel HRV-Cs should exhibit at least 13% 208 nucleotide sequence divergence in the VP1 gene [20], qualifying these two isolates as novel. 209We assembled influenza B genome segments (>500bp, mean-coverage: 41-fold) from six 212 of seven samples containing influenza B virus (one sample had insufficient sequencing reads). 213The viruses assembled were >99% similar to each other and >99% identical to the 214 B/Massachusetts/02/2012-like virus included in the vaccine recommended by WHO for the 215 Antimicrobial resistance profiling in the nasopharynx and stool 219We employed Short Read Sequencing Typing (SRST2) to survey the resistance gene 220 landscape of our metagenomic dataset[21]. In total, 86% of patients were found to harbor 221 molecular evidence of resistant organisms in their nasopharynx and 50% in their stool. For both 222 stool and NP swabs, genes conferring resistance to beta lactams were the most abundant, and 223 included ampC (n=2), which confers resistance to first through third generation cephalosporins, 224and IMP-1 (n=1) which confers broad spectrum resistance that includes carbapenems. In 225 macrolides/lincosamides, phenicols, sulfas, and tetracyclines were identified (Figure S2). 227 The clinical management of children with fever is challenging in Africa, where clinicians 230 often have access only to malaria diagnostics. A better understanding of the microbial agents 231 causing fever in African children is needed to inform the development of better diagnostic 232 algorithms and therapeutic guidelines. To address this unmet need, we developed and deployed 233 IDseq in combination with unbiased mNGS to characterize the etiology of fever in Ugandan 234 children admitted to a rural district hospital. We identified a wide range of pathogens in these 235 Other studies evaluating causes of febrile illness in African children have focused on a 238 limited number of pathogens [22]-[25]. In a study of febrile children in Tanzania utilizing rapid 239 diagnostic tests, serologic tests, culture, and molecular tests, viruses accounted for 51% of lower 240 respiratory infections, 78% of systemic infections, and 100% of nasopharyngeal infections. 241 Additionally, 9% of the children had malaria and 4.2% bacteremia [26]. In febrile children in 242 Kenya, reported pathogens were spotted fever group Rickettsia (22.4%), influenza (22.4%), 243 and typhus group Rickettsiae (1.0%) [27], [28]. Another study reported bacteremia in 19.1% of 246 children admitted to a referral hospital in Uganda [29]. Additionally, in patients (across all age 247 East Africa, and 12.4% in West Africa [30]. 249Traditional pathogen detection methods, including culture, serology, and pathogen 251 directed molecular methods, are logistically challenging in resource limited settings due to the 252 need for extensive microbiology laboratory infrastructure. Unbiased sequencing approaches are 253 designed to identify all potential pathogens, but have been limited by high cost. The costs of 254 deep sequencing are rapidly decreasing, but the analysis of mNGS data necessarily incurs an 255 increasingly large cost, as the available genomic databases to be searched continue to expand. 256Other major challenges for mNGS approaches include the need for better control datasets, in 257 particular to enable discrimination of contaminants and commensal organisms from true 258 pathogens.

Overall, we detected at least three HRV-A and eight HRV-C 280 types co-circulating in Tororo District. Of note, during the same collection period, a lethal HRV-281 C outbreak was reported in chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, in western Uganda[43]. The 282 HRV-C reported in western Uganda was modestly related to an isolate observed in our study 283 wide spectrum of HRVs infects Ugandan children. In addition to HRV, we detected a spectrum 285 of other known respiratory viruses, including RSV, human parainfluenza viruses, human 286Diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of death in children in Africa[44]. 289Approximately 48% of febrile children in our study presented with diarrhea, but due to logistical 290 constraints stool specimens were available for only 10 cases. Rotavirus A, the leading cause of 291 pediatric diarrhea worldwide[45], was the most commonly identified pathogen in this cohort. 292Rotavirus vaccination, known to be highly effective, is yet to be implemented in Uganda, but the 293 B. hominis and several enteroviruses in stool specimens. Enteroviruses, HRV-C, and 295 mamastrovirus were also identified in the serum of three children with clinical diagnoses of 296 with P. falciparum in a child with clinical diagnoses of malaria and pneumonia.The virus was 301 surprisingly divergent from known viruses, with an average amino acid similarity of 51.6% to its 302 nearest known relatives including Calchaqui, Anopheles A and Kaeng Khoi viruses. Mosquitoes 303 have been proposed as a vector for Calchaqui and Anopheles A viruses; Kaeng Khoi virus has 304 been isolated from bedbugs [46]-[48]. Antibodies to these viruses have been detected in human 305 sera, but their role as human pathogens is uncertain [46]-[49]. While the depth of coverage of 306 Nyangole virus sequence in our patient suggests significant viremia, and other orthobunyaviruses 307 are responsible for severe human illnesses (e.g., California encephalitis virus, La Crosse virus, 308 Jamestown Canyon virus, and Cache Valley virus) [50], it is unknown whether the identified 309 virus was responsible for the presenting symptoms. 310 NP swab analysis identified another Orthobunyavirus, Bwamba virus, in a child admitted 312 with rash, sepsis and diarrhea. This virus has previously been described to cause fever in Uganda 313 [51]. Our identification of two orthobunyaviruses, including one novel virus, in a small sample 314 of febrile Ugandan children suggests that the landscape of previously unidentified viruses that 315 infect African children and potentially cause febrile illness, is significantly under explored. 316",

For NP and stool samples, because 433 the nasopharynx and intestines are normally colonized with commensal bacteria [62]-[65], only 434 non-bacterial species were reported. 435 Genome assembly, annotation and phylogenetic analysis: 437 To more comprehensively characterize the genomes of identified microbes PRICE [56] 438 and St. Petersburg genome assembler (SPAdes) [66] were used to de novo assemble short read 439 sequences into larger contiguous sequences (contigs). Assembled contigs were queried against 440 the NCBI nt database using BLAST to identify the closest related microbes. GenBank annotation 441 files from genome sequence records corresponding to the highest scoring alignments were used 442 to identify potential features within the de novo assembled genomes. Geneious v10.3.2 was used 443 to annotate newly assembled genomes. Reference genomes for multiple sequence alignments and 444 phylogenetic analyses were downloaded from NCBI. Multiple sequence alignments were 445 generated using ClustalW in MEGA v6.0 and the Geneious aligner in Geneious v10.3.2. 446 Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were generated using Geneious v10.3.2 and further assessed 447 using FigTree v1.4.3. Annotation of protein domains in the novel orthobunyaviruses was 448 performed using the InterPro webserver [67] as well as direct alignment against previously 449 known orthobunyaviruses. The TOPCONS webserver [68] was used for the identification of 450 transmembrane regions and signal peptides, and the NetNglyc 1.0 Server 451 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/) for the identification of glycosylation sites. 452 Evaluation of NP microbiome diversity: 454 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

SDI 458 was calculated in R using the Veganv2.4.4 package on genus-level reads per million values for 459 all microbes, including bacteria. A Wilcox Rank Sum test was used to evaluate differences in 460 SDI between patients in the two categories. 461Antimicrobial resistance gene identification in nasopharynx and stool: 463The SRST2 computational package was used to identify antimicrobial resistance genes 464 using the Argannot2 database as previously described[21]. We defined extended spectrum \u03b2-465 lactamase (ESBL) as a \u03b2-lactamase conferring resistance to the penicillins, first-, second-, and 466 third-generation cephalosporins including the gene classes proposed by Giske et al [69]. 467 Availability of data and code 469 All raw data have been deposited under Bioproject ID: PRJNA483304.
