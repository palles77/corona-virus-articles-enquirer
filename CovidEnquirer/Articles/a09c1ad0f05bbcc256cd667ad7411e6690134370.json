In January 2020, a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 occurred following the beginning of the largest annual migration in China known as the Spring Festival migration. Due to the geographic location of Wuhan and its role as a central transportation hub, number of cases of infection rose rapidly [7] . By February 11, 2020, over 60,000 cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were reported. [8] . Since January 20, 2020, when it was publicly announced that COVID-19 was human-to-human transmittable [9] [10] , the Chinese government took a series of unprecedented, austere measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. Public transportation was suspended in and out of the city of Wuhan, where the disease initially outbroke, and this was later extended to adjacent areas. [11] Other provinces followed suit and successively took precautionary actions in accordance with the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, including passenger body temperature surveillance at railway stations and airports, and restriction of large gatherings.

However, the inflow population people were largely Anhui natives, returning home for Chinese New Year.

These gatherings accelerated the local spread and generated cases where patients had no travel history to the epidemic focus [10] .

Under a novel infectious disease outbreak background, precautions should be taken to closely monitor the trend of population migration, and quick response should be made to deal with expected and unexpected population flow. For cities like Hefei, with predominant inflow of native population from the epidemic focus, restriction to gatherings would be a step of priority to contain infection considering both population migration and cultural factors.
