            "text": "Influenza infections are a public health concern accounting for more than 30 000 deaths and 100 000 hospitalizations annually. 1 The primary populations at risk for infection include young children, elderly adults, and immunocompromised subjects. During influenza outbreaks or pandemics, healthcare workers are at an elevated risk for acquiring influenza infection due to the prolonged periods of exposure to influenza viruses within healthcare settings. The mechanisms of influenza virus dissemination and transmission are poorly understood. Experimental studies have shown that influenza viruses can be transmitted via contact with respiratory secretions, large droplets, and aerosolized small particles \u2044 droplet nuclei. 2 Mucous membrane contact of large droplets expelled from the respiratory tract are thought to be the predominant mode by which influenza infection is transmitted, but small particle aerosols and droplet nuclei are also of concern due to the potential for prolonged airborne suspension. 3, 4 Given the epidemic potential and public health concern of newly emerging diseases such as avian influenza (H5N1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 5, 6 it is important to develop methods to study aerosolized viral particles. Such measures would not only enable improved monitoring and detection of viruses, but more importantly, would help prevent widespread transmission. To date, several bioaerosol samplers are available that use impaction or impinger sampling methodologies for viral aerosol detection. 7, 8 However, limitations exist within each of these methods such as poor collection efficiency, limited sampling time, and inability to separate particles based on size. Further complicating the study of viral aerosols is that in many environments where it would be desirable to sample for viral aerosols (e.g., hospitals, airports), the level of other biologically relevant particles such as bacteria, fungi, and pollens can also be very high.",

This bioaerosol sampler contains two microcentrifuge tubes and a back-up filter, which separate airborne particulates based on their aerodynamic diameter. 10 The first tube (T1) of the sampler collects particles that are greater than approximately 1.8 lm in diameter, while the second tube (T2) collects particles from 1.0 to 1.8 lm in diameter and the back-up filter (F) collects submicron particulates. Because the sample is deposited directly in microcentrifuge tubes, the sampler facilitates the direct processing of samples for downstream diagnostic applications such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The bioaerosol sampler potentially eliminates several limitations associated with other air sampling devices such as sample loss, contamination, and degradation. In this proof of concept study, we characterized the utility of the two-stage bioaerosol sampler for fractionating viral particles and separating them from other particulates.",

One milliliter of this solution was initially drawn for assay, and the remainder placed in a Collison single-jet nebulizer (BGI Incorporated, Waltham, MA, USA). The solution was aerosolized at 138 kPa (20 lbs \u2044 in 2 ) air pressure, passed through a diffusion drier (Model 3062; TSI Incorporated, Shoreview, MN, USA), and mixed with 26 l \u2044 minute dry filtered air. The dry aerosol then flowed into the top of the calm air chamber. To avoid possible degradation of the virus by ozone, an unavoidable by-product, the bipolar ionizer employed in earlier studies 10 was not used. Instead, all conducting lines and the settling chamber itself were metal and grounded. Previous tests with the calm air chamber indicated that these precautions were sufficient to avoid electrostatic aerosol deposition. 11 The concentration and size distribution of the diluted aerosol was recorded using an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS Model 3321; TSI), which drew air from a vertical probe placed at the same height as the bioaerosol sampler inlets.",

Bioaerosols vary in size, concentration, composition, and settling times. 3,17 An aerodynamic particle sizer was used to monitor the concentration and size distribution of the FluMist \u00d2 aerosol within the settling chamber. Using the bioaerosol sampler, it could be demonstrated that capture, recovery, and subsequent detection for each sampler stage (T1, T2, F) were consistent with the expected values based on particle size. As anticipated, qPCR results confirmed that a significant number of the aerosolized viral particles were localized within stages T2 and F. These results are in agreement with the sampler cutoff size of 1.0 and <1 lm for stages T2 and F, respectively.

In aerobiological studies using different viral strains, 18, 19 it was found that prolonged sampling periods resulted in decreased viral recovery.

Moreover, samples are directly processed within the respective tubes and further analyzed by different diagnostic methods including immunoassays or molecular detection techniques such as qPCR. Currently qPCR is the preferred methodology for the rapid and sensitive detection of viruses; 20 however, several limitations still exist. The sensitivity and specificity of qPCR detection is limited to the targeted template. In this study, primers and probes were designed to selectively amplify the HA and NA genes from strains H1N1 and H3N2, respectively. Interestingly, the results showed a considerable difference in the number of viral particles that were detected for strains H1N1 and H3N2. The FluMist \u00d2 vaccine is formulated so as to contain an equivalent concentration of each viral strain using the median culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assay 21 but does not account for non-viable viral particles. qPCR can detect viral cDNA from both viable and non-viable viral particles, and perhaps explain this discrepancy. As for the qPCR detection of strain B, erratic results were obtained. As qPCR detection was successful for both strains H1N1 and H3N2, this may not be due to the presence of inhibitors in the reaction but instead is more likely due to poor primer or probe design or the presence of secondary (10 7 ) and FluMist \u00d2 were co-aerosolized together into the calm air chamber.

Environmental bioaerosols vary considerably and may consist of a number of different microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Recent findings by Lindsley et al 10 demonstrated that the two-stage bioaerosol sampler was effective at collecting and separating aerosolized fungal spores and fragments. Results of the current study provide supporting evidence that the bioaerosol sampler is able to successfully recover and size-fractionate viral-laden aerosols. The culmination of these results suggests that the bioaerosol sampler would be an ideal air-sampling device for the aerobiological monitoring of various microorganisms within occupational environments. However, preliminary findings from a co-aerosolization study suggest fractionation of environmental samples may be more complex. Namely, an overall shift in the viral particle deposition in the presence of A. versicolor spores was observed. The shift in viral particle deposition may be attributed to the attachment of viral particles to A. versicolor spores. APS data (not shown) further suggest that particles adhere to one another. Given that the viral and spore-laden solution is pre-mixed prior to aerosolizing, it remains unclear as to whether the binding may occur before, during or after aerosolization within the calm-air settling chamber.
