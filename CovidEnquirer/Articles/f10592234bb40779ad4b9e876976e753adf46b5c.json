Selection of these tests and the availability of infrequently offered tests should be determined after discussions with key members of the medical staff and should be revised as patient care needs change. If the performance of infrequent, expensive, or sophisticated testing is shifted to an external laboratory, the microbiologist should ensure that timely transport and appropriate test procedures for these send-out tests are maintained so that test accuracy is not compromised. The microbiologist should provide the medical staff with a menu of the offered tests, including cutoff times for receipt of specimens and turnaround times for test results. Guidelines for collection of appropriate specimens, transport of the specimens to the testing site, and laboratory policies (e.g., limits on the number of specimens that can be submitted for a specific test, list of pathogens routinely sought in stool cultures) should be available. The test menu and guidelines should be readily available on the hospital computerized information system and ideally integrated with electronic ordering of tests. The computer system should document receipt of specimens in the laboratory, provide a record of testing in progress, and report preliminary and final results. The microbiologist should coordinate with key members of the medical staff a policy of immediate telephone notification of critical laboratory results, such as positive blood or other normally sterile fluid and tissue cultures, isolation of highly infectious pathogens, and significant positive stain results from clinical specimens. In addition, the microbiologist and medical staff should develop guidelines for reporting antibiotic susceptibility results for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Periodic publication of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for the most common bacteria can be used to guide empirical therapy. 2 The laboratory must ensure that its operation meets all current regulatory requirements (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments), including initial verification and ongoing validation of procedures that are used by the laboratory. 3, 4 Participation in external proficiency surveys, an effective program of quality control, and the use of established quality assurance benchmarks can ensure the accuracy of the laboratory test results. Minimizing testing costs is essential for an efficient laboratory operation but must be done without significant compromise of the quality of results. Finally, a system of short-term storage of all specimens and long-term storage of important isolates should be established to facilitate additional testing if required.",

The clinician should know the appropriate specimens and diagnostic tests for detection of specific pathogens and be prepared to alert the laboratory personnel when a specific fastidious (e.g., Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Bartonella spp.) or highly pathogenic (e.g., Francisella tularensis, drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuber culosis, Coccidioides immitis) organism is considered. The clinician should also be prepared to prioritize test requests when only a limited quantity of specimen can be collected. In this situation, discussions with the laboratory director can facilitate modification of the routine laboratory practices to optimize the testing process (e.g., need for routine stains, selection of media, and testing conditions to optimize recovery of both bacteria and fungi on a limited number of media). Communication with the laboratory director is also important when the clinical testing needs are not satisfied by the available test menu or test turnaround time, when a laboratory policy causes patient care problems, or when test results are inconsistent with a patient's clinical presentation.",

Much of the taxonomic reorganization now under way is driven by our increased ability to classify organisms by using gene sequencing and, more recently, mass spectrometry. The advantages of using these tools to classify and identify organisms are greater precision than by using traditional phenotypic tests and a better understanding of the relationship between newly described organisms and disease. The disadvantages are the practical challenges of remembering a rapidly expanding list of new names and the difficulties this presents for performing searches of the medical literature. Fortunately, an up-to-date list of all validly published names of bacteria, as well as the historical names of the organisms, is accessible on the Internet (www.bacterio.cict.fr/). The International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses publishes a similar database for viruses (www.ictvonline.org). The scientific names of fungi and parasites are defined by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (www.bgbm.org/iapt/nomenclature/code/default.htm) and the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (www.iczn.org), respectively; however, up-to-date lists of validly named fungi and parasites do not currently exist.",

Although a hospital surveillance program can monitor infection rates and noncompliance with established infection prevention policies, the most effective component to any infection control program is vigilance-on the part of the microbiologist and clinician. The microbiologist has the unique perspective of seeing all the organisms isolated from patients throughout the hospital and may be the first to recognize a small cluster of unique organisms. The clinician also has a unique perspective-the ability to assess the likelihood that an infection in his or her patient is nosocomial. Working in concert, the microbiologist and clinician play an important role in guiding a potential outbreak investigation. rapid but typically insensitive and nonspecific method for detection of pathogens. Thus, if the quantity of specimen is limited, the value of microscopy must be balanced with the need for other diagnostic tests. If microscopy is the primary diagnostic test (e.g., examination of peripheral blood smears for plasmodia, Babesia, Borrelia), then multiple specimens may need to be examined by using specialized stains or microscopy techniques. Selection of the appropriate specimen for detection of microbial antigens is determined by the suspected pathogen. For example, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) would be appropriate for diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis, but both CSF and urine should be collected for diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis. Likewise, the optimum specimens for diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia are bronchial lavage for culture and urine for antigen testing. Serologic tests are useful if the collection of blood is properly timed to coincide with the peak level of antibodies or to demonstrate a significant rise in antibodies. Because these levels can vary for different pathogens, collections of samples should be coordinated carefully to optimize their usefulness and not as an afterthought when confronted with initial negative tests.",

The laboratory should determine in what manner and how often specimens should be delivered and should periodically monitor this process to make sure that delivery to the laboratory is occurring as expected. It is important to include, with the time required to transport a specimen to the laboratory, the delays between collection of the specimen and shipment to the laboratory and the time between receipt of the specimen in the laboratory and laboratory processing. Efforts to minimize transit time (e.g., use of pneumatic tube systems) are wasted if there are significant delays after collection or receipt in the laboratory. The physician has the responsibility to minimize the former and the microbiologist the latter. These transit times should be monitored systematically as part of a diagnostic quality assurance program. It is also important to time the collection and transport of specimens to ensure they arrive in the laboratory before an established cutoff time for tests that are performed once per day or less often. Table 16 -2 summarizes generally accepted guidelines for specimen collection and transport of common specimen types for bacterial and fungal stains and cultures. Because specialized transport systems are used for viruses and parasites, these will be discussed separately. Not all situations can be covered under general guidelines. For these instances, the physician should contact laboratory personnel to discuss the best procedures for ensuring optimal handling of the specimen.

Because relatively few bacteria and fungi are present in the blood of septicemic patients, a large volume of blood is traditionally cultured in bottles containing nutrient broths. In the 1970s, the first automated system was developed that detected positive cultures by monitoring the broth for metabolic byproducts (i.e., radioactively labeled carbon dioxide) of microbial growth. In subsequent years, a number of commercial companies introduced a series of modifications of this brothbased system. The current fully automated systems monitor blood culture bottles for microbial growth every 10 to 20 minutes. Because this process can be done without entry into the bottles, contamination of the cultures resulting from laboratory processing is essentially eliminated. A variety of culture media are available for these systems, including aerobic and anaerobic broths, broths supplemented with resins to bind and remove antibiotics, broths for pediatric cultures, and fungal media. Use of resin-supplemented media significantly improves recovery of bacteria in patients who have been treated with antibiotics in the 48 hours before blood collection. 6 Decisions about which media should be routinely or selectively used should be made after the microbiologist and infectious disease specialists carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of each medium.",

If a specific pathogen is suspected, then selection of the appropriate specimen for the specific diagnostic test is straightforward; however, the differential diagnosis is typically not so limited. A variety of pathogens are usually considered, which increases the types of specimens that must be collected and the number of tests ordered. Although this may not pose a problem if the quantity of specimen is sufficient (e.g., blood, urine, stool, expectorated sputum), this can present a significant problem if the quantity is limited or the specimen difficult to obtain (e.g., aspirated fluids, tissue biopsy). Thus, the physician has the responsibility to consider carefully potential pathogens and the diagnostic tests that should be ordered. The physician also has the responsibility to ensure specimens representative of the site of infection are collected in the appropriate container and transported to the laboratory in a timely fashion.

Although microbiologists have recommended that blood for culture should not be drawn through catheters, the reality is this is frequently done and in many cases represents the only practical access site for critically ill patients. If a culture is collected through a catheter, then the access port should be disinfected with 70% alcohol before the blood is removed. Intravascular catheters represent a source for bacteremia and fungemia with both organisms on the skin surface as well as opportunistic gram-negative rods (e.g., Pseudomonas spp., Stenotroph omonas, Ochrabacterum, Methylobacterium) and acid-fast organisms (e.g., rapidly growing mycobacteria, Tsukamurella, Gordonia). Typically, blood cultures collected through a contaminated line have a higher inoculum than blood collected from a peripheral vein, which can be used to determine if a line is the source. This can be documented either by using a quantitative blood culture system, such as the lysiscentrifugation system, or by demonstrating earlier detection of a positive culture collected from the catheter versus the peripheral site. 10 Thus, whenever possible, all blood cultures collected from a catheter should also include a blood culture from a peripheral venipuncture site.",

If culture bottles are incubated for a longer period of time, fewer cultures can be processed in each instrument, thus increasing the need for additional instruments. I believe that incubation for less than 5 days is not justified because a small number of significant pathogens will likely not be detected (e.g., Aggregatibacter, Bartonella, Francisella, Campylobacter, Cryptococcus, Candida glabrata, rapidly growing mycobacteria). Furthermore, the microbiologist should be willing to extend the incubation period for selected cultures at the request of the infectious disease specialist.",

Chlorhexidine is the most rapid, effective disinfectant. 8 The septum of the culture bottle or tube should also be wiped with 70% alcohol and allowed to air dry. Blood can be collected with a needle and syringe or directly into the culture bottles with a collection system. If a needle and syringe is used, the needle should not be changed between collection and inoculation of the blood culture system because this procedure poses an unnecessary risk of a needlestick and has not been demonstrated to reduce contaminated blood cultures significantly. 9 If a collection system is used, care must be taken to avoid overfilling the culture bottles. Separate venipunctures should be performed for each culture to minimize contamination with bacteria from the skin surface (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium spp., Propionibacterium acnes). True infections with these organisms are commonly associated with intravascular catheters. In this setting, a persistent bacteremia occurs, so all blood cultures should be positive. If only one of two or three cultures is positive, then this more likely represents contamination of the culture during collection than catheter-acquired sepsis. Throat swabs submitted from patients with bacterial pharyngitis are only processed for Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) unless a specific request is submitted to look for other agents. 18 Although it is recognized that Streptococcus dysgalactiae (members of group C and G \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci) may also cause pharyngitis, the lack of proven rheumatic fever sequelae, as well as only rare reports of associated poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, has deterred laboratories from screening for and reporting these isolates. Likewise, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum can cause pharyngitis and a scarlet fever-like rash, but most laboratories do not screen for this uncommon organism. NAA assays and direct antigen tests are used for the rapid detection of S. pyogenes in throat swabs. The nucleic acid assays are highly accurate compared with culture methods, and results are available in approximately 1 hour. Antigen tests (enzyme immunoassays [EIAs] ) are widely used because they are specific, relatively inexpensive, and rapid, with results available within 10 to 20 minutes; however, these tests vary in their sensitivity, especially for detecting very low numbers of organisms. The recent introduction of lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays, interpreted with small digital readers, has significantly improved the sensitivity of these antigen tests. Although it would be expected that large numbers of organisms should be recovered in patients with disease, the quality of the specimen varies according to the effectiveness of the sampling process; therefore, very low numbers of organisms may still be significant. It is currently recommended that a negative antigen test should be confirmed with a traditional culture or nucleic acid assay, although this may be unnecessary with the new generation of immunoassays. Antibiotic susceptibility testing is not routinely done on S. pyogenes because all isolates remain universally susceptible to penicillin.",

For some organisms (i.e., S. dysgalactiae, A. haemolyticum) no specialized testing procedure is required; for other organisms, specialized culture media or alternative test methods are used. For example, selective media should be used for the recovery of C. diphtheriae, and toxin testing is required to demonstrate diphtheria toxin. Likewise, although Bordetella pertussis can be cultured on specialized media, nucleic acid amplification is the test of choice. Dacron, rayon, or calcium alginate swabs can be used to collect specimens for Bordetella culture, but calcium alginate swabs should be avoided if the specimen is submitted for nucleic acid amplification. 19 Some laboratories screen high-risk patients for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using nares swabs. A variety of selective, differential media have been developed for this purpose, although all are relatively insensitive unless the swab is incubated in an enrichment broth before the agar media are inoculated. Commercially produced nucleic acid amplification tests are also available for the rapid detection of this organism. 20, 21 Expectorated and induced sputa and tracheal aspirates are the most common specimens submitted for diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections. Although these specimens are readily obtained, the significance of recovering potential pathogens that are isolated is sometimes difficult to assess because pathogens colonizing the upper airways can contaminate the specimen. It is difficult to avoid contamination of induced sputa and tracheal aspirates; however, this can be minimized in expectorated sputa by instructing the patient to cough deeply and expectorate secretions from his or her lower chest directly into a clean container. A single coughed specimen is sufficient for bacterial cultures, and repeated expectorated specimens will only increase the risk of contamination. Care should be taken to submit the proper specimen because laboratories are required to screen and reject expectorated specimens submitted for bacterial culture that are contaminated with oral secretions (identified by the presence of squamous epithelial cells). Although not ideal, contaminated lower tract specimens can be processed for Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium, and molds because selective media can be used to suppress the growth of contaminants.",

An adequate quantity of fluid should be collected for the requested tests. This is generally not a problem with pleural and peritoneal fluids, but may pose a problem with CSF, synovial, and pericardial fluids. Gram staining and routine culture may require only 1 to 2 mL of fluid; however, if fungal or mycobacterial infection is suspected, larger volumes of fluid, preferably more than 5 mL for each test, increase the likelihood of successful culture. If a large quantity of pleural or peritoneal fluid is collected, then aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles should be inoculated, and additional fluid for microscopy, antigen testing, and nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests should be submitted to the laboratory in a sterile container. The sensitivity of microscopy can be improved by concentrating the specimen by centrifugation when it is received in the laboratory. Although microscopy is generally positive for patients with bacterial meningitis (infection with Listeria is the exception), prior exposure to antibiotics can rapidly eliminate organisms in CSF or alter their Gram stain properties. Use of direct antigen tests for bacteria in CSF has fallen into disfavor in recent years because the incidence of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis in young children has significantly decreased with the introduction of the H. influenzae type B conjugated vaccine and the lack of a reliable Neisseria meningitidis serotype B antigen test. Laboratories need to determine the real benefit, if any, of maintaining these tests in their hospital setting because they rarely affect patient management for acute bacterial meningitis. If the direct Gram stain is negative, initiation of antibiotic therapy based on the most appropriate empirical coverage, rather than in response to antigen testing, is a safer course of action in life-threatening situations. In contrast with the bacterial tests, antigen tests for Cryptococcus neofor mans are sensitive and specific. Cultures for the most common causes of meningitis (e.g., Streptococcus agalactiae [group B], Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes, C. neoformans) are generally positive within 1 to 2 days; however, the sensitive of culture can be significantly decreased by prior exposure to antibiotics. Detection of other organisms in culture may require extended incubation (e.g., Nocardia, Mycobacterium) or specialized media (e.g., Lepto spira). Serologic testing is the test of choice for Treponema pallidum (neurosyphilis) and Borrelia burgdorferi (neuroborreliosis). Although the use of multitarget NAA tests for the detection of all bacterial pathogens in CSF would provide a rapid, specific diagnosis of meningitis, these tests are currently available only as research tools.",

Thus, C. difficile disease is more widespread than previously recognized. 25 Documentation of C. difficile disease has been problematic. The diagnostic gold standard is to isolate the organism by culture of feces and demonstrate production of enterotoxin and require prompt transport to the laboratory for processing. Diagnoses obtained by the use of bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy have significantly decreased the need for open lung biopsies. Some laboratories use quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens to assess the significance of an isolated pathogen. 22 The value of this compared with traditional semiquantitative cultures (i.e., the presence of few, moderate, or abundant colonies of a pathogen) is controversial, so the use of quantitative respiratory cultures should be determined after discussions with the infectious disease physician and pulmonary specialists. Isolation of respiratory pathogens in biopsy specimens or fine-needle aspirates of the lungs is almost always considered significant. Likewise, regardless of the collection method or number of organisms present, some respiratory pathogens are never found to colonize the upper or lower airways and detection should always be considered significant (e.g., Legionella, M. pneumoniae, Chlamydia, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Histoplasma, Blas tomyces, Coccidioides, Cryptococcus).",

Vaginal candidiasis is most frequently diagnosed by direct smears that show many budding yeast and pseudohyphae. Although culture of Candida can be accomplished rapidly and easily, growth of Candida is not necessarily diagnostic of candidal infection because many asymptomatic women harbor Candida spp. Bacterial vaginosis results from a disruption of the normal bacterial population in the vagina with a decrease in lactobacilli and a proliferation of a mixture of bacteria, including Mobiluncus, Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella, Prevotella, and Atopobium. The diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is not based on bacterial culture because growth and identification of these presumed pathogens is difficult, slow, and unnecessary. Gram staining of vaginal secretions suggests bacterial vaginosis when the normally predominant gram-positive rods (i.e., lactobacilli) are absent and replaced with a prevalence of delicate gram-negative and gram-variable curved or fusiform bacteria (i.e., Mobiluncus) and gram-variable coccobacilli on epithelial cells (Gardnerella vaginalis on \"clue\" cells). The watery character of the discharge, a pH greater than 4.5, and the characteristic fishy amine odor after addition of potassium hydroxide (KOH) are also used to support this diagnosis. 29 N. gonorrhoeae is a major pathogen in genital infections such as cervicitis, salpingitis, urethritis, and epididymitis. This organism is labile; therefore, if culture is performed, then the specimen should be sent promptly to the laboratory in appropriate transport media and should never be refrigerated. Specimens should also not be transported to the laboratory on swabs. NAA tests have replaced culture in most laboratories because the tests are more sensitive and not influenced by transport delays. Culture and most NAA tests can also be used with anorectal or oropharyngeal specimens. Attempts to culture C. tracho matis have also been replaced by NAA tests, and tests for both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis can be performed on the same specimen. A rapid presumptive diagnosis of gonorrhea in symptomatic men can be made by examining a Gram stain of urethral discharge. The sensitivity and specificity of urethral smears in this setting are as high",

A variety of media, including broth media and media solidified with agar, have been developed for this purpose: general enriched, selective, differential, and specialized media (Table 16-6). Use of broth media allows the detection of small numbers of organisms or anaerobic organisms from a specimen where anaerobes are infrequently recovered (e.g., CSF). General enriched media (e.g., blood agar, chocolate agar) are designed to support the growth of most organisms. Selective media (e.g., MacConkey agar, phenylethyl alcohol agar) are designed to support the growth of certain organisms (e.g., gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria) and suppress the growth of other organisms. These media are particularly useful if a mixed population of organisms is present in a specimen. Differential media typically are selective media that contain substrates facilitating recognition of specific organisms (e.g., lactose-fermenting gramnegative rods growing on MacConkey agar, Salmonella or Shigella from a stool specimen inoculated onto xylose-lysine-deoxycholate [XLD] agar). Some organisms have very specific growth requirements (e.g., Legionella requires iron and cysteine; B. pertussis requires media with inhibitors of fatty acids, sulfides, and peroxides), so specialized media In some hospital settings, quantitative wound, burn eschar, or tissue biopsy specimen cultures have been used to help predict the likelihood of wound sepsis, burn infection, or the success of skin grafting. Quantitative culture requires weighing and careful preparation of the specimen for serial dilutions to determine whether the colony count is greater than 10 5 CFU/g of tissue. Such colony counts are correlated with a greater likelihood of infection associated with wound closure. Direct Gram smears of known quantities of specimen can also be used to give an immediate assessment of organism load. Because quantitative cultures are time consuming and labor intensive, not all laboratories have procedures in place for performing these assays. The availability of quantitative wound cultures should be checked by consultation with the laboratory before tests are ordered.",

An overview of detection methods for bacteria is summarized in this section. Table 16 -5 is a summary of the stains used to detect bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Bacteria are detected most commonly with differential (e.g., Gram, acid-fast, Giemsa) and fluorescent stains (acridine orange, auramine-rhodamine stains). The Gram stain is a simple, yet reliable stain that can provide important preliminary information on whether a bacterial infection is caused by a gram-negative or a gram-positive organism and whether the organism is a rod or a coccus. An experienced microscopist can further classify organisms based on subtle differences in morphology or special arrangements of the cells. For example, staphylococci are gram-positive cocci arranged in clusters; streptococci are gram-positive cocci arranged in chains; S. pneumoniae and Enterococcus are gram-positive cocci arranged in pairs; Enterobacteriaceae are gram-negative rods that stain more intensely at the ends rather than the center [bipolar staining]; Pseudomonas, Stenotroph omonas, and Burkholderia are small gram-negative rods frequently arranged in pairs; Acinetobacter are fat, coccobacilli that retain crystal violet when stained and resemble gram-positive cocci.

Only a limited number of genera responsible for human disease retain acid-fast stains: Mycobac terium, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Tsukamurella, and Gordonia. The genera other than Mycobacterium generally stain weakly with acid-fast stains and are referred to as partially or weakly acid-fast. The Giemsa and Wright-Giemsa stains are differential stains used primarily to detect bacteria (Borrelia) or bacterial inclusions (Anaplasma, Ehrlichia), as well as fungi and parasites, in blood specimens. Although the stains are insensitive, a positive stain is rapid confirmation of the presence of the organism. Fluorescent stains are generally the most sensitive microscopic stains because bacteria stained with fluorescent dyes are easy to detect in an otherwise black background. Auramine and rhodamine dyes are used in the variation of the acid-fast stain to detect mycobacteria. This stain is more sensitive than traditional acid-fast stains and is equally specific. The acridine-orange stain is used to detect bacteria in positive blood cultures when the Gram stain is negative and when certain very thin organisms are difficult to detect with the Gram stain (e.g., Campylobacter, Helicobacter). Specific fluorescent antibody stains with antiserum conjugated to a fluorescent label are used both for direct detection of bacteria in patient specimens as well as identification of isolated organisms. At present, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) stains are more commonly used for the detection and identification of viruses rather than bacteria. DFA tests are still used in some laboratories for selected bacteria (e.g., S. pyogenes, T. pallidum, Legio nella, and B. pertussis); however, the DFA test for S. pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) has primarily been replaced by antigen tests; the DFA test for T. pallidum is sensitive and specific for primary syphilis, but the reagents are not widely available; the DFA test for Legionella has low sensitivity; and the DFA tests for B. pertussis has low sensitivity and specificity. 30 with the microbiologist to avoid mishandling the specimen. All laboratories should have detailed procedures for processing specimens from a variety of sources. These protocols should be developed using standard reference manuals 5 and after discussions with clinicians. It should be recognized that knowledge of the microbes that colonize the human body is rapidly evolving with the introduction of DNA sequencing techniques that can detect previously uncultured organisms. As this work expands, it is likely that previously unrecognized organisms will be associated with infections. Table 16 -7 summarizes the available antigen tests for detection of bacteria, fungi, viruses, or parasites in clinical specimens. The advantages of these tests are they can be rapidly performed and are relatively inexpensive. The disadvantages are poor sensitivity or specificity for certain organisms and limited availability of some assays (e.g., assays for Yersinia pestis, Norovirus, Plasmodium falciparum). Antigen tests have been developed for recovery of these organisms. Particularly important specialized media are used for performing antimicrobial susceptibility tests. The success of culture methods is dependent on the incubation conditions. The obvious example is recovery of most anaerobes requires that the inoculated agar plates be incubated in an anaerobic atmosphere. Likewise, some organisms, such as Campylobacter and Helicobacter, grow only in a microaerophilic atmosphere. Some organisms grow slowly and require extended incubation (e.g., Bartonella, B. pertussis, Brucella, Francisella, Legionella). It is impractical and unnecessary for the microbiologist to inoculate all specimens onto the large variety of available media and incubate the cultures in the numerous incubation conditions. Indeed, the microbiologist must frequently make decisions about how to best culture a specimen of limited quantity. Thus, it is critical for the clinician to clearly describe the source of the specimen and the suspected pathogens. If a specimen such as a biopsy or normally sterile fluid is collected, and collection of additional material is not practical, then it is important for the clinician to talk Selective media; recovery optimal using multiple media; incubation at 37\u00b0 to 42\u00b0 C in microaerophilic atmosphere",

An experienced microbiologist often is able to provide a reliable presumptive identification of common bacteria on the basis of these early characteristics and some preliminary identification tests. For example, an opaque white or light yellow colony that appears as gram-positive cocci found predominantly in clusters will be tested with a rapid coagulase test to identify the isolate as S. aureus or a coagulasenegative Staphylococcus species. Table 16 -9 describes key tests that are commonly used, along with colony and Gram stain morphology, to identify selected species of bacteria. 32 The historical classification of bacteria was based on their microscopic properties (e.g., gram-positive, gram-negative, acid-fast; cocci, rods, spiral-shaped), oxygen tolerance (i.e., aerobic, anaerobic), and patterns of biochemical reactivity (Table 16 -10). The biochemical tests included fermentation or oxidation of carbohydrates (e.g., fermentation of glucose or lactose), use of carbon sources, presence of specific enzymes, or production of volatile fatty acids. A minimum number of these tests performed in test tubes could identify most of the for bacteria responsible for meningitis (i.e., S. agalactiae, S. pneu moniae, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae type B) are not recommended as a screening assay because they are no more sensitive than a Gram stain; however, these assays can be useful for the presumptive identification of an organism observed on Gram staining. A diagnosis of pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae or L. pneumophila can be confirmed by detection of specific antigens in urine; however, negative assays must be confirmed by culture. Likewise, although group A Strep tococcus antigen tests are widely used, negative assays must also be confirmed by either culture or a nucleic acid amplification assay. Antigen tests for the detection of Campylobacter or Helicobacter antigens in stool specimens or Shiga toxin produced by E. coli are rapid, sensitive assays for diagnosing infections caused by these organisms. Antigen tests are also widely used for detection of C. difficile toxins in stool specimens; however, the tests are insensitive and nonspecific and should not be used. 31 Immunoassays for C. trachomatis antigens have now been replaced in most laboratories by NAA tests. Thus, the value of antigen tests must be carefully assessed based on the performance characteristics of the individual assays and the availability of alternative detection methods. reactions that could be interpreted after a few hours of incubation and the introduction of instrumentation for the interpretation of the individual reactions and metabolic profile. Further improvements include the development of fully automated systems for the inoculation, incubation, and interpretation of these tests. Extensive databases exist that allow the theoretical identification of most clinically important bacteria. These systems have also been integrated with antimicrobial susceptibility tests (to be discussed later). A detailed discussion of the manual and automated commercial identification systems is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, most laboratories use a combination of these systems.",

Availability of accurate typing helps to control outbreaks more rapidly and can help in the identification of sources, carriers, and patterns of spread. The main genotypic methods that are currently in use include pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of chromosomal DNA, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, such as random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). 33 The different methods vary in reproducibility, ease of performance, turnaround time, robustness, and discriminatory power, with PFGE considered by many the gold standard. It is important to recognize that all these methods are relatively crude techniques to assess the similarities or differences in genetic composition among strains of bacteria. A more precise method for accomplishing this is whole-genome sequencing. With the dramatic improvements in sequencing techniques, whole-genome sequencing has enabled a level of discrimination among strain previously unattainable in epidemiologic investigations. As these sequencing techniques are further automated, it is anticipated that genome sequencing will replace the earlier genotypic methods. ",

There are more than 250 different \u03b2-lactamases produced by bacteria, so it is logical that a variety of methods have been developed. Two examples will illustrate important applications of these tests. Organisms such as Staphylococcus, Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Bacteroides produce a common \u03b2-lactamase that will degrade most penicillins and selected cephalosporins. The \u03b2-lactamase activity can be detected by measuring the byproducts of these degraded antibiotics. The most common method measures degradation of the chromogenic cephalosporin nitrocefin, which produces a red byproduct. Another important group of \u03b2-lactamases are the extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs). ESBL-producing organisms are resistant to all penicillins, cephalosporins, and monobactams, even when the in vitro tests indicate susceptibility. Diffusion and dilution tests have been developed to detect ESBL production. Reduced activity to cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or aztreonam is used to screen for ESBL production, and then inhibition of this \u03b2-lactamase activity by \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors (i.e., sulbactam, clavulanic acid) is used to confirm the screening test. 38 Resistance to carbapenem antibiotics in gram-negative rods is mediated by a number of novel \u03b2-lactamases. This resistance is initially detected by elevated MICs to one or more carbapenems and then confirmed by detection of the specific resistance gene by molecular tests. Carbapenem-resistant gram-negative rods should be considered resistant to all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.",

Thus, high-level resistance is defined by MIC values greater than or equal to 2000 \u00b5g/mL for streptomycin and greater than or equal to 500 \u00b5g/mL for gentamycin.

The most popular agar diffusion method is the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. 39 In this method, the test agar plate is swabbed with a standardized concentration of the test organism, and then paper disks containing a defined antibiotic concentration are placed on the lawn of bacteria. After overnight incubation, the diameter of the zone of inhibited growth around the disk is measured. This zone is influenced by a number of variables, including the susceptibility test medium (Mueller-Hinton agar is the standard for bacterial tests), the concentration of the test organism, the rate of growth of the test organism, the concentration of antibiotic in the disk, the diffusion of the antibiotic in the agar, and the susceptibility of the organism to the antibiotic. The first five variables are standardized by CLSI; therefore, if the test is properly performed, the size of the zone of inhibited growth is directly related to the susceptibility of the organism-the larger the zone, the more susceptible the organism is to the antibiotic. As would be expected, the results of the dilution tests and diffusion tests are related. There is an inverse linear relationship between the size of the zone and the MIC value-the larger the zone of inhibited growth (more susceptible the organism to the antibiotic), the smaller the MIC value. Thus, it is possible to extrapolate from the measured size of the inhibitory zone to the corresponding MIC value. In addition, the interpretive criteria that are applied to MIC tests apply to the diffusion tests. Thus, for most organism-antibiotic tests, the diffusion tests and dilution tests are equally accurate in predicting antimicrobial susceptibility.",

            "text": "Specimens such as sputum, urine, and stool, which can be expected to contain considerable normal microbial flora, must be digested and decontaminated to prevent overgrowth of any mycobacteria present. These processing steps are inevitably somewhat toxic to mycobacteria, and a balance must be struck to minimize the loss of mycobacteria while simultaneously maximizing the elimination of as many other microorganisms as possible. 41 Concentration of the specimen occurs as part of the digestion and decontamination procedures, and smears of a specimen are prepared from such concentrates. The most commonly used digestion and decontamination procedure entails the use of a mixture of N-acetyl-l-cysteine and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), although other procedures are occasionally used, such as the oxalic acid procedure for specimens heavily contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 41 Sterile fluids, such as CSF, may be concentrated for smear preparation and plating without prior digestion and decontamination. Biopsies specimens obtained from normally sterile sites must be ground before plating but also do not require prior digestion and decontamination. Blood processed by a lysis-centrifugation method can be planted onto solid media, from which blood organism concentration can be determined. Currently, several types of mycobacterial blood culture bottles that can be used with automated instruments are available for direct inoculation, but quantitation cannot be obtained with liquid culture media. 41 It is recommended that a liquid, in addition to a solid medium, be used for plating specimens whenever practical; the liquid media may enhance both the sensitivity of culture and the rapidity of organism detection. 41, 46 Use of a liquid medium often results in the isolation of M. tuberculosis within 2 weeks and isolation of other slowly growing mycobacteria in even less time. Consequently, when one of these liquid media has been used, one cannot assume that an organism detected within a week of incubation is necessarily a rapid grower in the traditional sense. Antimicrobial agents may be added to liquid and solid media to help prevent overgrowth of contaminants; some of these agents may be inhibitory to some mycobacteria (e.g., nalidixic acid may inhibit some strains of rapidly growing mycobacteria and M. kansasii); hence, if media with and without antimicrobials are used, the chance of isolating any mycobacteria present may be enhanced. If no growth is obtained from a smear-positive specimen from an untreated patient, the possibility that optimal growth conditions for the organism have not been used or that the organism is uncultivable should be considered. Many liquid-based systems use an instrument for automated detection of organism growth, but some nonautomated systems are also available. Detection is based on such features as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) production (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioM\u00e9rieux, Lyon, France), oxygen consumption (BACTEC 9000MB System and Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube [MGIT], Becton-Dickinson, Sparks, MD), and monitoring the rate of oxygen consumption by measuring pressure changes in the culture vial (VersaTREK, Magellan Biosciences, Cleveland, OH). 41 Mycobacterial cultures are generally incubated at 36\u00b0 C \u00b1 1\u00b0 C in an atmosphere of approximately 8% CO 2 , the optimum conditions for isolation of M. tuberculosis. However, several species of pathogenic mycobacteria have different growth requirements or preferences that may have to be satisfied to ensure their isolation (Table . Given the preference of several skin and subcutaneous pathogens to grow at 30\u00b0 C (including Mycobacterium haemophilum, M. marinum, M. ulcer ans, and rapid growers), at least a portion of all skin biopsy specimens (and perhaps other specimen types obtained from cooler areas of the body such as the extremities) submitted for mycobacterial culture of the hazard posed to personnel. Gastric aspirates require pH neutralization soon after collection to ensure the viability of any mycobacteria that may be present; arrangements should be made with the laboratory in advance to ensure optimal specimen handling. Biopsies are preferable to swab specimens of tissue lesions for the isolation of mycobacteria. No special procedures are usually necessary for the collection and transport of sterile fluids, urine, and stool. However, organism concentrations in sterile fluids may be low, so a minimum of several milliliters (in the case of CSF, more than 5 mL if possible) should be obtained whenever mycobacterial infection is a serious consideration. 41 Blood may be collected for mycobacterial culture, either in a blood collection tube that contains anticoagulant or in a lysis-centrifugation tube, or it may be inoculated directly into a special bottle for mycobacterial blood culture, depending on laboratory protocol. Twenty-four-hour collections of sputum and urine are unacceptable because of the likelihood of bacterial overgrowth. For sputum and urine, it is recommended that at least three first-morning specimens be obtained and that a minimum of 40 mL of midstream urine be processed for each culture. 41 Protocols for handling different specimen types vary significantly among laboratories, and it is important for physicians to be aware of the procedures used by each of the laboratories they use.",

            "text": "The Gram stain is insensitive for the detection of mycobacteria. If visible at all, mycobacteria may appear as finely beaded, gram-positive rods with only the beads visible (gram-positive) and the rest of the organism appearing gram-negative, or they may appear as negative images (unstained rodlike outlines) in the specimen. Specific mycobacterial stains are based on the ability of mycobacteria to retain certain dyes after washing with an acid-alcohol decolorizer (hence, \"acid fast\"), unlike most other bacteria. The primary stain in the Ziehl-Neelsen and Kinyoun stains is carbolfuchsin, staining mycobacteria red. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain requires a heating step and has been replaced in many laboratories by the Kinyoun stain, which is a \"cold\" acid-fast stain. The auramine O and auramine-rhodamine stains use fluorescent compounds; although fluorescence microscopy is required for visualization of mycobacteria, these stains do not involve the use of an antibody but are based on the acid-fast properties of mycobacteria. Fluorescent stains are more sensitive for the detection of mycobacteria, particularly in direct specimens, because the organisms stain brightly and can be clearly distinguished from background material. In addition, because slides stained with a fluorescent dye can be examined reliably with an objective lens of lower magnification (25\u00d7) than with the oil immersion lens (100\u00d7) required for carbolfuchsin-stained smears, reading of slides can be done faster. Rapidly growing mycobacteria may be less avidly acid fast than are slow growers and may be more readily visualized with a modified acid-fast stain that uses a weaker decolorizing step than is used with a regular carbolfuchsin stain. Some species of mycobacteria differ from others in the length, width, or arrangement of individual cells. Mycobacterium kansasii, for example, tends to be long and broad, sometimes with a banded rather than a beaded appearance, whereas Mycobacterium avium complex may appear coccobacillary, especially on a smear from a liquid medium. Particularly when grown in a liquid medium, cells of M. tuberculosis often group together in \"cords\" that are composed of long strands of organisms with their long axes parallel. However, the microscopic appearance of individual cells and groups of cells should at best be considered only suggestive of a certain species or group of species. 42 The CDC currently recommends that a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) should be performed on the first sputum from all patients suspected with a M. tuberculosis infection for which the test result would alter case management or tuberculosis (TB) control activities. Despite this recommendation, there is only one FDA-approved test currently available (see Table 16 -8) for respiratory specimens, and the test sensitivity is high only for smear-positive specimens. 43 Other NAATs are available for research use only or for clinical testing outside the United States. Laboratory-developed tests (e.g., DNA sequencing, after light exposure. Nonphotochromogens do not produce pigment even after light stimulation. However, not all isolates of some species will fall into the same category based on growth rate or pigment production. For example, most isolates of M. avium complex are nonphotochromogenic, but some are scotochromogenic; many isolates of M. marinum (a photochromogen) grow rapidly, and isolates of M. szulgai are usually photochromogenic at 25\u00b0 C but scotochromogenic at 36\u00b0 C. M. tuberculosis complex, although by definition not a member of any of the Runyoun groups, is in fact a nonphotochromogen. This is important because if a pigmented, acid-fast colony is isolated in culture, this effectively excludes M. tuberculosis.",

A practical method for preliminary identification of M. tuberculosis is the demonstration of niacin production and reduction of nitrate. However, for the definitive identification of this and other species, genomic or proteomic methods should be used. Table 16 -8). These chemiluminescent compoundlabeled probes are DNA probes for rRNA, which exists in multiple copies in each cell; they can be used only with organisms grown in culture, not directly on patient specimens. The procedure can be performed within a matter of hours from the time of organism isolation. Laboratories not doing further testing of isolates of the M. avium complex and the M. tuberculosis complex should make it clear that their identifications have not gone beyond the level of the complex (e.g., they should report \"M. tuberculosis complex, \" not \"M. tuberculo sis,\" unless additional appropriate testing such as niacin and nitrate reactions has been done). Other nucleic acid-based methods for identification of mycobacterial species include amplification of a portion of the genome common to all mycobacteria (such as 16S rRNA, HSP, or secA1 genes), followed by the use of species-specific probes or sequencing of the amplified material. Identification of mycobacteria with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry has recently been reported to be rapid and highly accurate. Conventional MALDI-TOF methods (see earlier) were modified for mycobacteria by inactivation of isolates by heat treatment, followed by use of sonication with glass beads in the presence of formic acid and acetonitrile. This method is very promising because definitive identification of isolates could be accomplished in less than 1 hour.",

            "text": "The diagnostic mycology laboratory uses terminology that, although it has little taxonomic significance, is useful in terms of determining both clinical relevance and identification. Yeasts are unicellular organisms that grow as relatively smooth, creamy colonies, whereas molds produce fuzzy colonies because of the production of aerial hyphae. Some organisms may initially produce yeastlike colonies that become more moldlike with continued incubation. Microscopically, yeasts appear as round or oval cells that reproduce by budding. Many yeasts, such as most species of Candida, also produce hyphal structures. Hyphae are morphologically subdivided into pseudohyphae and true hyphae. Pseudohyphae resemble chains of sausages in that the hyphae tend to be constricted at the septa, and each cell originates as a bud. The cell at the tip tends to be small and rounded, and a septum is often found at each branch point. In contrast, true hyphae tend to have straighter, more parallel walls without constrictions at the septa and usually without a septum at the branch point. True hyphae may be either septate or aseptate. True hyphae that are septate suggest organisms such as Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Scedosporium. True aseptate hyphae may be broad and have a ribbon-like appearance; their presence suggests one of the Mucorales (aseptate molds) such as Rhizomu cor. Brown pigment in hyphae suggests that the organism is a dematiaceous (black) mold; hyaline molds do not produce pigmented hyphae. These simplified distinctions are not absolute. Thus, some Candida species can form true hyphae, and the \"aseptate\" molds may have an occasional septum. Dermatophytes and dimorphic molds are usually considered separate categories of mold distinct from the other hyaline septate molds. The likelihood that an organism may be a dermatophyte is usually suggested by the specimen source (e.g., skin, hair, nails). Dimorphic molds have a nonmold form when they are growing in the patient but grow as a mold in the laboratory at 30\u00b0 C. Table 16-13 summarizes some of the more significant and more commonly isolated genera and species according to the categories frequently used in the diagnostic laboratory. Of the clinically significant dimorphic molds, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Penicillium marneffei, and Sporothrix schenckii grow as yeasts or yeastlike structures in the patient at 37\u00b0 C and hence are thermally dimorphic. Coccidioides species most commonly grow in the patient as thick-walled spherules and require a special medium that is not widely available to be grown in this form in vitro; otherwise, these species grow as a mold both at 30\u00b0 C and at 35\u00b0 C and hence are not thermally dimorphic. Two species of Coccidioides are now recognized, C. immitis and C. posadasii, and can be distinguished by molecular methods, although it is not clear that there are any clinically significant differences between them. 55 Many molds have a morphologic form that results from sexual reproduction; these differ from the form that results from asexual reproduction. The form that results from sexual reproduction is known as the teleomorph, or perfect state; the form that results from asexual reproduction is known as the anamorph, or imperfect state. In the past, each form has been given a different scientific name; for example, the sexual form of H. capsulatum is named Ajellomyces capsulatum, and the sexual form of Scedosporium apiospermum is named Pseudallesche ria boydii. Now, all fungi will be given a single name, using historical precedent and common use.",

Containment facilities (e.g., a BSL-2 laboratory for specimen handling, initial isolation, and identification; BSL-3 is for further propagation of such agents) are needed to process specimens and to work with cultures of these organisms. 56 Because infectious spores are not present in patient specimens such as sputa or biopsy specimens, these specimens are not considered hazardous by the aerosol route, but they would be infectious by accidental inoculation. Because several of the dimorphic molds can be significant laboratory hazards when grown in mold phase, the clinician should alert laboratory personnel whenever a patient has a significant probability Nocardia is buffered charcoal-yeast extract (BCYE) agar, originally developed for the recovery of Legionella (see Table 16 -6); the same medium with antimicrobial agents inhibitory to most other bacteria can be used for specimens such as sputum, which may also contain normal flora. 53 Cultures for Nocardia should be held for 2 weeks, although most isolates grow within 3 to 5 days.",

It is estimated that there may be several million species of fungi, of which less than 500 have been reported to be human or animal pathogens with any frequency. However, additional pathogenic species are reported in the literature regularly, as the result of both already-known organisms being recognized as pathogens and the description of new species. The members of the genus Pneumocystis, formerly considered to be parasites, are now considered fungi, and recent taxonomic studies have demonstrated that members of the phylum Microsporidia belong to the kingdom Fungi. 54 The genus Prototheca is thought to be an achlorophyllous alga; organisms in this genus can be pathogenic and are usually included in discussions of fungi because they grow well on most fungal culture media. silver, periodic acid-Schiff, and Papanicolaou stains. In the microbiology laboratory, fungi are usually visualized directly by a Gram stain, a KOH wet mount, or a calcofluor white stain (see Table 16 -6) . With the Gram stain, yeast cells and pseudohyphae of Candida species usually stain uniformly throughout as gram-positive, whereas the cells of C. neoformans may be unevenly speckled with crystal violet and may be surrounded by an orange halo that is presumably capsular material. The true hyphae of organisms such as Aspergillus spp. or Rhizopus spp. are gram-negative, visible as unstained negative images, or Gram-stain invisible. In clinical specimens, the aseptate molds tend to appear as broad, branching, ribbon-like structures of rather uneven width that tend to fold on themselves, whereas hyaline septate molds tend to be smaller and more regular in width, and do not exhibit the folding often found in aseptate molds. Although KOH wet mounts allow visualization of most fungi, organisms may actually be quite difficult to discern because they do not stand out prominently from the background; in addition, tissue components, such as blood vessels, can be mistaken for fungal elements, so considerable care and expertise are required for the reading of such preparations. In the calcofluor white stain, a fluorescent compound binds to certain cell wall polysaccharides found in all fungi; organisms stained by this dye can be readily visualized with the use of a fluorescence microscope.",

Twentyfour-hour collections of urine or sputa are not suitable for fungal culture because of bacterial overgrowth; first morning specimens are considered optimal. Aspirated material can be transported to the laboratory in an anaerobic transport vial; as long as the specimen is received and processed promptly by the laboratory, little loss of fungal viability appears to occur. 57 Blood culture performed by lysis-centrifugation is still considered to be the most sensitive procedure for the isolation of H. capsulatum from blood and is perhaps the best technique to use for the isolation of all molds from blood (see Table 16 -4). 57 Commercially available broth and biphasic systems have been shown to be quite sensitive for the isolation of yeasts from blood. 31 A source of fatty acids, such as olive oil, must be added to media to recover Malassezia spp.; clinicians should therefore notify the laboratory when the presence of this organism is suspected. Fungal cultures are generally incubated at 30\u00b0 C, and until recently, they were generally held for 4 weeks, or even longer, when the presence of a slowly growing mold such as H. capsu latum was suspected.

The assay, which can detect Pneumocystis in oral washes or sputum, may also be of benefit in patients who are too ill to undergo invasive procedures such as bronchoalveolar lavage, although PCR cannot distinguish colonization from infection. 59 Fungi may be visualized histopathologically or cytologically by a variety of special stains, such as the methenamine identification.

For example, currently available interpretive guidelines are available only for Candida spp., but CLSI document M27-S3 notes that Candida krusei is assumed to be intrinsically resistant to fluconazole, and MICs of isolates of that species should not be interpreted with the available fluconazole scale. 63 For itraconazole, the interpretive data are based solely on results with mucosal infections, and sufficient data are not available to provide breakpoints for invasive infections. In the case of filamentous fungi, the way the MIC should be read is different for various organismantifungal agent pairs. For example, for fluconazole and ketoconazole, complete absence of growth at the MIC is not required. Rather, \"the turbidity allowed corresponds to approximately 50% or more (nondermatophyte isolates) to 80% or more (dermatophyte isolates) reduction in growth compared with the growth in the control well (drug-free medium). \" 64 For the echinocandins, the concept of (minimal effective concentration\" is used; this is \"the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that leads to the growth of small, rounded, compact hyphal forms, compared with the hyphal growth seen in the growth control well. \" 64 With regard to the relevance of the end points obtained in the testing of filamentous fungi, the CLSI document states, \"The clinical relevance of testing this group of fungal pathogens remains uncertain, and breakpoints with proven relevance have yet to be identified by CLSI or any regulatory agency. \" 64",

It is usually impossible to attach clinical significance to the isolation of Candida from pulmonary material other than a lung biopsy because Candida can be part of the normal upper respiratory tract flora. Even C. neoformans may occasionally be a colonizer and not a pathogen in the respiratory tract. Isolation of opportunistic pathogens, such as Aspergillus spp. from the respiratory tract of an immunocompromised patient, presents a particularly difficult interpretive problem for which no unambiguous guidelines exist. In addition to the clinical and radiographic aspects of each situation, it may be useful to consider (1) whether the organism was seen directly in the specimen, (2) the quantity of organism that grew in culture, (3) if the organism is isolated in multiple cultures, and (4) the particular genus or species recovered (e.g., Aspergillus niger is less likely to be a pathogen than is Aspergillus fumigatus or Aspergillus flavus). Penicillium species other than P. marneffei are common laboratory contaminants; their isolation is almost never indicative of disease. However, because many different fungi are capable of causing at least occasional cases of infection, each situation needs to be assessed individually. The laboratory should never assume a particular isolate is a contaminant and not report recovering the organism. Rather, the laboratory concerns should be discussed with the ordering physician and the isolate reported with the qualification that it is a possible laboratory contaminant.",

Both manual kits and automated systems are available for the identification of clinically significant yeasts. In addition, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is highly accurate for identification of yeasts at the species level, making the need for phenotypic tests unnecessary. 60 Identification of most molds is based largely on the morphologic features of the organism, but for certain organisms, other features, such as the ability to grow at higher temperatures or the need for specific nutritional supplements, are also used. For some fungi, assignment to a particular genus may be straightforward, whereas identification to the species level may require a mycologist with expertise in the particular group in question; examples include organisms that belong to the genera Curvularia and Fusarium. Chemiluminescent probes are available for the identification of isolates of B. dermatitidis, Coccidioides spp., and H. capsulatum (see Table 16 -8) . As with similar probes for mycobacterial identification, they are intended for use with isolates, not with direct patient specimens; the probe is a DNA probe for organism ribosomal RNA. These probes can be used with either the yeast or mold phase, thus allowing early identification of isolates and obviating the need for conversion of the mold to the yeast phase for B. derma titidis and H. capsulatum.

NAA (specifically PCR) is the method of choice for the detection of HSV in CSF. 68 In the past, definitive diagnosis of CNS infection caused by HSV relied on the use of brain biopsy. Because detection in CSF by PCR is as sensitive as histologic stains of brain biopsy specimens, CSF PCR is now the recommended test for establishing this diagnosis. Traditional laboratory methods for the detection of HSV, CMV, and VZV in CSF, such as cell culture, antigen detection, and CSF or serum antibody detection, are known to be insensitive and are no longer recommended. 69 Multiplex assays for the simultaneous detection of a number of respiratory viruses are available as commercial kits: FilmArray (BioFire Diagnostics), Prodesse (Hologic Gen-Probe), xTAG (Luminex, Austin, TX), and Verigene (Nanosphere).

Two approaches are currently used for the microscopic detection of viruses: electron microscopy to observe individual viral particles and light microscopy to observe intracellular viral clumps or \"inclusions. \" Although electron microscopy provides a relatively rapid detection of viral particles, few diagnostic laboratories currently use this technique. The test is useful for certain viruses (e.g., rotavirus, poxviruses, polyomavirus); however, equally rapid and more sensitive antigen and NAA tests are available for these agents. Histologic examination of tissues for viral inclusions is a rapid diagnostic test for some viruses, such as measles virus (Warthin-Finkeldey giant cells), rabies virus (Negri bodies), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and CMV. Wright-Giemsa smears of skin vesicles, showing multinucleated giant cells, have been used to diagnose HSV or VZV (Tzanck preparation). Specificity of microscopic examination of tissues and fluids from lesions is improved with staining techniques that use fluorescein-labeled antibodies directed against the virus (DFA tests). Commercial reagents for DFA tests are available for the herpesviruses (CMV, HSV, VZV) and respiratory viruses (influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus, RSV, human metapneumovirus). The DFA test is particularly effective for VZV, where culture is insensitive; however, microscopy for most other viruses is less sensitive than alternative detection methods. 67 Fluorescein-labeled antibodies are also used to identify infected cells in tissue culture.",

In some infections, this can be a symbiotic relationship, where viral replication does not compromise host cell survival, and in other cases, viral replication leads to cell death. In vitro tissue culture systems were developed to mimic the natural environment for viral replication. These cell culture techniques allow detection of a wide range of viruses, including infections with a mixture of viruses. Tissue culture cells can be primary (divided only a few times), diploid (capable of 20-50 passages), or heteroploid (able to be maintained indefinitely). Because no one cell line will support the replication of all viruses, diagnostic virology laboratories use multiple cell lines. For example, influenza and parainfluenza viruses replicate in primary cell lines such as RhMK (primary rhesus monkey kidney) cells or heteroploid cell lines such as LLC-Mk2 (rhesus monkey kidney), whereas adenoviruses and RSV replicate in other cell lines such as A549 (human lung carcinoma) or HEp-2 (human epidermoid larynx carcinoma). Cocultured However, care must be used in the interpretation of the serologic results because crossreactions between these viruses are common. Serology is also helpful for documenting infections with hantavirus, arenaviruses, and filoviruses, although acutely ill patients may fail to develop antibodies. Serology is the foundation for assessing the immune status of immunocompetent individuals to parvovirus B19 infection, in whom both IgM antibodies and total antibodies can be measured using commercially available assays. In contrast, serology is not useful for neonates or immunocompromised individuals, and NAA tests should be performed to determine if infection exists. 71 Detection of antibodies to CMV in serum from blood or organ donors and recipients is important for the prevention of CMV disease in immunocompromised patients at high risk for developing severe, life-threatening disease and is performed with ELISA or latex agglutination tests. The detection of IgM antibodies to CMV can also be used to diagnose acute infection in neonates and pregnant women, although NAA tests have replaced serology for this application in most laboratories. In this setting, assessment of IgG antibodies in neonates is not useful because maternal antibodies may be present.",

Replacement of whole-virus lysates with purified viral antigens or recombinant antigens has improved the assay specificity and in some cases sensitivity. Overall test sensitivity is determined by the timing of the sample collection-a test will have poor sensitivity if the blood sample is collected before antibodies are detectable reliably.

Phenotypic assays require growth of the virus in vitro; therefore, viruses for which in vitro culture systems are not available, such as hepatitis B virus, cannot be tested with these assays. Results from phenotypic assays may not be available within a time frame that is clinically relevant because they all require initial propagation of the virus to attain a standard inoculum concentration, followed by growth of the virus in the assay to obtain results. After up to a week of propagation to prepare inoculum, once the assay has been set up, results for HSV may be obtained in 48 hours. For CMV, results may take 8 to 14 days after several weeks of propagation. Results of phenotypic assays are reported as the drug concentration that causes a 50% inhibition (inhibition concentration [IC] 50 ) or a 95% inhibition (IC 95 ) in growth of the virus. Comparison of the results of phenotypic assays from different laboratories is difficult. The most commonly used phenotypic antiviral susceptibility assay is the plaque reduction assay (PRA), which measures the ability of varying concentrations of an antiviral agent to inhibit the viral cytopathic effect as the end point. The CLSI offers a proposed standard in an effort to standardize the PRA for HSV. 76 Other end points for phenotypic viral assays that have been developed in an effort to make phenotypic testing more rapid and sensitive include dye uptake by viable (noninfected) cells, DNA hybridization, ELISA, plaque autoradiography, and flow cytometry. 77 Genotypic assays have been developed for the rapid detection of mutations that confer antiviral-drug resistance. Results from these assays simply report the presence or absence of a mutation known to confer resistance to a specific antiviral agent. Most genotypic assays use PCR to amplify specific viral genes, followed by direct sequencing of the amplified products or hybridization to specific probes on membrane strips or gene chips to detect changes in the sequence known to be associated with resistance to antiviral agents. Genotypic assays for the detection of drug resistance in HSV and VZV reveal thymidine kinase mutations that confer resistance to acyclovir, famciclovir, penciclovir, and valacyclovir. Genotypic assays used for determining resistance to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir in CMV detect mutations in the phosphotransferase and DNA polymerase genes. 77 The major drawback of genotypic assays is that they can detect only resistance caused by known mutations.

If the specimen must be examined within 2 weeks of administering these agents, then the report, if negative, should indicate the specimen was suboptimal, and additional specimens should be submitted at a later time. Stool specimens may be examined for the presence of motile parasites. In this case, the specimen should be promptly transported to the laboratory immediately after collection and not placed in preservatives. If a delay in transport is anticipated, then the specimen should be placed in preservatives at the time of collection because protozoan trophozoites are fragile and will rapidly deteriorate. This is not a problem with protozoan cysts or helminth eggs and larvae, coccidia, or microsporidia. A variety of fixatives are available for preserving stool specimens (e.g., formalin, sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin, Schaudinn's fluid, polyvinyl alcohol). The selection of preservatives will be determined by the methods used in the microbiology laboratory for examining the specimen and use of additional tests (e.g., antigen or NAA tests). Regardless of the preservative used, care must be used to add the appropriate amount of specimen to the container and ensure complete mixing of the stool specimen with the preservative. 80 It is recommended that three specimens should be collected, to exclude reliably a parasitic infection. Examination of a single specimen may have a sensitivity of 50% to 60%. 81 The specimens should be collected on separate days and, if possible, spread over a week or more.",

However, if seroconversion cannot be demonstrated, then a careful travel and exposure history is required to interpret the significance of seropositive results. For Toxoplasma infections, IgM and IgG antibody titers are determined. A negative IgM titer excludes acute infection because all patients with active disease have IgM antibodies at the time symptoms develop, which decrease to nondetectable levels by 6 to 9 months. IgG antibody levels will persist for years.",

Many parasites can be readily detected by examining the collected specimen directly or following staining with iodine; however, maximum sensitivity requires concentration of the specimen and examination with specific stains to allow differentiation of the internal structures (e.g., trichrome stain, iron hematoxylin stain, Giemsa stain). Identification of the parasite is determined by the morphologic features of the protozoa and the characteristics of the eggs, larvae, or adult forms of cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes. Details of these features are discussed in the individual chapters in this book and in the cited reference texts. 8, 79 Culture Culture is primarily performed in research laboratories with one exception: Trichomonas vaginalis infections. Although trichomonal infections can be readily detected by microscopic inspection of vaginal secretions, commercial kits permit the growth of T. vaginalis directly by culturing the vaginal exudate.

Previously, tests were restricted primarily to the detection of N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and M. tuberculosis in clinical specimens,; screening blood products for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV); and the use of nonamplified probes for identification of selected bacteria and fungi in clinical specimens. In the last few years, the number of companies that have entered the field of molecular diagnostics has increased, as have the variety of diagnostic tests that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Table 16-8). Particularly noteworthy is the development of multiplex tests for detection of the most common pathogens of the respiratory and intestinal tracts. Despite the complexity of tests, the testing platforms are also undergoing a transformation, moving from the need to have multiple rooms and instruments for specimen processing, nucleic acid amplification, and amplified product analysis to the use of disposable, sealed kits that allow testing on simplified instruments by minimally trained technologists. Leading examples of this approach include BD MAX (Becton-Dickinson, Sparks, MD), BioFire FilmArray (Biofire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT), GeneXpert (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), and Verigene (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL). It is anticipated that this technology will continue to be refined, the menu of approved tests expanded, and the cost and technical ease permitting nucleic acid amplification tests to be performed by most clinical microbiology laboratories.",

Rapid antigen assays used for enteric adenoviruses. NAA tests used to monitor viral load in compromised hosts. Positive SARS CoV NAA tests and antibody results require confirmation by a reference laboratory. NAA tests becoming more widely used for non-SARS CoV. IHC for tissue specimens; shell vial culture rapid and sensitive for nonblood specimens. Detection of inclusions in infected cells may be useful. Quantitative NAA tests and pp65 antigenemia used to assess risk of disease and response to therapy. Serology primarily used to determine prior infection.Serology test of choice for routine diagnosis. NAA tests useful for virus-related tumors. Quantitative NAA tests useful for monitoring viral load in blood of transplant recipients. IHC or ISH can be used on tumor biopsy specimens. Testing confined to specialized laboratories. Antigen and NAA tests key to rapid diagnosis. BSL-4 facility needed for culture, except for LCM. Patients with severe disease may die without developing antibody. LCM diagnosed primarily by serology. Testing confined to specialized laboratories. Serology and NAA tests equally useful for diagnosis. IHC used in fatal cases. BSL-4 facility needed for culture. Isolation difficult. Testing confined to specialized laboratories. Serology and NAA tests equally useful for diagnosis. IHC used in fatal cases. BSL-4 facility needed for culture. Patients with severe disease may die without developing antibody. Serology is the standard diagnostic test. False-positive IgM problematic in low-prevalence areas. Detection of specific viral antigens and antibodies allows for diagnosis and for monitoring the course of infection. NAA tests used to monitor therapy. Serology is used for diagnosis. Qualitative NAA tests used to confirm active infection. Quantitative NAA tests used to monitor response to therapy. Genotyping helps determine duration of therapy. Testing confined to reference laboratories. Diagnosis is relevant only in the presence of hepatitis B infection. IHC of biopsy tissue useful for diagnosis. Serology is the standard diagnostic test. False-positive IgM problematic in low-prevalence areas. NAA test is specific for acute infection but lacks sensitivity. Shell vial used for rapid determination of viral replication. IFA and IHC used for rapid detection in skin or mucous membrane lesions or tissue specimens. NAA test is test of choice for CNS infection. Serology used to determine prior infection. NAA test is test of choice for diagnosis. MAbs available to differentiate virus isolates and for IHC. Serology can document primary infection in children. Serology used to identify infected persons; sensitivity and specificity hampered by difficulty in setting cutoff values. NAA tests of blood may be useful for monitoring KS risk. IHC more specific than NAA tests for KS. Serology is primary diagnostic method; rapid antibody testing becoming more widely available. Proviral DNA and plasma RNA tests used to diagnose neonatal infection. Quantitative RNA tests used to guide therapy and monitor response. NAA is the test of choice for diagnosis. Shell vial culture and antigen detection reagents not yet widely available. Conventional culture difficult. Serology is primary diagnostic method. NAA test useful for virus identification in HTLV Western blot-positive but untypeable specimens. Rapid antigen tests widely used but some are suboptimal in sensitivity and specificity; IFA and rapid culture more sensitive. NAA test most sensitive. Serology useful for epidemiologic studies or retrospective diagnosis. Serology used to diagnose parvovirus B19 in immunocompetent individuals. NAA is test of choice for exposed fetuses and immunocompromised hosts. NAA test can be used to detect human bocavirus. JC virus DNA detection in cerebrospinal fluid useful for presumptive diagnosis of PML. BK virus DNA quantification in plasma or urine used for preemptive diagnosis of PVAN. IHC and EM useful for biopsy tissues. EM is the most useful routine test. NAA tests are also useful. Smallpox isolation requires BSL-3 or BSL-4 and should be attempted only in WHO CollaboratingCenters. Vaccinia virus requires BSL-2 and grows readily in cell culture. IFA performed on fresh and frozen tissue at the CDC for detection of inclusions in infected cells (Negri bodies). Serology used to confirm immunization status and confirm exposure in absence of RIG. NAA test is most useful for non-CNS samples when fresh CNS tissue not available. Rapid antigen tests, especially IFA, more sensitive than culture. NAA test is most sensitive. Serology useful only for epidemiologic studies. Culture still most common test in clinical laboratories. NAA tests are most sensitive. Direct antigen detection or NAA tests are tests of choice for diagnosis. EM useful in suitably equipped laboratories. Serology most useful for diagnosis and determination of immunity. Isolation useful for postnatal rubella if attempted early (prodromal period to 4 days postrash). In CRS, virus can be isolated for weeks to months after birth. Histology most useful diagnostic test. Surrogate markers popular but lack specificity. Western blot for PrP performed in specialized laboratories. Human genome sequencing useful for diagnosis of disorders. IFA and NAA tests are most commonly used rapid tests. Culture less sensitive than IFA or IHC. Serology most useful for determination of immunity. *Virus isolation includes conventional cell culture with detection of viral growth by cytopathic effects or hemadsorption; shell vial centrifugation culture uses immunostaining for detection of viral antigens. Viral antigens can be detected by a variety of immunoassays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, agglutination assays, immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase techniques, and immunochromatography. Viral nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) can be detected and quantified by direct hybridization or by the performance of amplification methods, such as polymerase chain reaction. Electron microscopy involves the visualization of viral particles by negative staining or immunoelectron microscopy or by thin-section techniques. Antibody detection involves measurement of total or class-specific immunoglobulins directed at specific viral antigens.\u2020  A, Test is generally useful for the indicated diagnosis; B, test is useful under certain circumstances or for the diagnosis of specific forms of infection; C, test is seldom useful for general diagnostic purposes.
