            "text": "Cannabinoids are extracted from Cannabis sativa L. and are used for a variety of medicinal purposes. Recently, there has been a focus on the cannabinoid Cannabidiol (CBD) and its potential benefits. This study investigated the safety of a proprietary extract of C. sativa, consisting of 9% hemp extract (of which 6.27% is CBD) and 91% olive oil. The mutagenic potential of the hemp extract was evaluated with the AMES assay inclusive of a hepatic drug metabolizing mix (S9) rich in CYP enzymes. The test article did not elicit evidence of bacterial mutagenicity. GLP compliant 14-day and a 90-day toxicity study were conducted. Olive oil was used as a control. The 90-day study had a 28-day recovery period. Treatments for the 14-day non-recovery range-finding study were 0, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg test article/kg body weight (bw)/day for 14 days. There was a non-statistically significant (p > 0.05) decrease in body weights for the male and female rats receiving the test article. Hypoactivity, hyperactivity, reduced food consumption and piloerection were observed in the rats receiving 4000 mg test article/kg bw. Histopathology showed an increase in the size of liver cells (hypertrophy) around the central vein (centrilobular) in Groups 3 (3/10) and 4 (5/10) that correlated with increased liver weights. In the 90-day study, 8 groups of rats were dosed with 0, 200, 400 and 800 mg test article/kg bw/day. Groups 5 to 8 had a 28-day recovery. There were no test article-linked changes in clinical observations, physical examinations, Functional Observation Battery, ophthalmology, Motor Activity Assessment, hematology, clinical chemistries and macropathology (all groups). With the exception of the liver and adrenal gland, no test article-linked pathology was observed. For all rats receiving the test article, histopathology showed hypertrophy of liver cells around the central vein. The increase of liver weight is most likely caused by hypertrophy due to up-regulation of the hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes. The hepatocellular hypertrophy was completely reversed in 28 days and was not considered to be an adverse effect. Vacuolization of the adrenal zona fasciculata was observed in the control and 800 mg test article/kg bw groups. The vacuolization of the zona fasciculata was of the same incidence and severity in treatment and control male rats and correlated with an increased in the weights of the adrenal glands. In addition, a statistically significant increase (p < 0.05) in adrenal-to-body weight ratios was observed for females receiving 800 mg test article/kg bw. This increase in adrenal-to-body weight ratio did not correlate with any of the pathology findings. The NOAEL for the test article is 800 mg/kg bw/day for female and 400 mg/kg bw/day for male Sprague Dawley rats.",

            "text": "Humans have been utilizing the Cannabis sativa L. plant for millennia for both medicinal and recreational purposes. The C. sativa L. plant originates from Central Asia and has recently seen an increase in interest likely because of its many applications due to the large phytochemical content as well as being a rich source of both cellulosic and woody fibers [1] . Two preparations of marijuana for recreational use are hashish (resinous) and marijuana (leaves and flowers) [2] . Synthetic cannabinoids are emerging as psychoactive substances and have recreational use [3] . Recreational use of marijuana, hashish synthetic cannabinoids are associated with ischemic and other types of strokes [2] . The cannabinoids, which are oxygen containing aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, are one of the most researched groups of all the phytochemicals in C. sativa L. and include at least 70 compounds, of which delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are some of the most well-known [4] . THC and synthetic cannabinoids have affinity for the cannabinoid receptors. CBD does not have affinity for the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) and the cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) and there is animal model evidence to show it modulates the adverse effects of ischemic stroke and likely acts on the sigma-1 receptor [5] [6] [7] . Additionally, CBD, in laboratory animal models, has been shown to be a beneficial treatment in substance use disorder including protection of the liver from alcohol damage [8, 9] . The US government recently passed the Agriculture Improvement Act which included changes to the production and marketing of hemp and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low concentrations of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These changes removed hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, but preserved the US Food and Drug Administrations' (FDA) authority to regulate cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. This study is investigating the toxicology of a proprietary CBD rich hemp extract.",

While the published oral toxicological studies on CBD and hemp extracts are limited, the current available data suggests CBD is safe for human consumption, though additional studies need to be conducted. A review by Bergamaschi et al. [10] described in vivo and in vitro reports of CBD administrations at a variety of dose levels. The authors concluded that several studies support the conclusion that CBD is well tolerated and safe for humans at high doses and with chronic use, but there is evidence of potential drug metabolism interactions (pharmacokinetics), cytotoxicity, and decreased receptor activity (pharmacodynamics). Therefore, the authors also stated additional studies are needed to further evaluate the safety of CBD. A more recent review was conducted by Iffland and Grotenhermen [11] to build on the Bergamaschi et al. [10] review regarding CBD safety and any potential side effects. This review also concluded that numerous studies show that CBD is well tolerated and safe in humans at high doses and with chronic use. However, in order to further understand CBD and validate these findings, additional studies evaluating the safety of CBD are needed. The objective of the current studies was to assess the genotoxicity and preclinical safety of a proprietary hemp extract and to contribute significant safety data on CBD to the currently limited available data.",

(2425 55 th Street, Suite 100, Boulder, CO 80301) and is a proprietary blend of 9% hemp extract and 91% organic extra virgin olive oil, which is produced by an isopropanol extraction method under current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). Fatty acids comprise approximately 88.70% of this extract, while the phytocannabinoid content is 6.96% (of this, 6.27% is CBD); the remaining 4.34% consists of fatty alkanes, sterols, terpenes and tocopherols. Therefore, approximately 100% of the constituents of this proprietary hemp extract are accounted for. An Ames test was conducted on this test article and two additional Ames tests were conducted on undiluted extract, one an isopropanol extract and the other a supercritical CO 2 extract. This was done to determine the impact, if any, of the olive oil on the results. Additionally, this product meets the Federal requirements for hemp products under the Agriculture Improvement Act in regard to THC. The test article used in these studies met the specifications outlined in Table 1 and the cannabinoid content is listed in Table 2 . For the 14-day study, concentration verifications were conducted on study day 1. For the 90-day study, concentration verification analysis samples were collected from the preparations on day 1, day 46 and Day 94, and assayed for the hemp extract.",

For both studies, the rats were 6 weeks of age at the start of the conditioning interval. The acclimation period was 6 days for the 14day study and 12 days for the 90-day study. Criteria used for selecting animals for both studies were adequate body weight gain, absence of clinical signs of disease or injury, and a body weight within \u00b1 20% of the mean within a sex. For the 14-day study, 40 rats were distributed to treatment groups according to stratification by body weight so that there was no statistically significant difference among group body weight means within a sex (Table 3) . Sixty male rats weighing 224-286 g and 60 female rats weighing 170-218 g were distributed to treatment groups stratified by body weight among the dose and control groups (Table 4 ). For both the 14-day and the 90-day studies, body weights were recorded twice during the acclimation period and weekly for the duration of the study. Feed intake was determined at the same day body weights were determined. Filtered potable water and feed (2016CM Certified Envigo Teklad Global Rodent Diet 2 ) were provided ad libitum. Feed and water were assayed for detrimental substances and none were found at levels that would alter study results. In the 90-day study, sentinel rats were kept in the animal rooms.

Blood samples for hematology (except coagulation samples) and clinical chemistry were collected by sublingual bleeding after the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane. Approximately 500 \u03bcL of blood was collected for hematologic parameters in a pre-calibrated tube containing Potassium EDTA 4 anticoagulant and 1000 \u03bcL of whole blood was collected in tubes (no anticoagulant) for clinical chemistry parameters (Table 5) . Whole blood samples were kept cold until examined in the laboratory using standard hematology methods. For clinical chemistry, blood was allowed to coagulate, and the samples were centrifuged in a refrigerated centrifuge. The serum supernatant was harvested and placed in cryotubes, and frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C until thawed and assayed. Hematology parameters were determined on an ADVIA 120 Hematology System (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and clinical chemistry parameters were determined on a COBAS C311 autoanalyzer (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Blood samples used to determine the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were collected immediately before terminal sacrifice by venipuncture of the inferior vena cava during anesthesia with isoflurane. Approximately 1.8 mL of blood was collected in a pre-calibrated tube containing anticoagulant (3.2% sodium citrate). These samples were centrifuged in a refrigerated centrifuge and the plasma was transferred to labeled tubes. Plasma samples were frozen and stored in a -80\u00b0C freezer until thawed and analyzed on a Sysmex CA620 (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The day before collection of samples for the clinical chemistry evaluations, the animals were placed in metabolism cages.

Significant interactions observed between treatment and time, as well as main effects, were further analyzed by a post hoc multiple comparisons test; e.g. Dunnett's test [18, 19] of the individual treated groups to control. When warranted by sufficient group sizes, all endpoints with single measurements of continuous data within groups (e.g., organ weight and relative organ weight) were evaluated for homogeneity of variances [20] and normality [21] .

Means and standard deviations were calculated for all quantitative clinical pathology parameters using Pristima\u00ae version 7 (Statistical Analysis, Xybion Corporation, Lawrenceville, NJ). These data were analyzed in a sequential manner. First, Bartlett's test for homogeneity and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was done. If the Bartlett's test for homogeneity and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality were not significant, a one-way analysis of variance followed with Dunnett's test was performed. If the Bartlett's test for homogeneity and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality were significant then data transformations to achieve normality and variance homogeneity were done. The order of transformations attempted was log, square root, and rank-order. If the log and square root transformations fail, the rank-order was used. When an individual observation was recorded as being less than a certain value, e.g., below the lower limit of quantitation, calculations were performed on one-half of the recorded value. For example, if bilirubin was reported as < 0.1 or \u22640.1, then 0.05 was used for all calculations performed with that bilirubin data. When an individual observation was recorded as being greater than a certain value, e.g., above the upper limit of quantitation, then a greater value was used in place of the recorded value. For example, if specific gravity was reported as > 1.100 or \u22651.100, then 1.100 was used for all calculation performed using that specific gravity value. For all statistical testing, significance was a probability value of p < 0.05.",

C.1.a, 2007) and ICH guidelines [14, 24, 25] . Four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and one strain of Escherichia coli (WP2 uvrA) were used. The studies were conducted in the presence and absence of a metabolic activation system from male Sprague-Dawley rats which had been induced with phenobarbital and benzoflavone (Moltox Inc, USA). The overlay agar and minimal glucose agar plates were purchased (Moltox Inc, USA). The fresh bacterial suspension cultures in the nutrient broth were prepared so that they were in the late exponential phase of growth when used. The test article in olive oil was formulated as a solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to provide the required dose levels of up to 76,335 \u03bcg/plate to account for the 6.55% of active ingredient (6.27% CBD). For the undiluted extract prepared by isopropanol or supercritical CO 2 extraction, the extract was formulated as a solution in DMSO to provide the required dose levels up to 5000 \u03bcg/plate. Positive controls were used, both in the presence and absence of a metabolic activation system. The positive control substances included were sodium azide, ICR 191, daunomycin and methyl methanesulfonate for S. typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1535, TA1537, TA98 and E. coli WP2 uvrA, respectively in the absence of metabolic activation and 2-aminoanthracene for all strains in the presence of metabolic activation. The initial test for all test articles utilized the plate incorporation method in which the following materials were mixed and poured onto the minimal agar plate; 100 \u03bcL of the prepared test substance solutions/negative control/positive control substance, 500 \u03bcL of S9 mix or substation buffer, 100 \u03bcL bacterial suspension or 2000 \u03bcL overlay agar (at 45\u00b0C). The plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C until the growth was adequate for enumeration. A confirmatory test for all test articles was conducted utilizing the pre-incubation method. The test or control substances, bacterial suspensions and the S9 mix or substitution buffer were incubated under agitation for approximately 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C prior to mixing with the overlay agar and pouring onto the minimal agar plates and proceeding as for the initial test. The strains used and dose levels were the same as that in the initial test for all test articles. The plates for both tests were prepared in triplicate for each experimental point. The final doses utilized for the extract diluted in olive oil were 0. 24 Values are mean \u00b1 standard deviation. lawn; the mean revertant colony counts for each strain treated with vehicle was close to or within the expected laboratory historical control range or published values; and the positive controls should produce substantial increases in revertant colony numbers with the appropriate bacterial strain. The plates were also evaluated for cytotoxicity which is indicated by the partial or complete absence of a background lawn on non-revertant bacteria or a substantial dose-related reduction in revertant bacteria.",

[4] , a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) could not be determined, however, the results of a 90-day repeated dose study with a 28-day recovery period in Wistar rats was also reported. In this study, doses of 0 (sunflower oil vehicle), 100, 360 and 720 mg extract/kg bw per day were used. Significant decreases in body weight, body weight gain, and differences in various organ weights, compared to controls, were reported at the mid and high dose levels, but the authors concluded that many of the findings were reversible as they were trending towards normal at the end of the recovery period. A NOAEL for the hemp extract in Wistar rats in the 90day study was determined to be 100 mg/ kg bw per day and 360 mg/kg bw per day for males and females, respectively.",

            "text": "Reported rodent studies have differing findings on hepatotoxicity when CBD is orally administered in high doses [4, 26] . Hepatocellular hypertrophy with a centrilobular pattern was observed in rat livers in the study being reported. This pattern of hepatocellular hyperplasia is frequently observed in rats and other animals exposed to agents that induce the CYP family of enzymes and can be associated with activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) [27] . THC has affinity for PPAR\u03b1, and CBD has very low to no affinity for PPAR\u03b1 and high affinity for PPAR\u03b3 [28] . Interaction with the PPAR\u03b3 is one of the mechanisms of action for CBD. In our study, we did not show the mechanism of action for the hepatocellular hypertrophy. We did show that the activities of liver enzymes in serum were not significantly changed by treatment with the test article and the hepatocellular hypertrophy was reversed during the 28-day recovery period. In the study reported by Marx et al. [4] , no histopathological changes were observed in the livers from the treated and control rats and the liver weights in the male and female rats in the 360 and 720 mg/kg body weight/day were significantly increased (p < 0.05) at 90 days. The 28-day recovery males and females receiving 720 mg/kg/day retained the significantly increased in hepatic weights. The induction of hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes (HDMEs) can be associated with increased liver weights, and hepatocellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia (increased number of cells) and elevation of hepatic-source enzymes in serum. The evidence in the scientific literature supports a conclusion that the centrilobular pattern of hepatocellular hypertrophy and increased liver weights observed in our study was due to induction of HDMEs and/or peroxisomes. No hepatocellular necrosis and changes in the clinical chemistries occurred which is evidence that liver damage did not occur. This conclusion is further supported by not observing hepatocellular hypertrophy and increased liver weights in the 28-day recovery groups that received the test article. Studies in laboratory animals have shown CBD to protect the liver from toxic insults [8, 29, 30] .",

            "text": "The hemp extract in these studies was shown to be non-mutagenic in a bacterial test system used to evaluate mutagenicity. Marx et al. [4] reported on a GLP-compliant study that concentrations of 5,000 \u03bcg/ plate of a CO 2 supercritical extract of C. sativa were not mutagenic in a bacterial test system. Our GLP-compliant mutagenicity testing on the diluted extract showed that concentrations of 76,355 \u03bcg/plate were not mutagenic with and without the S9 metabolic activation. The extracts produced by isopropanol extraction and supercritical CO 2 extraction were not mutagenic with and without S9 metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 \u03bcg/plate. The bacterial test system with the S9 mix did cause mutagenicity providing evidence that mutagenic metabolites were not produced with any of the extracts. The two additional Ames tests conducted on the undiluted extracts produced by two different extraction methods, were conducted to determine if the method of production or the olive oil diluent impacted the results of the Ames assay. No mutagenicity was noted in any of the tests conducted. Other botanical extracts have been evaluated for mutagenicity. Mutagenic studies on extracts from the plant Euphorbia triaculeata showed that it is not mutagenic and provides protection from the mutagenic effects of cyclophosphamide [31] . A study on a novel taste modulating powder derived from Cordyceps sinensis showed this product was not mutagenic in the Ames test and these results were supported in the micronucleus assay [32] . In a study on the genotoxicity of CBD in Caco-2 cells, 10 \u03bcM of CBD did not significantly cause DNA damage after 24 hours of incubation, and CBD was also shown in the comet assay to protect Caco-2 cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage [33] . CBD at an oral dose of 1 mg/kg was shown to significantly (P < 0.05) reduce azoxymethane-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci, colonic polyps and tumors [33] .",

This assessment adds significant data to the currently available literature as to the safety and toxicology of CBD rich hemp extracts. Given the potential of CBD for a variety of human uses and the limited data currently available, these results support that hemp extracts are likely safe human consumption and additional studies should be conducted to validate this conclusion.",

Due to toxicity noted for strains TA100 and TA1537 with the supercritical CO 2 extract, a supplemental test was conducted to ensure five concentrations could be assessed without toxicity. Both the plate incorporation and pre-incubation methods were used as previously described at final doses of 0.5, 2.5 and 25 \u03bcg/plate. Following incubation, the number of colonies per plate was counted manually and/or with the aid of a plate counter. The mean and standard deviation were calculated for each set of triplicate plates.
