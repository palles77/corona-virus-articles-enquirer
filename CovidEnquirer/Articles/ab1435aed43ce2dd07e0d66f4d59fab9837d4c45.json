            "text": "An outbreak of neonatal diarrhea occurred among beef calves (2000 animals) from one large Argentinian farm in 1985. Rotavirus was detected in 78% ( 106/136 ) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in 1.5% of the samples ( 2/136 ) obtained from sick calves. In comparison rotavirus was identified in only 1.6% (1/63) of the samples from clinically healthy calves. The rotavirus strain responsible for the outbreak was characterized as serotype 6 belonging to group A. In the following three years the protective capacity of a combined rotavirus-E, coli inactivated vaccine administered to the dams during the last third of the gestation period was evaluated on this farm by comparison of morbidity due to diarrhea in calves from vaccinated vs. placebo cows within the same year. The morbidity due to diarrhea among calves from dams in the vaccinated and placebo groups was 34% and 77%, respectively in 1986; 23% and 47% in 1987, and 15% and 34%, in 1988. In 1987 morbidity of diarrhea in calves born from vaccinated heifers was 54% and 74% in calves from placebo heifers. In 1988 morbidity from diarrhea was 41% and 54%, respectively among calves in these two groups. In all experiments, calves from heifers showed significantly greater morbidity than calves from cows. Differences in diarrhea morbidity between the vaccinated and placebo groups were statistically significant (P< 0.05 ). Additional studies showed that the diarrhea had a significant influence (P< 0.05 ) on the average live weight of the calves at weaning ( 5 to 7 months ) with an average weight loss of 7.8 kg per calf among the calves affected with diarrhea.",

The progressive decrease of morbidity observed in the vaccinate groups in the three years of evaluation suggests that partial and repetitive vaccination of the population had a negative influence on the amount of virus shed in the field, reducing the possibility of a massive infec-tion of younger highly susceptible animals. This observation would explain the lack of a significant difference between morbidity indexes among experimental groups vaccinated by the 50 or 100% scheme (Experiment 1, Table  1 ). Other investigators (McNulty et al., 1987) also showed reduced diarrhea in conventional calves supplemented with colostrum and milk from vaccinated cows.",

However the total results obtained in Experiment 3 (Table 3 ) following the administration of a single dose of vaccine to cows indicates that this scheme would be efficient in an adult population previously exposed to rotavirus as a preventive treatment for the passive control of rotavirus disease.",

This observation might indicate that the difference in the average age of diarrheic calves in the vaccinated versus placebo groups could be due to a drop in antibody levels passively transferred in the later milk, as was observed by previous investigators (Snodgrass et al., 1980; Saif et al., 1983; Saif, 1985 ) . The possibility that the presence of rotavirus in calves of vaccinated dams was due to atypical rotaviruses or another serotype of group A different from the vaccine serotype (serotype 6) was considered unlikely due to the results obtained by PAGE and seroneutralization tests which showed similarities among all the strains detected throughout the experiments. However, only a percentage of the specimens were analyzed by this test. The fact that the average age of presentation in both animal groups in which a definite infectious etiology was not identified did not overlap entirely with the average age of rotavirus associated diarrhea would suggest the existence of other agents on the farm capable of causing diarrhea in calves between the second and third weeks of life.",
