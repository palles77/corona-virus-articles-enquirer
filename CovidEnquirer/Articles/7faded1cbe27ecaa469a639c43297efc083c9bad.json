In this study, we investigate the presence of PDCoV in diagnostic samples, which were further categorized by case identification (ID), and the association between occurrence, age, specimen and location between March and September 2014. Approximately, 7% of the case IDs submitted from the US were positive for PDCoV. Specimens were categorized into eight groups, and the univariate analysis indicated that oral fluids had 1.89 times higher odds of detecting PDCoV compared to feces. While the 43-56 day age group had the highest percentage of PDCoV positives (8.4%), the univariate analysis indicated no significant differences between age groups. However, multivariable analysis for age adjusted by specimen indicated the >147 day age group had 59% lower odds than suckling pigs of being positive for PDCoV. The percentage of PDCoV in diagnostic samples decreased to <1% in September 2014. In addition, 19 complete PDCoV genomes were sequenced, and Bayesian analysis was conducted to estimate the emergence of the US clade. The evolutionary rate of the PDCoV genome is estimated to be 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 substitutions/site/year (2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 -5.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , 95% HPD). Our results indicate that oral fluids continue to be a valuable specimen to monitor swineherd health, and PDCoV has been circulating in the US prior to 2014.",

Belonging to the order Nidovirales, the family Coronaviridae consists of two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae (Masters and Perlman, 2013) . The Coronavirinae subfamily consists of four genuses, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and the recently identified Deltacoronavirus (Masters and Perlman, 2013) . Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses that contain single-stranded, positive sense RNA with a genome size of approximately 25.4-31.7 kb (Masters and Perlman, 2013) . Five CoVs have been identified in pigs: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). Within the past two years, PEDV and PDCoV were detected in the United States (US) domesticated pig population (Stevenson et al., 2013; Marthaler et al., 2013a Marthaler et al., , 2014b Li et al., 2014) .",

In swine, 10% of the samples were positive for PDCoV and 2 whole genomes were generated. In February 2014, the Ohio Department of Agriculture officially announced the identification of PDCoV in the US. Veterinary diagnostic laboratories quickly developed real time RT-PCR assays to detect the newly identified virus, which had been detected in 9 states (Wang et al., 2014; Marthaler et al., 2014c) . However, the viral pathogenesis and virulence was unknown since clinical disease was not associated with the initial discovery of PDCoV. Nevertheless, pathogenesis and virulence was determined in gnotobiotic and conventionally raised pigs, and severe, watery diarrhea, and vomiting appeared at 48-72 h post infection Jung et al., 2015) .",

Samples were further categorized by age consisting of suckling pigs (<21 days), nursery pigs (21-42 days), growing pigs (43-56 days), finishing pigs (57-147 days) and mature pigs (>147 days). In addition, samples were categorized into 8 groups: environmental, feces, feedback, intestinal homogenate, oral fluid, rectal swab, semen, and miscellaneous, which included bacterial isolates, dried bovine plasma, feed, fluid, FTA card, plasma, RNA, serum, viral isolates, and vomitus.",

In multivariable analyses of grouped data, environment and miscellaneous samples were excluded from the analysis since they are not associated with an age of pigs. Independent variables, age with 5 categories and specimen with 6 categories, were modeled using binary dependent outcome of positive PDCoV. Then, the covariate, state, was introduced into the previous model. The suckling pigs (<21 days) and fecal samples were the predefined-baseline reference. At first preliminary analysis, a warning signal of Quasi-separation was reported. Therefore, Firth's Penalized likelihood logistic regression models were employed to reduce the bias in maximum likelihood estimator for both univariate and multivariable logistic model (Firth, 1993; Heinze et al., 2013; Agresti, 2013) . Comparing model and model selection was based on Penalized likelihood and Akaike information criterion (AIC), and lower values indicate a better fit of the analysis to the results. Finally, relative odds (OR) of PDCoV detection were estimated.",

The number of positive PDCoV samples for each month was estimated using smoothing function. Since the observed number of positive samples in the last three months was near zero and the expected number cannot be lower than zero, a Quasibinomial likelihood method was used to estimate mean-variance relationship and its confidence interval (Agresti, 2013) . Graphics were produced with the R package ggplot2 (Hadley, 2009 ). Computational analysis was performed in (R version 3.2) with different packages as aforementioned (R, 2015) . Statistical differences were considered significant when the p-value was lower than 0.05.

The complete PDCoV genome sequences from the US and South Korea shared a 99.7-100% nucleotide identity while sharing a 98.9-99.3% nucleotide identity with the strains from China and Hong Kong. A time-scaled maximum clade credibility (MCC) phylogeny was inferred for the concatenated open reading frames (24,507 nt). In the phylogenetic tree, the 36 US and single Korean strains group together in a clade (posterior probability = 1.0) (Fig 4) . Viruses from different states are mixed within the tree, evidencing of extensive spatial dispersal of the virus and multiple viral introductions into states such as Minnesota, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois. The diversity of US PDCoV strains traces back to a common ancestor that is estimated to be between August 2010 and September 2012, indicating that PDCoV has recently emerged in the US swine population. The viruses from Asia are not closely related, and inferring the origin country of PDCoV is difficult. The phylogeny is consistent with dispersal of PDCoV from the US to South Korea, although the lack of PDCoV genetic data from other countries makes this inference tenuous. The evolutionary rate of the PDCoV genome is estimated to be 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 substitutions/site/year (2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 -5.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , 95% HPD).

Our results could be further enhanced if individual farm identification was included in the multivariable analysis. However, farm identification was not be included with each case ID. The results of the network connection between veterinarians and swine companies highlight the importance of biosecurity since veterinarians were listed on both positive and negative case IDs. While our results indicate that PDCoV has spread throughout the US, the occurrence of PDCoV decreased to <1% by September, which more accurately reflects the current situation compared to the previous study where the occurrence of positive PDCoV in diagnostic samples was 30% (Marthaler et al., 2014c) .

            "text": "A variety of different specimens were submitted for PDCoV testing by real time RT-PCR. Real time RT-PCR is a valuable tool for detecting pathogens, and more recently, oral fluids have been used to screen for a variety of pathogens, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, influenza A virus, African swine fever, classical swine fever, and foot-and-mouth disease viruses (Detmer et al., 2011; Olsen et al., 2013; Grau et al., 2015) . While the previous viruses are shed in oral fluids, PDCoV is an enteric pathogen. Oral fluids are contaminated with fecal material, and our results indicated that oral fluids had the highest OR associated with PDCoV detection. Pigs constantly chew on a variety of materials including feces. When the pigs chew on the ropes used to collect oral fluids, the feces, which can contain numerous pathogens, is transferred to the ropes. Our results indicate that oral fluids are extremely beneficial to determine if a swineherd is infected with PDCoV, and oral fluids continue to be a valuable tool to monitor the health of swine herds. The detection of PDCoV in oral fluids may explain the higher ORs in growing pigs. Individual samples may be more likely to be taken from suckling piglets while group samples may be taken from older pigs. Piglets are weaned from their mother at approximately 21 days and comingled with a numerous piglets at nursery barns, possibly from multiple different sow farms. The comingling of piglets can contribute to the transmission of PDCoV. If one farm is positive for PDCoV while the other farms are negative, the virus will spread to the negative pigs due to fecal contamination from positive animals. In addition, the maternal immunity diminishes at weaning, which makes the piglets more susceptible to infections (Saif et al., 1994; Sestak et al., 1996) . Numerous viral pathogens including rotavirus A, B, and C, have high co-infection rates in growing pigs (Marthaler et al., 2012 (Marthaler et al., , 2013b . Decreasing the number of enteric pathogens in growing pigs is vital to maximizing feed conversion and weight gain to reduce the number of days to market.",

At this time, it is impossible to infer that the PDCoV strains found in US swine came from China simply because the five Chinese sequences are basal to US diversity. Despite sampling from many geographically dispersed states the diversity of PDCoV found in US swine is restricted (\u226599.7 nucleotide percent identity), which is consistent with the relatively recent introduction of the virus inferred using a timescaled Bayesian phylogeny. The lack of spatial structure observed for PDCoV in the US is also consistent with rapid dissemination of the virus across US state lines, including multiple introductions into a given state. The presence of PDCoV in approximately 2010 is supported by recent serological data, which detected swine PDCoV IgG antibodies in 2010 (Thachil et al., 2014) . The evolutionary rate for PDCoV was estimated at 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 substitutions/site/year and has a similar evolutionary rate (6.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 substitutions/site/year) to PEDV, suggesting porcine enteric coronavirus, including TGEV, may evolve the same within pigs.",
