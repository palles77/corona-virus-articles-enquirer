A retrospective cohort study to ascertain in-fl ight transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and infl uenza-like illness (ILI) was undertaken for 2 long-haul fl ights entering Australia during May 2009. Combined results, including survey responses from 319 (43%) of 738 passengers, showed that 13 (2%) had an ILI in fl ight and an ILI developed in 32 (5%) passengers during the fi rst week post arrival. Passengers were at 3.6% increased risk of contracting pandemic (H1N1) 2009 if they sat in the same row as or within 2 rows of persons who were symptomatic prefl ight. A closer exposed zone (2 seats in front, 2 seats behind, and 2 seats either side) increased the risk for postfl ight disease to 7.7%. Effi ciency of contact tracing without compromising the effectiveness of the public health intervention might be improved by limiting the exposed zone.",

In her address to the United Nations on May 4, 2009 , Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, called for heightened vigilance to limit international spread of the virus (2). Australia's response was rapid, with the introduction of a number of measures as outlined in the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Infl uenza, 2008 (3) . These measures included in-fl ight messages to incoming passengers, use of health declaration cards by all incoming travelers, and mandatory reporting by the pilot on the health status of crew and passengers before landing (4) . The novel virus was also listed as a quarantinable disease under Australia's Quarantine Act 1908, which allows for the application of public health powers for intervention (5) .",

Recent studies on the transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in ferrets demonstrated preference for aerosol and droplet transmission of the virus (15, 16) . A similar study investigating the disease in a tour group in China indicated droplet transmission from coughing or talking with the index case-patient as being the main mode of transmission (17) . The cabin in the A380-800 (fl ight 1) allows for a 10% wider seat in economy class than does the 747-400 (fl ight 2) (18), and modern ventilation systems in aircraft circulate air around bands of seat rows rather than the through length of the aircraft (19) .

Although compliance with the current practice of following up all passengers in the same row as and within 2 rows either side of the index passenger (11) was similar to a recent survey from Switzerland of air travelers in Europe (24), the increased risk of contracting disease as found in the current study would suggest that further limiting of the zone required for contacting exposed passengers could assist in effi cient yet effective public health outcomes.

Four of 9 of passengers in whom pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was diagnosed displayed symptoms prefl ight. This fi nding is similar to that in a recent study looking at the travel patterns of patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 reported from Singapore, where 25% of patients had symptoms before boarding their fl ights (14) . Modeling predicting the global dynamics of disease spread and evidence obtained during the grounding of fl ights in the United States after September 11, 2001 , demonstrated that travel restrictions can delay the intercity spread of infl uenza (25) . Further modeling has shown that the intervention by preventing symptomatic passengers from boarding fl ights, particularly at airports considered major hubs, assisted in delaying infl uenza spread by up to 2 weeks (26) . The control measure of exit screening, combined with the potential value of deterring passengers from travel, also effi ciently restricts the spread of other respiratory illnesses (27) . Potential limitations in this study include lack of knowledge of the health status of passengers who did not return the survey or inform health authorities of ILI symptoms after fl ight arrival, response bias resulting from contact with authorities after fl ight arrival, recall bias caused by the length of time between fl ight arrival and survey response; and potential for contracting an ILI postarrival from a source other than the fl ight. Crosschecking of data collected by local health authorities at the time of fl ight arrival showed no recall bias. Response levels from passengers contacted by health authorities were higher than those not contacted, thereby limiting response bias. The spectrum of signs and symptoms of passengers contracting ILI or pandemic (H1N1) 2009 varies; therefore, if a passenger did not return the survey or contact medical personnel or health authorities after the fl ight, some cases may have been missed (28) . Media coverage of the arrival of fl ight 1 requesting passengers with ILI to contact health authorities was substantial. Although many passengers may be assumed to have then sought medical advice, the number of passengers who were not tested but reported ILI symptoms on their survey indicated this assumption was incorrect. Contracting pandemic (H1N1) 2009 postfl ight from a source in the community was unlikely. There was a small chance of contracting the disease prefl ight because of community transmission for fl ight 1; however, fl ight 2 originated from an area with no documented community transmission. At the time of investigation, community transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was not documented at the arrival port. The likelihood of community transmission is also low because all passengers with confi rmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had symptom onset date within 48 hours after fl ight arrival.",

The fi ndings of this investigation suggest that efforts to prevent importation of respiratory diseases into a community and protection of individuals from in-fl ight exposure to ILI may require changes in international policies of both exit screening of symptomatic passengers prefl ight and contact tracing of those exposed to an ILI infl ight.
