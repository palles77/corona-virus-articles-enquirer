Immune electron-microscopy and immunofluorescence demonstrated that isolates of bovine Breda virus from the U.S.A. were related to the French virus.

            "text": "Recently, a new enveloped virus called Breda virus was isolated by Woode et al. (1982) from diarrheic calf feces in Iowa, U.S.A. Others report the presence of morphologically similar particles in human babies and adults suffering from gastroenteritis ( Moscovici et al., 1980; Vaucher et al., 1982; Lamouliatte and du Pasquier, 1983; Beards et al., 1984; . Several years ago an unclassified enveloped virus, the Berne virus, was isolated from a horse with pseudomembranous enteritis possibly caused by a Salmonella; this virus was studied by Weiss et al. (1983) and shown to be different from coronaviruses and antigenically related to Breda viruses (Woode et al., 1985) . The Berne virus has been proposed by to represent the type of a new family, the Toroviridae, which could include the similar particles seen in human and bovine feces. For several years we have observed Breda-like particles in human gastroenteritis, and these particles could not be cultivated in routine laboratory cell culture such as monkey kidney cells or human diplo'id cells. Because bovine Breda viruses might be more amenable to study, we have examined diarrheic calf feces for these agents. We are now able to specify the major role played by these viruses in the diarrhea of young calves, and to provide further information on the bovine Breda-like agent.",

The large particles might, in fact, be fragments of intestinal epithelial cells. Nevertheless, as enveloped viruses can be very pleomorphic, the possibility that large particles are viruses cannot be ruled out. Small atypical particles with less defined spikes or no spikes probably represent either damaged or incomplete particles. We observed such particles either after purification of Breda viruses and bovine coronaviruses or in Breda-positive cell-culture supernatants.",
