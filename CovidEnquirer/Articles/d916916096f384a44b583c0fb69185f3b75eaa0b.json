Steps should be taken to prevent pregnancy toxemia (maintaining the doe in proper body condition and giving them exercise). Does should be vaccinated for tetanus (Clostridium tetani) and overeating (Clostridium perfringens type C and D) disease 2-4 weeks before kidding. This will increase the level of antibodies to these pathogens in the colostrum and provide protection against these diseases during the first few weeks of life of the kid. In some areas, it may be appropriate to give an injection of vitamin E and selenium. Hay loses vitamins A and E, so injections for does could be warranted. This will add vitamins to the colostrum, which is rich in antibodies (called immunoglobulins) that will be easily absorbed through the intestinal wall after birth.",

This disease causes serious problems for the dairy goat industry and needs to be eradicated. The major route of transmission is through the milk. The disease can also be spread laterally from infected animals in the herd and through bodily secretions. There are two blood tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID)) available to test for the disease, but it has been documented that animals can carry the virus for years without testing positive (due to not producing antibodies against the virus). Therefore, a negative test result cannot be relied upon to indicate that an animal is not infected. However, animals that test positive are infected. One caveat, a kid that consumed pasteurized milk that contained dead CAE virus may test positive for several months. Eradicating the disease requires a commitment to strict management protocols, including biosecurity.",

The kid should be fed heat treated colostrum (heated in a water bath at 56 C for 1 h) for the first few feedings and then should be fed pasteurized goat milk, milk replacer, or pasteurized cow milk until weaning. Milk can be pasteurized by heating to 63 C for 30 min or 72 C for 15 s. Milk must be stirred occasionally as it is heated so that all of it gets up to pasteurization temperature and kills the CAE virus. It is of paramount importance to put safeguards in place so that kids are not accidentally fed unpasteurized milk since several drops may be sufficient to transmit CAE.",

Colostrum is the secretion milked from the udder at the first milking after the doe kids. This milk will have a much higher concentration of antibodies than the second milking. For best results, the kids should receive colostrum in the first 6 h of life when immunoglobulin absorption is highest. Intestinal absorption decreases after 24 h of age. Kids should receive 60 ml of colostrum (heat-treated if on a CAE prevention program) per kg of bodyweight per feeding for three feedings in the first 24 h. Cow colostrum (heat treated) can be used as a substitute. Most commercial colostrum substitutes have not proven to be effective. Successful feeding of colostrum will increase serum total protein to greater than 5.5 g dl \u00c01 or serum immunoglobulin concentration to greater than 1200 mg dl \u00c01 . The sodium sulfate serum turbidity test can be used to ascertain the adequacy of colostrum feeding. Good prenatal care will help to improve the concentration of immunoglobulins in colostrum. It is useful to have frozen colostrum for emergencies. Colostrum can be frozen in an ice tray and cubes transferred to plastic ziplock bags for storage. Colostrum cubes of appropriate weight can be thawed, heat-treated, and fed to kids. Colostrum should not be thawed in the microwave.",

Given free-choice access to milk, kids could consume about 700-800 ml each day in their first week of life, 1200 ml each day in the second week, and 1500 ml each day in the third week. Milk intake will be lower when feeding milk only 2 or 3 times per day. However, feeding large quantities of milk at any one time can cause digestive upsets such as bloat or diarrhea. For this reason, it is preferable to feed three or four smaller meals the first 4 weeks of life or to limit feed milk. An alternative is to provide free-choice cold (5-10 C) or acidified milk, which causes kids to consume numerous small meals throughout the day. Milk or milk replacer can be acidified with dilute formic acid (1 part of 85% formic acid diluted with 9 parts of water) at the rate of 30 ml dilute formic acid to 1 l of milk or milk replacer. This works best if milk is cool at the time of acid addition and the mixture is mixed vigorously. The pH should be maintained between 4 and 4.5 pH paper (test with) to prevent pathogen growth and preserve the milk. Nipple bucket feeders with cooled or acidified milk need only one nipple per three kids in a pen since the kids consume only small meals (Figure 2 ).",

Many calf starters fit these requirements. Hay should be introduced at 2-4 weeks of age and should be of very high quality, such as an immature alfalfa or vegetative stage grass-legume mixed hay. Uneaten hay needs to be replaced twice weekly. Weaning at later ages such as 12 weeks results in a larger kid and ultimately a larger doe, which may have potential to produce more milk, but at a greater feed cost.

By feeding a minimum of grain (less than one-fourth of the diet as grain) and by providing free access to clean water, this may be avoided. Other steps that may be taken to reduce the potential for urinary calculi with high-concentrate diets include increasing calcium-to-phosphorus ratio to greater than 2:1, using only sufficient phosphorus to meet nutrient requirements, using urine acidifiers such as ammonium chloride (0.5-2.0%), and the addition of salt up to 3% of the diet to encourage water consumption.

Animals should be kept healthy since other diseases such as soremouth or coccidiosis will provide opportunity for pneumonia. Stress such as mixing animals should be minimized and good nutrition is also very important. Neonatal diarrhea is caused by several infectious organisms such as Escherichia coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, cryptosporidia, and salmonella. The disease is promoted by a buildup of these organisms in the environment, usually as the kidding season progresses and sanitation is neglected. Kids are more prone to diarrhea when fed large quantities of milk at one time. Insufficient colostrum intake may also be a predisposing factor as is overcrowding. Animals with diarrhea should be strictly isolated to prevent the spread of the organism to other animals. They should be taken care of after healthy animals, and one should be careful not to carry the infection on their clothes or hands to healthy animals. Milk-feeding containers may also spread the disease and need to be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized. Sanitation should be reevaluated and corrected at the first sign of diarrhea. Most of the common causes of diarrhea are self-limiting and therefore antibiotics are seldom used for treatment. Treatment should follow veterinary protocol. Generally, treatment consists of keeping the kid hydrated and warm. Usually, electrolytes are given to the kid in place of milk for several feedings and milk gradually introduced along with the electrolytes. It is best to give milk in small feedings every 2-4 h.

Kids on full feed of milk are at risk for enterotoxemia, especially if the milk is being fed only a few times a day. Sudden changes in feed or feeding routine can also precipitate enterotoxemia. Lush pasture or high-concentrate diets can cause enterotoxemia if the kid is not gradually adapted to them. Feeding high levels of concentrate with insufficient fiber intake from inadequate hay consumption can cause enterotoxemia. The major symptom of enterotoxemia is sudden death. The affected kid has an elevated temperature and severe abdominal pain. As the disease progresses, the animal will lie down on its side with the head down and may have convulsions. It may throw its head over its back. The kid will have diarrhea, and the urine will test positive for glucose if diabetic test strips are used. The disease is best prevented by vaccinating the kid (usually 4, 8, and 12 weeks of age) and by good feed management (gradual changes in feed, sufficient good-quality forage in the diet).",

            "text": "Internal parasites (gastrointestinal nematodes) generally infect kids over a month old. Kids usually acquire infective larvae from grazing, but may acquire some from consumption of bedding. The major strongyles include Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta, and Trichostrongylus colubriformis with Strongyloides papillosus occasionally being a problem, being transmitted through the bedding. Tapeworms (Moniezia species) are an ever present problem in young goats raised in semiconfinement (where they have access to grass since a grass mite is necessary for transmission). When kids are allowed to graze during the warm season, Haemonchus will be the dominant problem in warmer climates and can be particularly deadly. Beginning at 6 weeks of age, fecal samples should be monitored for roundworm eggs every 3 weeks to determine when there is a problem with internal parasites. Symptoms of parasitism include diarrhea, pale mucous membranes, thin, poor-doing animal, and edema. In temperate and tropical climates, one can monitor FAMACHA eye scores during the warm season, which assesses the degree of anemia, which could be assumed due to infection with Haemonchus. One should work with a local veterinarian or parasitologist, who should have a good idea of the species and effective treatments. Deworming all animals by some time schedule promotes dewormer resistance and is unacceptable. In the more humid climates of the United States, there is considerable resistance in parasites to dewormers. Kids raised in confinement where there is no grass growing or those raised on elevated floors are not affected by internal parasites.",

Then, after a successful transition to a diet without milk, the weaned kids may be placed in housing more similar to adults. Therefore, nursing kids should have their own building or at least have an independent ventilation system. For confinement rearing, the floor space and ambient air recommendations can be found in Tables 3 and 4. For kids, up to 2 months of age, it is best to place them in groups of no more than 12-25 kids within 1-2 kg range of weight and no more than 2 weeks range in age. After weaning, kids can be combined in groups of 25-30 allowing for sufficient feeder space, dry bedding, and air quality. One waterer per 25 kids is recommended.",

If raised on browse such as tree saplings, woody shrubs, and broadleaved plants, internal parasites should not be a problem, especially if the hay, concentrate, water, and mineral feeding areas are also kept clean of feces. This is done by offering access to these supplements through a feed space where only the kids' heads may enter for eating. Kid, should be kept separate from adults on pasture to reduce infection by internal parasites. Rotation grazing, especially with a long rest period, reduces parasite infection.",

            "text": "Dairy kids need to be disbudded so that they do not develop horns, since they will injure one another with horns and the horns will not fit into feed mangers. Disbudding at an earlier age is easier on the kid and it is easier for the operator also as compared to horn removal later. The most popular method of disbudding kids is to use a hot-iron dehorner. This is best done when kids are less than 2 weeks old. The hair around the bud may be clipped. Lidocaine may be used as an analgesic under veterinary supervision if deemed necessary. The kid is best confined to a kid-holding box during this procedure. A hot iron is applied to burn a copper colored ring (approximately 6 s) around the horn bud. It is possible to apply the dehorner too long and cause brain damage. Proper dehorning eliminates scurs (which are parts of the horn that are not killed by burning and that grow in unusual shapes). If scurs occur, they can be reburned if they are small (check kids a month later). Kids are often tattooed at this time if they are to be registered. Every kid should be identified by attaching an ear tag or neck chain or collar (Figures 6 and 7) on their day of birth. Because goats and kids like chewing and playing, they can easily lose their tags. To prevent this, an appropriate tag size is recommended, along with a strong material (i.e., metal) and/or a duplicate tag. For LaMancha breed (earless), if a necklace is unsuitable, the tail may be tattooed on the underside.",

Raising replacement kids requires good planning and execution as well as attention to detail. Local veterinary assistance should be involved in the planning stage, especially for health issues. Not only is good nutrition of paramount importance, but also animals should be weighed regularly to verify that kids will be breeding size by breeding season. Raising replacement kids requires much more planning and management than any other class of animals as well as a greater expenditure of time and managerial intensity.",
