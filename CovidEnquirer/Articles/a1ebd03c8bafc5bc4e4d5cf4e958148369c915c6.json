Most descriptive studies of NEC report numbers of cases in a single institution for a designated time period and report the percentage of all neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions with NEC or extrapolate to the number of cases per 1000 live births at a particular institution ( Table 1 ). The incidence of NEC in selected studies has ranged from fewer than 1 % to approximately 5% of NICU admissions, or fewer than 1 case per 1000 live births to approximately 3 cases per 1000 live births at these centers. 2,5,6, 19 ,23,25,36,40,42,53,60,66 Some studies have collected data on NEC from multiple institutions during the same time period. Fewer population-based studies have reported the number of cases in an entire state or geographic region over time ( Table  2 ). In these multicenter and population-based studies, infants with NEC account for 0.3 cases per 1000 live births to 2.4 cases per 1000 live births (median value, 1.3 cases per 1000 live births). 26 ,st, 53 , 75 , 77 If these data are extrapolated to all live births in the United States each year, NEC is clearly an important national problem. With approximately 4 million births each year5\u00b0 and NEC case rates of 0.3 to 2.4 cases per 1000 live births, 1200 to 9600 newborns are estimated to develop NEC in the United States each year (Table 3) .",

In reported clinical series, 62% to 94% of patients are premature. 5 ,l 9 , 25 , 39 , 42 , 66 Several investigators have noted an increased incidence of NEC with decreasing birth weight and gestational age. 20 , 21 , 44 , 53 , 65 , 79 Wilson et al7 5 studied all 148 cases of NEC reported from a single state during a 1-year period. The highest case rates occurred in infants weighing less than 1000 g (42.1 cases per 1000 live births); rates declined with increasing birth weight to 39.0 cases per 1000 live births for infants weighing 1000 to 1500 g, 3.8 cases per 1000 live births for infants weighing 1501 to 2500 g, and 0.11 cases per 1000 live births for infants weighing more than 2500 g at birth. A sharp decrease in the attack rate for NEC occurred at 35 to 36 weeks postconceptual age. 76 These data support the hypothesis that the risk of NEC is determined by maturity of the gastrointestinal tract. Palmer et al 51 studied100 newborn units in the United Kingdom and Ireland during a 4-year period. They reported average annual rates of 0.3 cases per 1000 live births, ranging from 9.5 cases per 1000 live births in infants weighing less than 1000 g to 0.2 cases per 1000 live births for those weighing more than 2500 g at birth. Wiswell et al7 7 studied the records of all infants with NEC born in US Army hospitals from 1980 to 1985. During this 6-year period, NEC developed in 338 of 264,789 babies (1.3 cases per 1000 live births). Case rates were 100 times higher in preterm (16.9 cases per 1000 live births) than full-term infants (0.17 cases per 1000 live births).",

In 1991, the NICHD Neonatal 69 Wide center-to-center differences were found, with percentage prevalence ranging from a low of 3.9% to a high of 22.4% at different institutions. A recent update of their data revealed a minimal change in NEC rates (8% of 1804 VLBW infants) and continued wide intercenter differences (4% to 19%). 30 Rates forinfants weighing501to750 g(9%; range, 2% to 19%)weresimilar to those of larger VLBW infants: 751to1000 g (9%; range, 2% to 25%) and 1001to1500 g (8%; range, 1%to17%), with wide center-to-center differences in each birth weight group as well. The Vermont-Oxford Trials Network reported the experiences of 36 centers (including university hospitals, university affiliates, and unaffiliated hospitals) caring for 2961 VLBW infants. 67 Results were similar to those of the NICHD Neonatal Network: NEC developed in 6% of VLBW infants (ranging from 9% of those weighing 501to750 g to 5% of those weighing 1251to1500 g at birth), again showing variability among centers. The striking center-to-center variability in NEC prevalence found by both networks raises intriguing questions about differences in perinatal factors, birth weight distribution, severity of underlying illness, case identification, infectious milieu, and clinical management.",

Holman et aP 5 used this new ICD code and analyzed data from the National Center for Health Statistics to describe trends in deaths related to NEC among infants in the United States. From 1979 to 1985, 3327 NEC deaths were reported, with an average annual mortality rate of 13.1 deaths per 100,000 live births. Annual mortality rates for NEC decreased during the study period from 14.5 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1979 to 10.2 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1985 (30% decrease). Because ICD coding alone was used to determine the number of NEC-related deaths, this study probably underestimates the total number of deaths (Table 3) . Nonetheless, death rates decreased for male and female infants and for black and white infants. Male infants were more likely to die than were female infants, perhaps reflecting the higher birth weight-specific infant mortality rate reported for boys overall. 34 Black infants were more than three times as likely to die as were white infants. The increased mortality rate for blacks may be due to the increased low birth weight rate among black infants. 50 In another population-based study, Wilson et aF 5 did not find a difference in NEC case-fatality rates between black and white infants after controlling for birth weight.",

In full-term infants, NEC has been associated with congenital heart disease 54 and polycythemia, n, 73 conditions that may compromise gastrointestinal oxygenation, blood flow, or both. In the largest published case-control study of full-term infant NEC, Wiswell et aF 7 found a substantially higher incidence of asphyxia, respiratory distress, intrauterine growth retardation, and exchange transfusion in affected infants than in controls. Because NEC usually develops in full-term infants within a few days of birth, i, 6 s, 77 a causal association between perinatal events and NEC is more plausible.",
