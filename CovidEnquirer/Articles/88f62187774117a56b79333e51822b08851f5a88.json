The first patient was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on December 12, 2019. The symptoms of patients were fever, fatigue, dry-cough and the patients gradually developed severe dyspnea. The majority of them had a good prognosis [2, 3] , while a mortality rate of 2.1% has been recently reported [4] . The average incubation period of the disease was found to be 6.4 days [5] . At present, the diagnosis relies on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or gene sequencing of sputum, throat swab or lower respiratory tract secretion [6] . However, these methods are timeconsuming and do not allow assessing the disease severity. Chest CT scanning can provide rapid screening and assess the severity. In this study, we report the CT characteristics of patients with COVID-19 of various severity to provide a more comprehensive overview of the disease, in order to help the clinical diagnosis and management.",

Seventythree patients with proven COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 41 males and 32 females; aged 5 to 86 years, with mean age of (41.6 \u00b1 14.5) years. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in accordance with the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (fifth edition) formulated by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China [7] . The CT images and clinical data of all patients were collected.
