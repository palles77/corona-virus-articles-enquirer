Accumulation ofmisfoldedprotein in the ER triggers an adaptive ER stress (ERS) response termed the unfolded protein response. Recent interest has focused on the possibility that the accumulation ofmisfolded proteins can also contribute to reproductive response, including preimplantation embryos, testicular germ cell, placenta, and unexplained intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The major ERS pathway constituents are present at all stages ofpreimplantation development and that the activation of ERS pathways can be induced at the 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stage. This review mainly introduced the research progress ofERS induced apoptosis of reproductive cells, providing a new direction for the research of reproductive disease therapy.",

            "text": "In fact, even under optimal conditions, approximately 30% of all newly synthesized proteins are rapidly degraded, most likely because of improper folding. Accordingly, stresses that perturb the folding ofproteins during or soon after synthesis can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and to potential cellular dysfunction and pathological consequences. To avert such outcomes, cells have developed elaborate protein quality-control systems for detecting misfolded proteins and making appropriate adjustments to the machinery responsible for protein synthesis and/or degradation. For experimental purposes, chemicals such as thapsigargin (which depletes Ca 2 + from ER), tunicamycin (which inhibits protein N-linked glycosylation), and dithiothreitol (which disrupts protein disulfide bonds) are used to induce ER stress (ERS) in cultured cells or animals. There are three distinct signaling pathways that are triggered in response to ERS, initiated by protein kinase activated by ds RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring enzyme-I (IREI)( Figure I ). IREI has at least two different actions. First, the endoribonuclease activity oflREI cleaves XBP-I mRNA, converting it into a potent transcriptional activator that, in tum, induces gene expression of proteins involved in protein degradation'v\". Second, recent studies from several laboratories have shown that IRE I links ERS to the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. Specifically, IREI binds to tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and through its kinase activity couples ERS to activation of JNK[5J. The activation of JNK by ERS requires the presence of apoptosis signal regulating kinase-l (ASK1Y6,7]. It has therefore been proposed that ERS induces the formation of IREI-TRAF2 complex that leads to ASKI-JNK activation'?', Some studies have reported that the ERS response occurs several physiological and pathological process, including inflammationl\", the immune responselv'?' in SH-SY5Y cells!'!', and RNA viruses!\", in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease'!\".",

It will be important to elucidate the relationship between alteration of the decidua function and late pregnancy in future studies. Interestingly, passive cigarette smoke during pregnancy, which was reported to induce an ERS response, increases the mean relative area of spongiotrophoblast cells in the placenta and causes IUGR with a reduction in placental blood flOW [30] . Further study demonstrated the formation of a cluster of spongiotrophoblast cells in the labyrinth zone of the placenta of Tun-treated mice. The glycogen content of the fetal liver and placenta from Tun-treated mice was lower than that from control mice. Tun treatment decreased mRNA expression of Slc2al/glucose transporter (GLDT)-l, which is a major transporter for glucose, but increased placental mRNA levels of Slc2a3/GLUT3. Moreover, maternal exposure to Tun resulted in a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-l, VEGFR-2, and placental growth factor. The results suggest that excessive and exogenous ERS may induce functional abnormalities in the placenta, at least in part, with altered GLDT and vascular-related gene expression, resulting in low infant birth weightl\"!

The increased ERS in decidual tissue in pregnancy has been shown to be implicated in fetal growth restriction (FGR)[l3 J \u2022 Sustained ERS acts as a cofactor of oxidative stress in decidual cells from patients with early pregnancy loss!'\". In decidual cells, excessive oxidative stress influences unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways to activate endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (BRAD) by decreasing valosin containing protein, which is a type II ER-associated protein and a member of the AAA \u00b1 ATPase family that facilitates delivery of misfolded proteins to the proteasome, results in cell damage, inhibition ofcell growth, and activation ofapoptosist'\". An investigation ofAbarham et alY6J indicated that the major ERS pathway constituents are present at all stages of preimplantation development and that the activation of ERS pathways can be induced at the 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stage[16]. Luo et alY7] has discovered that the Grp78 promoter is activated in both the trophectoderm and inner cell mass (ICM) of embryos at embryonic day 3.5 via a mechanism requiring the ERS elements. Further stodies indicated that mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Grp78+ 1 -mice are capable of responding to ERS. However, Grp78-'-embryos that are completely devoid of GRP78 lead to periimplantation lethality. These embryos do not hatch from the zona pellucida in vitro, fail to grow in culture, and exhibit proliferation defects and a massive increase in apoptosis in the ICM, which is the precursor ofembryonic stem cells. inositol requiring enzyme-In (IRElu)",

Increased PERK-pEIF2Ot and ATF6 signaling have been associated with decreased cellular proliferation and may contribute to the impaired placental growth characterising pregnancies with FGR and preeclampsia (PE)+FGR[8] by using in vivo imaging analysis and conventional knockout mice, respectively, The research ofIwawaki et al.I2O ]  showed that IREIOt was activated predominantly in the placenta and that loss ofIREIOt led to reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and severe dysfunction of the labyrinth in the placenta, a highly developed tissue of blood vessels. In recent years, TM promote the expression of Grp78, Ire I, Chop, Bax gene and inhibit the expression of Bcl-2, as well as activate the XBP-I splicing to induce bovine granular cell (GC) apoptosis. ERS is present in the process of bovine oocytes in vitro maturation (IVM) and embryos in vitro culture (lVC), supplementing with 500 umol/L taurocholate ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) into the occytes maturation medium or embryo culturing medium may inhibit ERS to facilitate the oocytes maturation and embryonic developmentl\"!Involvement ofERS response in unexplained IUGRERS has recently been identified as a major regulator of cell homeostasis through its involvement in post-translational protein modifications and folding, and its capacity to activate the UPR[21J. Further evidence that the degree of ER stress was greater in the IUGR+PE placentas than in the IUGR alone cases was provided by the fact that levels of GRP94 and CHOP were obviously raised in former, but not in the latter!'!'.

The above analysis indicate that ERS is involved in the pathogenesis of both PE and FGR, but whether the degree ofERS differs between these pregnancy complications is still unknown. Emerging observations indicate that PE and/or FGR may represent more or less severe stages on a continuous spectrum of responses to impaired placentation.Abraham  et aP16] have shown that decidual ERS is increased in pregnancies complicated by FGR and PE+ FGR. In trophoblast-like cell lines, Recently, the result of Iwawaki et a1.l 20] reported that the function of a molecule involved in ERS, IREla in the placenta is essential for placental development and embryonic viability and that ERS and IRE Ia may be involved in other physiological phenomena.

Vaithinathan et alPS] reported that some reproductive toxicants induced testicular germ cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. In the recent reports, Ji's result showed that spliced form ofXBP-I, the target of the IRE I pathway, was significantly increased in testes of mice injected with CdClz. GRP78, an ER chaperone, and CHOP, a downstream target of the PERK pathway, were up-regulated in testes of Cd-treated mice. In addition, acute Cd exposure significantly caused eIF2a and JNK phosphorylation in testes, indicating that the unfolded protein response pathway in testes was activated by Cd. Interestingly, phenylbutyric acid (PBA), an ER chemical chaperone, attenuated Cd-induced ERS and protected against germ cell apoptosis in testes'r\".The further research demonstrated the effects of melatonin on Cd-evoked germ cell apoptosis in testes. Melatonin significantly alleviated Cd-induced testicular germ cell apoptosis.An additional experiment showed that spliced form ofXBP-I, the target ofthe IRE-I pathway, was significantly increased in testes of mice injected with CdClz. GRP78, an ER chaperone, and CHOP, a downstream target of the PERK pathway, were up-regulated in testes of Cdtreated mice. Further analysis showed that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) attenuated the Cd-induced up-regulation of testicular GRP78, an important ER molecular chaperone. Moreover, NAC inhibited the Cd induced phosphorylation of testicular elF2a, a downstream target of PERK pathway. In addition, NAC blocked the Cd-induced activation of testicular XBP-I, indicating that NAC attenuates the Cd-induced ER stress and the UPR. NAC protects against Cdinduced germ cell apoptosis by inhibiting ERS in the testes!\"!",
