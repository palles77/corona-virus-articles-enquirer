            "text": "comprehending pathogenetic mechanisms, it is important to remember always that the neuron comprises both the cell body (\"soma\" or \"perikaryon\") and the cell processes, in particular the axon. The whole cell constitutes a structure concerned with the generation, conduction, and transmission of impulses, and in some cases, a single cell performs this task over a very long distance. For example, in a lumbar dorsal root ganglion of a horse, the cell body of a sensory neuron may project a process distally to the extremity of the hind foot and centrally to the caudal brainstem, making it without doubt the largest cell in the body. If the soma were enlarged to the size of an orange, the processes would have the dimensions of a garden hose and would be >20 km in length. Pathologic reactions within one cell may therefore be separated by considerable distance. Also, neurons function in hierarchical chains organized into anatomic systems.",

The axons are serviced throughout their length by a bidirectional transport system that moves components both away from and toward the soma (anterograde and retrograde transport, respectively). The transport mechanisms are fuelled by the consumption of energy along the course of the axon. Many components are moved in the anterograde direction within 25-nm vesicles by a \"fast\" transport system at a rate of 20-30 mm/hr. The motor for this system, intimately associated with the neurotubules, is an ATPase called kinesin. Larger vesicles of about 500 nm are transported retrograde by this fast pathway, and the translocator is an isoform of dynein, the ATPase that powers cilia and flagella in other types of cell. eminence to congregate on its surface. The functional significance of these migrations and the dynamics of these populations are obscure. It is assumed that the olfactory migrants and their proliferation in situ in the bulb may have a bearing on the development of olfactory neuroblastomas.",

            "text": "Mitochondria are also moved by fast transport, but at a somewhat slower rate. Neurofilaments, neurotubules, and some soluble proteins move by slow transport in the anterograde direction only, at a rate of about 1-3 mm/day, and are degraded when they reach the terminus. Should the operations of the soma or the transport systems be impaired, the health of the axon will suffer and, appropriately, in most instances the largest and longest axons are most vulnerable. Equally, when a neuron is fatally damaged, the whole cell dies, and the consequent changes will spread over the whole extent of its domain. However, long lengths of the axon may degenerate without compromising the viability of the remainder of the cell and without inducing dramatic morphologic change in the soma, and there is often scope for adequate regeneration of the lost axonal extremity. These issues will be addressed more fully later, under Neurodegenerative diseases. The vitality of individual neurons is sustained by their active relationship with other neurons, or other types of cells with which they interact. If a neuron dies, surviving neurons with which it has synaptic connections may regress because of lack of activation, undergo atrophy, and eventually die. This process is called trans-synaptic degeneration, and it will progress along specific anatomic pathways. It is useful also to realize that neurons are extremely diverse pharmacologically and biochemically; this is well illustrated by the highly selective and regionalized effects of different toxins and metabolic disturbances. The selective effects of tetanus and botulinum toxins are good examples.",

As large numbers of developing neurons are superfluous, there is a need to select amongst them and eliminate the excess by apoptosis. Discrimination between those that will survive and those that are effete will depend on the transfer of trophic factors between cells, including from glia to neurons. Around the time of birth, and for variable periods afterward, the latter stages of the process may still be extant, particularly in the cerebellar cortex and paravertebral ganglia. It is probable that the signals between cells during growth and physiologic activity are the same as those, which if overloaded, may lead to neuronal injury.

Thus, in a thorough scan of a histologic section from a senile animal, it might be expected that a few degenerate neurons will be found, even when fixation artifacts are minimal. There is, however, continuous postnatal generation of neurons in some parts of the brain and in at least some species. In species so far examined, neuroblasts generated in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and from the progenitor cells of the subependymal zone between the lateral ventricle and the caudate continue to migrate postnatally to the olfactory bulb. These migrations do not depend on guidance from radial glia, as in the embryonic brain. Rather, the postnatal neuroblasts migrate in a chain designated as the \"rostral migratory stream,\" strictly delineated by rows of astrocytes. There is evidence that new neurons are generated in the olfactory bulb. Axonotomy procedures that sever the pituitary stalk in the rat and some other mammalian species are known to be followed by re-establishment of functional hypothalamic-hypophyseal connections within a few weeks. Cells with neuron-like characters appear to migrate through the neuropil of the median A B C dynamics of axonal flow are remembered, it can be appreciated that such an event will have a major feedback on the soma (retrograde degeneration). In effect, the cell must rearrange its metabolism to adapt to its changed circumstances, and organize for a regenerative effort, involving the reconstruction of an axonal segment greater in volume perhaps than its surviving volume. In this context, central chromatolysis has been termed the axon reaction, and represents an anabolic adaptive response. In this reaction, the nucleus becomes extremely eccentric, and develops a prominent nucleolus and a basophilic cap of RNA on its cytoplasmic aspect. The Nissl substance disperses, and the cytoplasm becomes rich in free ribosomes, lysosomes, and mitochondria. There may also be some increase in the number of neurofilaments. All these changes reflect a shift in metabolic activity, with a switch toward increased synthesis of structural cellular proteins, and a marked decline in synthesis of transmitters. With completion of successful axonal regeneration, the chromatolytic soma returns to normal, sometimes passing through a densely basophilic phase in which it is packed with Nissl granules.",

The initial regressive changes of Wallerian degeneration are similar to those described for the peripheral nerves, although they proceed over a longer time course. This is because the involvement of hematogenous macrophages is slower and less intense in the CNS, and activated microglial cells undertake most of the work. Axonal sprouting and some remyelination can occur. However, the poverty of the regenerative response results mostly in the permanent disappearance of the axons, myelin, and oligodendrocyte cell bodies. Some of the myelin debris may be phagocytosed by reactive astrocytes, and their processes extend to fill the vacancy, creating a ramifying network of astroglial scar tissue. Wallerian-like degeneration in the CNS is most commonly seen in the spinal cord, diameter is distinctly reduced at the nodes of Ranvier, and these \"strictures\" are probably the reason that paranodal swellings filled with transported vesicles and organelles are a feature of many axonopathies in which transport has been disturbed.",

When the soma is uninjured, there is potential for regeneration and, in peripheral nerves, this may be complete. Should the acute injury involve death of the cell body, then Wallerian degeneration of the axon will proceed as part of the dissolution of the entire neuron. The classic scenario for Wallerian degeneration is acute focal mechanical injury in a peripheral nerve, which effectively transects axoplasmic flow. Within 24 hours, the distal segment begins to degenerate fairly evenly along its length (anterograde degeneration). Focal eosinophilic swellings occur, often containing accumulations of degenerate organelles, and then fragmentation becomes evident by 48 hours or so. Schwann cells respond rapidly as myelin sheaths are made redundant by disintegration of the axon. Initially, myelin retracts from the nodes and then forms into ellipsoids, regarded originally as \"digestion chambers\" for the enzymic lysis of the axonal fragments . The myelin itself condenses into aggregates and fragments and, together with remaining axonal debris, becomes the target of invading macrophages. Prior to this, the complex myelin lipids are progressively transformed into simpler neutral lipids over a period of 10-20 days, and this is reflected in the reaction to specific lipophilic stains. Macrophages enter the sheath and soon become filled with sudanophilic droplets. These lipid-laden cells may persist in the interstitium for many weeks. Some of the myelin debris is phagocytosed by Schwann cells themselves, and they begin to proliferate. As the debris is cleared away, proliferating Schwann cells form bands along the former course of the myelinated axons (B\u00fcngner's bands). Similar Wallerian changes occur proximal to the site of injury over several internodes. If conditions are favorable at the site of injury, sprouts from the axonal stump will find their way along the Schwann cell bands and be directed to their correct destinations. In most instances, the growing regions. It is a pattern less likely to be encountered in natural animal disease than the distal variety. It is perhaps best exemplified by the large fusiform swellings, torpedoes, seen on the proximal axonal segments of cerebellar Purkinje cells in the mycotoxicosis of perennial rye grass poisoning and some storage diseases . Such lesions may develop in central or peripheral axons and be associated with genetically determined or acquired disease. Proximal axonal swellings caused by the accumulation of neurofilaments are a feature of several neurodegenerative diseases. A defect in the transport of phosphorylated neurofilaments results in the accumulation of masses of them, where they cause large, amphophilic axonal swellings. The fundamental pathogenesis remains undefined.",

They are therefore frequently seen in and around relay nuclei in the brain, and in peripheral endings. The spheroids in axonal dystrophy can become extremely large, >100 \u00b5m in diameter, and are filled with accumulations of normal organelles, degenerate organelles, and abnormal membranous and tubular structures. In H&E sections, their appearance can be variable ( Fig. 4-9A , B); some are densely eosinophilic, and either smooth or granular or vacuolated; others may be pale with central denser-staining cores; some may have a basophilic hue and evidence of focal mineralization. However, the swellings are not usually associated with any marked reaction on the part of surrounding elements and only rarely are seen to be undergoing fragmentation and dissolution. They are long-lasting, in contrast to the spheroids of acute axonal degeneration. Thinning of the myelin sheath around spheroids will occur as lamellae slip to accommodate the focal axonal enlargement (Fig. 4-10) . The pathogenesis is unclear, but evidence points to a disturbance of retrograde axonal transport. The lesion is a common finding in the relay nuclei of the caudal brainstem in old age, and is a frequent accompaniment to neuronal storage diseases. It is the principal optic tract, and brainstem.

Biochemically, central myelin is largely composed of cholesterol, galactocerebroside, and phospholipids, together with a number of distinctive protein constituents. The most abundant of these is the proteolipid protein (PLP), with lesser amounts of myelin basic protein (MBP), and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). PLP is concentrated at the intraperiod line, MBP on the cytoplasmic face of the major dense line, and MAG at the axoplasmic-myelin interface. They probably play an important role in maintaining the stability of the sheath. Other antigens are expressed by oligodendrocytes and myelin sheath, including the transcription feature of diseases known as neuroaxonal dystrophies, of which several are recorded in the veterinary literature. In several such diseases, the topography of the axonal dystrophy seems to fit the clinical deficits, but there is evidence that, in many situations, even intense development of the lesion has (Courtesy S.U. Walkley.) between the two in appropriately stained sections of the spinal cord-spinal nerve interface. This chemical difference is reflected in antigenic differences; the major protein is termed Po and is distinct from PLP, as is the basic protein P1 from MBP. Schwann cells are able to replicate prolifically, to phagocytose damaged myelin, and to remyelinate newly regenerated or previously demyelinated axons. This replicative ability means that the loss of a proportion of the cells may be compensated. The peripheral myelinated axon is therefore a much more resilient structure than its central counterpart. The general principles of the axon-myelin relationship, as outlined for the CNS, still apply, however. Destruction of Schwann cells will result in the disintegration of the dependent myelin.

Signals from Schwann cells influence the development of all components of the nerve and endoneural and epineural connective tissue and the Schwann cells themselves. Schwann cells develop from the neural crest as 2 different cell types, myelinating and nonmyelinating. This differentiation is reversible, which is consistent with the absence of precursors in mature nerves regenerating after injury. If mature Schwann cells lose contact with axons, as occurs in nerve injury, the cells undergo regression and the myelin disintegrates.

There is abundant field and experimental evidence that the effects of teratogens are manifested in the nervous system with disproportionately high frequency. One explanation is that the high degree of differentiation and complexity of the CNS give it an increased susceptibility to developmental disturbances. In addition to inherited diseases, a large number of infectious and toxic environmental agents are capable of causing anomalies. The cause of malformation in an individual domestic animal fetus is seldom determined, in part because of the long time lapse between the initiating event and the fetal presentation. The most frequent sporadic anatomic abnormalities are neural tube defects, and these are initiated in a narrow time range: embryonic days 8.5-10.5 in the mouse, days 15-18 in the pig, and days 21-28 in humans. Congenital abnormalities of the CNS consist of deviations in either the nature or velocity of the developmental process. Several main patterns of abnormal development can be recognized. \u2022 The largest category includes those disorders with a morphologic basis that are a consequence of failure or disorder of structural development. Many such abnormalities are recognizable by distinctive gross changes, but others require microscopic examination. \u2022 Some conditions appear to represent retardation of normal development rather than structural aberrations. \u2022 Disturbance of the normal development may also manifest as premature senescence or degeneration of formed tissues, such as the various forms of neuronal abiotrophy. \u2022 Some congenital abnormalities appear to represent primary disturbances of function rather than of tissue structure.

The varied arrangements may reflect the need to allow passage of interstitial fluid to the local lymphatics. In diffuse inflammatory or neoplastic diseases, this space, more potential than real under normal conditions, becomes patent and accumulates reactive and invading cells. The tendency for these cells to be confined to the space gives rise to the neuropathologic term perivascular cuffing ( Fig. 4-17A, B) . The size of cuffs is usually related to the size of the space, and they may vary from one cell thick around the smallest venules to 10-12 or more cells thick around the larger vessels. Perivascular cuffing is classically seen in inflammatory conditions, and all classes of reactive leukocyte may be seen depending on the cause. Although most of the cells are of hematogenous origin, there is no doubt that in some diseases, enteroviral infections, for example, they may arise largely from the proliferation of adventitial cells or resident histiocytes. Lymphoid perivascular cuffing is a feature of many viral encephalitides.

Such cytolytic effects have been demonstrated with neural defects induced by viruses and chemicals as well as by physical agents such as hyperthermia. In the case of viruses, cellular destruction can be a direct consequence of infection but may develop as part of the inflammatory reaction. The toxicities of many drugs are mediated not by the compounds themselves but by highly reactive metabolites. If they are not detoxified, these unstable metabolites interact covalently with cell macromolecules and may kill affected cells. Cytolysis seems to be the common operative mechanism in a number of important malformations that often have gross features, such as the cavitating cerebral defects and cerebellar hypoplasia. Teratogens may sometimes act by inhibition or distortion of normal cellular development and function to most frequently recognized functional disorders are those that arise as a consequence of inherited biochemical defects and that cause distinctive neurohistologic changes. This category is exemplified by the various lysosomal storage diseases and the leukodystrophies. \u2022 Neither an anatomic nor a biochemical basis has yet been identified for a number of congenital neurologic diseases that often appear to be inherited, for example, idiopathic epileptiform conditions in various species. The initial steps in the formation of the CNS take place early in embryogenesis. As soon as the germ layers are established, the neural plate, a thickened band of ectoderm, develops along the mid-dorsal line of the embryo, and is the primordium for the brain and spinal cord. Differential growth at the margins and in the mid-plane result in folding of the plate to form a neural groove bounded on each side by an elevated neural fold. The groove continues to deepen, and the neural folds meet dorsally and fuse, likely beginning at multiple sites, to form the neural tube, which simultaneously separates from the superficial ectoderm. Physical properties of cells and tissues both inside and outside the neural plate determine the formation of the neural tube (neurulation). Cellular proliferative activity within the neural tube is concentrated within an inner subependymal or germinal layer of actively dividing neuroectodermal cells that, with differentiation and outward migration, gives rise first to neurons and later to glia.",

Segmentation and development of the axial skeletal investment of the nervous system depend on the developmental integrity of the neural tube. Hence, NTDs also involve malformations of overlying bony or soft tissues. The spectrum of NTDs includes anencephaly, encephalocele, spinal dysraphism, and meningomyelocele.

Anomalies of the same general or specific pattern vary considerably from case to case in the details of their expression, various combinations of typical malformations occur, and produce more subtle developmental deviations, such as hypomyelinogenesis. Infection of calves with bovine viral diarrhea virus, of lambs with border disease virus, and of piglets with classical swine fever virus may provide instances of noncytolytic disturbance of fetal neural development of this type. Some drug metabolites, rather than killing cells, result in mutations through binding to nucleoprotein. In view of the multiplicity of pathogenetic pathways that have been identified, it is not surprising that a spectrum of pathogenic effects can result from the action of one teratogen.

Such diversity of teratogenic expression is illustrated by the wide variety of neural and extraneural defects found in kittens born to cats exposed to griseofulvin in pregnancy.

Necrosis of groups of cells occurs in normal development and may be seen in association with remodeling processes. The immature nervous system does not react to damage in the same way as adult tissue. Parts may be absorbed without a trace of connective tissue or neuroglial repair. Furthermore, severe malformations are unlikely to proceed directly from destructive processes because destruction of parts of the embryonal structure removes the inductor and inhibitor influences on neighboring cell groups. This may, in some instances, lead to arrest of normal processes and, in others, to exuberant reparative proliferation of neuroepithelium that is indicated histologically by the formation of distinctive neuroepithelial rosettes. Thus malformations may be compounded of degeneration, necrosis, inhibition, overgrowth, and repair. There is, at best, only a general correlation between the nature of an anomaly and the time in development when it was initiated. In retrospective studies of malformations of unknown cause, it is only possible to identify the latest time at which the malformation may have been produced, based on the normal development of the nervous system of the species in question.",

However, the immunologic status of the fetus, particularly its capacity to produce neutralizing antibody, is likely to be important in determining the character of the neural lesions resulting from viral infection. Lesions leading to major anomalies tend to occur prior to the fetal age at which the fetus can mount a serum neutralizing antibody response to infectious agents. The fetal brain, especially in the early stages of development, has limited inflammatory potential, but viral-induced destruction of neural tissue in the early fetus may be accompanied by an intense macrophage reaction despite lack of immunologic maturity. Such necrotizing processes typically produce gross anatomic defects with little or no evidence of inflammation because of subsidence of the inflammatory changes. In older fetuses, cytolytic processes are reduced mainly by absence of a susceptible cell population rather than by immune mechanisms, but nonsuppurative encephalitis frequently persists as a residual lesion.",

Vascular damage with consequential edema and necrosis is one such mechanism. Although the dehiscence of the neural tube from the embryonic ectoderm and, in consequence, focal failure of development of the axial skeletal encasement. The herniations are related to suture lines and are almost always median. They vary from 2-10 cm in diameter, and the largest diameter is always much larger than the diameter of the cranial opening. The skin forms the hernial sac, and ectopic bits of disorganized neural tissue may be attached to it; the dura mater does not form in the areas of defect. Encephalocele and meningocele usually occur in the frontal regions (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) , but some are occipital, and these latter tend to be located below the occipital crest. Occipital encephaloceles may also be associated with spina bifida of the upper cervical region, sometimes with enlargement of the foramen magnum and absence of the arch of the atlas. Ethmoidal meningoencephaloceles have been documented in dogs and consist in unilateral or bilateral rostral herniation of the olfactory bulb through a defect in the cribriform plate. there is considerable variability in the development of morphologic sequelae. The primary defect in cerebral aplasia is arrest of closure of the rostral portion of the neural tube. There is, in consequence, failure of development of the cranium and, with skin lacking over the lesion, the dysplastic rudiments of neural tissue are exposed to the amniotic fluid (exencephaly), leading to degeneration of neural tissue and the typical appearance of anencephaly in late gestation. Cerebral aplasia is seldom complete from the beginning because the eyes, either well developed or present as rudimentary vesicles, are present. When the eyes are rudimentary, ganglion cells and optic fibers may be missing. The cranial and neural defects are probably more or less proportionate. With severe degrees of cerebral aplasia, or true anencephaly, there may be complete failure of cranial development (acrania), or there may be rudimentary development of the occipital and adjacent bones. In those cases of cerebral aplasia in which the rostral portion of the brainstem is present, there may be a greater degree of cranial development but failure of fusion (cranioschisis). The base of the cranium is well developed, but there are a variety of anomalies of basal bones and no sella turcica. The neurohypophysis is absent, and the adenohypophysis is either absent or unidentifiable. Failure of development of the neurohypophysis can be responsible for the failure of the adenohypophysis to develop normally, and this in turn may be responsible for prolonged gestation of some anencephalics. The caudal extent of the neural tube defect varies greatly. There may be involvement of the cervical vertebrae or of the entire neural tube (craniorhachischisis totalis); the defect is always continuous, not segmental. Even when the spinal cord is closed, it may be hypoplastic. When the cord is well developed, it is still small because of the absence of descending tracts.",

With the establishment of the telencephalic vesicles, cortical neurogenesis begins from the germinal epithelial lining the neural tube, especially in those parts destined to become the lateral ventricles (subventricular zone). Initially, cell division gives rise to similar daughter cells that also act as progenitors so that cell numbers increase geometrically. Later, the cell divisions become increasingly asymmetrical as an increasing proportion of progenitors produce postmitotic precursors of neurons. The first postmitotic neurons migrate to the subpial plate along guides produced by radial glia that extend from the periventricular zone to the cortical surface (radial migration). Successive waves of migratory neurons will leapfrog the preceding waves such that the first waves will reside in the deeper layers of the cortical plate corresponding to layer 6 of the mature cortex, and the later waves will migrate to form the more superficial layers. Other populations of migrating neurons move in trajectories orthogonal to the radial glia palisade (tangential migration). This mode of migration is typically adopted by cortical interneurons and Cajal-Retzius cells, which represent a transient neuronal cell type localized in the marginal zone of the developing neocortex. They are a major source of the extracellular matrix protein reelin, which is essential for the laminar development of the cerebral cortex.",

A small amount of CSF passes into the central canal of the spinal cord from the fourth ventricle. The greater part of the fluid flows forward into the cerebral subarachnoid spaces and basal cisterns; the balance circulates in a restricted fashion in the spinal subarachnoid space. The energy required to circulate CSF is imparted largely by the choroid plexuses through their production of fluid. The arterial pulse also contributes to CSF movement through associated variations in hemispheric volume. Venous resorption of CSF occurs where arachnoid villi form in the walls of the larger meningeal veins. Transfer of fluid is effected by hydrostatic pressure, with reflux being prevented by the valvular nature of the villi. The arachnoid villi are normally highly permeable, being able to permit the passage of red blood cells. Impedance of this resorption appears to contribute to the increased intracranial pressure of hypovitaminosis A in calves. Some outflow in dogs can occur via the cribriform plate and in cats along the subarachnoid space of olfactory, optic, and acoustic nerves, but significant outflow may possibly occur only in association with raised intracranial pressure.

The lateral and third ventricles are most severely affected, and there may be no alteration in the fourth. With ventricular dilation, parenchymal atrophy affects chiefly the white matter and the cerebral cortices; ventrally, the increased pressure is buttressed by the basal ganglia. The corpus callosum is elevated and thinned, and the cerebral cortices over the vertex may be reduced to thin shells of gray matter. The floor of the third ventricle is extremely thinned, the hypophysis is atrophied, and the cerebellum is compressed and displaced caudally.

In this layer, cells proliferate rapidly and differentiate into microneurons, such as basket cells, stellate cells, and granule cells, which migrate into the folium to their definitive locations. This proliferation, differentiation, and migration begins late in gestation and continues for a few weeks postnatally in most species. Normal cerebellar cytoarchitectural development, including the maturation and localization of Purkinje cells, is dependent upon these microneurons establishing orderly synaptic connections.",

That the destructive process may be augmented by vascular damage has been demonstrated for bovine viral diarrhea virus. Classical swine fever virus possibly acts through inhibition of cell division and maturation. In puppies, segmental cerebellar dysplasia may result from postnatal infection with canine herpesvirus. Because the growth behavior of the subependymal cell plate has features in common with the external granular layer of the cerebellum, residual lesions attributable to this site of infection, such as cavitating defects, may be associated with cerebellar hypoplasia, particularly in cases of viral origin.",

In some cases, the cerebellum may appear grossly normal, the hypoplastic defects being detectable only on microscopic examination. In such cases, the defects are irregular in distribution, although there is a more or less severe loss of Purkinje cells. The granular layer is here and there narrowed and deficient in cells, but the molecular layer is normal. Correlative lesions may be present or absent and, when present, may be asymmetrical; they occur chiefly in the deep cerebellar nuclei, olives, and cerebellar peduncles. At the other extreme, the cerebellum may be represented only by a small nubbin of tissue or 2 unconnected nubbins, each related to a hypoplastic peduncle. In these severe defects, there is no folial pattern or division into lobes. Intermediate degrees of cerebellar hypoplasia are, however, the most common. It is usually possible to recognize with the naked eye that the cerebellar peduncles are diminished in size, especially the brachium pontis; that the medullary pyramids are flattened; and that the small size of the restiform bodies gives the fourth ventricle a flattened appearance. Microscopically, the cerebellar cortex is disorganized. A brief description is not possible because the pattern varies greatly from case to case and place to place in the one animal. The Purkinje cells and the cells of the granular layer are the most obviously deficient and, in those that are present, regressive changes are common.",

Lesions are very similar to those induced by AKAV and include arthrogryposis, brachygnathia inferior, torticollis, kyphosis, lordosis, scoliosis, cerebellar hypoplasia, hydranencephaly, porencephaly, hydrocephalus, and micromyelia ( Fig. 4-36A , B). Histologic lesions include lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis in fetuses that survive infection early in gestation, glial nodules mainly in the mesencephalon and hippocampus of lambs and goats, and neuronal degeneration and necrosis mainly in the brainstem of calves. Micromyelia is characterized by a loss of gray and white matter, with few neurons remaining in the ventral horn in calves. The skeletal muscles of lambs and calves show myofibrillar hypoplasia. Although SBV can be detected in different regions of the CNS of aborted lambs and calves, brainstem seems to be the most appropriate tissue to maximize the likelihood of SBV detection by PCR.",

Iriki virus, a strain of AKAV, has similar pathogenic potential. Following maternal infection at critical stages of gestation, AKAV produces a range of predominantly neural abnormalities in calves, lambs, and kids, but AKAV is best known for producing outbreaks of arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly in calves. Epizootics of Akabane virus disease in cattle have been reported in areas of Japan, Israel, and Australia. The vector in Australia is the biting midge Culicoides brevitarsis, and the virus has also been isolated from mosquitoes in Japan. Buffaloes, horses, and pigs are additional vertebrate hosts. Although arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly may be the most obvious manifestations in field epizootics of bovine AKAV disease, a range of overlapping syndromes is observed in calves in affected herds. The pattern of fetal disease corresponds to the gestational age of the fetus at the time of infection. Infection late in gestation may cause abortion. The initial manifestation of neural abnormality in a field outbreak is the birth of incoordinate calves and, in this group, nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis is evident on histologic examination. Microencephaly and cerebellar hypoplasia occur occasionally as manifestations of late infection. Arthrogryposis, sometimes associated with spinal deformities, appears early in the outbreak following fetal infection at 5-6 months of pregnancy. In arthrogrypotic calves, there is loss of spinal ventral horn neurons, loss of myelin in the motor tracts of the spinal cord and in ventral spinal nerves, and denervation atrophy together with fibrous and adipose replacement of skeletal musculature. At least some strains of AKAV have the capacity to cause polymyositis, particularly in the early myotubular phase of skeletal muscle development, suggesting the possible involvement of this process in the arthrogrypotic change. Severe hydranencephaly, manifest clinically as blindness and stupidity, is seen toward the end of the epizootic, being the result of fetal infection at 3-4 months of gestation. With increasing age ",

Border disease (BD) of lambs was first described from the border counties of England and Wales, and is now recognized in many countries. Affected lambs show gross tremors and long hairy birth coats (\"hairy-shaker,\" or \"fuzzy\" lambs). BD is caused by species Border disease virus (BDV), genus Pestivirus, family Flaviviridae, which is very closely related to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and less closely to classical swine fever virus. These viruses possess a similar host spectrum experimentally, and interspecies transmission, especially between ruminants, does occur naturally, but the clinical expression in recipients may be modified or absent. The ecology of BDV and the pathogenesis of BD depend on the ability of the virus to cross the placenta and then either to produce disease in the fetus or a state of immuno tolerance and persistent infection (PI) that allows excretion of the virus continuously in postnatal life. Strain variations of BDV, with differing host responses depending on breed and genotype, and gestational age at which infection occurs, contribute to the varied manifestations of the disease. Congenital disease and PI are typically caused by the noncytopathic biotype of BDV; mucosal disease-like syndrome is caused by a cytopathic biotype of BDV. Sheep can also be infected naturally with BVDV types 1 and 2, and BVDV is capable of producing the BD syndrome in sheep and goats. Pigs can be naturally infected by BDV, for example, strain Frijters, which can confuse identification of classical swine fever.",

The age-related immune capacity of the fetus is the important determinant of the nature of the disease produced. In the case of infections occurring within the first half of gestation, the result may be fetal death and abortion. Alternatively, the fetus may survive, frequently carrying an immunologically tolerated infection. In this event, the virus persists in fetal tissues, and postnatally the lamb fails to produce specific antibody. Such PI sheep harbor the virus for prolonged periods, are chronic excretors of the virus, and readily transmit infection. Lateral spread is important in the field and, although the virus can be seen, as such fetuses die in utero and undergo autolysis. Necrotizing inflammation can involve a variety of tissues. The reactive changes are dominated by mononuclear, predominantly macrophage, infiltration of hepatic portal areas, myocardium, spleen, and lymph nodes, which is reflected grossly in enlargement, nodularity, and mottling of the liver and enlargement of spleen and lymph nodes. The presence of growth-arrest lines in long bones suggests that the fetus undergoes one or more intrauterine crises before death. Affected fetuses may have partial alopecia that spares the tail, the lower portion of the limbs, and the head, these being points of initial hair growth during fetal development. The microscopic skin changes that evolve from the initial necrotizing dermatitis and correlate with the alopecia are hypoplasia of hair follicles and cystic distention of adnexal glands.",

One type of molecule will be the major stored substance, but often the stored material will be somewhat heterogeneous, as the enzymes are linkage specific rather than substrate specific. Thus the morphologic hallmark of lysosomal storage disease is the presence of distended cells, crowded with vacuoles bounded by single membranes containing the stored material; these vacuoles react enzyme-histochemically for acid phosphatase or other lysosomal hydrolases. They represent the adaptive hypertrophy of the lysosomal apparatus. In some cases, the morphology and histochemical reactivity of the stored substance may fairly clearly indicate its nature, for example, glycogen. Lectin histochemistry may also be useful for characterizing stored material, exploiting the avid carbohydrate-binding properties of these agglutinating proteins in combination with a visualizing system.",

This is the basis of the inherited lysosomal storage diseases in humans and animals, most of which are transmitted as autosomal recessive, and some as X-linked, traits. The deficiency in activity may come about via a total absence of enzyme protein caused by a mutation of the nuclear gene that produces no mRNA or produces mRNA leading to a defective or unstable enzyme, via a defective post-translational modification of the lysosomal enzyme, or via the absence of a specific activator protein required by some enzymes for the initiation of activity. These activators are small-molecular-weight, heat-stable proteins that function as detergents. They may interact with either the enzyme or its substrate. In the category of defective enzyme protein, one could also include the rare mechanism in which the enzyme lacks the specific molecular tag required to direct it, following its synthesis, to the lysosomal compartment; it is therefore immediately excreted from the cell, and the lysosomes remain deficient in that enzyme activity.",

Within all cells, except mature erythrocytes, normal catabolism directs a steady stream of endogenous macromolecules into vesicular compartments for degradation to simple molecules that may be reused or excreted. These essentially autophagic pathways, through which each cell recycles its own constituents, may also receive endogenous and exogenous molecules from the extracellular milieu, taken up by endocytosis or phagocytosis. Storage states, or disorders, are characterized by the accumulation of material(s) resistant to or exceeding the capacity of the machinery of intracellular digestion, disposal, or transport. Hemosiderosis and some types of hepatic lipidosis are common examples of the storage of physiologically normal substances resulting from the overloading of essentially normal, biochemically competent cells. A storage disease, by contrast, can be regarded as a storage process with a primary pathologic basis within the storing cells, and with potential for the perturbation of their function. The implication is that the catabolic machinery of the cells is fundamentally incompetent.

In spite of this, the cell limits the sites of storage to the soma and some of the larger dendritic stems. As a result, the soma becomes greatly distended and the cell outline rounded and swollen, rather than angular ( Fig.  4-37A , B).

The lysosomal pathway degrades any glycogen that finds its way into autophagic vacuoles, whereas the other pathways are more related to metabolic mobilization of glycogen. In humans, 8 different glycogen storage diseases have been identified, with the lysosomal type being classified as type II, Pompe disease. As the storage process is very widespread in this disease, it is also referred to as generalized glycogenosis. In most other types, storage is concentrated in liver and muscle. \u03b1-1,4-glucosidase deficiency has been well documented in Shorthorn and Brahman beef cattle. The disease has autosomal recessive inheritance, and at least 3 disease-associated mutations occur. Affected calves have severe clinical signs by about 1 year of age. The most damaging effects are produced in the skeletal and cardiac muscle; weakness and congestive cardiac failure are clinically dominant, and cardiomegaly and hepatomegaly evident at autopsy. There is widespread glycogen storage, much of which occurs in typical lysosomal storage vacuoles, but some of which is intracytoplasmic. Swollen, vacuolated cells contain diastase-sensitive, PAS-positive material, which is ultrastructurally typical of glycogen. Vacuolar myopathy and cardiomyopathy are prominent; neuronal storage is universal and severe and is accompanied by glial storage, with numerous axonal spheroids in the vestibular and cuneate nuclei, terminal fasciculus gracilis, and throughout the spinal cord gray matter (see Fig. 4 -8). Mild Wallerian degeneration may be present in the lateral and ventral columns of the spinal cord and in some peripheral nerves. The variation in features of NCL is illustrated by comparing the disease in various species and breeds. In Devon cattle, the major clinical deficit is profound blindness at about 14 months of age, with death usually resulting from misadventure by about 2 years. There is severe retinal atrophy but only mild loss of neurons from the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. A single base duplication in the bovine gene CLN5 has been identified. In Tibetan Terriers, blindness is again the dominant sign, but the onset is delayed to middle life and is accompanied terminally by stupor. In the Border Collie and some other dog breeds, there are gait and visual deficits by 18-24 months of age, accompanied by increasing aggression and dementia. Retinal lesions are mild, and blindness is central in origin. Neuronal loss and gliosis are particularly severe in the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer, and significant in the limbic system. In the American Staffordshire Terriers and crossbreds, storage primarily affects Purkinje cells and thalamic nuclei.",

Half of the material stored in lysosomes is the lipidbinding protein subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase. NCL in Merino sheep is also a subunit c-storing disease, clinically and pathologically similar to NCL in South Hampshire sheep. The NCL in both breeds (OCL6 form) apparently results from a mutation at the same gene locus in chromosomal region OAR7q13-15, and both breeds are potential animal models for the human late infantile variant CLN6.

In general, although storage may be widespread in several organs, it is most damaging in neurons of the cerebral cortex, retina, and cerebellar Purkinje system. Thus there is frequently extensive cellular loss and atrophy in these regions, and correlating dementia, blindness, and ataxia. Macroscopically, atrophied areas may have a distinctly brown tinge. Microscopically, the storage granules are brightly autofluorescent under ultraviolet light; pale brown-red or colorless with H&E; weakly acid fast, magenta with PAS; and intensely positive with Luxol fast blue. Ultrastructurally, they appear as membrane-bound cytosomes up to 15 nm in diameter, irregular in outline, and with a variety of forms ( Fig. 4-41 ). Some have membranous material arranged as \"curvilinear bodies\" and \"fingerprint bodies,\" which are considered characteristic. Others may have laminated stacks of membranes akin to zebra bodies, membranous stacks, or dense granular deposits. swainsonine induces a form of \u03b1-mannosidosis that is a close copy of the genetic disease of cattle and cats. Continued ingestion of toxic material over a period of 4-6 weeks and more results in failure to thrive, and, ultimately, ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, and behavioral abnormalities (\"locoism\" in North America, \"pea-struck\" in Australia). Postmortem examination during, or within a short time after, exposure to the plant reveals microscopic and ultrastructural lesions identical to those of genetic \u03b1-mannosidosis. Within 2 weeks of last exposure, much of the storage disease resolves, but axonal spheroids may persist in large numbers in areas such as the cerebellar roof nuclei and caudal brainstem. Swainsonine-induced mannosidosis has been experimentally compared in the cat with genetic mannosidosis, to determine the reversibility of changes such as meganeurite and aberrant synapse formation in higher neurons. Clinical recovery may or may not occur following cessation of exposure, and the persistence of secondary neuronal changes suggests that they, rather than the storage process, may underlie neuronal malfunction. Exposure of young growing animals is more likely to produce irreversible disease than exposure of adults.",

A similar pigment is also present within renal tubular epithelial cells. When storage is intense, the affected gray matter and kidneys may have distinct green discoloration on gross inspection. Histologically, the pigment granules are green-brown and present in a perinuclear distribution in neurons ( Fig. 4-43 ), although some granules may accumulate in dendrites.

If the edema is severe, the astrocyte nucleus is much enlarged, the chromatin is dispersed against the nuclear membrane, and the processes are voluminous. Death of acutely swollen astrocytes may not be accompanied by changes in the adjacent neuropil. Neurons may swell as a brief prelude to lysis. Satellite oligodendroglia are generally spared. However, in cytotoxic edema, oligodendrocytes in white matter degenerate. The nucleus is swollen and less dense than normal; the nucleolus is hypertrophied, and the cytoplasm is enlarged and often visible in routine material.

The basis of vasogenic edema is injury to vascular endothelium of sufficient severity to allow leakage or permeation of plasma constituents, including plasma proteins, if the injury is sufficient. The fluid spreads between cells in response to hydrostatic pressures in the cerebral circulation and those in the tissue. Vasogenic edema is a common complication of traumatic, inflammatory, neoplastic, and hemorrhagic lesions of the nervous system. In cats with renal failure, a hypertensive encephalopathy, characterized by severe brain edema and cerebral arteriolosclerosis, develops as a consequence of prolonged systemic increase of blood pressure. Vasogenic edema is not a conspicuous change in gray matter, because the dense tangle of neuropil resists the passage of fluid. There are exceptions, such as in the periventricular nuclei, where vasogenic edema occurs rather selectively in thiamine deficiency. The structure of white matter offers less resistance to the passage of edema fluid of this origin, and the comparison between the susceptibility of gray and white matter can be seen readily with local lesions near their junction in the cortex. The long fiber tracts, such as the spinal cord, internal capsules, and optic tracts, tend to be spared.

The brainstem is displaced caudally, and this is especially evident in the displacement of the corpora quadrigemina well into the caudal fossa. Perhaps the cord rather selectively. The white matter is supplied by an anastomotic complex in the meninges that produces many small vessels that penetrate directly as end vessels and are susceptible to compression or hypotension.",

The venous sinuses of the dura mater empty into the jugular veins, but they also communicate freely through the bones with extracranial veins. Because of these communications, the effects of obstruction of a dural sinus may be relatively slight, unless there is venous stagnation of the head or venous stagnation within the cranium produced by cerebral swelling or occlusion of more than one major sinus. The venous system of the spinal cord is freely anastomotic and drains partly via the radicular vessels and partly through denticles of ligamentum denticulatum, which is attached to the dura mater, to the paravertebral plexuses. Congestive myelopathy may occur in the cervical spinal cord, and epidural hemorrhage may occur at C6-C7 in horses subject to hyperextension or hyperflexion of the neck. These vessels are also valveless and allow very free communication up and down the spinal canal such that an embolus arising in caudal veins may bypass the caudal vena cava in passing to the lungs. These arrangements of veins may assist in temperature and pressure control in spinal and cerebral vessels. The arrangements have disadvantages. Infiltrating neoplasms may extend from extradural positions to the cord along the venules. Vertebral abscess or osteomyelitis in young pigs, cattle, and sheep may develop at or near T3-T4 in relation to azygos vein entry. In the cranial cavity, infections may extend from the face to the basal meninges. In cattle, sheep, and dogs, pyogranulomatous processes that are occasionally found in the hypothalamic-hypophyseal region are introduced in migrating intravenous foreign bodies that enter the cranial cavity in veins passing through the ophthalmic foramen.",

The major cerebral vessels, derived from the carotid and vertebral arteries, anastomose quite freely in the pia-arachnoid, but once an artery or arteriole penetrates the substance of the brain, it becomes an end artery, although there are some anastomoses at the capillary level. Although these anastomoses can be demonstrated readily, even those of arteriolar size in the meninges are probably of little value. Under normal circumstances, the cerebral arteries have rather set fields of supply. If one vessel is occluded, some collateral circulation develops, but it does not take over more than the periphery of the area of supply of the occluded vessel. In the brain, there may be influences governing collateral circulation in addition to those operating in other tissues, but the basic considerations still apply. The development of collateral circulation will be influenced by the anatomic arrangements of vessels, the volume of ischemic tissue, the rate at which the vascular occlusion develops, the size of the occluded vessel, and, importantly, the quantity of blood flow, which is referable to the state of the systemic circulation, and the quality of blood flow, which is referable to such matters as the oxygen tension and viscosity of plasma. For complete cessation of blood flow in an area of brain, it is probably not necessary that there be complete occlusion of the corresponding artery because flow is expected to cease, especially in peripheral twigs, while the intravascular pressure is still greater than zero. For this reason, ischemic injury in the brain localized to the field of distribution of one or other major cerebral artery may result from occlusion of a carotid vessel. Extracranial anastomoses between the major arterial vessels are, however, effective in the event of vascular occlusion occurring proximal to the circle of Willis.",

There is no specificity in the geographic distribution of purpuric hemorrhages except in infectious canine hepatitis in which intracranial hemorrhage, although not consistently present, has a predilection for the brainstem, thalamus, and caudate nuclei. In focal symmetrical encephalomalacia (see Vol. 2, Alimentary system and peritoneum), the lesions are grossly visible only when hemorrhagic; they are regularly bilateral and symmetrical and have a rather specific pattern in which the internal capsules, dorsolateral thalamus, cerebral aqueduct, and pons may all be involved.

Multifocal hemorrhages in the brain leads to a lacunar infarct. Frequently, the vascular obstruction cannot be demonstrated histologically. At the center of an infarct, there is coagulative and liquefactive necrosis, and around the periphery, there is a zone of minimal ischemic injury with the characters mentioned previously.

Surviving vessels show endothelial and adventitial proliferation, and the astrocytes around the margin of the lesion react. The necrotic tissues are removed from the periphery by liquefaction and microglial phagocytosis, and a cyst remains (see Fig. 4 -55).

Full recovery is expected, and it is assumed that in mild cases there is no morphologic injury. In experimental animals, however, degenerative changes are found in the nuclear masses of the brainstem, and these are probably responsible for the clinical features. Following single injuries, chromatolysis develops in many of the larger neurons of the brainstem, and, in a proportion of affected cells, the degeneration is progressive. With repeated episodes of concussion, affected neurons have a wider distribution that includes the cerebral cortex, and the proportion of cells irreversibly injured is increased. These changes in the brainstem and reticular formation occur if the impact forces are substantial and the brain is subject to rapid acceleration/deceleration; in these cases, direct injury in the hemispheres is to be expected. The mildest degrees of concussion produce no visible structural damage when examined with the light microscope, but there is some experimental evidence that plasma substances, including proteins, may be transported in vesicles through the endothelial cells, and the brain and cord may lose their capacity for autoregulation of blood flow in local areas of static injury.",

The vibrations that travel back and forth in the brain from the point of impact appear not to be important. If the head is firmly immobilized, quite a considerable force may be suddenly applied to it with relatively minor effect, the force of the blow (coup) being absorbed by the skull. Force of much lesser magnitude will cause concussion if the head is capable of moving in response to the blow. The principle to be obtained from these observations is that a degree of acceleration or deceleration is necessary to produce concussion, neural injury being caused by displacement of the cranium relative to its contents. The brain of an adult animal is normally a little smaller than the cranial cavity and, being suspended in the cavity, is capable of slight independent movement. If the head is freely movable and struck a heavy blow, it moves away from the point of impact and collides at the area of impact (coup) with the brain, which is momentarily static. As the brain moves suddenly within the skull toward the point of impact, leptomeningeal blood vessels may be torn as the brain pulls away from the skull (contrecoup), and the contrecoup injury may be greater than the coup injury. In young animals, the brain closely fits the cranial cavity, so relative displacement of the whole brain is expected to be with the white. If the demarcation of gray from white matter is obscured, it can be expected that softening of some degree is present. Cores of softening may be recognizable grossly, and the fact that they are extending up and down the cord from the point of injury is explained as tracking of exudate, especially serum or edema fluid, along the fiber tracts and the path of least resistance. Because the meninges are usually intact, the amount of local swelling is limited.",

The components of the nervous system are vulnerable in a rather fixed order, which is neuron, oligodendroglia, astroglia, microglia, and blood vessels, in that diminishing order of sensitivity. The neurons are not a uniform population, and there are regional differences in their susceptibility to anoxia, those of the cerebral cortex and the Purkinje cells being the most sensitive. Within the cerebral cortex, the neurons of the deeper laminae are more sensitive than those in the superficial laminae. Beneath these levels, there is a gradient of susceptibility through the geniculate bodies, hypothalamus, thalamus, paleocortex, and caudate nucleus. The various patterns of vulnerability are relative; they are established largely by experiments in animals Nitrate/nitrite poisoning Ruminants are also vulnerable to phytogenous nitrates, when intraruminal microbial conversion of nitrates to nitrites exceeds the rate of conversion of the latter to ammonia. The nitrate sources again include many crop plants as well as weeds; plant nitrate concentrations are influenced by soil nitrogen level, and physiologic stresses on the plants, such as water stress and herbicide damage. Occasionally, high nitrate concentration in drinking water is the problem. Absorbed nitrites convert hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which imparts a dark \"chocolate\" color to the blood, and causes dyspnea, cyanosis, weakness, tremors, collapse, and coma.

The reasons for the rapidity of change in immature nervous tissue are not clear, but contributing factors may involve the paucity of myelin that is difficult to remove, the paucity of mature mesenchyme in meninges and about vessels, and the plasticity of vascular arrangements in the developing brain. The rapidity of change in gray matter is generally greater than in the white. Autolytic liquefactive changes depend on continued enzymatic activity that, in turn, depends on availability of oxygen either by diffusion from surrounding tissue or by reflow in the local vessels. Small foci of necrosis are expected to resolve more quickly than large ones. Malacic lesions in the neocortex, where diffusion from collateral vessels is available, are expected to resolve more rapidly than those in the paleocortex, where the vascular supply is more strictly of the end-artery type. Some causes of malacia, such as vascular occlusion, act promptly and the pathologic changes are directly consequential. The cause may act continuously over a period, as in leukoencephalomalacia of horses, and the changes may be incremental.

Softening of gray matter is known as poliomalacia, and softening of white matter is known as leukomalacia; each may be qualified as to the treatment of diabetes. It is also part of the metabolic disturbance of ketosis in cows and pregnancy toxemia in ewes, and arguments have been advanced for regarding the irreversibility of pregnancy toxemia as being the result of hypoglycemic encephalopathy. Piglets in the first week of life readily develop hypoglycemia if there is dietary restriction from any cause. Effective gluconeogenesis does not develop in piglets until about the seventh day of life, and during this first week, their glycemic levels are rather precise reflections of dietary intake. In spite of the severe convulsions and deep coma that occur in hypoglycemia, conspicuous changes do not occur in the brain. It is probable that biochemical disturbances in the neurons precede histologic signs of degeneration by a considerable period. For this reason, acute hypoglycemic death is not expected to produce cerebral lesions. When the period of coma is prolonged, it is probable that all neurons are to some extent altered, but the differentiation of hypoglycemic from autolytic and nonspecific changes can seldom be made with confidence. Although classified with the anoxias, hypoglycemia does not produce the ischemic type of neuronal degeneration characteristic of the usual sorts of anoxia. There is, instead, a tendency for the severe type of neuronal degeneration to occur, characterized by rapid and complete chromatolysis, disappearance of the cytoplasmic margins, and then fading of the cytoplasm, with pyknosis, eccentricity, and fading of the nucleus. Cerebrocortical lesions tend to have a superficial laminar preponderance and generally involve caudate nuclei and putamen, CA1 and CA3-4 regions of the hippocampus, and dentate gyrus, which is usually spared in hypoxicischemic injury.

Necrosis of cerebral cortex is rare in horses, except in the neonatal \"barker syndrome\" (see Fig. 4-49) . In ruminants, poliomalacia is, in the early stages, expected to respond to thiamine, but it also occurs in lead poisoning, water intoxication, and other ill-defined circumstances. Lead also causes poliomalacia in dogs. Convulsive episodes in dogs, some associated with distemper, may leave malacic changes, especially in the parietal and temporal cortex. Metronidazole intoxication of dogs and cats can result in brainstem leukomalacia. In pigs, polioencephalomalacia is usually caused by salt poisoning, but individual cases occur in meningitis or without other association. The isolated case of malacia can be difficult to explain. Idiopathic necrosis and malacia of the hippocampus and piriform lobe in cats is reported from Europe as a cause of seizures. In this condition, known as feline hippocampal necrosis or complex partial cluster seizures with orofacial involvement, lesions are restricted to the hippocampus and in some cases are bilaterally symmetrical.

The distribution of the disease is governed in part by the distribution of annual ryegrasses in winter rainfall areas, although the disease can occur in other areas by the use of transported fodder. Corynetoxin-producing R. toxicus is transported onto the host plants by nematode larvae and then ingested by animals. The nematode A. agrostis emerges from fallen galls following first autumn rains, migrates into the growing points of the ryegrass seedlings, and later penetrates the florets to produce galls. The nematodes are harmless to animals but may carry on the cuticle the bacterium that will proliferate in the gall, forming a yellow slime. The active principle, corynetoxin, is closely related to the tunicamycin antibiotics produced by some strains of Streptomyces. Indeed, tunicamycin-like metabolites have been detected in mycotoxicosis in pigs. Corynetoxins and tunicamycins inhibit lipidlinked N-glycosylation of glycoproteins, which compromises cell membrane integrity. Significant livestock losses in Australia and South Africa result from exposure during summer grazing to parasitized annual ryegrass (L. rigidum), annual beard grass (P. monspeliensis), and blown grass (A. avenacea). In the United States, a similar neurologic syndrome has been described in sheep and cattle fed Festuca nigrescens (chewings fescue) infected with A. agrostis and a Rathayibacter-like organism.",

It has been an important natural disease in foxes and cats and continues to be of some importance in mink. In these carnivorous species, the deficiency is induced by a thiamine-splitting enzyme naturally present in many species of fish. Metabolic analogues of thiamine are known and have been used experimentally to produce the deficiency, but there are no known naturally occurring competitive analogues.

The situation in horses is largely the reverse of that in ruminants because, in horses, lead poisoning is usually chronic. This probably represents, in part, species susceptibility, but is in part because of the manner of exposure in that horses are usually poisoned by prolonged inhalation of fumes from lead smelters or by prolonged ingestion of pastures contaminated by such effluent; such pasture exposure of course also occurs in cattle. Contaminated pastures may contain as much as 100-200 mg Pb/kg foliage.",

The disease in cattle is probably always acute, whereas that in horses is virtually always chronic. The signs are almost exclusively neurologic even though the amount of lead deposited in nervous tissue is relatively small. The usual sources of lead for cattle are paint and metallic lead in storage batteries. Adult cattle are most frequently poisoned at pasture by licking paint or putty cans from rubbish dumps. Calves are usually poisoned when from boredom or allotriophagia they lick painted pens, troughs, and so forth. Metallic lead does not reliably produce poisoning in ruminants under experimental conditions but frequently does so naturally, perhaps because the metal, when well weathered, contains soluble salts on its surface. Lead, chronically ingested, does accumulate in the tissues of ruminants, but it is not a cumulative poison in these species. Under conditions of chronic assimilation in ruminants, large amounts of lead may be stored in tissues, including the brain, without causing lesions or clinical disease.

For example, toxins that interfere with synaptic function can have fatal consequences, yet leave neurons normal in appearance to routine examination. Botulism, tetanus, and strychnine toxicosis are wellknown examples. In the latter 2 conditions, the release of spinal motor neurons from the inhibitory influence of \"Renshaw cells\" (inhibitory neurons) leads to the extensor spasms and hyperesthesia that characterize them. The activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine is blocked-in the case of tetanus by presynaptic blockade of its release and in the case of strychnine by postsynaptic blockade of its receptors. An inborn metabolic equivalent of these poisonings is hereditary myoclonus, in which there is an absence of glycine receptors on spinal motor neurons. The disease may occur in Poll Hereford calves, Peruvian Paso horses, Labrador Retriever dogs, and Merino lambs. In the Hereford disease, the calves are born normally, but suffer severe tetanic spasms on stimulation, are unable to stand, and are nonviable. A distinctive locomotor disturbance in Australian sheep (Coonabarabran staggers, \"cathead\" staggers) has been associated with grazing of the zygophyllaceous plant Tribulus terrestris. The clinical disease is characterized by asymmetrical atrophy of pelvic limb extensor muscles, and irreversible asymmetrical paraparesis or tetraparesis without ataxia. There are no significant structural lesions in the nervous system. Evidence has been presented to suggest that the syndrome is caused by \u03b2-carboline alkaloids acting on dopaminergic upper motor neurons in the nigrostriatum. The long-term nature of the deficits may be the result of the ability of such compounds to form adducts with DNA sequences of genes associated with paralysis, sometimes with clonic convulsions and abdominal pain. In chronic poisoning, usually known as chronic plumbs, the characteristic signs are those of specific nerve pareses affecting chiefly the cranial nerves and expressed particularly as laryngeal and pharyngeal paralysis. The clinical manifestations in dogs are also neurologic, but their pattern is not characteristic. There is anorexia, emaciation, mental irritability, muscular tremors, ataxia, and intermittent convulsions.",

The prominence of capillaries in the gray matter is due largely to congestion, but there may be some endothelial swelling and proliferation to make them more conspicuous. Neuronal changes are equivocal. In some subacute cases in which the course is prolonged for several days, there may be laminar cortical necrosis. The best explanations of laminar necrosis are still based on ischemia-anoxia, implying that lead is not directly neurotoxic in terms of neuronal injury. Indeed, lead tends not to accumulate in nervous tissue. The capillary alterations may therefore be of considerable functional importance and probably precede the swelling of glia. The capillary changes are best seen in thick sections stained by a Nissl stain and in the cerebellum better than in the cerebrum.

The cerebellum may be normal in size and shape or slightly diminished in size and somewhat flattened. Microscopically, there is degeneration and loss of Purkinje cells and transneuronal retrograde degeneration of granule cells (see Fig. 4-27) . The Purkinje cells degenerate, being either shrunken and hyperchromatic or pale, swollen and vacuolated (see Fig. 4-28) ; most disappear, leaving empty baskets and a fenestrated ground layer. In severely affected areas, there is gliosis in the molecular layer and proliferation of Bergmann astrocytes. The atrophic process may show evidence of regional predilection. In Gordon Setters, the dorsal portions of the median lobe and vermis are most severely affected, whereas in Collie dogs, selective involvement of the rostral folia of the vermis is reflected in macroscopic diminution of this area. Collateral changes in the subcerebellar nuclei are minor, but in this regard, it may be pertinent that affected dogs are usually euthanized shortly after the defect becomes apparent. In Scottish Terriers, the degeneration is significantly more pronounced in the dorsal portion of the vermis, and there is a conspicuous accumulation of polyglucosan bodies in the ventral half of the vermis. In some American Staffordshire Terriers and crossbreds, Purkinje cell degeneration is associated with intracytoplasmic accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin.

In the early stages of degeneration, the Purkinje and Golgi cells are shrunken and hyperchromatic or swollen and pale with cytoplasmic vacuolation. They ultimately undergo lysis and disappear, leaving a spongy zone between the granular and molecular layers. There is, simultaneously, a diminution in the population of granule cells. Regressive changes with gliosis may be apparent in the deep cerebellar nuclei and olives. A similar \"daft lamb disease\" has been described in newborn Corriedale and Drysdale lambs. A slowly progressive cerebellar disease, first manifested at 4-7 weeks of age, affects Wiltshire sheep in New Zealand. Cerebellar abiotrophy (Yass ataxia) occurs in fine-wool Australian Merino sheep aged 3-6 years. Lesions are diffuse vacuolation, shrinkage, and loss of Purkinje cells.",

Mutations in human PARK2 cause autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism, which has clinical and pathologic similarities to this canine disease. Clinical signs begin between 9 and 16 weeks of age and are characterized by ataxia and dysmetria. The inherent defect is neuronal degeneration, and the brain changes follow a definite anatomic and temporal pattern of development. Degeneration and loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex is evident at the onset of clinical signs. Subsequently, there is sequential involvement of the olivary nuclei, caudate nuclei and putamen, and finally the substantia nigra. In the cerebellar cortex, chromatolytic degeneration and loss of Purkinje cells is attended by astrocytosis involving Bergmann's glia and depletion of granule cells. In the cerebellar white matter and contained nuclei, there is status spongiosus and axonal swelling. Changes in the olivary nuclei, basal nuclei, and substantia nigra tend to be symmetrical and initially (see Fig. 4 -29) feature neuronal degeneration, axonal swelling, spongiosus and fibrous astrocytosis, with progression to malacia, and cavitation.

Myelin sheaths are thinned around the spheroids, as would be expected, but attenuated sheaths may also occur around axonal segments not obviously swollen. Vacuolation of myelin segments is also a feature. These white matter changes have no obvious tract distribution. In the gray matter, spheroids are found in many nuclei of the caudal brainstem, and to a small extent in the spinal cord. However, from the diencephalon forward, there are virtually no gray matter lesions. Axonal swellings and myelin vacuolation are prominent in the optic nerves in the area of the chiasm.",

Other neurons in the motor hierarchy may be afflicted, including the pyramidal cells of the motor cortex. In some instances, neurons in the brainstem and peripheral ganglia are also involved. In the earlier stages of neuronal degeneration, there may be chromatolytic swelling of the soma, with reduced basophilia, and fading of the nucleus, which tends to remain centrally located. In many of the diseases, the swollen cell bodies are often crowded with abnormally phosphorylated neurofilaments. Eosinophilic inclusions may be present in the cytoplasm, usually representing clustered remnants of normal organelles trapped among arrays of neurofilaments (see Fig. 4-4) . In some cases, these inclusions may be found to have the characteristics of Hirano, Lewy, or Bunina bodies described in human neuropathology. The neuronopathy progresses eventually to neuronal death on a cell-by-cell basis, with individual neurons in different stages of the process at any one time. Ultimately, there may be considerable neuronal loss, with residual gliosis, and Wallerian change in motor nerves and spinal white matter. Neurogenic muscle atrophy is also conspicuous.

This multisystem chromatolytic degeneration clinically resembles globoid cell leukodystrophy, from which it can be differentiated clinically by the exerciseinduced deterioration of neurologic signs in progressive neuronopathy. Animals of both sexes develop hindlimb weakness, ganglia, and autonomic denervation would account for the major functional disturbances. The occasional expression of mild proprioceptive and lower motor neuron deficits may be explained by the lesions in dorsal root ganglia and spinal motor neurons, respectively.",

If several nerves are randomly involved in such a way, the term mononeuropathy multiplex may be applied. Polyneuropathy describes bilaterally symmetrical involvement of several nerves, and carries the implication of a systemic disturbance. From the clinical point of view, most peripheral polyneuropathies occur in association with polyneuritis or demyelination, but in this section, our focus is on noninflammatory axonopathies. Intense Wallerian degeneration of peripheral motor axons will, of course, accompany degeneration of the ventral spinal motor nerve cell bodies, as occurs in the motor neuron diseases previously discussed. Similarly, in the very rare primary sensory polyneuropathies, peripheral sensory fibers will degenerate, but the degeneration will also extend, with the central projections of these cells, into the dorsal funiculi of the spinal cord. In some intoxications-for example, delayed organophosphate-peripheral neuropathy will be accompanied by central axonopathy, as has been illustrated previously.

As would be expected, such diseases are manifested early in life, and a very common and dominant clinical feature is the onset of a severe generalized tremor syndrome. This has led to the use of names A peripheral neuropathy has also been associated with canine hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, and insulinoma.",

Neurologic deficits are related to multiple focal red/brown nodules in the perineurium of nerve trunks, which are organizing hematomas associated with a xanthomatous/granulomatous component. Xanthomatous masses extend between nerve fascicles and appear to compress and distort them, inducing Wallerian degeneration to various degrees of severity. The xanthomas arise from phagocytosis of cholesterol esters by macrophages.

Some axons have a few internodes sheathed, many of which are shorter than would be expected for the axonal caliber, and many of which are single units terminating as \"heminodes.\" Although some immature oligodendrocytes are evident, so too are normally mature ones.

The disease in the Dalmatian is reported in a male pup that developed severe tremors in the neonatal period and was destroyed at 8 weeks of age.

The implication is that sheaths are initially formed, but then deteriorate, leaving their axons intact for a time at least. The use of terminology in this area is of course somewhat arbitrary. For our purposes, primary demyelination is taken to imply the removal from around intact axons of structurally and chemically normal myelin, usually by macrophages and often in an inflammatory setting. The term leukodystrophy is applied to diseases with a heritable basis, early onset in life, lack of inflammation, bilateral symmetry of lesions, selective involvement of white matter areas, and in which some inherent qualitative defect in myelin (dysmyelinogenesis) leads to its dissolution and removal. Myelinolysis refers to the initial disruption of myelin structure by extensive decompaction of lamellae as a prelude to its breakdown and removal, and as such could be involved in many processes. There is room for considerable overlap and liberal interpretation of definitions. The diseases discussed in this section will not include any that could easily be classified as demyelinating, in the sense indicated previously, or as malacic in the sense indicated elsewhere in this chapter, in spite of the propensity for focal softening and even cavitation in some of the leukodystrophies.",

In these white matter tracts, there are multifocal, granular eosinophilic plaques ~30 \u00b5m in diameter (Fig. 4-80) . The plaques are traversed by axons and stain with many, but not all, of the features of normal myelin. There is no sign of myelin degradation or phagocytosis. Immediately around the plaques, there appears to be an increased number of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Some very minor axonal degeneration may be found in some plaques and in normal white matter. It has been concluded that early plaques can be distinguished from old ones. Electron microscopy reveals them to be complex. The ultrastructure suggests great disorder at the myelin paranodes, with relatively normal internodal regions. New plaques reveal axons encompassed, near abnormally long nodes of Ranvier, by hypertrophied oligodendrocyte tongues and processes within a thin myelin sheath. Old plaques contain demyelinated axons (some of which are swollen), surrounded by disorganized myelin lamellae and masses of oligodendrocyte processes. Each plaque may represent the territory of one oligodendrocyte, and reflect its failure to maintain normal paranodal electrolytes, consistent with simple edema, and accounts for the brain swelling that may occur in severe cases. The vacuoles therefore contain no stainable material. A variety of associated functional disturbances has been described but, remarkably, the lesion may have little functional impact, even when quite intense and prolonged. It seems likely that the myelin lesion is one facet of a complex metabolic disturbance, whose ramifications vary according to basic causes. In humans, the classic disease of this type is Canavan disease, with congenital and infantile forms caused by an autosomal recessive trait, and a rare juvenile form with no demonstrable familial association.",

This section will discuss diseases in which the change results from either the swelling of astrocytes or the vacuolation of neurons and neurites. Astrocytic swelling may occur nonspecifically in, or adjacent to, any area of neural tissue acutely injured by trauma, or ischemia, or in which vascular permeability is disturbed. In the absence of such circumstances, its occurrence suggests some direct toxic or metabolic influence upon the astrocytes themselves. It can thus be a feature in hepatic encephalopathy. Spongy vacuolation of neurons and their processes may occur to a limited degree as an incidental change in the red nucleus and nuclei of the caudal brainstem, and also as an artifact of fixation.

Prion diseases (prionoses) are characterized by chronic progressive fatal neurologic manifestations, with both sensory and motor deficits and spongiform encephalopathy, and result from accumulation of an abnormal isoform (PrP Sc , Sc refers to scrapie) of the host prion protein (PrP). The gene (PRNP) encoding the prion protein is highly conserved in animals and humans. Transmissible prion diseases result from infection with an external PrP Sc and accumulation of host-produced PrP Sc , and are called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) to differentiate them from prion diseases originating from genetic mutation, for example, familial Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) in humans. The prion protein is widely distributed in tissues but concentrated in nervous tissue where normal prion protein (PrP c , c is for cellular) is a glycolipid-anchored glycoprotein located on the surface of neuronal plasma membranes; its exact function in mammals is unknown. PrP Sc is not only membrane anchored, but it can also be demonstrated in lysosomes using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. PrP Sc almost never triggers an immune response. Prion diseases in animals include scrapie of sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), chronic wasting disease (CWD) of deer and elk, transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE), and exotic ungulate encephalopathy of captive wild ruminants. Human prion diseases include kuru; CJD, which has 4 types-sporadic CJD, familial CJD, iatrogenic CJD, and variant CJD (vCJD); Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS); and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). The inherited prion diseases of humans are all of dominant inheritance, and all are associated with coding mutations of the PRNP gene. Interest in the TSEs has increased greatly for several reasons. First, the discovery that these diseases may result from an infectious protein agent that is lacking nucleic acids contradicted the central dogma of modern biology that all living organisms use nucleic acids to reproduce. Second, the appearance of BSE in Great Britain and other parts of the world, and its presumed relationship to vCJD, triggered both scientific and public interest in these diseases. Despite extensive work on prions, our understanding of their pathogenesis and etiology is incomplete.",

Lesions are more prevalent in the basal nuclei, thalamus, midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata, and include bilateral symmetrical malacia, status spongiosus, gemistocytic astrocytosis with marked intracytoplasmic vacuolation, gliosis, vascular hyperplasia, and mild infiltration of mixed inflammatory cells, with relative neuronal sparing. Similar but milder lesions occur in the cerebellar ventral vermis and the base of cerebral sulci. Neuronal sparing and marked astrocytic vacuolation suggests a role for astrocytes in the pathogenesis of this condition.

The animals display fear and aggressive behavior, with progressive gait disturbances leading to frequent falling. Eventually, frenzied episodes or recumbency necessitate euthanasia. The origin of the rogue prion is still undetermined; however, ingestion of feed contaminated with infectious prion is the most likely origin for BSE. This contamination may have come from bone and meat meal from scrapie-infected sheep carcasses; however, the BSE agent is different biologically than any of the known scrapie strains. Another source suggested is feed contamination with the remains of humans infected with CJD. Sporadic and genetically determined TSEs have not been detected in cattle. BSE is basically a food-borne epidemic; lateral or vertical transmission is highly unlikely. The pathologic features of BSE resemble those of scrapie. Scrapie-associated fibrils and immunoreactive amyloid are demonstrable. Vacuolation of neuronal cell bodies and processes is particularly prominent in the dorsal vagal, medullary reticular, vestibular, solitary, spinal trigeminal, and red nuclei, and is accompanied by moderate degrees of spongiform change in neuropil. The severity of neuropil and neuronal somatic vacuolation varies independently among anatomic locations, and the latter is sometimes accompanied by ceroid-lipofuscin granules. movement to the CSF. The ability of organisms to breach these barriers determines their neurotropism. Neurotropic viruses and bacteria have developed several strategies to breach or to cross these barriers. For example, several neurotropic viruses bypass the BBB and invade the brain via axons (e.g., rabies virus); intracellular bacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium bovis) invade the brain as Trojan horses, hidden in infected leukocytes; and finally, some bacteria have a direct cytotoxic effect on the endothelial cells of the BBB (e.g., Histophilus somni). The cellular part of the brain's innate immunity is composed of perivascular dendritic cells, microglia, and astrocytes. These cells are rich in pattern recognition receptors, which bind directly and nonspecifically to pathogen-associated molecular patterns. For example, all 3 cell types are rich in macrophage mannose receptor, which is a lectin receptor that recognizes \"nonself\" sugars on the cell wall of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, parasites, and yeasts. Microglia cells also express several tool-like receptors, for example, TLR2 and TLR6, which have a major role as bridges between innate and adaptive immunity. Activated microglia express several receptors important for phagocytosis, for example, CR3 and CR4; recognition of pathogens is followed by phagocytosis, largely by microglial cells and to a lesser extent by astrocytes. Finally, glial cells release several cytokines and antimicrobial peptides, for example, interleukin-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin. Inflammation of the brain starts once an infectious agent overcomes the resident innate immunity and recruiting begins of different components of adaptive immunity (leukocytes and humoral immunity), which are more specific and more effective but also more destructive.",

The endothelial cells of the BBB differ from other body endothelial cells, first by having significantly fewer endocytotic vesicles, thereby limiting the amount of transcellular flux, and second, they are connected by both adherens junction (e.g., cadherin) and tight junction proteins; the latter significantly reduce paracellular flux. Also, BBB endothelial cells are rich in several transport systems that selectively transport essential nutrients to the brain or harmful material back into the blood (efflux transport proteins). One of the most important efflux proteins is P-glycoprotein. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein increases the tissue invasiveness of Listeria monocytogenes.

Vascular responses may be more of an impediment than a help in the reaction to inflammation, because they lead consistently to edema and brain swelling that spreads the consequences of the inflammation far from the active focus. Vascular proliferation and fibrous tissue encapsulation may develop only when the inflammatory reaction involves the meninges and the larger blood vessels because these are the only source of reticulin and collagenous tissue.

Acute demyelinating processes are associated with, and probably stimulate, perivascular cuffing. The cuffs tend to be quite distinct from those in viral infections by being relatively very thick (up to 10 or more cells thick) and to be composed of pure populations of lymphocytes.

Several bacteria, such as streptococci and Escherichia coli, cause bacteremia and suppurative meningitis in neonates, resulting in an important clinical entity, especially in ruminants and pigs, called neonatal bacterial suppurative meningitis (NBSM). Streptococcal NBSM in calves, lambs, and piglets (but not in foals), frequently has a combination of polyarthritis, purulent leptomeningitis, choroiditis, and in calves only, endophthalmitis ( Fig. 4-88A, B) . In pigs, Streptococcus suis types 1 and 2 (see Vol. 1, Bones and joints) cause NBSM that is usually accompanied by polyserositis; S. suis meningitis is suppurative in the acute stage ( Fig. 4-89A, B) , and lymphoplasmacytic in pigs that survive. Streptococcus pneumoniae usually produces fulminating septicemia in calves characterized only by very acute splenitis but, if the course of this infection is less fulminating than usual, polyarthritis and meningitis can be found. E. coli, another cause of NBSM of protracted course, commonly causes well-developed meningitis and polyarthritis in neonatal calves and lambs, but even in fulminating infections, the mild changes of early inflammation can be found in these structures.

In septicemic pasteurellosis of sheep, in infection of foals by Actinobacillus equuli, in infections of sheep and cattle by Histophilus somni, and in some coliform infections of calves, the blood literally swarms with bacteria because common to these infections is massive and widespread bacterial embolism.

Most abscesses develop rather slowly and later become encapsulated. The capsule seems often to be formed more by condensation of vessels around an expanding focus than by proliferating fibroblastic tissue, but both contribute; the result is an irregular capsule thicker on the meningeal than on the ventricular aspect. Most capsules are very distinct and 1-3 mm wide. Their distinctness is the result of the paucity of reticulin or collagen spreading abscesses, but it takes a long time for their fibrils to begin to intertwine with capsular reticulin. The veins are heavily cuffed by lymphocytes. When abscesses are multiple, death is the outcome after a short course. When they are isolated, they may permit prolonged survival. The course is usually short with medullary abscess, even when small, because it, or more usually the edema it provokes, interferes with vital centers. Abscesses in the hypothalamus or cerebrum may track through the white matter to the ventricles to produce pyencephaly that is quickly fatal (Fig. 4-96A-D) .

L. monocytogenes is an intracellular pathogen of macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. Important virulence factors include the surface protein internalin, which internalizes with E-cadherin, an adherens junction protein, to overcome the intestinal, placental, and blood-brain barriers. However, the role of E-cadherin in the intracerebral spread and the distribution of microabscesses is yet to be determined. The organism also relies on another virulence factor, cholesterol-binding hemolysin, to lyse phagocytic cell phagosomes and escape to the cytoplasm. The organism proliferates in the host cell cytoplasm, and many migrate against the cell membrane to form protrusions that can then be taken up by other cells. It is one of the few organisms known to co-opt the host cell contractile actin to facilitate cell-to-cell transfer. Listeriosis behaves as 3 separate diseases or syndromes. They seldom overlap, so that each syndrome probably has a separate pathogenesis. The 3 recognized syndromes are infection of the pregnant uterus with abortion, septicemia with miliary visceral abscesses, and encephalitis. Additional syndromes of clinical significance in ruminants include conjunctivitis, possibly from contaminated silage dust, endocarditis, and mastitis. The uterine infection is discussed with Diseases of the pregnant uterus (see Vol. 3, Female genital system). Aborting ruminants are not usually ill, and abortion is usually late in gestation. The uterine infection is probably hematogenous, and the bacteremic phase is asymptomatic, and localization occurs only in the uterus.

Listerial encephalitis may be sporadic or occur in outbreaks in which the morbidity may be 10% or higher. Outbreaks are usually associated with heavy feeding of silage, with disease most likely occurring in winter and early spring when the animals are indoors. This association of outbreaks of cerebral listeriosis with silage feeding is a circumstantial observation, but the association is so common that silage is fed as a calculated risk and removed from the ration when the first case occurs. The association with silage may indicate an acquired susceptibility of the animals or the provision of a growth medium that leads to heavy infection pressure. The organism will multiply in spoiled silage that is incompletely fermented and with a pH of 5.5 or above. Ingested Listeria is likely to breach the oral mucosal barrier through pathologic or physiologic wounds, for example, erupted teeth wounds. After invading the oral mucosa, the bacteria invade the trigeminal nerves and travel centripetally via axons to the brain. Listeria can also breach the blood-brain barrier under experimental conditions; however, the specific distribution of listerial encephalitis in the natural disease is inconsistent with a hematogenous infection.

The organism has been isolated from diseased mammals and birds of many species and produces septicemia, not highly toxigenic because the parenchyma surrounding the glial nodules and focal abscesses may be little changed. Commonly however, the white matter is edematous and rarefied. Such areas may be large and lightly, but diffusely, infiltrated by neutrophils and hypertrophied microglia.

Calves are infected by carrier cows in the first months of life, and they in turn disseminate the infection in feedlots. The mechanism, site, and circumstance by which the bacteria invade the bloodstream are not known, but it is possible that organisms in genital discharges or aerosolized urine invade via the respiratory tract. Infection, especially the respiratory form, is usually preceded by stress factors such as transportation. These bacteria have virulent and avirulent strains. Important virulence factors include lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS), immunoglobulin Fc binding proteins, inhibition of oxygen radicals, and intracellular survival. The mechanism of vasculitis in H. somni infection is complex, but it can be partially explained by the effect of LOS on endothelial cells. LOS triggers apoptosis of bovine endothelial cells in vitro by caspase-3 activation. This effect is associated with the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. Another proposed mechanism for the vascular damage induced by H. somni is the activation of platelets by the bacteria and its LOS. Platelets activated by H. somni initiate endothelial apoptosis via caspases 8 and 9, induce endothelial cell cytokine production and adhesion molecule expression, and promote endothelial cell production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further enhances apoptosis. Cerebral blood vessels are particularly vulnerable to damage by the organism, but vasculitis can develop in most organs.",

Astrocytes degenerate or react depending on how strictly and severely they are injured; the stimuli for astrocytic reaction were discussed previously in this chapter. The gliosis that is so frequently a feature of nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis is almost solely microglial. The gliosis may be diffuse or focal but is commonly both (see Fig. 4-15 ). Diffuse gliosis may be more apparent than real if resulting more from hypertrophy than from proliferation of these glia. Focal gliosis may occur anywhere in the parenchyma and may be related to small vessels and injury to microvasculature. When there are more than a dozen or so cells in such foci, some of the cells are likely to be lymphocytes, and occasionally there are a few plasma cells. The microglia in the center of a focus are frequently degenerate. There are 2 specifically named forms of microgliosis. \"Neuronophagic nodules\" are foci of microglia about degenerating neurons (see Fig. 4-2D) ; \"glial shrubbery\" is an accumulation of these cells in the molecular layer of the cerebellum in relation to degenerating Purkinje cells (Fig. 4-101) .",

The RABV glycoprotein (RVG), which is a trimeric and surface-exposed viral coat protein, is responsible for RABV neurotropism by binding to several neural tissue receptors, including the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Evolutionary studies based on genes encoding the surface glycoprotein suggest that RABV evolved first in bats, possibly in vampire bats much more widely distributed than at present, and only later became adapted to terrestrial carnivores. There is a single major antigenic type with minor variations that allow epidemiologic surveillance. The genus Lyssavirus has 7 genotypes that are defined by phylogenetic analysis. Type 1 is the classic rabies virus of animals and vampire bats, and of all other bat lyssaviruses in North America. Type 2 (Lagos bat virus), type 3 (Mokola virus), and type 4 (Duvenhage virus) are African genotypes. Types 5 (EBLV-1) and 6 (EBLV-2) are European bat lyssavirus 1 and 2, respectively, and type 7 (Ballina virus) is the Australian bat lyssavirus. The 7 genotypes may further be allocated into 2 major phylogroups based on pathogenicity for mice and crossneutralization. Phylogroup 1 includes genotypes 1, 4-7, and phylogroup 2 includes genotypes 2 and 3. Excepting Mokola virus, bats may be the preferential vector species for genotypes 2-7.

This is typical of the axonal reaction to injury, but the axons are intact. Many neurons appear as if coagulated, being shrunken, rounded, isolated, and staining darkly with eosin.

If there is ganglioneuritis, it may be part of rabies or something else. Pigs, for example, get ganglioneuritis in the Teschen group The pathogenesis of the infection following local inoculation is well established for the rabbit and is probably comparable in other species. The virus causes a local reaction at the site of inoculation if percutaneous and then spreads centripetally along the related nerve to the spinal cord; it then spreads outward again along other peripheral nerves as other segments of cord are progressively invaded by spread within the CNS. Because of the progressive advance of infection along the cord, death may occur before demonstrable amounts of virus reach the brain and before lesions have time to develop there. Intracerebral inoculation produces encephalitis, and virus spreads to the cord and centrifugally along peripheral nerves to an extent that depends on survival time. Because the virus also circulates in the blood, there is some possibility but no evidence that it invades the brain directly, the evidence instead suggesting that it localizes in viscera and invades the nervous system along autonomic nerves. Following nasal or intraocular exposure, the virus spreads along the related nerves. The route of invasion following ingestion is by retrograde transneuronal infection. Transplacental infections occur in pigs causing abortion in about 50% of sows pregnant in the first month, and the delivery of macerated, mummified, and normal fetuses when infection occurs at later stages of gestation. The virus is reported to be present in the semen of carrier boars.",

Very young sucklings do not show specific nervous signs but rapidly become prostrate and die in 12-24 hours. In slightly older piglets, incoordination progresses rapidly to paralysis with muscular twitchings, tremors, and convulsions. Some pigs showing severe signs of encephalitis recover. Experimental peripheral inoculation will produce asymptomatic meningitis and encephalitis in swine, the inflammatory lesions being severe. The disease in older pigs is often characterized by fever, rhinitis, and coughing.

A number of strains have been identified that exhibit a wide range of virulence. Pseudorabies virus is capable, as are other members of the family Herpesviridae, of establishing latent infection. Trigeminal ganglion, olfactory bulb, and tonsil are the most consistent sites of latency of PRV. In these organs, viral DNA can be detected in the absence of infectious virus. The pig is the only natural host, but the common domestic species are naturally susceptible; there are very few reports in horses and goats. Progressive infections do not occur in humans. The disease is reported worldwide, except for Canada and Australia. Natural infections occur in rats and mice and various species of wildlife and on fur farms. Of the laboratory animals, the rabbit is the most susceptible and is preferred for identification of the virus because of the fairly consistent development of intense local pruritus following subcutaneous inoculation. Guinea pigs are less susceptible and may resist subcutaneous inoculation but succumb to intracerebral and, occasionally, to intraperitoneal inoculation.",

Transmission can occur by ingestion, but the usual method of spread between pigs is thought to be by contact of infective secretions with nasal mucosa or abraded skin. Animals are susceptible to intranasal inoculation, and regardless of the route of infection, the virus can be found in nasal secretions. The virus may also be present in saliva and urine. It is also present in blood, but this is of no significance for epidemiology or transmission. The infection will occur in pigs by contact very readily and probably by direct nose-to-nose transmission, but it does not appear to be contagious between individuals of other species, and they probably acquire their infection by contact with swine or, possibly, rats. Pigs may harbor virus for many months in tonsils and nasopharyngeal secretions after exposure, but in other domestic species, the virus is fairly strictly neurotropic, and therefore is not excreted unless given experimentally in large doses. Ingestion of infected pig meat is the usual source of infection for dogs and cats. Cattle and sheep may become infected by direct contact with carrier swine or by aerosol exposure, but there is strong circumstantial evidence implicating contaminated feed. changes are nonsuppurative. In addition, focal gliosis and lesions typical of neuronal degeneration (neuronophagia and satellitosis) are usually present (Fig. 4-104A, B) . There is severe ganglioneuritis in paravertebral ganglia. The specificity of the reaction in the brain depends on the development of acidophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in neurons and astroglia ( Fig. 4-104C) . These inclusion bodies occur in all species, including pigs; fixation in a mercurial fixative is helpful for their demonstration. Inclusions in swine are solid and amphophilic, but in other species, the inclusions are granular and often small and multiple in an affected nucleus. By any route of infection, piglets tend to develop panencephalitis with most severe lesions in the cerebral cortex, brainstem, spinal ganglia, and basal ganglia of the brain (see Fig. 4-104B) ; in other domestic species, the distribution of lesions in the CNS is local to, and determined by, the route of exposure.

In 1999 it was introduced into New York City, where it caused a massive outbreak in animals and humans. During the period 1999-2004, the virus spread rapidly to most of the United States and southern parts of Canada. It has been suggested that the virus was imported from the Middle East, given the genetic similarity between strains isolated in the Scotland, and Northern Ireland for more than a century and has been reported in Norway. The disease is named after the leaping (or louping) demonstrated by the diseased sheep. A similar disease has been reported in Spain, Greece, and Turkey, affecting sheep or goats, but because the etiologic viruses are different by nucleotide sequencing from LIV, each was considered a subtype of LIV but assigned different names: Spanish sheep encephalomyelitis virus and Greek goat encephalomyelitis virus. Cattle, horses, goats, and deer pastured with affected sheep sometimes contract the disease, and nonfatal human infections are known. The virus causes fatal encephalomyelitis in red grouse (Lagopus scoticus). Outbreaks in piglets have followed the feeding of raw meat from lambs, and a case has been described in a dog.",

I. ricinus is parasitic on a variety of mammals in addition to sheep and on birds; however, the most significant wildlife host is the red grouse. Larval and nymphal ticks acquire the virus when feeding on infected sheep, and transmit the infection to new hosts in the succeeding nymphal and adult phases. Because of its natural mode of transmission, louping ill is most prevalent in early summer and early autumn when the ticks are active. After infection, the virus propagates in regional lymph nodes, proceeds to viremia, and then enters the CNS via the hematogenous route. Alternatively, the virus may localize indirectly from the blood in nasal structures and enter the brain via the olfactory nerves. Under experimental conditions, a number of factors may facilitate entry of virus into the brain, and facilitation is apparently given in natural cases by concurrent tickborne fever, a rickettsiosis also transmitted by I. ricinus, and known to impair humoral and cellular defense mechanisms.",

The inflammatory lesions are more obvious than in most viral encephalitides, but are of the usual type, although unusually large numbers of neutrophils may be present in very severe cases, and largely restricted to gray matter, although cuffing and focal gliosis occur in the white matter.

The virus is now distributed throughout the world, and fulminant disease is reported in humans, horses, and birds from all continents. The virus is divided genetically into 2 lineages: lineage 1 WNV is present in North America and some other parts of the world; lineage 2 is restricted to enzootic areas in Africa. Lineage 2 WNV strains are either nonpathogenic or occasionally cause mild human and equine disease. Some clades in lineage 1 (e.g., clade 1a) are highly virulent and are believed to be responsible for the recent outbreaks in North America. The virus has a wide host range, but is maintained in the environment mainly by a bird-mosquito-bird cycle. Wild birds, especially corvids, that is, crows, are the main amplifying hosts. Wild birds usually develop prolonged viremia, and the virus is distributed in almost every organ. In contrast, the viral antigen in infected horses, which is by far the most susceptible species of domestic animal, is sparse and limited to the CNS. Infection between birds or between birds and mammals or reptiles is mainly via mosquitoes. Mosquitoes of the Culex spp. are the main maintenance vectors. The virus is also found in other vectors, such as ticks, but the biological importance of these vectors is yet to be determined.

The PCV-2 antigen has been identified in brain in these cases, demonstrating neurotropism of the virus under experimental conditions. The role of PCV-2 in encephalitis associated with natural infection is controversial. PCV-2 antigen has been detected in brains of pigs with naturally occurring encephalitis but always in association with other pathogens that can cause encephalitis alone and under natural conditions (e.g., porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus or Streptococcus suis). Also, the PCV-2 antigen was demonstrated in neonatal pigs in association with naturally occurring congenital tremor type A2 (see Porcine hypomyelinogenesis); however, the exact role of PCV-2 in this condition is yet to be determined. Bovine meningoencephalomyelitis caused by Bovine herpesvirus 1. Nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis caused by species Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus) is reported worldwide. BoHV-1 causes multiple and diverse conditions in cattle, such as abortion, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, infectious bovine vulvovaginitis, and balanoposthitis. Some BoHV-1 serotypes are neurovirulent and are able to induce encephalitis. Marked upper respiratory disease typically precedes or occurs concurrently with the encephalitis. The pathogenesis and clinical signs are similar to those described for BoHV-5. Histologic lesions are those of nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis with occasional intranuclear herpetic inclusions. The massive neuronal necrosis and gliosis described in BoHV-5 are not usually seen in association with BoHV-1. BoHV-1 encephalitis is more prevalent in calves; however, sporadic cases can affect adult cattle, particularly in the Near and Middle East.",

Both viruses are widespread in horses, have significant economic impact on the equine industry, and are responsible for several clinical conditions, including respiratory disease, pulmonary vasculotropic disease, enteric disease, abortion, and neurologic disease, known as equine herpesviral myeloencephalopathy (EHM). EHM is an important neurologic disease characterized clinically by ataxia, paresis, and paralysis, and caused mainly by EHV-1 and incidentally by EHV-4. Almost all recent outbreaks have been associated with EHV-1 infection. Increased numbers of EHM-outbreaks have been attributed to strains of the virus that are neurovirulent or neuropathogenic. The neuropathogenic strains have a single point mutation in the polymerase-coding gene of EHV-1. This mutation is commonly known as the neuropathogenic versus non-neuropathogenic mutation. This mutation results in variation of a single amino acid of the DNA polymerase, such that \"non-neuropathogenic\" strains have asparagine (N752) and neuropathogenic strains have aspartic acid (D752). Other members of equine alphaherpesviruses that are pathogenic but do not cause neurologic disease include Equid herpesvirus 3 (equine coital exanthema virus) and Equid herpesvirus 8 (Asinine herpesvirus 8), which induces interstitial pneumonia in donkeys. Equid herpesvirus 9 (Gazelle herpesvirus) causes severe encephalitis experimentally in several species of domestic animals; the natural outbreak of fulminant encephalitis has been reported in a herd of Thomson's gazelles that were in close association with zebras.

EHV-1 replicates first in upper respiratory tract epithelium and local lymph nodes, and then induces T-cell and monocyte-associated viremia that ends with invasion of endothelial cells of the CNS and pregnant uterus. This leukocyte-associated viremia protects the virus from humoral immunity. The virus is endotheliotropic, epitheliotropic, and neurotropic, but not neurovirulent. The replication of virus in endothelial cells of the CNS leads to initiation of the inflammatory cascade that ends in thrombo-occlusive necrotizing vasculitis. The resultant myeloencephalopathy is the result of destruction of CNS tissue secondary to vasculitis. The vasculitis is either caused by direct viral cytotoxic effect or by an immune-mediated (Arthus-type reaction) mechanism. A similar mechanism is responsible for EHV-1-induced abortion and pulmonary vasculotropic disease.

It is widely distributed in the warm Pacific regions, but its distribution is much more limited than that of the gastropod intermediate hosts and the rat. The parasite resides in the pulmonary arteries of rats; eggs lodge as emboli in alveolar capillaries and the larvae, which hatch in about 6 days, and follow the tracheal-intestinal route to the exterior. First-stage larvae actively penetrate terrestrial and aquatic slugs and snails, which act as intermediate hosts. Transport hosts for third-stage larvae include frogs, crabs, and prawns. In addition to the rat, dogs, humans, and occasionally other species are infected by eating intermediate or transport hosts and, possibly, directly by ingestion of infective larvae that have emerged from intermediate hosts. Ingested larvae enter and are dispersed by the circulation to many tissues, but predominantly to brain, kidney, and muscle. Molting larvae in the brain produce a mild to severe inflammatory reaction before re-entering the venous circulation for return to the pulmonary arteries. Aberrant infections are important in humans and dogs, and are reported in horses and macropods. The human disease, eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, is usually mild and without sequelae, but infection in dogs can be accompanied by ascending paralysis. Larvae that enter the brain in dogs are probably inhibited in their development and destroyed there (Fig. 4-119) . The lesions are granulomatous, randomly distributed in the cord and brain and are most frequent and severe in the cord. Rarely, degenerate parasites are present in the granulomas, but apparently viable worms in the tissue are not accompanied by an inflammatory reaction. Eosinophils infiltrate the granulomas but are more numerous in affected meninges. The extraneural pathology of toxoplasmosis is discussed elsewhere in these volumes. The nervous system lesions, including polyradiculoneuritis, are identical to those described for neosporosis; however, the tissue cyst has a thinner wall (<0.5 \u00b5m), is 5-70 \u00b5m in size, and contains several bradyzoites 0.7-1.5 \u00b5m. Tachyzoites are 2-6 \u00b5m in size. The encephalitic form of toxoplasmosis is most likely to occur in immunosuppressed dog and cats or kittens.

This is most consistently peritonitis, and in ~50% of fatal cases, there is also pleuritis and pericarditis. The meninges appear congested and edematous and occasionally are covered with a few fibrin tags. Microscopically, there is a rather severe and diffuse meningoencephalomyelitis. The leptomeningitis is most severe about the base of the brain. The reactive cells are almost solely histiocytes and plasma cells, with only a few neutrophils. These cells infiltrate the meninges and perivascular spaces and mix with reactive adventitial cells of the vessel walls. The vascular endothelium proliferates secondary to lesions in the vascular walls, and ischemic changes may occur in the parenchyma. Reactive microglial nodules are widespread in the brain.",

A similar condition, but with lesions more prevalent in the white matter, is reported in the Boston Terrier, Chihuahua, and Yorkshire Terrier (distinct from Yorkshire Terrier necrotizing encephalopathy, which affects brainstem), named necrotizing leukoencephalitis (NLE). The cause of NME and NLE is unknown; several etiologic agents have been suggested as causes, including alphaherpesvirus, but none has been confirmed. An autoimmune reaction against canine brain tissue has been suggested as a possible mechanism. A wide age range is affected. Generalized convulsions and their aftermath dominate the clinical picture, which may include lethargy, ataxia, and progression to coma. The clinical signs refer essentially to cortical disease that progresses rapidly over a few weeks, but which may extend to several months. The lesions are particularly in the cerebral cortex, and are bilateral but asymmetrical, often confluent over large areas, and extend to the adjacent white matter with relative sparing of the deeper periventricular tissue. The geography of the lesions therefore helps to distinguish this disease from other encephalitides of the dog. Grossly, localized swellings in the cerebrum contribute to asymmetry, and malacic foci may be seen as typical yellow areas of softening ( Fig. 4-122) or, in cases of longer duration, as tiny cystic cavities.",

Numerous foci of meningitis, characterized by infiltrations of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and is cuffing of vessels by lymphocytes and plasma cells with small eccentric clumps of macrophages. The macrophages increase in number and may come to comprise the cuff, appearing as discrete granulomas, which, depending on the plane of section, may appear to be in the parenchyma. Occasional mitoses are present in these cells. Transformation to epithelioid cells occurs later. The perivascular aggregates expand in concentric arrangements and displace surrounding parenchyma ( Fig. 4-126) . Where the cuffing response is severe, edema and necrosis may occur in the adjacent white matter, leading to a spillover of mononuclear cells into the parenchyma and to the usual reactive changes. Large malacic foci are unusual. In cases of prolonged duration, confluence of lesions occurs and reparative responses include the deposition of abundant reticulin and collagen in perivascular arrangements. Involvement of meninges is patchy and often related to lesions of white matter directly underlying. Cytologic characterization of the cell aggregates can be difficult. In many, and perhaps most, cases, the cells are easy to classify, being well differentiated as lymphocytes, monocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes ( Fig. 4-127A, B) . Granulocytes may be present but are not numerous, and histiocytes horses, and has many similarities to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) in humans. The condition was named coonhound paralysis to reflect the fact that some affected dogs had been bitten or scratched by raccoons, although cases may have no known exposure to raccoons. Within 7-10 days, ascending flaccid paralysis, starting in the hindlimbs and progressing cranially to involve the forelimbs, leads to quadriplegia and rapid atrophy of muscle. There are no cerebral signs. Some dogs die of respiratory paralysis, but most will recover slowly if nursing is adequate. Dogs that have recovered appear to have increased sensitivity to subsequent exposure but may survive several bouts of paralysis. The disease has been transmitted using pooled saliva of raccoons, but the cause has not been identified; an autoimmune mechanism and microbial triggers, such as Toxoplasma, have been suspected. Similar to GBS in humans, anti-GM 2 ganglioside antibodies have been found in ACP dogs.",

Choroid plexus tumors express epithelial markers, for example, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, and focally GFAP. sion. The tumor likely originates from the renal primordium, a renal ectopic embryonic remnant from which diverse nephron cell types are derived, present at this area. For this reason, this tumor can be regarded as a non-neuroepithelial ectopic embryonal tumor. The histologic appearance is of glandular areas intermingling with cellular areas. The glandular areas consist of rosettes and tubules, the latter tortuous, branching, and sometimes papilliferous, with infoldings reminiscent of embryonic glomerular capsules (Fig. 4-139) . The cellular areas contain densely packed cells of blastema appearance with ovoid clear nuclei and indistinct cytoplasm. Some streaming is evident, but muscle fibers are not present. In some of these tumors, glomerular structures can be recognized with confidence as can tubular cross-sections strongly suggestive of distal renal tubules. Presumably, these tumors arise from ectopic embryonic remnants, but notably the kidneys do not contain neoplasm, although nephroblastomas are well recognized in dogs. From time to time, undifferentiated tumors of embryonic type and possibly derived from remnants of pronephros are seen in the cervical region of dogs and sheep.",

However, EPM-like disease can occur in other S. neurona intermediate hosts, including the cat and dog, and this disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory encephalomyelitis in this species. Both N. hughesi and N. caninum can cause identical EPM lesions in horses. The complete life cycle and methods of transmission for N. hughesi have not been determined. N. hughesi tachyzoites are crescent shaped, approximately 5 \u00d7 2 \u00b5m. Definitive diagnosis of EPM in a live horse is challenging. Detection of S. neurona or N. hughesi antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid by an immunoblot test is available. Positive results indicate exposure, but do not necessarily indicate that the horse has EPM. The postmortem diagnosis depends on finding characteristic lesions, especially in the presence of the characteristic protozoal stages. Immunohistochemistry kits for S. neurona and N. caninum are available commercially. Neosporosis. Neospora caninum is an apicomplexan coccidian parasite that is a major pathogen of cattle, in which it causes abortion, and for dogs. Other species, such as goats, sheep, deer, and horses, can be infected occasionally. Dogs are the primary definitive host, and they are also considered as an intermediate host. Other canids, for example, coyotes (Canis latrans), may also be important definitive hosts. N. caninum has 3 infectious stages: tachyzoites, tissue cysts, and oocysts. Tachyzoites and tissue cysts are found both in intermediate hosts and the definitive host. However, oocysts are only present in the definitive host. Tachyzoites have been found in neurons; reticuloendothelial cells; hepatocytes; muscle cells, including myocardium; and bovine placenta. Tissue cysts have been found in the CNS, muscles, and retina. The exact modes of transmission are not well understood. Dogs become infected by ingesting tissues contaminated with tissue cysts, and then shed oocysts in their feces. Cattle and other intermediate hosts become infected by ingesting sporulated oocyst-contaminated food, water, or soil. However, the principal route for infection in cattle is transplacental (vertical) transmission. N. caninum does not cause significant clinical disease in adult cattle; however, it causes abortion in both dairy and beef",

GME appears to have a worldwide distribution and to occur mostly in young to middleaged dogs of small breeds, for example, terriers and toy breeds; however, the disease can occur in any breed and in an age range of 6 months to 12 years. The cause of GME is unknown; several infectious causes have been suggested but not confirmed to be the cause of this condition. Based on the predominance of CD3+ T cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen-positive macrophages, an immune-mediated mechanism has been proposed.Variations in the distribution and extent of the lesions result in a variety of clinical signs. Spinal lesions may be associated with ataxia, paresis, or paralysis. Lesions in the brainstem frequently produce signs of vestibular dysfunction. Changes of behavior, forced movement and circling, depression, and convulsions occur with supratentorial lesions. Macroscopic lesions, if evident, consist of gray-white discoloration of the white matter of the brain or spinal cord (Fig. 4-124) , and in those cases in which the cellular aggregations become confluent, there may be irregular areas of malacia (Fig. 4-125) .The histologic changes are patchy in distribution. There may be very few foci, or they may be disseminated, or they may be localized to one area and confluent, or there may, in the same animal, be both confluent and disseminated distributions. The essential histologic feature is perivascular aggregation of cells rather selectively in the white matter. The minimal lesion Further reading Higgins RJ, et al. Necrotizing ",
