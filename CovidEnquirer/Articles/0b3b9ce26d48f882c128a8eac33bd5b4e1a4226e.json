When the continuous collection and analysis of surveillance data raises suspicion of an outbreak or a single case of a dangerous disease, biosurveillance personnel must decide whether to react to the information.

They may decide to take actions such as the issuance of a boil-water advisory (in the case of suspected water contamination), closure of a restaurant, or treatment of individuals with antibiotics or vaccines. Whenever the staff (or an automatic system) decides to collect additional data, the biosurveillance process exhibits a feedback loop. If the event is confirmed, staff will make many decisions over time about additional data to collect, directed by the analysis of data accumulated to that point (a positive feedback loop).",

The terms disease surveillance and public health surveillance connote disease surveillance practiced by governmental public health. Biosurveillance allows us to broaden the scope of our discussion to include many other organizations that monitor for disease, such as hospitals, agribusinesses, and zoos. These organizations share the same basic goals of identifying individuals (people or animals) with disease, understanding disease transmission patterns in a population, elucidating the root causes of disease outbreaks, and monitoring the microbiological status of the environment. They collect similar types of data (clinical, microbiological, and environmental), use similar techniques to analyze the data, and they all face difficult decisions regarding how to react to the data. They often interact with each other to achieve the goals of disease detection and characterization. The similarities in goals and techniques suggested that we should unify them conceptually.",

To keep what was already a very large topic manageable, we decided against discussing surveillance for these conditions. The principles and techniques that we discuss, nevertheless, apply to surveillance for any disease or condition. Importantly, we decided against disease surveillance and public health surveillance because we consider outbreak characterization (i.e., determining the organism, source, route of transmission, spatial distribution, and number of affected individuals) a key process in biosurveillance. Epidemiologists may not consider outbreak characterization as falling under disease surveillance or public health surveillance (e.g., Buehler, 1998: Chapter 22; Teutsch and Churchill, 2000) .
