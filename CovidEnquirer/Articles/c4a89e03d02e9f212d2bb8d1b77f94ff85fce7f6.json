It is now believed that the sharp increase and decrease in the number of patients was caused by the existence of superspreaders. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the USA, the patients are defined as superspreaders if they infect more than 10 people [2] . Superspreaders thus have a strong effect on other people and cause wide spread of the disease. Although superspreaders are believed to play important roles in the outbreak of SARS, the biological characterization of the superspreaders have not been performed.",

By Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the spread of disease as a function of population and the density of superspreaders. In Section 2, we explain our model in detail. In Section 3, results of Monte Carlo simulation are presented about the percolation probability of disease, the velocity of disease propagation, the epidemic curve and secondary infections.

We introduced two models for superspreaders who have two kinds of distance dependence of infection probability. From Monte Carlo simulation, we have obtained the percolation probability as functions of the density rpr 2 0 for different fraction of superspreaders l. If rpr 2 0 is sufficiently low, the percolation probability is zero and the percolation transition appears at the critical density r c pr 2 0 . We showed the critical density r c pr 2 0 decreases as l increases, and r c pr 2 0 coincides with the density at the critical basic reproductive number R 0 \u00bc R c . We could see the critical density of the strong infectiousness model is larger than the hub model, and in the hub model infection propagates faster than in the strong infectiousness model for any l40. Moreover, the epidemic curves were shown that the number of infected increases rapidly with a sharp maximum if superspreaders are mixed in the system. With mixing the superspreaders, the distribution of the number of links of the infection route network have long tail and get enhanced at zero in comparison with no superspreaders. Our results were compared with the data of SARS outbreak in 2003. The feature of distribution of the number of secondary patients is similar with the distributions from our models. This result suggests that our models can be applied to simulate SARS. Moreover, from the comparison of the epidemic curve of SARS with our models, the hub model reproduces the epidemic curve similar to the data of SARS. From this result, we conclude that the social connections are important for the spreading of disease, and the superspreader has many social connections.",
