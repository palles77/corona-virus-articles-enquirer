Roem resulted in the isolation of ten new limonoids, toonasinenines A-J (1-10), together with two known compounds, toonafolin (11) and toonacilianin D (12). Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analyses. The isolated components were evaluated in vitro for radical scavenging potential using ABTS \u00b7+ and DPPH test, anti-inflammatory activities for Cox-1 and Cox-2, and cytotoxicies against nine tumour cell lines (A549, BGC-823, CHG-5, HCT15, HeLa, HepG2, MDA-MB-231, SHG-44 and SGC-7901 cells). As a result, 4, 5 and 7-10 showed potent radical scavenging activities, while limonoids 1-4 and 11 exhibited significant antiinflammatory and cytotoxic potential.",

            "text": "Toona sinensis (A. Juss.) Roem (Meliaceae), a perennial deciduous arbour, is widely distributed in eastern Asia (Edmonds & Staniforth, 1998) . The leaves of T. sinensis, which contain a distinct flavour, are very popular in vegetarian cuisine and have long been used as a nutritious food in China and Malaysia and as animal fodder in India (Chen, Liang, Huang, & Huang, 2015) . Almost every part of T. sinensis, including seeds, bark, root bark, petioles, and especially leaves, has a medicinal effect (Chang et al., 2006) . The bark is used as astringent and depurative substance, the powdered root is used as a corrective, and the fruits are applied for the treatment of eye infection and used as an astringent. Leaves possess anti-inflammatory, antidoting, and worm-killing effects and are used in folk medicine to treat enteritis, dysentery, carbuncles, boils, dermatitis, scabies, tinea blanca, and especially abdominal tumours (Hsiang et al., 2013; Malairajan, Gopalakrishnan, Narasimhan, Veni, & Kavimani, 2007) . Previous pharmacological and bioactivity studies on the extract of T. sinensis leaves have revealed anti-cancer (Chen, Chien, Huang, & Chia, 2014) , anti-sepsis (Yang, Chen, Tsai, Huang, & Wang, 2014) , antimicrobial (Wu et al., 2014) , antinociceptive (Su et al., 2015) , anti-inflammation (Hseu et al., 2011) , anti-diabetes (Hsieh et al., 2012) , antioxidant (Chen, Huang, Lin, Hsu, & Chung, 2013) , and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities (Zhao, Zhou, Chen, & Wang, 2009) . T. sinensis leaf extract inhibits microglia-mediated neuroinflammation (Wang, Tsai, Hsieh, Lin, & Lin, 2014) , Leydig cell steroidogenesis (Poon, Leu, Hsu, Liu, & Huang, 2005) and severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) coronavirus replication (Chen et al., 2008) . It also inhibits lipid accumulation and fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes (Liu, Tsai, & Chang, 2014) . The safety profile and nonmutagenic characteristics of the extracts from T. sinensis have been evaluated using acute and sub-acute toxicity studies in mice and rat (Liao, Yeh, Lin, Wei, & Chung, 2009 ). Because of the pharmacological properties of T. sinensis leaves, the study of the chemical composition has been of particular interest. Currently, phytochemical studies have shown the presence of limonoids, flavonoids, phytols, coumarins and norcysteine derivative (Cheng et al., 2009) . However, these studies mainly focus on the high polar extracts and volatile compounds. To find more pharmacologically and structurally interesting substances, the present investigation led to ten new limonoids, toonasinenines A-J (1-10), and 2 known compounds, toonafolin (11) and toonacilianin D (12) (Fig. 1) . The structures of these com-pounds were elucidated mainly by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic and mass spectroscopic (MS) methods. Furthermore, all the limonoids were evaluated in vitro for their radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic potential.",

The capability to scavenge the ABTS \u00b7+ was calculated with the following equation: ABTS \u00b7+ scavenging effect (%) = 100 \u2212 [(ASample/AControl) \u00d7 100], where ASample is absorbance of the remaining concentration of ABTS \u00b7+ in the presence of different compounds and AControl is the initial concentration of the ABTS \u00b7+ .

Analyses of its 13 C NMR spectrum displayed 29 carbon resonances due to six methyl (one oxygenated), five sp3 methylene (one oxygenated), nine methine (three oxygenated and three olefinic), seven quaternary (one ketone and one olefinic), and two ester carbonyl carbons. These functionalities (two double bonds and three cabonyl) accounted for 5 out of the 11 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining 6 degrees of unsaturation required 1 to be hexacyclic. Strong HMBC correlations of H-12 (\u03b4H 2.44 and 1.62), H-16 (\u03b4H 2.28 and 1.81), H-17 (\u03b4H 2.76), and H-30 (\u03b4H 1.25) with C-14 (\u03b4C 74.3) and H-17 with C-15 (\u03b4C 54.9) and C-21 (\u03b4C 139.3) clearly indicated the five-membered ring D to have a 14,15-epoxy group. A ketone carbon resonance (\u03b4C 208.8) was assigned to C-3 as judged from the HMBC correlations of Me-28/C-3 and Me-29/ C-3. The oxygen bridge could then be located between C-1 and C-11 due to the HMBC correlation of H-1 (\u03b4H 3.80) with C-3 and C-9 (\u03b4C 63.5) and of H-11 (\u03b4H 3.95) with C-10 (\u03b4C 49.0) and C-13 (\u03b4C 41.6), which was further confirmed by the correlations of H-1/H-2 and H-9/H-11/H-12 in 1 H-1 H COSY spectrum. These spectral evidences indicated that 1 might be a ring B-seco limonoid bearing the same C, D and E rings with a 14\u03b2,15\u03b2epoxide identical with toonafolin (11) (Liu et al., 2012) , obtained also from the same plant source. The only significant difference between 1 and toonafolin was the presence of an acetyl group at C-29 in 1, which was further confirmed by the HMBC correlation of the oxygenated methylene protons at \u03b4H 4.77 and 4.41 (H-29) with the carbonyl carbon (\u03b4C 169.8) of the acetyl group. On the basis of the observation of ROESY data similar to those of 11, the stereochemistry of 1 was expected to be the same. Ring A should be nearer to a chair conformation, in which H-1 and H3-19 are eclipsed which was supported by ROESY correlations of H-1\u03b2 (\u03b4H 3.80) with H-2\u03b2 (\u03b4H 2.66) and H3-19 (\u03b4H 1.08).

Moreover, the existence of a correlation from H3-19\u03b2 to H-11 (\u03b4H 3.95) confirmed that H-11 is in the \u03b2and the oxide ring in the \u03b1-configuration. The configuration of the 14,15epoxide was deduced by NMR spectroscopic comparison with 1 and 11, which showed similar chemical shifts and proton coupling patterns. Consequently, compound 1 was unambiguously determined as toonasinenine A.",

            "text": "Compound 9 was assigned a molecular formula C27H36O8 established by a positive HR-ESI-MS. The 1 H NMR spectrum displayed six methyls (including one methoxy), one \u03b2-substituted furan ring (\u03b4H 6.17, 7.13, and 7.36) , and two olefinic methines [\u03b4H 6.28 and 5.97 (each, d, J = 11.8 Hz) ]. Additionally, an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated lactone (\u03b4C 166.7, 150.1, 121.5 and 83.6) was distinguished by analysis of its 13 C NMR and HMBC data. The above evidence showed that compound 9 was a tetranortriterpenoid sharing some similarity to toonayunnanin E (Liu et al., 2012) . The NMR difference indicated that the acetyl group at C-6 in toonayunnanin E was replaced by a hydroxyl group in 9, which was further confirmed by the upfield shift of C-6 to 70.1 in 9 and the HMBC correlations of H-6 (\u03b4H 4.69) with C-4 (\u03b4C 83.6) and C-10 (\u03b4C 49.1). The 14,15-epoxide ring and a hydroxyl group at C-8 in 9 was elucidated by the HMBC correlations from H3-18, H-16, H-17 and H3-30 to C-14 and from H-17 to C-15. The ROESY correlation of H3-30/H3-19\u03b2 suggested the \u03b1-configuration of 8-OH. The singlet of H-6 suggested that the dihedral angle between H-6 and H-5 is 90\u00b0in its preferred conformation, and the ROESY correlations of H-6/H-5, H-6/H-9, and H-6/H3-28 were consistent with a 6R* configuration. The configuration of the 14,15-epoxide ring was the same as 1 according to their similar ROESY correlations. Finally, the structure of 9 named toonayunnanin J was established.",

The IR absorptions at 1730 and 1615 cm \u22121 and the UV absorption at \u03bbmax 225 nm suggested an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester. The presence of an isobutyryloxy group, five methyls, three methylenes, ten methines (five olefinic, three of which due to \u03b2-substituted furan ring), and seven quaternary carbons (one olefinic attributed to \u03b2-substituted furan ring, two oxygenated, and two carbonyl), were indicated by analysis of the 1 H, 13 C NMR, and DEPT data. The ketonic carbonyl group located at C-7 was confirmed by correlations of H3-30, H-9, and H-5 to C-7 in the HMBC experiment. These data showed that 10 was an evodulone-class limonoid possessing the same ring fusion as 9. The 13 C NMR signals of 14,15-epoxide group [\u03b4C 69.7 (s), and 55.4 (\u03b4H 3.56, s, 1H)] were superimposable over those of 9. So the stereochemistry of the 14,15-epoxide was assigned to be in \u03b2-orientation. The HMBC correlations from H-12, H3-3\u2032, H3-4\u2032, H-2\u2032 to C-1\u2032 indicated that the isobutyryloxy group was attached to C-12. In the ROESY spectrum of 10, the correlations of H-12 with H3-19\u03b2 and H-17\u03b2, and of H-7 with H3-30\u03b2 and H-14, suggested that H-7 and H-12 were \u03b2-orientated. Thus, the structure of 10 was determined as toonayunnanin J.",

Among all compounds, B-seco limonoids 1-4 and 11 bearing 14\u03b2,15\u03b2-epoxide and 1\u03b1,11\u03b1oxygen bridge possessed the higher cytotoxic potential (IC50 value less than 15 \u00b5M) than 5-7 and 12 with only 14\u03b2,15\u03b2epoxide (IC50 value less than 25 \u00b5M) against all tested tumour cell lines except glioma cell lines. Additionally, limonoids 9 and 10 with a 14\u03b2,15\u03b2-epoxide in which A ring contain an \u03b1,\u03b2unsaturated lactone displayed particular cytotoxicities against two glioma cell lines. The tender leaves of T. sinensis are used as a nutritious and functional food for treating enteritis, gastric ulcers, rheumatoid arthritis, cervicitis, urethritis, tympanitis, dysentery, itchiness, and cancer. In screening radical scavenging activities, compounds 5 and 7-10 exhibited significant antiradical activities to the tested radical of DPPH and ABTS \u00b7+ . Due to their intrinsic structural variety, we were interested in establishing that \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone moiety in the ring A, capable of donating an electron and hydrogen atom by resonance hybrid and keto-enol Keto-enol tautomerisation, may strengthen the actions of radical scavenging character. Compounds 4 exhibited more significant antiradical activities on radicals of ABTS \u00b7+ than on DPPH assays, which may be elucidated by the mechanism difference that the ABTS \u00b7+ reactions involve electron transfer and take place at a much faster rate compared to DPPH radicals. 4 possesses high amount of phoenols which can take part in electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer reactions with many oxidising free radicals. In anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic bioassays, limonoids 1-4 and 11 bearing a 14\u03b2,15\u03b2epoxide have higher activities relative to 5-7 and 12 with 8\u03b1,14\u03b1epoxide. Among them, 4 exhibited the most significant antiinflammatory and cytotoxic activities with the lowest IC50. These result suggested the 14\u03b2,15\u03b2-epoxide and 1\u03b1,11\u03b1-oxygen bridge may be important and the \u03b3-lactone between C-4 and C-5 maybe strengthen for their anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic actions for this class of limonoids. In addition, limonoids 5 showed stronger cytotoxicities than 6, which indicated the 1,2-epoxy might be weaken the cytotoxic potential. Limonoids 9 and 10 displayed cytotoxic activities against gliom cell lines (IC50: 18.6 and 28.0 \u00b5M; 22.7 and 31.4 \u00b5M respectively). These result suggested that an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated lactone in A ring should be important for their particular cytotoxicities against gliom cell lines.",
