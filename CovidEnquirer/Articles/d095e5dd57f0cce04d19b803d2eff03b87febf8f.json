This study reports the molecular characterization of the virus and an abnormal pattern of circulating cytokines in a unique lethal CHIKV case during the 2017 outbreak in Italy, which involved an elderly patient with underlying cardiac disease. Analysis of inflammatory cytokines revealed a strong increase of interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, as well as interleukin-6, suggesting a possible role of type-I IFN in the cytokine storm, which may be correlated with unfavorable prognosis of CHIKV infection.",

CHIKV RNA levels detected in the corresponding patients are also shown. As can be seen, the IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IL-6 levels were extremely high in this fatal case as compared with nonfatal cases, whereas IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were in the same range. Although the small number of cases did not allow adequate statistical power, the levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IL-6 seemed not to be directly correlated to the levels of CHIKV RNA, as expressed by Ct values ( Figure 2 ). DISCUSSION CF is generally considered a self-limiting and nonfatal disease, although the accompanying symptom of severe incapacitating arthralgia is often persistent and can result in long-lasting disability [5] . This belief was debunked by the CHIKV outbreak on the Reunion Island in 2005-2006 when there were 266 000 cases and 254 deaths [7, 8] . CHIKV has been strongly suspected to have neurologic, hepatic, and myocardial tropism, leading to dramatic complications and severe clinical presentations with a high mortality rate (48%) [7, [9] [10] [11] . In fact, severe clinical forms are associated with the presence of several underlying medical conditions in about 90% of the cases, especially in elderly patients, and preexisting respiratory or cardiovascular diseases and hypertension have been recognized as risk factors of developing severe illness [7, 9] .",

In particular, IFN-\u03b1 is produced during CHIKV infection and has been shown to strongly inhibit CHIKV in vitro [14] . Therefore, the overproduction of type-I IFN is rather surprising in the lethal CHIKV infection here described. Elevated type-I IFN levels are known to be associated with clinical severity and poor therapy response in chronic diseases of viral (ie, hepatitis C virus and HIV) and autoimmune (ie, systemic lupus erythematosus) etiology [15, 16] , whereas overproduction in acute viral infections is rarely reported in humans. One report showed that in patients with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection, the concentration of IFN-\u03b1 and other cytokines, including IL-6, is correlated with the severity of the disease, suggesting that high levels of IFN-\u03b1 could not control SFTSV in humans but may be involved in the cytokine storm and in the virus pathogenesis [17] . Furthermore, a few studies have shown that abnormally elevated type-I IFN levels can cause morbidity and mortality, as opposed to protection, during influenza virus infection in animal models [18] .",

However, due to the extremely small number of CHIKV-infected patients and to the lack of comparison with uninfected patients with cardiac disease, from the present study it is not possible to establish whether CHIKV or the underlying cardiac dysfunction was the actual cause of the altered cytokine profile; it is also likely that infection, underlying morbidity, and elderly condition all contributed.",

Enhanced attention to unusually severe clinical presentation of CHIKV infection is endorsed by the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/wer/2015/wer9033. pdf?ua=1), and public health managers should remain cautious about the possible impact, from both human and economic standpoints, when facing a possible spread of the disease, as an increase in patient mortality could remain a plausible scenario.",
