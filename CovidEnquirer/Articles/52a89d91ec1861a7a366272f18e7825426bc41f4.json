A total of 63 differential host proteins were identified in BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells compared to non-infected OL cells. We found that most changes referred to alterations related to the pentose phosphate pathway, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and glycolysis /gluconeogenesis.

BDV infects a wide variety of mammal species (Ludwig and Bode, 2000; Hornig et al., 2003) . Infected animal hosts develop a large spectrum of neuropsychiatric pathologies ranging from immune-mediated neurological disease to non-inflammatory behavioral alterations (Ludwig and Bode, 2000) , which are notably reminiscent of symptoms observed in certain human neuropsychiatric disorders (Hornig et al., 2001) . Therefore, several studies have attempted to conclusively associate BDV with human psychiatric illness, but the findings remain controversial (Bode et al., 1995; Iwata et al., 1998; Kim et al., 1999; Fukuda et al., 2001; Ikuta et al., 2002; Bode and Ludwig, 2003; Hornig et al., 2012) . Regardless of this debate, a few human BDV strains could have been finally recovered in Germany, through laborious, long-term co-cultivation of freshly isolated white blood cells from psychiatric inpatients with a human oligodendroglial cell line (OL cells) . Genetic analyses could validate both the identity of BDV RNA in the original samples and the corresponding isolates, and their authenticity as human viruses, as they differ genetically from the laboratory reference BDV strain V and another lab strain termed C6BV by few but distinct and meaningful mutations in each gene (de la Torre et al., 1996) . Moreover, our previous metabonomic research has demonstrated that one of these human strains, BDV Hu-H1, which had been isolated from a severely depressed, hospitalized bipolar patient's PBMCs, perturbs energy metabolites in OL cells (Huang et al., 2012) . Even more interesting, our group could have found last year that BDV Hu-H1 differed remarkably from the laboratory-adapted BDV strain V. In fact, BDV Hu-H1 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in OL cells, while strain V displayed the opposite effects (Li et al., 2013) . Lab strain V was originally isolated from a diseased horse in Germany in the late 1920s, underwent numerous in vivo passages in rabbits and rats followed by multiple cell culture passaging.",

Oligodendrocytes are a major cellular component of the brain white matter that plays a pivotal role in maintaining neurological function via producing myelin proteins. Another human oligodendroglial cell line (HOG) derived from surgically removed oligodendrocytes was recent shown to be able to develop myelin-like sheaths (Bello-Morales et al., 2011) . OL cells had successfully served as target cells for several neurotropic NNS RNA viruses, e.g. canine distemper virus (Muller et al., 1995) , measles virus (Baczko et al., 1988) , and BDV Qian et al., 2010) . Although neurons are the major targets of BDV, the cell spectrum in the brain includes astroglia and oligodendroglia, as well (Carbone et al., 1993) . Various cell types and viral strains have been shown to differentially affect BDV's influence on the host (Williams et al., 2008; Poenisch et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2013) , including our above-mentioned study (Li et al., 2013) . However, a better insight into the mechanism, how BDV and the human strain in particular the human BDV strain manipulates its host cells in vitro, should support our understanding of BDV's neuropathogenesis in vivo.",

To achieve persistent infection and stable viral titration, the Hu-H1-infected OL cells (112 OL passages, 0 Hu-H1 passages) were cultured and passaged until all cells were infected with BDV Hu-H1 (142 OL passages, 30 Hu-H1 passages).

The six analytical gels were scanned using an Epson 10000XL scanner (Epson Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) at an optical resolution of 300 dpi. Image analysis and spot detection were accomplished with PDQuest software version 8.0.1 (Bio-Rad) using Gaussian spot modeling. For quantitative comparison of spots across gels, replicate images of the gels were created. To correct for the variability in silver staining, the individual spot volumes were normalized by dividing each spot's optical density (OD) value by the sum total OD of all spots in the respective gel. This method controlled for differences in sample loading and color intensities among the gels. Automated and manual spot matching were also performed.

Previous studies on enterovirus 71 and HCV have revealed significantly up-regulated enolase 1 in rhabdomyosarcoma and heptatocellular carcinoma cell lines (Takashima et al., 2005; Leong and Chow, 2006) . The here observed opposite effect of down-regulated enolase 1 in OL/Hu-H1 cells suggests a different mechanism of affecting host cell glycolysis. Interestingly, a previous metabolic analysis of HSV-1-infected cells indicates a bottleneck in glycolytic efflux at the step catalyzed by pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. This 'glycolytic bottleneck' was accompanied by increased levels of pentose phosphate pathway intermediates, thereby increasing the availability of ribose 5-phosphate (Vastag et al., 2011) .Therefore, the downregulation of enolase-1 observed in OL/Hu-H1 cells here could be an alternative 'glycolytic bottleneck'-based mechanism to increase the availability of ribose 5-phosphate -the aforementioned upregulation of transketolase 1 and phosphoglucomutase 2 in OL/Hu-H1 cells is consistent with this conjecture.",

            "text": "The cytoplasmic aconitate hydratase (aconitase) and cDNA FLJ51705 (highly similar to mitochondrial aconitate hydratase) were significantly dysregulated in opposing directions. Aconitate hydratase catalyzes the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate in the TCA cycle and has a dual subcellular localization in the cytoplasm and mitochondria displaying differences in sensitivity to stimulation, inhibition, and stability (Hernanz and de la Fuente, 1988; Eprintsev et al., 2002) . Therefore, one or more of these isoforms may be involved in regulatory activities independent of their traditional metabolic activities, producing the simultaneous up-regulation of one isoform and simultaneous down-regulation of another isoform observed here. Consistent with our findings, a previous proteomic study of BDV He/80infected cortical neurons also found significant dysregulation of mitochondrial aconitate hydratase (Suberbielle et al., 2008) . A comprehensive systems level study that includes transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic lines of analysis should clarify the precise Fig. 5 . Cell proliferation assay with and without ERK inhibitor U0126. Cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay. Hu-H1 infection decreased OL cell proliferation. ERK inhibitor U0126 decreased OL cell proliferation but did not decrease OL/Hu-H1 cell proliferation. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD of four independent experiments with similar results. \u2044 p < 0.05 comparing to control. Fig. 6 . Immunofluorescence and co-localization analysis of pERK1/2 in nucleus. (a) OL/Hu-H1 cells and control OL cells were analyzed for the expression of activated ERK in nucleus by immunofluorescence. (b) BDV Hu-H1 induced lower pERK in nucleus than control OL cells (p = 0.04), suggesting impaired nuclear translocation of pERK. mechanism(s) by which BDV Hu-H1 impacts energy metabolism in human OL cells.",

            "text": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction cascades have been implicated in a variety of cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, cell activation, immune responses and apoptosis (Pearson et al., 2001; Kurokawa and Kornbluth, 2009 ). In mammalian cells, three MAPK families have been thus far characterized: ERK, which is activated by growth factors, peptide hormones and neurotransmitters, Jun kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK, which are both activated by cellular stress stimulus as well as growth factors (Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999) . The Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade is activated by many viruses, including BDV and several other human pathogenic RNA viruses (e.g., influenza, Ebola, HCV, and SARS-CoV) (Pleschka, 2008) .Here, by initial manual querying, two proteins associated with the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade were found to be significantly altered in OL/Hu-H1 cells compared to control cells (arrows represent up/downregulation in OL/Hu-H1 cells compared to control cells): PEBP-1\" and CrkL;. PEBP-1, alternatively termed Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), regulates Raf/MEK/ERK signaling activity by competitively disrupting the interaction between Raf and MEK, thereby negatively interfering with the downstream activation of MEK and ERK (Yeung et al., 1999) . CrkL has been shown to activate the Ras/Raf signaling pathway and transform fibroblasts in a Ras-dependent fashion (Senechal et al., 1996) . CrkL is down-regulated in OL/Hu-H1cells compared to control cells. Interestingly, in neurons, such down-regulation has been shown to block dendritogenesis during the development of the CA1 region in the hippocampus in vivo under specific conditions (Matsuki et al., 2008) .Based on these initial findings, we hypothesized that the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade was perturbed in OL/Hu-H1 cells. Therefore, five key Raf/MEK/ERK signaling proteins (i.e., p-Raf, p-MEK, p-ERK1/2, p-RSK, and p-MSK) were selected for Western blotting validation (Fig. 4a ). P-ERK1/2 and p-RSK were found to be significantly up-regulated, and p-MSK was found to be significantly down-regulated, in OL/Hu-H1 cells compared to control cells; however, there was no significant dysregulation observed in p-Raf or p-MEK (Fig. 4b) . These combined findings indicate that BDV Hu-H1 activates the downstream ERK-RSK complex of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in human OL cells (Fig. 4c) . RSK, a substrate of ERK and a mediator of ERK signal transduction, is composed of two functional kinase domains that are activated in a sequential manner by a series of phosphorylations; MSK is a RSKrelated kinase activated by ERK as well as p38 MAPK (Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999) . The activated ERK-RSK complex observed here has several proposed functions, including: (i) regulation of gene expression through phosphorylation of transcriptional regulators, such as NFjB/IjBa, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), and CREB-binding protein; (ii) regulation of protein synthesis by phosphorylation of polyribosomal proteins and glycogen synthase kinase-3; and (iii) phosphorylation of the Ras GTP/GDP-exchange factor, Sos, leading to feedback inhibition of the Raf/ MEK/ERK pathway (Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999) .Many viruses manipulate the contributing kinases but differently in accord to their life cycles (Leong and Chow, 2006; Predmore, 2011; Vastag et al., 2011) . Notably, BDV He/80 has also been shown to activate the Raf/ MEK/ERK signaling cascade in several persistentlyinfected mammalian cell lines (Planz et al., 2001) . In this study, BDV Hu-H1 was found to activate the ERK1/ 2 pathway, as well. As up-regulated pERK should increase the proliferation of cells (Seger and Krebs, 1995; Pearson et al., 2001) , the CCK-8 experiment was conducted (Fig. 5) to detect proliferation and growth. In contrast to the higher ERK1/2 expression of BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells, we found down-regulation of proliferation which was stronger than in uninfected control OL cells treated with ERK inhibitor U0126 which is apparently contradictory. However, a similar finding have been reported by Hans et al., namely that BDV activated the ERK1/2 pathway in a persistently-infected neural crest-derived cell line (PC12), but at the same time decreased the differentiation in PC cells, due to impaired translocation of ERK1/2 to the nucleus . We were able to show the same effects in pERK co-localization immunofluorescence assays, comparing OL/Hu-H1 cells and control OL cells (Fig. 6) . Impaired translocation of key signal transduction kinases might be associated with the trafficking of viral proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and vice versa, involved in nuclear replication, a unique feature of the family Bornaviridae among the order Mononegavirales (de la Torre, 1994).Impaired translocation may at least partially explain our findings of up-regulated pERK and down-regulated proliferation in OL cells infected with a human strain of BDV. Inhibited cell proliferation was previously observed in human but not laboratory BDV (Li et al., 2013) . Given the complex regulatory network between the ERK/RSK pathway, cell proliferation and programed cell death by apoptosis in multiple mammalian cell lines (for review Kurokawa and Kornbluth, 2009 ), the precise manner by which BDV Hu-H1's activation of the ERK-RSK complex interferes with cell proliferation and the other biological processes warrant further research.",
