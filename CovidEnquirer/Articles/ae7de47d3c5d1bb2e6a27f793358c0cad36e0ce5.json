In addition to its function as a structural protein, N protein is involved in cell apoptosis or cell-cycle regulation. N protein possibly interacts with host factors to modulate cellular functions. To identify cellular proteins that interacted with N protein of TGEV, methods of GST pulldown and Co-IP were utilized to precipitate cellular proteins of swine testicular (ST). Bound cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Analysis of interacting proteins by mass spectrometry allowed identification of 15 cellular protein bands representative of 12 cellular proteins including vimentin that bound to N protein. Furthermore, the function of vimentin cytoskeleton in ST cells during TGEV infection was examined. Vimentin cytoskeleton was required for virus replication. The present study thus provides protein-related information about interaction of TGEV N protein with host cell that should be useful for understanding host cell response to coronavirus pathogenesis infection and the underlying mechanism of coronavirus replication.",

            "text": "Recently, some reports showed that N protein of TGEV play an important role in host cell for virus replication. N protein of TGEV facilitates template switching and is required for efficient transcription (Zuniga et al., 2010) . N protein underwent proteolysis in parallel with the activation of caspases within host cell and N protein of TGEV is a substrate for caspases (Eleouet et al., 2000) . TGEV N protein nucleolus localization was found in transfection experiments and might induced a cell cycle delay or arrest to facilitate virus replication (Wurm et al., 2001) . In contrast, TGEV N protein was not accumulated in the nucleus in the infection context (Calvo et al., 2005) . In addition, the role of TGEV N protein in cell cycle arrest has been recently reported (Ding et al., 2014) . N protein of TGEV may function through direct or indirect interaction with cellular proteins. For better understanding of the mechanisms associated with pleiotropic functions of N protein, cellular proteins of swine testicular (ST) cells were pulled down associated with N protein using glutathione (GST)-tagged full-length N proteins immobilized on GST agarose. And cellular proteins of ST cells were precipitated using N protein mAb. By SDS-PAGE coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), a total of 12 cellular proteins interacting with N protein were successfully identified. Information on the expanded repertoire of cellular proteins interacting with N protein will provide a framework for future biochemical analyses of these protein functions in TGEV infection.",

            "text": "CoV replication uses complex mechanisms that involve viral and cellular proteins. Similar to other positive-strand RNA viruses, CoV genome replication takes place in the cytoplasm in a membraneprotected microenvironment that contains all the protein required for viral RNA synthesis (Enjuanes et al., 2006) . Electron microscopy studies of mouse-hepatitis-virus-infected cells have shown that replication complexes of virus consist of double-membrane vesicles (Gosert et al., 2002) . CoV replication complex formation possibly utilizes components of cellular autophagy (Prentice et al., 2004) . Although CoV replication essentially takes place within the cytoplasm, the virus may control cell machinery by locating some of its proteins in host cell nucleus (Enjuanes et al., 2006) . In the present study, vimentin was identified in pull-down assay and Co-IP assay, suggesting that it plays an important role in TGEV infection. Costaining of cellular vimentin and N protein on immunofluorescence microscopy also supported an association between proteins. Based on these findings, we speculate that vimentin plays a role in TGEV replication.",

The proteins had statistically significant protein score of great than 59 (p \u2264 0.05) were considered successfully identified.Fig. 2. MALDI-TOF MS spectra and TOF/TOF spectra of vimentin.",
