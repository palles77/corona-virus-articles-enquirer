            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex in calves impairs health and welfare and causes severe economic losses for the Stockperson. Early recognition of BRD should lead to earlier veterinary (antibiotic/ anti-inflammatory) treatment interventions thereby reducing the severity of the disease and associated costs. Coughing is one of the clinical manifestations of BRD. It is believed that by automatically and continuously monitoring the sounds within calf houses, and analysing the coughing frequency, early recognition of BRD in calves is possible. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to develop an automated calf cough monitor and examine its potential as an early warning system for BRD in artificially reared dairy calves. The coughing sounds of 62 calves were continuously recorded by a microphone over a three-month period. A sound analysis algorithm was developed to distinguish calf coughs from other sounds (e.g. mechanical sounds). During the sound recording period the health of the calves was assessed and scored periodically per week by a trained human observer. Calves presenting with BRD received antibiotic and/or anti-inflammatory treatment and the dates of treatment were recorded. This treatment date reference served as a comparison for the investigation of whether an increase in coughing frequency could be related to calves developing BRD. The calf cough detection algorithm achieved 50.3% sensitivity, 99.2% specificity and 87.5% precision. Four out of five periods, where coughing frequency was observed to be increased, coincided with the development of BRD in more than one calf. This period of increased coughing frequency was always observed before the calves were treated. Therefore, the calf cough monitor has the potential to identify early onset of BRD in calves.",

            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a multifactorial disease in cattle caused by a variety of pathogens. It affects both the upper and lower respiratory tract and the lungs of cattle (Poulsen and McGuirk, 2009 ). BRD involves a wide variety of infectious agents. These include viruses such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI3), bovine coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1), as well as bacteria such as Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Pasteurella multocida and Mycoplasma bovis. BRD is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in calves (Busato et al., 1997; Dutil et al., 1999; Windeyer et al., 2014) . Busato et al. (1997) monitored 100 Swiss suckler beef herds from birth to wean-ing, in one generation of calves, and reported a pre-weaning calf mortality rate of five per cent. Over 50% of these mortalities were due to respiratory disease. Similarly, in a study of 467 suckler beef herds in Canada, Dutil et al. (1999) reported a pre-weaning calf mortality rate of 5.4% in herds with less than 40 females, and 5.6% in herds with 40 or more females. Of these recorded cases of mortality, 12.8-17.5% was due to respiratory disease. Windeyer et al. (2014) observed a case fatality risk for BRD of 7.1% in dairy heifer calves on commercial dairy farms in Minnesota and Ontario. In the Republic of Ireland, respiratory disease is the main cause of mortality in calves from one to three months of age. Almost 30% of calves between one and three months of age submitted to the Veterinary Laboratory Service in 2012 for necropsy died as a result of respiratory disease (All-Ireland Animal Disease Surveillance Report, 2012). Recognised risk factors for dairy calf mortality during the rearing period include calf birth weight, colostrum intake, milk feeding practices, housing, age at weaning and exposure to infectious disease (Brickell et al., 2009a, b; Sivula et al., 1996; Speicher and Hepp, 1973) . However, the impact of these risk factors on calf mortality is often inconsistent across studies (Brickell et al., 2009a,b) .",

These sound events could be calf coughs, bird sounds, creaking of the fence, etc. Finally, 5739 events, including the 385 labelled coughs, were found in the labelled sound data. Thus, 385 per 5739 or one per fifteen sound events detected was considered a cough.",

To reduce the information in this feature a straight line was fitted through the durations based on reducing the squared error (Fig. 4) .

The example based classifier compared the rough spectrum values of a sound event on each time and frequency value with those of a labelled cough. The comparison was done with the Euclidean distance between the two rough spectrograms. This resulted in a Euclidean distance value per sound event. The lower the value the more a sound event resembled the labelled cough. If F ijl represents the rough spectrogram of sound l at time i and at frequency j and G ijm the rough spectrogram of labelled cough m, then the Euclidean distance e lm between both is calculated as There was a big spread in resemblances between the rough spectrograms of labelled coughs. A few sound events labelled as coughs did not have a comparable rough spectrogram to the majority of labelled coughs. Other sound events labelled as coughs were only comparable to a restricted number of other labelled coughs. To consider these irregular coughs, a weighted threshold was developed on the Euclidean distance value. The higher the threshold, the more a sound event could deviate from that labelled cough, or the higher the Euclidean distance value could be. This threshold was chosen as the highest Euclidian distance value which achieved a precision of 90% for that specific labelled cough in the training set. This method is a simplified version of a pig cough detection algorithm from the literature . This version is faster compared with their use of a dynamic time warping method (Rabiner and Juang, 1993) . The threshold t m for each labelled cough m had to fulfil the following equation in which the result between square brackets is either 1 if true or 0 if false. The threshold was found by exhaustively going over all thresholds t m .",

These differences could possibly be explained by different building acoustics of the houses or a different set-up of the sound recording equipment. The performance results of Table 3 shows that the recordings of house 3 were more different compared to the two other houses. This difference in recording had previously been remarked by the labeller. The table further shows that the calibration step improved the performance in house 3 as intended but decreased the sensitivity with two percent in house 2 ( Table 3 ). The reason for the decreased sensitivity was not investigated as the performance was still acceptable. This showed that calibration mainly improved the house that sounded differently and this difference will most likely happen in practice. This performance difference also demonstrates that applying the pig coughing algorithms as described in literature on another experimental set-up is probably not straightforward.",

In house 3, GS2 indicated that there were calves presenting with BRD but this did not correspond to either GS1 or an increased coughing period. Therefore, it appears that GS1 was better correlated than GS2 with the increased coughing periods.

Therefore, we analysed the time between an increased coughing period and treatment for BRD. The animals were always treated after or during a period of increased coughing (Figs. 9 and 10 ). This suggests that the veterinarian could have started the treatment earlier. How much earlier the treatment could have started is dependent on when the algorithm detects an increased coughing period. In the current paper this detection was not yet automated but visually assessed based on the number of coughs. Therefore, it was not possible to quantify how much earlier. These results show for the first time that detection of coughs may indeed be an early warning system for calves presenting with BRD. Instead of only using visual inspections in the calf house to detect BRD an automated cough detection method can assist the Stockperson in recognising BRD.",

Between 23 h and 12 h there were on average 38% more coughs than between 13 h and 22 h. The greater number of coughs could be explained due to husbandry management between 7 h and 12 h (including feeding and cleaning, replenishing of bedding, health observations) disturbing the calves. Calves were consequently more active in the morning hours than during the afternoon.",

Period 2 in house 1 lasted from the 20th to the 26th May while period 3 of house 2 lasted from the 21st to the 23th May. This agreement was likely due to the transfer of infection between houses as they were adjacent to each other.",

This calf cough detection algorithm achieved on average 50.3% sensitivity, 99.2% specificity and 87.5% precision. Even with the low sensitivity a total of five periods with increased coughing were observed. For all five periods, a number of calves were treated for BRD during or after the observed coughing period. This indicates that automated detection of coughs may be an early warning system for calves presenting with BRD. This automated cough detection method could thus assist the Stockperson in recognising BRD alongside visual inspections in the calf house.",
