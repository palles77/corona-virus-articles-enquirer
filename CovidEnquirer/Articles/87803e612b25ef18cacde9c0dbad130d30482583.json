            "text": "Louis Pasteur first used the term vaccine in 1881 for immunogens directed at other diseases besides smallpox. Pasteur directed many investigations that demonstrated the feasibility of attenuating or inactivating microbes. Studies with fowl cholera and anthrax led to the concepts of chemical inactivation as a means to reduce the virulence of microorganisms. 4, 5 Studies with erysipelas and rabies explored serial passage in animals (lapinization or passage through rabbits) or other animal derived tissues as an alternative strategy to reduce or eliminate virulence. 6 Thus, the virulence of infectious microbes could be completely or partially reduced. These studies have led to the eventual successful control of anthrax and rabies in particular. The work of Salmon and Smith 7 (1886) clearly demonstrated that some microbes could be completely inactivated (killed). These developments eventually led to successful immunization programs against typhoid fever, tuberculosis, rinderpest, and foot and mouth disease (FMD). Attenuation and inactivation principles were extended to microbial toxins by the work of Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute. 8 A tetanus toxoid was developed in 1924 through heat and formalin inactivation of the toxin to form an ''anatoxin.'' Also, enhanced efficacy was provided by absorbing the toxoid to an aluminum hydroxide, providing an adjuvant effect. These process and formulation improvements were developed and refined in the early twentieth century, first through production of equine sera with antidiphtheria and antitetanus toxin-neutralizing antibody for prophylactic use. In the modern era of vaccine use, these same basic technologies are still the mainstays of vaccine production. However, new generations of recombinant, nucleic acid and subunit vaccines have become available. It is remarkable that the principles of developmental research, registration, and manufacture still follow the techniques of the grand heritage.",

More often than not these vaccines were produced in regional research institutions. Industrialization of the processes began in the 1930s and 1940s when large-scale, controlled processes were used to produce FMD antigens in Germany by Waldmann and colleagues. 9 The development of first primary and subsequently clean cell lines occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. Development of high-volume roller bottle methods and later large-scale bioreactors has made possible the production of millions of doses of vaccines. 2 Further, production has been maintained in secure, closed systems, enhancing the security for the environment as well as the technical staff. In like manner, improvements in inactivation technologies (cyclized binary ethyleneimines), purification and concentration of antigens, storage of bulk antigens, improved aluminum gels, and oil suspension adjuvants in the formulation of polyvalent antigens have been critical achievements in the steady advancements in vaccinology. 2 As these technical advances were employed in the industry, independent and collaborative efforts by numerous governmental authorities created regulatory frameworks that have established regulations and guidelines for registration of new biologicals as well as consistent manufacture of pure, safe, and potent vaccines. Under these regulations all released lots of vaccines are tested to ensure consistent formulation characteristics and potency (immunologic strength), safety, and purity (sterility and freedom from contamination with extraneous biologic agents). Development of Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines and master seed and master cell stock concepts has further ensured consistent manufacture of vaccines that will provide consistent immunogenicity and efficacy. A veterinary clinician therefore may use with confidence any approved vaccine as recommended by the manufacturer to achieve the anticipated clinical outcome of protection.",

The routine use of processed immunoglobulins (usually in the form of processed horse serum) preceded the use of vaccines.

Rabies vaccination is usually first given at 4 months of age. 14 It is a common and efficacious practice to provide booster doses at 1 year of age for most vaccines. 14 These immunization practices will provide a solid duration of immunity of at least 5 to 7 years and longer in some cases. General recommendations (World Small Animal Veterinary Association) are to vaccinate every third year after the initial immunization series, and these recommendations are consistent with product label guidelines. 12 These initial immunization guidelines are derived from the initial registration immunogenicity and efficacy studies for any individual vaccine product. The efficacy studies define the minimum immunologic strength for the vaccine (the potency that must be present when the vaccine lot goes out of date). These same types of studies also define the minimum age of animals that can be successfully immunized as well as the specifics of the initial and booster immunization regimens (part 9, Code of Federal Regulations). It has Vaccines in Veterinary Medicine become very clear that many vaccines provide effective and long-term immunity for an extended period of time. 11 Over the past 3 decades, cumulative evidence for extended duration of immunity has been provided to support the 3-year booster intervals for most vaccines in dogs and cats.

Based on clinical and microbiological outcomes of an efficacy study challenge of immunity, various degrees of protection may be achieved and therefore claimed.

For instance, antibody-mediated neutralization of rabies virus in extracellular spaces inhibits transmission to neurons and subsequent axonal progression of the virus to the central nervous system. In this case the presence of preformed, neutralizing antibody is critical for protection. A summary of protective characteristics of the immune responses to vaccines (as potential correlates of protection and disease prevention) is provided in Table 2 . Although antibody responses are good correlates of protection, they do not always reflect all available protective mechanisms provided by a well-differentiated immune response. In some cases, other correlates are available. It is clear that the presence of neutralizing, vaccine-derived antibody will reduce mucosal virus replication, virus shedding, and viremia in kittens vaccinated with modified live feline herpes vaccines. [20] [21] [22] However, regulated CD41 and CD81 cellular responses are required to control tissue damage and reactivation of disease. 23 In this case, antibody may be a protective correlate of infection while cellular immunity is a protective correlate of disease. The ability of modified live vaccines to generate a very rapid onset of cytokines and interferons (and rapid antigen focusing in dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues) is associated with a rapid onset of protection, even though antibody responses may not be detectable in serum for up to 2 weeks. [20] [21] [22] Therefore, the early response of multiple cytokines and concurrent activation of the innate immune system may serve as early correlates of protection.",

However, the presence of detectable neutralizing serum antibody is correlated with protection against recrudescent disease. 23 In situations where vaccinated animals may be exposed to heterotypic viruses or bacteria, the presence of immune CD41 T cells specific to conserved antigens may be very important for protection. 24 It is possible that the effective mechanisms for development of protection associated with a vaccine may be specific to the nature of the disease and infectious process. Recent studies have provided important information regarding this phenomenon. A common hypothesis is that vaccine-induced immunity should reflect convalescent immunity following natural infection. For example, It is known that recovery from primary poxvirus infections requires robust cytokine responses, natural killer cells, and antibodies as well as T helper (CD4) and cytotoxic T (CD8) lymphocyte effector functions. 25 However, recovery from a secondary infection requires only T-and B-lymphocyte interaction and an anamnestic antibody response. Again, neutralizing antibody will reduce infection, viremia, and spread of a virus (and may do so to the extent of blocking infection) while T-cell-mediated responses will allow survival and recovery. It seems clear that balanced antibody and cellular responses are necessary for complete protection from infection and disease as well as spread to other animals.",

Similar adjuvant particles can be generated with no antigen (ISCOMATRIX) that can be admixed directly with antigen suspensions. These advanced formulations may be used to provide very efficient adjuvants to in turn allow development of microvolume formulations as well as transdermal applications. Also, as better understanding of immune genotypes and phenotypes in animal populations emerges, individualized formulations of vaccines may be developed and produced that may enhance safety and efficacy. 30 Proteomic technologies may very well provide methods to identify antigen subsets from among complex organisms and infectious agents such as bacteria and protozoa. These organisms contain large, complex genomes. Antigen expression is often dependent on growth conditions, and the medium may be very complex. 31 These conditions are difficult to reproduce and regulate in vitro. The combination of transcriptional and proteomic analysis may provide a means to identify key antigens associated with tissue or cellular persistence and potential virulence. Such analyses could provide means to simplify vaccine formulations to include only protective antigens and reduce the presence of nonprotective, potentially interfering bacterial proteins. Not only would this potentially improve efficacy, but it could also improve safety profiles by reducing the antigenic mass in a vaccine dose.",
