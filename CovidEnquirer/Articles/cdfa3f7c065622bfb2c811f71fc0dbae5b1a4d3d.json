In this study, viral metagenomics was used to identify what viruses are present in Rhipicephalus spp. ticks collected in the Zambezi Valley of Mozambique. Methods: The RNA was amplified with sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and high-throughput sequencing was performed on the Ion Torrent platform. The generated sequences were subjected to quality check and classfied by BLAST. CodonCode aligner and SeqMan were used to assemble the sequences. Results: The majority of viral sequences showed closest sequence identity to the Orthomyxoviridae family, although viruses similar to the Parvoviridae and Coronaviridae were also identified. Nearly complete sequences of five orthomyxoviral segments (HA, NP, PB1, PB2, and PA) were obtained and these showed an amino acid identity of 32-52% to known quaranjaviruses. The sequences were most closely related to the Wellfleet Bay virus, detected and isolated from common eider during a mortality event in the USA. Conclusions: In summary, this study has identified a highly divergent virus with in the Orthomyxoviridae family associated with Rhipicephalus ticks from Mozambique. Further genetic and biological studies are needed in order to investigate potential pathogenesis of the identified orthomyxovirus.",

At the amino acid level, the reads showed closest similarity to members of the Quaranjavirus genus, such as the Wellfleet Bay virus (WFBV), Tjuloc vius (TLV), Quaranfil virus (QRFV), Johnstol Atoll virus (JAV) and unclassified quaranjaviruses. No significant similarities were observed at the nucleotide level. Assembly of these reads generated 6 contigs with high sequencing depth and lengths ranging from 218 to 2353 nucleotides (nt) ( Table 3) . BLAST searches of these contigs revealed that they show similarities to the nearly full-length segments of Wellfleet Bay virus and Tjuloc virus ORFs: Hemagglutinin (HA), Nucleoprotein (NP), Polymerase basic 1 protein (PB1), Polymerase basic 2 protein (PB2), and Polymerase Acidic protein (PA) ( Figure 2 ). However, the identified ORFs exhibit high genetic diversity to known quaranjavirus genomes, with an amino acid identity of only 32-55%, indicating that these represent novel viral sequences belonging to the Quaranjavirus genus. One of the contigs (contig6, 218 nt long) showed an amino acid identity of 55% to the NP protein of WFBV; however, it did not assemble with the other NP-classified reads in the data set. The BLAST hit results for this contig included a hypothetical protein of the Tjuloc virus and Quaranfil virus with an identity of 32%. This contig could, therefore, be a matrix protein or another viral protein divergent from previously known quranjaviral segments. The 3\u2032 UTR sequences of the HA and NP sequences were recovered using RACE analysis. The 3\u2032 UTR could not be recovered from the other segments, nor could any 5\u2032 UTR be recovered. Evolutionary relationships was analyzed using PB1 as it is considered the most conserved of the orthomyxovirus genes. The phylogenetic analysis of the PB1 protein sequences, including Influenza A, B, C, Thogotovirus and Quaranjavirus, showed that PB1 from the novel quaranjavirus, identified in this study, formed a separate branch in the quaranjavirus group and was most closely related to WFBV (with 100% bootstrap support) ( Figure 3 ).",

            "text": "In this study, a metagenomic approach was used to identify viruses associated with Rhipicephalus ticks in the Zambezi Valley of Mozambique where the surveillance of tick-associated pathogens is limited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where high-throughput sequencing have been used to explore the viruses present in ticks from Mozambique. The majority of the viral sequences belonged to the Orthomyxoviride family and was therefore studied in more detail; however, other viral families such as Parvoviridae and Coronaviridae were also identified. Many of these viral sequences showed very low sequence identity The contigs aligning to the amino acid positions of the closest relative and its identity to known viruses, indicating that they most likely correspond to novel viruses. The Orthomyxoviridae family consists of six recognized genera: Influenza A, B, and C, Isavirus, Thogotovirus, Quaranjavirus and the newly proposed Influenza D. Viruses in this family infect a broad range of hosts including humans, birds, swine, fish and arthropods, and transmission occurs by different routes such as fecal-oral, water, air, and direct contact [20] . The genus Quaranjavirus was approved by ICTV in 2011 and included two new species, Quaranfil virus (QRFV) and Johnston Atoll virus (JAV), as well as a tentative member, Lake Chad virus (LKCV). These viruses were isolated in the 1950s and 1960s but were only recently recognized as quaranjaviruses. They appear to be mainly associated with ticks (QRFV and JAV) and birds (LKCV) [21] [22] [23] [24] . In the present study, novel viral sequences showing sequence identity to quaranjaviruses were characterized from Rhipicephalus spp. ticks in Mozambique using high-throughput sequencing. These sequences are highly divergent from all known quaranjaviruses, with approximately 50% amino acid identity. BLASTx search analyses show that these sequences are most closely related to WFBV and TLV. In the phylogeny, the PB1 protein sequence from this study clustered with quaranjaviruses and showed closest relationship to WFBV. At this point, we are not sure if the sequences found in this study belong to one, two or more viruses. Future studies are needed to show this. The mechanism of transmission is uncertain, but it is speculated that soft and hard ticks are the primary vectors [25, 26] . Several studies have identified quaranjaviruses in other arthropod vectors, such as spiders, mosquitoes and horseflies [27] . Little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of quaranjaviruses. The viruses in this genus are globally distributed throughout the Middle East, Africa and Pacific regions. Parvoviruses are associated with a variety of chronic diseases in humans and animals. However, these viral sequences have the ability to integrate into the chromosomal DNA of a wide range of hosts and may transmit to offspring. The parvovirus sequences identified in the current study had closest similarity to non-structural protein 1 of different densoviruses, which were shown previously to integrate into tick genomes such as in Ixodes, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera [28, 29] . We assume that these sequences are either endogenous viral elements of the tick genome or DNA from densoviruses remaining in the RNA due to incomplete DNase treatment during the sample preparation step.",

For instance, Coxiella endosymbionts of Amblyomma ticks impair the transmission of Ehrlichia chaffiensis [31] . Further, in another important arthropod vector, the mosquito, the Wolbachia symbiont can limit the replication of several pathogenic viruses such as Dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus and different protozoans such as Plasmodium [32] [33] [34] . It has also been demonstrated that pathogens may influence the microbiome of arthropod vectors by modulating immune responses for its survival and infection [35] .
