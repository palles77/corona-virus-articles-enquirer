Advice-giving seems to be a common interpersonal strategy in weather commentaries in many Chinese newspapers, yet research into weather advice-giving is greatly lacking. This study investigated whether the discourse of advice-giving in newspaper weather commentaries differed depending on the newspaper source and/or on the weather reported. We focused on two popular metropolitan newspapers: Beijing Morning Post and Beijing Evening News. Forty texts from each source were chosen (20 for ordinary weather and 20 for extreme weather). Results showed that the advice given stems from a vast reservoir of advice themes, and we found clear differences depending on weather, with significantly more advice given during extreme events. We also found that Beijing Evening News, in general, provided more advice in their weather commentaries. Finally, writers who were prone to take an authoritative stance tended to increase their use of imperatives and ''high-status'' vocatives during extreme weather, whereas those who positioned themselves ''with'' their readers also used more imperatives, but did not change their vocative preferences.",

Importantly, the China Meteorological Administration developed an information sharing mechanism that also includes the Xinhua News Agency, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the State Administration of Radio Film and Television. Thus, full use of newspapers, radio and television, as well as new media outlets, has become a vital part of Chinese disaster communication (Yang and Mao, 2012) .",

To meet the needs from agriculture, industries, commercial www.elsevier.com/locate/pragma expectations between teacher and student. Culpeper et al. (2008) found that while mentors in general seem to value optionality and solidarity-enhancing talk over directive and authoritative discourse in their interactions with foreign language assistants, mentors in France favoured solidarity-enhancing discourse, coupled with a directive style, to a greater extent compared to those in England. Similarly, through the linguistic analyses of vignettes, DeCapua and Dunham (2012) examined the types of advice-giving and the relational strategies employed by students preparing to be teachers of young children. They concluded that the type and frequency of components of advice-giving vary according to topic, that the components interact with each other to set the tone of advice, and that relational strategies work to mitigate the threatening force of advice-giving, promote bonding and good relationships between the advice-giver and seeker. Both Angouri (2012) and Vehvil\u00e4inen (2012) have focussed on ''problem-solving'' interactions featuring direct questions. Vehvil\u00e4inen found that Finnish supervisors use question-answer sequences (i.e. question preface) to allow the student's knowledge and perspective to surface; insight that in turn can be used to tailor the advice, and thus minimise the lilkelihood of the advice falling on deaf ears.",

            "text": "In health-related or medical contexts, Heritage and Sefi (1992) and Heritage and Lindstr\u00f6m (2012) observed home visits with first-time mothers. Heritage and Sefi observed that mother-initiated advice is infrequent and could be in the form of straightforward question-answer sequences or in a more cautious and indirect way by describing a state of affairs as problematic. Advice-giving initiated by health visitors, on the other hand, occur much more frequently and often in a stepwise way. Interestingly, Tully et al. (1997) found that consumers and pharmacists have different ideas concerning who needs advice and when and how advice should be given. Zayts and Schnurr (2012) studied how medical providers interactionally manage the tension between giving advice and ensuring patient autonomy, typically by framing their responses as giving information rather than giving advice. They are also more direct when patients' advice-seeking is framed as questions around other aspects than the medical decision. Based on their research of two Internet advice columns on sexual health, Harvey et al. (2013) claimed that advice-giving is a delicate act to carry out because of ''inescapable messages of authority, expertise and intimacy in advice' ' (DeCapua and Huber, 1995:128) and is thus generally considered to be face-threatening in Anglo-western contexts (Goldsmith and MacGeorge, 2000; Vine, 2004) . Therefore, they proposed the importance for advice-givers to think about linguistic strategies to mitigate the threatening force of advice-giving. Harrison and Barlow (2009) showed that the face-threatening aspects of advice-giving can be successfully addressed in peer-to-peer advice-giving through indirect strategies, such as indirect suggestions framed as declaratives or rhetorical questions. This study, which focused on online self-management for people with arthritis, made a special note of the use of personal narratives, which serve both as an indirect strategy for giving advice, and a positive politeness strategy demonstrating shared concerns and experiences.",

            "text": "Advice-giving in call-in radio advice programmes is commonly framed by mitigation strategies; for example, hosts tend to avoid direct language forms by adopting the same terms as clients when describing a third party's advice (Hudson, 1990; Pudlinski, 2005) . They also use hedges (e.g. maybe) and the imperative, when inquiring about a further more specific safe course of action, and refer to an expert when clients implicitly seek advice. DeCapua and Dunham (1993) revealed that hosts prefer to use explanations, elaborations and narrations to help clients' advice-seeking. Going further, Pudlinski (2012) described how hosts can pursue advice that is initially rejected by the caller. He identified three sequential and functional strategies: interrogating for information about the caller's own experiences, supporting the advice with additional accounts, and expressing concern or worry to further extend advice pursuit. Drescher (2012) identified some cultural differences after comparing patterns of advice-giving in phone-in programmes in French and Cameroonian cultures, while Emmison and Firth (2012) concluded that the delivery of advice is often constrained by particular institutional practices. In an investigation of online Spanish peer-to-peer advice-giving, Placencia (2012) identified Guidance as the core move. In her study of advice letters on the Internet, Locher (2006) noticed an overall preference for hedging as a face-saving strategy. Morrow (2006) analysed online British texts and uncovered an informal style of advice-giving, expressing positive regard and solidarity. Following this study up, Morrow (2012) turned to Japanese advice-giving on the internet. He observed that generally advice is framed in polite question forms and that advice-givers often take an empathetic stance by recounting their own experiences and using first person plural volitional forms.",

Comparing advice-giving in Chinese and English, Lu (2014) discovered that Chinese speakers think about the social power relationship much more than English speakers. Yan (2011) revealed that most advice-giving speech acts in forum response posts on the issue of love on the Internet are direct and are framed in the form of imperatives (see Li, 2009 for a historical account of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic forms of advice-giving). Similarly to Waring (2007 Waring ( , 2012 , Ren (2013) found that adviser-initiated advice is enacted in a typical sequence: pre-advising (i.e. making comments, inquiring, etc.), advising, and post-advising (i.e. providing explanations).

Before moving on with a second forecast that predicts the weather over the weekend, the writer includes the advice: ''Drive slowly''. This advice is brought on by the forecasted fog and low visibility. There is further advice given after the weekend forecast, namely to enjoy the autumn as winter is coming, as well as the more implied advice: ''it is fit for a day out''.

The function of optional elements may account for the variations in the texts that belong to the same genre. In this case, a single GSP can generate a large number, or if recursion is involved, an infinite number of actual structures with the variable realisation of each element. In other words, a potentially infinite number of actual texts can occur as exemplars of the same genre. Hasan's GSP allows a systemic and consistent description of generic structures of instances of texts in terms of the elements included. Since some elements may be common to different genres, and the more elements two genres share, the more similar they will be.",

Our examples also show that a component can occur more than once in a commentary.

Thus, the Chinese public very much welcome experts' instructions on how to cope with and prepare for different types of weather.

For instance, during the disastrous flood on 21 July 2012, which was the worst flood in over 60 years, many of those who were caught in the heavy rain panicked because they had never experienced such a big flood before (Wang et al., 2013b) . In addition, the rescue system collapsed. As a result, 79 people in total died in the flood, including a driver who was drowned because he stayed in his car and was subsequently unable to escape, as well as two young university students who chose to swim across a flooded bridge. It is possible that if they had benefitted from professional instructions or advice before the event, they might have stood a better chance at survival. It is quite likely that events such as this one have (or will) gear the Chinese newspapers to offer more substantial weather-based advice during extreme events in the short-term and climate change in the long-term.",

BEN writers seemed to portray themselves as experts or authorities who are supposed to possess more meteorological knowledge --which was typically found in the forecast component -than ordinary people, and who are responsible for offering relevant advice to lay people. Another popular place for advice-giving was the ending. The popular topics here were a healthy diet, health care and disease prevention during the specific season in question.

This non-use is probably due to advice in the ending usually being relaxing health care suggestions or recommendations that very often are independent from the rest of the commentary (Example 4). Such advice would not serve the serious or emergent tone of advice-giving favoured in BEN, especially not during adverse weather. In sum, the typical GSP of Chinese weather commentaries could be summarised as: (overview)^forecast^(ending). 1 In this linear structure, the overview and the ending are optional elements; whereas the forecast is obligatory. We discovered that advice often occurs after information related to future weather in each component. Although, we were forced to merge overview and review into one component, it is worth mentioning that we found no instances of advice in this component that related to past weather. Possibly this was because such advice would be useless or that the relevant advice had already been included in the forecast component the day before.",

When autumn is beginning to approach the end, people tend to feel sad and lonely in autumn as depicted ever since ancient times, especially so on continuous rainy days. Apart from local climates, TCM was found to be another source of inspiration for advice-giving. TCM theorists believe that body functioning, health maintenance and even dietary habits have close connection with various weather conditions and with the seasons or times of the year. Active adaptation to the change of the seasons in terms of life style and diet can help keep fit and prevent diseases. The failure to do so may result in health decline and eventually in diseases. Accordingly, the corpus revealed that health care or dietary habits based on TCM were popular topics in advice-giving as shown in Example 11.",

This study sought to address differences and similarities in advice-giving and advice themes between two different Beijing newspapers, and in particular asked whether the type of weather commented on affected the degree of advice-giving. Our results reveal that weather related advice-giving was abundant, especially during extreme events. In terms of content, the variety of climate facts and the vast reservoir of medical theories on health contributed to a large number of advice themes in the weather commentaries: from ordinary weather to extreme weather, from daily activities to special occasions, from everyday health care to prevention of seasonal diseases. Thus contrary to de Beaugrande's presumption, Chinese weather forecast texts are highly informative, with the quantity and quality of weather-related advice varying reliably and appropriately in accordance with the present weather.",

For Beijing Evening News, we found a similar pattern for the high-status vocative sh\u00ecm\u00edn, where again the journalists utilised this linguistic device to display authority more during extreme events. Beijing Morning Post, on the other hand, showed a clear preference for the equal-status addressing term p\u00e9ngy\u01d2 u regardless of the type of weather. While appropriate use of high-status addressing terms can increase the feeling of authority or reliability of advice, the use of equal-status addressing term can add credit to the intimate writer-reader relationship.

Since the purpose behind advice-giving tends to be to urge compliance with the advice, we can assume that the different writers have deliberately chosen to pursue compliance by these different means. It is very possible that the writer's selfpositioning to the putative readers affects the willingness and likelihood to comply with the advice. Future studies should attempt to investigate the extent to which readers' compliance with advice is determined by the use of vocatives and imperatives. ",
