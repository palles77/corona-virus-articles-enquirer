In order to provide a brief review of the two groups, i.e. the Pan American Group for Rapid Viral Diagnosis (PA-GRVD) and the Clinical Virology Symposium (CVS) joining together, the readers are referred to the following three chapters. We hope this booklet will provide useful information for those interested in Clinical Virology, including physicians, medical students, interns, and residents as well as laboratory and research investigators.",

Stanley Plotkin, the president of the PA-GRVD, suggested to have the two groups join together for their annual meetings in Clearwater, Florida. (see Stanley Plotkin memorandum to officers and council members of PAGRVD on April 25, 1986) . Support for the concept was indicated by John Sever's letter to Stanley Plotkin (dated April 29, 1986 ). On May 7, 1986, a letter from Steven Specter and Gerald Lancz was sent to Stanley Plotkin agreeing with the above suggestions. Joseph Waner was the newsletter editor and ensured that the news regarding PAGRVD and the CVS would have joint annual meetings in Florida for the coming years, (Joseph Waner's letter to Steven Specter on May 28, 1987).",

Dr. Sever indicated that there was a need for such a meeting in the East since the Medical Virology meeting was mostly individuals from the Western USA. Dr. Sever had participated in three previous meetings in clinical virology that Dr. Specter had helped to organize and indicated that he would be a good person to begin such a meeting. After some additional coaxing from Dr. Sever and a conversation with Dr. de la Maza, Dr. Specter decided to pursue organization of the meeting. In the fall of 1984 Dr. Specter attended the ICAAC meeting and while there, attended the annual meeting of the Pan American Group for Rapid Viral Diagnosis (PAGRVD). At that session Dr. Specter invited the society to co-sponsor the meeting and to honor their Wellcome Diagnostics award recipient Edwin Lennette, M.D., Ph.D. at the symposium banquet.

This basic format covering these three areas of clinical virology has been perpetuated for the entire length of the series; although, the number of presentations per session has decreased so that from 1995 and later there have been four per session.

The Clinical Aspects session was changed to day 1 and the Diagnostic session was switched to day 2 so that the second day would be all Diagnostic Virology. In 1990 the Sunday Workshop was our first on PCR and was held for a full day; it returned to the one-half day format the next year but was discontinued in 1992. In 1991 the oral presentation of abstracts was replaced by a panel discussion, which was very well received and has continued. Panel Discussions were expanded in 1992 and two panel discussions replaced the Workshop that had been held on Sunday afternoon. In 1994, the 10 th CVS, we replaced one of the panel discussions with a series of clinical case presentations. These were highly praised and have been included as part of the symposium on an annual basis. In 1997 we lost a dear friend and active participant in the case presentations, Phil Hanff.

Improved reagents were being made and used by the comprehensive diagnostic laboratories, and commercial companies were beginning to put resources into making products available to all laboratories. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health was beginning to consider rapid viral diagnosis as a potential discipline worthy of support. In that atmosphere, The Pan American Group for Rapid Viral Diagnosis (PAGRVD) was founded in 1977 by a small group of forward-thinking virologists with clinical and basic science interests. The salient mission of the Group was to promote the development and application of techniques that would make the diagnosis of viral infections rapid. The nature of viral diagnosis at the time was such that the Group was small in number and thereby able to communicate experiences and to exchange reagents more readily. PAGRVD was not only a vehicle that focused technology but the Group also provided an educational resource to a skeptical clinical community. This was accomplished through a program of workshops and symposia and NIH-funded contracts that went to members of the Group. An important event in the evolution of the PAGRVD occurred in 1987 when the annual general meeting of the PAGRVD began convening in conjunction with the Clinical Virology Symposium held in Clearwater Beach, Florida each year. This occasion is described in an accompanying article.",

New members came into the Group and non-member attendees were exposed to the tenets of the PAGRVD. However, within a few years changes in the culture of the PAGRVD were beginning to be evident. Retrospectively, it seems that the success of the PAGRVD was a major factor in influencing the changes. By the early 1990s, rapid viral diagnosis was a reality and new technologies were being adapted to achieve ever more rapid and sensitive detection of viruses. There were good commercial sources of reagents and diagnostic kits, and the emerging biotech industry had become an important adjunct to the clinical laboratory. As is customary with the passage of time, a younger generation of virologists that had not experienced the formative years was also emerging.",

At the Annual General Meeting held April 30, 1991, there was discussion about the possibility of broadening the mission of the Group and possibly changing the name to include other non-viral pathogens, such as chlamydia and mycoplasma. The majority of the members felt that they would prefer to maintain the name Pan American Group for Rapid Viral Diagnosis (Newsletter, V.17, No. 2, 1991) .",

A viewpoint developed that the focused aims of the PAGRVD were fading into the broader scope of clinical virology. Defining clinical virology was more difficult than one might suppose, particularly in relation to the defined mission of the PAGRVD. Although never formalized or articulated per se, in hindsight, it seems that the working definition became synonymous with the content of the Virology Symposium and the heterogeneous backgrounds and interests of the attendees. Max Chernesky, one the founders of the PA-GRVD and the Group's fourth President, wrote an article for the March, 1994 issue of the PA-GRVD Newsletter that discussed the history and aims of the PAGRVD. Chernesky's article put the PAGRVD in perspective relative to the issues that other members believed could more appropriately be dealt with in a society with a new name. He further suggested that if a new name was instituted, the PAGRVD could be retained as a subgroup within a new society.",

At the subsequent Annual General Meeting a few hours later, the President recommended that the membership consider the new name to reflect the inclusion of all aspects of clinical virology. Max Chernesky reviewed the history of the PAGRVD following the Executive Council's recommendation and suggested that a new mandate with specific objectives should be drafted.

Plotkin's further comments stated that the Group's emphasis should remain 'rapidity of diagnosis' and that clinical virology was implied in the term diagnosis. Chernesky forwarded Stan Plotkin's letter to Steve Specter, the presidentelect of the PAGRVD at the time, and to the PAGRVD Council. He included a covering letter with constructive suggestions for new organizational arrangements that could retain an identity for the PAGRVD and expand the designated interests of an altered entity. To summarize, the salient issue appeared to be whether the traditional mission of the PAGRVD and the name should persist while expanding the scope of the Group to deal with new issues or whether rapid diagnosis would be submerged into a more encompassing society of clinical virology. Similarly, in 1994 the European Group for Rapid Viral Diagnosis (EGRVD) was discussing its own history and evaluating future aims (article by Dick Madeley, Chairman EGRVD, to the EGRVD, April 22, 1994) . Since publication of that article, the EGRVD has become the European Society for Clinical Virology and the Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Virology has become the Journal of Clinical Virology.",

The name PASCV was used officially for the first time in the title of the Newsletter (V. In 1993, David Myerson mentioned at the PA-GRVD meeting that he could set up a listserver and explained that all members could get email if it was sent through the listserver. Actually that was quite a bit more than David could do, but the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center computer people were up to the task, and he just requested that the appropriate server be set up. It was set up as pagrvd@mule.fhcrc.org in May 1994, and David emailed everyone who had addresses with instructions on how to sign up. Pretty soon he had more than 100 members, as email access increased. The name was changed in July 1995 to pascv@mule.fhcrc.org when the organization's name changed, and pascv@pony.fhcrc.org in 1998 when the server was changed.
