It is predicted the development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 will take one year to 18 months, by which time it is likely that several hundreds of thousands to millions of people may have been infected. With a rapidly growing number of cases and deaths around the world, this emerging threat requires a nimble and targeted means of protection. Since coronaviruses causing COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are able to suddenly transfer to humans from diverse animal hosts that act as viral reservoirs, there is a pressing need to develop methods to combat other potential coronaviruses that may emerge in the future [1] [2] [3] . A recent report further showed two strains (L and S) of SARS-CoV-2 with different genome sequences are circulating and likely evolving, further highlighting the need for a pan-coronavirus vaccination strategy 4 .",

The SARS-CoV-2 life cycle is likely similar to closely related coronaviruses such as the virus that causes SARS, in which the virus enters the cell, releases its RNA genome into the cytoplasm, and synthesizes negativesense genomic and subgenomic RNAs from which viral mRNAs and a new copy of the positive sense viral genome are synthesized (Fig. 1A) 6, 7 . Whereas traditional vaccines work by priming the human immune system to recognize viral proteins or weakened viruses and decrease viral entry into cells 8 , the alternative antiviral approach we propose here relies on a CRISPR-based system for recognizing and degrading the intracellular viral genome and its resulting viral mRNAs (Fig. 1B) . Targeting the positive-sense genome and viral mRNAs to simultaneously degrade viral genome templates for replication and viral gene expression would be expected to robustly limit viral replication.",

Cas13d employs CRISPR-associated RNAs (crRNAs) that contain a customizable 22 nucleotide (nt) spacer sequence that can direct the Cas13d protein to specific RNA molecules for targeted RNA degradation. The high catalytic activity of Cas13d in mammalian cells provides a potential mechanism for targeting SARS-CoV-2 for specific viral RNA genome degradation and viral gene expression inhibition. Because of its small size (967 amino acids), high specificity, and strong catalytic activity, we chose Cas13d rather than other Cas13 proteins to target and destroy RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus (IAV) [10] [11] [12] .",

At the time of paper submission, there is no widely available laboratory strains of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we tested our approach using synthesized fragments of SARS-CoV-2, as well as with live H1N1 IAV. We designed and screened a panel of crRNA pools targeting conserved viral regions and defined the most effective crRNAs.

Manuscript analysis revealed a group of six crRNAs that can target 91% of sequenced coronaviruses, as well as a group of 22 crRNAs able to target all sequenced coronaviruses. The potential pancoronavirus protection using CRISPR-Cas13d offers an alternative and complementary approach over traditional pharmaceuticals or vaccines. Through the use of crRNA pools targeting different regions of the same virus or different strains of coronavirus, this system could possibly buffer against viral evolution and escape, as well as enable rapid development and deployment against emerging viruses. When combined with an effective delivery platform, PAC-MAN is a promising strategy to combat not only coronaviruses including that causing COVID-19, but also a broad range of other genera of viruses. author/funder.

Our results revealed similar patterns to our SARS-CoV-2 transfection experiments, with the best groups (G4, G5, G8) able to repress their reporters by 69%, 71%, and 60% (p = 7x10 -6 , 10 -3 , 3x10 -6 for G4, G5, G8, respectively) (Fig. 3C) . qRT-PCR analysis also showed consistent results, with G4, G5, and G8 repressing 70%, 68%, and 49% of RNA abundance (p = 8x10 -8 , 4x10 -6 , 10 -4 for G4, G5, G8 respectively) (Fig. 3D) .",

We also did an analysis of the extent to which expression of Cas13d or crRNAs affected SARS-CoV-2 GFP reporter inhibition. Our analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition was more sensitive to crRNA concentration in our samples, while lower Cas13d expression only moderately decreased inhibitory activity (Fig. S3B) . Thus, maintaining a high level of crRNA concentration is likely a determining factor for more effective SARS-CoV-2 sequence targeting and cleavage.",

The segment ends are potentially attractive regions for targeting with Cas13d because of the potential to inhibit a broad range of IAV strains and because of the previous evidence that interfering with the packaging of one segment encoded on the segment ends can decrease the packaging efficiency of other segments and overall virion packaging 18, [22] [23] [24] [25] . Using sequence representation from ~140 different strains of influenza, we designed crRNAs that could be robust across as many different IAV strains as possible.

To do this, we transfected a pool of 6 crRNAs targeting a given IAV genome segment. Two days after crRNA transfection, the Cas13d A549 cells were challenged with PR8-mNeon, a strain of H1N1 IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) engineered to express the mNeonGreen gene, a fluorescent reporter protein (hereafter referred to as PR8-mNeon) at an MOI of 2.5 or 5.0 [26] [27] [28] . At approximately 18 hours post-challenge, the cells were analyzed for IAV infection through flow cytometry and microscopy. We examined the percentage of cells that were mNeon positive for each segment-targeting crRNA pool and calculated the fold-change compared to cells transfected with a pool of non-targeting crRNAs). Out of all crRNAs, the crRNA pool targeting segment 6 (S6) delivered the most consistent and robust results across different MOIs (72% reduction for MOI = 2.5 and 52% reduction for MOI = 5; Fig. 4B, S4) . Additionally, the segment 4 (S4) pool also showed moderate but consistent inhibition. To verify Cas13d-mediated inhibitory effects on S4 and S6, we further tested at a lower MOI of 0.5, which showed better inhibition of IAV across samples (e.g., 79% reduction using crRNAs targeting S6; Fig. S5 ). This confirms consistent inhibitory activity of IAV by Cas13d when targeting these two segments. There is a possible trend of greater inhibition at lower viral titers, suggesting that Cas13d PAC-MAN could be a particularly effective strategy for prevention of new infections, which typically occurs from exposure to a low level of virus.",

This expands the applications of CRISPR-Cas13 systems in addition to their uses for diagnostics such as SHERLOCK and live-cell imaging [30] [31] [32] [33] . Prior work showed Cas13a/b systems could inhibit ssRNA viruses including influenza, which is consistent with our observed high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 reporter and IAV inhibition using the PAC-MAN approach 31 . We demonstrated that Cas13d-based genetic targeting can effectively target and cleave the RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 fragments and IAV in lung epithelial cell cultures. Our bioinformatics analysis also suggested a minimal pool of 6 crRNAs able to target over 90% of sequenced coronaviruses. While this strategy is a proof-of-concept and will require further testing using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and validation in animal models before clinical tests in humans, it represents a unique approach to implement a rapid and broad antiviral defense in humans against emerging pathogens for which there are no effective vaccines.",

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these genome regions encode the RdRP and Nucleocapsid proteins, which are essential for coronavirus replication and function 13, 34 . RdRP is responsible for catalyzing the replication of all viral mRNAs and Nucleocapsid binds to genomic RNA, protecting it and serving as one of the two main structural proteins in virions. Targeted inhibition of these proteins could have an outsized effect on disabling virus production and function, in addition to reducing viral load through degradation of the viral genome itself. For IAV, the crRNAs that showed the best viral inhibition target the conserved ends of the segment S6 that encodes Neuraminidase (NA), a viral surface protein essential for mediating budding of new virions 35 . Prior mutation analysis has shown that mutating the packaging signals of one segment end leads to decreased packaging of other segments, indicating that there is a cooperative mechanism for packaging the IAV genome 18 . Thus, by inhibiting a single IAV genome segment, we could reduce the overall packaging of IAV in a synergistic fashion.",

Traditional vaccines rely on priming the immune system through exposure to viral proteins or peptides often derived from surface proteins that exhibit a high rate of mutation, which increased the chances of viral evasion of the host immune response 44 . In contrast, here we have demonstrated a genetic strategy that is able to target highly conserved regions, which would be expected to make it much more unlikely for the virus to escape inhibition through mutation. In addition, the ability of Cas13d to process its own crRNAs from a crRNA array means that multiple crRNAs targeting different regions (e.g. Fig. 3E , and PAC-MAN-T6 in Fig. 5A ) could be delivered simultaneously 9 , further reducing the chances of viral escape. As a further advantage, we demonstrate a potential pan-coronavirus strategy to target not only viruses that circulate in humans, but also those that currently are found in animal reservoirs that might transfer to humans to cause disease. If the crRNAs targeting these viruses can be tested and validated before they ever infect humans, we can greatly accelerate the development of countermeasures for future emergent threats.",

A hash table was used to map each crRNA candidate to the number of Coronavirinae genomes that it targets with a perfect match. A greedy algorithm was used to identify a minimal set of covering crRNAs. In each iteration, the crRNAs were sorted in descending order by the number of genomes targeted. The crRNA that targeted the most genomes was added to the minimal set of crRNAs, and all of the genomes it targeted were removed from the hash table values. If multiple crRNAs were tied for targeting the most genomes, the crRNAs were ranked by the length and quantity of stretches of repeated nucleotides, and the lowest ranking crRNA (i.e. the one with the fewest, shortest stretches of repeated nucleotides) was added to the set of minimal crRNAs. Using this approach, a set of 22 crRNAs was identified that was able to target all 3150 Coronavirinae virus genomes (including 47 SARS-CoV-2).
