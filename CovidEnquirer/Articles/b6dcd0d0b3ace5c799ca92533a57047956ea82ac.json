CNS infection causes acute encephalitis that is characterized by the destruction of a large number of CNS neurons, especially in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, brain stem, and in the anterior horns of the spinal cord.

Following intracerebral infection, these strains replicate in neurons in the brain resulting in encephalitis similar to that observed with the GDVII strain but nonlethal. The virus is cleared from the brain by the host immune response but persists in the spinal cord, eventually resulting in the development of chronic demyelinating disease (Lehrich et al., 1976; Lipton, 1975; Njenga et al., 1997; Rodriguez et al., 1987) . The disease is characterized by viral persistence in oligodendrocytes (Rodriguez et al., 1983) and macrophages , with chronic demyelination and progressive loss of motor function . The pathology is largely immune mediated with animals demonstrating a range of disease phenotypes depending on their genetic background. In the SJL strain, demyelination is evident within 30 days after infection. By 90 days, infected animals begin to develop spasticity and gait abnormalities, and weakness of the lower extremities, with paralysis eventually occurring by 6 to 9 months (Lipton and Dal Canto, 1976a) .",

Pretreatment of virus with heparin sulfate, treatment of host cells with heparin sulfate cleaving enzymes, or treatment with heparin sulfate speciWc antibodies all inhibit GDVII binding and infection (Reddi and Lipton, 2002) . Proteoglycan deWcient CHO cells are resistant to infection, further supporting a role for proteoglycans in GDVII binding. The interaction of proteins with heparin sulfate is usually mediated by heparin-binding domains (HBD) and a heparin-binding domain consensus sequence has been described (Cardin and Weintraub, 1989) . A putative HBD is present in the amino acid sequence of the VP1 capsid protein of both the GDVII and TO subgroups. This sequence may play a role in the binding of GDVII to heparin sulfate but if so, conformational diVerences must exist between VP1 peptides of the TMEV subgroups because the TO subgroup viruses do not bind heparin sulfate. Proteoglycans are known to serve as co-receptors or attachment factors for a variety of diVerent viruses. For several of these viruses, heparin sulfate acts primarily as an attachment factor and is not fully suYcient to mediate virus entry. The extent to which additional protein entry receptors are needed for GDVII infection is not yet clear (Reddi and Lipton, 2002) .",

This is in contrast to the high level of viral genome that is present throughout the disease (Trottier et al., 2001) . Infected cells most often appear in the lateral or anterior columns of the thoracic spinal cord and the presence of infected cells is often accompanied by an inXammatory parenchymal inWltrate and perivascular cuYng. The diVuse inXammatory inWltrate consists of large numbers of CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T lymphocytes, activated macrophages and microglia, B cells, and reactive astrocytes (Fig. 44.3; Lindsley et al., 1989) . The presence of inXammatory cells correlates closely with the development of myelin damage, and electron microscopy reveals inWltrating mononuclear cells stripping myelin from axons. Macrophages containing engulfed myelin debris are numerous in demyelinating lesions. The speciWc roles that these diVerent cell types play in the development of demyelination and neurologic deWcits will be discussed in subsequent sections. Demyelination is apparent by as early as 22 days after infection and in many mouse strains, as demyelination progresses, neurologic deWcits begin to appear. Demyelination pathology is illustrated in Figure 44 infected mice involves not just the disruption of neuronal function but neuronal and axonal loss as well (McGavern et al., 2000) . Quantitative assessment of CNS injury during TMEV-induced disease shows that signiWcant atrophy of the lateral and anterior white matter regions of the spinal cord can be detected by 45 days post-infection. Atrophy is most pronounced in the posterior cervical and anterior thoracic regions of the spinal cord. While levels of demyelination reach a peak by 100 days post-infection, spinal cord atrophy continues to increase between 100 and 220 days. A 25% reduction was observed in the area of the anterior and lateral white matter at the C8-T11 level of the spinal cord by 195 to 229 days after infection. In this study, atrophy was speciWcally assessed in areas of normal appearing white matter and not in lesion areas, to avoid complications due to area changes resulting from inXammation and edema. This marked spinal cord atrophy is the result of a 30% loss of medium to large axonal Wbers by 195 to 229 days post-infection. The progressive loss of axons correlates well with electrophysiologic changes in the spinal cord and with changes in motor ability. These observations demonstrate that the neurologic deWcits that develop during chronic TMEV-induced demyelinating disease are primarily due to axonal damage and loss rather than to demyelination alone.",

Infection with recombinant DA virus that contains these GDVII regions results in death at a much reduced LD 50 compared to wildtype DA virus. Subsequent studies narrowed the critical segment to a region of P1 from 1B to 1D, the capsid coding region . Several studies have since conWrmed that major determinants of viral persistence lie in the region of the viral genome that encodes the capsid proteins and have identiWed regions in two of these proteins, VP1 and VP2, that appear to be necessary for persistence (Adami et al., 1998; Lin et al., 1998) .

The TO strains use an alternative initiation codon to produce L*, a protein whose coding sequence is out of frame with the polyprotein reading frame. The GDVII strains do not encode the L* protein. Mutations in L* dramatically decrease virus-induced demyelination indicating that it plays a role in the development of disease (Chen et al., 1995) . The L* protein is essential for replication of the DA strain in a macrophage-like cell line in culture, while the GDVII strain does not replicate in these cells (Takata et al., 1998) . L* appears to function by preventing apoptosis of the DAinfected cells (Ghadge, et al., 1998) . The production of the L* protein therefore plays an essential role in the ability of TO subtype viruses to persist in speciWc cell types in the CNS. Analysis of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in the CNS of mice infected with L* mutant virus, suggests that the inhibition of apoptosis by L* may prevent development of virus-speciWc cytotoxicity, permitting persistent virus infection and demyelinating disease .",

The typical observation that only very small numbers of infectious virus can be recovered from chronically infected spinal cord initially led to the notion that the virus persists at low levels in the tissue. However, recent quantitative studies on the level of viral RNA in the CNS have demonstrated the presence of large amounts of full-length viral RNA, about 10 9 copies/spinal cord, throughout the course of the chronic disease (Trottier et al., 2001) .

Upon intracerebral infection with virus, resistant strains mount an anti-viral immune response that controls virus replication and eventually clears virus from the animal. Upon clearance, infectious virus, virus antigen, and viral RNA can no longer be detected. Susceptible strains also mount a strong immune response against virus but virus is not cleared. A persistent viral infection is established along with the development of demyelinating disease, as described earlier. Since virus clearance is mediated by the immune response, mutations that disrupt major functional elements of the immune system generally result in some level of susceptibility, even in an animal with an otherwise resistant genetic background. The eVects of mutations of this type will be discussed in subsequent sections. Here we review naturally occurring genetic loci that act as modiWers of the response to TMEV infection and that have been identiWed using standard techniques of genetic analysis in mice.",

            "text": "Early studies with diVerent strains of mice demonstrated a wide range of susceptibility to TMEV-induced disease (Lipton and Del Canto, 1979) . F1 and F2 backcrossing experiments between resistant and susceptible strains revealed that several loci were important for virus clearance and that one of these loci was linked to the H-2 major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 17 (Lipton and Melvold, 1984) . Further genetic analysis of this region showed that mice with certain H-2 haplotypes (H-2 f, p, q, r, s, v ) are susceptible to persistent virus infection, while others (H-2 d,b,k ) conferred resistance (Rodriguez and David, 1985) . Resistance was a dominant eVect and mapped to the D region of the H-2 complex, suggesting that a class-I mediated element of the immune response was essential for virus resistance (Clatch et al., 1985; Rodriguez et al., 1986b) . Direct demonstration that an H-2 linked class-I gene was responsible for virus resistance was provided when the H-2D d class-I gene was introduced into a susceptible mouse strain and these transgenic animals were shown to be resistant (Azoulay et al., 1994) . A key role for class-I restricted CD8 \u00fe T cells as eVectors of resistance has since been conWrmed with targeted mutations in CD8 and b2-microglobulin (which lacks MHC class-I function). Both of these mutations result in TMEV susceptibility in animals with otherwise resistant genetic backgrounds (Fiette et al., 1993; Murray et al., 1998; Pullen et al., 1993; Rodriguez et al., 1993) . The H-2D b gene exerts its eVect on the stimulation of virus-speciWc CTL through the presentation of an immunodominant peptide from the VP2 capsid protein: VP2 121-130 (Dethlefs et al., 1997; Johnson et al., 1999) . There are other class-I molecules whose peptide binding sites are identical to those of the D locus and therefore have the potential to present TMEV peptide. These molecules, however, have not been shown to play a role in establishing resistance, possibly due to diVerential patterns of expression or to structural diVerences outside of the peptide binding domain that are important for antigen presentation (Altintas et al., 1993; Lin et al., 1997a) .",

Mice with severe combined immunodeWciency (SCID) normally die from acute encephalitis when infected with TMEV. Adoptive transfer of normal spleen cells can result in survival and the development of demyelinating disease, but the results of adoptive transfer depend critically on the number of cells transferred . Transfer of too few cells fails to ameliorate the SCID phenotype and most mice die. Transfer of too many cells results in complete virus clearance and the mice survive but do not develop disease. Only when an intermediate number of cells is transferred do the surviving mice develop persistent virus infection and demyelination. These results demonstrate the balance between immune activation and virus persistence that determines the quality and extent of demyelinating disease.",

In cultures of mixed neonatal brain cells, TMEV infection of oligodendrocytes is primarily lytic (Graves et al., 1986; Rodriguez et al., 1988) . Two days after infection, many cultured oligodendrocytes display cytopathic ultrastructural changes characteristic of picornavirus infection, such as numer-au9 THEILER'S MURINE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS VIRUS (TMEV) ous cytoplasmic vacuoles and disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum, with preservation of mitochondria (see Fig. 44 .2). The number of oligodendrocytes in these cultures begins to diminish within 48 hours after infection and by 7 days has decreased to 50% of the value in uninfected control cultures (Rodriguez et al., 1988) . Since TMEV infects oligodendrocytes in vivo (Graves et al., 1986; Ohara et al., 1990; Rodriguez et al., 1988) and kills these cells in vitro, demyelination as a direct cellular consequence of the infection of oligodendrocytes seems plausible.",

In these studies, infection of BALB/c nu/nu mice with the DA strain of TMEV resulted in the development of signiWcant neurologic deWcits by 2 to 3 weeks and death within 4 to 8 weeks. Demyelinated foci were observed in the spinal cord by 14 days post-infection even though inXammatory inWltrates were minimal. Electron microscopy revealed numerous infected and degenerating glial cells, some that were identiWed as oligodendrocytes. Damaged myelin was observed around intact axons as well as completely demyelinated axons. In general, the demyelinated lesions in these mice were small and inXammation is minimal compared to what might be expected in most susceptible strains of mice, suggesting that other mechanisms of demyelination may normally play a more prominent role. However, these observations do indicate that TMEV-induced glial damage can occur in the absence of a T-cell mediated immune response.",

Rodriguez (Rodriguez et al., 1983; Rodriguez, 1985) reported ultrastructural abnormalities of the innermost extent of the myelin sheath and has proposed a ''dying back'' mechanism for demyelination. In persistently infected SJL mice, the inner tongue of the myelin sheath, which is the most distal extent of the myelin lamellae, often exhibits swelling and abnormalities in the normal cytoachitecture. Abnormalities included vacuolization, degeneration of mitochondria, increased numbers of microWlaments, and the appearance of electron-dense bodies and debris. These indications of damage to the innermost layer of the myelin sheath were observed in the absence of any signs of damage to the external surface of the sheath, indicating that damage to the oligodendrocyte may occur before immune-mediated damage to the myelin surface. Immunoperoxidase studies revealed that viral antigen was present on both the inner and outer extents of the myelin lamellae, even though the ultrastructural abnormalities were restricted to the inner loops. The observed degeneration appears to begin in the inner loop of the oligodendrocyte lamellae and then proceeds proximally toward the cytoplasm with the ultimate destruction of the myelin sheath.",

MHC class I, in particular, is known to be upregulated in oligodendrocytes following TMEV infection of the CNS (Altintas et al., 1993; Lindsley et al., 1992) . In susceptible mouse strains, class-I MHC is up-regulated in the CNS by one day after infection and remains high in the spinal cord white matter throughout chronic infection and demyelination. A novel antigen such as viral peptide, presented on the cell surface by MHC class-I, might generate a class-I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, which might cause primary demyelination as the result of chronic nonlethal injury to TMEV-infected oligodendrocytes. However, mice with a disrupted b 2microglobulin (b 2 -m) gene do not express signiWcant levels of MHC class-I, do not have functional CD8 \u00fe T cells, and therefore cannot mount a CTL response. When b 2 -m knockout mice from a resistant haplotype are infected with TMEV, resistance is abrogated and the virus establishes persistent CNS infection. However, signiWcant demyelination develops in these mice (Fiette et al., 1993; Pullen et al., 1993; Rodriguez et al., 1993) , demonstrating that CD8 \u00fe class I-restricted cytotoxic T cells are probably not the primary mediators of CNS demyelination. In general agreement with these observations, b 2 -m knockout mice from a susceptible haplotype display somewhat enhanced levels of demyelination (Begolka et al., 2001) .

However, both the timing and mechanisms of demyelination and axonal damage can be distinct and diVerent in the TMEV model. Quantitative assessment of demyelination and neurologic ability in two susceptible mouse strains shows that small demyelinated lesions, accompanied by statistically signiWcant decreases in motor ability, can occur as early as 24 days post-infection . However, axonal damage and neurologic deWcits do not necessarily follow demyelination. Several reports have documented that deWciency of MHC class-I (b 2 -microglobulin mutants) or MHC class-II (Ab o mutants) function, will abrogate resistance to TMEV-induced disease in otherwise resistant strains of mice (Fiette et al., 1993; Njenga et al., 1996; Pullen et al., 1993; Rodriguez et al., 1993) . Resistant mice that are homozygous for either of these mutations develop extensive demyelination. However, class-II deWcient mice develop severe neurologic deWcits as indicated by signiWcant reductions in spontaneous activity, while class-I deWcient mice show no clinical signs. Electrophysiologic measurement of the conduction velocity of motor-evoked potentials shows that decreased conduction velocities accompany deWcits in class-II deWcient mice with chronic demyelination. Conduction velocities in class-I deWcient mice are no diVerent that those in uninfected controls . These Wndings demonstrate that demyelination and neurologic deWcits are genetically and functionally separable, and they implicate a role for MHC class-I in the development of neurologic deWcits following demyelination.",

C57BL/6 mice mount a vigorous CTL response to TMEV. This response is predominantly directed against a single immunodominant TMEV peptide that represents amino acids 121 to 130 of the VP2 capsid protein, which is presented in the context of the H-2D b MHC class-I molecule (Borson et al., 1997) . At 7 days post-infection, staining of CD8 \u00fe brain inWltrating lymphocytes with D b :VP2 121-130 tetramers shows that 50 to 63% of the inWltrating CD8 \u00fe cells are virus speciWc (Johnson et al., 1999) . Mice with a targeted disruption of the Ifn-g receptor gene respond to virus infection with rapidly progressing disease and severe clinical deWcits. These mice also develop a class-I restricted anti-viral response that is dominanted by the VP2 121-130 epitope. In these mice, intravenous injection of the VP2 peptide one day before virus infection completely eliminates the immunodominant T-cell response (Johnson et al., 2001) . Elimination of the response does not cause a signiWcant increase in viral titer. There is no change in the overall pattern of infection: by 45 days virus is primarily localized to the white matter of the spinal cord, there is no signiWcant increase in inXammation, and demyelination is similar in extent to control animals. Elimination of the response did, however, signiWcantly preserve motor function in infected animals. At 45 days after infection, VP2 peptide treated animals performed signiWcantly better than control animals in tests of motor ability, although not as well as uninfected animals. These results suggest that the CD8 \u00fe T cells that mediate neurologic dysfunction are most likely the TMEV-speciWc cells that inWltrate the CNS following infection.",

In contrast to class-II deWcient mice, SJL mice control viral infection eVectively and can survive for over a year with persistent infection and chronic demyelinating disease. The disease in SJL mice progresses from demyelination, through mild neurologic deWcits, to profound deWcits and paralysis. Two general hypotheses have been proposed to explain the absence of remyelination in these mice (Miller et al., 1996) . First, an inhibitory local environment may be present, which prevents spontaneous repair. Local inXammation, reactive astrocytes, microglia, or damaged axons might play a role. Second, an absence of growth factors or oligodendrocyte precursor cells may prevent eYcient remyelination. Which of these mechanisms is the most important remains unclear. The absence of spontaneous remyelination in SJL mice, however, has provided an excellent experimental system for the study of ways to enhance the remyelination process, and several potential therapeutic approaches have been studied and developed using this system (Asakura et al., 1998; Drescher et al., 1998; Njenga et al., 2000; Ure and Rodriguez, 2002; Warrington et al., 2000) .",

These proteins, which include the capsid proteins (N, M, S, and HE), the virus-speciWc RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and virus encoded proteases, play various roles in the replication and development of infectious virus. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase uses the positive-strand genomic RNA as a template to produce full-length negative-strand RNA, which in turn is used to make more positive-strand genomic RNA. Overlapping sets of 3' co-terminal subgenomic positive-strand RNAs are also produced and translated into viral gene products. The newly synthesized genomic RNA assembles with nucleocapsid (N) protein to form the helical nucleocapsid. The S, HE, and M glycoproteins are all translated on membrane bound polysomes and are co-translationally inserted into intracellular membranes. Virions begin to form when nucleocapsids bind to intracellular membranes that contain the viral M protein and virus then buds from these specialized membranes. S and HE proteins are incorporated into the virions during budding while host proteins are excluded. After budding, mature virions accumulate in large, smooth-walled vesicles that release virus when they fuse with the plasma membrane.",

Consistent with a role for CD8 \u00fe cells in virus clearance, CD8 deWcient mice show increases in viral titer, increased mortality, and an inability to eYciently clear virus after infection (Lane et al., 2000; Williamson et al., 1990) .",

Perforin-mediated cytolysis may play an essential role in the control of virus infection of astrocytes and microglia. Perforin deWcient mice are able to clear MHV from the CNS but the clearance is delayed by several days (Lin et al., 1997b) , indicating that perforin-dependent CTL plays a role in viral clearance from the CNS. Histologic analysis has shown that virus-speciWc CTL are more eYcient at the clearance of virus from astrocytes and macrophages than from oligodendrocytes (Stohlman et al., 1995) . Ifn-g is the antiviral mechanism primarily responsible for controlling the infection of oligodendrocytes (Parra et al., 1999) . In Ifn-g deWcient mice, MHV infection results in increased neurologic disability and mortality that is associated with increased viral titers and delayed viral clearance. The anti-viral antibody response and the CTL response are not aVected. Increases of viral antigen in Ifn-g deWcient mice are located almost exclusively in oligodendrocytes and are accompanied by increased numbers of CD8 \u00fe cells in CNS white matter. CD8 \u00fe cells are therefore major participants in MHV clearance and employ at least two diVerent eVectors mechanisms to clear virus from diVerent types of infected cells. Some studies have also suggested that the Fas-Fas ligand system may play a role (Parra et al., 2000) .",

However, it seems clear that an immune component is essential for the full development of demyelinating disease. JHM-MHV infection of severe combined immunodeWciency (SCID) mice, which lack T lymphocytes, does not result in either demyelination or paralysis (Houtman and Fleming, 1996) . Similarly, mice deWcient in recombinase-activating gene (RAG) activity lack both Band T-cell function and do not develop demyelination after MHV infection (Wu and Perlman, 1999) . Infected RAG mice, whose immune system has been reconstituted by the adoptive transfer of spleen cells from genetically identical immunocompetent mice that have been immunized for MHV, developed demyelination within 7 to 9 days after transfer.

In contrast to the TMEV model, where neurologic deWcits tend to occur well after primary demyelination is established, most studies have shown that MHV induced paralysis and demyelination occur almost simultaneously, indicating that axonal damage occurs early in disease. In the experiments described earlier, animals that lack T cells, such as RAG and SCID mice, do not develop demyelination, but reconstitution of these animals by the adoptive transfer of spleen cells results in demyelination by 7 days post-transfer. Axonal damage appears with exactly the same pattern following MHV infection in these mice (Dandekar et al., 2001) . Using the appearance of nonphosphorylated neuroWlament as a marker for axonal damage, the onset of axonal damage was shown to be coincident with the appearance of demyelination. Damaged axons were detected not only at sites of active demyelination but also in areas with heavy macrophage inWltration but no obvious demyelination. Axonal damage therefore occurs very early in the disease process and nonspeciWc inXammation may play a key role.",
