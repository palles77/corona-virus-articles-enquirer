The microarray, a powerful tool in this omics era providing new opportunities to researchers, has been the major impetus behind this remarkable transformation. There is a brain-teasing structural diversity to glycans and they are bound to proteins in a variety of complex ways (1) . The glycans are subjected to regulation by more complex structural guidelines (branching events, stereoisomerism and linkage forms) than DNA or proteins. For a given reducing hexasaccharide, the number of possible structural isomers is 1.05\u00b410 12 , for a hexapeptide, 4096 and for a hexanucleotide, 6.4 \u00b410 7 (2) . In order to drive the molecular engine of various processes (Fig. 2) , protein-carbohydrate interactions provide fuel. A recent example of new microarray technology, the carbochip, provided a much better solution for the systematic and high-throughput elucidation of this specific kind of interaction. This new powerful tool has opened the gateway to a knowledge bank which was closed until now. Glycobiology is an umbrella term covering a plethora of areas. According to Dale Cumming of GlycoDesign Inc. (Canada), it is \"a bit like the proverbial onion where one goes through one layer and discovers that there are whole new layers of complexity to be addressed\". The integration of various mass spectrometry-founded approaches to carbochip technologies has illuminated the dark corners of glycobiology.",

The structure and composition of glycans are guided by sophisticated batteries of biosynthetic enzymes operating principally within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi complex or the plasma membrane and this is the reason why unveiling the enigma of carbohydrate biobuilders is an extremely daunting task.

The present situation is similar to standing in front of the tree of glycoknowledge and only being able to pluck the fruits from lower branches. To be able to reach out to the top branches, one needs a taller and stronger ladder of carbochips. The ancient biobuilder, glycan, continues to pose a bigger challenge than DNA or proteins. It does not follow the standard molecular protocol of central dogma (DNA \u00ae mRNA \u00ae protein) and this is the reason why well-documented and user-friendly molecular biology techniques like cloning, sequencing, PCR amplification, and expression strategies cannot be employed with these molecules.

            "text": "Large carbohydrate library For broad range characterization and to realise the full potential of this new tool, it is crucial to establish a high-quality storehouse of carbohydrate biobuilders. However, generating a large-scale combinatorial carbohydrate library is a very difficult task, associated with a variety of problematic issues. Using conventional chromatographic techniques such as ion exchange chromatography, the purification of stereoisomers is difficult and blood-derived samples are usually associated with problems such as rapid degradation and erythrocyte agglutination. Since the efficiency of immobilization on a surface is directly proportional to the molecular mass of the biomolecules, only oligosaccaride and polysaccharide preparations can be used. The first carbochip approach by Wang et al. (3) was much more feasible for polysaccharide preparations, which were covered by nitrocellulose-coated glass slides. Using the same approach, Wang et al. (4) raised the FIG. 2. One fuel for several molecular engines. Schematic representation of various biological processes governed by carbohydrate molecules: 1, energy and metabolism. Perplexities of the sugar structure morphology reveal how sugars store energy. Carbohydrate-modifying enzymes generate energy and synthesize large molecular weight storage molecules (e.g., glycogen). 2, Physical barriers. Considered as weapons against external physical stresses (e.g., freezing) and biochemical attacks (e.g., proteases) (29). 3, Cell-cell recognition. Modulates various processes such as adhesion, activation, migration and cell to cell signaling which bears fruit in terms of fertilization, development, differentiation, transformation, apoptosis and immune response (e.g., wounded tissue stimulates endothelial cells to express selectins for the recruitment of white blood cells). 4, Protein integrity. Involved in protein folding, 3D structure maintenance and trafficking of proteins (e.g., glycosylation assists by forming a tag for protein targeting). 5, Host-pathogen interaction. Pathogenic aliens mimic various glycans which are usually located on the outer surface of cellular communities and thus they take advantage of this to cause infection and pathogenesis (e.g., Helicobactor pylori).",

            "text": "To overcome these problems, the laboratory synthesis of sugars was attempted. However, it is currently impractical to synthesize the full complement of known sequences in animals such as Oand N-glycans of glycoproteins, diverse sequences of glycolipids and glycosaminoglycans (6) . Terminal saccharide units are initially recognized by proteins, but it is very difficult to maintain the closed ring structure and the anomericity (e.g., a and b anomeric configurations) of terminal saccharide units during chemical synthesis. Mizuno et al. (7) postulated that immobilization of the glycosyl amino acids allowed the preparation of glycochips that maintained the whole structure of the oligosaccharide. There are branched chain structures in many carbohydrates. The cluster effect (mass affinity due to multivalency) is another significant issue during solid-phase synthesis. Simultaneous multiple selective protection, deprotection and maintaining the blocking efficiency at each step is a prerequisite for the multivalent morphology of sugar structures. This mass affinity is the major obstruction for correct spacing, correct orientation and uniform densities of the fabricated sugar frameworks. It can be considered as a huge barrier to the regular and homogeneous microenvironment that results in lower biological activity and low solvent accessibility of the arrayed samples. High cost and the limited availability of enzymes (e.g., galactosyltransferase) is commonly associated with the enzymatic synthesis of glycan molecules and until now no one has developed a highly efficient genetically modified biological system for the production of carbohydrate molecules. Fazio et al. (8) implemented the cycloaddition reactions between azides and alkynes. They used carbohydrate arrays to study known inhibitors of the fucosyltransferase (FucT) enzyme, whereas Bryan et al. The carbohydrate synthesis/protein expression core of the consortium for functional glycomics (CFG) recently generated a tool box of over 75 compounds covering a broad range of structures from simple monosaccharides to decasaccharides. Clumsy nomenclature and difficult structure predictions also impede the characterization of these molecules. For structural analysis, chromatography and mass spectrometry are more often used in combination. The analytical glycotechnology core of the CFG is focusing on the development and application of ultra-high sensitivity mass spectrometric strategies for the characterization of glycoproteins, which will also allow the identification of isomers that have the same molecular weight but different structures. To avoid the confusion of nomenclature, Glycominds generated a syntax that describes the branched structures of glycans as linear computer-friendly mathematical formulae (10) .",

With the evolution of technologies, more sensitive, accurate, cost-effective and rapid automated equipment may be available in future. The array will be highly reproducible (plate to plate, well to well and batch to batch reproducibility), stable and it will be possible to dry-store it for several months. Novel surface slides generated by Willats et al. (16) were stored for three months at room temperature. The array protocol conducted by Schwarz et al. (17) was much more reproducible. Su et al. (18) also followed the same strategy and demonstrated the presence of an alpha-anomeric glycosidic linkage contributing to the high-affinity binding of cognate oligosaccharide ligands. Nimrichter et al. (19) followed the same strategy and extended the applicability of glycan microarrays to detect and quantify the specific adhesion of intact cells to covalent carbohydrate microarrays engineered on glass slides. By this methodology, carbohydrate specificity could be screened on primary cells without purifying and expressing the relevant lectin(s). This indicates that both protein-carbohydrate and carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions are amenable to cell-based microarray studies. Up-to-date fabrication strategies and modern printing methods will need to be developed very soon because it is a major shortcoming to maintain the printing load (higher printing load rapidly degrades the saccharide molecules). It is also strategic to formulate suitable software for data normalization. For the detection strategies, the critical point is how precisely weak interactions can be determined and this is the major reason why current techniques are giving low quantitative performances. Lectin-sugar interactions are relatively weaker when compared with antigen-antibody interactions (20) . Adams et al. (21) demonstrated the potential of carbohydrate microarray analysis by probing the carbohydrate affinity and structural requirements of four well-known and relevant glycoprotein 120 (gp120) binding proteins, and scytovirin, a novel HIV-inactivating protein. Such studies provide vital information for designing vaccines that give immune responses to HIV infection.",

Comparative analysis with the control spots (positive and negative) and calibration spots produce accurate signal quantification. (b) Comparative analysis of saccharides. In the realm of pathological and morphological studies, different isolates for particular saccharides can be compared with the help of labeled binding partners. These primary arrays are further subjected to cross-matched analysis for comparison.
