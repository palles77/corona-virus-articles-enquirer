Furthermore, small glycopeptides derived from egg ZP3 retain full sperm receptor activity, suggesting a role for carbohydrate, rather than polypeptide chain in receptor function. Here, we report that removal of O-linked oligosaccharides from ZP3 destroys its sperm receptor activity, whereas removal of N-linked oligosaccharides has no effect. A specific size class of O-linked oligosaccharides, recovered following mild alkaline hydrolysis and reduction of ZP3, is shown to possess sperm receptor activity and to bind to sperm. The results presented strongly suggest that mouse sperm bind to eggs via O-linked oligosaccharides present on ZP3.",

In the mouse, this coat is about 7 pm thick and consists of three different glycoproteins, ZPl, ZP2, and ZP3, that are coordinately synthesized and secreted by growing oocytes (Bleil and Wassarman, 1980b, 198Oc; Greve et al., 1982; Salzmann et al., 1983; Roller and Wassarman, 1983, Shimizu et al., 1983; Wassarman et al., 1984a; Greve and Wassarman, 1985) . To penetrate the zona pellucida, sperm first bind to its outer margin. Subsequently, a secretory response, the acrosome reaction, is triggered, enabling passage of sperm through the extracellular coat. Finally, sperm contact and fuse with the egg's plasma membrane (Gwatkin, 1977; Saling and Storey, 1979; Wassarman and Bleil, 1982; Florman and Storey, 1982; Bleil and Wassarman, 1983; .",

Previously, we demonstrated that only ZP3 exhibits sperm receptor activity in an in vitro competition assay, and it accounts for virtually all sperm receptor activity present in egg zonae pellucidae (Bleil and Wassarman, 1980a) . Furthermore, we found that even relatively small glycopeptides (1.5-6 kd) derived from ZP3, following extensive Pronase digestion, exhibit full sperm receptor activity in vitro (Florman et al., 1984) . These and other observations (Wassarman et al., 1984b) suggest that the sperm receptor activity of egg ZP3 is dependent on its carbohydrate components rather than on polypeptide chain. To demonstrate this directly, and to identify the class of oligosaccharides involved, the experiments described here were carried out. In these experiments, a competition assay (Bleil and Wassarman, 1980a; Florman et al., 1984) was used to determine the ability of oligosaccharides, derived from either solubilized zonae pellucidae or purified zona pellucida glycoproteins, to inhibit the binding of sperm to eggs in vitro (\"sperm receptor activity\").",

Following extensive digestion, both ZP2 and ZP3 migrated as broad bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, with their apparent molecular weights decreased by about 40 kd and 30 kd, respectively, as the result of Endo F treatment ( Figure 1 ). As expected, the apparent molecular weights of Endo F-treated ZP2 and ZP3 were higher than those of their polypeptide chains (81 kd and 44 kd, respectively; Greve et al., 1982; Salzmann et al., 1983) zonae pellucidae, when tested by the in vitro competition assay; similarly, Endo F-treated egg zonae pellucidae retained full receptor activity (Table 1) . It was noted that neither Endo F treated ZP3 nor Endo F treated zonae pellucidae affected the fraction of motile sperm present in these experiments. Similarly, based simply on microscopic examination, the speed and patterns of movement of the sperm used in these experiments were apparently unaffected. Furthermore, BSA, hCG, ZP2, and embryo zonae pellucidae, all of which lack any sperm receptor activity, continued to lack activity following treatment with Endo F (data not shown). Finally, sequential digestion of egg zonae pellucidae with Endo F and Pronase had no effect on sperm receptor activity, minimizing the possibility that a peptide domain possessing sperm receptor activity is rendered resistant to proteolysis by the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides (Olden et al., 1982) .

Following alkaline hydrolysis, zona pellucida solutions were neutralized, were radioiodinated, and were subjected to SDS-PAGE, as described in Experimental Procedures. We found that concentrations of NaOH typically used in p-elimination reactions (50-100 mM) resulted in extensive degradation of the polypeptide chains of ZP2 and ZP3 under the conditions described here (data not shown). However, based on SDS-PAGE, 5 mM NaOH had the desired effect on ZP2 and ZP3, reducing their molecular weights by less than 10 kd (Figure 2 ), whereas 0.5 mM and lower concentrations of NaOH did not have a detectable effect on the molecular weights of ZP2 and ZP3. When zonae pellucidae were radiolabeled prior to treatment with 5 mM NaOH, 75-90% of the radiolabel initially associated with ZP2 and ZP3 was recovered in the lower molecular weight forms of the glycoproteins; the loss of radiolabel probably reflects alkali catalyzed release of '251, although the possibility of a low level of peptide hydrolysis has not been completely eliminated. Finally, it was noted that ZPl largely disappeared following exposure to 5 mM NaOH ( Figure 2 ). We attribute this apparent loss to alkali-catalyzed reduction of the intermolecular disulfide bond of ZPl (Putnam, 1954) resulting in formation of a species that comigrates with Egg zonae pellucidae were solubilized, were lyophilized, were resuspended in either 5 mM NaOH or distilled water, and were incubated for 16 hr at 37oC as described in Experimental Procedures.

In view of the molecular weight shifts of ZP2 and ZP3 following 5 mM NaOH treatment, we determined whether or not serine and threonine were converted into alanine and a-aminobutyric acid under these conditions. Purified egg ZP2 and ZP3 were incubated in the presence of 5 mM NaOH and 1 M 3H-NaBH, at 37% for 16 hr (mild alkaline reduction), were acid hydrolyzed, and were subjected to two-dimensional thin layer chromatography as described in Experimental Procedures. Incorporation of 3H into alanine and a-aminobutyric acid was compared using zona pellucida glycoproteins exposed to 3H-NaBH, in both the presence and absence of alkali. As a control glycoprotein, hCG was treated and was analyzed under identical experimental conditions. Results of the analyses described above were expressed as incorporation ratios (cpm(N,OH)/cpm(H,OJ) for alanine, for a-aminobutyric acid, and for other amino acids. In the case of hCG, incorporation ratios of 2.19 and 0.93 were determined for alanine and a-aminobutyric acid, respectively, indicating the presence of serine-, but not threonine-linked oligosaccharides. This result is in agreement with reports that hCG is 0-glycosylated only at serine residues (Kessler et al., 1979b) . The average incorporation ratio for all other amino acids examined was 1.02 it 0.23, indicating that no other amino acids in hCG were radiolabeled in an alkali-specific manner. Incorporation ratios for purified ZP2 and ZP3 are presented in Table 2 . For both ZP2 and ZP3, ratios significantly greater than 1.0 were determined for alanine and for a-aminobutyric acid, but not for other amino acids. These results strongly suggest that both of these glycoproteins possess serine-and threonine-linked oligosaccharides that are released on mild alkaline hydrolysis.

            "text": "Carbohydrates conjugated to the /3-hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine (O-linked) were first reported for bacterial enzymes (Hanafusa et al., 1955) and were later shown to be constituents of mammalian mucins and proteoglycans (Anderson et al., 1964; Bhavanandan et al., 1964; Harbon et al., 1964; Tanaka et al., 1964) . To date, these glycoconjugates have been found on a large variety of both membrane-associated and secretory proteins (Sharon, 1975; Marshall, 1979; Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1980) . O-linked oligosaccharides are structurally diverse, consisting of linear to highly branched chains of 2 to 20 sugars that are added after translation to nascent polypeptide chains by stepwise transfer of monosaccharides (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1980; Hanover and Lennarz, 1981; Schachter and Williams, 1982) . Studies of the functional significance of O-linked oligosaccharides have been severely hindered by the lack of any specific metabolic inhibitors of this type of glycosylation. However, evidence that O-linked carbohydrates may be involved in antifreeze glycoprotein function (Vanderheede et al., 1972) , in protection of mucins against proteolysis (Allen, 1983) , in platelet adhesion (Judson et al., 1982; Tsuji et al., 1983) , and in hemagglutination by Vaccinia virus (Shida and Dales, 1981) has been presented Several observations suggest that O-linked oligosaccharides are present on the mouse egg's sperm receptor, ZP3. First, ZP3 exhibits both heterogeneity with respect to isoelectric point, and it exhibits a molecular weight higher than that of its polypeptide chain, following either removal of N-linked oligosaccharides with Endo F or inhibition of N-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin (Roller and Wassarman, 1983; Salzmann et al., 1983) . Second, mild alkaline hydrolysis of ZP3, in the absence of NaBH,, results in a slight decrease of its molecular weight (Figure 2 ). In the presence of NaBH,, serine and threonine residues are converted to alanine and to a-aminobutyric acid, respectively (Table 2) , and release of N-acetyl-D-galactosaminitol is observed (Figure 7) . Third, treatment of ZP3 with either TFMS or with mild alkali (Figure 2) but not with Endo F (Table 1 ) or with Pronase (Florman et al., 1984) , results in a loss of its sperm receptor activity. Finally, following mild alkaline hydrolysis of ZP3, in the presence of NaBH,, sperm receptor activity is found associated with released oligosaccharides having N-acetyl-o-galactosaminitol at the reducing terminus ( Figure 4, Figure 6 , and Figure 7) ; strong evidence for the presence of O-linked oligosaccharides, since N-linked oligosaccharides do not contain N-acetyl-p-galactosamine (Sharon, 1975; Marshall, 1979) . Therefore, ZP3 apparently resembles secretory proteins such as hCG (Kessler et al., 1979a (Kessler et al., , 1979b and fetuin (Spiro and Bhoyroo, 1974 ) membrane proteins such as glycophorin (Thomas and Winzler, 1969; Marchesi et al., 1976 ), LDL receptor (Cummings et al., 1983 and several viral coat proteins (Niemann et al., 1982; Johnson and Spear, 1983) in that it possesses both N- (Roller and Wassarman, 1983; Salzmann et al., 1983) and O-linked oligosaccharides.",

This appears to be a direct effect on the adhesion process, since small glycopeptides derived from ZP3 do not trigger the acrosome reaction in vitro (Florman et al., 1984) . Moreover, the same size class of ZP3 O-linked oligosaccharides (-3.9 kd apparent molecular weight) that inhibits binding of sperm to eggs, also binds preferentially to sperm ( Figure  6 ); no particular size class of ZP2 oligosaccharides displays such a preference ( Figure 5) . These, as well as other observations presented here (Figure 2 and Table 1 ) and elsewhere (Bleil and Wassarman, 1980a; Florman et al., 1984; Wassarman et al., 1984b Wassarman et al., , 1985 , strongly suggest that mouse sperm recognize and bind to eggs via O-linked oligosaccharides present on ZP3. In particular, such a situation explains the unusual stability of the sperm receptor activity of ZP3 following exposure of the glycoprotein to extremes of temperature, denaturants, or detergents (Bleil and Wassarman, 1980a; Florman and Wassarman, 1983 ); a property characteristic of a number of other putative receptors (Bleil and Wassarman, 1980a) .",

            "text": "It has been suggested previously that carbohydrate plays a role in binding sperm to zonae pellucidae, since various lectins, monosaccharides, and glycoconjugates inhibit the binding of sperm to mammalian eggs (Ahuja, 1982; Oikawa et al., 1973; Huang et al., 1982; Shur and Hall, 1982; Wassarman et al., 1984b) . Similarly, it has been reported that various monosaccharides and polysaccharides inhibit sperm-egg interaction in several in-vertebrate and plant species (Bolwell et al., 1979 (Bolwell et al., , 1980 Rosati and De Santis, 1980; Glabe et al., 1982; Barnum and Brown, 1983) . In sea urchins, such observations are particularly relevant, since several lines of evidence suggest that gamete adhesion is mediated by \"bindin\", a lectin-like sperm protein associated with acrosomes, and by a carbohydrate containing sperm receptor in the egg's vitelline envelope (Vacquier and Moy, 1977; Glabe and Vacquier, 1978; Glabe, 1979; Glabe and Lennarz, 1979, 1981; Glabe et al., 1982; Rossignol and Lennarz, 1983; Rossignol et al., 1984) . In the case of one species of sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, galactosamine has been detected in glycoconjugates, which are derived from vitelline envelopes (Rossignol et al., 1984) having sperm receptor activity. This suggests possible structural analogies with the mouse egg's sperm receptor. In the mouse, it remains to be determined whether or not O-linked oligosaccharides on ZP3 are recognized by a lectin-like protein, analogous to bindin, on sperm. Should such a protein be present, it would have to be located on plasma membrane overlying the sperm head, rather than on the acrosomal membrane, since only sperm that have not undergone the acrosome reaction bind to mouse eggs (Saling and Storey, 1979; Florman and Storey, 1982; Bleil and Wassarman, 1983) .",

            "text": "The mouse egg's sperm receptor plays a multifaceted role in the regulation of fertilization. In addition to mediating binding of sperm to eggs, ZP3 induces bound sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction (Bleil and Wassarman, 1983; Florman et al., 1984; Wassarman et al., 1985) and participates in the secondary block to polyspermy (Wolf, 1981; Schmell et al., 1983; Wassarman et al., 1984b) . The latter apparently involves modification of ZP3 following fertilization, such that it no longer possesses sperm receptor activity Wassarman, 1980a, 1983) . In sea urchins, it has been suggested that proteases, originating from the egg's cortical granules, release sperm receptors from the vitelline envelope following fertilization (Vacquier et al., 1972 (Vacquier et al., , 1973 Glabe and Vacquier, 1978) . Since ZP3 purified from 2-cell embryo zonae pellucidae, as well as glycopeptides derived from embryo ZP3, do not possess receptor activity, it would appear that ZP3 throughout the zona pellucida is modified following fertilization. Although ZP2 does undergo limited proteolysis following either fertilization or parthenogenetic activation (Bleil et al., 1981) there is no evidence as yet for proteolysis of ZP3 (Bleil and Wassarman, 1980a; Bleil et al., 1981) . Whatever the nature of the modification, it is subtle, not rendering embryo ZP3 distinguishable from egg ZP3 by conventional electrophoretic analysis (Bleil and Wassarman, 1980a; f? Wassarman, unpublished results) . We suggest that modification of the O-linked oligosaccharides described here, by a specific cortical granule glycosidase, could account for inactivation of ZP3 following either fertilization or parthenogenetic activation. Detailed characterization of O-linked oligosaccharides derived from both egg and embryo ZP3, as well as characterization of cortical granule glycosidases, will be necessary to resolve this issue.",

Fertilization of zona pellucidafree eggs by heterologous sperm in vitro is quite common, whereas hybrid fertilization of zona pellucida-intact eggs is rare (Adams, 1974; Yanagimachi, 1981 Yanagimachi, , 1984 Barros and Leal, 1980; Gulyas and Schmell, 1981) . The question of whether or not the O-linked oligosaccharides derived from ZP3 inhibit sperm binding in a species-specific manner has not been addressed in this investigation. In this connection, it has been demonstrated that, although sperm receptor activity is associated with glycopeptides derived from sea urchin vitelline envelopes, the glycopeptides do not exhibit the species specificity observed with high molecular weight, vitelline envelope glycoconjugates (Kinsey and Lennarz, 1981; Rossignol et al., 1983; Glabe and Lennarz, 1981) . It will certainly be of interest to compare the structure of the ZP3 O-linked oligosaccharides described here with functionally analogous oligosaccharides from other mammalian species.",
