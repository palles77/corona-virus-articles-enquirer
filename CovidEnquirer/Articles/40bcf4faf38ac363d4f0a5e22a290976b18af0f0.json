Most of the knowledge about the pathogenesis of MS has been derived from murine models, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and viral encephalomyelitis. Here, we infected female C57BL/6 mice with a neurotropic strain of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-59A) to evaluate whether treatment with the multifunctional antioxidant tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) affects the ensuing encephalomyelitis. In untreated animals, neurological symptoms developed quickly: 90% of infected mice died 10 days after virus inoculation and the few survivors presented neurological deficits. Treatment with tempol (24 mg/kg, ip, two doses on the first day and daily doses for 7 days plus 2 mM tempol in the drinking water ad libitum) profoundly altered the disease outcome: neurological symptoms were attenuated, mouse survival increased up to 70%, and half of the survivors behaved as normal mice. Not surprisingly, tempol substantially preserved the integrity of the CNS, including the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, treatment with tempol decreased CNS viral titers, macrophage and T lymphocyte infiltration, and levels of markers of inflammation, such as expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, transcription of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3, and protein nitration. The results indicate that tempol ameliorates murine viral encephalomyelitis by altering the redox status of the infectious environment that contributes to an attenuated CNS inflammatory response. Overall, our study supports the development of therapeutic strategies based on nitroxides to manage neuroinflammatory diseases, including MS.",

With an incidence of 1 per 1000 individuals, MS is the most prominent chronic neurological disease of young adults in the moderate climate areas of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres [1] . While there is a clear genetic influence [2, 3] , complex diseases such as MS are likely to involve inherited arrays of genetic polymorphisms, each exerting a slight effect on disease establishment and progression [4] . Environmental factors are also recognized as contributors to MS. Although the view that infectious agents encountered early in life may prime or trigger the disease process that manifests later in life is widely supported, incontrovertible evidence for a direct viral or bacterial trigger of MS has yet to be provided [1, [5] [6] [7] . Because of the relative inaccessibility and sensitivity of the human central nervous system (CNS), most of the knowledge about the pathogenesis of MS has been derived from experimental animal models, such as murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and murine viral encephalomyelitis [1, [6] [7] [8] .",

The resulting inflammatory environment favors high rates of superoxide anion and nitric oxide formation through NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), respectively [9] [10] [11] . These primary radicals lead to species that are more reactive toward biomolecules, such as peroxynitrite, nitrogen dioxide, carbonate radical, and myeloperoxidase compound I. They, in turn, may propagate the inflammatory cascade and/or trigger degenerative cascades leading to nitrooxidative damage of the neural tissue [9] [10] [11] . Accordingly, the presence of 3-nitrotyrosine residues in proteins, a marker of nitrooxidative damage, has been consistently demonstrated in acute and chronic active MS lesions of animal models and human patients (see, for instance [8, [12] [13] [14] ).",

Under physiological conditions, the nitroxide tempol (TPNO \u2022 ) acts as a multifunctional antioxidant because it reacts with diverse biological oxidants and reductants while being recycled through the oxammonium cation (TPNO + ) and hydroxylamine derivative (TPNOH), respectively. After several catalytic cycles, tempol is eventually consumed by recombination reactions with specific radicals, such as tyrosyl and thiyl radicals and/or metabolized [15, 19, 21, 23] .

Briefly, a television camera from the microscope acquired the image. The fields were selected within the brain regions of cortical areas, amygdaloid nuclei, hippocampus, and corpus callosum, bilaterally. The size of the sampled fields was 8.96 \u00d7 10 4 \u03bcm 2 (40\u00d7) for cortical areas, amygdaloid nuclei, and hippocampus and 1.21 \u00d7 10 4 \u03bcm 2 (63\u00d7) for corpus callosum. After shading correction, the following discrimination procedure was performed. The mean value of the gray matter (MGV \u00b1 standard error) in areas of the brain devoid of specific labeling was taken as the background. Gray values darker than the background were considered to correspond to specific labeling and discriminated. The specific MGV was taken as the difference between the specific and the background values. The glass value was left constant at 200 MGV. The morphometric (area) and the microdensitometric measurements (specific MGV) indicate the amount of immunopositive profiles in the sampled fields. Only the area of immunolabeling was presented.",

Thus, we started by examining the characteristics of the MHV-59A infection in our experimental settings. SPF female C57BL/6 mice (n = 12) received PBS (ip) as a surrogate for the ulterior tempol treatment and intracranial inoculation of MHV-59A (500 pfu) and were maintained under observation. One day after infection, 50% of the animals showed mild neurological symptoms, such as piloerection, hunched posture, and lethargy (score 1) (Fig. 1A) . Between 2 and 4 days after inoculation, some mice improved, but at least 70% showed moderate to severe neurological symptoms, such as hind-or fore-limb weakness/paresis (score 2) or hind-or fore-limb paralysis and ataxic gait (score 3). Between 6 and 8 days after infection, 30% of the mice died. Ten days after inoculation, 90% of the mice had died, and the survivors still presented neurological symptoms that persisted up to 60 days (Fig. 1A) . Histopathological analysis of brain tissues collected 7 days after inoculation showed massive inflammatory cellular infiltration throughout forebrain gray and white matter regions (Fig. 1B) . Inflammatory foci that were accumulating increased amounts of infiltrating cells were evident in gray matter regions, such as neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and diencephalon, and also in white matter structures, such as the lateral regions of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, anterior commissure, and fornix. Moreover, perivenous cuffing was particularly seen in the white matter clusters, mainly associated with perivenular disruption of the myelin staining by Weil (Fig. 1B) . Thus, we confirmed that MHV-A59 infection of SPF female C57BL/6 mice models certain of the aspects of the CNS inflammation associated with MS [5] [6] [7] , being useful to test the effects of tempol treatment.",

As is usual in biological fluids and tissues, most of the tempol was present in its reduced form, the corresponding hydroxylamine. Indeed, the characteristic EPR signal of tempol became noticeable upon addition of ferricyanide to the homogenates [29] . Total tempol (nitroxide plus hydroxylamine) levels decayed quickly in vivo, attaining about 0.3 \u03bcM in brain 25 min after administration. Maximum levels (about 15 \u03bcM) were measured 10 min after administration in sham mice. The lower levels of total tempol detected in infected mice (about 3 \u03bcM after 10 min) are consistent with the course of infection producing radicals that are able to react with tempol to generate redox inactive products [29] .",

For example, the neurological symptoms and CNS infiltration and demyelination were greatly reduced (Fig. 3) , and mouse survival was significantly increased (Fig. 4) . Indeed, histopathological analysis of the forebrain regions of tempol-treated mice revealed a dramatic reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration throughout the forebrain gray and white matter regions. In addition, perivenous accumulation of inflammatory cells and disruption of the Weil's myelin stain were substantially reduced (compare Figs. 1B and 3B). Whereas 90% of untreated mice died at 10 days after infection, 70% of the mice treated with tempol survived (Fig. 4) and about half of them displayed the behavior of normal mice (Fig. 3A) . These striking effects were obtained with tempol administration (24 mg/kg; ip) in two doses on the first day (5 min before and 2 h after MHV-A59 inoculation) and in daily doses for 7 days; the animals also received tempol (2 mM) in the drinking water ad libitum [29] . No adverse effects of this treatment were observed in uninfected mice (Fig. 4) . Previously, we have shown that tempol administered in the drinking water was distributed to tissues but we did not examine CNS tissues [29] . Now, we determined the levels of total tempol (tempol plus hydroxylamine) in the brain, spinal cord, and plasma of mice receiving 2 mM tempol in the drinking water. These levels were similar and around 0.3 \u03bcM (data not shown).",

Thus, we complemented the histopathological analysis of CNS tissues of MHV59A-infected mice (Figs. 1B and 3B) with immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analysis of markers of inflammation. Immunohistochemical analysis of the brain (Fig. 6 ) and spinal cord (data not shown) tissues showed that viral infection resulted in macrophage infiltration, iNOS expression, and protein nitration, all of which were greatly attenuated by tempol treatment. In some brain sections of infected mice, activated glial cells strongly staining for nitrated proteins were noticeable (Fig. 6, bottom left) . Semiquantitative image analysis of the immunostaining of the brain tissues revealed that treatment with tempol reduced macrophage infiltration, iNOS expression, and 3nitrotyrosine levels to about 4, 26, and 16% of those of untreated mice, respectively (Fig. 7A) . Quantification of 3-nitrotyrosine levels in the spinal cords of the animals by immune slot blot confirmed that tempol inhibited its levels to about 12% of those of untreated mice (Fig. 7B) . Treatment with tempol also greatly reduced the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 mRNAs in the spinal cords of the animals as assessed by RT-PCR (Fig. 7C) . These cytokines can be produced by T cells, which are involved in the immune and inflammatory response during viral encephalomyelitis [reviewed in 6, 7] . Thus, we also quantified the levels of CD4 and CD8 mRNA in the spinal cords and spleens of the animals. Treatment with tempol decreased the infiltration of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes into the spinal cords, although only the differences in CD8 mRNA levels were statistically significant (Figs. 8A and 8C). Tempol did not alter the levels of CD4 and CD8 transcripts in the spleen (Fig. 8A) , indicating a preserved immune status of the treated animals. Naive mice presented lower levels of CD4 and CD8 transcripts (Fig. 8B ) than infected animals (Fig. 8A) , as can be inferred from the relative intensity of the corresponding CD4, CD8, and \u03b2-actin bands. These results demonstrate that tempol strongly inhibited the CNS inflammation of MHV-59A-infected mice (Figs.1, 3, 6, and 7) without compromising their immune system (Fig. 8 ).",

Treatment with tempol attenuated these neurological symptoms and increased survival up to 70% (Figs. 3A and 4) . Notably, half of the survivors behaved as normal mice, at least when kept at a low dose of tempol in the drinking water (2 mM).

Systemic T cells did not decrease, excluding a major immunosuppressive effect of tempol ( Fig. 8 ) [40] . Treatment with tempol also reduced the tissue levels of markers of inflammation, such as expression of iNOS, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 transcription, and protein nitration (Figs. 6 and 7). In these animals, the inhibition of protein nitration (about 86%) was higher than that of iNOS expression (about 74%; Figs. 7A and B), indicating that tempol is acting as both an antioxidant and a regulator of iNOS expression [29] . The antioxidant action of tempol during the MHV-59A virusinduced encephalomyelitis was also revealed by the faster decay rate of tempol plus hydroxylamine in the brains of infected mice compared with sham mice (Fig. 2) . This indicates that the infectious process generates a considerable amount of radicals, some of which are able to react with tempol to produce redox-inactive products [29] . Consequently, tempol altered the redox status of the infectious environment (Fig. 2) . On the other hand, it is being increasingly recognized that the redox status of extra-and intracellular microenvironments influences the outcome of infectious/inflammatory processes [41] [42] [43] . Thus, it is likely that tempol attenuated the CNS inflammatory response and ameliorated viral encephalomyelitis (Figs. 1 and 3-8) by altering the redox status of the infectious environment (Fig. 2) . In this regard, our study supports the argument that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of tempol are likely to be interrelated [29, 38, 44] .",

At the phenomenological level, tempol has been previously shown to display anti-inflammatory properties in mouse models of infectious/inflammatory diseases. For instance, tempol administration decreased the levels of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and inhibited NF-\u03baB activation in mice subjected to carrageenan-induced pleuritis [44] and inhibited iNOS expression in murine leishmaniasis [29] . In the case of the MHV-59A-infected mice, treatment with tempol reduced the levels of iNOS protein (Figs. 6 and 7) and viral load into the CNS (Table 1 ). This reduction in viral load contrasts with our previous observation that in reducing iNOS expression and protein nitration in murine leishmaniasis, tempol increases parasite load in cutaneous lesions [29] .",

In contrast with most bacteria and parasites, virus cannot be confined to limited areas by the nonspecific host defense mediated by phagocytes and their mediators. In consequence, nitric oxide-derived oxidants are more likely to cause nonspecific nitro-oxidative damage in virusinfected tissue than to eliminate the virus [47] [48] [49] . Accordingly, it has been reported that infection of iNOS knockout (\u2212/\u2212) and iNOS (+/+) mice with MHV resulted in similar kinetics of virus clearance, but in reduced neuronal apoptosis and mortality [50] . We did not follow the kinetics of virus clearance in our experimental setting, but we did show that 7 days after infection, tempol reduced viral load, iNOS expression, and CNS damage. Thus, it is feasible that by decreasing nitro-oxidative stress, tempol attenuates the mutation rate of the virus, precluding evolution of mutants able to escape the antiviral immune responses of the host [45, 46] . Additionally, tempol [41, 42] .",

Thus, our study argues for the interrelatedness of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of tempol [29, 38, 44] . This cross talk, however, remains to be examined at the molecular level. With regard to therapeutic implications, it is important to note that the natural antioxidant uric acid has been shown to be quite effective in ameliorating EAE by inhibiting CNS inflammation, BBB dysfunction, and tissue damage [8, 12, 51, 52] . This discovery motivated the initiation of clinical trials with inosine, a metabolic precursor of uric acid. Oral administration of inosine increases uric acid levels in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid, whereas an oral dose of uric acid is mostly degraded by uricase in the gastrointestinal tract. The ameliorating effects of uric acid in EAE have been attributed to its ability to scavenge nitric oxidederived oxidants [8, 12, 51, 52] . In comparison, tempol is more effective than uric acid in scavenging nitric oxide-derived oxidants [9] , displays low toxicity in animal models [15, 16] , permeates the blood-brain barrier (Fig. 2) , and inhibits the enzyme myeloperoxidase ( [20] ; see Augusto et al., [53] , which has been recently associated with MS [54, 55] . In this context, the reported ameliorating effects of tempol on viral murine encephalomyelitis provide support for the development of therapeutic strategies based on nitroxides to manage neuroinflammatory diseases, including MS.
