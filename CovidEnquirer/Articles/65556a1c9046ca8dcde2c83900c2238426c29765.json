            "text": "Background: The rapid and accurate identification of individuals who are at high risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection remains a major challenge for the medical and scientific communities. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk prediction model for the screening of suspected cases of MERS-CoV infection in patients who have developed pneumonia. Methods: A two-center, retrospective case-control study was performed. A total of 360 patients with confirmed pneumonia who were evaluated for MERS-CoV infection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) between September 1, 2012 and June 1, 2016 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh and King Fahad General Hospital in Jeddah, were included. According to the rRT-PCR results, 135 patients were positive for MERS-CoV and 225 were negative. Demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, and radiological and laboratory findings were collected for each subject. Results: A risk prediction model to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV was developed. The model included male sex, contact with a sick patient or camel, diabetes, severe illness, low white blood cell (WBC) count, low alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and high aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The model performed well in predicting MERS-CoV infection (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) 0.8162), on internal validation (AUC 0.8037), and on a goodness-of-fit test (p = 0.592). The risk prediction model, which produced an optimal probability cut-off of 0.33, had a sensitivity of 0.716 and specificity of 0.783. Conclusions: This study provides a simple, practical, and valid algorithm to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV infection. This risk prediction model could be useful for the early identification of patients at the highest risk of MERS-CoV infection. Further validation of the prediction model on a large prospective cohort of representative patients with pneumonia is necessary.",

The diagnosis of this infection remains complex (Al Johani and Hajeer, 2016; Sung et al., 2016; Ahmed, 2017a) and it has a high fatality rate (Ahmed, 2017b, c; Aleanizy et al., 2017; Sherbini et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017) . The early detection and identification of individuals at high risk of a disease is the most effective strategy to improve patient clinical outcomes (Ahmed, 2017a) and reduce the costs of testing, both physical and economic (Ahmed et al., 2011 (Ahmed et al., , 2013 . The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) has been found to be valid and accurate for the evaluation of respiratory swabs, sputum, and other endotracheal aspirate material (Corman et al., 2012a, b) . However, although rRT-PCR is the most accurate and sensitive test available at the authors' centers, absolute identification of MERS-CoV may require multiple clinical specimens from different sources and take days (Corman et al., 2012a, b; Anon, 2018a) .",

The current guidelines include fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, chronic diseases, and risk of exposure to MERS-CoV. In clinical practice, identifying high-risk individuals can be challenging, since most laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV patients report common clinical risk indices to patients with other respiratory conditions. For instance, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms are common for both MERS-CoV and non-MERS-CoV patients (Mohd et al., 2016) . Thus, further exploration must take place to reduce the risk of MERS-CoV infection. A risk prediction model is urgently needed to stratify patients with suspected MERS-CoV. This may decrease the risk of virus transmission to others who are in close contact, for example healthcare workers, patients, and hospital visitors, by allowing the careful management of those who are potentially infected at an early stage of infection. Developing a MERS-CoV prediction model may more efficiently aid physicians in identifying individuals at high risk and selecting the necessary test(s) to improve prevention and control measures.",

The risk prediction model highlights the strong potential impact of male sex, contact with a sick patient or camel, severe illness, diabetes, low WBC count, high AST, and low ALT on MERS-CoV infection. These few important parameters could be part of routine medical examinations to be performed (for the purpose of identifying highly suspected individuals) in daily clinical practice in order to make a prompt and timely clinical decision. According to the model, high AST was associated with an increased risk of being infected with MERS-CoV. This finding is similar to that of Mohd et al., who noted high AST levels in MERS-CoV patients (Mohd et al., 2016) . Unlike their findings, it was noted in the present study that the impact of ALT became significantly negative after controlling for several confounders.

In this study, 'contact with a sick patient' and 'contact with a sick camel' were combined into one variable due to the small number in each category. Severe illness was based on a subjective judgment. An additional potential limitation was that the duration of symptoms was not available for these patients. This study investigated a very specific population (pneumonia) at only two centers, which could compromise the applicability and generalizability of the risk prediction model. Moreover, the prediction model may not be generalizable to patients who do not fulfill the MOH guidelines. Further validation of the prediction model on an external sample and prospective cohort of representative patients with pneumonia is necessary, specifically in relevant settings: emergency, outpatient, inpatient, and community.",
