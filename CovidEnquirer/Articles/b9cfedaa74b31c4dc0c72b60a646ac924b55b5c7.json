            "text": "Systemic inflammation may reflect infection. Appropriate therapy includes supportive care and use of antimicrobial agents. Indeed, early initiation of antibiotics is of key importance in the management of sepsis. [1] [2] [3] However, inflammation may also arise from noninfectious causes, including pancreatitis, cardiac ischemia, bowel perforation, vasculitis, and pulmonary embolism. Current clinical practice is to initiate empiric antibiotic therapy prior to identification of an infectious agent based on treatment guidelines and knowledge of the local microbiome. 2 Unfortunately, confirmation of infection may take several days. Errors in antibiotic choice can lead to significant increases in mortality, 4 whereas overuse of antibiotics fosters bacterial resistance. 5 Therefore, a method to differentiate between inflammation due to infection and inflammation due to other causes is particularly valuable.",

It is elevated in patients with infection relative to those with noninfectious systemic inflammation, even when adjusted for severity of illness. [19] [20] [21] Ideal cutoffs for diagnosis of infection are in the range of 50-100 mg/L. 19 Sensitivity and specificity estimates vary, but a 2004 metaanalysis provided a pooled sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 67% for the diagnosis of bacterial infection relative to noninfectious inflammation. 22 In the pediatric population, ideal cutoffs are typically lower (20-40 mg/L). 22 CRP levels tend to be lower in systemic viral and fungal infections than in systemic bacterial infection. 22, 23 In the context of viral infection, interferon-a may inhibit CRP production from hepatocytes. 24 However, there is often overlap in CRP levels between patients with bacterial and nonbacterial infections, making them difficult to distinguish. A metaanalysis of CRP in community-acquired pneumonia showed widely varying sensitivity and specificity estimates 46 How Can Biomarkers Be Used to Differentiate Between Infection and Non-Infectious Causes of Inflammation? Alexandra Binnie, Joel Lage, and Claudia C. Dos Santos with significant heterogeneity. 25 Similarly, a metaanalysis of patients with fever of unknown origin failed to show utility for CRP in identifying patients with bacterial vs. nonbacterial infection. 23 However, CRP may have greater utility in distinguishing between bacterial and nonbacterial illness in the critically ill population than in the general hospital population. In a study of 16 ICU patients with H1N1 influenza and 9 ICU patients with bacterial pneumonia, CRP levels were much lower in the H1N1 population (mean, 118 mg/L vs. 363 mg/L). 26 In this study, a CRP cutoff of .200 mg/L identified patients with bacterial pneumonia with 100% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity. Similarly, a cohort study of 76 patients with presumed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) revealed average CRP levels of only 39 mg/L in this population. 27 Limited data is available for CRP in the context of fungal infection. A single-center study of immunocompromised patients showed that CRP levels were elevated in the context of invasive fungal infections (range, 112-269 mg/L), albeit to a lesser degree than in patients with bacteremia (range, 160-387 mg/L). 28 Another study of post-surgical patients at high risk of fungal infection showed that a CRP cutoff of 100 mg/L was helpful in distinguishing bacterial from fungal infection with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 53%. 29 Thus, high CRP levels favor bacterial over fungal causes of infection, but further work is required to clarify appropriate cutoffs as well as to determine sensitivity and specificity.",

[34] [35] [36] Prospective studies have generally confirmed these results; a prospective study of 151 mixed surgical patients showed that CRP .100 mg/L on POD5 had a sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 64% for infection, 33 while a separate study of 50 patients showed that CRP .130 mg/L on POD4 had a sensitivity and specificity of 80% for anastomotic leak. A large prospective study is currently underway with 500 patients, which should provide more clarity on this issue. 37",

An increase in CRP of \ue02422 mg/L in the first 48 hours of therapy was associated with ineffective antibiotic therapy with a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 67%. 39 Treating physicians were not blinded to CRP levels, so rises in CRP may have contributed to the decision to change antibiotics in some patients. A separate cohort study of 68 patients with ventilatorassociated pneumonia showed that CRP levels declined significantly within 96 hours of initiating adequate antibiotic therapy but not in patients receiving inadequate antibiotic therapy. 40 A decline of at least 20% in CRP at 96 hours had a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 87% for effective antibiotic therapy. 40 Finally, amongst hospitalized patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia, appropriate antibiotic therapy was associated with a .60% decrease in CRP by Day 3 of antibiotic therapy and .90% decrease by Day 7. 41 Thus adequate antibiotic therapy is generally associated with significant decreases in CRP by Day 3 or 4 of therapy; however, this effect may be more pronounced in non-ICU patients than in ICU patients.",

Under normal conditions, the CALC-1 gene is transcribed into PCT in the thyroid C-cells and then cleaved to form calcitonin. PCT is virtually undetectable in the serum of healthy individuals (,0.05 ng/L). 42 In the context of infection, however, CALC-1 expression is upregulated in various tissues including the neuroendocrine cells of the liver and lung, 43 adipocytes, 44 and macrophages. 45 These tissues lack the ability to cleave PCT into calcitonin, leading to a rapid rise in serum PCT levels. 42 Expression of PCT in nonthryoid tissues is stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (endotoxin) as well as inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-1. Conversely, the viral mediator interferon-g has an inhibitory effect on PCT expression. 44 However, PCT is not entirely specific to bacterial infection. Noninfectious causes of PCT elevation include neuroendocrine malignancies, such as small cell lung cancer, C-cell carcinoma of the thyroid gland, and neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. 46 Additional causes include acute illnesses such as cardiac arrest, 47 pancreatitis, 48 rhabdomyolysis, 49 and trauma. 50 Finally, PCT levels increase postoperatively, particularly in patients undergoing intestinal surgery. 51 PCT elevations in patients with noninfectious inflammation, however, are typically lower than in those with bacterial infection. 52",

A subanalysis comparing surgical and trauma patients with medical patients showed that PCT was slightly more accurate in surgical and trauma patients than in medical patients. 55 A separate metaanalysis examined PCT as a marker of bacteremia in hospitalized patients. 56 Amongst ICU patients (n 5 399), the sensitivity and specificity of PCT for bacteremia vs. noninfectious inflammation was 89% and 68%, respectively. The authors calculated the optimal PCT cutoff to be 0.5 ng/mL. Of note, the lowest sensitivity was among immunocompromised patients at only 66% (with a specificity of 78%). 56 PCT also shows good diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing bacterial from viral infection. A metaanalysis of two pediatric studies and an adult meningitis study indicated that PCT had a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 73% for diagnosing bacterial vs. viral infection (cutoff range, 0.5-5 ng/mL). 22 Studies of patients with life-threatening viral illnesses, including SARS and influenza H1N1, have also confirmed low levels of PCT in these populations. 57 A cohort study of H1N1 patients (n 5 16) documented PCT levels of 0.2-5.9 ng/mL in these patients compared with 8.2-81.5 ng/mL in a comparator group with severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (n 5 9). 26 PCT is also effective in distinguishing bacterial infections from invasive fungal infections.

In a cohort of 100 cardiac surgery patients, PCT .1.5 ng/mL on POD 3 showed a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 80% in diagnosing infectious complications, including postoperative pneumonia, mediastinitis, and bacteremia. 61 In neurosurgical patients PCT levels do not increase routinely postoperatively, whereas CRP and white blood cell counts do. 62 Serum PCT levels have not proven useful in diagnosing postoperative infections in neurosurgical patients. 63 However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PCT levels may be helpful. A case series of patients with bacterial, viral, and postneurosurgical meningitis showed that PCT .0.9 ng/mL in CSF was 93% sensitive and 67% specific for meningitis. Although the post-neurosurgical meningitis group was small, all 10 patients had CSF PCT levels .0.9 ng/mL. 64 Unfortunately, the study did not include neurosurgical patients without meningitis. A recent study from China examined 93 neurosurgical patients suspected of post-surgical infection. CSF PCT averaged 0.35 ng/mL (range, 0.13-2.74 ng/mL) in noninfected patients, whereas CSF PCT averaged 0.76 ng/mL (range, 0.24-4.67 ng/mL) in infected patients. The authors did not calculate sensitivity and specificity, but the area under the receiver operating curve for CSF PCT was 0.80 (95% confidence interval 5 0.71-0.90), and the authors recommended a cutoff of 0.425 ng/mL. 65",

Patients in the PCT group were subjected to two interventions: a PCT-guided threshold for initiation of antibiotics and a PCT-guided threshold for discontinuation of antibiotics. 66 At the onset of infectious symptoms, antibiotic initiation was encouraged for patients with PCT levels \ue0240.5 ng/mL but not below this threshold. After antibiotics were initiated, daily PCT levels were measured and discontinuation of antibiotics was encouraged if the PCT level dropped below 0.25 ng/mL or if it was ,0.5 ng/mL and at least 80% decreased from peak. 66 These two interventions resulted in a significant decrease in antibiotic usage (812 vs. 653 days of antibiotic exposure per 1000 inpatient days) without any corresponding increase in mortality or ICU length of stay. 66 A follow-up study from 15 ICUs in the Netherlands followed a similar format and again showed a reduction in antibiotic use with no increase in mortality or length of ICU stay. 67 It also demonstrated cost savings associated with fewer days of antibiotics; however, this was counterbalanced by the costs of daily PCT measurements. The authors calculated that a PCT assay cost of ,4\u20ac per sample would achieve overall cost savings in their study centers. 67 A third multicenter trial from Germany showed a more modest reduction in antibiotic usage (823 vs. 862 days of antibiotic exposure per 1000 ICU days); however, PCT testing was only performed on Days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14 of antibiotic therapy. 68 The treating physicians overruled the algorithm in .50% of cases, casting doubts on the practicality of this protocol. Once again, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of mortality or ICU length of stay. 68 Thus PCT-guided antibiotic prescribing shows promise in the reduction of unnecessary antibiotic use but may require daily PCT testing to be efficacious.",

In this chapter, we present the evidence for their use in the diagnosis of sepsis and management of antibiotic therapy in the intensive care unit context. Keywords: biomarker, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome Abstract: Diagnosis of sepsis is based on recognition of systemic inflammation and organ failure in the context of an inciting infection. Since none of the diagnostic criteria are specific to sepsis, it is easy to confound sepsis with noninfectious causes of systemic inflammation, including pancreatitis, cardiac ischemia, bowel perforation, vasculitis, and pulmonary embolism amongst others. Two widely used biomarkers, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, have proven promising",
