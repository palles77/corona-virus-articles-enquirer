According to the daily report of the National Health Commission of China, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has so far caused 57,416 confirmed cases, including 11,272 severe cases, and 1,665 deaths in China by February 15th, 2020 [1] show symptoms of fever, dry cough, fatigue, abnormal chest CT findings but with a good prognosis [2, 3] . In contrast, some patients develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure, with death rates ranging from between 4.3% to 15% according to different study reports [2, 4] .",

Therefore, we further characterized the kinetic changes of inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, in the serum of our patient cohort. Fluctuations in the serum levels of these cytokines in the mild patient group were minor. In contrast, the severe patient group showed more significant fluctuations in the serum levels of these cytokines ( Figure 3 ). All examined cytokines, except IL-6, reached their peak levels in the serum at 3-6 days after disease onset ( Figure 3 ). Both IL-6 and IL-10 levels showed sustained increases in the severe group compared to the mild group ( Figure 3A and 3B) . A decease in serum IL-6 levels in the severe group started at 16 days after disease onset, and IL-10 levels were lowest at 13 days after disease onset ( Figure 3A and 3B). Significant increases in serum IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 levels in the severe group were only observed at 4-6 days after disease onset ( Figure 3C and 3F).",

Although the majority of the patients did not have an exposure history of the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the clinical characteristics of these patients are very similar to those reported in previous studies [2, 4, 7] . The ages of severe patients are older, and the proportion of underlying diseases is higher, and co-infection also occurs in severe patients. Recent reports show that the lymphocyte counts are normal in COVID-19 patients with mild diseases. In contrast, 63%-70.3% of patients with severe diseases have lymphopenia and the lymphocyte counts in patients with a mortal outcome remain at a low level [4, 8] . Our study also confirmed higher rates of developing lymphopenia in severe patients than in mild patients (84.6% vs 44.4%). We found that the development of lymphopenia in severe patients was mainly related to the significantly decreased absolute counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, but not to B cells and NK cells. The decrease of T cells in the severe patient group reaches its peak within the first week during the disease course, and then T cell numbers gradually increase from the second week and recover to a comparable level to that of the mild patient group in the third week. All these severe patients included in our study survived the disease, and thus we speculate this course is associated with a favorable outcome in severe COVID-19 patients. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

            "text": "acute phase of SARS disease in patients[11,13]. Lymphopenia is also observed in MERS-CoV infected patients. A detailed clinical study showed that 14 % of MERS patients had leukopenia, while 34 % of the patients had lymphopenia[14].The mechanism of developing lymphopenia may differ in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. SARS-CoV cannot productively infect T cells, however,altered antigen presenting cells (APC) function and impaired dendritic cells migration during SARS-CoV infection may result in insufficient T cell priming and thus contribute to decreased numbers of virus-specific T cells in the lungs[15,16]. Moreover, delayed type I interferon response or inflammatory monocyte-macrophages derived pro-inflammatory cytokines could also sensitize T cells to undergo apoptosis[17]. In contrast, MERS-CoV was found to be able to infect many human immune cells, including dendritic cells[18], macrophages[19], and T cells[20]. MERS-CoV infection of T cells results in apoptosis mediated by a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, which is believed to contribute to virus spread and the severe immunopathology[20]. So far, it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 induced T cell contraction is the result of a direct T cell infection or an indirect effect cause by the virus, such as APC function disorder or overactive inflammatory responses. Further studies are needed to investigate the corresponding mechanisms in detail.Previous studies have shown that elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3, TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8, are associated with severe lung injury and adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection[6,18,19,21]. Our results also demonstrate that severe COVID-19 patients have higher concentrations of IL6, IL10, IL2 and IFN-\u03b3 in the serum than mild cases, suggesting that the magnitude of1 6 cytokine storm is associated with the disease severity. Additionally, T cells are important for dampening overactive innate immune responses during viral infection[22,23]. Thus, loss of T cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in aggravated inflammatory responses, while restoring T cell numbers may alleviate them. In line with this hypothesis, we observed that the kinetic changes of T cell counts are reversely correlated with the kinetic changes of most examined cytokine levels in the peripheral blood in severe COVID-19 patients. While T cell counts drop to their lowest levels at 4-6 days after disease onset, serum IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 levels reach their peaks. The courses of restoring T cell numbers are associated with decreases of serum IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 levels. Early identification of risk factors for severe COVID-19 patients may facilitate appropriate supportive care and promptly access to the intensive care unit if necessary. A recent study in a 61-patient cohort reported that the NLR was the most useful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19[24]. The severity of pathological injury during SARS or MERS correlates with the extensive infiltration of neutrophils in the lung and increased neutrophil numbers in the peripheral blood[17].Thus, the magnitude of increase in neutrophil counts may suggest the intensity of inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients. Besides, the magnitude of decrease in lymphocyte counts also indicates the extend of the impairment of immune system by the viral infection. Therefore, NLR may serve as a useful factor to reflect the intensity of imbalance of inflammation and immune responses in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we also screened the potential prognostic factors affecting incidence of severe illness in our patient cohort. Based on our findings with analyzing lymphocyte subsets, we further included the ratio of neutrophils to different lymphocyte subsets as parameters. Our kinetic analysis revealed that CD8 + T cells are the major lymphocyte subset which decreases in cell numbers during COVID-19. In line with this finding, All rights reserved.
