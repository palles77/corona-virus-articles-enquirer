Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with specificities for leukocyte subsets and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens were used to characterize IFNa producer cells. The production of IFNa was found to be a function of non-phagocytic, non-adherent, non-T, non-B, CD4 + (and to a lesser extent CD8 +) MHC-class-II-positive ceils. Furthermore, addition of anti-MHC (class II) mAb during PBMC incubation with virus-infected cells reduced IFN yields, suggesting that masking of these surface antigens alters PBMC responsiveness to IFN induction.",

            "text": "INTRODUCTION Peripheral blood leukocytes have been shown to produce interferon alpha (IFNa) upon induction by viruses, bacterial products or tumour cells (Dianzani and Capobianchi, 1987) . In contrast to IFN beta, for which the critical inducing factor appears to be viral RNA, a different mechanism seems to be involved in induction of IFNa. Thus, inactivated virus particles, virus-infected cells, mycoplasmas and cell membranes are capable of inducing IFNa (Lebon et ai., 1982; Hughes and Blalock, 1983; Goblet al., 1988; Capobianchi et al.., 1987) , which suggests that membrane interactions between the inducer structure and the leukocyte membrane is sufficient to trigger IFNa produc-tion. In the case of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a coronavirus which induces acute diarrhoea and intense IFN synthesis in newborn piglets (La Bonnardiere and Laude, 1981) , we have previously shown that early IFN~ production could result from exposure of non-immune pig lymphocytes to virus-infected cells. Moreover, experiments in which IFN0c production was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed at some epitopes of the TGEV glycoprotein E1 suggested that a defined domain of this transmembrane viral protein played a key role in the IFN0t induction process (Charley and Laurie, 1988) .",

Thus, rII22A5 mAb used as an ascitic fluid could hLhibit up to 99.9 07o IFN production at a final Ig concentration of 12 ,.6/ml ( fig. la) . MSA3 hybridoma culture supernata,~t blocked up to 99 070 IFN production at a final Ig concentration of 0.25 [~g/ml ( fig. Ib) . Three other ascitic fluids, directed at SLA class II, also showed dose-dependent iaS~hition of IFN production ( fig. 2 ). In addition, the latter blocking experiment was achieved by pretreatment of PBMC with mAb, followed by washing of cells before induction on TGEV-infected fixed-cell monolayers, which argues for a direct effect of mAb on PBMC as opposed to an antibody effect on infected cell monolayers. In addition, such inhibiting effects could not be related to toxic effects of mAb on PBMC (not shown). IFN induction by other viruses such as Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Sendai virus and types A and B myxoviruses was also blocked by co-incubation of PBMC with TH22A5 mAb (not shown).",

            "text": "Our present data on the nature of porcine IPC are in agreement with several reports about the characterization of human IPC. Thus, following induction by different viruses including herpes virus, influenza virus, dengue virus or cytomegalovirus, as well as by mycoplasma membranes, human mononuclear leukocytes producing IFN~ were described as non-adherent, non-phagocytic, non-T,non-B cells (Trinchieri et aL, 1978; Kirchner et aL, 1979; Peter et aL, 1980; Lebon et aL, 1982; Abb et aL, 1983; Djeu et aL, 1982; Perussia et aL, 1985; Kurane et aL. 1986 ). Human IPC were generally shown to lack natural killer function (Lebon et aL, 1982; Abb et al., 1983; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly et al., 1988) , but to express MHC class II antigens (Abb et al., 1983 ; Perussia et al., 1985; Capobianchi et al., 1987; Oh et al., 1987; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly et aL, 1988) . A recent report using combined immunocytochemistry ,~o.,u,,a,~t ,,t on numan rt~Mt; stimulated by HSVinfected cells clearly showed that IPC lacked antigens typical of T and B lymphocytes, but expressed HLA-class II antigens (Sandberg et al., 1989a) . The same laboratory observed that IPC also expressed CD4 antigens (Sandberg et aL, 1989b) . The expression of MHC class II antigens led to the hypothesis that human IPC could be dendritic cells (Fitzgerald-Bocarsly et aL, 1988) . However, HLA-DR + cells could recently be divided into two separate subsets: a loosely adherent population meeting the functional criteria of dendritic cells but distinct from IPC which were non-adherent (Chehimi et ai., 1989) . Our data therefore indicate that porcine IFNa-producing cells in response to TGEV-infected cells have the same properties as human IPC: porcine IPC are non-phagocytic, non-adherent (Salmon et al., 1989) , non-T,non-B, MltC-clas~-II-positive and CD4 + cells. Preliminary experiments using DNA-RNA in situ hybridization suggested that porcine IFNa-mRNAcontaining cells were infrequent (around 1/104 PBMC; Buseyne and Charley, unpublished observations) as already described for human IPC (Goblet al., 1988) . Interestingly, one might hypothesize that a defined, albeit infrequent cell population exhibiting unusual phenotypic features could produce IFNa in response to a wide range of IFN inducers. In order to further analyse these cells and their mode of activation, it will be necessary to use positive selection procedures such as cell sorting (Sandberg et al., 1989b) .",

Comparable inhibition was obtained with 4 other anti-SLA class II mAb used as ascitic fluids. This inhibition is not observed when virus-infected cells are pretreated with mAb, then washed before PBMC are added. However, when PBMC are pretreated with mAb, then washed before induction, IFN yield is still reduced, which argues for a direct effect of anti-SLA class II antibodies on PBMC. In addition, PBMC are not lysed by such treatments. Therefore, these results suggest that masking of MHC class II antigens on the PBMC membrane reduces their responsiveness to IFN induction. This anti-SLA class-II-Ab-mediated blockage is observed when PBMC are induced by TGEV, Sendai, NDV or influenza virus. A similar observation was reported by Capobianchi et al. (1987) : pretreatment of human PBMC by anti-HLA-DR antibody reduced IFN0t yield after induction with mycoplasma membranes. Similarily, Ia antigens were shown to bind cell surface glycoproteins responsible for IFN induction (Hughes et al., 1986) . Therefore, our findings suggest that, in addition to mycoplasmas and cell surface glycoproteins, viruses could also interact with MHC class II antigens to induce IFN0t synthesis.",

In fact, anti-SLA class II mAb did not block TGEV replication in susceptible pig kidney cells (data not shown). The actual functional role of MHC class II molecules in the IFN0t induction process remains to be clarified\" they could represent broadly reactive recogni-t~u. ~t, m.tu~e~ tto~c to omd utllcrcnt IFN-inducing components (as suggested by Hughes et al., 1986) . Alternatively, MHC class II molecules could be involved in post-recognition events, such as internalization or recycling of membrane structures, which seem to precede activation of IFN0c synthesis (Lebon, 1985) . Experiments are in progress to further define the nature of virus lymphocyte interactions leading to IFN0t production.
