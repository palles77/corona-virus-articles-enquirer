It is one of the many protein proteinase inhibitor superfamilies that are involved in regulating mammalian homeostasis, including the serpins (e.g., a 1 -antitrypsin; AAT) and low-molecular-weight kunitz (e.g., tissue factor pathway inhibitor; TFPI), and kazal-type (e.g., pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitory; PSTI) inhibitors. Current knowledge of their function suggests that they primarily serve to inhibit the activity of lysosomal proteinases that may be released during normal or pathological cellular or tissue remodeling events.",

The name 'cystatin' was proposed by Barrett et al. in 1963 and later used to describe homologous proteins in the same superfamily. The first full sequence of a human cystatin was that of cystatin C. There are more than a dozen human cystatins all with different properties, unique distribution patterns, and functions. These have been grouped into four main cystatin types on the basis of DNA and protein sequence homology and over the last few years the superfamily has expanded to include additional CP inhibitors, molecules that have no CP inhibitory activity, and yet others that have evolved functions unrelated to CP inhibition.",

However, in addition to their function as CP inhibitors, the kininogens serve as substrates for a diverse group of serine proteinases collectively termed the kininogenases. The kininogenases liberate the kinin family of inflammatory peptides from the parent molecules. The kinins consist primarily of bradykinin (BK) and kallidin (lysyl bradykinin). BK is a nine amino acid peptide released during inflammation and tissue injury that possesses both direct and indirect actions in the airways including bronchoconstriction and bronchodilation, stimulation of cholinergic and sensory nerves, increased mucus secretion, and cough and edema resulting from promotion of microvascular leakage.

These regions form a surface on the cystatin molecule that can dock and bind into the enzymatically active site(s) of papain-like CPs. The classic example of a type II cystatin is cystatin C, for which the X-ray crystallographic structure of the chicken protein has been solved ( Figure 1 ). The main feature of the structure is a five-stranded b-sheet wrapped around a five turn a-helix commonly referred to as the 'cystatin fold'. The N-terminal 10 residues are disordered and flexible and the conserved G11 residue is present at the N-terminus of the five turn a-helix. The QXVXG motif is found on a hairpin loop located between bstrands B and C and the PW motif on a hairpin loop between b-strands D and E. Collectively, these three regions form a wedge-shaped edge complementary to the active site of the CP with many side-chain interactions. Each domain interacts with the target proteinase independently and binding of cystatins to CPs may or may not result in conformational changes in either protein. For example, cystatin binding to papain does not induce any conformational change in either protein whereas binding to cathepsin B involves the initial displacement of a loop occluding the active site to allow subsequent tight binding to occur. Cystatins differ considerably in their ability to displace the loop of cathepsin B.",

The CPs almost certainly contribute either directly or indirectly to this degradation, in particular, lysosomal cathepsins (cat) B, H, K, L, and S (see Cysteine Proteases, Cathepsins). Increased concentrations of cat L have been detected in the BAL fluids of patients with emphysema and alveolar macrophages from patients with COPD secrete more CP activity than macrophages from normal smokers or nonsmokers despite the fact that cystatin C concentrations are also increased. Direct inhibition of CP activity by the cystatins (primarily type II) in normal lung tissue likely contributes to the protection of the elastic lung tissue by directly inhibiting these CPs. The cystatins and CPs do not operate independently of other degradative systems (and their respective inhibitors) but participate in feedback systems that can produce profound changes in proteolytic activity referred to as the proteolytic burst (Figure 2) . For example, several matrix metalloelastases, produced by inflammatory cells or activated airway epithelium, can inactivate AAT. Bronchial epithelial cells secrete procathepsin B and cystatin C, both of which are substrates for neutrophil elastase. Procathepsin B is activated by neutrophil elastase while human cystatin C is inactivated by cleavage between amino acids G11 and G12. The latter observation may explain why active cat L has been found in the BAL fluid of COPD patients despite the presence of elevated cystatin C levels. Cystatin C is also produced by monocytes and macrophages and its release is downregulated by proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon gamma (IFN-g), which coincidentally increase Figure 1 Three-dimensional structure of chicken cystatin C. A five-turn a-helix (green) is in the center of the structure. The conserved G11 residue is highlighted in yellow at the aminoteminal end of the a-helix.

In the case of highmolecular kininogen, degradation by pKal creates a kinin-free two-chain disulfide-linked molecule containing a heavy chain and a light chain that retains CP inhibitory activity. tKal has been identified as the major kininogenase of the airway and cleaves both HK and low-mole cular-weight kininogen to yield lysyl-bradykinin (kallidin). In asthmatic airways, the underlying glandular epithelium releases tKal that contributes to the intial phase of kinin generation but the recruitment of activated monocytes, neutrophils, and alveolar macrophages contributes to the late increases in tKal that are associated with the development of airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). Activated mast cells, macrophages, and neutrophils also release the tryptase, cat L, and elastase that contribute to kinin generation.

SLPI inhibits neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and chymase. Elafin inhibits neutrophil elastase and proteinase-3. SLPI is 11.7 kDa; elafin (6 kDa) is a cleavage product of preelafin (also called trappin-2), which is 9.9 kDa. The inhibitory site of both inhibitors resides in the C-terminal four disulfide whey acidic protein (WAP) domain, which has 40% homology, and they belong to the WAP family of proteins located on chromosome 20q12-13. The N-terminal WAP domain of pre-elafin contains a transglutaminase substrate domain that enables the molecule to become tethered to cell surfaces and matrix proteins; proteolytic cleavage releases the C-terminal 6 kDa inhibitory domain. SLPI is also found in close association with elastic tissue, possibly reflecting its cationic properties. SLPI and elafin have antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, while SLPI has also been shown to have antiviral and antifungal properties. In addition, SLPI and elafin are immunomodulatory, interacting directly with lipopolysaccharide to subdue its inflammatory activity, and inhibiting release of mediators from inflammatory cells. SLPI also plays a significant role in wound healing, partly by preventing proteolytic activation of proinflammatory mediators. SLPI and elafin levels and activity change during lung diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pneumonia), reflecting the degree of inflammation, proteolytic load, and oxidative stress.
