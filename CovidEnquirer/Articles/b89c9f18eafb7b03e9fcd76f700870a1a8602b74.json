However, traditional vaccine development has proven insufficient to deal with pathogens that elude the immune system through highly variable and non-functional epitopes. Emerging B cell technologies have yielded potent monoclonal antibodies targeting conserved epitopes, and their structural characterization has provided templates for rational immunogen design. Here, we review immunogen design strategies that leverage structural information to steer bulk immune responses towards the induction of precise antibody specificities targeting key antigenic sites. Immunogens designed to elicit well-defined antibody responses will become the basis of what we dubbed precision vaccines. Such immunogens have been used to tackle long-standing vaccine problems and have demonstrated their potential to seed the next-generation of vaccines.",

In essence, this strategy relies on the isolation of nAbs from human or animal repertoires, followed by the structural characterization of the nAbantigen complex, and finally exploit the acquired atomiclevel information to design novel immunogens. A key challenge for next-generation vaccines, then, is to place neutralizing epitopes in the immune system's spotlight for efficient recognition and enhanced epitope-specific antibody elicitation. We refer to such class of vaccines as precision vaccines, given their extremely well-defined epitope-directed antibody response. An essential requisite for precision vaccines is to encode the structural information of epitopes targeted by broad and potent neutralizing antibodies in the designed immunogens.",

Despite this immunodominance towards the head domain, several epitopes in the HA stem region are targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) [8, 9] , providing a strong rationale for vaccines that aim to induce antibody responses towards the HA stem. Two independent studies reported the design of immunogens comprising only the HA-stem domain [10, 11 ] . Several rounds of structure-based design were performed, including the removal of the entire head domain followed by the introduction of stabilizing core mutations and linker design. Upon vaccination with stem derived antigens, mice, ferrets and cynomolgus monkeys mounted a cross-reactive antibody response and survived a challenge with a lethal dose of a highly pathogenic viral isolate.",

Center-bottom: The structure-based approaches can be classified according to expected epitope specificity and neutralization potency of the elicited antibody responses. Masking of non-neutralizing epitopes through glycosylation has also led to novel HIV-1 Envelope (Env) immunogens with reduced antigenicity to non-neutralizing epitopes. Two main targets of non-nAbs are the flexible Env V3 loop, as well as the bottom of recombinant Env, which is inaccessible on membrane-bound Env spikes. The introduction of two glycans on V3 was shown to dampen the immune response against this site upon rabbit immunization [15] . Similarly, glycosylation of the Env base showed reduced reactivity with sera of animals immunized with non-masked Env, indicating that glycan masking can render non-neutralizing epitopes inaccessible [16 ] .",

            "text": "Generally, these proteins tend to adopt a metastable prefusion state on the virion's surface (e.g. HIV, RSV, hMPV and others), undergoing large structural rearrangements to a stable postfusion conformation upon viral and host cell membrane fusion[17]. Serum studies by Magro et al. have revealed that RSV nAbs mostly target the prefusion state of the RSVF [18]. This fueled the idea of promoting the elicitation of antibodies directed against the prefusion conformation rather than postfusion. InTable 1, we summarize the design strategies used to accomplish the antigenic conformational stabilization.The structural determination of the prefusion conformation of RSVF [19] provided a template for designing prefusion-stabilized versions of RSVF, latter achieved by introducing intra-protomer disulfide bonds and cavity-filling hydrophobic mutations (Ds-Cav1)[20]. Similarly, Krarup et al. reported a stabilization strategy for RSVF, by introducing proline residues that prevent structural rearrangements required to adopt the postfusion conformation[21]. In immunization studies, prefusion RSVF was eight times more potent in terms of neutralization than postfusion RSVF, as observed in mice, nonhuman primates and cotton rats. A large fraction of the elicited antibodies was directed against the apex of RSVF, a site that undergoes profound conformational changes in the postfusion state[20]. In a follow up article, Joyce and colleagues further stabilized Ds-Cav1, resulting in an immunogen with improved physical stability in the prefusion state (RSVF-DS2). In mice, DS2 variants elicited up to four-fold more potent neutralizing responses as compared to Ds-Cav1, indicating that conformational stability correlated with immunogenicity[22 ]. As a more relevant model for human RSV disease, a bovine RSVF-DS2 version elicited bovine RSV neutralizing antibodies",

Yassine HM et al.: Hemagglutinin-stem nanoparticles generate heterosubtypic influenza protection. Nat Med 2015, 21:1065-1070. The immunodominant region of Influenza HA, the head domain, constantly undergoes antigenic drift to escape the immune response. To focus antibody responses on the immunologically subdominant HA stem region, the authors engineered a stem-only immunogen. Vaccination of mice and ferrets elicits a protective immune response against heterosubtypic virus challenge. This study is an important step towards eliciting subdomain-focused antibody responses, which are known to protect against diverse group 1 influenza strains. 12.
