In order to strengthen understanding of population structure, phylogeography, and evolutionary dynamics, we isolated Pseudomonas from cultivated and wild kiwifruit across six provinces in China. Based on the analysis of 80 sequenced Psa genomes, we show that China is the origin of the pandemic lineage but that strain diversity in China is confined to just a single clade. In contrast, Korea and Japan harbor strains from multiple clades. Distinct independent transmission events marked introduction of the pandemic lineage into New Zealand, Chile, Europe, Korea, and Japan. Despite high similarity within the core genome and minimal impact of within-clade recombination, we observed extensive variation even within the single clade from which the global pandemic arose.",

Earlier disease epidemics in China, South Korea, and Japan had regional impacts, however as infections were often lethal and the pathogen rapidly disseminated, Psa was predicted to pose a major threat to global kiwifruit production Koh et al. 2002) . Despite recognition of this threat-one subsequently realized in 2008-little was done to advance understanding of population structure, particularly across regions of eastern Asia that mark the native home of the genus Actinidia.",

The causal agent was described as Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) ). An outbreak of disease with symptoms similar to those produced by Psa was reported to have occurred in [1983] [1984] in Hunan, China, though no positive identification was made or isolates stored at that time (Fang et al. 1990) . Psa was also isolated from infected green kiwifruit in Korea shortly thereafter (Koh et al. 1994) . The cultivation of more recently developed gold-fruiting cultivars derived from A. chinensis var. chinensis (e.g., \"Hort16A\") began only in the 2000s and an outbreak of global proportions soon followed. The first published notices of the latest outbreak on gold kiwifruit issued from Italy in 2008, with reports from neighboring European countries, New Zealand, Asia, and Chile occurring soon after (Balestra et al. 2010; Abelleira et al. 2011; Everett et al. 2011; Vanneste et al. 2011; European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization 2011; Koh et al. 2012; Sawada et al. 2015) . Whole genome sequencing showed the most recent global outbreak of disease was caused by a new clade of Psa (previously referred to as Psa-V and now referred to as Psa-3), whereas earlier disease incidents in Japan and Korea were caused by strains forming separate clades referred to as Psa-1 (previously Psa-J) and Psa-2 (previously Psa-K), respectively (Marcelletti et al. 2011; Mazzaglia et al. 2012; Butler et al. 2013; McCann et al. 2013) . These clades are marked by substantial variation in their complement of type III secreted effectors, which are required for virulence in P. syringae. Despite the surprising level of within-pathovar differences in virulence gene repertoires occurring subsequent to the divergence of these three clades, strains from each clade are capable of infecting and growing to high levels in both A. chinensis var. deliciosa and A. chinensis var. chinensis (McCann et al. 2013) .",

Identifying the source from which Psa emerged to cause separate outbreaks remains an important question. Intriguingly, despite the divergence in both the core and flexible genome, these distinct clades nevertheless exhibit evidence of recombination with each other and unknown donors (McCann et al. 2013 ). This suggests each clade emerged from a recombining source population. Definitive evidence for the location, extent of diversity, and evolutionary processes operating within this population remain elusive. Early reports suggested China may be the source of the latest global outbreak (Butler et al. 2013; McCann et al. 2013) . Although the strains of Psa available at that time did not provide unambiguous and well-supported evidence of a Chinese origin, this speculation was based on the fact that kiwifruit are native to China; it is the provenance of the plant material selected for commercial and breeding purposes in China, New Zealand, Italy, and other kiwifruit growing regions; there is extensive trade in plant material between all of these regions; and one Chinese isolate was found to carry an integrative and conjugative element (ICE) that was also found in New Zealand Psa-3 isolates (Butler et al. 2013) .",

Genome sequencing of 50 isolates and the inclusion of an additional 30 previously sequenced isolates show that whereas China is the origin of the pandemic lineage of Psa, only a single clade is currently present in China, whereas strains from multiple clades are present in both Korea and Japan. Strains from the pandemic lineage are closely related to each other, displaying reduced pairwise nucleotide diversity relative to that exhibited between strains in other clades, indicating a more recent origin. Distinct transmission events were responsible for introduction of the pandemic lineage of Psa into New Zealand, Chile, and Europe. Two independent transmission events occurred between China and Korea, and two Japanese isolates from 2014 cluster with New Zealand Psa. Despite high similarity at the level of the core genome and negligible impact of within-lineage recombination, there has been substantial gene gain and loss even within the single clade from which the global pandemic arose.",

Plants sampled were classified as asymptomatic, atypical or symptomatic for Psa infection. Sampling of wild plants occurred after first surveying the disease status of all identifiable Actinidia spp. in the site: no visible symptoms of disease were found among all wild Actinidia spp. observed. A total of 280 plants were sampled (148 cultivated, 132 wild) across eight provinces (Anhui, Chongqing, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Sichuan) . Bacterial strain isolations were performed from same-day sampled leaf and stem tissue by homogenizing leaf or stem tissue in 800 ml 10 mM MgSO 4 and plating the homogenate on Pseudomonas selective media (King's B supplemented with cetrimide, fucidin, and cephalosporin, Oxoid). Isolations were performed in hotel rooms; movement to the next sampling location (including mobile laboratory relocation) resulted in variable incubation temperatures. Plates were incubated 48 h between 25 and 30 C. Subsequent to the return to the laboratory (Wuhan Botanical Garden, Hubei), single colonies were restreaked and tested for oxidase activity and used to inoculate liquid overnight cultures in KB. Strains were then stored at \u00c080 C in 15% glycerol and the remainder of the liquid culture was reserved for genomic DNA isolation by freezing the pelleted bacterial cells at \u00c020 C. Genomic DNA extractions were performed using the Promega Wizard 96-well genomic DNA purification system. Initial strain identification was performed by sequencing the citrate synthase gene (cts, aka gltA [Sarkar and Guttman 2004] ). 1419 total single colony isolates were recovered, of which 819 were identified. Because no Psa was present among the identified isolates from Anhui and Henan, these provinces are not represented in our data. No Psa was isolated from asymptomatic plants or plants displaying atypical symptoms of infection. Subsequent to strain identification, 2 \u00c2 125 bp paired-end sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using 500 bp libraries (Novogene, Guangzhou, China). Additional 2 \u00c2 250 bp paired-end sequencing was performed at New Zealand Genomics Limited (Auckland, New Zealand) using the MiSeq platform.",

Removal of 3,122 recombinant positions produced a 1,059,722 bp core genome alignment including 2,953 variant sites. A starting tree was used to compute 100 bootstrap replicates (-m GTRGAMMA -p $RANDOM -b $RANDOM -# 100), in turn used to draw bipartitions on the best scoring tree (-m GTRCAT -p $RANDOM -f b). Phylogenies were visualized with FigTree (v.1.4.2 http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Membership within each phylogenetic clade corresponds to a minimum average nucleotide identity of 99.70%. The average nucleotide identity was determined using a BLAST-based approach in JspeciesWS (ANIb), using a subset of 32 Psa genome assemblies spanning all clades (Richter et al. 2016) . In order to fully resolve the relationships between more closely related recent outbreak strains, a phylogeny was constructed using only the 62 Psa-3 strains. This was determined using a 4,853,155 bp core genome alignment (excluding 258 recombinant SNPs), comprising invariant sites and 1,948 nonrecombinant SNPs and invariant sites. Trees were built with the generalized time-reversible model and gamma distribution of sitespecific rate variation (GTR + \u00c0) and 100 bootstrap replicates. Psa C16 was used to root the tree as this was shown to be the most divergent member of Psa-3 when including strains from multiple clades. Nodes shown have minimum bootstrap support values of 50.",

Combined with 30 Psa genomes from earlier outbreaks and different geographic regions (e.g., Italy and Chile), our samples represent the main Psa genotypes from the countries producing 90% of kiwifruit production worldwide. The completed reference genome of Psa NZ13 (ICMP 18884, CP011972.1, CP011973.1) comprises a 6,580,291bp chromosome and 74,423 bp plasmid (McCann et al. 2013; Templeton et al. 2015) . Read mapping and variant calling with reference to the Psa NZ13 chromosome produced a 1,059,722 bp nonrecombinant core genome for all 80 genomes, including 2,953 nonrecombinant SNPs. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis showed the four clades of Psa known to cause bleeding canker disease in kiwifruit were represented among the 80 strains ( fig. 1 ). The first clade (Psa-1) includes the pathotype strain of Psa isolated and described during the first recorded epidemic of bleeding canker disease in Japan (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) . The second clade (Psa-2) includes isolates from an epidemic in South Korea (1997 Korea ( -1998 , and the third clade (Psa-3) includes isolates that define the global pandemic lineage (2008 to present). A fourth clade (Psa-5) is represented by a single strain, as no additional sequences or isolates were available (Fujikawa and Sawada 2016) . The average between and within-clade pairwise identity is 98.93% and 99.73%, respectively (table 1). All Psa isolated from kiwifruit across six different provinces in China are members of the same clade: Psa-3. A subset of Chinese strains group with the Psa isolated during the global outbreak in Italy, Portugal, New Zealand, and Chile. This subset is referred to as the pandemic lineage of Psa-3.",

To minimize the possibility of recombination affecting the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships and genetic distance within Psa-3, ClonalFrameML was employed to identify and remove 258 SNPs with a high probability of being introduced by recombination rather than mutation, retaining 1,948 nonrecombinant SNPs. The within-clade ratio of recombination to mutation (R/theta) is reduced in Psa-3 (6.75 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 \u00b1 3.24 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 ) relative to between clade rates (1.27 \u00b1 5.16 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 ), and the mean divergence of imported DNA within Psa-3 is 8.54 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 \u00b1 5.18 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 compared with 5.68 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 \u00b1 1.04 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 between clades. Although recombination has occurred within Psa-3, it is less frequent and has introduced fewer polymorphisms relative to mutation: when accounting for polymorphisms present in recombinant regions identified by ClonalFrameML and/or present on transposons, plasmids, and other mobile elements, 7-fold more polymorphisms were introduced by mutation relative to recombination (table 2) . Recombination has a more pronounced impact between clades, where substitutions are slightly more likely to have been introduced by recombination than by mutation (table 2).",

In order to estimate the divergence time of the pandemic lineages we performed linear regression of root-to-tip distances against sampling dates using the RAxML phylogenies determined from the nonrecombinant core genome of Psa-3. No temporal signal was identified in the data. There were poor correlations between substitution accumulation and sampling dates, indicating the sampling period is too short for sufficient substitutions to occur. There may also be variation in the substitution rate within even a single clade. Forty-four unique nonrecombinant SNPs were identified among the 21 pandemic Psa-3 genomes sampled over 5 years in New Zealand [an average of 2.10 per genome] producing an estimated rate of 8.7 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 substitutions per site per year. The relatively slow substitution rate and the strong bottleneck effect experienced during infections hinders efforts to reconstruct patterns of transmission, as the global dissemination of a pandemic strain may occur extremely rapidly (Grad and Lipsitch 2014; Biek et al. 2015) . The estimated divergence time of Psa broadly considered is likely older than the pandemic and epidemic events with which they are associated: the earliest report of disease cause by Psa-1 occurred in 1984 and the first report of infection from the latest pandemic was issued in 2008.",

The highest density of polymorphism was detected in and around the~100kb integrative and conjugative element (ICE) in Psa NZ13 (5.41-5.51Mb, (Krzywinski et al. 2009 ). Psa NZ13 CDS are displayed in the first and second ring (blue), with annotated Type 3 secretion system and effectors highlighted (red). Inner rings display polymorphisms in Psa-3 genomes ordered from most to least divergent relative to Psa NZ13. The most polymorphic region corresponds to the location of the integrative and conjugative element (ICE) in Psa NZ13. fig. 2 ). Of the 1,948 SNPs mapping to the nonrecombinant nonmobile core genome, 58.1% (1,132) are strain specific. Most strain-specific SNPs are found in the two most divergent members of the Psa-3 clade: Psa C16 and C17, with 736 and 157 strain-specific SNPs, respectively. The remaining isolates have an average of 4.0 strain-specific SNPs, ranging from 0 to 44 SNPs per strains. There are 816 SNPs shared between two or more Psa-3 strains. The pandemic clade differs from the more divergent Chinese strains by 72 shared SNPs. Within the pandemic lineage there are 125 strain-specific SNPs, an average of 3.1 unique SNPs per strain (ranging from 0 to 27 SNPs) and an additional 29 SNPs shared among pandemic strains. Protein-coding sequence accounts for 88.4% of the nonrecombinant, gap-free core genome of this clade. We observed that 78.9% (1,536/1,948) of mutations occurred in protein coding sequence, significantly different from the expectation (1,722/1,948) in the absence of selection (Pearson's 2 test: P < 0.0001, 2 = 173.46). This suggests there is selection against mutations occurring in protein coding sequences. Of the 953 substitutions introduced by mutation in Psa-3, 927 resulted in amino acid substitutions, two resulted in extensions and 24 resulted in premature truncations.",

S2 , Supplemental Material online). Osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs, in particular opgG and opgH) are required for motility, biofilm formation and virulence in various plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi (Page et al. 2001; Klosterman et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2014 ). Homologs of opgGH remain intact in the pandemic lineage, yet the premature stop mutation in opgC likely results in the loss of glucan succinylation. The soft-rot pathogen Dickeya dadantii expresses OpgC in high osmolarity conditions, resulting in the substitution of OPGs by O-succinyl residues (Bontemps-Gallo et al. 2016) . The most striking difference between the pandemic lineage and more divergent Chinese Psa-3 strains is the deletion of multiple genes involved in cellulose production and acetylation (see supplementary fig. S2 , Supplemental Material online) (Spiers et al. 2002) . In P. fluorescens SBW25 deletion of the cellulose-encoding Wss operon significantly compromises ability to colonize plant surfaces and in particular the phyllosphere of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) seedlings (Gal et al. 2003) . It is possible that loss of this locus aids movement through the vascular system and/or dissemination between plants, by limiting capacity for surface colonization.",

This is a considerable amount of variation in a pathogen described as clonal and monomorphic, particular since our analysis includes only strains from one clade of a monophyletic pathovar group (McCann et al. 2013) . A comparative analysis of 64 genomes spanning the entire P. syringae species complex estimated the core genome to be~48% of an average P. syringae genome, and 20.6% of the total pangenome (Nowell et al. 2016) . Estimated core genome sizes for other bacterial plant pathogens range from~17% of the entire Ralstonia solanacearum pangenome (n = 19 genomes, (Ailloud et al. 2015) ) to~59% of the Erwinia amylovora pangenome (n = 12 genomes, (Mann et al. 2013) ). These estimates are sensitive to sequencing quality, assembly and annotation errors, vary according to phylogenetic breadth and depth of sampling, and will certainly change with increasing sequence availability.

One early isolate (Psa K3, 1997) groups with the Japanese isolates in Psa-1; Psa K7 (2014) groups with the more diverse Chinese isolates in Psa-3, and Psa K5 (2014) is a member of the Psa-3 pandemic lineage. Korea therefore harbors a more diverse population of Psa than China, with strains from three distinct clades of Psa (1, 2, pandemic and nonpandemic 3). The novel group of Psa recently identified in Japan (Psa-5) appears to share an ancestor with the Korean Psa-2 strains. With the recent dissemination of pandemic Psa-3 and the historical presence of Psa-1 in Japan, the Japanese population of Psa is comprised of three distinct clades of Psa (1, 5 and pandemic Psa-3). The coexistence of multiple clades in both Japan and Korea suggests that the source population of all Psa resides there rather than in China. The potential transmission of a nonpandemic Psa-3 strain from China to Korea and the identification of a new clade in Japan supports our earlier assertion that variants will continue to emerge to cause local epidemics and global pandemics in the future (McCann et al. 2013) .",

            "text": "Considering that the divergence time of this monophyletic pathovar predates the commercialization of kiwifruit by hundreds if not thousands of years, Psa is likely associated with a nondomesticated host(s) in the wild (Fujikawa and Sawada 2016; McCann et al. 2013 ). Both A. chinensis var. deliciosa or A. chinensis var. chinensis are found in natural ecosystems and have overlapping habitat ranges with cultivated kiwifruit in many areas. However, despite isolating 746 Pseudomonas strains from both wild and cultivated kiwifruit during this sampling program, we did not identify Psa among any of the 188 Pseudomonas spp. isolated from 98 wild A. chinensis var. deliciosa or A. chinensis var. chinensis sampled across China (see supplementary table S2, Supplemental Material online). Very few Actinidia spp. have ranges extending to South Korea and Japan-those that do include A. arguta, A. kolomikta, A. polygama, and A. rufa. A. arguta is broadly distributed across both Korea and Japan. Early work by Ushiyama et al. (1992) found that Psa could be isolated from symptomatic A. arguta plants in Japan. The possibility that this wild relative of kiwifruit harbors diverse strains of Psa that may emerge to cause future outbreaks is currently under investigation. Alternately, a host shift from another domesticated crop may have occurred after the expansion of kiwifruit cultivation.",

Where ecological and genetic factors restrict pathogens to a small number of plant hosts greater progress has been made, but for facultative pathogens such as P. syringae that colonize multiple hosts and are widely distributed among both plant and nonplant habitats, the environmental reservoirs of disease and factors affecting their evolutionary emergence are difficult to unravel (Singh et al. 2011; Monteil et al. 2016) .",

It is now possible to exclude China as the native home to the source population, but the precise location remains unclear. Nonetheless, it is likely, given the extent of diversity among Psa isolates and the time-line to domestication, that ancestral populations exist in nonagricultural plant communities. Attention now turns to Korea and Japan and the interplay between genetic and ecological factors that have shaped Psa evolution.",

Japanese pandemic strains cluster with New Zealand strains, and share all six clade-defining mutations. This suggests that pandemic Psa-3 was either introduced into Japan via New Zealand, or from the same as-yet unknown region in China from which transmission to New Zealand occurred. Psa-3 was first identified as causing disease in four prefectures across Japan in April 2014(Sawada et al. 2015). Japan imported pollen and plant material from both China and New Zealand prior and subsequent to Psa-3 detection in both those countries, though the amount of pollen imported from New Zealand in 2012 (349 kg) and 2013 (190 kg) far outweighed the amount imported from China (1 kg in both 2012 and 2013) (Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2016). Although resolving the origin of transmission events is of much interest the rate of evolution places a lower bound on the ability of genomic epidemiology to deliver useful data. Divergence dating methods have been successfully applied to infer epidemiological processes for numerous bacterial mammalian pathogens, though our present estimate of Psa's genome-wide evolutionary rate places it among the slowest evolving bacteria included in a recent survey of 36 whole genome data sets(Duch\u00ea ne et al. 2016).",
