Is the global community ready, in mind-set and resources, 53 to implement such measures? For countries with imported cases and/or early outbreaks of 2019-nCoV like the 54 US, WHO recommends the immediate following actions detailed in Table 2. 55 56 Diagnosis of 2019-nCoV57There are three main ways to detect 2019-nCoV in naso-oro-pharyngeal, broncho-alveolar, blood and fecal 58 samples, each with its distinct diagnostic value: Active virus shedding: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of 2019-nCoV single-60 stranded RNA. Turnaround for testing can be as short as 3-6 hours but RT-PCR requires specialised 61 machines, test kits and expertise so they are not easily available and accessible; thus, transportation time 62 needs to be factored in.5 With presence of symptoms and signs of pneumonia in high 2019-nCoV-load hospital settings and where 64 sampling is too high risk [(e.g. shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE)]: Chest computed tomography with its characteristic features of ground glass opacities and consolidation may be useful.6 Past infection: Serological testing now available but false-positive and false-negative rates are still of treatment of 2019-nCoV is symptomatic until the infected self-recovers. For the sub-group of 71 patients who develop severe disease, besides intensive care, studies are underway to explore the use of anti-72 virals, anti-inflammatories and monoclonal antibodies, especially in those who develop cytokine storm.8 73Vaccines are also being developed but experts estimate that it will take 6 months before scientists know 74 whether any of the vaccines in development will help against 2019-nCoV and at least a year before one will be For both staff and patients, the following precautions should be adopted: personal hygiene; home if you have flu symptoms; if unwell, seek medical help and wear a mask84 when venturing outside. Misinformation and misconceptions can trigger panic and irrational behaviour so 85 everyone should stay up-to-date on the rapidly evolving 2019-nCoV situation from reliable information sources 86 like CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/media/rss-govd.html) & WHO 87 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen) who can send 88 persons updates automatically. Everyone can expect more social distancing measures including business 89 continuity plans such a split-teams, restricted movement and work-from-home arrangements, periodic school 90 closures and remote learning, travel restrictions, greater use of video-conferencing, e-commerce platforms, 91 tele-medicine, and fewer large social events and gatherings. patients undergoing rehabilitation who need to be quarantined (e.g. from contact with a positive case) 97 or when they themselves become ill with 2019-nCoV, deconditioning and how to provide rehabilitation while 98 protecting healthcare staff are major concerns. Practical advice would include continuation of home exercises 99 last prescribed, and continued attendance at rehabilitation centres if well but with stepped-up infection control 100 measures such as patient screening for fever and flu symptoms at the entrance. Systematic reviews on tele-101 rehabilitation interventions after stroke have demonstrated either better or equal salutary effects on motor, 102 higher cortical, and mood disorders compared with conventional face-to-face therapy. 10 However, studies on 103 the effectiveness of tele-rehabilitation for non-stroke conditions are still lacking. Nevertheless, during 104 situations like outbreaks, tele-rehabilitation has the additional advantage of continuing rehabilitation 105 supervision remotely without risk of virus exposure. is an immunocompromising disease that increases the risk of severe 2019-nCoV infection and 109 mortality. Diabetes is also a risk factor for common conditions that require rehabilitation like cardiovascular 110 disease and stroke which themselves increase the mortality risk. Other common conditions needing 111 rehabilitation like chronic respiratory disease and cancer are also associated with higher risk of mortality from 112 2019-nCoV. Hence, our rehabilitation patients are at higher risk of severe and fatal 2019-nCoV infections. For 113 those who are capable of performing rehabilitation at home with guidance from tele-rehabilitation, this should 114 be their first option. For the rest who need centre-based or inpatient rehabilitation, we recommend fever and 115 flu symptom monitoring to separate the well from the unwell, and strict infection control measures including 116 handwashing between patients to reduce virus transmission. Patients who are symptomatic should be 117 separated from the well, quarantined and tested for 2019-nCoV, and isolated and treated if positive. Hospital 118 management should designate and prepare isolation rooms with adequate PPE and trained staff.",

It may not be wise to deploy HCWs with chronic respiratory problems to hospital areas Business Continuity Plans are organizational strategies that allow the workforce to continue functioning if a significant subset of the workforce needs to be quarantined or worse, falls ill. This usually involves 152 arrangements like split teams, restricted movement and work-from-home arrangements. With the exception of 153 clerical staff and tele-rehabilitation, it is impractical for rehabilitation HCWs to work from home as our 154 discipline is very hands-on. Hence, strategies like split teams and restricted movement are more relevant in 155 rehabilitation. Split teams is complete physical division of a workforce into (usually two) sub-teams with each 156 containing the necessary skill sets to continue most of its functions if one sub-team becomes unable to work.Restricted movement is another strategy whereby the principle is every staff in a sub-team does not come in 158 physical contact with any staff from other sub-team(s) to minimise risk of cross-infection. Hospital 159 management should also review triage processes at entry points and workflows that separate high-risk from 160 low-risk areas and sub-teams. Other often forgotten issues are HCWs who are parents of young children. If schools or day care centres close and both parents are working, HCWs may be forced to stay home to look childcare and temporary rooming arrangements for staff.Communication with StaffJust as it is important for everyone to stay up-to-date about 2019-nCoV, it is especially important for hospital",
