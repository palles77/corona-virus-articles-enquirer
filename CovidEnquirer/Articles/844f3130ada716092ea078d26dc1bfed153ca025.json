Starting from 24 h after CCoV infection, cells morphology appeared dramatically changed, with cells rounding and detachment from culture surface. Morphologic and biochemical features of apoptosis, such as blebbing of the plasma membrane, translocation of phosphatidilserine to cell surface and annexin V positive staining, nuclear fragmentation, apoptotic bodies formation and DNA laddering, were detected in CCoV-infected cells. Propidium iodide staining of infected culture indicated the appearance of hypodiploid DNA peak corresponding to apoptotic cell population. Commonly to other animal coronavirus infection caspase-3 is likely to contribute to the execution phase of apoptosis induced by CCoV in A-72 cells since we found activation of enzymatic activity as well as procaspase-3 activating cleavage. Apoptotic death of infected cells is detrimental as it causes cell and tissue destruction as well as inflammatory responses. Therefore in the case of CCoV associated gastroenteritis, apoptosis of epithelial mucosa cells may be responsible for pathology induced by CCoV infection. #",

Apoptosis is a physiological process defined by typical changes in cellular morphology and biochemical features including DNA fragmentation, cytoplasm vacuolization, chromatin condensation and margination and cellular breakdown into apoptotic bodies (Kerr et al., 1972) . Intracellular pathways leading to apoptotic death can be activated either by viruses or by triggering cellular pathways that activate apoptotic program of the cell. In any case, virusinduced apoptosis could be detrimental for the host and it is a common event in lytic viral infections. Several animal and human coronaviruses are reported as acute lytic infections and apoptotic cell death can be one possible mechanism of cell damage induced by these viruses.",
