One of the most publicized cases is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) whose outbreak and rapid spread in more than 25 countries in early 2003, claimed numerous lives and caused tremendous economic losses. Other public health threats include the recent anthrax attack and outbreak of avian influenza in the United States. It is predicted that new pathogens, originating either naturally or from bioterrorism, will continue to emerge and cause new public health emergencies [1] . In order to contain the spread of infectious diseases, preparedness planning, a vigilant health system, strengthened domestic, and global disease surveil-lance, and strong interdisciplinary partnerships are needed. Admittedly, information technology which facilitates access to critical information at the opportune moment will play a strategic role in improving the delivery and effectiveness of quality patient care, and helping domestic and international communities to adequately respond to medical emergencies in a timely and efficient manner.",

Therefore, response to public health emergencies should be regarded as a global issue and a close worldwide co-ordination is needed. Particular attention should be paid to developing countries that have relatively fewer resources to deal with public health emergencies. China was one of the countries that were the most affected by SARS. Among the 8445 cases re-ported to the World Health Organization (WHO), 5327 (63%) were from China [2] . Exploiting many effective control measures, China was able to successfully deter the outbreak in a relatively short time [3] . Nonetheless, the rampancy of SARS in the early stage of the outbreak has resulted in a chaos and exposed the fragility of China's public health information systems.

According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), there exist 217 information technologies and decision support systems of potential use in the event of a bioterrorist attack or other public health emergencies involving naturally occurring epidemics [12] . One of the most important applications of IT is public health surveillance which encompasses the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data for use in planning, implementing, and evaluating public health practice [13, 14] . Some example surveillance systems include a national retail data monitor which was designed to collect and analyze sales of over-the-counter health products to detect outbreak of disease [15] , a clinical data warehouse which was used for hospital infection control [16] , a data mining surveillance system which can provide sophisticated capability to control hospital infection and public health [17] , and a real-time outbreak and disaster surveillance system which was utilized for early detection of disease outbreaks [18] .",

The Public Health Information Network (PHIN) is a framework created by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Based on defined data and vocabulary standards and strong collaborative relationships, the PHIN will enable consistent exchange of response, health, and disease tracking data between public health partners. The PHIN is composed of five key components: detection and monitoring, data analysis, knowledge management, alerting, and response. Other federal initiatives include: (1) the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) which is an initiative that promotes the use of data and information system standards to advance the development of efficient, integrated, and interoperable surveillance systems at federal, state and local levels [19] , (2) the BioNet which is a national network of public health laboratories and federal food regulatory agencies helping the CDC to rapidly detect and determine possible links between disease agents during terrorist attacks [20] , and (3) the National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) which is an initiative set forth to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and overall quality of health and health care in the US, a comprehensive knowledge-based network of interoperable systems, and the set of technologies, standards, applications, systems, values, and laws that support all facets of individual health, health care, and public health [21] .

An integrated disease surveillance framework has been proposed for rapidly detecting, tracking, and managing public health threats [22] , which contains six functions: data collection, detection, alert and early warning, resource planning, response assessment and evaluation, and investigation and modeling. Another public health emergency response system was proposed as a decentralized model which gives states responsibility for collecting and disseminating all necessary information and co-ordinating surveillance and response [23] . According to this model, systems in different states must be compatible on the basis of common data standards so that the federal government can oversee a national network, and each state should cope with emergencies at a micro-level. In addition, some researchers contended that state and local health departments should build dual-or multiple-use public health information infrastructure [24] , suggesting that the public health information system should be able to respond and detect not only bioterrorism, but also other infectious disease outbreaks, chemical spills or leakages, food and water contamination scenarios, and animal disease outbreaks.",

            "text": "Based on experiences of the ''Emergency Management Information System and Reference Index'' (EMISARI) at the Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP), Turoff [25] asserts that ''an emergency system must be viewed as a structured group communication system where the protocols and communication structures are provided, but there is little content about a particular crisis situation except as an integrated electronic library of external data and information sources'' (p. 30). As a consequence, the design of emergency information systems should focus on the group communication process by accommodating how humans collect, contribute, and utilize data in a time-urgent manner [25] . Given that Turoff's remark is about generic emergency response information system, it is applicable to public health emergency response. It suggests that public health emergency response information systems can also be viewed as structured group communication systems. Turoff et al. [26] have articulated five criteria for the design of such a group communication system: metaphors, roles, notifications, context visibility, and hypertext. Metaphors, which pertain to the interface design, are the mental models of the system that help users to create a cognitive map between task objectives and interface elements. Roles reflect various parties' responsibilities in an event, and this concept should be built into the design of the group communication system by offering specific privileges and tools to different users. Notifications are relevant alerts to a user of change in status, data, or other information. The group communication system should raise appropriate notifications when events or actions of other users take place to cause the change. Context visibility refers to the idea that the components of the meaningful data objects are presented in a context that relates to the understandings of the user, that is, when the user activates a certain object the system should be able to know the user's intention and provide a list of relevant action choices. Hypertext refers to ''the possibility of multiple two way linkages with semantic meanings that allowed a person to utilize any item in the content of the application as a set of menu alternatives to move to another content or functionalities in the interface'' [26] . The criteria recommended by Turoff et al. assume the existence of communications networks and computing technologies and focuses on the software and interface design features.",

Additional documents were reviewed to retrieve pertinent information. These documents include government IT policies and regulations, meeting minutes, reports, development plans, media reports, and news. The credibility of the governmental documents is guaranteed, since they were either obtained from government officials or downloaded from official government websites. The quality of media reports and news is likely to be questionable. Nevertheless, this is not considered a problem, since the triangulation method was employed in this study. Triangulation is a widely accepted case research method which requires collecting data from multiple information sources and posits that multi-source data will corroborate each other and increase validity [27] . Using the triangulation method, we only included in this article the information that appeared consistently in multiple sources and discarded the conflicting information. In addition, the manuscript of this paper was reviewed by a leading health informatics researcher in China who has worked with China's central government on major public health information technology initiatives, including the PHERIS project. His review has largely ensured the validity of this paper by verifying the information gathered from interviews and non-governmental sources, such as media reports and news.

In addition, surveillance reports have to be approved by relevant officials at each layer before they can move up to the next layer. As a result, the reporting cycle time is prolonged and local officials' interference could affect the accuracy of the reports. During the SARS event, it took 8-9 days on average to report a SARS case from the patient's location to the MOH, and 3-4 days to report a diagnosed SARS case from hospitals to the MOH.

During this phase, CDCs and health care organizations at the county level or above and some health care organizations at the village level have deployed SARS reporting systems and established SARS clinical examination and alert systems. The SARS reporting system is a secure Web-based application which allows users to report SARS cases electronically to a central database. In addition, the disease surveillance system and the command center were designed in this phase and preparations were made to roll out these systems. The second phase is planned to finish at the end of 2004. One of the major objectives in this phase is to build a national computer network infrastructure to support public health data exchange. A five-level computer network will be constructed to connect health administrative agencies, CDCs, and health care organizations at the national, province, city, county, and village levels. Another major objective of the second phase is to complete the development of the disease surveillance system so that the online reporting system not only covers SARS but all types of public health emergencies. Moreover, the second phase also intends to develop some national public health databases which can be used as knowledge bases for healthcare providers when they encounter public health emergencies, and to start and partially complete the development of the command center. The third phase is planned to complete at the end of 2005. The objective of this phase is to complete all the tasks of the development of PHERIS and realize information sharing and co-ordination among relevant organizations so that the public health emergency can be handled efficiently and effectively.",

            "text": "According to the MOH, public health emergencies refer to events that occur unexpectedly and can cause or potentially cause mass destruction to the public health. The Public Health Emergency Response Regulations defined four categories of such events: (1) serious epidemics, (2) mass diseases with unknown causes, (3) large scope food or profession poisoning, and (4) other events that can severely affect public health, for example, leaking of infectious bacteria from laboratories. The public health alert system in China has three levels: yellow alert, orange alert, and red alert. Fig. 1 depicts the structure of this alert system. Two levels of public health emergency response plans are triggered by emergency alerts: the provincial and the national. If the public health emergency is confined within a certain region of a province, the provincial plan will be appropriate. If the public health emergency is diffused across provinces and endangers the national public health, the national plan will be needed. Specifically, in the event of a yellow alert, the provincial public health emergency response will become ready; in the event of an orange alert, a provincial public health emergency response will be started or the national emergency response will be ready; in the event of a red alert, the national emergency response plan will be activated. The national public health emergency response plan signifies the highest level of public health threat, and China responds to this type of crisis by gathering relevant departments in the State Council and military to form a national emergency command center. One of the leaders of the State Council, that is, the premier or a vice premier, will be appointed as the commander to direct actions resolving the emergency. The command center co-ordinates and allocates national resources, makes major deci-sions, determines outward statements in press conferences, and possibly resorts to police and military forces. On the other hand, the provincial public health emergency plan is determined by the provincial government. A command center with the provincial government leader as the commander will be organized to direct emergency response activities. The difference between the national plan and the provincial plan is mainly the scope of the response activities. In addition, it should be noted that when a public health emergency response plan becomes ready, it does not necessarily have to be activated. In this scenario, the major task would be to continue carrying out disease surveillance and epidemiological investigation to examine how the emergency develops. Related stakeholders are informed to make preparations and some resources might be allocated. But if the emergency shows no sign of escalation or is controlled before it escalates, the alert would be cancelled. The major responsibilities of the MOH are supervising and co-ordinating a wide range of activities relating to the emergency, such as organizing public health surveillance and reporting, applying for approval to start the national public health emergency response plan from the State Council, organizing and co-ordinating professional organizations to conduct field investigations, treating infected patients, tracing, sterilizing, or quarantining people who were in contact with infected patients, developing technological standards, declaring new infectious disease as legal infectious disease according to pertinent laws (only legal infectious diseases can trigger public health emergency alerts), and ",

Table 1 shows the content of each database. The data collected for PHERIS are heterogeneous. They are of a wide range of types, such as socioeconomics, humanity, hydrology, meteorology, environment, natural disaster, and health care. They could be numbers, texts, figures or pictures, and they could be real time data or historical data. Data from various sources will be integrated under the Microsoft .NET framework. From the network aspect, a ''five-layer and three-level'' network structure will be developed as the underlying infrastructure for PHERIS. The five layers refer to CDCs, health administrative agencies, and healthcare organizations at the levels of: (1) villages and towns, (2) counties and districts, (3) prefectures and cities, (4) provinces, and (5) nation. They are connected to the national public data network by broadband fiber lines, digital microwave, satellite communications, modem, and public telephone systems, thus forming a public health information virtual environment. The choice of communication method depends on the financial capability of different areas. The three levels refer to the establishment of major public health intranets at the city (or prefecture), province, and national level. A hierarchical star topology results from this network structure, where many villages and counties connecting to one city center, many cities connecting to one provincial center, and many provinces connecting to the national center. Fig. 2 depicts the topology. In addition, the provincial and city intranets provide network services and data services to public health related local organizations and form various community public health information networks.",

In order to facilitate public health surveillance, CDCs at the city and county levels will develop infectious disease databases and public health risk factor databases. Regular updates will be made to these databases on the basis of surveillance reports and epidemiological investigations. Given that many Chinese health care workers lack the ability to use computers, personnel training will be carried out along with the development of the surveillance system.

The ongoing development of PHERIS will provide a complete package for China to rapidly detect emergencies, effectively share critical information among key stakeholders, and competently manage emergencies. Comparing PHERIS with the five criteria recommended by Turoff et al. [26] , we find that the concepts of roles and notifications have been partly built into the system, while metaphors, context visibility, and hypertext are hardly realized in the system. This is not surprising, since China just started developing PHERIS and the system is still relatively rudimentary. At this stage, China's effort in developing PHERIS can be considered to be successful because of the radical emergency response process change re-sulted from PHERIS and its associated performance improvement in public health surveillance and group co-ordination. China expects PHERIS to be an adaptable system which is able to adjust to the changing environment. Thus, PHERIS will play a significant role in protecting China's public health for years to come. In summary, this article contributes to the IS literature with a description of China's PHERIS development and should be beneficial to both IS researchers and practitioners, especially those who are interested in developing countries' public health emergency response information systems.",
