Seven different norovirus genogroups have been described for the norovirus genus (1) that can be further subdivided in \u224830 genotypes. Noroviruses comprise a single-strand positive-sense RNA genome that is divided into 3 open reading frames (ORFs). Recombination among different genotypes is frequently observed for human noroviruses, most commonly near the junction of ORF1 and ORF2, leading to a recommendation for multilocus genotyping (5) . Surprisingly, recombinant human noroviruses regularly contain previously undetected ORF1 sequences, which raises questions about the reservoirs of these viruses.",

Important clinical signs at the rehabilitation center were anorexia, labored breathing, and disorientation. The animal showed no evidence of gastrointestinal disease, such as vomiting or diarrhea. Eight days after arrival in the rehabilitation center, the animal was euthanized because of the severity of clinical signs, and necropsy was performed according to standard procedures (8) . The main pathology findings were bronchopneumonia associated with lungworm infection and encephalitis and hepatitis of unknown cause. The intestine did not show significant lesions macroscopically; microscopically, the enterocytes at the luminal surface of the intestine had sloughed into the lumen as a result of freeze-thaw artifact. The cells lining the intestinal crypts consisted of a mixture of enterocytes and mucus cells. The proportion of mucus cells increased progressively toward the end of the intestine. The lamina propria was infiltrated diffusely with a moderate number of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. This infiltrate was considered normal for this species.",

These oysters had been sampled because they were associated with a foodborne gastroenteritis outbreak in Ireland in 2012 (15) . Oyster samples were collected from the restaurant where the outbreak occurred and from their harvesting area. Strains belonging to genotypes GI.1, GI.4, GII.4, GII.3, GII.1, GII.6, GI.2, GII.7, GI.11, and the strain that was homologous to HPNV were detected, although the HPNV-like strain was detected only in oysters from the harvesting area. In the patients, only GI.4, GI.2, GI.6, GII.1, and GII.7 strains were detected, but the fact that noroviruses infecting marine mammals closely related to human noroviruses have been found infecting harbor porpoises and contaminating oysters raises the question of whether HPNV could infect humans through contamination of oysters or other shellfish.",

The high genetic diversity within this genus complicates detection of new noroviruses. The discovery of HPNV and the recent discovery of noroviruses in bats highlight that much still remains to be discovered about animal reservoirs of noroviruses and triggers questions about the zoonotic potential of these viruses.
