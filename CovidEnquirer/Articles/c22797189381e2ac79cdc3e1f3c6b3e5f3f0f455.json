This decision was based, presumably, on the clinical similarities between COPD and asthma, and the recognition of the important role that systemic corticosteroids played in reversing the airway inflammation in asthma. However, over time it became clear that the inflammatory processes involved in these 2 diseases were different, and that the clinical effect of glucocorticoids in COPD was much smaller than in asthma. 12 In the largest randomized controlled trial addressing this question (a trial sponsored by the Veterans Administration [VA] published in 1999), 13 271 patients hospitalized for an AECOPD were randomized to receive systemic glucocorticoid treatment or placebo. All were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and bronchodilators. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as 1 of the following: death from any cause, need for intubation/mechanical ventilation, readmission for COPD, or intensification of pharmacologic treatment. The results showed that patients treated with systemic glucocorticoids experienced a lower rate of treatment failure, but this was mostly related to the need for intensification of treatment in the placebo group (mainly adding glucocorticoids). Therefore the benefit of adding systemic corticosteroids early was, primarily, that one would avoid having to add them later. However, the steroid group also had a 1.2-day shorter LOS and a significant improvement in FEV 1 on the day after enrollment, but also had significantly higher rates of hyperglycemia requiring medical therapy, in comparison with the control group. The investigators concluded that glucocorticoids offer a modest benefit in patients hospitalized with COPD, at the cost of significant hyperglycemia in some patients.",

Unfortunately no clinical trials have directly compared the efficacy of high-, medium-, or low-dose regimens. Doses ranging from 30 mg of methylprednisolone daily up to 125 mg of solumedrol every 6 hours (followed by a tapering dose) have shown beneficial effects. 15 ,20 A large observational study (which examined data on almost 80,000 patients) did not find any difference in outcomes (including initiation of mechanical ventilation, mortality, or readmission) in patients treated with high-dose (equivalent to 120-800 mg/d prednisone) versus low-dose (equivalent to 20-80 mg/d prednisone) glucocorticoids for the first 2 days of admission. 21 These data suggest that very high initial doses of glucocorticoids are not advantageous, but the optimal dosing of glucocorticoids in AECOPD remains uncertain. The GOLD guidelines recommend 30 to 40 mg of oral prednisolone daily. 1 Optimal duration of treatment is also unknown based on the available evidence. The VA study (discussed earlier) compared a 2-week course of treatment with an 8-week course of treatment, and found no benefit with the longer course. A small study of hospitalized patients demonstrated that a 10-day course of glucocorticoids resulted in better improvements in spirometric measurement, dyspnea on exertion, and PaCO 2 levels than did a 3-day course. 22 A Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis was able to identify only 4 studies that compared the duration of corticosteroid treatment in AECOPD, 2 of which were only published as abstracts.",

In addition, many hospitalized patients are treated with nicotine replacement therapy to curb the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Therefore, hospitalization is a perfect opportunity to encourage smoking cessation. A systematic review of studies of smoking cessation in hospitalized patients from 2008 demonstrated that counseling interventions in the hospital did result in improved cessation rates at 6 and 12 months (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.44-1.9), but only if the intervention continued (as phone or face-toface contacts) for more than a month after discharge. 78 Counseling efforts that were limited to the hospital stay, or persisted for less than 1 month after discharge, did not appear to improve cessation rates. This review also found that nicotine replacement therapy, when added to counseling, resulted in a trend toward improved cessation rates (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.92-2.35).",

However, some of these patients who are discharged with home oxygen therapy after an AECOPD will have improved oxygenation as they recover from the acute illness, and will be able to eventually discontinue oxygen therapy. Reassessment of a patient's oxygen status is one important goal of the follow-up appointment already discussed. It is also worth noting that patients who use long-term oxygen therapy chronically (ie, they are using it at the time of admission) should generally continue that therapy after discharge, even if they appear not to meet criteria for it at the time of discharge. It is thought that long-term oxygen therapy may have a reparative effect over time in patients with chronic hypoxemia that leads to augmented oxygenation, which may be undone by discontinuing the oxygen therapy. 9 Should hospitalists refer patients to pulmonary rehabilitation programs after hospitalizations for AECOPD?",

These programs include multiple interventions (which might include strength and endurance training, breathing exercises, smoking cessation, education, psychosocial interventions, and so forth), but a core part of this treatment involves training the muscles of ambulation. These programs decrease dyspnea, improve quality of life, and decrease hospitalization in COPD patients. 85 Several studies have looked at the value of pulmonary rehabilitation, specifically in the context of an AECOPD. A Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis of 9 studies of pulmonary rehabilitation after AECOPD (not all requiring hospitalization) demonstrated significant reduction in rates of hospitalization and death in those patients randomized to early pulmonary rehabilitation. Some quality-of-life measures were also improved in this group. 86 Most of these studies started the rehabilitation within 10 days of discharge for those patients who were hospitalized, and the mean FEV 1 was less than 40% predicted in most studies (range, 32%-52% predicted). Individually the studies in this meta-analysis were small and of modest methodologic quality, but taken together the findings are compelling.",
