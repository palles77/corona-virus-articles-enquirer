The isolated yield is 51%. General procedure for the synthesis of compounds 11-15: Compound 6-10 (500 mg) was dissolved in THF (10 mL) and stirred in an ice bath. Aqueous LiOH (1 M, 1 mL) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 0.5 h. Additional aqueous LiOH was added if the TLC analysis showed the presence of the unreacted ester. Upon completion of the reaction, THF was evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The reaction mixture was then acidified by aqueous HCl (1 M) in an ice bath until the pH reaches 2-3. The obtained precipitate was filtered by a Bu\u0308chner funnel, washed with cold water and stored under vacuum in a desiccator. In the case where no precipitate was formed during acidification, the reaction mixture was extracted by 5% MeOH in DCM. The removal of organic solvents under reduced pressure yielded the respective product as a foamy solid.",

The incubation buffer contains 10 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 (a-b), or 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5 (c-d).(a-d) The loaded samples contain 0.25 \uf06dM rHP1 in 25 \uf06dL. The PNA concentrations in lanes from left to right are 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1, 2, 4, 10 and 20 \uf06dM, respectively. The data shown in panels a and b suggest that lowering the NaCl concentration from 200 to 10 mM results in the stabilization of PNA\u2022dsRNA triplex, but no strand invasion complex formation. The data shown in panels c and d suggest that addition of 2 mM MgCl2 results in the destabilization of PNA\u2022dsRNA triplexes. However, PNA BU-3,5 still shows a relatively tight binding even in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2 (Kd values of 0.9 \u00b5M with 2 mM MgCl2 versus 0.3 \u00b5M without 2 mM MgCl2 (see Figure 3i)). (e) rHP1 (lanes 1-6) and dHP1 (lanes 7-12) loaded are at 1 \uf06dM in 20 \uf06dL and 10 \uf06dL, respectively. The incubation buffer is 0.5 mM EDTA, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl (lane 1-3, 7-9) or 10 mM NaCl (lane 4-6, 10-12).

The slow migrating bands shown in lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6 indicate the PNA\u2022dsRNA triplex formation. No PNA\u2022dsDNA triplex was observed. The relatively slow-moving and faint bands observed in lanes 11 and 12 indicate the formation of strand invasion complexes between PNA and dHP1. 5. CD spectra CD characterization of PNA binding to RNAs. The incubation buffer contains 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The RNA concentration is kept at 2 \uf06dM in 100 \uf06dL. The PNA concentrations are 4 \uf06dM (a), 20 \uf06dM (b), and 4\uf06dM (c), respectively. (a,b) Binding to model RNA hairpins and miR-198 RNA hairpin. No helicity is observed for PNAs P1 and BU-3,5 (see panel a). The red shift of the peak at around 270 nm upon the binding of PNAs suggests the PNA\u2022rHP1 and PNA\u2022miR-198 hairpin triplex formation. No clear red shift was observed for the control BU-3,5 + rHP2 compared to rHP2 alone. rHP2 has the G9-C24 pair in rHP1 replaced with a C-G pair and does not bind to BU-3,5 (Data not shown).
