RNA pseudoknots are also of interest because of their key role in the control of ribosomal frameshifting by viral RNAs. Their mechanical properties are directly relevant to their unfolding by ribosomes during translation. We have used optical tweezers to study the kinetics and thermodynamics of mechanical unfolding and refolding of single RNA molecules. Here we describe the unfolding of the frameshifting pseudoknot from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three constituent hairpins, and three mutants of the IBV pseudoknot. All four pseudoknots cause \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. We have measured the free energies and rates of mechanical unfolding and refolding of the four frameshifting pseudoknots. Our results show that the IBV pseudoknot requires a higher force than its corresponding hairpins to unfold. Furthermore, its rate of unfolding changes little with increasing force, in contrast with the rate of hairpin unfolding. The presence of Mg 2+ significantly increases the kinetic barriers to unfolding the IBV pseudoknot, but has only a minor effect on the hairpin unfolding. The greater mechanical stability of pseudoknots compared to hairpins, and their kinetic insensitivity to force supports the hypothesis that \u22121 frameshifting depends on the difficulty of unfolding the mRNA.",

            "text": "The pseudoknot is a simple tertiary structure motif found in a wide range of RNA molecules; because of their structure, pseudoknots can give insight into how tertiary and secondary RNA structures contribute to the stability and kinetics of folding. Among the many different types of pseudoknots classified by their topology, the most common is the H-type pseudoknot. 1 The H-type pseudoknot consists of a hairpin stem (stem 1) with a second stem formed by the downstream region that base-pairs with the loop of stem 1. H-type pseudoknots are found in many kinds of RNA molecules including messenger RNA, 2 ribosomal RNA, 3 transfer-messenger RNA, 4 catalytic self-splicing RNA 5, 6 and viral genomic RNA. 7 While RNA pseudoknots often serve as structural elements helping to stabilize complex three-dimensional structures, they also perform an active role as essential elements in the regulation of several biological processes. Deletion of key pseudoknots can disrupt activity in telomerase 8, 9 and catalytic ribozymes. [10] [11] [12] [13] Pseudoknots also play a role in initiation of internal ribosome entry translation, 14, 15 binding of ribosomal proteins to RNA, [16] [17] [18] and controlling the translational frame during protein synthesis. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] We focus on frameshifting mRNA pseudoknots that are involved in translational control of viral proteins via \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121 PRF). Here, we characterize the mechanical unfolding and refolding of the pseudoknot that stimulates \u22121 PRF in the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three mutant pseudoknots that also stimulate \u22121 PRF, and three related hairpin molecules with the same stems but lacking the tertiary base-pairing of their related pseudoknots. Our goal is to evaluate the nature of tertiary interactions in RNA and to gain insight into the mechanism of frameshifting by these pseudoknots.",

            "text": "Currently, it is possible to predict secondary structure from a nucleic acid sequence based on experimentally derived thermodynamic values. 25, 26 However, the goal of predicting tertiary structure from an RNA sequence has yet to be achieved. To meet this goal, a better understanding of the contributions of tertiary interactions to RNA stability and folding kinetics is crucial. Comparison of the folding and unfolding characteristics of an RNA pseudoknot and its corresponding hairpins provides a simple system for quantifying the contributions of tertiary interactions. As many in vivo RNA unfolding events are accomplished by molecular motors that exert force on the RNA, 27 the effects of tertiary structure on the mechanical characteristics of RNA unfolding may have a direct relevance to the biological functions of RNA. Extensive studies on the folding characteristics of pseudoknots and other RNA structures using thermal or chemical denaturation methods have provided much useful information. 23, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] However, mechanical unfolding differs significantly from these methods. Thermal and chemical denaturation act upon an RNA globally, thus, unfolding can begin with any of the base-pairs. In contrast, mechanical force acts locally upon the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of an RNA hairpin; the basepairs of a hairpin unfold sequentially along the stem towards the loop. Furthermore, force applied to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of an RNA will be experienced differently by a secondary structure such as a hairpin, than it will be experienced by a tertiary structure such as a pseudoknot. As illustrated by the arrows indicating direction of force in Figure 1 , a hairpin will experience a localized tensile force whereas a pseudoknot will experience a shearing force across its structure. Mechanical unfolding of RNA, whether carried out in vivo by molecular machines or carried out in vitro by optical tweezers, is influenced by tertiary interactions in a manner that is not revealed by thermal and chemical unfolding. Thus, mechanical unfolding and refolding of the tertiary conformations of RNA can provide insight relevant to in vivo biological processes.",

This process regulates protein levels in various viruses including IBV, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] ) and is crucial for viral rep-lication.

The downstream structure is most often a pseudoknot. 21 The frameshifting efficiency shows a wide range of variability among pseudoknots; alterations in the structure of the pseudoknot can substantially affect this frameshifting efficiency. Previous studies have established that the thermodynamic stability is not correlated with frameshifting efficiency. 37, 38 Though a recent paper reporting on the mechanical unfolding of two mutant pseudoknots presents data that suggest the magnitude of the average unfolding force may be correlated with frameshifting efficiency, 39 it is clear that the regulation of ribosomal frameshifting is not simply a matter of thermodynamics. It has been proposed that the kinetics of unfolding may dictate frameshifting efficiency, 23 and in particular, the kinetics of unfolding along a mechanical reaction coordinate, but these properties have not been characterized for frameshifting pseudoknots until now.",

The possibility that \u22121 PRF is dependent on the mechanical tension induced by a folded pseudoknot was a fundamental component of the torsional restraint model 36 and this hypothesis was recently further strengthened by cryo-electron microscopic imaging of eukaryotic ribosomes complexed with mRNA containing a frameshifting pseudoknot. 40 Accordingly, using mechanical force to unfold and refold individual pseudoknots can provide useful insight into the role that the mechanical properties of pseudoknots play in the frameshifting process.

The force-extension curves of pIBV at various pulling rates are shown in Figure 3 . To characterize the role of Mg 2+ in the unfolding and refolding of pIBV, force-ramp experiments were done in the presence and absence of Mg 2+ . As shown in Figure 3 (a), in 5 mM MgCl 2 , pIBV shows a single unfolding transition with an average length of 16(\u00b11.5) nm (Table 1) . This indicates that in the presence of Mg 2+ , pIBV unfolds through rupturing of one compact conformation rather than the sequential unfolding of two constituent stems. The curves are reasonably well aligned with two calculated curves of the WLC model based on the folded and unfolded pseudoknot conformations. The average unfolding force and the distribution of unfolding forces both show a strong dependence on the pulling rate. The molecule unfolds at a high force range at fast pulling rates (around 31 pN at 10 pN s \u22121 ) with a wide distribution of unfolding forces (SD, 3.8 pN), whereas it unfolds around 26 pN at 3 pN s \u22121 with a narrower distribution (SD, 2.9 pN). As shown in Figure 3 (a), the pIBV pulling curves show a large hysteresis between . Force-extension curves of the IBV pseudoknot (pIBV). One representative force-extension curve at three different pulling rates is shown (a) in the presence of Mg 2+ and (b) in the absence of Mg 2+ . The unfolding curves are in magenta, the refolding curves are in dark green. For each curve, the x axis is the molecular end-toend distance between two beads (nm) and the y axis is the pulling force that is exerted on each RNA construct (pN). Each force extension curve was aligned with a theoretically calculated (worm-like-chain) force-extension curve (two black lines) of the DNA-RNA handles with the corresponding number of its single-stranded nucleotides. The left side curve is for the DNA-RNA handles with a folded RNA and the right side curve is for the DNA-RNA handles with an unfolded RNA. Average unfolding forces and refolding forces with standard deviations are listed. The numbers in parentheses are the number of force-extension curves used to calculate each average unfolding and refolding force. unfolding and refolding transitions even at the slowest pulling rate.

The number in parentheses is the total number of pulling curves used for calculating average unfolding and refolding forces. 19 .0 \u00b1 0.9 14.9 \u00b1 1.1 18.2 \u00b1 0.8 15.1 \u00b1 1.1 11 \u00b1 1.1 10 \u00b1 1.1 15.9 \u00b1 0.8 12.9 \u00b1 1.1 15.2 \u00b1 0.5 13.6 \u00b1 0.6 10 \u00b1 1.1 9 \u00b1 0.9 hpS2 (28-84 a ) 15.7 \u00b1 1.4 N/A b 14.6 \u00b1 1.5 7.9 \u00b1 1.2 c 10 \u00b1 2.0 6 \u00b1 0.9 11.4 \u00b1 1.2 8.3 \u00b1 0.4 d 9.6 \u00b1 0.9 7.2 \u00b1 0.8 e 10 \u00b1 1. 4 very similar to the sequence of the corresponding nucleotides in pIBV but varies in the identity of four nucleotides in order to prevent hpS2 from forming a pseudoknot. The unfolding of hpS2 is a single rip of approximately 10 nm, consistent with disrupting the stem. The refolding behavior of hpS2 with its large loop is quite slow; on occasion there is no clear refolding rip (Figure 4(b) ). This indicates that there is a dynamic equilibrium during refolding, which is to be expected in such a short stem. Like hpS1, the distribution of unfolding forces for hpS2 is much narrower than the distribution of pIBV and its unfolding force does not show appreciable dependence on the pulling rate. In the absence of Mg 2+ , hpS2 unfolds at very low force (10-11 pN). Yet, its unfolding force increases significantly in the presence of Mg 2+ (15-16 pN) . Overall, the unfolding and refolding characteristics of pIBV are drastically different from the hpS1 and hpS2 hairpins in the presence of Mg 2+ . These results indicate that in Mg 2+ the pIBV construct folds into a pseudoknot rather than partially folded conformations similar to hpS1 or hpS2.",

Unlike pIBV, at moderately slow pulling rates (5 pN s \u22121 or slower), hpS12 displays a reversible transition in its unfolding and refolding processes, which is evidenced by the lack of hysteresis and appearance of \"hopping\" (Figure 4(c) ). Although the presence of Mg 2+ slightly increased hysteresis at a fast pulling rate (10 pN s \u22121 ), hpS12 shows reversible unfolding and refolding both in Mg 2+ and in EDTA. The ability of hpS12 to unfold and refold reversibly in the presence of Mg 2+ indicates that Mg 2+ does not slow its unfolding and refolding kinetics. This is in direct contrast with pIBV, which shows hysteresis in all conditions and significant hysteresis in the presence of Mg 2+ . The hysteresis indicates that, in the presence of Mg 2+ , the IBV pseudoknot conformation provides a stronger kinetic barrier to unfolding than its corresponding hairpin loop.",

            "text": "Constant force experiments are of two types, hopping and force-jump. During hopping experiments, an RNA molecule is held at a constant force at which both unfolding and refolding transitions can be observed in an experimentally accessible time scale. 41, 42, 51 However, hopping experiments can only access forces near the equilibrium; for many molecules the range of forces is too narrow for the collection of data across a significant range of forces. To perform constant force experiments across a wider range of forces the force-jump method can be used instead. A diagram of a force-jump experiment is shown in Figure 7 . The cycle begins at low force with the molecule in its folded conformation. Next, the force is rapidly increased to a value at which the molecule will unfold within an experimentally accessible time scale. Simultaneously, the stretching of the RNA/DNA hybrid handles resulting from the sudden force increase produces an increase in extension (\u0394X) of the molecular tether. The new imposed force is held constant until an increase in extension due to the unfolding of the molecule occurs. Once unfolding has been observed, force is ramped higher to ensure that complete unfolding of the molecule has indeed occurred. After this second force increase, a gradual increase in extension occurs because of further stretching of the handles. Next the force is rapidly decreased to a value at which the molecule will refold on an experimentally accessible time scale and finally ramped to a lower value to ensure complete refolding of the molecule before the cycle is repeated. 51 Data from constant force experiments are represented by plots of extension versus time (Figure 8 ). The measured sizes of the folded to unfolded transitions at 21-24 pN force are in the range of 10 nm-15 nm (for details, see Table 3 ). Based on the known structures of other pseudoknots [59] [60] [61] we estimate that the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 distances of the folded pseudoknots to be approximately: 6(\u00b11) nm. The lengths of single-stranded RNA were calculated Negative work, P R (\u2212W) were plotted for refolding. Statistics: For Mg 2+ , 148 curves, three molecules (r = 4 pNs \u22121 ), 152 curves, two molecules (r = 10 pNs \u22121 ). For EDTA, 68 curves, one molecule (r = 3 pNs \u22121 ), 78 curves, one molecule (r = 6 pNs \u22121 ), 68 curves, one molecule (r = 10 pNs \u22121 ). Work values were binned into eight to 12 equally spaced intervals. Unfolding and refolding distributions at different pulling rates show similar crossing points (circled in black) that reasonably match with one another (194(\u00b12.1) k B T for Mg 2+ , 108(\u00b11.5) k B T for EDTA). from the WLC model. In the 21pN-24 pN force range, the conversion factor is 0.46 nm per nucleotide and leads to calculated changes in extension of: 11-14 nm (Table 3) , which are in reasonable agreement with the measured changes in extension.",

For pIBV, the data from force ramp as well as constant force experiments give no evidence of detectable intermediates, indicating a single-step transition between a folded state and unfolded state. However, as shown in Figure 8 , an IBV mutant pseudoknot, pKA13, infrequently (about 10% of the trajectories in the 23 pN-25 pN unfolding force and 21 pN-23 pN refolding force range) shows two-step unfolding/refolding processes revealing the presence of a distinct intermediate in the constant-force experiments. This observation is consistent with the observation of two-step transitions in the forceextension curves of pKA13 at slow pulling rates (data not shown). These results indicate that pKA13 goes through a detectable, partially folded intermediate state during its unfolding and refolding. Evidence of intermediate states was present, but less frequent in pKA18 data and rare in pKA9 data. The molecular explanation for this difference in the folding pathways of the four pseudoknots is unclear. We report the observation of these intermediates without speculation on their significance, and with hopes that it may prove useful to future work on RNA folding. Though the presence of intermediates was observed, to a varying degree, in the three mutant pseudoknots, overall a one-step transition without intermediate states is the most dominant transition pattern for all three IBV mutant pseudoknots.",

            "text": "Here, we investigated the mechanical characteristics of the IBV pseudoknot in comparison with its related hairpins in order to gain insight into the contributions of tertiary interactions to RNA folding kinetics and thermodynamics. The most significant differences between the RNA pseudoknot and the corresponding RNA hairpins were: (1) Mg 2+ is crucial to the tertiary interactions that stabilize the pseudoknot conformation, but has minimal effect on the hairpins; (2) the pseudoknot requires higher force to unfold than the hairpin with the same basepairs; (3) the thermodynamic stabilities of the pseudoknot and hairpin are similar, but the kinetics of unfolding is much slower for the pseudoknot. The thermodynamic stability of the hairpin hpS12 predicted by Mfold 26,58 is 37 kcal mol \u22121 in 1 M NaCl at 21\u00b0C. The calculated thermodynamic stability of pIBV (as described above) was 35 kcal mol \u22121 . As pIBV and hpS12 have the same base-pairs (Figure 1 ), we expect them to have similar calculated thermal stabilities. Our force-ramp data (in 20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 ) give the free energy change at zero force, \u0394G 0 , of 37(\u00b13) kcal mol \u22121 for the unfolding of pIBV and 34(\u00b13) kcal mol \u22121 for the unfolding of hpS12. These results are consistent with our expectations. However, in the presence of Mg 2+ , the average unfolding force of pIBV is significantly higher than that of hpS12 at all pulling rates ( Table 1 ). The mechanical unfolding of pIBV is a kinetically controlled process, except at extremely Figure 9 . Natural log of rate constants versus unfolding and refolding force. Natural log of the rate constants for unfolding ( \u25aa ) and refolding (\u25b4) plotted against force for pIBV (a), pKA18 (b), pKA13 (c) and pKA9 (d). The linear fits of the unfolding data (dotted lines) and of the refolding data (broken lines) intersect at the critical force. The lines are described by equation (6): ln k = F(\u0394X \u2021 /k B T) + ln k 0 where k is the rate constant, F is the force, \u0394X \u2021 is the distance to transition state, k B is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and k 0 is the apparent rate constant at zero force. Values for \u0394X \u2021 obtained from these equations are listed for the unfolding and refolding transitions of the four pseudoknots. Data were obtained in pH 7.5 buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl and 5 mM MgCl 2 .",

The pseudoknot is brittle (short distance from its folded state to its transition state), whereas the secondary structure is compliant (larger distance from its folded state to its transition state). The short distance to the transition state characterizes the fact that the pseudoknot unfolds over a wide range of forces. The standard deviation of the average unfolding force distribution is noticeably larger for pIBV than it is for the corresponding hairpin; the unfolding rate coefficient of pIBV also changes much more slowly with a change in the unfolding force compared with hpS12. The distance to the transition state of hpS12 for both unfolding and refolding is large (\u223c12 nm), which is consistent with earlier studies of RNA hairpins. 41 ",

Pseudoknots unfold at higher forces than hairpins, and their rates of unfolding increase much less with increasing force. Do these characteristics provide insight into the role of pseudoknots in -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting? Yes. We propose that the slow unfolding of a pseudoknot compared to a hairpin, even as the ribosome applies increasing force, favors frameshifting. Do the characteristics of the mechanical unfolding of the mutant pseudoknots explain their relative frameshifting efficiency? No. We found no general correlation between mechanical properties, such as distance to the transition state for unfolding, and the variation in frameshifting efficiency (2%-46%). Chemical properties not mirrored in the mechanical characteristics must also be important. We did see that near 24 pN the frequency with which the pseudoknots induce frameshifting is inversely proportional to their rate constants of unfolding (Table 4 ). Though the correlation is only present over a very narrow range of forces it may prove to have some significance once the mechanochemistry of the ribosome is characterized.",

The plasmid was replicated by the bacteria and a DNA template for RNA transcription was removed from the plasmid by enzymatic digestion resulting in a template corresponding to the RNA sequence of the appropriate molecule plus approximately 500 DNA base-pairs on each side that correspond to the RNA sequence of the handle regions. The template was recovered by miniprep (Qiagen) and sequenced by the University of California Berkeley (UCB) sequencing facility. The DNA template was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) containing a T7 promoter sequence at the 5\u2032 end, and sequenced by the UCB sequencing facility. RNA molecules were transcribed from the DNA templates by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion). The RNA was prepared as an optical tweezers construct by annealing the DNA handles to the single-stranded RNA handle regions. DNA handle A (pBR322 bases 3821 to 3) was amplified by PCR and then biotinylated at the 3\u2032 end using an exchange reaction by T4 DNA polymerase. The downstream primer used for PCR amplification of DNA handle B (pBR322 bases 30 to 628) was modified to have a terminal digoxigenin group. The biotin and digoxigenin allowed the RNA-DNA handles flanking the RNA sequence to be attached to a streptavidin coated polystyrene bead (Spherotech) and an anti-digoxigenin coated polystyrene bead (Spherotech).

For hpS2, both Mg 2+ and EDTA conditions show two distinct refolding patterns, one of which shows very slow refolding and often results in no recognizable zip. For hpS1 and hpS2, the red curve represents a theoretical curve for a double-stranded handle with fully folded pseudoknot conformation. As expected from the formation of a partially folded pseudoknot in the hpS1 and hpS2 constructs, their pulling curves were aligned well with a theoretical curve for the handles with a partially folded pseudoknot (the middle black curve). As for hpS12, the stack of five representative curves wasaligned with the theoretical curve based on the completely folded hairpin at low force regime and a completely unfolded hairpin (the addition of 38 nt in the single-stranded RNA sequence) at high force regime. For all curves, the pulling rate is 4-5 pN s \u22121 . The unfolding curves are in magenta, the refolding curves are in dark green.

            "text": "All experiments were performed on a dual-beam optical tweezers instrument 65 in an ambient temperature of 20-22\u00b0C. Force-ramp experiments were performed in either magnesium buffer (20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 (pH 7.5)) or EDTA buffer (20 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 7.5)). RNA constructs were pulled at forces ranging between 2 pN and 35 pN at loading rates of 2 pN s \u22121 to 20 pN s \u22121 . Constant force experiments were performed in 20 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 (pH 7.5). RNA constructs were subjected to forces of 3 pN-40 pN, with incubation forces (forces used to observe unfolding and/or refolding) of 17 pN-26 pN. Constant force data were collected at 100-200 Hz.All experiments positioned the RNA constructs in the optical tweezers in the following manner. Streptavidincoated beads of approximately 2 \u03bcm were added to a microfluidic chamber filled with the appropriate buffer. A streptavidin bead was caught in the laser trap and then transferred to a micropipette attached to a piezoelectric stage. The RNA constructs were incubated with antidigoxigenin coated beads of approximately 3 \u03bcm in the same buffer and then added to the microfluidic chamber. An anti-digoxigenin bead was caught in the laser trap and the streptavidin micropipette bead was moved near the anti-digoxigenin trap bead. The micropipette bead repeatedly approached the trap bead until a biotin-streptavidin connection was made, resulting in an RNA tether holding both beads together. Force was exerted on the molecule by moving the micropipette relative to the laser trap. The force on the bead in the trap, and therefore the force on the molecule held between the two beads, was determined from the change in the momentum of the laser light as it passed through the trap. 65 The change in extension of the RNA was measured from the change in position of the beads. 65 ",
