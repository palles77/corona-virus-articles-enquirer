This will be similar in some respects to the Global TB Drug Facility whose creation I oversaw when I directed WHO's tuberculosis programme. The service will help countries and implementers to navigate drug purchasing and financing while considering best prices and ensuring quality, thus helping to overcome one of the greatest barriers faced by countries in HIV/AIDS treatment scale-up.",

As we strengthen our cooperation with countries, WHO, UNAIDS, and the Global Fund must also coordinate with other multilateral institutions, including the World Bank's Multi-country HIV/AIDS Program, with bilateral treatment initiatives, such as the US Presidential HIV/AIDS initiative, and with private foundations.

As antiretrovirals become more widely available, monitoring and responding to drug resistance will be a key responsibility. For more than a year after the 3 by 5 target was first widely publicised, at the July, 2002, International AIDS Conference in Barcelona, enrolment of patients into treatment was slow. To many, perhaps, the obstacles seemed too daunting and the risks too great. Now WHO and its partners are breaking the inertia and facing the risks. The alternative-to watch millions more human beings die when therapies exist to treat them-is simply unacceptable. With determined action by all partners, the 3 by 5 objective can be reached. If the 34 countries with the highest rates of HIV infection each provided antiretroviral treatment to 50% of those who need it by the end of 2005, 92% of the target would be attained.",

The report emphasises both the broad ethical commitment to equity which grounds a system based on primary health care and such a system's integrated service structure-\"principled, integrated care\". From a systems perspective, the potential conflict between primary health care as a discrete level of care and as an overall approach to responsive, equitable health-service provision can be reconciled. 1 The political, socioeconomic, and epidemiological contexts of primary health care have changed dramatically in a quarter of a century. Yet these changes render the fundamental ethical commitments of Health For All more important than ever. WHO reaffirms the aims and values of Health For All and will work with countries to develop health systems strategies for translating these values into sustained action. The way to Health For All is through strengthening of health systems. Panel 1 shows the aims of a health system based on primary health care.",

The country's current health sector reform is explicitly based on primary health care and a pro-equity orientation. Reform measures aim to equip primary care establishments throughout the country as family and community health centres (centros de salud familiar y comunitaria) able to bring complete, integrated care within reach of the whole population. Innovative measures to promote equitable access for marginalised and vulnerable groups have been built in-for example through outreach programmes aimed at rural and indigenous populations. Epidemiological data on usage patterns have been used to redistribute staff and other resources at health facilities to provide more efficient service to vulnerable groups (such as children and older adults), reduce waiting times during peak usage periods, and increase client satisfaction. 18 In 2000, 265 health centres (consultorios) extended their opening hours to better meet client demands, enabling a 23% increase in the number of patients seen. By the following year, a total of 483 publicsector health-facilities had adopted the same system. In 2000, 550 primary-care facilities throughout the country improved their responsiveness through measures including remodelling of reception and clinical spaces, introduction of priority service windows, extended opening hours, and prioritisation of clients based on clinical criteria rather than order of arrival. These measures enabled 97% of the facilities to eliminate early morning waiting lines (http://www.minsal.cl). Chile's health sector reform has been combined with decentralisation and has generated a model of local network management (gestion en red) that gives increased autonomy to closely integrated local networks of primary care centres and referral facilities. These locally networked facilities coordinate their activities to achieve service improvements such as minimising the length of time patients must wait for referral appointments. Strong commitment from the country's political leadership has accelerated the reform process. Recently passed legislation guarantees universal access to treatment for 56 conditions which together account for 80% of Chile's mortality. The law stipulates that a patient's total annual copayment will not exceed 20% of the cost of services, nor surpass the equivalent of 1 month's family income (http://www.minsal.cl).",
