The fear and anxiety that arise with the occurrence of any infectious disease are even greater in the situation of the breastfeeding mother-infant dyad. Uncertainty and lack of knowledge often lead to proscribing against breastfeeding out of fear, which then deprives the infant of the potential protective, nutritional, and emotional benefits of breastfeeding exactly at the time when they are most needed (see the dynamic nature of immunologic benefit, Chapter 5). Decisions concerning breastfeeding in the mother with an infectious illness should balance the potential benefits of breastfeeding versus the known or estimated risk of the infant acquiring a clinically significant infection via breastfeeding and the potential severity of the infection.",

Isolation or identification of the infectious agent from the colostrum, breast milk, or an infectious lesion of the breast is important but not necessarily proof of transmission to the infant. Epidemiologic evidence of transmission must be considered, including identifying characteristics of the organism that relate an isolate from the infant to the maternal isolate. Infectious organisms can reach the breast milk either by secretion in the fluid or cellular components of breast milk or by contamination of the milk at the time of or after expression.

Many situations carry the risk of transmission of the involved organism from the mother to the infant, or vice versa; in general, however, the infant is at greater risk because of such factors as inoculum size and immature immune response. As always, the infection must be accurately diagnosed in a timely manner. Empiric therapy and initial infection control precautions should begin promptly, based on the clinical syndrome and the most likely etiologic agents. When dealing with a maternal infection, clarifying the possible modes of transmission and estimating the relative risk of transmission to the infant are essential first steps to decision making concerning the issues of isolating the mother from the infant and the appropriateness of continuing breastfeeding or providing expressed breast milk. Breastfeeding infrequently is contraindicated in specific maternal infections. Often the question of isolation and interruption of breastfeeding arises when symptoms of fever, pain, inflammation, or other manifestations of illness first develop in the mother and the diagnosis is still in doubt. A clinical judgment must be made as to the site of infection, probable organisms involved, possible or actual mechanisms of transmission of these organisms to the infant, estimated virulence of the organism, and likely susceptibility of the infant. Additionally, by the time the illness is clearly recognized or diagnosed in the mother, the infant has already been exposed. Given the dynamic nature of the immunologic benefits of breast milk, continuation of breastfeeding at the time of diagnosis or illness in the mother can provide the infant protection rather than continued exposure in most illnesses. Rarely is stopping breastfeeding necessary. Many situations associated with maternal fever do not require separation of the mother and infant, such as engorgement of the breasts, atelectasis, localized nonsuppurative phlebitis, or urinary tract infection (UTI).",

Infant botulism is distinguished from food-borne botulism from improperly preserved food containing the toxin and from wound botulism from spores entering the wound. Infant botulism occurs when the spores of Clostridium botulinum germinate and multiply in the gut and produce the botulinal toxin in the gastrointestinal tract. 14 The toxin binds presynaptically at the neuromuscular junction, preventing acetylcholine release. The clinical picture is a descending, symmetric flaccid paralysis. Not every individual who has C. botulinum identified in the stool experiences a clinical illness. The age of the infant seems to relate to their susceptibility to illness. The illness is mainly in children younger than 12 months of age; the youngest patient described in the literature was 6 days old. Most children become ill between 6 weeks and 6 months of age. The onset of illness seems to occur earlier in formula fed infants compared with breastfed infants. When a previously healthy infant under 6 months of age develops constipation, then weakness and difficulty sucking, swallowing, crying, or breathing, botulism is a likely diagnosis.

Feeding solids to formula fed infants minimally changes the gut flora as these organisms already predominate. Although more hospitalized infants have been breastfed, sudden-death victims are younger and have been formula fed, which supports the concept of immunologic protection in the gut of the breastfed infant.",

It can also present as a painless mass or edema of breast. 11. With suspected mastitis or breast lesion caused by TB, even breast milk is contraindicated, until lesion or mastitis heals, usually 2 weeks or more. range of illnesses. Localized infection can be impetigo, cellulitis, or wound infection, and invasive or suppurative disease includes sepsis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, arthritis, and endocarditis. S. aureus requires only a small inoculum (10 to 250 organisms) to produce colonization in the newborn, most often of the nasal mucosa and umbilicus. 132 By the fifth day of life, 40% to 90% of the infants in the nursery will be colonized with S. aureus. 87 The organism is easily transmitted to others from mother, infant, family, or health care personnel through direct contact. Outbreaks in the nursery were common in the past. Mothers, infants, health care workers, and even contaminated, unpasteurized, banked breast milk were sources of infection. 205 Careful use of antibiotics, changes in nursery layout and procedures, standard precautions, and cohorting as needed have decreased the spread of S. aureus in nurseries. Now the occurrence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a more common problem, requiring cohorting and occasionally epidemiologic investigation and careful infection control intervention. Breastfeeding can continue during diagnosis and treatment of closed, minor staphylococcal infection in the mother along with standard precautions. S. aureus is the most common cause of mastitis in lactating women. One case of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSS) was reported by Katzman and Wald 142 in an infant breastfed by a mother with a lesion on her areola that did not respond to ampicillin therapy for 14 days. Subsequently the infant developed conjunctivitis with S. aureus, which produced an exfoliative toxin, and a confluent erythematous rash without mucous membrane involvement or Nikolsky's sign. No attempt to identify the exfoliative toxin in the breast milk was made, and the breast milk was not cultured for S. aureus. The child responded to intravenous (IV) therapy with nafcillin. This emphasizes the importance of evaluating the mother and infant at the time of a suspected infection and the need for continued observation of the infant for evidence of a pyogenic infection or toxin-mediated disease, especially with breast lesions. This case also raises the issue of when and how infants and mothers become colonized with S. aureus and what factors lead to illness and infection in each. Empiric therapy may be indicated depending on the infant's clinical status. For patients with major open lesions caused by S. aureus that cannot be fully contained, with MRSA, or with SSS, the CDC recommends contact precautions in addition to standard precautions for the duration of the illness. The concern is that staphylococci can be easily transmitted, colonization occurs, and potentially serious infection can occur later. With SSS the primary site of infection can be minimal (e.g., conjunctivitis, infection of a circumcision site), but a clinically significant amount of toxin can be produced and lead to severe disease in the infant. However, it seems reasonable that after initiating appropriate antistaphylococcal therapy for the mother for 24 hours, standard precautions and breastfeeding can be continued whether or not mastitis is present. Some individuals recommend bathing the mother and infant once with hexachlorophene to change the skin flora, but this does not address nasal carriage of S. aureus. With the current increasing prevalence of community-acquired MRSA various regimens for eradicating colonization with Staphylococcus have been proposed, although none have been proved highly efficacious in controlled trials. Usually these regimens include systemic therapy with one or two antimicrobial agents to which the organism is sensitive, topical antibiotics to both nares at least twice daily, and intermittent bathing with hexachlorophene or a similar agent. Often simultaneous treatment of all family members is recommended to eradicate colonization in the household. It is uncertain what role pets play in colonization of family members with Staphylococcus aureus. Evaluation of the infant's status at the time of decision making, continued close observation of the infant, and timely empiric therapy as needed in the infant are also appropriate. The mother and infant can room-in together, without contact with other mothers or infants until discharge.",

Illness produced by coagulase-negative staphylococci can be invasive and severe in high-risk neonates, but rarely in mothers. At 2 weeks of age, for infants still in the nursery, S. epidermidis is a frequent colonizing organism at multiple sites, with colonization rates as high as 75% to 100%. Serious infections with coagulase-negative staphylococci (e.g., abscesses, IV line infection, bacteremia/sepsis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis) require IV therapy. Many strains are resistant to penicillin and the semisynthetic penicillins, so sensitivity testing is essential. Empiric or definitive therapy may require treatment with vancomycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, linezolid, or combinations of these for synergistic activity. Transmission of infection in association with breastfeeding appears to be no more common than with bottle feeding. Infection control includes contact and standard precautions, as with S. aureus. Occasionally, during presumed outbreaks, careful epidemiologic surveillance may be required, including cohorting, limiting overcrowding and understaffing, surveillance cultures of infants and nursery personnel, reemphasis of meticulous infection control techniques for all individuals entering the nursery, and rarely, removal of colonized personnel from direct infant contact.",

There are rare reports of reinfection of the infant. Eradication of GBS colonization in the infant or the mother may be difficult with amoxicillin or rifampin. Breastfeeding can continue depending on the infant's ability to feed during GBS disease. Routine culturing of infants or breast milk to detect colonization is not recommended or useful. (See Chapter 16 for management of mastitis in the mother.) A mother or infant colo-nized or infected with GBS should be managed with standard precautions 62 while in the hospital. GBS endometritis in the mother necessitates separation of mother and infant for the first 24 hours of the mother's therapy, but expressed breast milk can be given to the infant during the separation. Timely evaluation of the infant for infection or illness and empiric therapy for GBS in the infant are appropriate until the child has remained well and cultures are subsequently negative at 72 hours. Occasionally, epidemiologic investigation in hospital will utilize culturing to detect a source of late-onset GBS disease in the nursery.

            "text": "Postnatal infection later in infancy occurs via breastfeeding or contact with infected fluids (e.g., saliva, urine) but, again, rarely causes clinical illness in full-term infants. Seroepidemiologic studies have documented transmission of infection in infancy, with higher rates of transmission occurring in daycare centers, especially when the prevalence of CMV in the urine and saliva is high. CMV has been identified in the milk of CMV-seropositive women at varying rates (10% to 85%) using viral cultures or CMV deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (DNA-PCR). 115, 192, 248, 271 CMV is more often identified in the breast milk of seropositive mothers than in vaginal fluids, urine, and saliva. The CMV isolation rate from colostrum is lower than that from mature milk. 115, 247 The reason for the large degree of variability in identification of CMV in breast milk in these studies probably relates to the intermittent nature of reactivation and excretion of the virus, in addition to the variability, frequency, and duration of sampling of breast milk in the different studies. Some authors have hypothesized that the difference in isolation rates between breast milk and other fluids is caused by viral reactivation in cells (leukocytes or monocytes) in the breast leading to \"selective\" excretion in breast milk. 192 Vochem and associates 271 reported that the rate of virolactia was greatest at 3 to 4 weeks post partum, and Yeager and associates 285 reported significant virolactia between 2 and 12 weeks post partum. Antibodies (e.g., secretory IgA) to CMV are present in breast milk, along with various cytokines and other proteins (e.g., lactoferrin). These may influence virus binding to cells, but they do not prevent transmission of infection. 3, 4, 151, 181, 192, 206, 282 Several studies have documented increased rates of postnatal CMV infection in breastfed infants (50% to 69%) compared with bottle fed infants (12% to 27%) observed through the first year of life. 81, 181, 248, 271 In these same studies, fullterm infants who acquired CMV infection postnatally were only rarely mildly symptomatic at the time of seroconversion or documented viral excretion. Also, no evidence of late sequelae from CMV was found in these infants.",

            "text": "Postnatal exposure of susceptible infants to CMV, including premature infants without passively acquired maternal antibodies against CMV, infants born to CMV-seronegative mothers, and immunodeficient infants, can cause significant clinical illness (pneumonitis, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia). 113, 173 In one study of premature infants followed up to 12 months, Vochem and associates 271 found CMV transmission in 17 of 29 infants (59%) exposed to CMV virolactia and breastfed compared with no infants infected of 27 exposed to breast milk without CMV. No infant was given CMV-seropositive donor milk or blood. Five of the 12 infants who developed CMV infection after 2 months of age had mild signs of illness, including transient neutropenia, and only one infant had a short increase in episodes of apnea and a period of thrombocytopenia. Five other premature infants with CMV infection before 2 months of age had acute illness, including sepsis-like symptoms, apnea with bradycardia, hepatitis, leukopenia, and prolonged thrombocytopenia. 271 Exposure of CMV-seronegative or premature infants to CMV-positive milk (donor or natural mother's) should be avoided. 239 Various methods of inactivating CMV in breast milk have been reported, including Holder pasteurization, freezing (\u221220\u02daC for 3 days), and brief high temperature (72\u02daC for 10 seconds). 81, 92, 107, 246, 285 One small, prospective study suggests that freezing breast milk at \u221220\u02daC for 72 hours protects premature infants from CMV infection via breast milk. Sharland and associates reported on 18 premature infants (<32 weeks) who were uninfected at birth and exposed to breast milk from their CMV seropositive mothers. 239 Only one of 18 (5%) infants became positive for CMV at 62 days of life, and this infant was clinically asymptomatic. This transmission rate is considerably lower than others reported in the literature. CMV seronegative and leukocyte-depleted blood products were used routinely. Banked breast milk was pasteurized and stored at \u221220\u02daC for various time periods and maternal expressed breast milk was frozen at \u221220\u02da before use whenever possible. The infants received breast milk for a median of 34 days (range, 11 to 74 days) and they were observed for a median of 67 days (range, 30 to 192 days). Breast milk samples pre-or postfreezing were not analyzed by PCR or culture for the presence of cytomegalovirus. 239 Yasuda and associates reported on 43 preterm infants (median gestational age 31 weeks) demonstrating a peak in CMV DNA copies, detected by a real-time PCR assay, in breast milk at 4 to 6 weeks post partum. Thirty of the 43 infants received CMV DNA-positive breast milk. Three of the 30 had CMV DNA detected in their sera, but none of the three had symptoms suggestive of CMV infection. Much of the breast milk had been stored at \u221220\u02da C before feeding, which the authors propose is the probable reason for less transmission in this cohort. 284 The efficacy of such treatments to prevent CMV infection in premature infants has not been studied prospectively in a randomized control trial.",

PCR and DNA hybridization studies have detected EBV in the cervix and in breast milk. One study, which identified EBV-DNA in breast milk cells in more than 40% of women donating milk to a breast milk bank, demonstrated that only 17% had antibody to EBV (only IgG, no IgM). 139 The question of the timing of EBV infection and the subsequent immune response and clinical disease produced requires continued study. Differences exist among the clinical syndromes manifest at different ages. Infants and young children are asymptomatic, have illness not recognized as related to EBV, or have mild episodes of illness, including fever, lymphadenopathy, rhinitis and cough, hepatosplenomegaly, or rash. Adolescents or young adults who experience primary EBV infection more often demonstrate infectious mononucleosis syndrome or are asymptomatic. CFS is more common in adolescents and young adults. Burkitt's lymphoma, observed primarily in Africa, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, seen in southeast Asia, where primary EBV infection usually occurs in young children, are tumors associated with early EBV infection. 256 These tumors are related to \"chronic\" EBV infection and tend to occur in individuals with persistently high antibody titers to EBV viral capsid antigen and early antigen. The questions of why these tumors occur with much greater frequency in these geographic areas and what cofactors (including altered immune response to infection) may contribute to their development remain unanswered. 17 It also remains unknown to what degree breast milk could be a source of early EBV infection compared with other sources of EBV infection in the infant's environment. Similar to the situation of postnatal transmission of CMV in immunocompetent infants, clinically significant illness rarely is associated with primary EBV infection in infants. More data concerning the pathogenesis of EBVassociated tumors should be obtained before proscribing against breastfeeding is warranted, especially in areas where these tumors are common but the protective benefits of breastfeeding are high. In areas where Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma are uncommon, EBV infection in the mother or infant is not a contraindication to breastfeeding.",

A syndrome of malformations has been carefully described with congenital VZV infection, typically involving limb deformity, skin scarring, and nerve damage, including to the eye and brain. 101 Perinatal infection can lead to severe infection in the infant if maternal rash develops 5 days or less before delivery and within 2 days after delivery. Illness in the infant usually develops before 10 days of age and is believed to be more severe because of the lack of adequate transfer of antibody from the mother during this period and transplacental spread of virus to the fetus and infant during viremia in the mother. Varicella in the mother occurring prior to 5 days before delivery allows sufficient formation and transplacental transfer of antibodies to the infant to ameliorate disease even if the infant is infected with VZV. Mothers who develop varicella rash more than 2 days after delivery are less likely to transfer virus to the infant transplacentally; they pose a risk to the infant from postnatal exposure, which can be diminished by the administration of varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) to the infant. Postnatal transmission is believed to occur through aerosolized virus from skin lesions or the respiratory tract entering the susceptible infant's respiratory tract. Airborne precautions are therefore appropriate in the hospital setting. Infants infected with VZV in utero or in the perinatal period (less than 1 month of age) are more likely to develop zoster (reactivation of latent VZV) during childhood or as young adults. Table 17 -2 summarizes management of varicella in the hospitalized mother or infant. 101 Postnatal varicella from nonmaternal exposure can occur but is generally mild when it develops after 3 weeks of age or when the mother has passed on antibodies against VZV via the placenta. Severe postnatal varicella does occur in premature infants or infants of varicella-susceptible mothers. When the mother's immune status relative to VZV is uncertain and measurement of antibodies to VZV in the mother or infant cannot be performed promptly (less than 72 hours), administration of VZIG to the infant exposed to varicella or zoster in the postnatal period is indicated. Ideally the mother's varicella status should be known before pregnancy, when varicella virus vaccine could be given if indicated.",

Expressed breast milk can be given to the infant if no skin lesions involve the breasts, as soon as the infant has received VZIG. Persons with varicella rash are considered noninfectious when no new vesicles have appeared for 72 hours and all lesions have crusted, usually in 6 to 10 days. Immunocompetent mothers who develop zoster can continue to breastfeed if the lesions do not involve the breast and can be covered, because antibodies against VZV are provided to the infant via the placenta and breast milk and will diminish the severity of disease even if not preventing it. Conservative management in this scenario would include giving the infant VZIG as well (see Table 17 -2).",

Prematurity and stillbirth apparently occur more frequently in mothers who developed paralytic disease versus inapparent infection. 129 Although individual reports of congenital malformations in association with maternal poliomyelitis exist, no epidemiologic data suggest that polioviruses are teratogenic. Also, no evidence indicates that live attenuated vaccine poliovirus given during pregnancy is associated with congenital malformations. 58, 114 Perinatal infection has been noted in several case reports of infants infected in utero several days before birth who had severe disease manifesting with neurologic manifestations (paralysis) but without fever, irritability, or vomiting. Additional case reports of infection acquired postnatally demonstrate illness more consistent with poliomyelitis of childhood. These cases were more severe and involved paralysis, which may represent reporting bias. 58 No data are available concerning the presence of poliovirus in breast milk, although antibodies to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 have been documented. 174 In this era of increasing worldwide poliovirus vaccination, the likelihood of prenatal or perinatal poliovirus infection is decreasing. Maternal susceptibility to poliovirus should be determined before conception and poliovirus vaccine offered to susceptible women. An analysis of the last great epidemic in Italy in 1958 was done using a population-based case-control study. 211 In 114,000 births, 942 infants were reported with paralytic poliomyelitis. A group of matched control subjects was selected from infants admitted to the hospital at the same time. Using the dichotomous variable of never breastfed and partially breastfed, 75 never-breastfed infants were among the cases and 88 among the control group. The authors determined an odds ratio of 4:2, with 95% confidence interval of 1.4 to 14, demonstrating that the risk of paralytic poliomyelitis was higher in infants never breastfed and lowest among those exclusively breastfed. Because by the time the diagnosis of poliomyelitis is made in a breastfeeding mother, the exposure of the infant to poliovirus from maternal secretions has already occurred, and because the breast milk already contains antibodies that may be protective, no reason exists to interrupt breastfeeding. Breastfeeding also does not interfere with successful immunization against poliomyelitis with oral or inactivated poliovirus vaccine. 46 ",

Daughters of breast cancer patients have an increased risk of developing benign and malignant tumors because of their heredity, not because of their breastfeeding history. 180, 184 Unilateral breastfeeding (limited to the right breast) is a custom of Tanka women of the fishing villages of Hong Kong. Ing and associates 133 investigated the question, \"Does the unsuckled breast have an altered risk of cancer?\" They studied breast cancer data from 1958 to 1975. Breast cancer occurred equally in the left and the right breasts. Comparison of patients who had nursed unilaterally with nulliparous patients and with patients who had borne children but not breastfed indicated a highly significantly increased risk of cancer in the unsuckled breast. The authors conclude that in postmenopausal women who have breastfed unilaterally, the risk of cancer is significantly higher in the unsuckled breast. They believed that breastfeeding may help protect the suckled breast against cancer. 133 Others 176 have suggested that Tanka women are ethnically a separate people and that left-sided breast cancer may be related to their genetic pool and not to their breastfeeding habits. No mention has been made of other possible influences, such as the impact of their role as \"fishermen\" or any inherent trauma to the left breast. 207 In 1926, Lane-Claypon 204 stated that the breast that had never lactated was more liable to become cancerous.

Total months of lactation regardless of parity was the discriminator. Regardless of age of first pregnancy and parity, lactation had an independent protective effect against breast cancer in Japanese women. 287 Although breast cancer incidence is influenced by genetics, stress, hormones, and pregnancy, breastfeeding clearly has a protective effect. \"There is a reduction in the risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women who have lactated.

Transmission of HBV is usually through blood or body fluids (stool, semen, saliva, urine, cervical secretions). 62 Vertical transmission either transplacentally or perinatally during delivery has been well described throughout the world. Vertical transmission rates in areas where HBV is endemic (Taiwan and Japan) are very high, whereas transmission to infants from HBV carrier mothers in other areas where HBV carrier rates are low is uncommon. 250 Transmission of HBV to infants occurs in up to 50% of infants when the mother is acutely infected immediately before, during, or soon after pregnancy. 291 Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is found in breast milk, but transmission by this route is not well documented. Beasley and associates 23, 24 demonstrated that although breast milk transmission is possible, seroconversion rates are no different between breastfed and nonbreastfed infants in a long-term follow-up study of 147 HBsAg-positive mothers. Transmission, when it does happen, probably occurs during labor and delivery. The AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases stated in 2003 that \"studies from Taiwan and England have indicated that breastfeeding by HBsAg-positive women does not increase significantly the risk of infection among their infants.\" 62 Screening of all pregnant women for HBV infection is an essential first step to preventing vertical transmission. Universal HBV vaccination at birth and during infancy, along with administration of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) immediately after birth to infants of HBsAg-positive mothers, prevents HBV transmission in more than 95% of cases. Breastfeeding by HBsAg-positive women is not contraindicated, but immediate administration of HBIG and HBV vaccine should occur. Two subsequent doses of vaccine should be given at the appropriate intervals and dosages for the specific HBV vaccine product.

The timing of HCV infection in vertical transmission is also unknown. In utero transmission has been suggested by some studies, 86 whereas intrapartum or postpartum transmission was proposed by Ohto and associates 196 when they documented the absence of HCV-RNA in the cord blood of neonates who later became HCV-RNA positive at 1 to 2 months of age. More recently, Gibb and associates reported two pieces of data supporting the likelihood of intrapartum transmission as the predominant time of vertical transmission: (a) low sensitivity of PCR for HCV RNA testing in the first month of life with a marked increase in sensitivity after that for diagnosing HCV infection in infants and (b) a lower transmission risk for elective cesarean section (without prolonged rupture of membranes) compared with vaginal or emergency cesarean section delivery. 103 The risk of HCV transmission via breast milk is uncertain. Anti-HCV antibody and HCV-RNA has been demonstrated in colostrum and breast milk, although the levels of HCV-RNA in milk did not correlate with the titers of HCV-RNA in serum. 111, 164 Nevertheless, transmission of HCV via breastfeeding (and not in utero, intrapartum, or from other postpartum sources) has not been proved in the small number infants studied. Transmission rates in breastfed and nonbreastfed infants appear to be similar, but various important factors have not been controlled, such as HCV-RNA titers in the mothers, examination of the milk for HCV-RNA, exclusive breastfeeding versus exclusive formula feeding versus partial breastfeeding, and duration of breastfeeding. 103, 164, 170, 183, 185, 197, 290 Zanetti and associates 290 documented the absence of HCV transmission in 94 mother-infant pairs when the mother had only HCV (no HIV) infection and no transmission in 71 mother-infant pairs who breastfed, including 23 infants whose mothers were seropositive for HCV-RNA. Eight infants in that study were infected with HCV, their mothers had both HIV and HCV, and three of these eight infants were infected with both HIV and HCV.

It is, therefore, appropriate to discuss the theoretic risk of breastfeeding in HCV-positive mothers with the mother or parents and to consider proscribing breast milk when appropriate alternative sources of nutrition are available for the infant. HIV infection is a separate contraindication to breastfeeding.

The infection occurs as either an acute coinfection of HBV and HDV or a superinfection of HBV carriers. This \"double\" infection results in more frequent fulminant hepatitis and chronic hepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis. The virus uses its own HBV-RNA (circular, negative-strand RNA) with an antigen, HDAg, surrounded by the surface antigen of HBV, HBsAg. HDV is transmitted in the same way as HBV, especially through the exchange of blood and body fluids. HDV infection is uncommon where the prevalence of HBV is low. In areas where HBV is endemic, the prevalence of HDV is highly variable. HDV is very common in tropical Africa and South America as well as in Greece and Italy but is uncommon in the Far East and in Alaskan Eskimos, despite the endemic occurrence of HBV in these areas. 244 Transmission of HDV has been reported to occur from household contacts and, rarely, through vertical transmission. No data are available on transmission of HDV by breastfeeding. HDV infection can be prevented by blocking infection with HBV; therefore, HBIG and HBV vaccine are the best protection. In addition to HBIG and HBV vaccine administration to the infant of a mother infected with both HBV and HDV, discussion with the mother or parents should include the theoretic risk of HBV and HDV transmission through breastfeeding. As with HBV, once HBIG and HBV vaccine have been given to the infant, the risk of HBV or HDV infection from breastfeeding is negligible. Therefore, breastfeeding after an informed discussion with the parents is acceptable.",

High infection rates have been reported in adolescents and young adults (ages 15 to 40 years).

            "text": "Hepatitis G virus (HGV) has recently been confirmed as a cause of NANBH distinct from hepatitis viruses A through E. Several closely related genomes of HGV, currently named GBV-A, -B, and -C, appear to be related to HCV, the Pestiviruses, and the Flaviviruses. Epidemiologically, HGV is most often associated with transfusion of blood, although studies have identified nontransfusion-related cases. HGV genomic RNA has been detected in some patients with acute and chronic hepatitis and a small number of patients with fulminant hepatits. GBV-C/HGV has also been found in some patients with inflammatory bile duct lesions, but the pathogenicity of this virus is unconfirmed. HGV-RNA has been detected in 1% to 3% of healthy blood donors in the United States. 6 Feucht and associates 88 described maternal-to-infant transmission of HGV in three of nine children. Two of the three mothers were coinfected with HIV and the third with HCV. None of these infants developed signs of liver disease. Neither the timing nor the mode of transmission was clarified. Lin and associates 163 reported no HGV transmission in three mother-infant pairs after cesarean delivery and discussed transplacental spread via blood as the most likely mode of HGV infection in vertical transmission. Wejstal and associates reported on perinatal transmission of HGV to 12 of 16 infants born to HGV viremic mothers, identified by PCR. HGV did not appear to cause hepatitis in the children. 274 Fischler and associates 90 followed eight children born to HGV-positive mothers and found only one to be infected with HGV. That child remained clinically well, while his twin, also born by cesarean delivery and breastfed, remained HGV negative over 3 years of observation. Five of the other six children breastfed for variable periods without evidence of HGV infection. Ohto and associates examined HGV mother-to-infant transmission. Of 2979 pregnant Japanese women who were screened, 32 were identified as positive for GBV-C/HGV RNA by PCR; 26 of 34 infants born to the 32 HGV positive women were shown to be HGV RNA positive. Reportedly, none of the infants demonstrated a clinical picture of hepatitis, although two infants had persistent mild elevations (less than two times normal) of alanine aminotransferase. The viral load in mothers, who transmitted HGV to their infants, was significantly higher than in nontransmitting mothers. Infants delivered by elective cesarean section had a lower rate of infection (3 in 7) compared with infants born by emergency cesarean section (2 of 2) or born vaginally (21 of 25) . In this study, HGV infection in breastfed infants was four times more common than in formula fed infants, but this difference was not statistically significant because only four infants were formula fed. The authors report there was no correlation between infection rate and duration of breastfeeding. Testing of the infants was not done frequently and early enough routinely through the first year of life to determine the timing of infection in these infants. 197 Schr\u00f6ter and associates reported transmission of HGV to 3 of 15 infants born to HGV RNA positive mothers at 1 week of age. None of 15 breast milk samples were positive for GBV-C/HGV RNA, and all of the children who were initially negative for HGV RNA in serum remained negative at follow-up between 1 to 28 months of age. 234 The foregoing data suggest that transmission is more likely to be vertical, prior to, or at delivery rather than via breast feeding. The pathogenicity and the possibility of chronic disease due to HGV infection remain uncertain at this time. Insufficient data are available to make a recommendation concerning breastfeeding by the HGVinfected mother.",

TTV DNA has been detected in infants of TTV-positive and TTV-negative mothers. Ohto and associates reported no TTV DNA was detected in cord blood from 38 infants, and it was detected in only 1 of 14 samples taken at 1 month of age.

In comparisons of the TTV DNA in TTV-positive mothers and their positive infants; 6 of 13 showed high level nucleotide sequence similarity, and 7 of 13 differed by greater than 10%. 198 Schr\u00f6ter and associates reported on TTV DNA in breast milk examined retrospectively.

Twenty-four women who were negative for TTV DNA gave birth to 24 children who were initially negative for TTV DNA and remained negative throughout the observation period (mean 7.5 months, range 1 to 28 months). TTV DNA was detected in 77% of breast milk samples from TTV viremic women and in none of the breast milk samples from TTVnegative women. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatitis found in the 22 children who were observed to be TTV DNA positive during the period of this study. 234 Other authors have reported TTV in breast milk detected by PCR. They describe the absence of TTV DNA in infants at 5 days and 3 months of age, and 4 of 10 infants were positive for TTV DNA at 6 months of age, suggesting the late acquisition of infection via breastfeeding. 135 TT virus is transmitted in utero and is found in breast milk. There is no evidence of clinical hepatitis in infants related to TTV infection, nor is there evidence for a late chronic hepatitis. Given the current available information there is no reason to proscribe breastfeeding by TTV-positive mothers. There is certainly more to be understood concerning the chronic nature of this infection and the possible pathogenesis of liver disease.",

HTLV-I is associated with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and a chronic condition with progressive neuropathy. The progressive neuropathy is called HTLV-I associated myelopathy or tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). 93 Other illnesses have been reported in association with HTLV-I infection including der-matitis, uveitis, arthritis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome in adults, and infective dermatitis and persistent lymphadenitis in children. Transmission of HTLV-I occurs most often through sexual contact, via blood or blood products, and via breast milk. Infrequent transmission does occur in utero or at delivery and with casual or household contact. 187 Seroprevalence generally increases with age and varies widely in different regions and in populations of different backgrounds. In some areas of Japan, seropsitivity can be as high as 12% to 16%, but in South America, Africa, and some Caribbean countries the rates are 2% to 6%. In Latin America seropostive rates can be as high as 10% to 25% among female sex workers or attendees to STD clinics. 108 In blood donors in Europe, the seroprevalence of HTLV-I has been reported at 0.001% to 0.03%. The seroprevalence in pregnant women in endemic areas of Japan is as high as 4% to 5% and in nonendemic areas as low as 0.1% to 1.0%. HTLV-1 is not a major disease in the United States. 25 In studies from Europe the seroprevalence in pregnant women has been noted to be up to 0.6%. These pregnant women were primarily of African or Caribbean descent. 94 HTLV-I antigen has been identified in breast milk of HTLV-I positive mothers. 147 Another report shows that basal mammary epithelial cells can be infected with HTLV-I and can transfer infection to peripheral blood monocytes. 162 Human milk from HTLV-I positive mothers caused infection in marmosets. 148, 283 HTLV-I infection clearly occurs via breastfeeding and a number of reports document an increased rate of transmission of HTLV-I to breastfed infants compared with formula fed infants. 7, 8, 10, 11, 119, 120, 258 Ando and associates in two separate reports demonstrated a parallel decline in antibodies against HTLV-I in both formula fed and breastfed infants to a nadir at about 1 year of age and a subsequent increase in antibodies from 1 to 2 years of age. The percentage of children seropositive at 1 year of age was 3.0% and 0.6%, at 1.5 years of age it was15.2% and 3.9%, and at 2 years of age it was 41.9% and 4.6% in the breastfed and formula fed groups, respectively. A smaller group of children followed out through 11 to 12 years of age demonstrated no newly infected children after 2 years of age and no loss of antibody in any child who was seropositive at 2 years of age. 10, 11 Transmission of HTLV-I infection via breastfeeding is also clearly associated with the duration of breastfeeding. 258, 259, 276, 277 It has been postulated that the persistence of passively acquired antibodies against HTLV-I offers some protection through 6 months of life (Table 17-5) .",

Yoshinaga and associates presented data on the HTLV-I antigen producing capacity of peripheral blood and breast milk cells and showed an increased mother-to-child transmission rate when the mother's blood and breast milk produced large numbers of antigenproducing cells in culture. 289 Hisada and associates reported on 150 mothers and infants in Jamaica, demonstrating that a higher maternal provirus level and a higher HTLV-I antibody titer were independently associated with HTLV-I transmission to the infant. 124 Ureta-Vidal and associates reported an increased seropositivity rate in children of mothers with a high proviral load and elevated maternal HTLV-I antibody titers. 265 Various interventions have been proposed to decrease HTLV-I transmission via breastfeeding. Complete avoidance of breastfeeding was shown to be an effective intervention by Hino and associates in large population of Japanese in Nagasaki. 122 There was an 80% decrease in transmission by avoiding breastfeeding. Breastfeeding for a shorter duration is another effective alternative. Ando and associates showed that freezing and thawing breast milk decreased the infectivity of HTLV-I. 9 Sawada and associates demonstrated in a rabbit model that HTLV-I immune globulin protected against HTLV-I transmission via milk. 227 It is reasonable to postulate that any measure that would decrease the maternal provirus load or increase the anti-HTLV-I antibodies available to the infant might decrease the risk of transmission. The overall prevalence of HTLV-I infection during childhood is unknown because the majority of individuals do not manifest illness until much later in life. The timing of HTLV-I infection in a breastfeeding population has been difficult to assess because of passively acquired antibodies from the mother and issues related to testing. Furnia and associates estimated the time of infection for a cohort of 16 breastfed infants in Jamaica. 95 The estimated median time of infection was 11.9 months as determined by PCR as compared with the estimated time of infection, based on whole virus Western blot, of 12.4 months.",

If the risk of lack of breast milk is not too great and formula is readily available and culturally acceptable, then the proscription of breastfeeding or at least a recommendation to limit the duration of breastfeeding to 6 months or less is appropriate to limit the risk of HTLV-I transmission to the infant.

The evidence of HIV transmission via breastfeeding is irrefutable. Two recent publications summarize the current evidence for HIV transmission via breastfeeding in the literature. 214, 264 Since 1985, case reports have documented HIV transmission via breast milk to children around the world. 123, 136, 160, 293 Primary HIV infection in breastfeeding mothers, with the concomitant high viral load, is associated with a particularly high rate of HIV transmission via breast milk. Palasanthiran and associates estimated that risk at 27%. 203 Large observational studies have demonstrated higher rates of HIV transmission in breastfed infants of mothers with chronic HIV infection compared with formula fed infants. 30, 69, 85 A systematic analysis of published reports estimated the additional risk of perinatal HIV transmission due to breastfeeding to be 14% (95% CI: 7% to 22%). 78 More recently published cohort studies similarly attributed additional risk of HIV transmission due to breastfeeding at 4% to 22% over and above the risk from prenatal and intrapartum transmission. 26, 67, 82 Laboratory reports demonstrate the presence of cell-free virus and cell-associated virus in breast milk as well as various immunologic factors that could block or limit infection. 37, 109, 188, 190, 200, 233, 261, 266 A dose response has been observed, correlating the HIV viral load in human milk as well as the mother's plasma viral load with an increased transmission risk for the breastfed infant. 210, 217, 221, 236 Many of the potential risk factors associated with human milk transmission of HIV have been described. The cumulative risk of HIV transmission is higher the longer the duration of breastfeeding. 69, 161, 182, 186, 267 Maternal characteristics related to transmission of HIV via human milk include younger maternal age, higher parity, lower CD4 + counts, higher plasma viral loads, and breast abnormalities (mastitis, abscess, or nipple lesions). Characteristics of human milk that relate to a higher risk of transmission include higher viral load in the milk, lower concentrations of antiviral substances (lactoferrin, lysozyme), and lower concentrations of virus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, secretory IgA, and IgM. Mixed breastfeeding is also associated with a higher risk of HIV transmission compared with exclusive breastfeeding. 64, 65, 260 The measurable benefits of breast milk versus the relative risk of HIV transmission to the infant due to exclusive breastfeeding (with optimization of other factors to decrease HIV transmission) has not yet been studied in a prospective fashion. 159 There are a number of potential interventions to prevent breastfeeding transmission of HIV-1 that can be utilized (Box 17-2) . The simplest and most effective is the compete avoidance of human milk. This is a practical solution in places like the United States and other countries where replacement feeding as well as other strictly medical interventions are feasible and reasonable, and the risk of not providing breast milk to the infant is negligible. In resource-poor situations, where the risk of other infections is high without the benefits of breast milk, then breastfeeding is appropriate along with any reasonable interventions to decrease HIV transmission via breast milk.",

There is limited information of the practicality and effectiveness of many of these interventions in clinical trials. Some of these may not be feasible in certain settings such as pasteurization or maternal antiretroviral therapy. Others may not be culturally acceptable such as treating expressed breast milk prior to giving it to the infant or even exclusive breastfeeding. Any method of treating the breast milk, to decrease viral load, will need to be clinically assessed as to its effect on the nutritional and protective benefits for the infant, including nutritional status, growth, development, and overall survival.

However, women who are HIV seronegative but at particularly high risk of seroconversion (e.g., injection drug users and sexual partners of known HIV-positive persons or active drug users) should be educated about HIV with an individualized recommendation concerning the appropriateness of breastfeeding. In addition, during the perinatal period, information should be provided on the potential risk of transmitting HIV through breast milk and about methods to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection. \u2022 Each woman whose HIV status is unknown should be informed of the potential for HIVinfected women to transmit HIV during the peripartum period and through breast milk and the potential benefits to her and her infant of knowing her HIV status and how HIV is acquired and transmitted.

            "text": "The potential effect of breastfeeding on the HIVpositive mother needs to be assessed in relation to the mother's health status. Two studies have examined this and reported conflicting results. The first study from Kenya demonstrated a significantly higher mortality rate in breastfeeding mothers compared with a formula feeding group in the 2 years after delivery. The hypothesized explanation offered by the authors for this difference was increased metabolic demands, greater weight loss, and nutritional depletion. 189 A second study from South Africa showed an overall lower mortality rate in the two groups with no significant difference in mortality rate over 10 months of observation. 66 In summary, breastfeeding of infants by HIVpositive mothers does lead to an increased risk of HIV infection in the infant. There is much still to be understood about the mechanisms of HIV transmission via breast milk and the action and efficacy of interventions to prevent such transmission. The complete avoidance of breastfeeding remains a crucial component for the prevention of perinatal HIV infection in the United States and many other countries. In resource-poor settings, where breastfeeding is the norm and where it provides vital nutritional and infection protective benefits, the WHO, UNICEF, and UNAIDS recommend education, counseling, and support for HIV-infected mothers so they can make an informed choice concerning infant feeding. Mothers choosing to breastfeed should receive additional education, support, and medical care to minimize the risk of HIV transmission and to optimize their own health status during and after breastfeeding. Mothers choosing to use replacement feedings should receive parallel education, support, and medical care for themselves and their infants to minimize the effect of the lack of breastfeeding. The decision about infant feeding for the HIV-positive mother remains a true dilemma-a choice between two equally unsatisfactory alternatives. It is only through continued research and education concerning the potential interventions to prevent HIV transmission via breast milk that we can minimize transmission and optimize infant nutrition and health.",

Because of aggressive immunization programs, rabies in domesticated dogs and cats in the United States is uncommon. The virus is found in the saliva and nervous tissue of infected animals. Transmission occurs by bites, licking, or simply contact of oral secretions with mucous membranes or nonintact skin. Many cases of rabies in humans now lack a history of some obvious contact with a rabid animal. This may be a result of the long incubation period (generally 4 to 6 weeks, but can be up to 1 year, with reports of incubation periods of several years), a lack of symptoms early in an infectious animal, or airborne transmission from bats in enclosed environments (caves, laboratories, houses). Person-to-person transmission via bites has not been documented, although it has occurred in corneal transplants. 31 No evidence indicates transmission through breast milk.",

The progression and severity of maternal illness can preclude breastfeeding, but separation of the infant from the mother is appropriate regardless of the mother's status and method of infant feeding. Breastfeeding should not continue when the mother has symptoms of rabies, and the infant should receive postexposure immunization and close observation. Depending on the scenario, the nature of the mother's illness, the possible exposure of the infant to the same source as the mother, and the exposure of the child to the mother, postexposure immunization of the infant may be appropriate. A more common scenario is the mother's apparent exposure to rabies (without exposure for the infant), necessitating postexposure immunization of the mother with rabies vaccine. In the majority of cases, in the absence of maternal illness, breastfeeding can reasonably continue during the mother's five-dose immunization series over 28 days. In a rare situation in which apparent exposure of the mother and infant to rabies occurs together, postexposure treatment of both mother and infant should be instituted, and breastfeeding can continue.",

Children over 1 year of age can be safely and reasonably vaccinated with smallpox in the face of a probable smallpox exposure. Smallpox vaccination of infants younger than 1 year of age is contraindicated. Breastfeeding is listed as a contraindication to vaccination in the pre-event vaccination program. It is unknown whether vaccine virus or antibodies are present in breast milk. The risk of infection due to contact or aerosolization of virus from a mother's smallpox vaccination site is the same for the breastfed and formula fed infant. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also does not recommend pre-event smallpox vaccination of children younger than 18 years old. 275 A report documents tertiary contact vaccinia in a breastfeeding infant. 96 A U.S. military person received a primary smallpox vaccination and developed a local reaction at the inoculation site. Despite reportedly observing appropriate precautions, the individual's wife developed vesicles on both areolae (secondary contact vaccinia). Subsequently, the breastfeeding infant developed lesions on her philtrum, cheek, and tongue. Both the mother and infant remained well and the infections resolved without therapy. Culture and PCR testing confirmed vaccinia in both the mother's and the infant's lesions. The breast milk was not tested. 96 Sepkowitz reported on 27 cases of secondary vaccinia in households in a review from 1931 to 1981. 239 The CDC reported 30 suspected cases of secondary/tertiary vaccinia with 18 of those cases confirmed by culture or PCR. The 30 cases were related to 578,286 vaccinated military personnel. This is an incidence of 5.2 cases per 100,000 vaccinees and 7.4 cases per 100,000 primary vaccinees. 53 In a separate report on the civilian preevent smallpox vaccination program, 37,802 individuals were vaccinated between January and June 2003 and there were no reported cases of contact vaccinia. 51 The risk of contact vaccinia is low. The risk is from close or intimate contact. In the above-mentioned case, the risk for the infant was contact with the mother's breasts, the inadvertent site of her contact vaccinia. Breastfed and formula fed infants are equally at risk from close contact in the household of a smallpox vaccinee or a case of secondary vaccinia, and separation from the individual is appropriate in both situations. If the breast of the nursing mother is not involved, then expressed breast milk can be given to the infant. (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) . 208 It is estimated that 150 to 300 asymptomatic cases of West Nile infection occur for every 20 febrile illnesses and for every one case of meningoencephalitis associated with West Nile virus. West Nile fever is usually a mild illness of 3 to 6 days' duration. The symptoms are relatively nonspecific, including malaise, nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, and rash. West Nile disease is characterized by severe neurologic symptoms (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis, and occasionally optic neuritis, cranial nerve abnormalities, and seizures). Children are infrequently sick with West Nile virus infection and infants younger than 1 year of age have rarely been reported. 208 The case-fatality rate for 2003 in the United States was approximately 2.5%, but has been reported as high as 4% to 18% in hospitalized patients. The case-fatality rate for persons over 70 years of age is considered to be higher, 15% to 29% among hospitalized patients in outbreaks in Romania and Israel. 208 The primary mechanism of transmission is via a mosquito bite. Mosquitoes from the genus Culex are primary vectors. The bird-mosquito-bird cycle serves to maintain and amplify the virus in the environment. Humans and horses are incidental hosts. The pathogenesis of the infection is believed to occur via replication of the virus in the skin and lymph nodes, leading to a primary viremia which seeds secondary sites before a second viremia causes the infection of the central nervous system and other affected organs. 39, 72 Transmission has been reported in rare instances during pregnancy 5, 48 via organ transplant 137 and percutaneously in laboratory workers. 50 West Nile virus transmission occurs via blood and blood product transfusion, 127 and the incidence has been estimated to be as high as 21 per 10,000 donations during epidemics in specific cities. 28 There is no evidence of direct personto-person transmission without the mosquito vector.",

Eight days later the mother had a severe headache and was hospitalized with fever and a CSF pleocytosis on day 12 after delivery. The mother's CSF was positive for WNV-specific IgM antibody. The infant had been breastfed from birth through the second day of hospitalization of the mother. Samples of breast milk were WNV-specific IgG and IgM positive on day 16 after delivery and WNV-specific IgM positive on day 24. The same milk was WNV-RNA positive by PCR testing on day 16, but not on day 24 after delivery. The infant tested positive for WNV-specific IgM in serum at day 25 of age, but remained well without fever. There was reportedly no clear-cut exposure to mosquitoes for the infant. The cord blood and placenta were not available to be tested. IgM antibodies can be found in low concentrations in breast milk, but this is not common or as efficient as the transfer of IgA, sIgA, or IgG into breast milk. This is the only case currently reported in the literature. Live virus has not been cultured from the samples of breast milk.",

In that same study, of 56 women with untreated EM who had detectable B. burgdorferi DNA in the urine, 32 still had detectable DNA in the urine 15 to 30 days after starting treatment, but none had it 6 months after initiating therapy. Ziska and associates reported on the management of nine cases of Lyme disease in women associated with pregnancy; seven of the nine women were symptomatic at conception and six received antibiotics throughtout pregnancy. Follow-up of the infants, showed no transmission of Lyme disease, even in the seven infants who had been breastfed. 294 The lack of adequate information on transmission of B. burgdorferi via breast milk cannot be taken as proof that it is not occurring. If one extrapolates from data on syphilis and the Treponema pallidum spirochete, it would be prudent to discuss the lack of information on the transmission of B. burgdorferi via breast milk with the mother or parents and to consider withholding breast milk at least until therapy for Lyme disease has begun or been completed. If the infection occurred during pregnancy and treatment has already been completed, the infant can breastfeed. If infection occurs post partum or the diagnosis is made post partum, infant exposure may have already occurred.

Although most infants with congenital infection are asymptomatic at birth, visual abnormalities, learning disabilities, and mental retardation can occur months or years later. There is a clearly defined syndrome of congenital toxoplasmosis, with the most severe manifestations involving the CNS, including hydrocephalus, cerebral calcifications, microcephaly, chorioretinitis, sei-zures, or simply isolated ocular involvement. The risk of fetal infection is related to the timing of primary maternal infection, although transmission can occur with preexisting maternal toxoplasmosis. In the last months of pregnancy the protozoan is more readily transmitted to the fetus, but the infection is more likely to be subclinical. Early in pregnancy the transmission to the fetus occurs less frequently but does result in severe disease. Treatment of documented congenital infection is currently recommended, although the duration and optimal regimen have not been determined, and reversal of preexisting sequelae generally does not occur. 215 Prevention of infection in susceptible pregnant women is possible by avoiding exposure to cat feces or the organism in the soil. Pregnant or lactating women should not change cat litter boxes, but if they must, it should be done daily and while wearing gloves. The oocyst is not infective for the first 24 to 48 hours after passage. Mothers can avoid ingestion of the organism by fully cooking meats and carefully washing fruits, vegetables, and food preparation surfaces. 62 In various animal models, T. gondii has been transmitted through the milk to the suckling young. The organism has been isolated from colostrum as well. The newborn animals became asymptomatically infected when nursed by an infected mother whose colostrum contained T. gondii. Only one report has identified T. gondii in human milk, and some question surrounds the reliability of that report. 156 Transmission during breastfeeding in humans has not been demonstrated. Breast milk may contain appropriate antibodies against T. gondii. Given the benign nature of postnatal infection, the absence of documented transmission in human breast milk, and the poten-tial antibodies in breast milk, no reason exists to proscribe breastfeeding by a mother known to be infected with toxoplasmosis.",
