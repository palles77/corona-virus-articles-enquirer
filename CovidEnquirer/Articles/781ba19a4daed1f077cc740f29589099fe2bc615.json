FLJ includes L. japonica whereas FJ includes Lonicera macranthoides, Lonicera hypoglauca, Lonicera confusa and Lonicera fulvotomentosa. FLJ could be distinguished from FL using four quantitative and 10 qualitative characters, ITS sequences, chlorogenic acid and luteoloside contents. Analyses revealed that L. japonica was very different from the other species. The results have implications for the identification and quality control of species of Lonicera used medicinally, suggesting that species should not be interchanged in medicinal preparations.",

(Caprifoliaceae), have been used as a common traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of exopathogenic wind-heat, epidemic febrile diseases, sores, carbuncles, furuncles, and some infectious diseases (Committee for the Pharmacopoeia of PR China, 2010; Shang et al., 2011) . Recently, FLJ has been used extensively to prevent and treat some serious human and veterinary viral diseases including SARS coronavirus and H1N1 (Swine) flu virus. Therefore, FLJ has been called the 'Plant antibiotic' (Jiao, 2009 ). It has also been used as a food and as a healthy beverage, e.g. the famous Chinese herbal tea of 'Wang Lao Ji', all over the world (Wang, 2010) . The flower buds from several species of Lonicera, such as L. macranthoides Hand. Mazz., L. fulvotomentosa Hsu., L. hypoglauca Miq., L. confusa DC., and L. similis Hemsl., are also considered as alternatives to FLJ in folk medicines and are described as 'Jin Yin Hua' (alternative name of FLJ) in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Xu et al., 1988 ; Committee for the Pharmacopoeia of PR China, 2000) . Before 2005, L. japonica and some related species were described as the original plants of FLJ, and they were not distinguished in practical applications. Since 2005, Flos Lonicerae (FL), the flower buds of L. macranthoides Hand. Mazz., L. hypoglauca Miq., and L. confusa DC. have been listed in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (PPRC) (Committee for the Pharmacopoeia of PR China, 2005) . In the 2010 PPRC, L. fulvotomentosa was also recorded as one of the original plants of FL. However, to date the original plants of FL and other Lonicera species have continued to be misused as FLJ in medicines, foods, and healthcare products in China.",

            "text": "The commercial value of FLJ in herbal medicine trading markets has increased over 400% in recent years, and over 30% of current traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions contain FLJ (Yuan et al., 2012) . This increasing demand has resulted in large areas of L. japonica and related Lonicera species being cultivated with various cultivars and landraces (Hu et al., 2011) , and many wild Lonicera species are also harvested as medicines or foods. However, FLJ and FL from different species, cultivars, landraces, and wild germplasm have entered the market, causing a confusing array of medicinal materials with very different qualities. This is detrimental to the development of the Lonicera-related industry. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish a simple and effective approach to differentiating the complex original plants of FLJ and FJ. Previous studies on the identification of L. japonica and related species have mainly focused on their morphology and histology (Xu, 1979; Xu et al., 1979; Pu et al., 2002) , chemical components (Hu et al., 2011; Shang et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2012) , and various genetic molecular markers, such as RFLP , diagnostic PCR (Peng et al., 2009) , and the psbA-trnH intergenic spacer (Sun et al., 2011) . Xu (1979) described (with 15 illustrations) the botanical origin of 14 species and one subspecies of Lonicera. Glandular and non-glandular hairs were discovered as the distinguishing pharmacognostic characteristics of 20 Lonicera species (Xu et al., , 1981 . Floral morphology of L. japonica varied from that of L. hypoglauca, but not within L. japonica (Pu et al., 2002) . HPLC analysis showed that 'Nanjiang', a variation of L. similis, had the highest content of chlorogenic acid of six different Lonicera species (Hu et al., 2011) . However, the chemical components and contents of FLJ are often influenced by different habitat, harvesting time, medicinal parts, extraction methods, and whether the flowers are fresh or dry (Shang et al., 2011) . Molecular markers mainly including intergenic spacers of ITS and psbA-trnH were found to identify L. japonica and related species Peng et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011) .",

Three Lonicera species, L. hypoglauca Miq., L. confusa DC. and L. dasystyla Rhed., were also included in the PPRC with L. japonica as the origin plant of FLJ since 1977. In 2005, the PPRC changed the rule once more, and although L. japonica was retained as the origin plant of FLJ, new medicinal material of FL from the flower buds of L. macranthoides, L. hypoglauca and L. confusa were recorded. Lonicera fulvotomentosa was included as one of the origin plants of FL in the latest PPRC (Committee for the Pharmacopoeia of PR China, 2010). The repeated changes in the rules of FLJ caused confusion about the origin plants of FLJ and FJ. The morphological characteristics of several Lonicera species were described in the Flora of China (Xu et al., 1988) . However, it is usually difficult to identify closely related species of Lonicera based on traditional classification owing to their similar morphological characteristics (Sun et al., 2011) . Generally, the morphological characteristics were only qualitatively described with illustrations (Xu, 1979; Xu et al., 1979) . In this study, multi-character joint analysis showed that L. japonica could be distinguished from L. macranthoides, L. hypoglauca and L. fulvotomentosa based on four quantitative and 10 qualitative characters. L. japonica has been domesticated from wild species and cultivated for hundreds of years mainly in the Shandong and Henan provinces of China. Many L. japonica germplasm with obvious different morphological characteristics, yield and quality were formed after long-term natural and artificial selection (Zhang, 2005) . In this study, three kinds of L. japonica germplasm, yellow flowers cultivars, wild germplasm, and red flowers cultivars were also identified with morphological characteristics (see Table 2 ).",

            "text": "Phytochemical and pharmacological research showed that more than 140 chemical compounds have been isolated from L. japonica (Shang et al., 2011) . Among these compounds, chlorogenic acid and luteoloside have been chosen as biomarkers to characterize the quality of FLJ by the PPRC (Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2010). However, the active components of FLJ varied in contents along with different L. japonica germplasm. Chlorogenic acid and luteoloside contents were very different among the L. japonica germplasm samples of the current study, and only 10 were up to a grade of !1.5% chlorogenic acid and !0.05% luteoloside as decided by the 2010 PPRC. The FLJ from wild L. japonica germplasm had a high chlorogenic acid content and relatively low luteoloside content. Yuan et al. (2012) reported that the chlorogenic acid, luteoloside, quercitin, and isopropyl laurate contents are higher overall in red FLJ flower buds compared with those of FLJ. We detected that the chlorogenic acid and luteoloside contents were different in red FLJ from the four cultivars with red flowers, and two red flower Table 3 Chlorogenic acid and luteoloside contents of FLJ (L. japonica) and FL (L. macranthoides). cultivars had the lowest chlorogenic acid contents. The active components of FLJ have been shown to vary with habitat (Xing et al., 2003) , harvesting time (Xu et al., 2010) , processing (Huang et al., 2009) , and so on. Whether the labile and inconsistent chemical components are appropriate biomarkers for identifying and quality control of FLJ should be studied further. The active components, which are secondary metabolites produced in the secondary metabolism process, differ between species of Lonicera (Xu et al., 1988; Hu et al., 2011) . The chlorogenic acid contents of L. japonica, L. confusa, L. hypoglauca, L. macranthoides, L. acuminate and L. similis were 5.06%, 3.25%, 2.11%, 5.72%, 3.06% and 7.66%, respectively (Hu et al., 2011) . Chlorogenic acid content (2.80%-5.08%) of L. macranthoides is higher than that of FLJ, and luteoloside is relatively low (0.04%-0.06%) in L. macranthoides . Recently, chlorogenic acid and luteolin were found in other medicinal plants, where the contents were higher than L. japonica (Committee for the Pharmacopoeia of PR China, 2010; Shang et al., 2011) . In this study, two cultivars of L. macranthoides are up to the grade of chlorogenic acid and luteoloside contents for FLJ as decided by the PPRC. The results also confirm the conclusion that employing chlorogenic acid and luteolin to control the quality of FLJ lacks specificity (Shang et al., 2011) . The specific effective component Macranthoidin B of FJ may be more suitable for identifying and evaluating the FLJ and related preparations blended with FJ (Lin et al., 2013) .",
