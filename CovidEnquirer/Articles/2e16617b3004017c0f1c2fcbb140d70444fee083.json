The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics and outcomes of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza and other respiratory viruses. Methods: Clinical data of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with respiratory viruses January 2014-June 2018 were reviewed. Respiratory viral infection was identified by multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Among 126 patients who underwent multiplex RT-PCR, respiratory viral infection was identified in 46% (58/126): 28 patients with influenza and 30 patients with other respiratory viruses. There was no significant difference in baseline and clinical characteristics between patients with influenza and those with other respiratory viruses. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was more frequent in patients with influenza than in those with other respiratory viruses (32.1% vs 3.3%, p=0.006). Co-bacterial pathogens were more frequently isolated from respiratory samples of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza virus than those with other respiratory viruses. (53.6% vs 26.7%, p=0.036). There were no significant differences regarding clinical outcomes. In multivariate analysis, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II was associated with 30-mortality (odds ratio, 1.158; 95% confidence interval, 1.022-1.312; p=0.022). Conclusion: Respiratory viral infection was not uncommon in patients with pulmonary ARDS. Influenza virus was most commonly identified and was associated with more co-bacterial infection and ECMO therapy.",

Respiratory specimens such as bronchial and endotracheal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swab or sputum were obtained for RT-PCR analysis.

Baseline (age, sex, body mass index, and comorbidities) and clinical characteristics (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, clinical complications [shock, acute kidney injury], management, etc.) were assessed. Additionally, data from laboratory (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet, C-reactive protein [CRP] level, total protein level, albumin level, etc.), microbiologic data (types of respiratory virus, co-respiratory bacterial or fungal pathogens) and clinical outcomes (length of stay in ICU and hospital, mortality) were analyzed.

APACHE II was associated with ICU mortality in patients with pulmonary ARDS. ARDS is a common reason of admission to the ICU in critically ill patients with one-quarter of the total number of patients receiving mechanical ventilation being diagnosed with the condition 1 . ARDS also contributes to substantial mortality in the ICU 1 . Various risk factors are associated with ARDS and pulmonary ARDS is frequently encountered in ICU. Pneumonia has been known as the most common etiology of pulmonary ARDS 13 . The co-infection of respiratory virus was found in patients with severe pneumonia admitted to ICU ranging from 13.4% to 49% [3] [4] [5] . The frequency of respiratory viral infection in pulmonary ARDS has not been established. The current study showed similar frequency of respiratory viral infection in pulmonary ARDS as those of severe pneumonia in patients admitted to the ICU. Respiratory viruses play a role in development and progression of ARDS 8 ; therefore, it is important to elucidate the clinical significance of them in patients with pulmonary ARDS. Several studies have reported clinical outcomes in patients infected with respiratory viruses receiving mechanical ventilation [14] [15] [16] [17] . In the present study, clinical outcomes did not differ between patients with infected with influenza virus and those with other respiratory viruses. Similar clinical outcomes were reported in patients with respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus compared to influenza virus 17, 18 . In the current study, comparison of clinical outcomes in each respiratory viruses was not performed due to a few cases except for influenza virus.
