The overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 L of 2xYT medium containing 100 \u00b5g/mL of ampicillin and the culture was left to grow at 37 o C until OD 600 nm reached 0.7-1.0. Then, 1 mM of isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to induce the protein expression and the cells were placed in the incubator for another 5 hour at 30 \u00b0C with 200 rpm shaking. Cells were pelleted by spinning at 5000g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. Cell pellets were lysed by ultrasonication under denaturing conditions (100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM Tris-HCl, 8 M urea, 10 mM imidazole, pH = 8.0). The protein was purified as described in the Qiagen Expressionist TM using 50% Ni-NTA slurry. The supernatant lysate was mixed with a 50% Ni-NTA slurry S-3 and agitated by the rotator at 4 o C for 1 hr. The mixture was then loaded into an empty column, washed with wash buffer (100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM Tris-HCl, 8 M urea, 20 mM imidazole, pH = 8.0) for several column volumes and then eluted by elution buffer (100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM 8 M urea, 20 mM imidazole, pH = 4.5).

For limited proteolysis experiments, digestion was performed with TEV protease at 4 o C for partial digestion and at 37 o C for full digestion, using PBS (pH = 7.4) as the working buffer.

Trypsin Digestion. Trypsin powder (Amresco, USP grade) was dissolved in Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to prepare a stock solution (10 mg/mL, 0.4 mM). Substrates in Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) were mixed with trypsin at a final protease: protein ratio of 1:20 (w/w). Trypsin digestion experiments were performed by incubation at 25 o C for extended time course. After designated times, aliquots were taken and digestion was quenched by adding 5x loading buffer followed by boiling at 100 o C for 10 min. All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and further quantified by gel densitometry on Typhoon FLA9500 (GE Healthcare, Inc. In pathway (a), premature cyclization before dimerization gives the cyclic monomer. In pathway (b), the dimerization of X motif entwines the two chains. Depending on the geometry and the linker length/flexibility, four products are then possible, namely (from left to right) the interlocked [2]catenane, the simple cyclic dimer, the knotted cyclic dimer, and the noncovalently associated rings.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed to determine the apparent molecular weight of each protein. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on a Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL column with \u00c4KTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare Inc.). PBS (pH = 7.4) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was conducted on a MALDI TOF/TOF 5800 (AB Sciex, USA) mass spectrometer with sinapinic acid as the matrix. Protein quantification could be performed on a nanodrop (IMPLEN P330) for samples purified by SEC. Gel densitometry analysis was performed on Typhoon FLA9500 (GE Healthcare, Inc.) for SDS-PAGE images. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESIMS) analyses were performed on a system equipped with an ACQUITY H-Class UPLC (Waters Corp.",
