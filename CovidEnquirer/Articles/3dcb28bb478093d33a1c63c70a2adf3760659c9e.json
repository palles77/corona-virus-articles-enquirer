            "text": "Chikungunya is a vector borne disease that spreads quickly in geographically affected areas. Its outbreak results in acute illness that may lead to chronic phase. Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors, fog computing, mobile technology, cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency, minimum response time, high mobility, enhanced service quality, location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper, IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server, social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency, high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.",

            "text": "Chikungunya is the most rapidly spreading infectious virus which is resulting in a new threat to the public health globally. It is transmitted into the human body from two types of infected mosquitoes i.e. Aedes agypti and Aedes albopictis. This virus can spread in three ways: (1) Infectious female mosquitoes can transmit CHV to healthy humans. (2) Infectious humans can transmit it to healthy female mosquitoes. (3) Infectious female mosquitoes can lay infectious eggs. It was first identified in 1952 in Tanzania. According to World Health Organization, 6,93,489 suspected cases and 37,480 confirmed cases of chikungunya were reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) regional office. Out of these, 2,65,000 suspected cases were from Brazil, 1700 cases from Kenya and 19,000 were from Bolivia and Colombia respectively [1] . Henceforth, chikungunya remains a threat for the region. CHV has been identified in 60 countries of Africa, Asia, America and Europe. The symptoms of chikungunya are similar to dengue and zika virus which include most common symptoms like high fever, joint pain, headache, muscle pain, red eyes, nausea and rashes [2] . To differentiate CHV from dengue and zika virus, symptoms based comparison is represented in Table 1. In Table 1 '+ ++' indicates the major symptoms of dengue, zika and chikungunya virus, '++' represents the symptoms which are not so major but they are still significant indicators of these viruses, '+' represents symptoms which are very less frequent and they may or may not appear in person suffering from these viruses and '\u00c0' indicates the symptoms which are absent in the person suffering from corresponding disease.",

Such type of diseases cannot be controlled effectively by using existing healthcare systems. Comparative analysis of published work of CHV and remote monitoring based healthcare systems are represented in Table 2 . The published work has been compared on the basis of 11 important specifications i.e. major contributions, application domain, IoT, cloud computing (CC), fog computing (FC), prediction model (PM), real time perspective (RTP), outbreak role index (ORI), alert generation (AG), security mechanism (SM) and comparison with infectious diseases (CD). These systems have various limitations such as diagnostic tests are not readily available, lack of people involvement in providing vital information about their health and environment conditions, and traditional method to diagnose and monitor proactive diseases. Sometimes, it is not possible for the patient to visit the hospital for routine checkup or doctors cannot monitor each patient regularly by visiting them. Hence, a remote monitoring system is strongly needed to provide healthcare support services.",

Even, many healthcare applications using mobile technology and context-aware technology are Represented structure, vector, symptoms and signs of CHV No No No No No No No No No No Silva et al. [11] Described clinical and laboratory methods to make distinction among dengue, zika and CHV [3] . However, there exist many challenges in these systems such as latency issue, location awareness and transmission of big data. As big data is transmitted over a network, the chance of error is high because data transmission latency and packet dropping possibility are proportional to the volume of transmitted data. In case of emergency, single error in data transmission causes inaccurate diagnosis as well as delay in alerting the user which affects the human life. Therefore, there is a need to reduce the data transmission between mobile end users and cloud servers. Healthcare applications also require immediate analysis of data and real time decision without any delay which is not possible in cloud computing. So, a fog layer is included in between the cloud server and mobile end users. First layer consists of IoT based sensors to generate data for further processing on second layer. Second layer is fog layer to pre-process the data which is generated by IoT devices in first layer for real time decisions. Third layer is the cloud layer for storing and processing the data which cannot be processed by fog layer. Use of fog computing in IoT based healthcare system facilitates various benefits such as effective utilization of resources, quality of service assurance, availability of medical data on time and immediate emergency notification [4] . These major benefits encourage the use of fog as a middle layer between IoT sensors and cloud computing layer to identify CHV infected users and also to generate real time notifications to end users in time.",

Tools and techniques of SNA are useful if a social network graph has been created efficiently. So, Algorithm 4 provides step by step computation for creating global SNA graph. In this graph, once user is screened as possibly infected by classification component, his/her travelling locations are traced through GPS enabled mobile phones. These locations are added in the global SNA graph and make edges between these locations and user. It is created and updated on time. Different color schemes are also used for different regions as well as different users while creating SNA graph as shown in Fig. 2(a) . In SNA graph, red color for infected regions and possibly infected users, green color for uninfected regions and uninfected users, and yellow color for risk prone regions.

FCM classifier was implemented on an Intel i7 CPU at 2.50 GHz with 4 Gbytes memory using Matlab running on windows 7 using the dataset of 5000 cases. The dataset is first normalized to transform symptoms values accepted in 'yes' or 'no' into the interval [0,1] according to the strength of each symptom to avoid numerical difficulties during calculation. The classification accuracy of FCM algorithm is tested with fuzzy strength parameter 'm' which varies in the range [1, 2] . For each choice of 'm', we test the various statistical parameters namely, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, recall and error rate. Finally, the one with lowest error rates and the highest accuracy are selected as the optimal fuzzy strength parameter. Table 9 summarized the results of classification performance of FCM in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall and error rate. From Table 9 , we can see that the results of the classification performance of FCM classifier with different value of 'm' parameter are very close. But highest accuracy is achieved with 'm' = 2. The results show that the system is able to efficiently classify the users into possibly infected or uninfected with high value classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision & recall and low values for error. Fig. 3 represents the comparison of different classification algorithm namely, NN (Neural Network), FKNN (Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbors) and NB (Naive Bayes) using different number of cases. The accuracy of classification algorithms is shown in Fig. 3 (a) which shows that the FCM based classification algorithm performs better than all other algorithms. Fig. 3 (b) shows the classification time of different algorithms using different datasets. Fig. 3 (c) represents the classification execution time of FCM classifier with different datasets which are transmitted to health fog rather than being sent to the cloud for processing and analysis. The graphical trend shows that proposed system through health fog computing layer identify category of user as possibly infected or uninfected with less time than directly through cloud computing.

The proposed system is examined for determining the validity of alert generated on user's health condition. The main aim for statistically analyzing the efficiency of alert generation component is to verify the false positive alerts. These alerts are based on total number of alerts and evaluate alert generation in terms of delay to deliver information to the user and doctor. Delay time is calculated between time to deliver alert about the occurrence of event to user and time at which event occurred. As a comparative model, cloud based alert generation to doctors as well as users are compared with fog based alert generation in terms of response time. Fig. 4 represents the results which are depicting the estimated delay time for both cloud and fog based computing. The results show that real time notification from fog system is far efficient as compared to the notification from cloud with low value of delay during the occurrence of any abnormal or emergency situation. Various other statistical parameters are also considered for this purpose, such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, coverage, mean absolute error, root average square error, root relative squared error and relative absolute error. All these results are shown in Table 10 . Statistical parameters indicate that proposed system is highly accurate and effective as the low value of false positive alerts.

            "text": "NetLogo [30] is used for creating SNA graph. To evaluate SNA graph based risk assessment of infected and risk prone regions, data related to infected users and their travelling locations during CHV infection are generated over the Pathankot city in India. Two files in the.csv format containing the details of 5000 users and their travelling locations are mapped in the particular block of Pathankot city in the form of hexagonal structure as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). Fig. 5(b) shows the routing of a user from location A to location B without implementing any routing algorithm. Here, user passes through the infected as well as risk prone regions which increases the risk of catching CHV infection. Alternatively, the user has diverted to the safer path represented by using appropriate routing algorithm as shown in Fig. 5(c) . The red line in Fig. 5(b) shows the normal route and purple line in Fig. 5 (c) shows the proposed or safer route for the user by Google services. Fig. 6 depicts power consumption rate of the proposed system with varying number of datasets. These datasets are transmitted to both proposed system (health fog system and cloud computing system) and other system using only cloud computing technique for comparing the power consumption rate. The comparison results are shown in Fig. 6 which represents the comparison of power consumption rate of both fog computing and cloud computing with respect to different datasets. The trend of graph shows that power consumption is more in case of cloud computing as compared to fog computing. It is because the fog computing provides computation and communication services in the close proximity of end users. It reduces the volume of data transmitted over network which leads to less traffic resulting in low latency rate and ultimately less power consumption. But in case of cloud computing, large amount of data is transmitted to cloud server for processing which leads to higher traffic congestion over network. This has an adverse effect on response time and power consumption rate.",

Due to the advancement in information and communication technology with IoT, fog computing and cloud computing, it is now possible to enhance the level of information acquisition, storage, efficiently diagnose, and provide a global information access to users, doctors and healthcare professionals. In this paper, fog based intelligent system is proposed to accurately diagnose user as possibly infected or uninfected from CHV by using FCM clustering and immediately send diagnostic alerts to user's mobile from fog system. The main feature of this paper is the use of sensitivity factor with respect to time of various events for determining the health severity. On the basis of health severity, emergency alerts are generated for delivering event information to user's mobile on time through fog network. Furthermore, SNA is used to represent the state of outbreak. ORI is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts in due time to uninfected users those are visiting or living in risk prone or infected regions. It will help uninfected residents to take immediate precautions to prevent the outbreak of these viruses and government healthcare agencies to control the problem effectively. The experimental results of proposed system are compared with cloud computing technology. The results reveal that proposed framework achieves bandwidth efficiency, minimum execution time, and minimum delay in generation of real time notifications. ",
