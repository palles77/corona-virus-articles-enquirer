            "text": "Infectious bursal disease (IBD) continues to pose potential threat to poultry industry all over the world. The disease can spell disaster not only through its infection but also by break of immunity in chickens vaccinated for other diseases. l-Arginine, a ubiquitous, semi-essential amino acid has emerged as an imunostimulant from variety of human and animal studies. In the present study, we demonstrate the stimulatory effects of l-arginine on intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte (iIELs) functions as well as on systemic immune response in chickens orally vaccinated with live intermediate plus (IP) strain of IBD vaccine. Challenge studies with virulent IBDV revealed complete (100%) protection in IP + l-arginine group compared with 80% protection recorded in IP strain vaccinated chickens. Functional activities of iIELs evaluated by cytotoxicity assay demonstrated significantly high percentage cytotoxicity in IP + l-arginine groups compared with IP group (P < 0.05). Proliferative response of iIELs against IBDV antigen and Con-A was also significantly higher in IP + l-arginine group. Similar results were obtained with peripheral blood mononuclear cell blastogenic response to IBDV and Con-A analyzed as an indicator of systemic cell-mediated immune response. Orally administered IP strain vaccine elicited good antibody titres in both the groups, IP and IP + l-arginine, however, the antibody titres were significantly higher in IP + l-arginine group compared with IP vaccinated group (P < 0.05). These results clearly demonstrate that l-arginine stimulates intestinal and systemic immune response against IBDV.",

            "text": "Infectious bursal disease (IBD) or Gumboro disease caused by IBD virus is one of the most important immunosuppressive diseases in commercial poultry affecting mainly young chickens [1] . Eradication of IBD is difficult because of its high stability in the environment and the principal method like for other viral diseases of chickens is effective vaccination against IBD. The vaccines currently in use are either killed or cell culture adapted live, attenuated vaccines. Depending on the level of attenuation and virulence, these live vaccines are further categorized as hot or intermediate plus, intermediate and mild. The most effective strategies to control IBD includes vaccination of layer birds with inactivated oil-emulsified vaccines to provide maternal antibodies in chickens or immunization of young chickens with live attenuated vaccines followed with booster immunizations. After the emergence of very virulent IBDV, mild vaccines are generally ineffective and presence of maternal antibodies interferes with the efficacy of live vaccines. Another most important issue associated with live vaccines is immunosuppression and may cause lesions similar to natural infection in vaccinated birds [2] . There is definite requirement of a suitable immunomodulator that can minimize the suppres-sive effects of live vaccines and amplify specific protective response. l-arginine, a semi-essential dibasic amino acid has emerged as a regulator of many immunological and physiological processes. l-arginine attracted initial experimental attention in various animal tumor models [3] as a dietary supplement. The most promising immunostimulatory effects were observed in immunocompromised hosts after trauma, surgical stress or immunosuppression with HIV virus [4, 5] . Supplemental l-arginine stimulates the functional activities of different cell types including natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, lymphokine activated killer cells, T and B cells [6, 7] . We recently demonstrated that l-arginine stimulates specific protective response against IBD in chickens [8] . Mucosal tissues constitute an enormous surface area and act as an interface between the external and internal milieu of the host. Among the mucosal surfaces, gut mucosa serves a primary portal of entry to most of the infectious agents and is provided with defense system, the gut associated mucosal tissue (GALT). During natural course of IBD infection, primary viral replication occurs in GALT followed by secondary invasion in bursa of fabricius [9] . Antigen specific activation of mucosal immune system is important for protection of chickens from variety of infections. Numbers of strategies are evolved to induce protective immunity by antigenic stimulation of mucosal surfaces [10] . One of these strategies is oral delivery of vaccines, which is one of the most convenient and cheaper immunization routes. While, majority of vaccination strategies with mucosal adjuvants and delivery systems have demonstrated promise for enhancing mucosal immune responses in mammalian species, there is no adequate information relating to their performance in chickens. Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (iIELs) are a unique cell population found along the basement membrane of small intestine. Although, iIELs are strategically positioned to be the first line of cell defense against invading enteric pathogens, the true functions of iIELs are not clearly elaborated. There are several reports available regarding functional activities of iIELs such as cytotoxic [11] [12] [13] , NK like [14, 15] , antibacterial and mucosal immunosurveillance [16, 17] . There are either no or very few reports available regarding the role of iIELs and mucosal immunity in IBD infection. In the present study, we demonstrate that l-arginine stimulates the cytotoxicity and proliferation of iIELs against IBDV. Oral administration of live intermediate plus strain (IP) strain of IBD vaccine along with l-arginine elicited strong intestinal as well as systemic immune response. ",

Third group was supplemented with only 2% l-arginine in feed as an immunomodulator control and fourth group was kept as a unimmunized/untreated but challenged control. Fifth group was observed as an unimmunized and unchallenged control for the challenge experiment. The number of birds in each group was 60.

            "text": "We assessed safety and efficacy of orally administered live IP strain of IBD vaccine in 3-week-old chickens. The main objective of the study was to evaluate l-arginine as an immunomodulator of intestinal and systemic immunity that can reduce the immunosuppressive effects of live hot vaccine and amplify specific protective immune response against IBD. 2% l-arginine supplementation in feed was safe and free from any side effects [8] . Complete protection was recorded in IP + l-arginine group, where as in IP vaccine group 80% protection was achieved. Unimmunized and l-arginine control showed high mortality after challenge indicating that the challenge experiment was successful. The systemic humoral immune response was assessed by commercially available standard IBD ELISA kit. The levels of neutralizing antibodies determine the protection against IBDV in chickens [24] . Strong antibody response was observed in both the vaccinated groups, however antibody titres were significantly higher in IP + l-arginine group. These Results confirm that orally administered vaccine elicited good systemic antibody response. The elevated antibody response and protection in IP vaccinated and l-arginine supplemented group is attributed to the number of immunoregulatory functions of l-arginine on the immune system. l-Arginine is required for the differentiation of pro B to pre B cells and is also involved in the release of these cells from bone marrow [7] . After challenge with virulent IBDV, sudden fall in antibody titres indicates the antigen antibody interactions in vivo. Preformed antibodies specific to IBDV might be involved in neutralizing virus and the resultant immune complexes removal by complement-mediated lysis. The rise in antibody titres at 10 DPC indicates the booster effect of challenge virus on immune system mediated by clonal proliferation and increased numbers of plasma cells leading to enhance antibody production [25] . Both humoral and cellular immune responses mediated by T cells play an important role in the control of IBD infection [26] . The functions of iIELs were assessed by cytotoxicity and proliferative response to specific stimulation with IBDV and nonspecific stimulation with Con-A mitogen. The iIELs are anatomically positioned to serve as a first line of cellular defense against variety of enteric pathogens. In chickens, iIELs constitute two major subsets as NK and T cell types, which are phenotypically and functionally distinct IEL subpopulations [14] but their role in IBD infection remained unexplored. We speculate that iIELs are activated during natural course of IBD infection and may be involved in restricting the spread of IBDV to other lymphoid tissues. Results of cytotoxicity revealed increased activity from 7 to 21 DPI in IP and IP + l-arginine groups. The cytotoxicity of iIELs was drastically reduced at 3 and 5 DPC in all the groups, however the reduction was less severe in IP + l-arginine group compared with IP (P < 0.05). The iIELs are capable of wide range of effector functions known to T and NK cells. Recent evidences suggest that both antigen specific and nonspecific cytotoxic cells are integral component of mucosal immunity [27] . The cytotoxicity of iIELs is seen against chicken tumor cell lines, rotavirus in chickens [19] , Salmonella typhimirium in mice [28] and corona virus infection in mice [29] . The enhanced iIELs cytotoxicity in IP + l-arginine group may be attributed to immunostimulatory activities of l-arginine on GALT. It has been shown that supplemental l-arginine increased specific lymphocyte subsets in GALT [30] . We used purified IBDV antigen and Con-A to measure specific and nonspecific proliferative response of iIELs and PBMCs. Although both iIELs and PBMCs responded to IBDV and Con-A stimulation, optical densities of PBMCs were always higher than iIELs indicating that the cellular activity was higher in PBMCs. There are mixed reports regarding proliferative ability of iIELs to mitogens, our results shows that iIELs respond well to mitogenic stimuli and are in agreement with other published studies [20, 31] . The iIELs and lymphocyte proliferation response was depressed in unimmunized and l-arginine controls after challenge with virulent IBDV indicates a possible damage to T cells by the challenge virus. Suppression of lymphocyte proliferation to Con-A compared to controls was observed at 7 DPI. Proliferation was severely depressed when iIELs and PBMCs were specifically stimulated with IBDV. Several authors reported that IBDV causes hyporesponsiveness of the PBMCs [32] [33] [34] . Administration of relatively pathogenic vaccine caused transitory depression of mitogenic response of peripheral lymphocytes [35] . The direct cytolysis of T lymphocytes by IBDV may be a possible factor responsible for mitogenic hyporensponsiveness [34] . The data of depressed blastogenic response were consistent with other reports [34, 35] , where detectable depression was noticed a week after infection. Subsequently hyporesponsiveness returned to normal or near normal levels. After challenge with virulent virus, the proliferative response to Con-A and IBDV was severely depressed indicating the immunosuppressive effects of challenge virus. Both iIELs and PBMCs obtained from chickens immunized with IP strain and supplemented with l-arginine showed significantly elevated proliferative response to IBDV and Con-A and the suppression was rapidly cleared compared to IP group and controls. l-arginine acts on different components of immune system. Supplementation of l-arginine enhanced proliferative response of T cells to mitogens [36] through the release of IL-2. l-Arginine also enhances the cytotoxicity of LAK and NK cells [6] . In summary, our results clearly demonstrate that complete protection was achieved against virulent IBDV challenge in chickens immunized orally with IP strain of IBDV and supplemented with l-arginine. l-Arginine is strong immunoregulator of the IP strain of IBDV vaccine and is safe, inexpensive, easy to administer in feed. l-Arginine not only enhanced the specific intestinal immune response as demonstrated by functional activities of iIELs against IBDV but also amplified the systemic immunity. l-Arginine, a newly emerged mucosal immunostimulant should prove valuable not only for IBD but also for several other diseases of poultry.",
