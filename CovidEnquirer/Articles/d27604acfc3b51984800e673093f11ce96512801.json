            "text": "Small incomplete RNAs which are derived from viral genomic RNA (gRNA) are associated with several plant viruses (Hillman et al., 1987; Burgyan et al., 1989; Li et a/., 1989) . These RNAs of-ten interfere with viral replication and are incapable of independent replication. For these reasons they are referred to as defective interfering RNAs (DI RNA& DI RNAs are distinguished from satellite RNAs by their high degree of homology to the gRNA of the virus with which they are associated. In contrast, satellite RNAs show little nucleotide sequence homology to the gRNA of the parent virus (Francki, 1985) . Although DI RNAs are commonly found in association with animal viruses, they appear to be much less prevalent in viral infections of plants. The first definitive DI RNA identified in plants was found associated with the cherry strain of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV; Hillman et a/., 1987) . DI RNAs are also associated with cymbidium ringspot virus (CyRSV), another tombusvirus (Burgyan et al., 1989; Rubino et a/., 1990) . Sequence analysis of these DI RNAs has re- vealed several stretches of sequence derived from different regions of the gRNA of the parent virus. DI RNA G associated with an isolate of the carmovirus turnip crinkle virus (TCV-B) is comprised primarily of two regions corresponding to the 5'-and 3'-terminal regions of the gRNA of the parent virus, and contains additional nonviral sequences at its 5' end (Li et al., 1989) . The TCV-B DI RNA intensifies symptoms when present in infections, whereas DI RNAs of the tombus group attenuate them. Coinfection of protoplasts with TBSV and DI RNAs results in reduced synthesis of gRNA relative to infections lacking the DI RNAs (Jones et al., 1990) . This reduction of gRNA production may be responsible, at least in part, for symptom attenuation observed in whole plants (Jones et a/., 1990) .",

Clover yellow mosaic virus (CYMV) possesses a 7015 nucleotide gRNA which is, to date, the largest RNA sequenced from this group (Sit et al., 1990) . A 191-kDa protein which contains putative consensus sequences for NTPase-helicases as well as for RNA polymerases (Skryabin et al., 1988; Argos, 1988) is encoded by the most 5' open reading frame (ORF) in the viral RNA. During infections, CYMV produces at least two coterminal subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) with approximate lengths of 2.1 and 1 .O kb (Bendena et al., 1987) encoding, respectively, a 25-kDa protein of unknown function and coat protein (White and Mackie, 1990) . A 1.2-kb RNA containing CYMV sequences was previously identified in polyribosomes extracted from infected plants, but was not extensively characterized (Bendena et a/., 1987) . We report here that some of the properties of this RNA species are consistent with those of DI RNAs.",

Subsequently, an aliquot of the unpurified transcription reaction was added directly to a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega Biotec., Inc.) containing [35S]methionine. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of twice-concentrated SDS sample buffer followed by boiling. In vitro translation was also carried out on 0.25 pg of CYMV RNA extracted from virions and on 0.25 pg of brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA. The products of translation were separated on an 1 1% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS (Laemmli and Favre, 1975) . lmmunoprecipitation of translation products with antisera directed against CYMV particles was carried out as previously described (Bendena et al., 1985) . (White and Mackie, 1990) . Both of these sgRNAs are also encapsidated (White and Mackie, 1990). We have examined more closely the 1.2-kb RNA species which is present in viral infections produced by some stocks of CYMV. RNAs from polyribosomes isolated from infected or control tissue or RNA extracted from virions were denatured, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membranes. Blots were incubated with a probe specific for the 3' portion of the CYMV gRNA. All four CYMV RNAs, including the 1.2-kb RNAs, can be detected in polyribosomal preparations from infected tissue (Fig. 1, lane b) . Furthermore, the 1.2-kb RNAs can be detected in virions prepared from infected leaves indicating that they can be encapsidated (Fig. 1 , lane e). Virions isolated from CYMV infections produced from viral stocks lacking the 1.2-kb RNAs did not contain this RNA species (Fig. 1 , lane f). No additional RNA species beyond those listed above have been detected in total RNA preparations from infected leaves, regardless of the stock used for inoculation (data not shown).",

(1990) . There are five single-base alterations present in all 1.2-kb RNAs examined, two of which map in the 3' end of the coat protein coding region. These changes result in a conversion of the amino acid sequence of the C-terminus of the coat protein from PYHRPE (Sit et a/.,. 1990) to LITGPE. The other three single-base changes occur in the 3' noncoding' region. These five single-base alterations detected in all 1.2-kb RNAs were also present in the gRNA from our viral stock (data not shown). This indicates that the 3' ends of the 1.2-kb RNAs are in fact faithful copies of the gRNA from which they were derived and that the sequence of the gRNA of our strain of CYMV has diverged from that of Sit et al. (1990) . Our virus stock containing these differences is infectious and is efficiently replicated and encapsidated. Thus, these alterations in the 3' noncoding region and in the extreme C-terminus of coat protein confer no detectable phenotype. The prototype 1.2-kb RNA also contains two additional single-base substitutions at positions 193 (U-C) and 574 (C-+U) which would not alter the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide relative to that of ORF 1 of CYMV. These two single-base substitutions are present only in the prototype 1.2-kb RNA and are not found in the gRNA of our stock.",

The 35-kDa product is also immunoprecipitated by this serum but less efficiently (Fig. 6, lanes k, I, and n) . The lower affinity of the fusion protein for coat protein antibody may be due to the absence of N-terminal epitopes of coat protein on the 35-kDa protein since the fusion protein is predicted to contain only 9 1 of 2 12 amino acids of coat protein. Unlabeled coat protein is an effective competitor of precipitation of the 35-kDa product indicating that it is coat protein-specific antibodies which are reacting with this polypeptide (Fig. 6, lane 0) . Non-immune serum is unable to immunoprecipitate the 35-kDa protein (Fig. 6, lane p) . Bands corresponding to approximately 30 kDa are visible in Fig. 6 , lanes m and n.

The structure of these RNAs suggest that they represent DI-like RNAs and establish them as the first such RNAs to be found associated with a member of the potexvirus group. A number of features of the 1.2-kb RNAs of CYMV distinguish them from previously characterized plant virus DI RNAs. First, the presence of the 1.2-kb RNAs in CYMV infections of broad bean plants produces no apparent alteration of symptoms whereas the DI RNAs associated with several other plant viruses can enhance or attenuate symptoms (Hillman et al., 1987; Burgyan et a/., 1989; Li et a/., 1989) . Since the mechanism of symptom development is not understood, this is not necessarily problematic. Knorr et a/. (1991) found that the appearance of some classes of TBSV DI RNAs is not immediately accompanied by symptom attenuation, suggesting that different species of DI RNAs may differ in their ability to interfere with symptoms. The 1.2-kb RNAs of CYMV may, therefore, represent an example of the inability of a defective RNA to attenuate virus-induced plant pathogenesis.",

The poor reactivity of the fusion protein with coat protein antibody, however, deterred any attempt to identify this protein in extracts from infected tissue.

Since all four sequenced members of the 1.2-kb RNA family encode a 19 1 -kDa/ coat protein fusion protein, maintenance of this fusion ORF may be advantageous, if not essential, for these RNAs. One possibility is that translation of the 1.2-kb RNAs may stabilize them. The influence of translation on the stability of a plant mRNA has been described by Vancanneyt et al. (1990) who found that reducing the size of the ORF on the patatin mRNA led to a decrease in its steady-state level.

While we cannot rule out the possibility that the conditions under which our passages were performed were suboptimal for generation of this type of RNA, it seems more likely that the successful formation of defective CYMV RNAs may be a rare event. We believe that to a large extent the initial deletion generating a defective RNA may be random. Subsequent propagation of the CYMV defective RNA seems to require an exact in-frame fusion of two protein coding sequences within limited regions of the genome, maintenance of encapsidation signals, and conservation of terminal nucleotide sequences which we presume to be necessary for RNA replication.
