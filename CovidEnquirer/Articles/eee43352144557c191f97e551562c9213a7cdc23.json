The 3CL pro -EPDTC crystals were obtained using a reservoir of 10% PEG 6000, 14% DMSO, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 M MES at pH 6.5.

The 3CL pro -JMF1586 data were collected at the wavelength of 1.000 \u00c5 using Taiwan beam line BL12B2 in SPring8 (Japan).

Its active site comprises the His 41 -Cys 145 catalytic dyad located at the cleft between domains I and II, and the third domain contributes to the dimerization of protease [2, 3] (Fig. 1A) . Here, five complex structures were determined. Diffraction data of the 3CL pro -JMF1586 crystal were processed for anomalous signal and exploited to locate the zinc atom sites by calculating anomalous difference Fourier maps. Two major Zn 2+ peaks were located in the active site of each protein molecule in the asymmetric unit. In the 3CL pro -EPDTC, 3CL pro -JMF1600, 3CL pro -JMF1586 complex structures, four DMSO molecules in each dimer derived from the crystallization condition were found. Two were located on the enzyme surface surrounded by the side chains of R 298 , M 6 , and F 8 of each subunit. The second pair of DMSO molecules was bound in the S1 pocket, which consists of the side chains of H 163 and F 140 and the main-chains of M 165 , E 166 and H 172 . The oxygen atom of DMSO is hydrogen bonded to the imidazole side chain of H 163 with a mean distance of 2.55 \u00c5 (Fig. 1A,B) .",

Nonetheless, the local metal center geometry of EPDTC, unlike that of TDT, is that the zinc ion binds to H 41 and C 145 in a more typical zinc tetrahedral geometry with the S-Zn-S bond angle of 107.2\u00b0 (  Fig. 2F) . Moreover, the electron density map of the zinc atom and two sulfur atoms of EPDTC can be clearly seen in each subunit, yet the bulky substituent groups are absent (Fig. S1 ). The lack of electron density might suggest that the substituents are disordered. We have performed a computer modeling study to address the question whether the bulky substituents impede the binding of the complex. Fig. S2 shows that the entire EPDTC could be accommodated in the active site pocket, with sufficient room for the bulky side groups to rotate about. Therefore conformational disorder of side chains remains a likely possibility.",

In the 3CL pro -JMF1586 complex, the zinc-centered tetrahedral coordination is formed by H 41 , C 145 and two nitrogen atoms. On the other hand, H 41 , C 145 , one nitrogen atom and a water molecule are responsible for the Zn coordination in the 3CL pro -JMF1600 complex (Fig. 2C,D) . Scheme 1 shows that the zinc atom is chelated by two nitrogen and two oxygen atoms for JMF1586, and by one nitrogen and three oxygen atoms for JMF1600. The Zn-N bond is stronger than the Zn-O bond, consistent with the lower K i value for JMF1586. Both structures indicate that the metal-oxygen bond of JMF1586 and JMF1600 must break prior to being substituted by H 41 and C 145 in the formation of the zinc-centered complex. Like the case above, the electron densities of the zinc ions and nitrogen atoms of JMF1586 and JMF1600 were visible, but not those for the substituent groups (Fig. S1 ).",

The 3CL pro -PMA structure reveals that a phenyl-bound mercury occupying the S3 pocket is responsible for inhibiting the enzymatic activity. One SARS-CoV 3CL pro molecule contains 12 free cysteine-SH residues, in which only C 44 , but not the active site C 145 , provides a specific coordination environment for the phenyl-bound mercury. Inorganic Hg ion is known to cause toxic effects, since the affinity of Hg(II) ion to thiol group in proteins lead to non-specific inhibition of cellular enzymes [17] . Therefore, structural studies of the specific interaction between mercury-conjugated compounds and the thiol groups of cysteine-containing enzyme may be valuable for the future development of specific inhibitors. The zinc inhibitors are coordinated to the catalytic dyad with the zinc ion surrounded by a tetrahedral or distorted tetrahedral arrangement of ligands.

This type of inhibition is similar to the zinc-mediated serine protease inhibitor keto-BABIM-Zn 2+ for trypsin in that a zinc ion is coordinated to two chelating nitrogen atoms of bis(5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl) methane (BABIM) and two catalytic residues (Ser-His) of trypsin in a tetrahedral geometry [18] . However, this zinc-centered inhibition mode has never been described before for cysteine protease. The safety of zinc-containing compounds for human use is indicated by the fact that zinc acetate and zinc sulfate are added as a supplement to the drug for the treatment of Wilson's disease and Behcet's disease, respectively [19, 20] . The possibility of zinc complexes incorporated into cells through the cell membrane is also demonstrated by the studies on type 2 diabetic treatment [21] . Here, our results show that the zinccentered coordination pattern would serve as a starting platform for inhibitor optimization and the development of potential drug for SARS therapies. Since 3C and 3CL proteases with the Cys-His catalytic residues have been found in several human viruses such as the family of Coronaviridae, and Arteriviridae [22, 23] , these proteases can be targets for the zinc derivatized inhibitors.",
