            "text": "Respiratory viral infections such as influenza cause a large burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and are a common reason for patients to seek medical care. They are also an increasingly recognized cause of community-acquired pneumonia, particularly in patients who are older, have underlying comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or are immunocompromised (Gadsby et al., 2016; Ruuskanen et al., 2011) . Clinical presentations are non-specific, so accurate and timely diagnostics are critical to optimizing antiviral use, limiting unnecessary antibiotics and reducing secondary spread of infection. Older diagnostic modalities such as serology, viral cultures, enzyme immunoassay and immunofluorescence tests are fraught with problems like poor sensitivity and slow turn-around time (Caliendo, 2011) . Many institutions have relied on rapid antigen immunoassay tests, which are specific and can produce a result in a clinically useful timeframe, but lack sensitivity and are unable to detect other pathogens, limiting their utility in times of low influenza prevalence (Bruning et al., 2017) . The revolution in the development, commercialization and dissemination of molecular multiplex assays for the rapid and accurate detection of respiratory viruses over the last decade has been a major step forward and has led to a greater appreciation of their ubiquity and contribution to many disease states (Gaydos, 2013; Gelfer et al., 2015; Varkey and Varkey, 2008) . However, in the setting of a routine diagnostic microbiology laboratory, these assays can be labor intensive to implement and run, and are often expensive.",

An example of this is the diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection, where many labs are now using an initial highly sensitive screening test followed by a specific secondary confirmatory molecular assay to improve overall sensitivity and specificity in a cost-effective manner (Makristathis et al., 2017) . However, this approach has not been widely studied in the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections. In one study of patients with influenza, a combined testing approach such as this has been shown to decrease the time to result, cost, antibiotic use, ICU admission and an increase in timely administration of oseltamivir (Gonzalez-Del Vecchio et al., 2015) .",

Samples were excluded if they were not processed through the usual algorithm or if final results were equivocal. Data was collected on patient age, testing location, time of nasopharyngeal swab collection, tests performed, final results and the time result was released.

In the winter period (mid December 2014 to April 2015), after an increase in the influenza prevalence, samples were first tested by Sofia\u00ae immunoassay (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA) for influenza, and also RSV in children b5 years old or when requested (Sofia Influenza A+B FIA, Package Insert, 2015). Samples testing positive did not undergo further testing; negative samples were subsequently tested by FilmArray\u00ae. During the summer months (May-early December 2015), specimens were tested by Biofire FilmArray\u00ae (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, a bioM\u00e9rieux company, Marcy, l'Etoile, France) alone (FilmArray\u00ae Respiratory Panel Package Insert, 2014) . Clinicians only had to order a 'respiratory viral panel' with specific testing performed determined by the laboratory in a standardized fashion. The manufacturer's instructions were followed for all testing procedures; there were no protocol variations. No other respiratory viral testing was performed on these samples.

Kaplan-Meier curves comparing these two time periods are shown in Fig. 2(a) . While the two curves look similar overall, there were a significantly higher proportion of final test results available in less than 90 minutes in the winter compared to the summer, due to the use of the faster antigen test during that season (11.1% versus 3.4%, odds ratio 3.58, 95% confidence interval 2.46-5.36, P b 0.001). This corresponded to 144 cases of influenza and 21 cases of RSV in which a diagnosis was made in less than 90 minutes. A comparison of the time to result by test type in only the 1505 patients tested using the 2-stage algorithm is shown in Fig. 2(b) .

The goal of this was to combine the benefits of an inexpensive, rapid, specific test with the accuracy of a more sensitive one, reducing the overall false negative rate. We have retrospectively evaluated the performance of this protocol change and have described significant benefits in terms of overall performance, timeliness and cost. While a variety of 2-stage testing approaches, including those using viral culture and older batched multiplex molecular assays have been described, our study is the first to evaluate this approach in the modern era using a new on-demand molecular diagnostic test. In our cohort, if we had only performed Sofia\u00ae antigen testing on all samples, we would have missed 158 cases of influenza, 82 of RSV (although some of these may have been diagnosed with more usage of the RSV antigen), 5 influenza-RSV coinfections, 331 other viruses, and 4 cases of M. pneumoniae. Conversely, if we had used Filmarray\u00ae alone for all samples, 280 cases of influenza, 39 RSV cases and 2 influenza/RSV coinfections would have had their diagnoses delayed by at least several hours, at significant additional cost. Despite processing almost twice as many specimens, during the winter the median time to result was similar to the summer and a significantly higher number of final results were available before 2 hours.",

            "text": "The diagnostic algorithmic testing strategy we have described has many advantages. Firstly, it decreases the overall turnaround time in the busy winter months. While a 1-2 hour time saving may not seem like much, having a result available within this timeframe means that the test is much more likely to be used for real-time clinical decisionmaking in the context of a busy emergency department or outpatient setting. It facilitates the rapid diagnosis of influenza and RSV, which would hopefully translate into earlier administration of antiviral therapy, which has significant therapeutic benefit (Aoki et al., 2003) , and could decrease use of unnecessary antibiotics. In addition, it could mean earlier initiation of appropriate infection control precautions and reduced secondary transmission. This effect will be amplified when applied across many patients. Secondly, it not only maximizes diagnostic accuracy for influenza, but also detects many other respiratory viral pathogens that can be clinically indistinguishable from each other. This provides both patients and clinicians with the clarity of a definitive microbiologic diagnosis and reassurance that a favorable prognosis is likely without the need for antibiotics. Furthermore, due to differences between transmission characteristics between respiratory pathogens, CDC guidelines for isolation precautions differ for each diagnosis (Siegel et al., 2007) . Identifying the specific pathogen may increase the likelihood that the appropriate precautions are implemented, reducing nosocomial transmission. Finally, it facilitates increased testing volumes within existing laboratory technician time constraints, and does not require input from the ordering clinician, who may not be familiar with the nuances of the different respiratory viral tests available. Using the Sofia\u00ae as a laboratory-based test rather than a true point-of-care test does increase turn-around time somewhat (minimal in locations with on-site laboratories and rapid specimen transport systems), but obviates the need to train non-laboratory based staff and maintain instruments outside the diagnostic laboratory.",

False positive results with the Sofia\u00ae antigen test clearly occur, and this could lead to misdiagnosis, unnecessary administration of oseltamivir, and potentially missing an alternative diagnosis. Patients testing positive by Sofia could be coinfected with a second virus (which is unlikely to have a significant impact on management decisions or outcome) or a bacterial pathogen (which if missed, could lead to failure to prescribe antibiotics). Rates of bacterial pathogens in our study were low, and many patients did receive empiric antibiotics despite a diagnosis of a virus to cover for the possibility of secondary bacterial infection. To minimize the risks of these errors occurring, we recommend only performing 2-stage testing during the influenza season when prevalence is high (to minimize the false positive rate), and making individualized decisions regarding use of antibiotics incorporating all available clinical data. Backup molecular testing should be available on clinician request for difficult cases.",

            "text": "The strength of our study is that we evaluated this diagnostic strategy in a large cohort of patients over a busy influenza season, in a real-world context. However there are some limitations that should be considered when interpreting our findings. Measuring clinical outcomes and downstream effects were beyond the scope of this study. However, other published studies have demonstrated the clinical impact of various molecular diagnostic tests and have shown earlier antiviral use, decreased ED and hospital length of stay, reduced secondary transmission and decreased antibiotic use (Aoki et al., 2003; Chu et al., 2015; Gelfer et al., 2015; Mayer et al., 2017) . We would anticipate a similar impact in our patient population. At the same time however, the requirement for a private room or cohorting of patients found to have respiratory viruses requiring isolation, which previously would have gone undiagnosed, will undoubtedly result in costly throughput issues, a consideration which must not be underestimated. Because patients testing positive by Sofia\u00ae did not undergo further testing, we could not determine the true sensitivity and specificity of this test compared to FilmArray\u00ae. Previous studies have shown Sofia\u00ae specificity to be high, with a recent meta-analysis reporting a pooled specificity of 95.3% but sensitivity of only 75.3% for influenza A & B, and pooled specificity of 97.8% and sensitivity of 80% for RSV (Bruning et al., 2017; Gomez et al., 2015; Hazelton et al., 2015; Noh et al., 2015) . Similarly, we assumed that all patients testing negative by PCR were true negatives; it is possible that some of these patients could have had false negative tests, i.e. that sensitivity of the FilmArray\u00ae is not truly 100%. While our findings are likely to be generalizable to other hospital-based clinical microbiology laboratories, the performance will be affected by a number of site-specific variables including testing volume, number of instruments (which affects ability to perform testing in parallel and therefore queuing), staffing, and the choice of specific rapid/molecular tests, with many options now commercially available. Finally, a formal cost-effectiveness analysis incorporating secondary costs such as laboratory technician time, hospital and drug costs was beyond the scope of this study, but could be considered to more fully evaluate this testing strategy relative to others. Financing within the US healthcare system is particularly complex and given intra-hospital budget 'silos', actual billing reimbursement charges as opposed to costs, reagent/instrument rental deals and purchasing arrangements, many other factors need to be considered to fully understand the economic implications of this approach.",

Our findings demonstrate a simple way to maximize performance of this test using a combined testing approach with a rapid immunoassay. As the array of licensed rapid molecular diagnostic tests for respiratory viral infections increases, including those available for use at the point of care, hospitals will need to carefully consider the best testing approaches based on their local epidemiology and available resources.
