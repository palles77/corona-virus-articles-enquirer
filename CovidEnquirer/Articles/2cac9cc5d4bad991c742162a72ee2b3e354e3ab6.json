In south-west China, Guan Du district is one of these areas. Guan Du is a suburban region of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province. China is a multi-ethnic country and has 56 ethnicities. Yunnan province is a multi-ethnic area with 52 ethnic groups, and is one of the poorest provinces in China. This study population is representative of the poor population in China. A computerized death registration system was established in 1998, which is validated for completeness every 3 years in this region. In 2003, Guan Du had a population of 335,622 (178,099 males and 157,523 females), with 17 townships and 157,604 families. The total area was 1025 km 2 . The major sources of income in this region are grain, vegetables and flowers. The per-capita income among peasants was USD$675. 5 From 1998 to 2003, the proportion of the population who were illiterate or semi-literate declined from 15.3% to 6.7%, 5,6 and the per-capita income among peasants increased steadily at an average rate of 13% per year. 5, 6 The local government has invested increasing public health expenditure on disease prevention and control, particularly for prevention and curative programmes for specific diseases (tuberculosis, endemic diseases, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, etc.). Since 1984, an immunization system has been in place in Kunming to immunize and monitor diseases routinely. Kunming has engaged in health promotion through some educa-tional programmes and by establishing smokingfree public areas.",

It has been estimated that COPD accounts for 35% of all smoking-related deaths. 13 Passive exposure to cigarette smoke increases the frequency of respiratory symptoms in adults. 14 In the USA, COPD is a leading cause of death, 15 and the annual COPD death rate has been increasing over the past 20 years. 16 In the UK, male mortality from COPD has been decreasing for 30 years, while female mortality has risen steadily during the same period. 17 In Australia, the per-capita mortality burden of COPD has decreased in males but increased substantially in females. The increasing trend in mortality due to COPD in females found in most developed countries 18 is partly explained by the increasing numbers of female smokers in the preceding few decades. However, in the present study, premature mortality due to COPD showed a steady decline over time in both males and females. The 1996 national survey in China (12) indicated that the prevalence of smoking was 34.1% (63% in men, 3.8% in women). 19 A recent Chinese study indicated that the smoking rate has reduced significantly but was still over 60% in men. 20 Kunming has the largest consumption of tobacco in China. 21 The decrease in YLL due to COPD indicates that there has been some success in smoking control during the period of economic growth. However, the present study found that females had a slightly higher premature mortality burden due to COPD than males throughout the study period, highlighting the importance of risk factors other than smoking for COPD in women.",

The use of solid fuel has also been shown to be an important risk factor for COPD. 22 The nature of this additional aetiologic factor needs to be explored further. This study found an increasing trend in YLL due to IHD, whereas YLL due to stroke fluctuated over time. Deaths due to stroke and IHD have been declining in most developed countries. [23] [24] [25] [26] Stroke mortality has been declining in mainland China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Cuba and Japan. [27] [28] [29] [30] IHD mortality has declined in Japan but is increas-ing in China and shows a plateau in Hong Kong. [31] [32] [33] The contrast between these two diseases suggests that they have different aetiologies and that the control measures will require different approaches.",

            "text": "This study found that the premature mortality burden due to major cancers (stomach cancer, lung cancer and other malignant neoplasms) fluctuated over time. Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in Asia. Its mortality had been decreasing in Korea and Japan 34,35 before introduction of mass vaccination against hepatitis B. 36 Unfortunately, this study and a previous Chinese study 37 found that deaths due to liver cancer had not decreased in China. Similarly, the declining trend in stomach cancer mortality found in most Asian countries between 1950 and 1999 38 was not seen in this region. Thus, to date, improvements in the Chinese economy have not been followed by an improvement in these two poverty-associated cancers. China may require a longer interval between economic growth and hygienic life style to reduce the transmission of carcinogenic organisms such as hepatitis viruses that cause cancer and helicobacter that leads to stomach cancer. 39 RTAs and self-inflicted injuries are important causes of YLL in the study region. In this study, self-inflicted injuries led to more premature deaths in females than males, whereas deaths due to RTAs were more common in males. Most developed countries, such as Sweden 40 and Spain, 41 exhibit a decreasing trend in RTA mortality, but the trend is increasing in developing countries, such as Thailand 42 and China. 43 Increased number of motor vehicles, speed, alcohol and a mixture of road users are known risk factors for RTAs in developing countries. 44 In China, approximately 70% of RTAs are related to bicycles, and prehospital emergency treatment is an effective method to reduce RTA deaths. 45 Despite the fact that economic growth has resulted in more high speed vehicles in China, the reduction in YLL due to RTAs indicates a positive trend in this context.",
