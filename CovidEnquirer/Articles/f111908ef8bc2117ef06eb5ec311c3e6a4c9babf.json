As part of the routine Hajj programme, 25 hospitals at the holy sites will provide a total of 5250 acute clinical care beds-4200 specialised, 500 critical care, and 550 emergency beds-and more than 22 500 health practitioners and Ministry of Health staff will be on duty for the entire Hajj period, Oct 13-16. Additionally, a team from the WHO Regional Offi ce for the Eastern Mediterranean will provide technical support on appropriate public health preparedness measures. 4 The medical services described are off ered free of charge to all pilgrims who require medical care. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has urged all pilgrims' home countries to strengthen their surveillance systems to ensure early detection of any possible cases among returning pilgrims.",
