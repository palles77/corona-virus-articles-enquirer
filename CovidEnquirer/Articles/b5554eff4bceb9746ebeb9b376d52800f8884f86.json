Influenza A subtypes are named according to which subtypes of H and N they possess. These antigens alter over time by a process of drift, or repeated minor mutations that occur over time, or shift, or major change in the antigens, which occurs when two different influenza viruses are simultaneously in a host and recombine. [2] [3] [4] [5] Influenza may be transmitted by aerosols, large droplets, and direct and indirect contact. 6 The relative importance of these modes is considered debatable. 7 The virus can survive on non-porous surfaces for up to 48 h and on unwashed hands for 30 min. 8 Both seasonal and Pandemic H 1 N 1 Influenza 2009 outbreaks failed to demonstrate significant airborne transmission over long distances, but aerosol transmission may occur in confined spaces, especially when a large airborne infectious burden is present. 7, 9 What is pandemic influenza, and what is the difference between it and seasonal influenza",

If a pandemic is defined merely by the spread of a new influenza virus strain around the world, the effects of having the formal declaration in place may disproportionately affect the function of society in the event of a mild illness. Criteria also need to be developed for declaring a pandemic 'over'. In the case of Pandemic H 1 N 1 2009, countries around the world ceased epidemiological tracking of the infection when it became ubiquitous. Thus there is a need to establish international consensus on the formal definition and criteria for pandemic influenza to allow appropriate response to an outbreak, and to determine when declarations of pandemic may be lifted.",

It addressed local community empowerment, recommending planning with community leaders and groups. Social distancing was identified as an important prevention strategy.

Increased cleaning, security and crowd management capacity was identified in the plans, along with the need to increase morgue and laboratory capacity. More non-medical staff are required for administration, communication, transportation, security, cleaning and garbage disposal, and for crowd control. Surge capacity applies across the entire community, with health, government and community groups required to act cooperatively. When individual hospitals reach capacity they need to have means to move patients and/or services to other hospitals or centres. [29] [30] [31] Healthcare worker illness needs to be planned for with use of agency, retired staff, and volunteers. 14 Seasonal influenza seasons have highlighted a lack of surge capacity in emergency departments (EDs). 32 The literature shows that pandemic planning and management are complex, expensive and difficult.",

Prior to the outbreak, the ship procedures already included point-of-care testing, antiviral medication and isolation for ILI patients. However, not all ill passengers sought medical care, presumably because they had mild illness or were unwilling to be isolated while holidaying. After disembarkation, passengers discovered their need to be quarantined via media reports, word of mouth, from ship staff or public heath staff. Almost all complied with quarantine requirements, and only one case of infection passed from a passenger to another person was found, with no further community spread. Thus, an epidemic on board ships was prevented from contributing to the 2009 Pandemic.",

Additionally, droplet precautions add patient isolation or cohorting and minimising patient transfers. Particulate respirators, eye protection, and impervious gowns and gloves, are advised for all aerosol-generating procedures, which should be performed in a negative pressure room if available. 7, 41, 58, 59 Australian guidelines recommend surgical masks for those entering an infectious area, coming within 1 m 57 or 2 m 7 of an infectious patient. Where tolerated, masking the patient is more effective than masking the health care workers. 60 Personal protective equipment is vital to healthcare workers who cannot be protected in any other way prior to effective vaccine development. In 2009, slow distribution of personal protective equipment from the national stockpile to frontline workers was a problem, with general practitoner practices running out of stock and being unable to replace it early in the pandemic. 35 While the CDC recommends the use of respiratory protection of at least the equivalent of N95 masks 61 for health care workers managing patients with ILI, Canadian research has found N95 masks are no more protective in influenza than normal surgical masks. 62 Inconsistencies in recommendations between authorities must be resolved to improve staff compliance and confidence. 63 Thus the literature calls for better distribution of personal protective equipment during an influenza pandemic and identifies research is required into appropriate mask usage.",

            "text": "Treatment for pandemic influenza is a matter of conjecture until the actual virus is identified and the clinical profile emerges. Most Pandemic H 1 N 1 Influenza 2009 cases required simple supportive treatment including rest, fluids, and antipyretics, 34 however advanced oxygenation therapy including high-frequency oscillation ventilation, nitric oxide or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required for some with severe disease. Stockpiled ventilators were too old or too simple to provide complex ventilation strategies. [76] [77] [78] [79] Debate occurred about the efficacy of oseltamivir for the treatment and prevention of Pandemic H 1 N 1 Influenza 2009. The Cochrane Review concluding it merely shortened the duration of symptoms by 24 h if given within 48 h of disease onset, and thus should only be given to those sufferers with known risk factors for severe disease 80-82 especially as side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms and headaches, with rare cases of delirium and psychosis (most frequently in children and adolescents), raised liver enzymes, and allergic reactions. 83 Guidelines recommend oseltamivir administration within 48 h of disease onset. 83 Adherence to this would have seen many treated for a disease they did not have in the H 1 N 1 influenza 2009 pandemic, as overwhelmed pathology services saw extended time lags between specimens being sent for testing and the arrival of results. 33",

While the disease itself was less virulent than expected, it confirmed the unpredictability of pandemic influenza, and its ability to cause significant impacts on health systems and the community. The H 1 N 1 influenza 2009 pandemic highlighted unresolved challenges identified in both Exercise Cumpston 06 and Exercise Sustain 08, which we as a profession and society must address. Public health challenges include developing means of increasing acceptance of influenza vaccination by both the general public and healthcare workers, provision of targeted education for the indigenous population and other at-risk groups, improving public knowledge of social distancing and personal hygiene measures in the prevention of transmission, and improving dissemination of information during a pandemic, especially via the media. We can use the evidence to refine pandemic plans and promote community well-being during an influenza pandemic.",
