New pathogens have been identified (human metapneumoviruses and the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] [SARS-CoV]). The relentless emergence of antigenic variation among influenza viruses continues, but progress is being made in prevention and control of disease in children through active immunoprophylaxis (trivalent inactivated vaccine, live attenuated vaccine) and new antiviral agents (neuraminidase inhibitors). RSV causes two to three times more pediatric hospitalizations than influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumoviruses. Important advances in control of RSV infections among high-risk patients have been achieved using passive immunoprophylaxis despite slow progress in vaccine development. This article reviews current understanding of the major causes of viral respiratory tract disease with an emphasis on prevention and control.",

The pathogen was named chimpanzee coryza agent because it was initially isolated from chimps with coryza. A similar virus soon was isolated from a child with pneumonia, and the name was changed to RSV, reflecting the tendency of RSV-infected cells in vitro to fuse and form syncytia. RSV is a nonsegmented, negative strand RNA virus that encodes for 10 viral proteins. Two subgroups of RSV (A and B) each with multiple genotypes may circulate during annual outbreaks, although it has not been possible to associate more severe disease with one subgroup or another on a consistent basis [2, 3] .",

The outcome of RSV infection varies from mild upper respiratory tract infection, which occurs in approximately 75% of infected infants, to severe life-threatening disease in a small percentage of patients [4] . Each year in the United States, RSV accounts for 50% to 90% of the approximately 120,000 hospitalizations attributable to bronchiolitis and 20% to 50% of pediatric hospitalizations attributable to pneumonia [5] . During the 17-year period between 1980 and 1996, hospitalization rates for bronchiolitis in infants younger than 12 months old increased by more than twofold, whereas hospitalization rates for other respiratory diseases (pneumonia, asthma) showed little change [5] . Approximately 500 RSV-associated deaths occur each year in the United States, and most occur in non-high-risk patients [6] . Outbreaks of nosocomial RSV disease on pediatric wards continue to be a serious problem when effective infection control policies are not followed [7] . Serologic surveys show that by 2 years of age, more than 90% of children have been infected by RSV at least once. Reinfection throughout life is common, indicating that immunity to RSV after natural infection is inadequate. Whether RSV infection early in life predisposes to subsequent reactive airway disease is an important but unresolved question [8] .",

Premature infants and infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity constitute high-risk groups with rates of RSV hospitalization that are approximately five times the hospitalization rate in fullterm, healthy infants [9] . Several factors place preterm infants at risk for severe RSV disease, including a relative lack of maternal antibodies, an immature immune response, and underdeveloped lungs with small bronchioles and reduced pulmonary reserve [10] . Transfer of maternal antibodies occurs mainly after the 28th week of pregnancy, so infants born before this time are likely to have lower antibody concentrations. In addition, maternal antibody concentrations to RSV show seasonal variation, and infants born in the early fall or soon after the start of the respiratory virus season are more likely to be born to mothers with low serum antibody concentrations [11] . A low concentration of antibody to RSV correlates with susceptibility to severe RSV in infants [12] .",

These variations occur, however, within the overall pattern of RSV outbreaks, usually beginning in November or December, peaking in January or February, and ending by the end of March or by April [15] .

Aerosolized ribavirin was licensed in 1986 for treatment of children hospitalized with severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection. Because of high cost and conflicting data regarding efficacy, however, this drug is not widely used. A vaccine remains the most practical means of reducing the burden of disease attributable to RSV, but it has proved difficult to develop an effective vaccine for young infants that produces protective immunity but does not enhance natural infection [16] . In contrast, remarkable progress has been achieved in showing the efficacy, ease of administration, and safety of passive immunoprophylaxis against RSV. In slightly more than 10 years, the field of passive immunoprophylaxis has evolved from clinical trials with standard intravenous immunoglobulin to the use of a RSV-hyperimmune, polyclonal intravenous globulin (RespiGam) to an intramuscular, humanized murine monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) directed against a conserved epitope on the fusion glycoprotein [4, 17] .",

Household crowding seems to be another important risk factor for severe viral lower respiratory illness including that caused by RSV. As the number of household members increases, the risk of exposure to infectious respiratory secretions also increases. Numerous other risk factors have been associated with severe RSV disease, including gender (males N females), low socioeconomic status, daycare attendance, exposure to passive smoke, lack of breastfeeding, limited maternal education, and malnutrition. These factors have an inconsistent association with hospitalization across studies, however, and at most account for only a modest increase in risk [10, 21] .

The segmented genome is one of the key features explaining the ability of influenza viruses to undergo antigenic change and cause annual outbreaks of disease. Influenza viruses are classified as one of three types (A, B, C) based on antigenic differences in the nucleocapsid protein. Type A strains infect humans and animals and are associated with the most severe disease, causing epidemics and pandemics on a worldwide basis. Influenza A viruses are categorized further into subtypes based on two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Type B strains tend to cause less severe illness than type A, do not circulate in animals, and are not categorized into subtypes. Type C strains cause mild disease and have little public health impact.",

Antigenic drift refers to mutations (nucleotide substitutions or deletions) in the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase genes. Selective pressure favors the emergence of antigenically altered strains as an increasing number of individuals in the community develop antibody against the circulating strain. New antigenic stains emerge, circulate, and are replaced by the next emerging strain against which the population has limited immunity. Depending on the extent of antigenic variation from strain to strain, the new circulating virus may cause more or less severe outbreaks of disease.",

Families with school-age children are twice as likely to experience influenza than families with older children, reflecting the importance of young children in transmission of influenza in a community. Influenza is highly contagious, and secondary spread to adults in the same household is common. Patients may be infectious for 24 hours before the onset of symptoms and continue to shed virus in nasal secretions for about 5 days after onset of symptoms. Young children may shed virus for longer periods. Annual outpatient visits because of complications of influenza vary from 6 to 29 per 100 children depending on the virulence of the circulating strain and the relatedness between the vaccine and the circulating strains. Complications from influenza infections are estimated to account for a 10% to 30% increase in antibiotic courses in infected children.

When vaccine and epidemic strains are well matched, the vaccine confers protection in 70% to 90% of vaccinees. The optimal time for vaccination is between the beginning of October and the end of November. Vaccine should be offered throughout the influenza season as long as vaccine is available and until virus is no longer circulating (Box 1). Protective antibodies develop within 2 weeks after vaccination. The immunogenicity of a single dose of vaccine in young children is limited, especially if they have not been vaccinated previously or infected by influenza virus. Two doses of intramuscular vaccine should be administered at least 1 month apart to children younger than 9 years old ( Table 2 ). The duration of immunity is likely to be less Box 1. Target groups for influenza vaccination 1. Chronic pulmonary disorders, including asthma 2. Hemodynamically significant heart disease 3. Regular medical follow-up or hospitalization in the past year for any of the following: Metabolic disease, including diabetes mellitus Renal dysfunction Hemoglobinopathy Immunosuppression due to medical therapy or HIV infection 4.

Hospitalization rates secondary to influenza in infants younger than 6 months old may be greater than 10 per 1000 [25] . Influenza vaccine is not recommended for this age group, however, because it has not been evaluated in such young children. It is important to vaccinate the contacts of these young, at-risk infants. The most frequent side effect of vaccination is soreness at the vaccination site, which occurs in 10% to 64% of vaccinees. Fever, malaise, and myalgia occur most often in young children who have had no previous exposure to influenza virus antigens.",

Temperature-sensitive strains preferentially replicate at the lower temperature of the nasal cavity and less efficiently at core body temperature. Intranasal administration of vaccine results in a subclinical infection that induces immunity by simulating a natural infection of the upper airways. This vaccine was approved as an alternative to TIV for healthy persons 5 to 49 years old. It is likely that approval will be extended beyond these age limits. The advantages of LAIV are avoidance of intramuscular injection and possibly greater protection against mutated strains than that found with TIV [23, 28] . LAIV should not be used to immunize persons who have close contact with severely immunocompromised patients who require isolation [23] . Antiviral drugs for treatment or prophylaxis are not a substitute for vaccination. Four influenza antiviral drugs are presently licensed in the United States: amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, and oseltamivir. Three drug are approved for treatment of influenza in children younger than 13 years old (Table 4) . When therapy is initiated within the first 2 days of illness, all four medications are similarly effective in reducing the duration of symptoms by about 1 day [23, 26] . Antiviral therapy with oseltamivir or zanamivir has been shown to decrease influenza-associated otitis media and antibiotic use in children. Amantadine, rimantadine, and oseltamivir are the three antiviral medications approved for chemoprophylaxis of influenza in children [23, 26, 29] . Any person 1 year old or older experiencing a potentially life-threatening infection should be treated with antiviral medication. Any person 1 year old or older who is at risk of serious complications of influenza should be treated with antiviral medication, ideally within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Treatment of persons who do not have conditions placing them at greater risk of serious complications also may benefit from antiviral therapy begun within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. For treatment of illness resulting from influenza A or if the type is unknown, oseltamivir or zanamivir is recommended to reduce the risk of development of amantadine-resistant isolates, which could be transmitted to contacts [26, 30, 31] .",

            "text": "Influenza pandemics refer to the sudden emergence and rapid spread throughout the world of a new strain of influenza virus that causes extensive social disruption and severe disease with increased mortality relative to typical annual epidemics. Three influenza pandemics occurred in the last century ( Table 5 ). The occurrence of the next pandemic seems to be inevitable. Estimates from the CDC project that 200 million people may be infected during the next pandemic. Between 300,000 and 800,000 persons in the United States may re- quire hospitalization, resulting in 88,000 to 300,000 deaths. Because pandemic strains typically appear in the United States less than 6 months after detection elsewhere in the world, vaccine may be unavailable or in limited supply. Health care workers are at increased risk of early exposure and may become ill before much of the general population, compromising the delivery of health care. Type A influenza virus is capable of infecting numerous different animal species, including birds, pigs, horses, whales, and humans. Birds are considered to be the natural host of influenza viruses because all known subtypes of influenza A have been isolated from birds. Wild birds generally do not develop symptoms when infected by influenza virus. In contrast, domesticated birds, such as chickens or turkeys, often become sick or die when infected. Influenza virus survives in the intestine and is spread in the saliva, nasal secretions, and feces of infected birds, although fecal-oral spread of virus among susceptible birds is the most common route of transmission. Transmission of avian influenza directly from birds to humans generally does not occur. The first reported instance of human infection by avian influenza A (H5N1) occurred in Hong Kong in 1997. During this outbreak, 18 people were infected, and 6 died. Killing 1.5 million chickens in Hong Kong removed the reservoir of virus and helped control the outbreak. In early 2004, widespread outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 occurred in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. More than 100 million birds died or were killed to control the outbreak. In summer 2004, a second wave of disease due to H5N1 was reported among poultry in China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. If H5N1 strains acquire the ability for efficient human-to-human transmission, this strain could cause the next pandemic. The CDC recommends testing for H5N1 strains in patients with radiographically confirmed pneumonia or severe respiratory illness for whom a diagnosis has not been established and who have a history of travel within 10 days of onset of symptoms to a country with documented H5N1 avian influenza in poultry.",

Although the most serious lower respiratory tract infections occur in children in the first year of life, symptomatic reinfection by human metapneumovirus seems to be common. Risk factors for severe human metapneumovirus disease are similar to the risk factors associated with severe RSV illness. Most cases of lower tract disease occur before 12 months of age, although the median age of human metapneumovirus-infected children in one study of hospitalized patients was greater than the age of RSV-infected children (3 months versus 11.5 months) [35] . Similar to RSV, the incidence of human metapneumovirus infection is greatest during the winter and early spring months, although human metapneumovirus activity seems to peak later in the season than the peak in RSV activity.
