Chemical Engineering is a young profession in Hong Kong with the baccalaureate degree program established in 1993. Despite the lack of traditional chemical industries in Hong Kong, graduates easily find a career in many chemical-related industries and businesses including food and beverage, textiles and clothing, pharmaceuticals and electronics. However, most of these industries emphasize on product rather than process, therefore a good background in product-oriented design is a must. The proximity to inexpensive labor and growing consumer market in China give our students the unprecedented opportunity to establish their own business and enterprise. A basic training in entrepreneurship will be invaluable. Indeed, several alumni had successfully started their own chemical business and manufacturing plant in China. ",

The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE) registered thirty chartered chemical engineers and ninety-three chartered gas engineers. It is estimated that there are about 3000-5000 trained chemical engineers in Hong Kong. The lack of natural resources and high cost of land preclude the construction of large chemical and petrochemical plants in Hong Kong, instead small and medium scale fuel and gas processing plants supplied the local needs. There are more than eleven hundreds chemical and plastic companies and businesses in Hong Kong employing roughly fifteen thousand peoples [3] . Many chemical engineers are employed in local utility companies responsible for Towngas production, electricity generation and water and wastewater treatments. Others contribute to the growth of the local textile and electronic industries that accounts for a third of the employment in manufacturing sector. Chemical engineers are heavily involved in the modernization and mass production of traditional Chinese medicine, food and beverages. Kong. An increasing number of chemical engineers are employed in local and multi-national companies with production facilities in China. It is expected that greater demand for chemical engineer will follow upon completion of several major refineries and chemical plants in neighboring Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi and Fujien.

The Chemical Engineering department started accepting students in 1993, two years after the University opened its door to students in 1991. The Chemical Engineering undergraduate degree programs are accredited by the Institute of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) of U.K. and the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers. The latter is a signatory to the Washington Accord and therefore all engineering degrees accredited by the HKIE are recognized by the other signatories. Chemical Engineering education faces unique challenges and opportunities in Hong Kong. The lack of traditional chemical industries and the rapid pace of de-industrialization bring into question the relevance of traditional Chemical Engineering curriculum in Hong Kong.

A typical Hong Kong household has an average of 3.2 family members and lives in a high-rise apartment of an average size of 40 m 2 . A medium-sized, HK apartment building houses around 200 families and poor indoor air quality is a growing concern of the residents. Many reports [9] showed that indoor air quality could be ten times worse than outdoor because of poor air ventilation. This can be vividly experienced by simply strolling down an apartment corridor, where one is assaulted with a riot of odors from cooking, incenses, smokes, deodorizers and disinfectants. Hong Kong has a humid weather with average relative humidity of about 80 % throughout the year [10] . Summer is hot and humid with a monthly rainfall of more than 300 mm. The humidity encourages the growth of fungi and mildews, those spores can triggers allergic reaction and even asthma.",

The mechanical air cleaners use filters to trap and remove the particles from air drawn in by the appliance. They often employ medium-to high-efficiency filters that have rated efficiency between 20-60 %. The filters are either disposable or reusable (i.e., washable filters). The high-efficiency filters are often mistakenly marketed as HEPA-type filter. The characteristics of true HEPA filter are summarized in Table 10 . Air cleaners that employ electrostatic precipitators and ionizers to remove airborne particles are categorized as electronic air cleaners. Electrostatic precipitators use a small electrical charge to collect particles from air pulled through the device, while ionizers produce negative ions that causes airborne particles to stick to materials around the vicinity of the appliance. Table 12 .5-3 lists their respective strengths and weaknesses. Odors associated with gaseous pollutants are often treated by adsorption on activated carbons and charcoals. Permanganate-coated alumina is known to be also effective in removing persistent odors. Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) using UV-irradiated TiO 2 catalyst is popular in Japan for treating organic air pollutants and is proven effective for smokes and odors. UV-irradiation is also known to inactivate a wide-range of bacteria, fungi, spores and viruses. Ozone air treatment devices are still popular in Asia despite the established health risks associated with this technology. A comparison of the various technologies is shown in Table 12 .5-3.",

The carbon dioxide measurement was included as an indicator for the adequacy of ventilation. Measurements were conducted over a period of five days at each selected sites with the permission of residents. One day is needed to set up and calibrate the equipments. Real time monitoring of the temperature, humidity, aerosol, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and formaldehyde were conducted at each sites for the next 72 hours using equipments listed in Table 12 .4-3. The air samplings for formaldehyde, TVOC and bioaerosols were done when the residents were away from home to avoid inconvenience. The formaldehyde and total VOCs were sampled using sorbent tubes and analyzed in the Applied Technology Center (ATC) laboratory using gas chromatography. Airborne bacteria and fungal spores were sampled using Andersen-type bioaerosol impactor using tryptic soy agar (TSA) and malt extract agar (MEA) plates, respectively. The viable colonies were counted after sample incubation. The residents were interviewed on the last day before the equipments were disassembled and removed. The carbon monoxide level is low for apartments with separate kitchen area, but at site 4 where the kitchen is attached to the living room, the carbon monoxide level is high and exceeds the recommended level when the residents were cooking. The formaldehyde, benzene, toluene and xylene levels are low as no recent renovations were done and all residents were nonsmokers. The survey results were in good agreement with a more detailed air quality survey of twenty Hong Kong apartment homes (Table 12 .6-6) commissioned by the team with funding from the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Commission.",

The high level of carbon monoxide produced during cooking must be addressed. Odors are the most common complaints from the residents despite the recorded low level of VOCs. This is understandable since the threshold odor for most of these compounds is very low. The team therefore recommends that the product should feature aerosols (i.e., dust and particulates), bioaerosols (i.e., airborne bacteria and fungi), carbon monoxide and odor (i.e., VOCs) removal technologies.

Ceramic monoliths with cell densities of 25 to 1600 cells per square inch (i.e., cell sizes of 5 -0.6 mm) are routinely made by extrusions. The process involves powder blending, pugging, extrusion, cutting, drying and sintering to produce the final monolith. Powder preparation is considered to be the most critical step in monolith forming. The catalyst being sensitive to many of the chemical additives and processing steps used in the extrusion process would be separated coated onto the prepared monolith. The adsorbent and desiccants are of different sizes and proper mixing, grinding and screening are needed to produce a free-flowing powder of narrow particle size distribution. Particle sizes larger than 5 microns are not suitable for extrusion. Computer software loaned by Prof. K.M. Ng groups provided a guide for powder processing. The recommended process for obtaining 2 microns powder is shown in Fig. 12 .7-4. Suitable binder, surfactant, deflocculant, coagulant, lubricant, plasticizer, and preservative are needed to prepare an extrudable mixture. Unfortunately, the high cost of extrusion die prevented the team from producing their own monolith, instead commercial desiccant monoliths were purchased and coated with the low-temperature catalyst and regenerable VOC adsorbent.

Dehumidification discourages microbial growth in particular mildews and fungi. It also safeguards the performance of the catalyst-adsorbent wheel by removing moistures that may interfere with the catalyst and adsorbent. The use of two wheels design solves material compatibility problems and allowed independent performance optimization. However, the design is complicated and expensive. Figure 12. 8-4 displays a schematic flow diagram of the product design 1. The air is drawn-in through a washable, coarse filter (1) that removes particles larger than 10 microns and a disposable high efficiency filter (2) that removes 95 percent of particles with size down to 0.3 microns. The filtered air flows through a desiccant wheel (3) decreasing the relative humidity of the air to below 50 percent. A second set of wheel (4) coated the low temperature VOCs oxidation catalyst based on nanostructured catalyst converts organic pollutants into harmless carbon dioxide and water at ambient temperature. The wheel was also coated with regenerable VOCs adsorbent made from modified mesoporous silica to capture excess VOCs. The clean, dry air leaving the catalyst-adsorbent wheel flows past the air-cooled condenser before leaving the unit. A second stream of air with flow rate one-twentieth of the main airstream was heated and used to regenerate the catalyst-adsorbent and desiccant wheels. The heated air desorbs the organic pollutants captured in the adsorbent. The elevated temperature increases the catalyst activity enabling complete oxidation of the desorbed VOCs. The heated air then enters the desiccant wheel desorbing the adsorbed water and regenerating the desiccant. The hot, moist air is guided into an air-cooled condenser where water is condensed and collected in a reservoir pan. The two air streams are mixed and guided through a baffle before exiting the unit.",

The adsorbents are coated along two-thirds of the wheel thickness and all catalysts are concentrated on one face of the wheel away from the entry point of the main airstream. This is a simpler design using less component parts and therefore cheaper to manufacture.

Since all the modification was restricted to the wheel, prototype design 3 allowed us to simply use the existing commercial appliance design. The dehumidifier was first test run under different operating conditions and the airflow, temperature and humidity at different locations within the appliance were measured and recorded. The airflow, temperature and humidity profiles were used to calculate the optimum quantities and distributions of catalysts and adsorbents in the wheel (Fig. 12.8-6 ). The wheel was replaced in the dehumidifier appliance and tested with sensors inserted at the locations shown in Fig. 12.8-11 . The results show that the airflows and temperatures remained within normal operating values. Laboratory and field tests were conducted and the results are reported in the next section. Eight desiccant-based dehumidifiers (RV-DA60-HC) made by the Japanese company Zojirushi (Fig. 12.9-1a) were purchased with the help of Chiaphua Industries Ltd. The appliance was designed for dehumidification of a 60 m 2 room at rate of 3.36 L/day when the relative humidity (R.H.) is 50 %. Its airflow can adjusted between 65 and 85 m 3 /h (i.e., 40 to 50 scfm). The normal outlet air temperature is 35 \u00baC, but can reach temperatures up to 56 \u00baC at high-speed setting. Measuring 48 cm in height and 27 cm in width and breadth, the dehumidifier weighs only 6.5 Kg. The main components are air blower, desiccant wheel and motor, air heater, air-cooled condenser, water basin, power supply and a processor-based control unit. The operating parameters including heater temperature, heating rate, desiccant wheel rotation and air blower speed were pre-programmed and cannot be changed without triggering the safety routine that disables the appliance. Twelve grams of formulated catalyst was wash-coated on the desiccant wheel of the dehumidifier (Fig. 12.9 -1b) to impart air purification function. The modified dehumidifier will be henceforth referred to as the Prototype Unit.",

The chamber was filled with the target VOCs through two stage saturators shown in Fig. 32b . Once the VOC level in the chamber stabilized, the fan was turned on to circulate the air through the sample. Three sets of sensors were located at the inlet and outlet of the holder, as well as in the center of the chamber. The chamber temperature and relative humidity were kept constant during the test. Figure 12 .9-6c shows the results for VOC levels of 4000, 2000 and 1000 ppb at room temperature. The reduction rate was slower because of the low VOC concentration and the poor air circulation in the chamber. Also unlike the Prototype Unit, the catalyst was kept at room temperature throughout the test.",

Circular pieces of filter papers (5 mm diameter) were saturated with distilled water (positive control); bleach solution (negative control), 75 % alcohol and different concentration of TiO 2 . The TiO 2 has similar germicidal effectiveness as 75 % alcohol as shown in Fig. 12.9-7 . This shows that the TiO 2 catalyst support exhibits intrinsic germicidal properties. The intrinsic germicidal property of the TiO 2 support was also tested for natural indoor bioaerosol. A piece of cotton cloth was coated with a colloidal suspension of the nanostructured TiO 2 . After drying, a circular piece of the cloth was cut and fitted inside the Andersen viable single-stage sampler in such a way that air flows through the cloth before impacting on the collection plate. Tryptic soy agar (TSA) and malt extract agar (MEA) plates were respectively used for bacteria and fungi samplings. Two additional Andersen viable single-stage samplers were used to measure the ambient bioaerosol level and the amount of bioaerosol filtered by the cloth. The three samplers were operated at the same time and air samples were collected at 28.3 L/min for five minutes. The total bioaerosol level varied between 200 to 800 CFU/m 3 during the test. Figure 34 shows that the cotton cloth filtered roughly ten percent of the airborne bacteria and fifteen percent of the airborne fungi. These values remained unchanged during the 1 h experiment. TiO 2 deactivates and kills microorganisms by direct contact. Nearly sixty percent reduction of airborne bacteria (Fig. 12.9-8a) was obtained from the TiO 2 -coated cloth at the start of the test. This gradually decreases with time as the TiO 2 was slowly covered with dead microorganisms. Similarly, the forty percent reduction in fungi decreased to thirty percent at the end of the experiment (Fig. 12.9 -8b). Other components of the formulated catalyst were also tested for their germicidal properties. The desiccant is a good bactericide and cloth coated with the desiccant maintained a sixty percent reduction during the entire test as shown in Fig. 12 .9-9a. The desiccant deactivates and kills the bacteria by rapid dehydration. However, this process is not as effective for airborne fungi (Fig.  12.9-9b ). Bioaerosol tests on the Prototype Unit were conducted for B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis. These are common airborne bacteria found in Hong Kong. The tests were conducted in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet at the Applied Technology Center, HKUST. The cabinet was sealed with a plastic curtain and the blower was turned off during the test. Two fifteen millilitres of sterilized distilled water were aerosolised with a nebuliser to adjust the relative humidity inside the cabinet to 80 % in order to minimize the evaporative effect on the aerosolised bacteria. The cabinet was kept at room temperature (i.e., 23-24 o C) for the test. Ten millilitres stock bacteria culture solution (10 7 to 10 8 bacteria per ml) were aerosolised and uniformly dispersed inside the cabinet. Tests were conducted with the Prototype Unit turned on and off (i.e., control test). It is important to note that filter was not installed in the prototype during tests. Air samples were collected at various times using an Andersen viable single-stage sampler placed 60 cm from the Prototype Unit during the ten minutes test run and duplicate tests were carried out to establish reproducibility. The bacteria plates were incubated in a standard incubator at 37\u00b0C for 18 h. The bacterial colonies on each plate were counted as total colony forming unit (CFU).",

The TSA plates were incubated at 37 \u00baC for 24 h and bacterial colonies were counted. The number of fungal colonies was determined from the MEA plates after incubating at 30 \u00baC for 5 days. The results show no viable bacterial and fungal colonies were present in the interior parts of the Prototype Unit. Viable colonies are found on the external surface of the unit.

This was remedied by simply washing the desiccant wheel and by placing a coarse foam filter at the air intake. The Prototype Units were also disassembled and swabbed to check for viable bacteria and fungi. The result is similar to the previous Prototype Unit used in clinic. The number of viable microorganisms is higher at the air intake and close to zero at the desiccant wheel and air outlet. ",

The single catalyst/adsorbent/desiccant wheel has the advantage of simpler design and lower cost. The new prototype design was implemented towards the end of the spring semester and a new team of undergraduate students was recruited to continue the project.Ms. Hazel Lai Wing Yan, Ms. Vivian Chan Ngar Wai, Mr. Kenneth Leung Wai Kin and Mr. Owen Luk Ka Fai were all first year Chemical Engineering students. Mr. Anthony Ng Ka Hang, a graduate of Manufacturing and Industrial Engineering and former employee of Honeywell Consumer Products (HK) Ltd. joined to lead the team of undergraduates and take charge of prototype fabrication and testing. Hazel and Vivian were responsible for the laboratory tests, while Kenneth and Owen carried out the field tests. The FYP students remained for a month to help in the new prototype design and in training the new team. Mr. Victor Lo of Global Manufacturing Services Ltd. and Mr. Eddy Wu of Chiaphua Industries Ltd. remained the project's main industrial partners and consultants.",

The VOC was evaporated and mixed with air before entering the inlet of the Prototype Unit. The inlet and outlet conditions were monitored in real time. The sensors used for the tests are VOC gas sensor Model Type D1 (# TGS 2602) from FIGARO, humidity sensor Model Ceramic SIL (HIH-3605-A) from Honeywell and temperature sensor Model DZ Version (LM35 DZ) from National Semiconductor. The sensor box was designed and built by with collaboration with an Electronic Engineering student at HKUST. The VOC sensors were calibrated against Photoionization Gas Detector Model PGM-30 from RAE using the target VOC. The humidity and temperature sensors were calibrated using VelociCalc Plus Multi-Parameter Ventilation Model (8386-M-GB) from TSI Inc. A set of VOC, humidity and temperature sensors was placed at the inlet and outlet of the Prototype Unit.

The 8-hours average level of respirable suspended particles (RSP) at all four survey sites exceeded the HKEPD's level 1 recommendation.
