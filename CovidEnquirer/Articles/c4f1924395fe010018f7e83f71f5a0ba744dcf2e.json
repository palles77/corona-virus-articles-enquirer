The pathogenesis of AOM is complex and involves interactions between the host, pathogen and environmental factors. Usually, there is a pre-existing nasopharyngeal colonization with pathogenic bacteria. Viral URI causes inflammation of the nasopharynx and Eustachian tubes, which is mediated by substances such as cytokines and inflammatory mediators. The inflammation leads to Eustachian tube dysfunction, which in turn causes a negative pressure in the middle ear allowing the pathogens from the nasopharynx to enter the middle ear resulting in fluid or pus accumulation, thereby causing AOM (1) (2) . However, while nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury during symptomatic viral URI occurs in all children, AOM complication occurs in only about one third of young children. It is likely that more severe nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury leads to higher risk for AOM; however, this postulate has not been studied in clinical setting.",

Schorn et al. have also shown that LDH concentrations in NPS are higher during viral URI than during bacterial, allergic or atrophic rhinitis (5) . The nasopharyngeal cellular injury can arise from a multitude of factors during viral URI; these include direct virus-induced cytopathic injury of the infected cells, and participation of leukocytes such as neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes in both antibody-dependent and -independent cytotoxicity (10) . A variety of chemokines and cytokines, specifically the acute phase cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and other soluble mediators can act on the local endothelial and epithelial tissues to enhance the migration of the leukocytes towards infected epithelial cells, which in turn, participate in the cytotoxic injury of infected cells as well as nearby bystander cells.",
