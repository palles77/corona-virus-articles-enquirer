It shows its effect through immunosuppression and develops persistent infection in calves born from infected cows. The current study revealed that BVDV potentially induced immunosuppression by the interaction of BVDV Npro protein with cellular S100A9 protein. The Inhibition of S100A9 protein expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced the virus replication in infected cells. Overexpression of bovine S100A9 enhanced the ncpBVDV2a 1373 mediated Type-I interferon production. A co-immunoprecipitation experiment demonstrated a strong interaction between ncp BVDV2a 1373 Npro protein and cellular S100A9 protein. This suggested that BVDV Npro reduced the S100A9 protein availability/activity in infected cells, resulting in reduced Type-I interferon production. A further study of S100A9-BVDV interaction will be need for better understanding of BVDV pathophysiology.",

            "text": "The innate immune system is a key component of antiviral defense [1, 2] . Danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), or alarmins [3] [4] [5] plays an important role in innate immunity. DAMPs are intracellular molecules that primarily regulate cell homeostasis, but also act as extracellularly when secreted by activated or damaged cells. The DAMPs interact with Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and initiate the production of cytokines and chemokines, which further amplify the inflammation [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, there is very little known about the role of DAMPs in inflammation or immunity during virus infection. A one protein family of DAMPs, known as S100 (i.e., S100A7, S100A15 [6] , S100A12, S100A8, and S100A9) [7] [8] [9] have shown a direct effect on the innate immune system. The protein S100A9 initiates the immune response through the TLR4/MyD88 pathway [10] . S100A9 is expressed by a variety of cell types including neutrophils, dendritic cells, monocytes and endothelial cells [10] [11] [12] [13] . Activation of TLR4/MyD88 pathway by S100A9 triggers the downstream signaling cascade, leading to the activation of nuclear factor-\u043aB (NF-\u043aB), and subsequently activates type 1 interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) [7, 9] .",

It an immunosuppressive virus and one of the major threats to the cattle industry worldwide [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . BVDV has a positive sense single stranded RNA genome with the size of 12.3 Kb [19] . The genome is translated into a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes approximately 4000 codons comprising 10 to 11 posttranslational cleaved proteins [17, 19] . The polyprotein is cleaved into 4 structural proteins [e.g. Erns, envelope proteins E1, E2, and capsid protein (C)] and 7 to 8 nonstructural proteins (e.g. Npro, p7, NS2-3 or NS2 and NS3, NS4A NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) by viral or/and host cell proteases [17, 19, 20] . The Flaviviridae family also includes Flavivirus and Hepacivirus genus. The Flavivirus genus has viruses with zoonotic importance, such as West Nile virus and dengue virus while Hepacivirus genus comprised solely of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [21, 22] . Of the three Flaviviridae genuses, the Pestivirus genome is unique because it encodes two proteins (e.g. Npro and Erns) that are not present in the other genus in Flaviviridae family [23] . Npro is the first protein coded in the ORF, which has protease activity, but is not necessary for viral replication [24, 25] . Npro interferes with the innate immune mechanisms through inhibiting type one interferon (e.g. interferon alpha and beta: FN-\u03b1/\u03b2) in cell culture [23, 26, 27] . This inhibition is potentially associated with the immunotolerance and development of persistent infection (PI) in BVDV infection [25] .",

Similarly, a BVDV virus with mutations in both the Npro protease coding sequence as well as the Erns RNase region, failed to induce PI in calves [29] . The Npro potentially reduces type I IFN by decreasing interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3). The phosphorylation of IRF-3 resulted in its conformational change with increased binding ability to DNA. Phosphorylated IRF-3 binding to DNA up-regulated the IRF-3 transcriptional as well as interferon (IFN)-responsive genes to produce type I IFN [30, 31] . While, BVDV Npro decreased the IRF-3 level via proteasomal degradation, leading to decreased expression of type I IFN [32, 33] .",

Immunoprecipitation procedures were performed as previously described by Free et al. [40] . Briefly, 293T cells were plated in six, 6-well plates for 24 h before transfection. The plates were then divided into two groups with three plates each for three replicates. One group was transfected with p3XFLAG-Npro, while the other group was transfected with empty p3XFLAG, as described above. Twenty-four hr after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed using in 1 ml of ice-cold in-house solubilization/lysis buffer (50 mM [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid: HEPES], 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, and 40 mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 ) with pH of 7.4 containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and pre-cleared using protein G magnetic beads (Dynabeads \u00ae Protein G., Life Technologies) by incubation for 10 min at room temperature. The protein G magnetic beads were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000-2500 \u00d7 g and the supernatant was collected. The supernatants were then transferred into clean tubes with 100 \u03bcl of murine anti-FLAG IgG1 mAb-agarose slurrybeads (Sigma-Aldrich, Louis, MO). The mixture was incubated on a rocking platform overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml ice-cold solubilization/lysis buffer. Finally, the proteins were eluted from the samples and the control beads by adding 5 packed gel volumes of 0.1 M glycine HCl buffer, pH 3.0. (Life Technologies, CA). The collected proteins were stored at \u221220\u00b0C for further use.",

It was reconfirmed by western blot analysis demonstrated cellular S1009A protein interaction with BVDV Npro protein. Additionally, Table 1 Cellular protein interactions with ncp BVDV2 1373 Npro protein. A total 30 proteins were co-immunoprecipitated in the cells transfected with p3XFLAG (control) or p3XFLAG-Npro plasmid, using anti-FLAG antibody. The comparison between these two groups revealed a total of sixteen proteins which were present in p3XFLAG-Npro transfected cells that were absent in p3XFLAG transfected cells. The proteins are ranked according to mass spectrometry score e.g. highest to lowest in the SiRNA-knockdown experiments showed a significant increase in BVDV titers (p < 0.05) by more than one log in S100A9 knock down cells at 24 h post infection while overexpression of S100A9 enhanced type 1 interferon production, indicating a functional relationship between BVDV pathogenesis and cellular S100A9 protein.",

Modified live BVDV cp strains caused a decrease in circulating lymphocytes and neutrophils and also suppressed neutrophil functions [58, 59] . These effects could be explained by the interaction of S100A9 with the virus Npro, as S100A9 has a major role in the migration of phagocytes [60, 61] and neutrophil oxidative burst [62] . Additionally, an important sequela of BVDV infection is the increase in secondary bacterial infection [63] . Interaction of Npro with S100A9 protein could have potent antimicrobial and chemotactic effects that could increase the incidence of secondary infections [60] . S100A8/S100A9 functions as an endogenous TLR4 ligand that is essential to the amplification of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects on phagocytes upstream of TNF-\u03b1 [64] . One study showed a decline in S100A8/S100A9 levels in patients that survived sepsis, whereas nonsurvivors had increased serum levels of S100A8/S100A9 [65] . This higher mortality with BVDV mucosal disease where sudden death often occurs could also be due to an increase level of S100A9 that amplifies the inflammatory response, thus increasing the chance of endotoxic shock. The interaction of BVDV Npro with S100A9 found in this study creates several questions that need to be answered regarding BVDV pathogenesis and role of DAMPs in viral infection.",

Interaction of BVDV Npro with cellular S100A9 protein, potentially reduced its availability/activity in virus infected cells leading to reduced type 1 interferon production and higher virus production. 5 . Overexpression of bovine S100A9 counteract the interferon Type-I interferon (IFN \u03b1/\u03b2) inhibition induced by ncp BVDV2a 1373. The S100A9 over expressed or S100A9 knock out cells were infected with ncp BVDV2a-1373 with MOI of 5 for 24 h while control cells were mock treated or treated with poly I:C. After 24 h infection/treatment, supernatant was collected and examined for type 1 interferon expression through firefly luciferase activity in NCL-1-ISRE-Luc-Hygro cells. The control cell treated with poly I:C, S100A9 over expressed or S100A9 knock out cells infected with ncp BVDV2a-1373 showed significantly higher IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 as compare to mock-infected/treated control cell {*}, p < 0.05. While S100A9 overexpressed cells infected with ncp BVDV2a-1373 had significantly higher IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 as compared to S100A9 knock out cells infected with ncp BVDV2a-1373 or cells treated with poly I:C {**}, p < 0.05.",
