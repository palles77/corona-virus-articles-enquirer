Therefore neuraminidase from [3H]palmitic acid labeled FPV was prepared by the method described by Huang et al. (1979) . However, this preparation also failed to afford significant radioactivity (not shown). It was therefore concluded that neuraminidase of FPV is free of fatty acids. While analogous results were received with FPV strain Dutch, in the case of virus N and human influenza viruses grown in chick cells fatty acids were found to be attached to the noncleaved hemagglutinin (HA) (Fig. 1, right panel, lane N) . This indicates that cleavage of HA is not required for the biosynthetic acylation. In order to determine to which portions of HA fatty acids were attached, these viruses were labeled in the presence of trypsin in the medium which leads to the specific cleavage of the hemagglutinin to yield HA1 and HA2 (Klenk et al., 1975; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975) . SDS-gel analysis of particles grown under such conditions revealed that, as with FPV and the Dutch strain of fowl plague virus, fatty acid label was bound exclusively to HA2. This is shown in Fig. 2 for the hemagglutinin subtypes HO, H2, and H3. The same result was obtained also for the HA of Hl subtype in the human influenza strain FM1 (not shown).",

In contrast all the lipids of the viral and the cellular membranes are readily extracted with this organic solvent (see lanes 2 and 5 in Fig. 3 ). Only treatment with 0.2iV potassium hydroxide in methanol at room temperature leads to a release of fatty For comparison, fatty acid-labeled virus N was treated with aqueous or methanolic potassium hydroxide for various periods of time and subsequently analyzed on acrylamide gels. It was found that the methanolic environment facilitates the release of fatty acid from the hemagglutinin spike glycoprotein. As shown in Fig.  4 a 2-min treatment with methanolic KOH is sufficient to liberate all rH]palmitic acid radioactivity from the hemagglutinin whereas in the aqueous medium 15-30 min are required to initiate the cleavage of fatty acids from the glycoprotein. This is taken as an indication that the fatty acid attachment site may be closely associated with the viral lipid bilayer. Methanol, in contrast to water, possibly perturbs the viral envelope and thereby renders fatty acid binding portions of the protein more easily accessible to potassium hydroxide. It should be noted that alkali treatment has no effect on the polypeptide backbone of the glycoprotein itself (see Fig. 4 , right panel).",

As shown in Fig. 6 this is indeed the case. Separation of the labeled fragments on polyacrylamide gradient gels revealed that r3H]palmitic acid-and [14C]proline-labeled CNBr peptides of HA2 both migrated to a position corresponding to a molecular weight of about 6000 daltons.

Figure 7 shows the glycoprotein pattern in a 10% polyacrylamide gel of three different strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) which were grown in cultured cells of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chicken (Cursiefen and Becht, 1975; Nagai et al., 1976) . As apparent from the right half of the figure, fatty acids are predominantly bound to the fusion protein (F) in all three strains analyzed. The nonpathogenic NDV-Ulster which contains both some cleaved (F,) and mainly the noncleaved form of the F protein (F,) shows fatty acid binding to both forms of this spike glycoprotein. Only faint labeling of the other protein component of the envelope of NDV, the HN glycoprotein, was detected which may be due to metabolic conversion of some palmitic acid to amino acids or sugars since these low levels of radioactivity in contrast to the bulk radioactivity in the F protein are resistant to treatment with mild alkali in methanol.",

This suggests a possible anchoring function for the protein-bound acyl chains. In addition, acylation could be used as a biochemical regulator to modulate membrane affinity of glycoproteins during their synthesis. Fatty acid attachment could supplement the hydrophobicity of membrane-bound protein segments. This would occur not only by the addition of hydrophobic acyl chains but also by \"masking\" hydrophilic hydroxyl groups of serine residues, shown to be the most probable binding sites for acyl chains (Schmidt and Schlesinger, 1980a; Schmidt, unpublished) . This hypothesis is supported by experiments of Huang et al. (1979) , who found that neuraminidase of influenza virus and neuraminidase-hemagglutinin (HN) of NDV, both free of fatty acid, incorporated very poorly into liposomes when compared with the acylated FPV hemagglutinin or with the F protein of NDV. More direct evidence that fatty acid linkage to proteins increases its membrane affinity stems from a report by Huang et al. (1981) , who modified monoclonal antibodies by chemical acylation. While nontreated IgG could not be incorporated into liposomes, the acylated form was readily incorporated into artificial membranes. To test this hypothesis, experiments are in progress in which viral glycoproteins are deacylated enzymatically in order to com- pare their functional properties with those of the acylated species.",

            "text": "Another possible function of acylation could be a biosynthetic one. Recently Zilberstein et al. (1980) described a VSV mutant which produced almost fully glycosylated G protein at nonpermissive temperature indicating that its transport from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus functions normally. This G protein failed to reach the plasma membrane and was also not acylated. These results were interpreted to indicate that acylation may be essential for intracellular transport of certain glycoproteins from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface. While similar results were also obtained with influenza ts mutants (Schmidt and Klenk, unpublished) , it is still unclear whether in these mutant glycoproteins the lack of acylation alone or additional defects are the reason for the block of intracellular transport. Recently acylation was also detected in membrane proteins of noninfected cells (Schlesinger et al., 1980) . This finding led to the presumption that post-translational modification of polypeptides by covalent linkage of fatty acids may be a general feature of membrane proteins. Current research on the structure and function of acylated viral glycoproteins, which represent excellent model systems, will help to understand the properties of membrane proteins and their interactions with the lipid bilayer.
