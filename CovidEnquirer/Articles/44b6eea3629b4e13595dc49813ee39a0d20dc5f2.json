Here, we identified 137 protein sites that experienced deceleration 10 in their rate of evolution along the HIV-1/SIV phylogeny, likely indicating gain-of-function and 11 consequent adaptation. The majority of such events occurred in parallel to cross-species 12 transmission events and varied between HIV-1 groups, indicating independent adaptation 13 strategies. The evolutionary rate decelerations we found were particularly prominent in 14 accessory proteins that counteract host antiviral restriction factors, suggesting that these factors 15 are a major barrier to viral adaptation to a new host. Surprisingly, we observed that the non-16 pandemic HIV-1 group O, derived from gorillas, exhibited more rate deceleration events than 17 the pandemic group M, derived from chimpanzees. We suggest that the species barrier is higher 18 when the genetic distance of the hosts increases. Our approach paves the way for subsequent 19 studies on cross-species transfers in other major pathogens.",

Due to genetic differences between the hosts, 39 virus adaptation occurs at multiple levels: at the level of entry to target cells; interaction with 40 happened [17] . This is due to new roles gained by these protein sites that constrain their 45 evolution. A reciprocal phenomenon where amino acids are less conserved in one clade than in 46 other clades is also possible, and may either reflect a loss of function or a gain of function 47 manifested as positive diversifying selection. Identification of such \"rate shifting sites\" can thus 48 reveal virus adaptation events, and is expected to promote a better understanding of cross-49 species transmissions in general and in the HIV pandemic in particular in this study. 50",

Here, we utilized the growing availability of diverse and full HIV-1 and SIV 54 genomes to identify many sites in various SIVcpz/SIVgor/HIV-1 clades whose evolutionary rate 55 changed across clades [19] .

In Figure 2 we 87 mapped the percent of rate shifts in each protein observed in each lineage, corresponding to 88 different virus speciation events. While rate deceleration distribution patterns differed between 89 the different lineages (see Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1), one common theme was that 90 all prominent branches underwent a significant portion of their rate deceleration events in the 91 Env protein. The next two common rate decelerating proteins were Gag and Pol identified in all 92 four highlighted branches, which is expected given that together with Env these are the longest 93 proteins in HIV/SIV. When controlling for protein size (as in Table 1 ), a different pattern 94 emerged: Vpu seems to have undergone a disproportionate portion of rate deceleration events, 95 in particular in the branch leading to group M.

These events include adapting to cellular 127 variations such as differences in host receptor CD4; overcoming host innate immune restriction 128 factors such as Tetherin (BST-2) and APOBEC3G; and of course, evasion from the adaptive 129 immune system [16, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .

CD4 is 186 the target receptor of SIV and HIV, while CCR5 or CXCR4 act as co-receptors, recognized by the 187 viral Env protein which is exposed to the virus external surface. Previous studies mapped the 188 genetic diversity between different chimpanzees' CD4 and revealed that there are several 189 differences between chimpanzee subspecies as well as differences between chimpanzee versus 190 gorilla and human, especially in the regions that are in close contact with Env subunit gp120 [50, 191 51 ]. Some of those changes affect the glycosylation patterns of CD4, making these differences 192 even more distinguishable [50, 51] . It is therefore likely that HIV-1 had to adapt to recognize 193 these differences in CD4. 194 Our analysis overall supports a high level of deceleration and acceleration events found 195 in Env, possibly reflecting the changes that occurred in the host CD4. For instance, many of the 196 changes in M-Env occurred in CD4 interacting residues of Env374, Env455, Env456 and Env458 [52] . 197 However, we cannot rule out that the very high rate of evolution in Env, driven by the adaptive 198 immune system [53] , have led to changes that \"mimic\" a rate shift. Indeed when accounting for 199 the size of the Env protein, it seems that this protein is less pronounced in its rate shift 200 distribution (Table 1) . 201 .

To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first large-scale 215 approach to detect adaptation events in the transition from non-human primates to humans, 216 and relies on a robust phylogenetic modeling approach. We discovered many lineage-specific 217 adaptation-like events in many proteins of HIV-1, SIVgor and SIVcpzpts, and have reported sites 218 in where groups M and O suggested to undergone parallel rate shifts.

Accordingly, we suggest that the major common barrier for a host species 222 jump is composed of both the entry stage and the stage where the virus must overcome the first 223 barrier of cellular defenses. Our results further support a differential model of adaptation: 224 groups M and O underwent adaptation in different proteins, and when adaptation occurred at 225 similar sites, the amino-acid was different in both groups. This model is supported by the fact 226 that activity of group M and O proteins are indeed different (e.g., Vpu), and by the fact that each 227 group originated from an SIV from a different primate. 228",

First, the availability of full coverage of SIVcpz 242 and the SIVgor genomes is still low, reducing the statistical power of the analysis. Indeed, we 243 noted that increasing the sample size of group M sequences that are much more available, led 244 to detection of more rate shifting sites (Supplementary File 1) . We expect that the availability of 245 additional SIVgor sequences will increase the number of rate shift events that are unique in that 246 clade, possibly revealing more important sites for this lineage. Second, the method that we 247 utilized to identify rate shifts is calibrated to identify dramatic changes in the evolutionary rate 248 along a lineage. Accordingly, it cannot detect sites where a \"content shift\" occurred, i.e. the 249 amino acid changed and remained conserved in two complementary lineages, since this entails 250 only a minor change in evolutionary rate.

Our 260 results suggest that innate immunity serves as a strong barrier for cross-species transmission 261 events, and that this barrier imposed a strong selective pressure for viruses to adapt as they 262 crossed these barriers with increasing efficiency. 263 .

In order to reconstruct of the phylogenetic 282 relationship between the sequences, we concatenated the alignments of Gag, Pol, Vif, Vpr, Tat  283 and Env and provided this as input for PhyML [60] . We next used the reconstructed phylogeny 284 as a guide tree to realign each protein with PRANK. JpHMM was used to validate that the strains 285 used in the analysis are not inter-group recombinants [61] . 286 .

It . https://doi. org/10.1101/190769 doi: bioRxiv preprint In order to identify evolutionary rate shifts, we used RASER [18] to analyze each of the nine 287 proteins separately, with the proteome-based phylogeny as input. RASER is a likelihood-based 288 phylogenetic method for detecting a change in site-specific evolutionary rates. First, a likelihood 289 ratio test against a null model of no rate shifts is performed in order to assess if a model 290 enabling rate shifts better fits the data. Next, the posterior probability of rate-shift is calculated 291 at each site and sites with a probability higher than 0.6 are considered here as significant. 292",

In addition, 148 in HIV-1 group M the Nef protein was identified with three rate accelerations, supporting the 149 loss of function of its anti-Tetherin activity. This is also supported by a reintroduction 150 experiment of HIV-1 group M strain into chimpanzee in which M-Nef readapted to chimpanzee 151 host, as the mutations required for M-Nef to regain anti-Tetherin activity in chimpanzees (Nef163 152 and Nef169) [39] were located proximally to Nef157, one of the rate accelerating sites of M-Nef 153 identified in our study. Numerous O-Nef rate acceleration events were found as well, supporting 154 the loss of chimpanzee/gorilla anti-Tetherin function. A preponderance of acceleration and 155 deceleration events were also found in the lineages leading to the ancestor of SIVgor and O and 156 to SIVcpzpts; one of those rate deceleration events is at Nef177, which is proximal to the C-loop 157 region which has been shown to be related to O-Nef anti-Tetherin activity[40]. Thus, our 158 analysis pinpoints the sites that are likely responsible for the dramatic changes in function of 159 Vpu and Nef throughout SIVcpz and HIV evolution.

Lentiviruses use their 167 Vif protein to overcome this factor by degrading it as well as other antiviral proteins from the 168 APOBEC3 family (such as A3F, A3D) [43]. A3G variants of human, chimpanzee and gorilla have 169 been studied and the Vif recognition domain has been identified at A3G residues 126-132 [44]. 170Of those species, gorilla has a different residue at A3G position 129 as compared to that of 171 human and chimpanzee A3Gs and indeed the SIVgor adaptation event to the different host A3G 172 has been demonstrated by[45, 46]. It has been shown that SIVgor can replicate in the presence 173 of human-, gorilla-and chimpanzee-A3G, but HIV-1 group M or SIVcpz cannot replicate in the 174 presence of gorilla-A3G, indicative of a gain-of-function in the adaptation process of SIVgor to 175 gorilla[46]. 176",

This led to 2004 sequences of HIV-1 group M, 45 sequences of HIV-1 group O, 9 269 sequences of HIV-1 group N, 2 sequences of HIV-1 group P, 4 sequences of SIVgor and 29 270 sequences of SIVcpz. Two different datasets were constructed: (i) with a very large number of 271 group M sequences compared to the amount of group O sequences, and (ii) with an equal 272 number of group M and group O sequences. Due to computational reasons, dataset (i) included 273 200 HIV-1 sequences, most of them group M. In both datasets, the sequences were sampled so 274 that the n most distant strains (in terms of genetic distance) were sampled. Due to extremely 275 high similarity, HIV-1 groups N and P sequences were reduced to a single representative strain 276 from each. The IIIB_LAI strain was added manually as a reference sequence.

In essence, 64 this tool takes a phylogeny and a multiple sequence alignment and contrasts the rates of 65 evolution of amino acids along all branches in the phylogeny, to determine if the evolutionary 66 rates of some amino acids in some branches are better explained by a model that allows for 67 evolutionary rate changes. We queried the Los Alamos HIV database[19]  for all available HIV-1, 68SIVcpz and SIVgor full sequences, from which we took the sequences of all nine HIV-1 proteins. 69Due to high representation of group M sequences, we downsampled this group to the size of 70 available group O sequences, retaining the strains with the most internal variation (total number 71 of sequences N=126, see Methods). A different downsample of group M sequences to a bigger 72 size was also conducted, to validate results robustness to cohort size variation (N=223, see 73 Methods). All site coordinates are reported based on the HIV-1 subtype B reference strain HXB2 74Most rate shift events were identified in speciation branches. We first sought to characterize 76 the branches where rate shift events were suggested. A total of 271 rate shifting positions were 77 identified along the phylogeny. 137 of them were identified as rate-deceleration events and an 78 additional 134 were identified as rate-accelerations. As listed inTable 1, 230 out of the 271 rate 79 shifting positions were attributed to four branches: the branch separating group M from SIVcpz, 80 the branch separating group O from SIVgor, the branch separating SIVgor and group O from 81 SIVcpz and the branch separating SIVcpzpts from other viruses. Likelihood ratio tests were found 82 to be highly significant in favor of a rate shift model across all HIV proteins (Supplementary 83 Different rate deceleration patterns identified in different branches.
