The acute and persistent stages of PRRSV infection are treated separately. Special attention is given to the author's work on experimental dual infections with PRRSV and other enzootic porcine respiratory viruses. It was concluded that: (1) Studies on the interactions of PRRSV and its target cell, the pulmonary alveolar macrophage, are very scarce. So far, the hypothesis of impaired macrophage function has not been proven. (21 The possibility that PRRSV causes disease in growing pigs in combination with other viral or bacterial infections has been demonstrated experimentally. Variation in disease resulting from such combined PRRSV infections will probably hamper future research into disease mechanisms.

            "text": "During the last several years, pathogenesis and clinical signs of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) have been studied intensively. As a result, the basic pathogenetic features of PRRSV infection are known by now. Infection most frequently occurs by the respiratory route and virus replication in the respiratory tract is followed by viraemia and dissemination throughout the body. The virus has been isolated from nasal turbinates. tonsils, lungs, serum. plasma, buffy coat samples, spleen and several lymph nodes of experimentally infected pigs (Duan et al., 1997; Rossow et al., 1995) . Other tissues including thymus, brain, heart, trachea and bone marrow are more sporadically virus positive. Immunohistochemistry has been used to show that PRRSV infects macrophage-like cells in the lungs, tonsils, lymph nodes. heart, thymus and spleen (Halbur et al., 1995a) . Transplacental infection occurs in late gestation sows, but is beyond the scope of this review. Lymphadenopathy, myocarditis, encephalitis and vasculitis have been reported (Rossow et al., 19951 , but interstitial pneumonia is the most consistent lesion. The lungs are probably the portal of entry as well as the target organ and the virus has a predilection for pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). This paper focuses on the pathogenesis of the respiratory tract infection with PRRSV.",

It has brought about a tremendous interest in this virus from researchers, industry and practitioners. But at this time, scepticism as to the hypothesis of impaired lung defense should be kept for at least 3 reasons. Firstly, only a small fraction of PAMs are infected. At any time PI, no more than about 1% of lavaged alveolar cells are found PRRSV antigen positive (Mengeling et al., 1995; Duan et al., 1997) . But, as suggested by Mengeling et al. (1995) we should take into account that infected AMs may fail to adhere to coverslips or plastic culture plates used in fluorescent antibody tests. As such, the exact number of infected AMs may be quite difficult to score. Secondly, a similar increase in the total number of free bronchoalveolar lavage cells and a proportional reduction of macrophages have been observed with other viral infections of the lungs, such as porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and swine influenzaviruses.",

Marked dyspnoea, abdominal breathing and productive coughing were observed in the high fever group (group I) only, whereas respiratory disease was very mild in the other groups. We calculated that growth retardation in comparison with a single PRRSV inoculated group was 4.6 (group I), 1.8 (group 2) and 1.9 kg (group 31 at 14 DPI of the 2nd virus. Variation thus occurs and so far undefined factors seemingly influence the clinical response following experimental dual virus infections. Important to note is that, next to PRRSV, other porcine respiratory viruses are capable of potentiating the effect of a second viral infection. In the author's group, we have previously performed experimental dual infections of feeder pigs with PRCV first and HlNl-influenzavirus 2 or 3 days later (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994a) . These pigs as well developed higher and longer lasting fever and more pronounced respiratory disease than the respective single virus inoculated pigs.

Individual variations in severity of disease and in growth retardation. however, seriously hamper research into the pathogenesis of such combined infections. The role of PRRSV infection in the respiratory disease complex should not be overestimated for several reasons. First, some researchers have failed to demonstrate a synergism between PRRSV and certain viruses/bacteria under experimental conditions. Second, proof is still lacking to show that combined PRRSV infections are the cause of disease problems in the field. Some cases of nursery mortality associated with PRRSV and bacteria (Stevenson et al., 1993) have been reported, but firm evidence of involvement of multiple PRRSV infections in disease has not yet been given. It should be mentioned that conclusive field studies cannot be based on the results of serology alone. Isolation/demonstration of the agents is necessary as well as information on their association with disease and lesions.",
