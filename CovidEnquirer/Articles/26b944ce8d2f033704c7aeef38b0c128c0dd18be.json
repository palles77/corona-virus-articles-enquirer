In the bag cells, different products of the egg-laying hormone (ELH) precursor are localized to separate classes of DCVs. Peptides from the carboxy-terminal side of the ELH precursor are found in a class of small DCVs which are rapidly transported to the neuronal processes, while peptides from the amino-terminal side of the precursor are found both in a class of large DCVs that are restricted to the cell body and a distinct class of small DCVs which are transported to processes (Fig. 1) . This sorting event has important physiological consequences as the different regions of the ELH prohormone contain peptides with unique biological activities (Kupfermann, 1967; Rothman et al., 1983a,b; Mayeri et al., 1985; Kauer et al., 1987; Brown and Mayeri, 1989) .",

The bag cells have two features that facilitate these studies; (a) the ELH prohormone is the major protein produced by the bag cells and accounts for up to 50% of the translated protein (Berry and Arch, 1981; Scheller et al., 1983) ; (b) an asymmetric distribution of amino acids across the prohormone Fig. 1 ) allows the selective labeling of the sorted carboxy or amino terminal-derived peptides. In this study, we use these properties to selectively follow the flow of neuropeptides derived from the ELH precursor through the secretory pathway. The results suggest possible mechanisms that underlie sorting within the regulated secretory pathway.",

The clusters were then incubated in isoleucine ([3H] Ile) or L-[2, 3, 4, 5, 6-3H]phenylalanine ([3H]-Phe)(Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) (1 mCi/ml for a 30-rain pulse; 4 mCi/mi for a 5-rain pulse) for either 5 or 30 min and then chased with ASW plus 1 mM Phe, ASW plus 1 mM Ile, or isotonic LI5 plus 1 mM Phe for the 12-h chase at 14\u00b0C. The chase was stopped by placing the clusters into a fixation solution consisting of 2 % glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, 1% DMSO, 0.3 M sucrose in PBS (0.137 M NaC1, 25.5 mM KCI, 8 mM Na2PO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4). Occasionally, 1% acrolein was also included in the fixation solution. The tissue was fixed for 4-6 h at room temperature (occasionally overnight at 4\u00b0C). The clusters were rinsed with PBS, desheathed, and osmicated with 2% OsO4 in PBS for 2 h followed by four washes in DDH20 and an additional 2 h in 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate. The clusters were then step-wise dehydrated to 100% ethanol followed by propylene oxide before infiltrating and embedding with Epon-Araldite. After polymerization, thin sections (80-100 nm) were cut on a microtome (Reichert Jung, Vienna, Austria) and collected on formvar-coated nickel grids. The grids were then lead stained, carbon coated, and covered with emulsion L4; Ilford Ltd., Basildon, Essex, England) using the loop technique (Caro and Van Tubergen, 1962; Caro, 1969; Williams, 1977) . The emulsion was exposed in the dark at 4\u00b0C from 2 d to 1 mo depending on the experiment and then developed by incubating in Microdol X (Eastman Kodak Co., R~chester, NY; 3 rain), stopped in 1% acetic acid, fixed with 30% sodium thiosulfate (3 rain), and washed in DvH20.

An important parameter in this program is the approximate error due to the spread of radioactivity, which depends on the thickness of the section and the emulsion. We calculated all time points at half-distance (HD) values (Saltpeter and Bachmann, 1972) of 165, 190, and 230 am. The calculations are fairly insensitive to this parameter, and the data in Table I are calculated with an HD of 190 run, as this value matched our estimates for section and emulsion thickness. The largest variations observed at different HD values occur between the cytoplasm, ER, and small mature vesicles. All of these compartments have large areas and low densities and are situated in close proximity to each other, making it difficult to asign counts between these compartments. The largest change is seen at the Ile 30-rain pulse plus 4-h chase time point, when, with an HD of 230 am, the percentage of counts in small mature vesicles and cytoplasm are 34.3 and 21.3%, respectively, as opposed to 17.6 and 55.4 % with an HD of 165 am. All other changes were minor in comparison, and in the compartments important in these studies-small and large immature vesicles, clear vesicles, and Golgi apparatus-the results between calculations at three HD values differ by no more than 5 % in any experiment.",

Mature and immature DCVs were then divided into small and large classes using a size cutoff (area = 49,000 nm 2, based on a diameter of 250 nm; Fisher et al., 1988) to make a total of 12 compartments. The areas of labeled (center of at least one grain within the vesicle) and unlabeled large vesicles were also calculated to determine if Phe-labeled small immature DCVs gradually increased in size to form large Phe-labeled immature DCVs. At the earliest time point that significant radioactivity is observed in large immature vesicles (Phe 5-rain pulse plus 45rain chase), the average area of labeled large vesicles was actually larger than the average area of unlabeled large vesicles (l.2x) and exceeded the cutoff size by a large margin (average diameter = 490 am). Immature vesicles were defined by either (a) membrane extensions (bulge or sac; see Fig. 2); (b) irregularities in shape; (c) extremely ruffled membranes; or (d) connection to a tubule or Golgi stack. It is important to note that the percentage of immature vesicles is probably an underestimate, as serial sections through bag cells often reveal sacs on vesicles or connections to tubules that are absent in other sections. For the Phe 30-rain pulse plus 12% chase experiment, the iysosome compartment was divided into mottled DCVs and clear lysosomes. For all experiments other than Phe 30-rain pulse plus 12-h chase, the digitization was done blindly without knowledge of the time point or the label used in the experiment.",

            "text": "Most time points include data from more than one application of emulsion. Data was pooled from experiments as long as the average number of grains per micrograph was within 20%. For the Phe 5-min pulse plus 1-h chase experiment, results are a weighted average of two different sets of data. The standard deviations in Table I are the result of simulation experiments (Miller et al., 1985) to evaluate the error inherent in the quantitation. In these experiments, new grains for each micrograph were generated using the assumptions inherent in the algorithm (a poisson distribution of grains in a compartment and a gaussian error vector between the location of the radioactivity and the center of the simulated grain). The maximum likelihood calculation was then repeated for the simulated grains. Five simulations were done for each time point, and the standard deviation of these simulations is presented in Table I . In several cases, the original value was not within one standard deviation of the simulation average, although all values were within two standard deviations. This occurred mainly in the small mature and clear vesicle compartments and is probably caused by the inhomogeneity of these compartments. For example, the clear vesicle compartment contains transport vesicles from ER to Goigi apparatus, from one Golgi slack to another, and from Golgi apparatus to plasma membrane as well as parts of the TGN, primary lysosomes, and other compartments that cannot be differentiated by morphology. The simulation treats these as homogeneous compartments, while the grains may have been coming from a small subset of these compartments. Therefore, the simulations arrive at estimates different from the original computation. The small mature vesicles at early time points are usually found close to the Golgi apparatus and thus do not share the distribution of the majority of small mature vesicles, again causing differences between the simulation and the original experiment. Other errors, such as sampling bias and digitation errors, are not included in the standard deviations and probably add to the total error in the experiment. It is difficult to quantitate these errors and they are presumed to be minor contributions compared with the errors due to the quantitation procedure.",

In contrast to other systems, initial cleavage of the ELH prohormone still occurs after a monensin block; however, all subsequent cleavages are inhibited, and the two initial processing intermediates accumulate in monensin-treated cells (Fig. 2 C) (Yates and Berry, 1984) .

Immature vesicles have also been shown to contain acid phosphatase in a number of other systems (Smith and Farquhar, 1966; Novikoff et al., 1971; Hand and Oliver, 1977) . Fig. 6 , A-C, shows a series of micrographs from a set of serial sections; the structure marked by the small arrow actually attaches to the proximal large immature vesicle (Fig. 6 A) and in the next section attaches to a small immature vesicle (Fig. 6 B) . Many other attachments between acid phosphatase-containing vesicles are seen in serial sections, suggesting that the immature vesicles are to some extent still connected to the tubular portion of the TGN.

The large DCVs are not transported to the processes (Kreiner et al., 1986) and quantitative immunoelectron microscopy Studies suggest that the different levels of peptides could be due to the selective degradation or release of these large vesicles . To examine this question we chased [3H]Phe-labeled bag cell clusters for longer times to observe the eventual fate of the large DCVs. After 12 h of chase, many grains are observed in vesicles with heterogeneous cores that we refer to as mottled DCVs (Table I) . The appearance of the core is quite variable, ranging from vesicles that are mostly clear but contained patches of dense material (Fig.7 A) to dense DCVs with nonhomogeneous patches (Fig.  7 B) . Loss of the homogeneous dense core suggests the peptides are being degraded. Few grains are observed over large membranous lysosomes or multivesicular bodies. Other interesting results from this time point include the movement of grains from immature to mature large vesicles and an increase in the number of grains in small mature vesicles (Table I). Coupled with the lack of constitutive release of large vesicle contents (Fisher, J., unpublished data) , these results suggest that the asymmetry in peptide steady-state levels is generated through a degradative pathway.",

Correlating a biochemical assay of processing with EM autoradiography predicts cleavage of the ELH prohormone in a late Golgi compartment. Further support for this model comes from subcellular fractionation studies of bag cells, where the initial cleavage is shown to occur in a light fraction enriched in mannosidase II activity (a Golgi marker) and well separated from the DCVs (Sweet, A., J. M. Fisher, W. S. Sossin, R. Newcomb, and R. H. Scheller, manuscript submitted for publication). The initial cleavage is not blocked by monensin, which does block the formation of mature granules. The protease that cleaves the tetrabasic site may be a TGN resident protein whose activity triggers the condensation and sorting of the processing intermediates in this compartment. Alternatively, processing enzymes with different pH activation profiles or different affinities for the various cleavage sites may explain the distinct subcellular sites of endoproteolytic cleavage in the bag cells. Multiple enzymes with different pH profiles have been proposed to differentiate between the two cleavages of the insulin precursor (Davidson et al., 1988) .",

A solid line represents the carboxyterminal intermediate; a dotted line represents the amino-terminal intermediate; a dotted line attached to a solid line represents the ELH prohormone; smaller lines represent the carboxy-terminal final product peptides; and dots represent the amino-terminal final product peptides. L indicates an organelle of degradative function (endosome or lysosome). Direct connection between the part of the TGN containing large immature vesicles and small immature vesicles is putative and this is represented by a dotted line. Shading represents acid phosphatase-positive membranes. The small amino-and carboxy-terminal vesicles will be transported to processes for regulated release, where they are present at a carboxy-toamino terminal ratio of 5:1 . ture vesicles and clear vesicles. Although the compartment of clear vesicles is obviously heterogeneous, the location and the time course of counts moving into these vesicles is most consistent with their arising from sections through the TGN. The lack of grains located over clear vesicles in other EM autoradiographic studies of neuropeptide transport (Saltpeter and Farquhar, 1981) may be due to an earlier peptide condensation event in that system. Amino terminal-associated radioactivity then decreases in clear vesicles and small immature granules and increases in large immature granules. It is the selective movement of the amino-terminal intermediate to large immature granules and/or the selective retention of the carboxy-terminal intermediate in small immature granules that underlies sorting within the regulated pathway. These results suggest a flow of the amino-terminal intermediate through the TGN from an early region that conrains small immature vesicles to a later region that contains large immature vesicles.",

We propose that the small amino terminal-containing vesicles that are transported to processes arise from the larger immature vesicles, although the evidence supporting this idea is not yet conclusive. In support of this idea, a higher proportion of processing intermediate immunoreactivity is found in the large vesicles (Kreiner et al., 1989) . Furthermore, in [3H]Phelabeled experiments, a high concentration of autoradiographic grains is seen in mature small DCVs only after a 12-h chase but not at earlier time points (Table I) .

One appealing possibility is that the carboxyterminal intermediate selectively condenses in the early region of the TGN, leaving the amino-terminal intermediate soluble. Perhaps different ionic conditions or different accessory proteins (Chung et al., 1989) located in the late region of the TGN would allow the amino-terminal portion of the prohormone to condense at this site. A differential timing of condensation has also been proposed to explain the separation of prolactin and growth hormone in somatomammotrophs (Fumagilli and Zanini, 1985) . The aggregated carboxy-terminal portion of the precursor may be prevented from traveling to the late compartment either through steric hindrance of aggregates moving through small tubules, the inability to be packaged into small transport vesicles, or a specific association with an immobile membrane-bound receptor. Alternatively, movement of the amino-terminal portion of the precursor may be mediated through the actions of a membrane-bound recognition system. In support of this model, the bag cell amino-terminal intermediate (F2) is associated with membranes at a time point (30-min pulse and 2-h chase) when the carboxy-terminal intermediate (I3) is not membrane associated (Fisher, J., manuscript in preparation; illustrated in Fig. 8) . A selective association of the amino-terminal intermediate with a membrane-bound receptor would allow a vesicular sorting mechanism similar to that proposed for lysosomal enzymes.",

The carboxy-terminal ELH acts both on nearby neurons (Mayeri et al., 1985) and through the circulation at peripheral targets as a hormonal substance (Kupfermann, 1967; R~thman et al., 1983b). Thus, while the polyprotein motif ensures cosynthesis, the relative levels of these two sets of substances are regulated by the proteolytic cleavage, packaging, and targeting described above.
