            "text": "The diagnosis of pregnancy in the domestic dog (Canis familiaris) often employs specialized equipment, experienced staff, and the cooperation of the bitch. These procedures can be challenging when the subject is a wild canid, particularly in a field setting. In addition, reproductive hormone assays are unreliable as a diagnostic tool because the estrous profiles of pregnant and pseudopregnant canines are similar. However, research has demonstrated that the hormone relaxin can be detected in maternal blood after embryonic implantation, but remains negligible in non-pregnant females. We investigated the use of relaxin as a diagnostic marker of pregnancy in the coyote (C. latrans). A commercially available canine relaxin enzyme immunoassay (ReproCHEK TM ) was used to test plasma collected from 124 female coyotes over four consecutive breeding seasons. Mating activities of the captive females were observed; then peripheral blood samples were collected at intervals throughout pregnancy, as well as after parturition. Results demonstrated that relaxin could be detected in the plasma of pregnant coyotes after 28 days of gestation, and in some cases as early as 23 days, while non-pregnant females and male coyotes consistently tested negative. Relaxin also remained detectable in the plasma of the majority of females tested 10-12 weeks after parturition. This qualitative assay for relaxin proved to be a reliable diagnostic tool for pregnancy in the coyote. In addition, blood sampling was relatively easy, could be accomplished with minimal handling, and did not require sedation or anesthesia.",

Coyotes are considered seasonally monestrous (Hamlett, 1938; Gier, 1968 ) and socially monogamous (Andelt, 1985; Bekoff and Wells, 1986; Gese, 2001) . While there is some regional variation in the actual breeding season, coyotes generally mate in mid-to late-winter, have a gestation period of 60-63 days, and deliver an average litter of three to seven pups in the spring (Hamlett, 1938; Gier, 1968; Knowlton, 1972; Gese et al., 1989) . Typically, only the dominant male and female within a coyote social group produce a litter (Gese et al., 1989 (Gese et al., , 1996 , although subordinate associates will help defend the pups and territory (Andelt, 1985; Bekoff and Wells, 1986; Gese, 2001) .",

Like the wolf and dog, differentiating a pregnant coyote from a non-pregnant female can be difficult if based on serological assessment alone. Pregnant and pseudopregnant coyotes have similar patterns of serum progesterone secretion, and the absolute concentration levels vary widely among individuals (Carlson, 2006) . Also, while mid-gestation prolactin levels in coyotes rise significantly above those observed in nongravid diestrous females, the absolute values still overlap (Carlson, 2006) . Thus, single blood sampling for progesterone or prolactin seems unreliable as a method of determining reproductive status in coyotes. The hormone relaxin, however, has not yet been explored in this species.",

The source of relaxin synthesis varies among species, but the predominant sites are the corpus luteum, placenta, and uterus (Sherwood, 1994) . Depending on the species, detection of relaxin in peripheral blood is not always restricted to pregnant females; however in the domestic dog it has been established as a pregnancy-specific hormone (Steinetz et al., 1987 (Steinetz et al., , 1989 . The site of synthesis in the bitch has been elucidated (Tsutsui and Stewart, 1991; Klonisch et al., 1999) and primarily ascribed to the placenta, although the hormone can also be traced in the ovary and uterus.

A clinical study of domestic dogs using the commercially available canine relaxin enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) ReproCHEK TM (Synbiotics Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA) reported detection of the hormone in maternal peripheral blood as early as 25 days after ovulation (Buff et al., 2001) .",

The coyotes were captive born and reared at the National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) facility near Millville, UT, USA. All animals were housed in outdoor enclosures with natural lighting. Male-female pairs resided in 0.1 ha outdoor pens with access to den boxes sheltered within observation buildings. Multiple pens were within visual and audible range of each other but separated by fencing and concrete barriers. Some individual animals were sequestered from their mates during the breeding season and served as unmated controls. In these cases, the females were housed in sheltered outdoor kennels which also included den boxes for privacy.",

A gestation length of 62 days was assumed (Gier, 1968; Kennelly, 1978) and the OD readings were aligned using the day of parturition as the reference point. Partitioning of the gestation period into weekly intervals showed optical density increasing by week 4 (Table 3) . When more than one sample was collected, it was possible to estimate the day of gestation based upon when a coyote first showed a positive relaxin test result (Table 4) . Under these conditions, the earliest positive result was obtained at an estimated 23 days gestation; on days 24-27 results either were negative, indeterminate, or positive. However, from day 28 on, all results were positive and had an OD \u2265 0.100 (Fig. 1) . We also note that while some negative and indeterminate results were recorded, at least 90% of the samples collected on days 25-27 were interpreted as positive (Table 4 ). An indeterminate threshold range of 0.030-0.050 OD was established based upon the absorbance values of the internal coyote controls and those of the manufacturer's reagents; and reinforced by the absorbance measurements recorded for the mated females with and without pups. All internal (coyote) controls were \u22640.032, and the difference between the maximum ReproCHEK TM negative control (0.037) and the minimum ReproCHEK TM positive control (0.051) was in the range of 0.038-0.050 (Table 2) . Samples (n = 69) from the 26 mated females without pups fell in the range of \u22120.005 to 0.072 (median 0.009 OD). The singular female with the OD measurement of 0.072 retested 2 weeks later at 0.033; and while 5 other samples in this group were also between 0.030-0.050, 62 samples (90%) were <0.030. Days are aligned from day of parturition and assume a common 62-day gestation for all females. % Pos: percentage of samples (n) testing positive per day. a Earliest day of gestation when a positive sample was observed. b All samples from day 28 forward tested positive. Serial blood sampling from five subjects revealed that within 48-72 h a pregnant female coyote could display a rapid increase in OD measurements representing a plasma-conversion from negative to positive. For example, one female changed from 0.015 to 0.117 in 2 days, while another from 0.012 to 0.160 in 3 days. This latter data suggested that the absorbance readings of females who were pregnant (true-positives) would quickly increase in intensity (Fig. 1) , thus differentiating them from non-pregnant cohorts within a short period of time. However, the timing of a sample collection might produce an indeterminate result (0.030-0.050 OD), and such results need to be rechecked.",

For technical reasons the manufacturer makes no attempt to correlate color intensity or absorbance with circulating levels of relaxin, and this study did not provide any evidence that these measurements could predict either reproductive success or litter size. Follow up testing of the two females who experienced spontaneous abortions (neither the etiology nor the day of fetal death is known) produced very different results. Both females were positive 3 or 5 days before the fetuses were expelled; but while the first female tested negative 4 and 10 days after, the second female remained positive up to 34 days later.",

Color development of unknown samples can be compared to the ReproCHEK TM negative control (per the manufacturer's instructions), but our experience suggests that in coyotes a weak-positive result should be interpreted carefully. We recommend that sampling not begin until 4 weeks (28 days) after the most active mating behavior is observed, and that initial negative results be confirmed with a new specimen 1-2 weeks later. With these considerations in mind, this assay should be a reliable tool in this species and possibly other wild congeners of Canis.",

Post-partum sampling continued after the 2000-2002 breeding seasons with 44 females (n = 114) spanning 140 days, although sampling was suspended between days 28 and 60. Data were aligned by day of parturition (indicated by the vertical dashed line) and assumed a full term gestation of 62 days. During this study, the optical density measurements for non-pregnant females consistently remained below the 0.100 OD threshold as indicated by the horizontal dashed line.
