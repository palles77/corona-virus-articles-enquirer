We noted gene transfer efficiencies similar to that observed for human airway epithelia (HAE). Interestingly, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-based vectors transduced immortalized pig cells as well as pig primary cells more efficiently than HIV-1-based vectors. PAE express TRIM5 , a well-characterized species-specific lentiviral restriction factor. We contrasted the restrictive properties of porcine TRIM5 against FIV-and HIV-based vectors using gain and loss of function approaches. We observed no effect on HIV-1 or FIV conferred transgene expression in response to porcine TRIM5 overexpression or knockdown. To evaluate the ability of GP64-FIV to transduce porcine airways in vivo, we delivered vector expressing mCherry to the tracheal lobe of the lung and the ethmoid sinus of 4-week-old pigs. One week later, epithelial cells expressing mCherry were readily detected. Our findings indicate that pseudotyped FIV vectors confer similar tropisms in porcine epithelia as observed in human HAE and provide further support for the selection of GP64 as an appropriate envelope pseudotype for future preclinical gene therapy studies in the porcine model of cystic fibrosis (CF).",

The recent development of alternative CF animal models 8-10 provides a new resource for preclinical therapeutic studies. Importantly, the CF pig exhibits many similarities to CF in humans including multiorgan system involvement (sinus, lung, pancreas, intestine, liver) and the presence of an airway mucosal host defense defect at birth. 9, 11 The cell types comprising the conducting airway epithelium in pigs and humans are similar, and notably lack the ~50% bronchiolar exocrine cells typical of mice. The pig bronchial epithelium is pseudostratified and contains ciliated, basal, and goblet cells, and abundant submucosal glands (reviewed in ref. 12) . Importantly, the distribution of submucosal glands in the conducting airways and the CFTR-dependent and -independent secretion of liquid and macromolecules is similar to human submucosal glands. [13] [14] [15] [16] Thus, pig airway cell composition is much more akin to human airways than are those of mice.",

Porcine cells are not widely used for lentiviral gene transfer studies and little effort has been put forth optimizing or comparing viral vector transduction efficacy in this animal model. We generated matched vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG)-pseudotyped FIV and HIV-based vectors expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (Figure 1a ). In addition, these self-inactivating vectors contain the wPRE and cPPT elements. 22 Murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) are subtyped as N-tropic (N-MLV) or B-tropic (B-MLV) according to their infectivity in certain strains of mice. Importantly, N-MLV infection is consistently restricted by Trim5 from mammalian species whereas B-MLV is resistant to the Trim5 restriction. 18, 23 As such, N-MLV and B-MLV vectors expressing GFP serve as controls for Trim5 restriction. We transduced human cervical (HeLa), bovine kidney (MDBK), and porcine kidney epithelia cells (PK1) with FIV, HIV, N-MLV, and B-MLV at multiplicity of infection (MOIs) ranging from 0.5 to 5 (Figure 1b) . FIV-and HIV-based vectors transduced HeLa cells with similar efficacy and, consistent with previous observations, 18 both had restricted expression in MDBK cells. Interestingly, FIV transduced PK1 cells approximately tenfold better than HIV across all MOIs tested. No restriction of FIV was apparent in PK1 cells compared with B-MLV, which typically displayed higher levels of transduction in most cell types tested, including airway cell lines (data not shown) and HeLa cells (Figure 1b) . We next contrasted the lentiviral transduction patterns in well-differentiated primary cultures of porcine airway epithelia (PAE). PAEs derived from wild-type pig trachea were transduced with N-MLV, B-MLV, FIV, or HIV-1 at MOIs of 5 or 20 (Figure 1b) . Consistent with PK1 cells, we observed greater transduction efficacy of FIV as compared with HIV. We next compared the transduction efficiency of FIV and HIV in four different immortalized cell lines derived from human lung epithelia. While higher level of transduction was seen with FIV compared to HIV in H441 cells, similar transduction efficiencies with FIV or HIV were observed in the rest of the cell lines (Figure 1c) . Transduction pattern differences of FIV and HIV-1 in porcine cells, but not in human-derived cells, suggests the existence of species-specific restriction factors against HIV-1 in porcine cells. A porcine TRIM5 ortholog was identified from sequence homology and predicted protein domain similarity to known TRIM proteins. 18 A previous study reported that HIV-1 infection is restricted in cell lines originated from pigs, 24 but there has been little focus on porcine TRIM5. Bovine TRIM5 was previously demonstrated to have broad restrictive properties against many lentiviruses including HIV-1 and FIV. 18, 19, 24 We hypothesized that porcine TRIM5 could restrict both FIV and HIV vectors because of its close phylogenetic similarity to bovine TRIM5. Using porcine-specific primers, porcine TRIM5 mRNA was successfully amplified from PK1 and PAE cells (Figure 2a) . A hemaglutinin (HA)-tagged porcine TRIM5 was transiently transfected into HT1080 cell lines and expression was confirmed by western blot (Figure 2b ). Cells transfected with empty plasmid or porcine TRIM5 were transduced with N-MLV, B-MLV, FIV, or HIV-1 at MOIs of 5. B-MLV transduction was not restricted in the presence of porcine TRIM5, as expected (Figure 2c ). While restriction of N-MLV was observed in porcine TRIM5-expressing cells, no restriction was observed for FIV or HIV transduction.",

This chimera contains the residues responsible for capsid specificity. 26 MDTF cells expressing no TRIM5 serve as the baseline. All TRIM5 proteins were HA-tagged and cell lines confirmed by immunoblotting to express equivalent protein levels (Figure 2f ). Cells were transduced with GFP expressing N-MLV, B-MLV, or FIV pseudotyped with VSVG. As expected, no significant restriction of B-MLV was observed; however, N-MLV virus was restricted by TRIM5 expressed from each of the tested MDTF cell lines (Figure 2g ). Following transduction with FIV, restriction was seen in cells expressing TRIM5 from both nonhuman primate species tested (Figure 2g ). Human TRIM5 did not restrict FIV; whereas, TRIM5 hu(rh325-344) restricted expression to levels similar to TRIM5 rh .

When FIV was pseudotyped with the S-protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, the expression steadily declined in both HAE and PAE.

We evaluated the HA and neuraminidase from either the 1918 H1N1 influenza strain or a common H3N2 strain of swine influenza (A/SwMN593/99).

One week post-transduction, the efficacy of gene transfer was examined visually by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4a-c) or quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). FACS analysis demonstrated that 10 \u00b1 6.5% were mCherry positive (n = 3 donors, one culture/donor). By counterstaining for -tubulin, a marker for cilia, we determined that at 1 week post-transduction, both ciliated and nonciliated surface epithelial cells were transduced (Figure 4c) . This pattern of transduction is consistent with previous observations in mouse nasal epithelia (P.L. Sinn, M. Oakland, unpublished data). To confirm that FIV pseudotyped with GP64 or VSVG has similar apical or basolateral transduction preference in PAE as previously observed in HAE, vector expressing -galactosidase was applied to the apical or basolateral surface of the epithelial sheet for 4 hours (MOI = 30). Four days following vector delivery, gene transfer was quantified by measuring -galactosidase activity. As shown (Figure 4d) , we replicate previous observations that GP64-FIV preferentially transduces HAE at the apical surface and VSVG-FIV preferentially transduces HAE at the basolateral surface. 30 Furthermore, at the same MOI, -galactosidase activity following apical application of GP64-FIV was greater than that achieved with basolateral VSVG-FIV vector application. Using GP64-FIV expressing a firefly luciferase reporter gene and longitudinal bioluminescent imaging, persistent gene expression was observed for 7 weeks in PAE with no significant decline (Figure 4e) . We next measured GP64-FIV-mediated transduction efficiency in porcine nasal and tracheal epithelia. We cultured primary cells derived from nasal septa and trachea of wildtype newborn pigs. GP64-FIV expressing firefly luciferase was applied apically for 24 hours (MOI = 5) and luciferase activity assays were performed a week later. GP64-FIV transduced porcine nasal epithelia with equal efficacy as tracheal epithelia (Figure 4f) . Interestingly, in mouse-derived PAE cells, GP64-FIV transduces septal-derived cells with greater efficacy than tracheal-derived cells (P.L. Sinn, M. Oakland, P.B. McCray, unpublished observations). A VSV-based vector pseudotyped with GP64 was also used to transduce both porcine nasal and tracheal epithelial cells. In PAE cells, we observed a trend of improved GP64-VSV transduction in tracheal-derived epithelial cells (Figure 4f) . Both septa-and tracheal-derived cultures were imaged using scanning electron microscopy. Electron microscopy confirmed that cultures were well differentiated, and similar apical surface morphology was observed for cultures from both anatomical regions (Figure 4g-j) .",

            "text": "To evaluate the ability of GP64-FIV to transduce porcine pulmonary airways in vivo, we delivered GP64-FIV expressing mCherry vector to the tracheal lobe of 4-week-old pigs. The animals were sedated and a Pentax FB-10X bronchoscope (outer diameter 3.5 mm) was introduced orotracheally. The bronchoscope was passed into the tracheal lobe via the tracheal bronchus and, for the initial lung delivery strategy, a PE20 catheter (Figure 5a ) was passed distally under direct visualization until it wedged. Two milliliter of GP64-FIV mCherry vector (5 \u00d7 10 8 TU) was delivered in a solution of 1% methylcellulose. One week later, animals were euthanized and the tracheal lobe was fixed, frozen, and sectioned. Alternate sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to visualize cellular morphology (Figure 5b,f) . As shown, cells expressing mCherry were readily detected (Figure 5c,d) . No mCherry expression was observed in the left lower lobe of the same animals (data not shown). We observed that a bolus delivery of vector through a polyethylene catheter resulted in mCherry expression that was mainly restricted to the distal airways and alveoli. We next contrasted polyethylene catheter-mediated vector delivery to vector delivery using a drug infusion balloon catheter designed for treating pulmonary thrombi (Figure 5e) . As before, a bronchoscope guided the catheter to the tracheal lobe and 1 ml of GP64-FIV mCherry vector (5 \u00d7 10 8 TU) was delivered. The balloon remained inflated for ~3 minutes while vector was applied directly to the conducting airway. As shown, isolated regions of abundant mCherry expression were observed in conducting airway epithelial cells of the tracheal lobe (Figure 5g,h) . As before, no mCherry expression was observed in the left lower lobe of the same animals (data not shown). Gene transfer to sinuses is relevant because CF pigs develop spontaneous sinusitis similar to humans and sinuses may be a site of initial bacterial infection and seeding of the lungs. 32 We determined whether the FIV-mediated mCherry expression in the transduced epithelial cells in vivo persisted after the cells were isolated and allowed to differentiate at an air-liquid interface in vitro. For initial pilot experiments, we delivered vector to the nasal epithelia of mice. After septa from mice were collected and the epithelial cells were cultured, mCherry expression was readily observed (Figure 6a) . The epithelial cells were allowed to fully differentiate at an air-liquid interface for 4 weeks before lysates were collected for FACS analysis. Based on FACS analysis, 5.5 \u00b1 0.3% of culture mouse septa were mCherry positive. Encouraged by these results, we repeated the process in the pig ethmoid sinus. As before, the epithelial cells were allowed to fully differentiate at an air-liquid interface for 4 weeks. Again, mCherry expression was readily observed in cultured left ethmoid sinus epithelia (Figure 6b) but not the contralateral untransduced ethmoid sinus (Figure 6c) . By visual count, we determined that 4.5 \u00b1 0.9% of surface cells derived from the left ethmoid sinus were mCherry positive. This technique may provide a strategy to confirm in vivo CFTR gene transfer efficacy in future experiments.",

A goal of these studies was to examine the porcine respiratory tract tropism of lentiviral vector pseudotypes with known preference for transducing the apical surface of airway epithelia. We and others reported successful lentiviral pseudotyping with glycoproteins from diverse viral families such as filovirus, 29 coronavirus, 33 orthomyxovirus, 30 retrovirus, 27,28 and baculovirus. 30, 31 However, the most effective envelope glycoprotein candidate for lentiviral-mediated pulmonary gene transfer we have identified to date is GP64. In mice, GP64-FIV conferred persistent gene transfer in vivo, consistent with progenitor cell transduction. 31, 34 We compared FIV-and HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors for their ability to transduce pig airway epithelia cells in vitro. We reproducibly observed better transduction for FIV than HIV-1 in both immortalized PK1 cells and primary cultures of PAE cells. This unexpected finding led us to investigate the transduction efficiency of FIV and HIV-1 vectors in multiple human airway cell lines. We conclude that the two lentiviruses have similar transduction patterns in human cells, displaying no significant differences in efficiency. However, both lentiviral vectors were less efficient than control B-MLV in porcine cells, suggesting that some restriction is present. Whether the observed restriction is viral vector or host cell-specific has not yet been determined. A possible explanation is that another host cell restriction factor identifies incoming lentiviral but not oncoretroviral capsid proteins.",

There is some debate as to where fusion occurs with wild-type SARS-coronavirus. Initially, it was thought to enter cells through direct fusion with the plasma membrane; 40 however, more recent evidence suggests that virus entry may also involve pH-dependent endocytosis. 41 Of the envelope glycoproteins listed, only FIV pseudotyped with VSVG and GP64 have been demonstrated to transduce cells via a low-pH endosome route. 30 The observation that not all envelope glycoproteins resulted in persistent expression in primary cells was unexpected. The mechanism for this result is currently unknown but may be dependent upon the cell types transduced and the entry or endocytosis pathway directed by interactions between envelope glycoproteins and their receptors.",

Hetero-multimers of TRIM family members can occur. 43, 44 It is possible that interaction between endogenous proteins alters the function of expressed exogenous TRIM5 either positively or negatively.

There may be enough conservation in the human TRIM5 coiled-coil region to allow multimerization with other species variants resulting in dominant negative activity, which could render the protein inactive.

Primers and a probe used to detect porcine GAPDH are as follows: The upstream primer (5 GGCATGGCCTTCCGTGT 3 ), the downstream primer (5 GCCCAGGATGCCCTTGAG 3 ), and the probe (5 56FAM-CCTGCTTCA-ZEN-CCACCTTCTTGATG TCATCAT-3IABkFQ 3 ). The duplex that yielded the greatest knockdown (TRIM5po S 5 CCACUAAUUUCGUCAGGGAAACA TT 3 , and TRIM5po AS 5 AAUGUUUCCCmUGmACGAAAUU mAGmUGmGmGmU 3 ) was used for subsequent knockdown experiments.",

After 18 hours of incubation, cells were transiently transfected with empty plasmid or pCAGGs-pig TRIM5 using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (11668; Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after the seeding of MDTF cells or 48 hours after the seeding of HT1080 cells, cells were transduced with appropriate MOI or MOI predetermined for achieving ~30-40% GFP-positive cells by fluorescence cell sorting (FACScan; Becton-Dickinson, San Diego, CA) on TRIM5 null control cells. Viruses tested included N-MLV, B-MLV, and FIV, all expressing GFP. All transductions were carried out for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C with 5 \u03bcg/ml polybrene (107689; Sigma). Two days post-transduction, the percentage of GFPpositive cells was determined by flow cytometry.",
