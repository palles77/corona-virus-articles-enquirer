            "text": "A s The Year of the Lung (YOL) comes to a close, it is appropriate to take stock of what we hoped to accomplish. For the person on the street, both entering and leaving the world seems to be a function of the lung by the \"fi rst\" or the \"last\" breath. However, this beautiful pair of vital organs has not had its due credit in the public or the research arena. The grim statistics are well known: 9 million new cases of TB are reported each year, resulting in nearly 2 million deaths 1 ; pneumonia accounts for the deaths of 1.8 million, 2 and estimates indicate that 1 in every 250 deaths worldwide can be attributed to asthma, many of which could have been prevented with proper treatment. 3 Tobacco is a \"marketed malady\" with 5 million deaths worldwide due to tobacco-related diseases. 4 Lung cancer accounts for 1.3 million deaths worldwide. 5 COPD is increasing and will soon become the third cause of death worldwide. 6 Each year, infl uenza kills thousands. Although the world's attention toward the lungs peaks during epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 2009 infl uenza A(H1N1) infection, lung health generally has not been on the public or governmental radar screen. Pink ribbons support awareness for breast cancer, but few realize that in the United States lung cancer kills more than colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. Despite these ominous statistics, in a recent New York Times health-care column featuring disease risk in different organs, the lungs were conspicuously missing. 7",

This should draw the attention of global bodies such as the World Economic Forum, whose pronouncements beget health-care policies, public health programs, and research dollars. Although other diseases, such as diabetes and coronary artery disease, have captured world attention, the diseases of the lung have not shared a similar status in the public eye. In the United States alone, lung disease costs $ 15 billion annually.",

Public statements were issued on designated days to focus on lung diseases and raise awareness, such as Lung Cancer Day and COPD Day. For the fi rst time, a World Spirometry Day was organized on October 14th 2010. Spirometry, the simple monitoring tool of lung function, is not used with regularity even in developed countries and is not readily available to those in the developing world. The journals of the FIRS organizations have carried articles highlighting the YOL, a signature campaign for the declaration has been an ongoing project at all the meetings, and legislators have been educated on the problem in the United States and many other countries. Each organization has planned and executed many projects to celebrate the YOL. A Web site ( http :// www . 2010yearofthelung . org ) created to specifi cally communicate about this initiative has received nearly a half million interested visitors. The logo symbolizing the FIRS partnership, diversity and global involvement, is now a well-recognized symbol of lung health.",

The annual CHEST meeting in Vancouver, BC, Canada, hosted many sessions that highlighted the YOL. ACCP has many resources, such as lung cancer and thromboembolism guidelines, disseminated worldwide.

This integrated effort should translate into more research dollars, governmental programs, and supportive policy decisions.
