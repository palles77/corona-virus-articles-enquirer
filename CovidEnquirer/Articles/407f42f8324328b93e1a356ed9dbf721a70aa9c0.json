Two calves were killed when clinical signs were most severe and bacteria were seen attached to the surfaces of enterocytes in the large intestine; microscopic lesions were seen in these areas. The lesions were identical to those previously reported in a natural outbreak of dysentery in calves, from which E. coli $102-9 was isolated, and to those seen in gnotobiotic calves experimentally infected with S102-9. Reinfection of the three surviving calves 16--20 days later with S102-9 and primary infection of two calves aged 24 and 51 days did not cause dysentery. Four of 659 coliforms isolated from field outbreaks of calf diarrhoea resembled the atypical strain S102-9. These four isolates and $102-9 did not produce heat-stable enterotoxin, but all produced a toxin cytopathic for Veto and HeLa cells. Two of the four isolates were inoculated alone into 4-day-old gnotobiotic calves deprived of colostrum ; neither calf developed dysentery but microscopic lesions identical to those produced by S102-9 were detected in the large intestines of both animals.",

The distinctive characteristics of $102-9 included an atypical colony morphology on MacConkey agar, production of urease and anaerogenicity, but it was identified as E. coli in particular by its abilities to produce acid in MacConkey broth at 44\u00b0C and indole at 44\u00b0C. $102-9 was shown by an immunoperoxidase method to adhere to the mucosae of the large bowel in gnotobiotic and farm calves with dysentery, and microscopic lesions were seen in the colonic and rectal mucosae (Hall et al., 1985) . These were identical to those seen in piglets (Moon et al., 1983) , man (Rothbaum et al., 1982) and rabbits (Takeuchi et al., 1978) infected with E. coli which do not produce the classical enterotoxins and which are not invasive. The objectives of the experiments reported here were firstly to establish the pathogenicity of E. coli S102-9 for conventional calves, secondly, to determine whether E. coli with atypical characteristics were an important cause of calf diarrhoea by examining a culture collection of 659 isolates from field outbreaks of diarrhoea, and thirdly, to investigate by experimental infection of gnotobiotic calves, the association between the atypical characteristics of these isolates and pathogenicity. Electron microscopy was used to examine more precisely lesions produced by atypical E. coli and to compare them with those described previously.",

This Absorption of antibody to S102-9 a Fimbriae (F) or haemagglutinins (H) produced on suggested that isolate 6/193 was avirulent. Calves excreted between 1.2 X 109 and 2.2 X 10 l\u00b0 E. coli g-1 of faeces until they were killed. Three days after infection, faeces of the gnotobiotic calf infected with E. coli 37/1 inoculated onto MacConkey agar revealed E. coli with two different colony morphologies in approximately equal numbers. One was atypical and of the kind produced by E. coli $102-9, and the other was typical of most isolates of E. coli. E. coli of both types, however, were anaerogenic, produced urease and agglutinated in antiserum to E. coli S102-9.

However, one (6/193) did not cause disease and the other (37/1) caused mucoid diarrhoea. Failure of these strains to cause dysentery may have been related to the extent of bacterial colonisation and the lesions caused. There were approximately 10-fold fewer E. coli 37/1 or 6/193 in the mucosae of the large intestine than were previously reported for E. coli $102-9 in gnotobiotic calves . The extent of microscopic lesions in the gnotobiotic calves was difficult to assess, particularly because of their focal nature, which was apparently similar to that seen in calves infected with E. coli S102-9. Consequently, the virulence of these E. coli may vary not only with the ability to colonise but also the extent of the lesions they cause or, alternatively, it may differ with the production of an unknown pathogenic determinant. In man infected with different strains of verotoxic E. coli, which cause the same type of lesion, signs of disease vary from mild diarrhoea to dysentery (Anon, 1983 ).",

Some of these strains and others virulent for a number of species have been shown to cause highly characteristic microscopic lesions of the gut mucosa and to produce a cytotoxin detectable in vitro and have been called EPEC (Anon, 1983) . The microscopic lesions and production of cytotoxin may be unifying features of an emerging sub-group of enteropathogenic E. coli for which the term EPEC is not sufficiently descriptive. Takeuchi et al. (1978) suggested that these lesions in rabbits were induced by a cytotoxin which showed similarities to the shiga toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae (O'Brien et al., 1982) . E. coli enteropathogenic for man have been shown to produce a toxin (Konowulchuk et al., 1978) which is biologically and serologically related to the shiga toxin (O'Brien et al., 1982) . The E. coli described here may form a distinctive sub-group in view of their isolation from cattle, their atypical characteristics and their distinctive properties in tests for fimbriae and haemagglutinins. These E. coli produced a mannose-resis-tant haemagglutinin in anaerobic but not aerobic conditions which was of particular interest; apparently the haemagglutinin was not associated with fimbriae. In aerobic conditions these bacteria produced fimbriae without detectable haemagglutinating activity which, although previously described (Isaacson, 1981) , are nonetheless unusual.",
