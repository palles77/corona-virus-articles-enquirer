Three kinds of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ionic liquids with different alkyl chain and anion were investigated. The results indicated that ionic liquids (ILs) showed remarkable effects on the extraction yield of isoflavones. In addition, the ILUAE, including several ultrasonic parameters, such as the concentration, extraction time and solvent to solid ratio have been optimized. Under these optimal conditions (e.g., with 30 min extraction time and the solvent to solid ratio of 30 ml/g), this approach gained the highest extraction yields of tectoridin (37.45 mg/g), iristectorin B (2.88 mg/g) and iristectorin A (5.28 mg/g). Meanwhile, tectoridin, iristectorin B and iristectorin A in the ILUAE extract were separated and purified successfully through the high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) with a twophase solvent system consisting of n-butanol-water (1:1, v/v). The additional advantage of this approach is that 60.21 mg tectoridin, 4.33 mg iristectorin B and 8.24 mg iristectorin A with more than 95.0% purities have been obtained from 400 mg ILUAE extract of I. tectorum within 5 h and one-step elution under the most optimized conditions (e.g., a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min, 900 rpm and the wavelengh of 280 nm). The obtained fractions were successfully analyzed by HPLC and identified by 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR.",

Traditionally, its root and rhizome have been used for the treatment of inflammation, cough, tonsillitis and pharyngitis [1]. More recently, it has been used to fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Therefore, I. tectorum has been listed as therapeutical treatments appeared on the list of treatment therapy, and has caught some doctor's attention as it helps people fight against this new infectious disease. Many studies on chemical compounds have revealed that I. tectorum contains a variety of important chemicals, such as isoflavones [2] [3] [4] , quinones [5] and triterpenoids [6] [7] [8] . These chemical compounds are believed to be responsible for a number of biological activities of anti-atherosclerosis [9] , anti-oxidant [10] and anti-tumor [11] . Meanwhile, these isoflavone compounds are also often used for the quality control of I. Tectorum.",

The stationary phase of HSCCC is retained in the separation columns by gravity and centrifugal force field. Therefore, HSCCC possesses unusual properties such as low solvent consuming, rapid separation and high recovery [20, 21] . Additionally, the significant feature of HSCCC is that it can separate several target compounds in a large-scale simultaneously [22] [23] [24] . This method has been widely applied to the separation and purification of many herb medicines [25] [26] [27] . The present report describes a convenient, efficient and environmentally friendly ionic liquids based on ultrasonic-assisted extraction (ILUAE) method. This method includes the extraction of three isoflavones: tectoridin, iristectorin B and iristectorin A from I. tectorum, and the separation and purification of these three compounds from the obtained ILUAE extract by HSCCC. To our knowledge, this is the first report on application, in combining ILUAE and HSCCC, of extraction, isolation and purification of the active components from I. tectorum (the chemical structures of tectoridin, iristectorin B and iristectorin A were shown in Fig. 1 ).",

However, the differences in the yields of tectoridin, iristectorin B and iristectorin A were not significant (p > 0.05) when the extraction time went up from 30 to 50 min. Because the diffusion front moved towards the interior of the tissues of I. tectorum dried roots, the diffusion area was reduced, but diffusion distance was increased, leading to the lower diffusion rate [29] .

Table 2 listed the solvent polarities (\u03b5) of different two-phase solvent systems and the K-values of the three isoflavones determined by HPLC. These results indicate that the three systems, all involving in light petroleum, have small K-values of three isoflavones (<0.5). This might be due to the fact that the organic polarity effects were negligible and the capability of distribution of three isoflavones in the upper was too small. Then, solvent with increased polarity of ethyl acetate-methanol-water (\u03b5 7.16) and n-butanol-water (\u03b5 6.95) were tried.

Under the optimized ILUAE conditions, the highest extraction yields of tectoridin, iristectorin B and iristectorin A were 37.45, 2.88 and 5.28 mg/g, respectively. Tectoridin, iristectorin B and iristectorin A in the ILUAE extracts have been separated and purified successfully by HSCCC. This approach resulted in 60.21 mg tectoridin, 4.33 mg iristectorin B and 8.24 mg iristectorin A isolated from 400 mg ILUAE extract of I. tectorum dried roots using one-step elution within 5 h. These results indicated that the combination of application of ILUAE and HSCCC is a very powerful technique for the preparative extraction and purification of tectoridin, iristectorin B and iristectorin A from I. tectorum dried roots.",
