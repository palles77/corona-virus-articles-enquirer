Each oligonucleotide was 29 bases long, starting at every 5 th base of every sequence, resulting in an overlap of 24 bases in two consecutive oligonucleotides. The applicability of the array for virus identification was examined using PCR amplified products from multiple HAV and CV strains. PCR products labeled with biotin were hybridized to the array, and the biotin was detected using a brief reaction with Cy3-labeled streptavidin, the array subjected to laser scanning, and the hybridization data plotted as fluorescence intensity against each oligonucleotide in the array. The combined signal intensities of all probes representing a particular strain of virus were calculated and plotted against all virus strains identified on a linear representation of the array. The profile of the total signal intensity identified the strain that is most likely represented in the amplified cDNA target. The results obtained with HAV and CV indicated that the hybridization profile thus generated can be used to identify closely related viral strains. This represents a significant improvement over current methods for virus identification using PCR amplification and amplicon sequencing.",

In the classical culture based method, the principal mode of virus identification uses growth of the virus in permissive cells and observation of the morphological changes brought about by virus replication in the host cell [1] . Although it is possible to differentiate between cytopathic and non-cytopathic hepatitis A virus (HAV) strains due to a difference in the morphology of infected cells [2] , in practice such morphological identification is of limited value because the morphological effects are cell-line specific, and many viruses in the same genus (e.g. Enterovirus) produce rapid and similar cytopathic changes in many of the celllines normally used for virus detection. Moreover, using multiple cell-lines for virus detection is also labor intensive and time consuming, and further confirmation and identification often requires the use of additional techniques such as serotyping [1] .",

For *Address correspondence to this author at the Division of Molecular Biology, Office of Applied Research and Safety Assessment (OARSA), Food and Drug Administration, 8301 Muirkirk Road, HFS-025, Laurel, MD, 20708, USA; Tel: +1-301-210-7812; E-mail: biswendu.goswami@fda.hhs.gov example, the differential identification of strains within a species is possible based on the difference in the size of the amplified PCR product (amplicon) detectable by gel electrophoresis ( [4] or single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) [5] . Indeed, we have utilized agarose gel electrophoresis following RT-PCR using primer pairs straddling a 14 base insertion at the non-coding region of some HAV genomes to identify specific cytopathic strains from noncytopathic strains of HAV [4, 6] . We also reported the use of SSCP analysis following Alu 1 or Hinf 1 digestion of amplicons generated from the 3' end of the viral genome to provide differential identification of multiple HAV strains [5] . However, SSCP is a multi-step procedure involving radiolabeling of restriction fragments prior to electrophoretic separation of individual DNA strands. Consequently, this procedure works best when the restriction fragments are small enough to provide sufficient single-stranded DNA separation for effective strain identification. For genetically wellconserved viruses such as HAV, the region to be amplified for SSCP analysis has to be carefully chosen in order to represent areas of reasonable diversity [7, 8] . Due to these considerations, it has been preferable to sequence the PCR amplified DNA fragment in order to specifically identify the genotypes or strains of the viruses. While sequencing amplified PCR products is considered a precise technique for identification, PCR amplification of a mixed population of target sequences may be biased in favor of a dominant (by copy number) target such that subsequent sequence analysis may not reveal the presence of other closely related target sequences in starting populations. Putative mixed virus populations (e.g. of the same or different species) can exist in isolates obtained from environmental and infected-host samples particularly those resulting from RNA virus replication that is known to generate a sub-population of \"quasi-species\" [9] . Therefore, a threshold number of RNA molecules must have the same specific mutation in order to be unambiguously detectable by RT-PCR and sequencing, due to possible inhibition of amplification of a less abundant template by template competition [10] . Conversely, the dominant mutation present in a population may be preferentially amplified, and therefore, sequence analysis would represent the dominant mutant [11] . Therefore, while sequencing remains a \"goldstandard\" for target sequence identification, the identification of multiple viral species or tracking species mutations necessitated the development and application of a broader approach to identification prior to undertaking sequence analysis.",

Oligonucleotide probes are synthesized and then immobilized on a solid surface. A target consisting of amplified viral complementary DNA (cDNA) then labeled and hybridized to the immobilized probes and the hybridization to the individual probes detected [12] . The presence of a change in the nucleotide sequence in the target is detected by the absence or the reduction of hybridization to the wild type probes around the change, or by the ratio of the signals generated by a mutant against a reference strain. Modifications of the above technique including the use of amplified viral complementary RNA (cRNA) were used to identify genetic variations arising during cultivation of a vaccine strain of poliovirus and the emergence of vaccine derived poliovirus in immunized patients showing signs of vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis [13, 14] .

Oligonucleotide design was based on available complete viral genome sequences obtained from GenBank for CV (n=25), HAV (n=23), Norovirus genogroup I (n=4), Norovirus genogroup II (n=21), rotavirus (various species) segments 3 (n=11), 4 (n=19), 8 (n=11), and 11 (n=12) where n equals the number sequences obtained for each virus group. All genomic sequences within a virus group were aligned using CLUSTALX [22] , and dendrograms were generated and consensus sequences constructed based on these analyses. Examples of these dendrograms are shown for HAV and CV (Figs. 1, 2 , respectively). For the purpose of generating representative viral genomic sequences on which to base subsequent oligonucleotide designs, the HAV strains were clustered into 5 groups whose viral genome sequences were constructed as follows: i) a consensus sequence based on the seven genotype Ib (i.e. genotype I, subgenotype b) strains that clustered into group 1 which includes the HAV HM175/wt strain (M14707), ii) a sequence derived from M20273 based on the pairing of M20273 and AF314208 (genotype Ib sequences in group 2), iii) a sequence derived from the single HAV genotype II sequence (IIb) available (AY032861) and assigned as group 3, iv) two consensus sequences based on either cluster group 4 or 5 derived from fourteen genotype Ia sequences that were clustered into either of these two groups. The three consensus sequences representing cluster groups 1, 4 and 5 were obtained following a group sequence alignment and the assignment of the most frequently occurring nucleotide at positions containing nucleotide differences. The clustering of either one or two sequences within a group (as in groups 3 and 2, respectively) resulted in the selection of a single sequence representing that group. Due to the highly diverse (genetic) nature of the CV genome sequences, clustering of strains for generating a group consensus sequence was only done for serotype strains B1 and B3 (groups 1 and 2, respectively). Four additional unique strain sequences were selected as representative sequences for broadly clustered strains identified as groups 3-6. Viral genomic sequences (approximately 3000 bases) from either the 3' end of the HAV genome group sequences or the 5' end of the CV genome group sequences were submitted for design of a tiling oligonucleotide array consisting of oligonucleotides of length 29, starting at every 5 th base in every sequence, resulting in an overlap of 24 bases in two consecutive oligonucleotides [15] . Similar methods were applied to the development and tiling of oligonucleotides as probes for norovirus and rotavirus sequences on the array. The resulting array contained approximately 13,000 viral probes.",

To generate the average probe intensity for each probe set per hybridized virus strain, the sum of all normalized probe intensities for individual probes within a probe set (i.e. set of probes derived from an individual strain or group sequence) was divided by the number of probes within that set [15] .",

Indeed, the coxsackievirus genomes are much less conserved and mutations are distributed throughout the genome [23] . Sequence analyses of small segments of different strains of HAV have led to the recognition of six genotypes (I to VI) of this virus [24] .

            "text": "As members of the genus Enterovirus, the Human enterovirus A and Human enterovirus C virus species comprise most of the species assigned to CV serotype A strains with the exception of serotype A9 [23] . Coxsackievirus serotypes B1-6, coxsackievirus serotype A9 (CVA9), enteroviruses 69 and 73 and the majority of echoviruses are classified within the Human enterovirus B species that is one of the largest species group in the family Picornaviridae [26] . Fig. (2) shows the CLUSTALX analysis of the different coxsackievirus serotype strains used for designing the tiling array. For B1 and B3 strains a consensus sequence was developed based on the sequences available for individual members of these groups, whereas single sequences were used for the strains B4, B5, A16 and A21, due to extensive sequence variations between individual members of these groups [23, 26] . Since sequence diversity among the CV strains was distributed over the entire length of the genome, the first 3000 nucleotides were determined to contain sufficient sequence diversity to identify a strain without ambiguity. Identification of HAV Genotype by Microarray Hybridization. Fig. (3) shows the hybridization profile obtained with a target synthesized by PCR amplification of the plasmid pHAV/7. This plasmid contains a copy of the entire HAV sequence of wild-type HM175 strain HM175 [19, 27] that originated from an Australian outbreak, and was designated as genotype Ib by subsequent sequence analysis [24, 28] . The hybridization signals (normalized probe intensities) produced a profile indicating areas of intense hybridization at the position where the HAV sequences are clustered in the array. However, variations in the intensity of hybridization can be observed within these sequences, where the target hybridization intensities against group 1 probes (hav1Cb) differ from probes derived from groups 2 through 5 (hav2b, hav3b, hav4Cb and hav5Cb) sequences. This is more clearly observed in Fig. (4) , where the normalized probe intensities for individual probes within each group sequence present in the array were converted to average probe intensities and plotted for the target. The plot reveals that the HAV genotype 1b (HM175 wild-type) target hybridized most efficiently to probes from genotype Ib, group 1 consensus sequence (hav1cb). These results are consistent with the fact that the viral genome sequence for HAV HM 175 wt strain (14707) is a member of, and therefore most closely related to, group 1 derived probe sequences. Probes representing a closely related HAV Ib strain from group 2 (hav2b) hybridize the target about two thirds as efficiently, while probes from the more genetically distant genotype II virus (hav3b) hybridize with the least intensity. The other probe groups (hav4cb and 5cb) both representing genotype Ia consensus sequences (Fig. 1 , cluster groups 4 and 5) hybridize less efficiently than genotype Ib. Given the readily observable differences in both the normalized and average signal intensities among the genotype group sequence probes (groups 1-5) following genotype Ib target hybridization, and the fact that viruses belonging to different subgenotypes can differ by as much as 7.5% in sequence [21, 24, 28] , the data in Fig. (4) indicate that it is possible to identify HAV strains at the level of both genotype and subgenotype with this type of array.",

Lower efficiencies of hybridization are observed for all three targets against all other probe sets. These results reflect a greater target specificity for the probe set that contains target member sequences than for the other genotype Ib derived probe set (hav2b) that does not contain target member sequences (group 2 in Fig. 1) .

Indeed, a target derived from in vitro synthesized RNA from pHAV/7 (representing in vitro replication of the viral genome) was indistinguishable from plasmid derived target, or the virus following several rounds of replication in culture except for the peak height (data not shown). We pursued, therefore, an alternative method of analysis because the tiling array design offers the potential to distinguish between these closely related strains following hybridization by i) determining the normalized probe intensities for each target, and ii) plotting the change in signal intensity of hybridization by each target to the same probe set as the ratio (fold-change in probe intensity) vs the individual probes. As discussed by Jackson et al. [15] , this method of analysis can reveal distinct peaks with defined slopes (above background/signal noise) where changes in signal strength would occur with probes tiled further up or down stream of the nucleotide change. The presence of a mutation in the genome causes a destabilization of a number of probes around the mutation, which can be identified by the appearance of well defined peaks. Therefore, this method of analysis offers the potential to differentiate closely related strains of virus belonging to subgenotype Ib at the level of individual nucleotide differences, thereby producing data that can be used to tell them apart.",

Again, we found no overall differences in the hybridization profile but rather found peaks of hybridization intensities with the strongest hybridization intensities for the group 1 (HAV1Cb) consensus sequence following calculation of average probe intensity (data not shown). The fold-change in intensity between clone 1 and 18f targets was calculated for each probe in the probe set HAV1Cb. As shown in Fig. (6) , ten well defined peaks were observed over the range of the HAV1Cb probe set and the probe number that corresponds to each peak was identified. It is important to note that due to the initial size of the graphical analysis output, it was necessary to compress the scale of the x-axis (HAV1Cb probe number) in order to fit all data points within a smaller graph. As a result, analysis of the hybridization (signal) values revealed two features not readily discernable on the graph; i) a probable single peak at probe 109 rather than what appears as two adjacent (overlapping) peaks, and ii) a possible second overlapping peak adjacent to probe 441. Since the HAV1Cb probe set (group 1) is a consensus sequence developed from the alignment of seven strains assigned to this group (Fig. 1) , there are nucleotide differences between each group member and the consensus sequence. Plotting the fold-change in intensity between clone 1 and 18f would potentially identify nucleotide sequences in a probe that are identical to clone 1 but not identical to 18f. Indeed, upon comparative analysis of clone1 and 18f amplified target sequences with HAV1Cb probes set sequence synonymous with the target sequences, one would predict a total of 11 peaks to occur by this method of analysis. We then sought to determine whether the \"peak\" probes contained nucleotide differences that could be mapped to nucleotide differences [e.g. single-nucleotide po- Fig. (5) . Comparison of hybridization profiles for three HAV genotype Ib strain targets. Average signal probe intensities were calculated and plotted following hybridization of targets generated as PCR products from reverse transcription of RNA derived from either in vitro transcribed pHAV/7 (black bar), HAV HM175 clone 1 infected cells (white bar) or clarified supernatant from HAV 18f infected cells (grey bar). lymorphisms (SNPs), deletions, or insertions] that exist between clone 1 and 18f (and the probe set). As shown in Table 5, we were able to conservatively detect 10 out of 11 predicted nucleotide changes in the 18f genome identifiable by this method of analysis. It is important to note that these nucleotide changes represent mutations arising in the 18f virus during its emergence as a cytopathic strain from the HM175 noncytopathic strain which were identified by direct sequencing [21] . These results demonstrate a strong correlation between results obtained by direct sequencing and array hybridization and strongly suggest that tiling arrays can be used to detect nucleotide changes instead of sequencing amplified PCR products over a much longer span of the genome in a single experiment.",

Unlike HAV strains, there is tremendous genetic diversity between CV strains, even within the same species as observed, for example, among serotype B strains although they are all members of HEV species [23, 26] . We sought, therefore, to determine whether this array hybridization technique could be used to identify a CV serotype strain target. A typical hybridization profile with a 746 bp segment amplified from CV strains is shown for CVB1 in Fig. (7,  panel A) where the data is presented as average probe intensity for all probes derived from the same group sequence, i.e. probe set. Similar to the results obtained following hybridi-zation with HAV targets, CVB1 targets hybridized very efficiently and with greatest intensity to probes (coxB1Ca) derived from a consensus sequence based on its own sequence, i.e. serotype B1 strains (Fig. 2, group 2) . As indicated by the significantly lower probe intensities, minimal hybridization was observed among the remaining 7 CV probe sets indicating a lower efficiency of hybridization to non-CVB1 sequences represented on the array. In fact, hybridization to probes representing all other (non-CV) viruses was essentially at background signal intensity. The results are consistent with the extensive sequence heterogeneity that exists between the CV serotype A and B virus strains, the members within a serotype (A or B), as well as the probe sets derived from these strains. Importantly, these results demonstrate that even with highly (genetically) diverse viruses, such as coxsackieviruses, this array design can discriminate between strains of the same (or different) virus species. We next sought to determine whether discrimination between virus strains or species was possible when the viral target contains sequences not represented by either an individual or a consensus probe set on the array. To complete this experiment, a 746 bp targets derived from coxsackievirus serotype A3 and A5 strains were hybridized to the array. CVA3 and CVA5 serotype strains are both members of HEA species, however the probes' sequence (group 7, coxA16a) for the species was derived from CVA16 (Fig. 2) . Analysis of normalized probe intensities reveal a striking reduction in the overall level of Fig. (6) . Detection of nucleotide differences between two genetically related HAV strains. Average signal probe intensities were calculated following hybridization of targets generated as PCR products from reverse transcription of RNA derived from HAV HM175 clone 1 infected cells or clarified supernatant from HAV 18f infected cells.

The individual points on the graph represent specific probe numbers; however, due to graphical compression of the original data, there are iterative probes not represented by individual points on the graph. Arrows identify the probe number having the peak intensity difference between clone 1 and 18f where a nucleotide(s) present in the consensus sequence is identical to nucleotide(s) in clone 1 but not identical to nucleotide(s) in 18f.",

As shown in Fig. (7, panels B and C) , this is also observed following conversion to average probe intensity. The peak average probe intensity for these hybridizations is approximately 2750 units and 900 units with CVA3 and CVA5 targets, respectively. The results indicate that in the absence of matching probe sets on the array the sequence heterogeneity between these CV targets and the existing probe sets precludes the establishment of any strong or efficient hybridization to a single probe set. It is important to note, however, that neither of these targets hybridizes with any significance to non-CV probe sets suggesting that the genetic diversity between CV targets and probe sets does not prevent or obscure virus target group (i.e. CV) identification. In addition, these hybridization profiles are not only distinct from B1 (Fig. 7) but also from one another suggesting the possibility that unique hybridization profile patterns (calculated as normalized and/or averaged probe intensity) could be used for CV serotype target identification. The results from Fig. (7) also suggest that in a single experiment it is possible to identify whether a virus belongs to group A or group B. Indeed, identification of coxsackieviruses at the level of serotype strain may be possible without single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and limited only by the number of probe sequences/sets present on the array.",

This allows easy identification of a virus at the genotype level by sequencing discrete segments of the viral genome amplified by RT-PCR. Ideally, sequencing should be done on amplicons that are known to have multiple nucleotide differences between strains. However, designing PCR primers that will capture a significant number of members of that group requires significant sequence homology, and therefore, a relatively variable region flanked by conserved regions is needed for sequence based identification. While for some virus groups such as HAV it is relatively easy to find PCR primers that can capture many members, it is much more difficult with CV genomes due to extreme sequence diversity. The length of the amplified region is another constraint for sequence based identification. Sequencing an amplicon larger that 500 bp generally will require designing multiple primers for sequence walking. Although automated sequencing techniques currently available can be used for rapid sequencing of a moderate sized amplicon, the process is still too time consuming to be used on a routine basis where a quick identification is needed. a Detection of (putative) nucleotide differences by array hybridization between clone 1 and 18f was initially based on the hybridization profile in Fig. (6) . b Probe numbers are from Fig. (6) and represent the oligonucleotide probes whose sequence contains nucleotide change(s) between clone 1 and 18f when the clone 1 target sequence is identical to the probe sequence. Nucleotide changes were indentified (grey boxed) based on comparison of the clone 1 and 18f GenBank sequences (accession numbers in Fig. (1) ) used to develop the HAV1Cb group 1 consensus probe set (Fig. 1) .

Unlike sequencing, these arrays can interrogate thousands of bases of a viral genome in a single experiment [15] [16] [17] . We determined the feasibility of this approach by using labeled targets amplified from either the DNA (i.e. as recombinant plasmid) or RNA from several strains of HAV and CV. As shown in Figs. (4-6) , a single hybridization experiment using a multi-well array with different samples loaded in different wells of a 12-well sample pod can identify HAV and CVB by the unique profile generated with no ambiguity or crosshybridization to oligonucleotides representing an unrelated virus. Within the broad genus of hepatovirus of which HAV is the only species member, different genotypes which differ from each other by 5% to 8% of base positions (Fig. 1) can be identified (Figs. 4-6) . Within the same subgenotye Ib, strains such as wild type HM175 and the cell culture adapted variants including the cytopathic 18f strain differ by only 0.5% of base positions. We have shown that differentiation of these strains is possible by analyzing the ratio of the signal probe intensities generated by the isolates when hybridized to the probe sets present on this tiling array ( Fig. 6 and Table 5 ). A sequence based identification of the same 3.7 kb amplicon would require several sequencing reactions with multiple primers in order to identify nucleotide differences. In addition, mutations accumulating in the HM175 genome during its evolution into the cytopathic 18f strain can be identified by ratio analysis (Fig. 6 and Table 5 ). Thus, the present array design is suitable for identification of species (e.g. CV and HAV) and HAV subgenotypes since in the latter case the nucleotide differences are very few.",

The probe hybridization values (intensities) were plotted as normalized probe intensities vs all probe sequences. The graphical output was compressed to include all probes represented on the array. As a result, individual probe sequence identifiers are not listed on the plot. Probe set identifiers (under solid line) are given for each of the virus species (under double-headed arrow) represented on the array where CV, HAV, NV and RV represent coxsackievirus, hepatitis A virus, norovirus and rotavirus, respectively.",
