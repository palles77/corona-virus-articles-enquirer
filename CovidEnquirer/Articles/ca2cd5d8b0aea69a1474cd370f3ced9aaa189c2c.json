Accordingly, a cross-sectional survey of 2768 households was conducted using a postal questionnaire. The 2006 Sydney residential phone book was used as the sampling frame. Non-responders were re-mailed the questionnaire on two further occasions, 2 and 4 weeks after the first posting. Completed questionnaires were received from 884 households. No pets were kept by 387 (43.8%) respondents. Dogs and cats were owned by 295 (33.4%) and 198 (22.5%) of households, respectively, with 7.8% of households having both cat(s) and dog(s). Fish and birds were the next most popular pets. Of the 198 cat-owning households, 54.0% kept only cat(s), while 46.5% kept cats with other pets. The distribution of cat ownership across Sydney was non-uniform. Each cat-owning household kept 1.3 cats on average, with the majority keeping one (75.8% households) or two (18.7%). For the 260 cats, the mean age was 7.1 years, the median 6 years, with a range of 3 months to 22 years. There were significantly more female (143; 55%) than male cats (117; 45%). Only seven cats (2.7%) were sexually entire, and these were all 6 years. Crossbred cats outnumbered pedigree cats by a ratio of 3.3:1. The Burmese was the most common breed, followed by the Persian. The median age of pedigree cats (5.5 years) was significantly lower than for domestic crossbred cats (7.0 years). Most cats were housed both indoors and outdoors (72.6%), with 19.7% being restricted to indoors and/or 'pet park enclosures'. Pedigree cats were significantly more likely than crossbreds to be housed indoors. Most owners fed their cats a combination of commercial dry and canned food (38.1%), although fresh meat was popular also and either fed alone (1.6%) or in combination with dry food (14.4%), tinned food (1.6%) or canned and dry food (25.8%). A diet consisting of dry food alone was fed to cats in 13.4% of households. Ninety percent of cats had been vaccinated at least once, while 72.2% received a vaccination in the last 3 years. Older cats were less likely to have been vaccinated recently than younger cats. Only 5.8% of cats had never visited a veterinarian. For the 243 cats that had received veterinary attention, the average number of years since the last visit was 1.5.",

The same is equally true for human populations, and this is one of the reasons a census is conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics at regular intervals (http://www.abs.gov.au/). The key demographic factors germane to feline disease associations are age, gender, reproductive status (neutered versus entire) and breed. Other key husbandry factors that may impact on disease prevalence are lifestyle (indoor versus outdoor; sedentary versus active; single versus multi-cat household), diet and access to regular veterinary attention (for preventative health measures, eg, vaccination, parasite control, dental attention).",

Although limited information from these surveys concerning cat population dynamics has appeared, 3 further relevant details have been withheld. The development of a simple but accurate model of the Australian feline pet population by the late Chris Baldock and colleagues has been of fundamental importance. Using this model, Baldock et al 3 reported a decline in the proportion of Australian cat-owning households from 31% in 1994 to 26% in 1999. The number of cats per household remained relatively constant (at 1.5) over the same time period. The estimated total number of owned cats declined from 3.2 million in 1988 to 2.6 million in 1999, with 2.1 million predicted in 2005. This decrease in cat numbers was said to be a consequence of high rates of neutering (prior to reproduction) and a decline in the number of households taking up cat ownership. This was reflected by a small number of young cats in 'age pyramids' of the feline population, corresponding to a net decrease in the replacement rate of cats into the population, relative to the net rate of loss due to all causes. It was further predicted that this trend would continue, with a compound annual decrease of more than 1.9%.",

Although better than nothing, this type of data is flawed. Firstly, many cats attending clinics are unwell and, therefore, not reflective of the reference population (comprised largely of healthy cats). Secondly, inclusion of disproportionately large numbers of young animals presented for vaccination and desexing introduces a potential source of bias. Thirdly, the veracity of the data recorded and captured by computerised software systems may be unreliable because of transcriptional and recording errors. Fourthly, an unknown proportion of owners do not present their cat(s) for regular veterinary attention, and this may be a reflection of socioeconomic factors such as household wealth which may indirectly impact on feline health. Finally, many studies have come from university veterinary clinics, and consequently are further biased by inclusion of many referred cases which may be even less representative of the wider cat population than cases seen at first opinion practices.",

Although the response rate achieved was less than anticipated (resulting in the recruitment of less cat-owning households), we consider it to be within acceptable limits given the sampling frame used. Other recent surveys of animal owners using a similar approach but using targeted sampling frames (eg, client lists of equine veterinary practices; owner list of a dog kennel club) achieved response rates of 50.1e65.7% with return to sender losses of 7.2e21.8%. 22e24 The low return to sender loss of 7.2% achieved by Hotchkiss et al 24 is likely due to mailing software used to verify horse owner addresses supplied by veterinary clinics prior to first posting. This study, in contrast, despite considerable effort taken with questionnaire design and administration, achieved a lower response rate due to use of a non-targeted sampling frame and the lower priority questionnaire return for ordinary households compared to horse or pedigree dog-owning households. However, given the study objective, use of a non-targeted sampling frame in this study was essential to ensure representation of all types of pet cat-owning households, and for future work, the response rate achieved clearly demonstrated that a general survey will obtain fewer responses than a targeted survey. Considering that 2768 households were initially contacted, the difficulty and cost of obtaining a substantial dataset by using a well designed cross-sectional survey is easily appreciated. We estimate that the cost of conducting this survey was in excess of $A10,000 (to cover postage of three mail outs, stationary, inducements and database management), not counting the labour provided gratis by students, Centre for Veterinary Education (CVE) staff and coauthors. Similar to other researchers seeking to obtain information on pet demographics and management, we encountered issues that introduced bias. Use of the telephone directory as the sampling frame for random recruitment of households introduced selection bias. By definition, people without a land line were not included and this may have excluded households of especially low socioeconomic standing. Likewise, households using a mobile phone exclusively or using broad band internet telephony would not have been sampled, possibly underestimating certain demographic groups. In addition, we are aware that some envelopes returned due to insufficient address details belonged to households living in large apartment complexes that could not be delivered due to lack of the apartment number. With the benefit of hindsight, we may have been better served by using randomly selected entries from the electoral rolls, as data on the specific residential address and the exact postcode were more complete than in the phone book. However, choosing the electoral roll as the sampling frame would also have introduced selection bias due to under-representation of certain demographic groups and to loss of households due to outdated address information (unless conducted in close proximity to an election).",

Interestingly, 45% of households in Perth likewise did not have any pets in a telephone survey conducted 17 years ago. 25 It may be in the interest of veterinarians, pet food manufacturers or animal welfare groups to define the social and demographic features of this group, so it can be more effectively targeted for the proactive acquisition of appropriate pets. It was not surprising that dogs and cats were the most popular pets, living in approximately 33% and 23% of households, respectively, with 8% of households owning both cat(s) and dog(s). A survey of pet ownership in Perth 25 found quite similar findings, with 34.1% of households owning a dog, 28.6% owning a cat, with both dog(s) and cat(s) being owned by 5.6% of households. Our data are in general agreement with the predicted decline in the percentage of cat-owning households reported for Australia as a whole (from 31% to 26% over the period 1994e1999). 3 It is not possible to say whether the further decline in cat ownership in Sydney (to 23% in 2006) is a real phenomenon reflecting the trend demonstrated previously, or attributable to a difference between cats in the Sydney region compared to cats recruited from around the whole country. The former seems more likely, given that industry data continues to indicate the Australian cat population is in decline, with estimates in the popular press suggesting the current owned cat population to be 2.1 million. The continuing decrease in the number of pet cats in Australia contrasts with the increasing popularity of the cat as a companion animal in North America and the UK, where it has superseded the dog in most recent surveys. 26 Indeed, in the USA, the compound annual increase in the cat population is said to be somewhere between 1.2 and 1.9%, 6,26 while the figure in the UK is 1.9% (Magnosi 1999; cited by Ref. 3 ). The lack of duplication of this trend in Australia, despite lifestyle changes which make cat ownership arguably more rational than dog ownership (as cats have greater independence; less requirement for exercise; less food, boarding and veterinary expenses, etc.), re-emphasises issues raised previously by Baldock et al. 3 A number of strategies can be suggested to help reverse this trend. Firstly, promoting responsible cat ownership with restriction of cats largely to indoors would reduce publicity associated with the alleged negative impact of pet cats on wildlife. Secondly, placing greater emphasis on proactive cat ownership (eg, through veterinary or industry subsidised cat adoption schemes) may result in increased take-up of cats into households. Finally, embracing breeding and showing of domestic crossbred cats and promotion of their sale through appropriate outlets would specifically assist in the decline of the outbred domestic cat population. This might circumvent problems associated with a higher proportion of pedigree cats, such as a larger number of genetically programmed disease conditions. The large number of households that kept fish is noteworthy, and should be considered by small animal clinicians and veterinary educationalists when constructing curricula and continuing education programs, considering that this species is more commonly kept than birds, rabbits, ferrets or 'pocket pets'.",

It was interesting that few owners commented on feeding chicken wings or drumsticks, or other types of 'raw meaty bones', despite the perceived health and behavioural benefits of eating this type of ration as a component of the diet. 28, 29 Interestingly, some 13% of households fed a diet consisting exclusively of dry cat food; the majority of these (18/26 households) fed 'premium diets' obtained from veterinarians or pet stores. Recent data have emphasised that it is 'unphysiological' to exclusively feed a calorically dense, high fat/high carbohydrate diet to a species that evolved as an obligate carnivore. 30 Feeding of such high glycaemic index diets, especially when they are fed 'free choice' (ie, virtually ad libutum), has been linked with the development of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hepatic lipidosis, osteoarthritis and idiopathic cystitis. 30e33 As pedigree cats were more likely to be fed such diets according to our survey, the increased risk of these conditions in certain breeds may be related to dietary factors, additional genetic predispositions, or the interaction between these factors.",

Although there is no direct evidence, possible explanations may include changes in husbandry and preventative disease measures, such as vaccination, widespread neutering, increased dental care, decreased free-roaming tom cats, and implementation of 'cat curfews', with attendant health benefits of reduced vehicular trauma events, less cat fight infections and so forth.

Conditions previously documented to have a male preponderance, such as FIV infection 15, 16 lymphosarcoma, 20 nocardiosis, 18 feline infectious peritonitis 11 and cryptococcosis 17 would be even more likely to be strongly linked with male gender considering the data for normal cats presented here.",

Alternatively, pedigree cats may actually be more likely to develop various disease conditions than crossbred cats.

Only 19.7% of cats were limited to indoors and/or 'modular pet park' type enclosures, with pedigree cats four times more likely to be housed in this fashion than crossbreds. Although there may be some behavioural issues with an exclusively indoor lifestyle, there is no doubt in the authors view that cats restricted to an environmentally enriched indoors setting and prevented from becoming obese have substantial health and longevity benefits compared to cats with access to outdoors, with the attendant risks of vehicular trauma, degenerative joint disease (from jumping and falling) and diseases transmitted by cat fights, including FIV.",

There was a trend for pedigree cats to have more likely received a vaccination during the preceding 12 months compared to crossbred cats. Older cats were significantly less likely to have been vaccinated in the preceding 3 years compared to younger cats. Although this possibly echoes the recent trend to recommend 3-yearly vaccinations for mature cats, it also may equally reflect owner's perceptions that older cats require less frequent vaccinations.",

This suggests that most cat owners are prepared to regularly seek veterinary services as required, or to respond to postal reminder systems for annual 'wellness examinations'. The reported reason for veterinary visits includes a broad range of ailments and procedures. Vaccinations, neutering, traumatic injuries including cat fight abscesses and teeth/gum issues accounted for the majority of consultations. Similar to the finding for vaccination, older cats were significantly more likely to have visited a veterinarian >1 year ago compared to younger cats. This reduction in likelihood of veterinary attention with age probably reflects that neutering and traumatic injury are less common among older cats and also that some owners believe they require less frequent vaccinations.",
