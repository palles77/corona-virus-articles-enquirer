Methods: Respiratory specimens collected within the national surveillance system were tested for influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and human metapneumovirus. Overall and virus-specific positive detection rate (PDR) were calculated and compared the timing of epidemics caused by the different viruses. Logistic regression models were used to compare the age distribution and risk of death across respiratory viruses. Results: A total of 41,172 specimens were analyzed: influenza (PDR = 14.3%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (PDR = 9.5%) were the most frequently detected viruses. Influenza epidemics typically peaked in December-January and RSV epidemics in March; seasonality was less evident for the other viruses. Compared to adults, children were more frequently infected with RSV, adenovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza B, while the elderly were less frequently infected with influenza A(H1N1)p. The age-adjusted risk of death was highest for A(H1N1)p (odds ratio [OR] 1.73, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.38-2.17), and lowest for RSV (OR 0.75, 95%CI 0.57-0.98). Conclusions: Whilst influenza and RSV were the most frequently detected pathogens, the risk of death differed by RVI, being highest for pandemic influenza and lowest for RSV.",

Because of their widespread diffusion and potentially severe complications, RVIs are a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, particularly in developing countries and among children under five years of age [3, 4] . The causal agents of RVIs include influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, and others [1] [2] [3] . Most RVIs typically present with nonspecific symptoms like cough, fever and rhinorrhoea, but the causal viruses may largely differ between one another in terms of epidemiology, temporal appearance throughout the year, age distribution, and severity [5] . In addition, while influenza can be prevented by vaccination and treated with antivirals, there are currently no vaccines or therapeutics of proven efficacy for most other respiratory viruses [6] [7] [8] .",

This is particularly important in low-and middle-income tropical countries, where RVIs place a massive burden on relatively fragile healthcare systems and have the highest socioeconomic impact.",

Because of the short duration, limited geographical coverage, and small sample size (679 specimens overall), data from this period were not used in the analyses. From week 20/2009 to week 9/2011, a universal surveillance scheme was implemented whereby all ILI and SARI patients presenting at all hospitals, local health units, airports and harbours in the country were swabbed. Finally, from week 10/2011 until the end of the study period, a sentinel surveillance scheme for SARI was in place that included selected hospitals and local health units in the whole country.",

The overall PDR was 26.8%, with influenza and RSV accounting for most test-positive specimens. Comparing the overall and virus-specific PDR between studies is made problematic by the variability of factors like the demographic structure of the country, the surveillance scheme and the clinical features of patients being sampled, the sampling techniques being used [15] , and the laboratory procedures and assays (which may vary in terms of number of respiratory pathogens that can be detected) [16] . By and large, a viral aetiology could be established in a smaller number of patients compared to previous studies [5, [17] [18] [19] [20] , which might be explained by the failure to detect common causes of RVIs like rhinovirus, coronavirus, and others [21] . Viral interference between epidemics of influenza and RSV was observed previously [22, 23] . This phenomenon seems to affect other respiratory viruses as well (like rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus and others [22] [23] [24] ), although it was not possible to verify this in the available data due to limited numbers. Viral interference is associated with prolonged shedding from the primary virus infection in ferret influenza models [25] , and hypothesized mechanisms include the production of interferon and other cytokines by infected cells [26] . There was an evident, yet distinct seasonality for influenza (two main periods of activity, in December-January and June-August, consistently with previous reports [10, 27] ) and RSV (in March), and a less evident pattern for parainfluenza. Ecuador is a geographically and climatically diverse country, and meteorological parameters like humidity, temperature, and rainfall are known to affect virus survival and transmissibility [18, 28] . Viral interference, diverse association with climatic parameters and other factors [29] may contribute to shape the seasonal cycles of RVIs in Ecuador, although their relative importance is difficult to establish.",

RSV has two major antigenic group (A and B), but some antigenic variability may also occur within each group [30] ; its reproduction number is high (between 5 and 7) [31] and immunity wanes over time [32] . Because of these features, RSV has the highest incidence among young children but causes repeat infections throughout life and represents a health threat for the elderly as well [33] . RSV infection can also induce cross-protection against human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus, affecting the epidemiological dynamics of those pathogens [34, 35] . Influenza viruses evolve via antigenic drift and (only for type A virus) antigenic shift, and novel variants are introduced constantly into the community. The A(H3N2) subtype has shown an accelerated mutation accumulation rate in recent years [36, 37] , which may explain its higher incidence in the elderly compared to other (sub)types.",

The high incidence among infants and the greater severity among the elderly explain why these population subgroups suffer the largest RVI burden of disease [1, 4] . After adjusting by age, patients infected with A(H1N1)p had a 73% higher risk of death compared to test-negative patients. This is consistent with recent literature reports and contrasts the common belief that the most clinically severe influenza virus subtype is A(H3N2) [38] . In contrast, RSV patients had a significantly reduced risk of death compared to test-negative patients. Given the high raw CFR (4.8%) of test-negative patients, a possible explanation is that the latter could actually be infected with untested viruses (e.g. coronaviruses, bocaviruses, or respiratory enteroviruses), bac-teria (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, or Chlamydophila pneumoniae), or other micro-organisms [39] , some of which may cause a more severe disease (i.e. with a higher CFR) than RSV.",

The study has some limitations as well. The surveillance system underwent a major transition during the period covered by the study, and patients with different syndromes were sampled in different sub-periods: although all analyses were stratified or adjusted to account for this change, some residual confounding cannot be ruled out. No information was available on patients' vaccination status, underlying conditions, and use of antivirals and antibiotics. While influenza viruses were searched by RT-PCR throughout the study period, the identification of the other respiratory viruses was performed using direct immunofluorescence, which is a less sensitive technique [40] . Therefore, the PDR for viruses other than influenza may be underestimated.",
