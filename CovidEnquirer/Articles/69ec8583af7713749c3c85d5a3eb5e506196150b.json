            "text": "Cell death coincides with the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn are associated with poor outcome in patients with sepsis (Ayala et al., 1996; Hotchkiss et al., 1997 Hotchkiss et al., , 1999 Hotchkiss et al., , 2003 Isogai et al., 1998; Oberholzer et al., 2001; van der Poll and Opal, 2008) . Specifically, the caspase-11-dependent cell death pathway has been shown by multiple groups to exacerbate pathologies in an LPS-induced sepsis mouse model (Kayagaki et al., 2011 (Kayagaki et al., , 2013 Hagar et al., 2013) . Caspase-11 is a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that plays a critical role in responding to cytosolic LPS during Gram-negative bacterial infection and sepsis (Kayagaki et al., 2011 (Kayagaki et al., , 2013 Aachoui et al., 2013; Hagar et al., 2013) . In multiple cell types, caspase-11 expression is induced after initial detection of LPS by TLR4, through Myd88, TRIF, and interferon signaling pathways (Broz and Monack, 2011; Kayagaki et al., 2011; Rathinam et al., 2012; Hagar et al., 2013) . Caspase-11 is produced as a monomeric zymogen that dimerizes and activates upon detection of cytosolic LPS (Kang et al., 2000) . Upon activation of caspase-11, the cell succumbs to pyroptotic cell death, activates caspase-1, and releases proinflammatory mediators (Kang et al., 2000; Hagar et al., 2013; Kayagaki et al., 2011 Kayagaki et al., , 2013 . Caspase-11-dependent release of proinflammatory mediators into the extracellular space during LPS-induced sepsis contributes to host mortality (Kayagaki et al., 2011 (Kayagaki et al., , 2013 Hagar et al., 2013) . In humans, caspase-4 and -5 are orthologues to caspase-11 (Shi et al., 2014; Casson et al., 2015) , making this an intriguing cell death pathway to understand in the context of sepsis. Thus, an increased understanding of the regulation of caspase-4/5/11dependent cell death pathway may lead to the identification of novel targets for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.",

            "text": "To identify new mediators of caspase-11-dependent cell death, we used a genome-wide CRI SPR-Cas9 knockout screen in macrophages. The results of our screen highlight the complexity of caspase-11 gene expression. Specifically, we identified carboxypeptidase B1 (Cpb1), a complement-related protein, as a novel mediator of caspase-11 gene expression and subsequent caspase-11-dependent cell death in macrophages. Cpb1 modifies a cleavage product of C3, which binds to and activates C3aR, and then modulates innate immune signaling. Here, we elucidate the role of the Cpb1-C3-C3aR pathway in enhancing cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous inflammation by amplifying TLR4-and Ifnar-dependent expression of proinflammatory genes, including caspase-11, within macrophages. We find that TLR4-and Ifnar-signaling pathways, but not Ifngr signaling, converge at p38 MAPK signaling downstream of C3aR activation, highlighting the specificity of this amplification signaling pathway. We identified a role for C3aR, a key mediator of the Cpb1-C3-C3aR signaling pathway, in the early production of proinflammatory mediators, including caspase-11, in vivo and to the severity and outcome of disease in an endotoxemia model of severe sepsis. Furthermore, using a C3aR inhibitor, we show that C3aR may be a candidate for early therapeutic targeting during sepsis.",

LPS and CTB treatment of WT BMDMs results in \u223c60% cell death within 16 h post-treatment (pt; Fig. 1 A) . Similar to previous studies, this death is caspase-11 dependent and caspase-1 independent (Fig. 1 A; Hagar et al., 2013; Kayagaki et al., 2013) . To create a genetically tractable model for caspase-11-dependent cell death, we recapitulated this cell death phenotype in a murine-transformed macrophage cell line, RAW264.7 (RAW). Treatment of WT RAW cells with LPS and CTB for 16 h results in death of \u223c80% of the cells, which is similar to WT BMDMs ( Fig. 1 B) . Additionally, the requirement of CTB for LPS-induced cell death can be bypassed by transfecting LPS into RAW cells, resulting in \u223c40% cell death 16 h pt, similar to BMDMs (Fig. 1 B ; Hagar et al., 2013; Kayagaki et al., 2013) . Together, these data demonstrate that RAW macrophages respond to intracellular LPS comparably to BMDMs.",

We found that intracellular LPS induced cell death primarily in a caspase-11-dependent, caspase-1-independent manner ( Fig. 1 B) . Important to note, caspase-1 is directly upstream of caspase-11 on Chromosome 9 in C57BL/6J mice, thus we checked if disruption of either of these genes affected the other (Kang et al., 2000) . Disruption of caspase-11 did not affect the protein levels of caspase-1, and vice versa (unpublished data). We went on to complement the disrupted caspase-11 gene by expressing a WT copy of caspase-11 tagged at the C terminus with FLAG/HA under the pMSCV promoter. The complemented cell line restored the cell death phenotype to 50% of the WT RAW cell death (Fig. 1 B) . Together, these data show that RAW cells are a genetically tractable model and can be used to study caspase-11-dependent cell death in macrophages.",

As confirmation of our method, our top hit was B4galnt1, which is a gene required for the production of the CTB receptor (GM1 sphingolipid; Fig. 1 D; Wolf et al., 2008; Papatheodorou et al., 2011; Chinnapen et al., 2012; Jobling et al., 2012) . Although caspase-11 was not enriched in our screen, it is possible that the caspase-11 gRNAs present in the library were ineffective or lost during amplification of the library. To verify four of our top novel hits, we created knockout RAW cell lines using the gRNAs identified from the screen and treated them with CTB and LPS for 16 h. RAW cells deficient for three of these hits showed a cell death defect after 16 h of CTB and LPS treatment, whereas the Acsl6 KO cell line displayed similar levels of cell death compared with WT RAW cells (Fig. 1 E) . To ensure that these genes were required for caspase-11-dependent cell death, and not CTB-dependent delivery of LPS into the cytosol, we transfected LPS into each knockout cell line. While most of our knockout cell lines had decreased levels of cell death after transfection with LPS compared with WT cells, only the Cpb1KO cell line displayed significant defects after treatment with CTB and LPS, as well as LPS transfection ( Fig. 1 E) . Together, these data demonstrate that the CRI SPR-Cas9 genome-wide screening method in RAW macrophages is a useful tool to identify novel genes, such as Cpb1, involved in the caspase-11-dependent cell death pathway.",

In concordance with our previous data, there were lower levels of pro-casp11 in the SN from Cpb1 KO cells compared with the WT cells after CTB and LPS treatment ( Fig. 1 K) . In addition, the caspase-11 p30 cleavage product was not detected in the SN from Cpb1 KO cells treated with LPS and CTB ( Fig. 1 K) . As expected, pro-casp11 and p30 were not detected in the SN from Casp11 KO cell line 16 h pt with LPS and CTB ( Fig. 1 K) . Interestingly, the level of pro-casp11 in the lysates of Cpb1 KO cells treated with LPS was markedly lower compared with the WT cells treated with LPS suggesting that Cpb1 may contribute to cell death by controlling the level of caspase-11 gene expression ( Fig. 1 K) . To test this notion, we expressed a WT copy of caspase-11 on an exogenous vector and measured cell death in response to LPS and CTB.

To analyze the contribution of Cpb1 to TLR4-dependent caspase-11 gene expression, we treated WT and Cpb1 KO cells with LPS for 2 h to initiate TLR4-dependent expression of proinflammatory genes and measured expression of caspase-11 by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine transcript levels. Similar to previous studies, the level of caspase-11 transcript in WT cells is significantly increased after 2-h treatment with extracellular LPS (Fig. 1 L) . In contrast, the level of caspase-11 gene expression in the Cpb1 KO cell line did not increase after 2 h of extracellular LPS treatment ( Fig. 1 L) . Of note, caspase-1, which is not influenced by TLR4-dependent signaling, was unaffected in WT and Cpb1 KO cells ( Fig. 1 L) . Thus, our results indicate that Cpb1 is required for WT levels of caspase-11 expression, activation, and cell death in response to cytosolic LPS.",

Murine Cpb1 is the orthologue to human CPB, which modifies C3a, a 77-aa anaphylatoxin generated by enzymatic cleavage of C3 during activation of the complement system (Leung et al., 2008) . CPB cleaves the C-terminal arginine of C3a to create C3a-desArg (Moore and Benoiton, 1978; Leung et al., 2008) . This modified molecule, C3a-desArg, engages the C3aR receptor, a complement receptor that belongs to the rhodopsin family of seven transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptors expressed on both BM-derived myeloid and lymphoid cells (Crass et al., 1996; Martin et al., 1997; Zwirner et al., 1999) . Activation of C3aR leads to modulation of innate immune responses during LPS stimulation and Gram-negative bacterial infections, including induction of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF (Takabayashi et al., 1996; Mueller-Ortiz et al., 2006) . C3aR activation has been shown to mediate expression of TLR4-dependent transcripts (Zhang et al., 2007) . Thus, Cpb1 may modulate TLR4-dependent expression of proinflammatory cytokines through complement receptor C3aR (see also Fig. 7) .",

The defect in expression of il-6 and tnf transcripts corresponded with a significant reduction in IL-6 and TNF cytokine release from C3aR \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs compared with the WT BMDMs (Fig. 2 H) . Although the C3 \u2212/\u2212 and C3aR \u2212/\u2212 mice were generated in an Sv129 embryonic background these mice were thoroughly backcrossed and do not retain the known Sv129 5 base-pair deletion at the caspase-11 genetic locus (Fig. S2) . These data demonstrate that the Cpb1-C3-C3aR pathway is required in transformed macrophages, as well as primary macrophages for expression and release of TLR4-dependent proinflammatory mediators, highlighting its importance for caspase-11-dependent cell death in response to intracellular LPS.",

As expected, there was an amplification of caspase-11 and NOS2 transcripts in WT BMDMs treated with IFN-\u03b2 for 2 h (Fig. 3 A) . In contrast, the levels of caspase-11 and NOS2 transcripts were significantly lower in the C3aR \u2212/\u2212 and C3 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages treated with IFN-\u03b2 for 2 h compared with WT BMDMs (Fig. 3 A) .

Collectively, these data indicate that the Cpb1-C3-C3aR signaling pathway is important for amplification of Ifnar-dependent signaling, but not Ifngr-dependent signaling, during the first 2 h after cytokine stimulation. Surprisingly, this is the first demonstration of C3aR-dependent amplification of Ifnar-dependent signaling. Our results indicate that signaling through the Cpb1-C3-C3aR pathway amplifies TLR4-dependent signaling and type I interferon-stimulated Ifnar signaling in macrophages, but not Ifngr-dependent signaling (see also Fig. 7 ).",

We measured phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase as a read-out of MAPK family activity, to identify the level of MAP kinase activation in WT versus complement-deficient macrophages after various stimuli. After 2 h of treatment with LPS, p38 phosphorylation in WT BMDMs increases sixfold, whereas the C3aR \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs show approximately twofold induction of p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C) . Additionally, when BMDMs are treated with IFN-\u03b2 for 2 h, there is a twofold increase of p38 phosphorylation in WT cells compared with a less than onefold induction in C3aR \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs. In congruence WT, Cpb1 KO, or C3aR KO RAW macrophages were treated with LPS for 2 h and supernatants were added to naive Cpb1 KO cells for 2 h.

To test this, we treated WT, Cpb1KO, and C3aR KO RAW macrophages with LPS for 2 h and collected the supernatants. We then treated naive Cpb1 KO cells with the supernatants for 2 h and looked for expression of proinflammatory transcripts. When Cpb1 KO cells were treated with the conditioned WT or C3aR supernatants, both of which have functioning Cpb1 within the supernatants, caspase-11, IL-6, and TNF transcripts were significantly up-regulated compared with Cpb1 KO cells treated with conditioned supernatants from Cpb1 KO cells (Fig. 3 D) .

Treatment with LPS and CTB or transfection of LPS efficiently delivers LPS into the cytosol of macrophages, which mimics cytosolic infiltration of LPS during active intracellular Gram-negative bacterial infection (Kayagaki et al., 2011 (Kayagaki et al., , 2013 Hagar et al., 2013) . The LPS from intracellular Gram-negative pathogens Salmonella Typhimurium and Shigella flexneri have been shown to engage the caspase-11-dependent cell death pathway in macrophages during infection (Aachoui et al., 2013; Hagar et al., 2013; Kayagaki et al., 2013 Kayagaki et al., , 2015 . We have shown that the Cpb1-C3-C3aR pathway is required for WT levels of caspase-11 protein expression, and subsequent caspase-11-dependent cell death, when exposed to cytosolic LPS. Thus, we hypothesize that the Cpb1-C3-C3aR pathway will be required for caspase-11-dependent cell death during S. Typhimurium and S. flexneri infections. During S. Typhimurium infection, \u223c30% of WT RAW cells are dead 18 h after infection (MOI, 100:1), whereas infected Casp11 KO RAW cells exhibited no detectable cell death above background (\u223c10%; Fig. 4 A) . Interestingly, the levels of cell death in Cpb1 KO, C3aR KO, and C3 KO cell lines infected with S. Typhimurium were similar to those in the infected Casp11 KO cell line (Fig. 4 A) . Additionally, RAW macrophages require caspase-11 for WT levels of macrophage cell death after 18 h infection with S. flexneri (MOI 50:1; Fig. 4 B; Kayagaki et al., 2015) . Cpb1, C3, and C3aR are also required for WT levels of cell death during S. flexneri infection (Fig. 4 B) . Importantly, the Cpb1, C3, and C3aR phenotypes cannot be explained by defective bacterial uptake (unpublished data).",

This suggests that caspase-11-dependent cell death, during endotoxemia in mice, increases severity of disease and expedites mortality. We have shown here that the Cpb1-C3-C3aR pathway is important for caspase-11 induced gene expression and subsequent caspase-11-dependent cell death in vitro. We hypothesize that the Cpb1-C3-C3aR pathway contributes to the severity of endotoxemia by regulating the expression of proinflammatory mediators, such as caspase-11, in vivo. To interrogate this hypothesis, we established a mouse model in which mice receive an i.p. injection with a sublethal dose of LPS, followed by an i.p. injection of a lethal dose of LPS to induce endotoxemia. Proinflammatory gene expression in blood was measured at 2 h after the sublethal LPS injection. Disease severity was assessed after injection of the lethal LPS injection by measuring body temperature and weight loss every 2-4 h pt (Marshall et al., 2005; Gonnert et al., 2011; Gentile et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "Furthermore, we were interested to know if we could pharmacologically block C3aR activation and decrease the severity of pathologies in mice with endotoxemia. We used a selective nonpeptide antagonist of C3aR (C3aRi; SB290157), shown to be effective in vivo, to block C3aR activation in our mouse model (Ames et al., 2001) . Mice injected with a sublethal dose of LPS and the C3aR inhibitor displayed a reduced level of caspase-11 and il-6 transcripts in the blood compared with mice that were not given the antagonist (Fig. 5 , E and F). After the first injection (6 h), these same mice were injected with a lethal dose of LPS and C3aRi and weight and temperature were recorded to track endotoxemia severity. As seen in the C3aR \u2212/\u2212 mice, mice treated with the C3aRi had significantly less weight loss (Fig. 5 G) . However, the mice treated with C3aRi did not have a difference in temperature loss compared with untreated mice (Fig. 5 H) . Notably, the levels of IL-6 detected in the blood of mice treated with C3aRi were significantly lower than control mice 2 h after injection of low dose LPS (Fig. 5 I) . These data suggest C3aR as a potential therapeutic target for decreasing endotoxemia severity, and highlight a bifurcation in weight loss and temperature loss during sepsis that may be interesting to uncover in future experiments. Finally, we determined whether treatment of mice with C3aRi during endotoxemia could influence survival. We induced endotoxemia in WT mice, with and without C3aRi, and found that mice treated with C3aRi are partially protected from LPS-induced mortality (Fig. 5 J) . Together, these data suggest that C3aR, a key mediator in the Cpb1-C3-C3aR pathway, plays a role in early expression of inflammatory mediators in the blood during endotoxemia and contributes to endotoxemia severity and disease outcome.",

We found that across eight cohorts that matched inclusion criteria (Reghunathan et al., 2005; Ramilo et al., 2007; Chaussabel et al., 2008; Ardura et al., 2009; Ioannidis et al., 2012; Severino et al., 2014; Brand et al., 2015) , the expression of caspase-5 was significantly higher in adults experiencing sepsis verses healthy donors (Fig. 6 E) , suggesting a potential role for caspase-5 in human sepsis. There was no significant change in the expression of caspase-4 in septic patients (unpublished data). Thus, these data find a bifurcation in the induction of caspase-4 and -5 transcripts, highlighting a potential evolutionary divergence in requirement for these caspases during severe sepsis in humans. Notably, we also found that c3aR1 is expressed at significantly higher levels in PBMCs in patients with sepsis ( Fig. 6 E) , suggesting an important role for both caspase-5 and C3aR-signaling in clinical sepsis. Together, these data elucidate the role of C3aR as a mediator of inflammation in primary human macrophages and demonstrated increased expression of C3aR and caspase-5 transcripts in the blood, highlighting the possibility of using these transcripts as diagnostic markers of severe septic patients. Figure 6 . C3aR plays a role in enhanced inflammation in primary human macrophages and is expressed with caspase-5 in PMBCs from patients with sepsis. Primary MDMs were (A) untreated or treated with LPS for 1-3 h, or (B) untreated or treated with C3aRi, with and without LPS stimulation, for 3 h, and protein levels of pro-caspase-4, pro-caspase-5, caspase-5 p20, and \u03b2-actin were evaluated via Western blot. (C) MDMs were untreated or treated with C3aRi, with and without LPS, IFN-\u03b2, or IFN-\u03b3 for 3 h, and levels of phosphorylated p-38 or \u03b2-actin was evaluated via Western blot.

Considering the importance of this cell death pathway in disease severity, we used the CRI SPR-Cas9 genome editing system to create a genome-wide unbiased screen in macrophages to look for unique mediators of caspase-11-dependent cell death. Using this screen, we identified Cpb1 as a novel mediator of caspase-11 expression and subsequent caspase-11-dependent cell death in macrophages (Fig. 1) . Cpb1 is a protein that modifies C3a, an anaphylatoxin product from cleaved complement protein C3, which binds and activates C3aR to modulate immune responses (Takabayashi et al., 1996; Mueller-Ortiz et al., 2006; Leung et al., 2008;  Fig. 7) . Disruption of Cbp1, C3, and C3aR led to a decrease in expression of caspase-11, and other proinflammatory mediators by reducing p38 MAPK activity, downstream of LPS-dependent activation of TLR4 and type-I interferon activation of Ifnar, but not type-II interferon activation of Ifngr signaling (Fig. 1, L-M; Fig. 2; and Fig. 3, A-C) . Interestingly, we show the Cpb1-C3-C3aR pathway amplifies inflammatory responses in both a cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous manner ( Fig. 1-3) . As seen in Cpb1 KO cells, disruption of C3 and C3aR led to a reduction in caspase-11-dependent cell death (Fig. 2, C and F) . Thus, we have elucidated complement as a novel mediator of caspase-11-dependent cell death, through the Cpb1-C3-C3aR signaling pathway.",

We find that Cpb1-C3-C3aR amplification pathway is important for responding to Gram-negative bacterial pathogens by showing the requirement for Cpb1, C3, and C3aR for caspase-11-dependent cell death during S. Typhimurium and S. flexneri infection (Fig. 4, A-C) . Furthermore, in a model of severe endotoxin-induced sepsis, C3aR \u2212/\u2212 mice had lower levels of caspase-11 and il-6 transcripts in the blood and moderate pathologies compared with WT mice (Fig. 5, A-D) . We went on to show that inactivation of C3aR with a small nonpeptide C3aR inhibitor (C3aRi) reduces levels of caspase-11 and il-6 transcripts in the blood, IL-6 cytokines levels in the blood, weight loss during severe sepsis, and increased survival, suggesting C3aR may be a useful therapeutic target for mediating inflammation during the early stages of sepsis which may influence disease outcome (Fig. 5, E-J) . (Lee et al., 1994; Sanc\u00e9au et al., 2000) . C3 expression is induced downstream these pathways (Riches et al., 1988; Maranto et al., 2011) , and is quickly released from macrophages (Goodrum, 1987) , where it is cleaved into C3a and C3b. Anaphylotoxin C3a can be cleaved extracellularly by Cpb1 into C3a-desArg (Leung et al., 2008; Chatterjee et al., 2009) , where it then acts as a ligand for C3aR. We find, the activation of C3aR then amplifies MAPK activity through enhancing p38 MAPK phosphorylation downstream of TLR4 and Ifnar, but not Ifngr, activation. Due to the extracellular nature of this signaling pathway, the Cpb1-C3-C3aR pathway acts as a cell-autonomous and a non-cell autonomous amplification pathway enhancing expression of proinflammatory genes of self-and neighboring macrophages.",

The reduction inflammatory transcripts were reflected in a reduction of proinflammatory cytokine release when cells were treated with C3aRi (Fig. 6 D) . Furthermore, we found, by multicohort gene expression analysis, that a caspase-11 orthologue, caspase-5, and c3aR transcripts are up-regulated in PBMCs in clinical sepsis compared with healthy controls, implicating this signaling pathway in humans experiencing sepsis (Fig. 6 E) . Together, these data demonstrate that the Cpb1-C3-C3aR signaling pathway as an important mediator of caspase-11-dependent cell death, which is important for the response to Gram-negative bacteria and for severity of pathologies during sepsis. Additionally, this pathway may be playing a role in human sepsis.",

Thus, supplementing Cpb1 KO cells with C3 should not be able to complement the Cpb1 KO cell death defect. In agreement with this hypothesis, transfection of recombinant C3 into macrophages during stimulation with intracellular LPS does not rescue the Cpb1 KO cell death phenotype (unpublished data). These preliminary results further suggest that the enzymatic activity of Cpb1 is required for this signaling pathway to amplify caspase-11-dependent cell death during intracellular LPS stimulation.

Increased iNOS can play a very important role in worsening sepsis outcome and may play a role in induction of caspase-11-dependent cell death (Lupfer et al., 2014) . Thus, it is possible that Cpb1 may be contributing to caspase-11dependent cell death via induction of iNOS. However, when we stimulate WT and iNOS-deficient (iNOS \u2212/\u2212 ) BMDMs with intracellular LPS, there is no difference in cell death outcome (unpublished data).

Amplification of TLR signaling by C3aR has been noted previously (Zhang et al., 2007) ; however, this is the first time that C3aR has been described to affect Ifnar signaling, and these data suggest that signaling downstream of this receptor may be more pleotropic than previously presumed. Notably, we find C3aR is modulating p38 MAPK activity downstream of TLR4 and Ifnar, but not Ifngr, activation. Our data suggests that C3aR directly acts on p38 to induce activity, or another protein downstream of TLR and Ifnar, but upstream of p38. It will be interesting to elucidate the mechanism by which C3aR signaling modifies these signaling pathways, and if there other signaling pathways that are affected by C3aR activation during inflammation.",

Primary monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and treated with 30 ng/ml human M-CSF for 6 d. For all assays, 7 d after culture, MDMs were plated at 50,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate and assayed for cytokine release, or plated 1 million cells/well in a 6-well plate and assayed for protein expression level as described above.",

In brief, a systematic search was performed in the National Institutes of Health Gene Expression Omnibus for datasets matching the terms: PBMC, sepsis, SIRS, infection, ICU, bacter[wildcard], acute. We retained clinical datasets that studied severe infections, and excluded datasets that included any ex vivo treatment of cells before microarray profiling, arriving at the final seven datasets (Table S1 ). GSE16129 contained two microarray types, which are treated as two separate cohorts, as previously described (Sweeney et al., 2015) . Fig. S1 showselectropherograms depicting the biallelic mutations for CRI SPR-Cas9 knock-out RAW cell lines Cpb1KO, C3aRKO, and C3KO. Fig. S2 shows alignments of caspase-11 genes. Table S1 is a list of the top 100 enriched hits in the CRI SPR-Cas9 screen. Table S2 lists the gRNAs for each CRI SPR-Cas9 knock-out cell line. Table S3 lists the sequences for each set of primers used in qRT-PCR. Table S4 provides information on the cohorts used in our multi-cohort analysis.",
