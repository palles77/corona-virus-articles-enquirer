The synthesized nanoparticles were tested for long-term storage to confirm the stability of their thermal decomposition process. Then, an integrated microfluidic system was developed to perform the diagnosis process automatically, including virus purification and detection. To apply these nanoparticles for influenza diagnosis, a micromixer was optimized to reduce the dead volume within the microfluidic chip. Furthermore, the mixing index of the micromixer could achieve as high as 97% in 2 seconds. The optical signals showed that this nanoparticle-based immunoassay with dynamic mixing could successfully achieve a detection limit of influenza as low as 0.007 HAU. When compared with the 4.5-\u03bcm magnetic beads, the optical signals of the MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles were twice as sensitive. Furthermore, five clinical specimens were tested to verify the usability of the developed system.",

The Hong Kong Flu in 1968 and the Bird Flu in 2004 also caused numerous deaths worldwide. The Swine Flu outbreak in June 2009 in Mexico caused serious concern because of the hydride genome of that virus. 4, 5 Therefore, the capability to detect influenza infections rapidly and provide immediate and appropriate clinical treatment is an important need that needs to be addressed.",

However, they are labor-intensive processes performed by well-trained personnel, and also require a substantial amount of bench-top equipment. Recently, with the development of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technologies, an increasing number of miniature biomedical systems have demonstrated the potential for virus detection. For instance, a nano-cantilever beam operating as a mass detector was developed for the detection of viral particle 9 ; this type of microsystem was further used for virus-specific antibodies to selectively detect pathogens. 10, 11 However, sample pre-treatment and virus purification are still challenging to achieve in the cantilever beam sensing system.",

Specific antibodies were coated on beads, which enabled the specific isolation and collection of target cells or viruses by using a magnetic force. 14 For instance, microfluidic systems demonstrating the capability of executing separations and detection of DNA fragments with small amounts of reagents in a single microfluidic device were achieved. 15, 16 Rapid viral detection has also been demonstrated by several research groups. 17, 18 For example, a microfluidic device with bead-based viral purification and on-chip reverse transcriptase PCR capabilities was applied to specifically detect dengue virus and enterovirus 71. 17 An integrated micro-flow cytometry using the bead-based immunoassay approach has demonstrated automatic detection of the dengue virus down to a concentration of 10 3 PFU/mL in 40 min. 18 Yet another integrated microfluidic system has achieved rapid detection in as little as 15 min which has been realized while using clinical specimens. 19, 20 However, the magnetic beads used in previous studies are approximately 4.5 \u03bcm in diameter, which is much bigger than the influenza virus (approximately 100 nm in diameter). The incomparable size between beads and viruses can affect the detection signal and cause relatively high background noise. Using beads with smaller sizes and larger surface area may be beneficial for target detection.",

            "text": "With the advancement of nanotechnology, numerous nanomaterials have been developed for their unique properties. For instance, fullerenes and carbon nanotubes show high heat conductivity, electrical conductivity, and relative low chemical activity. They have even been used for medical studies associated with bacteria, viruses, and cancer cells. [21] [22] [23] Nanoparticles have also been developed for detecting avian flu in red blood cells 24 or alpha-fetoprotein in serum 25 because of their uniform distribution, long-term stability and bio-compatibility. Among them, magnetic nanoparticles have been applied in molecular imaging because of their outstanding magnetic-spin structures such that they could enhance magnetic resonance imaging. [26] [27] [28] Moreover, magnetic nanoparticles have advantages including multiplexing, reduced analysis time and selectivity control. Furthermore, with the development of microfluidic systems, magnetic nanoparticles have been used for immunoassay applications that involved a simple microfluidic chip. However, only immunoglobulin G was used as a test model and no disease detection was demonstrated. 29 For instance, superparamagnetic nanoparticles have been used to capture pathogenic microorganisms or nanometer-size particles, such as virions. 30, 31 Immunoglobulin E detection in diagnosing allergies is another application of magnetic nanoparticles. 32 The high capture rate, throughput, and sample pre-concentration, as compared with the traditional assay, have been demonstrated. 33 In this study, it is the first attempt to apply nanoparticles, by using an integrated microfluidic system that involves characterized micro-devices working with magnetic MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles for influenza detection with a FIA. By using this approach, the detection limit of the diagnosis is expected to improve because of the large surface-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles. These wellproduced stable magnetic MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles are further combined with a layer-by-layer (LBL) surface modification process to reduce the background noise due to non-specific adhesion of nanoparticles. An integrated microfluidics system for detection of influenza infectious in 20 min has been demonstrated and may be promising for rapid diagnosis in the near future.",

Virus with different concentrations in serial four-time dilutions (8.0, 2.0, 0.50, 0.125, 0.031, and 0.007 HAU, respectively) were tested. Note that the entire process can be performed within 20 min. Compared with a 1 \u00d7 PBS buffer as a negative control (NC) (Figures 6, A-G) , the optical signals for the detection of influenza virus in the microfluidic system with different viral concentrations were shown. The optical signals for samples with concentrations of 8.0, 2.0, 0.50, 0.125, 0.031, 0.007 HAU and NC were measured to be 2500, 2500, 2032 \u00b1 279, 1449 \u00b1 183, 860 \u00b1 135, 557 \u00b1 88, and 440 \u00b1 39 mV (n = 3), respectively. Note that the maximum optical signal of the PMT was 2500 mV. Therefore, the first two cases were saturated signals. The merged images also showed that the PE fluorescence was located in the magnetic nanoparticles. Therefore, influenza virus A could be successfully detected with this approach. The limit of detection was then determined to be 0.007 HAU. Figure 6 , H compares the limit of detection between the M450 magnetic beads and the magnetic nanoparticles. The detected optical signals with M450 beads for 8.0, 2.0, 0.50, 0.125, 0.031, 0.007 HAU and NC were 2198 \u00b1 233, 1199 \u00b1 155, 774 \u00b1 52, 531 \u00b1 37, 462 \u00b1 29, 390 \u00b1 22, and 368 \u00b1 15 mV (n = 3), respectively. By using the magnetic nanoparticles, the optical signals were approximately two times stronger than those from the M450 magnetic beads. This indicates that the proposed new system can successfully detect the influenza infection with a higher sensitivity. Furthermore, two negative samples (specimens 1 and 2) and three positive samples (specimens 3, 4 and 5) were applied for pre-clinical test in order to verify the developed microfluidic system. The optical signal for pre-clinical test of specimens 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were measured to be 1225 \u00b1 191, 1140 \u00b1 212, 2295 \u00b1 120, 2500 and 1964 \u00b1 258 mV (n = 3), respectively. The pre-clinical testing fluorescence images with nanoparticles were shown in Figure 6 , I and the error bars of the signal from the nanoparticles were shown in Figure 6 , J. These results show that the developed microfluidic system can distinguish the difference between the negative specimens and positive clinical specimens and further statistical analysis was shown in SI section IX.",

This process consisted of the size-control Fe 3-\u03b4 O 4 and the shapephase-control M-Fe-O nanoparticles production methods. 36, 37 However, only approximately 20-nm nanoparticles were produced in the previous studies, thus increasing the required rounds of thermal decomposition of the MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles to grow to approximately 100 nm. By using different synthesis temperatures (150, 270, and 305\u00b0C), the manual operation steps were relatively safer and the shape and size of nanoparticles could be further controlled effectively. While these 100-nm nanoparticles were detected under the UV-Vis spectrum, the UV absorbance range showed specific features of approximately 300~350 nm, which enables perceiving the color of the MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles involved. Note that they were different from the MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles obtained by using another production process, which showed a green color. 40 XDR peaks showed the crystal phase pattern of the MnFe 2 O 4 . Compared with the standard MnFe 2 O 4 pattern of JCPDS (10-0319), non-typical peaks were detected at 331, 531, and 444. 41 However, further comparisons with JCPDS patterns of 73-1964, 74-2403, 75-0034, and 88-1965 showed other XRD patterns of MnFe 2 O 4 with slight differences in the formation ratios of Mn and Fe.

            "text": "Another unique feature of this study involved successfully applying the appropriate PDMS surface modification methods for the MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles. The final nanoparticles hydrophilic process caused them to carry a positive charge, thereby showing non-specific adhesion in the micromixer chamber. It even caused a high background signal of approximately 708 mV, as shown in Supplemental Figure 2 . Subsequently, P123, PAA, and PEI were applied, and the PDMS surface modification method also produced a positive charge in the micromixer chamber. By applying this LBL self-assembly structure, these nanoparticles can mix well in the micromixer and lower the background noise to 440 mV. The findings of this research provide a new approach for nanoparticle application of dynamic mixing in a microfluidic system. Many types of surface modification methods should be adapted for different nanoparticles from different synthesis processes. Other PDMS surface modification methods should also demonstrate their function after further testing and produce stronger dynamic nanoparticle mixing signals and lower background noise. 46, 47 On average, the nanoparticles signal was twice stronger than that of the M450 micro-beads. To compare the signals between the M450 beads and the MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles, the similar weight of beads/nanoparticles (approximately 6.1 \u03bcg per reaction) coated with \u03b1-A-NP mAbs (5 \u03bcg, as shown in section 2.4) were used. The difference in diameter between the two types of particles (4.5 \u03bcm for M450 beads versus 100 nm for nanoparticles) results in a difference of 2025 times in their surface areas. However, the number of applied M450 beads was totally 8.0 \u00d7 10 4 , which was much less than the number of MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles of the same weight (totally 2.2 \u00d7 10 9 ). These predicted results indicate that the nanoparticles contain approximately 10 times the reaction surface area of the M450 beads (1 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 10 9 : 2025 \u00d7 8.0 \u00d7 10 4 \u2248 10:1). Therefore, there are two aspects of this research requiring further discussion. First, the collection of magnetic nanoparticles should be performed by comparing it with previous work on M450 beads. 19, 20 Although the fluorescence signals were located in the nanoparticles, as the merged images shown in Figures 6, A-G , the nanoparticles may not be completely focused for better signals. Second, the error bar of the signal from the nanoparticles shown in Figure 6 , H is higher than M450, and the background noise of 1 \u00d7 PBS control is also higher than the error bar of M450. Effective focusing and collection are the next concerns for applying dynamically mixed nanoparticles and combining dielectrophoresis; otherwise the AC electro-osmosis force may provide the additional force for nanoparticle collection. 48, 49 In addition, a well-designed customer-made control system, which was composed of a temperature control module, an air compressor, several EMVs, and an optical detection module, might also reduce optical signal loss and automatically perform the entire diagnostic process. 50 Note that in this study only the limited number of clinical samples was applied and a much greater number of samples should need to be tested to fully validates this system for medical diagnosis in the near future.",
