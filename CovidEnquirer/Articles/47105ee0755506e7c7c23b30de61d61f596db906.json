            "text": "Scuba divers depend on air in the form of compressed air from a tank, transmitted to the mouth by way of a regulator held in the mouth by the teeth, so that there is an airtight seal between the teeth and lips. Inability to hold the mouthpiece because of missing teeth poses a contraindication to scuba diving. Dental concerns in divers include temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and muscle pain from holding the regulator ('diver's mouth syndrome'), barotrauma and barodontalgia (from the effects of pressure changes), and the management of prostheses. Many divers experience TMJ and/or facial muscle pain or headache from the continuous jaw clenching. Mouthpieces are usually made of neoprene or silicone rubber and are held in place by bite tabs that fit into the dentition at the canine and premolar area. The average dive lasts 30-60 minutes and requires constant jaw muscle effort. Extending the bite tabs to cover the molar teeth balances the weight of the regulator and can relieve stress on the TMJ. Barodontalgia (pain in the tooth caused by pressure changes) can arise in divers (or people in aircraft or at high altitude) if there are pulp lesions, abscesses or sinusitis. Antral pain may have a similar cause. Teeth that have been opened for endodontic treatment and temporarily sealed have been known to explode from air trapping and expansion on surfacing -mainly in deep divers using a helium-oxygen mixture. Full porcelain crowns can also shatter from relatively shallow dives of 65 feet. Raised pressure in the middle ear can occasionally cause facial palsy (baroparesis) but this typically resolves spontaneously over a few hours.",

Athletes (and others) may misuse anabolic (androgenic) steroids (AAS) -synthetic substances related to male sex hormones -to enhance performance (and also to improve physical appearance); these are taken orally or injected, typically in cycles of weeks or months ('cycling'), rather than continuously. There are two types of AAS: Due to the enhancement of testing procedures in the detection of anabolic steroids, 'designer steroids' such as tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) have been developed. THG breaks down during the preparation Anabolic steroids given to adolescents may accelerate pubertal changes and cause premature skeletal maturation, halting growth. The major toxic effects include kidney and liver tumours (and jaundice), fluid retention and hypertension, increases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), severe acne, trembling, hostility and aggression, and other psychiatric effects. Gender-specific adverse effects include: for men -testicular atrophy, low sperm count, infertility, baldness, breast development and prostate cancer; and for women -facial hair growth, baldness, menstrual changes, clitoris enlargement and deepened voice.
