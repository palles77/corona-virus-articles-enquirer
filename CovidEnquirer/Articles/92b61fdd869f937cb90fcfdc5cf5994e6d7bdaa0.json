            "text": "This trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSv) on a subsequent challenge with Pasteurella multocidu in pigs. Sixteen, 3-4 week-old piglets, from a PRRSv and Aujeszky disease virus (ADV) free herd were used. Animals were equally and randomly allocated in four groups which were treated according the following schedule: Group I: negative controls; Group II: inoculation with only PRRSV; Group III: inoculation with PRRSV and P. multocida; Group IV: inoculation with ADV and P. multocidu (positive controls). PRRSV and ADV were inoculated intranasally, at the doses of 104.'j and 1O'.5 TCIDSO/ml, respectively. Five days later, pigs from groups III and IV were inoculated intranasally, with two ml of a IO9 CFU/ml suspension of equal parts of P. multocidu, strains A52 and A24. No lesions were observed in piglets of group I. Microscopically, interstitial pneumonia was identified in all piglets of groups II and III and 3/4 piglets from group IV. Bronchopneumonia was detected in 3/4 of the piglets from group III and in all animals of group IV which, additionally, showed meningo-encephalitis and purulent rhinitis. Macroscopically, only piglets of groups III and IV had lung consolidation. However, much lower pneumonic scores (2.3%) were observed in group III, where 3 of 4 piglets were affected. On the other hand, all piglets of group IV showed some degree of pulmonary consolidation, with a mean score of 13.7%. Based on these results, it appears that the role of PRRSV as a initiator of secondary diseases is still undefined, but is probably mild. There was no clear interaction between PRRSv and Pasteurella multocida under the conditions and strains tested here. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

They were used as a positive control, based on previous reports (Fuentes and Pijoan, 1987) that have shown that ADV inoculation. followed by P. multocida, results in macroscopic pulmonary consolidation. A group of pigs inoculated with P. multocida alone was not used since the disease could not be reproduced without the presence of a predisposing agent. Table 1 shows, schematically, the inoculating schedule employed. Clinical evaluations were performed daily, in all groups. Following the experimental period, all animals were euthanized with an intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital and necropsy was then performed. Histopathologic studies included samples from lungs, nasal turbinates, trachea. brain, kidneys, liver, spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, intestines and heart. Nasal swabs, tracheal swabs and lung samples were collected for microbiological studies. These were done by inoculating samples into brain heart infusion media, supplied with bacitracin (5 pg/ml) and lincomycin (5 pg/ml). Tracheal and lung samples were also cultured directly onto 5% sheep blood agar. Cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight.",
