            "text": "Background: Oxygen exists in two gaseous and six solid allotropic modifications. An additional allotropic modification of oxygen, the cyclooctaoxygen, was predicted to exist in 1990. Methods: Cyclooctaoxygen sodium was synthesized in vitro from atmospheric oxygen, or catalase effectgenerated oxygen, under catalysis of cytosine nucleosides and either ninhydrin or eukaryotic low-molecular weight RNA. Thin-layer chromatographic mobility shift assays were applied on specific nucleic acids and the cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex. Results: We report the first synthesis and characterization of cyclooctaoxygen as its sodium crown complex, isolated in the form of three cytosine nucleoside hydrochloride complexes. The cationic cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex is shown to bind to nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), to associate with single-stranded DNA and spermine phosphate, and to be essentially non-toxic to cultured mammalian cells at 0.1-1.0 mM concentration. Conclusions: We postulate that cyclooctaoxygen is formed in most eukaryotic cells in vivo from dihydrogen peroxide in a catalase reaction catalyzed by cytidine and RNA. A molecular biological model is deduced for a first epigenetic shell of eukaryotic in vivo DNA. This model incorporates an epigenetic explanation for the interactions of the essential micronutrient selenium (as selenite) with eukaryotic in vivo DNA. General significance: Since the sperminium phosphate/cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex is calculated to cover the active regions (2.6%) of bovine lymphocyte interphase genome, and 12.4% of murine enterocyte mitotic chromatin, we propose that the sperminium phosphate/cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex coverage of nucleic acids is essential to eukaryotic gene regulation and promoted proto-eukaryotic evolution.",

The \u03b3-, \u03b2-, and \u03b1-phases exist at ambient pressure (p = 101.325 kPa) and low temperature (\u03b3 at T b 54.4 K; \u03b2 at T b 43.8 K; \u03b1 at T b 23.8 K) [1, 2] . At ambient temperature (T = 295 K) under pressure of 5.4 GPa, oxygen solidifies into the \u03b2-phase, then at 9.6 GPa into the orthorhombic 'orange' \u03b4-phase, and, successively, at 10 GPa into the monoclinic 'dark red' \u03b5-phase. Above 96 GPa \u03b5-oxygen is transformed into the metallic \u03b6-phase which exhibits superconductivity (T c = 0.6 K) [1, 2] . The 'red' \u03b5-phase revealed the structure of two combined tetroxetane (cyclo-O 4 ) rings, giving rise to rhombohedral O 8 clusters [2] . In 1990, a ninth allotropic modification of oxygen was theoretically predicted [3] , the cyclooctaoxygen (cyclo-O 8 , octoxocane) ( Fig. 1A) [1, 3] , assumed to exist in analogy to the common modification of elemental sulfur, cyclooctasulfur (cyclo-S 8 , octathiocane) [3] . We now wish to report the (biomimetic) synthesis, isolation, chemical characterization, biochemical and epigenetic significance of cyclo-O 8 in the form of its sodium crown complex, (octoxocane-\u03ba 4 O 1 ,O 3 ,O 5 ,O 7 )sodium(1 +) or cyclo-O 8 -Na + (Fig. 1B) , which can be liganded to give aqua(chloro)(octoxocane-\u03ba 4 O 1 ,O 3 ,O 5 ,O 7 )sodium (Fig. 1C ).

The FT-Raman spectroscopy experiments were recorded neat on a Bruker FT-Raman spectrometer RFS 100/S (Bruker Optics GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). The Raman excitation source was a Nd:YAG-laser (\u03bb = 1064 nm). Given FT-IR absorbance and FT-Raman emission bands, both expressed in wavenumbers \u1e7d (cm \u22121 ), are characterized in intensity as strong (str), middle (m), weak (w), and broad (br).

The evolved first yield (9.927 g) of the crystalline, white product was filtered and dried over CaCl 2 in vacuo. Acetone (600 ml) was added to the filtrate, and it was frozen at \u2212 25\u00b0C for 18 h. The evolved second yield (266 mg) of the product was filtered and dried over CaCl 2 in vacuo. The filtrate was frozen at \u2212 25\u00b0C for 28 h. The evolved third yield (217 mg) of the product was filtered and dried over CaCl 2 in vacuo.

Each dilution of test or control compound was added to 5 wells of a 96-well plate, and three wells of each dilution were then infected with the test virus. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was \u22640.007 cell culture infective dose 50% (CCID 50 )/cell for each virus. Two wells remained uninfected as toxicity controls. Six wells per plate were set aside as uninfected, untreated cell controls, and six wells per plate were infected with no treatment as virus controls. A known active compound was assayed in parallel as a control. The test medium was MEM with 2% FBS for chikungunya virus and MERS coronavirus, and MEM with 1 IU/ml trypsin and 10 \u03bcg/ml of EDTA for influenza A viruses. Assay plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 .

The unincorporated neutral red solution was removed from the wells and the incorporated dye was then eluted by adding S\u00f8rensen citrate-buffered ethanol. The plates were then read on a spectrophotometer at \u03bb = 540 nm wavelength to quantify the neutral red taken up by the healthy cells. The optical density of test wells was converted to percent of cell control and normalized to the virus controls. The concentration of test compound required to inhibit CPE by 50% (EC 50 ) was calculated by regression analysis. The concentration of compound that would cause 50% CPE in the absence of virus (CC 50 ) was also calculated by regression analysis using the uninfected wells treated with test compounds compared with untreated cell controls.

Plates were incubated as noted above until viral CPE reached its endpoint, then each well was scored microscopically for the presence of viral CPE. The virus titer was determined based on the endpoint using the Reed-Muench method [31] . Test wells were compared with virus control wells, and the concentration of compound required to reduce virus yield by 90% or 1 log 10 (EC 90 ) was calculated by regression analysis. Assays were conducted in (at least) triplicate, and the arithmetic mean values \u00b1 standard deviation (s.d.) were calculated.",

            "text": "In an endeavor to gain new antiviral substances, the reported reaction [32] of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) nucleoside cytidine with ninhydrin on reflux was re-examined. Instead of cytidine, cytidine hydrochloride (cytidine \u00d7 HCl) was utilized ( Fig. 2A) . The reported reaction [32] did not proceed, instead a crystalline material NC could be isolated which gave not the elemental analysis of cytidine \u00d7 HCl. This striking difference of NC from cytidine \u00d7 HCl was examined further by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S1 ), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Fig. S2) , FT-Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S3) , and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) ( Fig. S4A and Fig. S5 ). It could be substantiated that NC contained an inert material not being salt (NaCl), since the FT-IR spectrum of NC differed from that of cytidine \u00d7 HCl. According to elemental analysis this inert material could account for one O 2 and a quarter of NaCl pro one cytidine \u00d7 HCl. In consequence, the formula was multiplied fourfold and this resulted in an oxygen 8-ring, cyclo-O 8 (Fig. 1A) , coordinated to one Na + (Fig. 1B) . The interpretation of the ESI-MS spectrum of NC actually proved the inclusion of cyclo-O 8 -Na + in NC, revealing was the detection of the aqua(octoxocane-\u03ba 4 O 1 ,O 3 ,O 5 ,O 7 )sodium(1 +) cation (Fig. S5) . Since in the 1 H-NMR spectrum of NC, in comparison to the 1 H-NMR reference spectrum of cytidine \u00d7 HCl, the differentially affected resonances were the 4-NH 2 , the 3-NH + , and the H-5 protons of the protonated cytidine (Fig. S1) , it is assumed that the points of coordination between cyclo-O 8 -Na + and cytidine \u00d7 HCl are the two 4-NH 2 hydrogens and one non-Na + -coordinated (free) oxygen of cyclo-O 8 -Na + . Consequently, a formula for NC can be elaborated: cytidine hydrochloride \u2212 aqua(chloro)(octoxocane-\u03ba 4 O 1 ,O 3 ,O 5 ,O 7 )sodium (4:1) (Fig. 2A) . The FT-Raman spectrum of NC (Fig. S3B) was nearly identical to the reference spectrum of cytidine \u00d7 HCl (Fig. S3A) . This, contrary to expectation, pointed to Raman-inactivity of cyclo-O 8 -Na + .",

Our interest concentrated on oxygen formation by possible catalase effects under physiological conditions. The catalase effect is the disproportionation of dihydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) into oxygen and water: 2 H 2 O 2 \u2192 O 2 + 2 H 2 O. As a catalyst RNA was selected, since RNA can exhibit enzymatic (ribozyme) activities in vivo [33] . The selected RNA was Candida utilis anamorph yeast low-molecular weight RNA. This RNA consists of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and the C. utilis 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [34, 35] . As a result, it was discovered that NC catalyzed oxygen formation from H 2 O 2 (catalase effect) [11] weakly in presence of NaHCO 3 , and strongly in presence of both C. utilis RNA and NaHCO 3 (Fig. S9) . Interestingly, NC could be fully substituted by cytidine \u00d7 HCl. Multiple controls assured that oxygen neither was produced spontaneously, nor from any other relevant combination of the utilized reagents. Taken together, the nucleoside cytidine, not cyclo-O 8 -Na + , was responsible for the catalase activity expressed in presence of H 2 O 2 and C. utilis RNA under biomimetic conditions.",

For this purpose, thin-layer chromatographic mobility shift assays [37] were applied on specific nucleic acids and the cyclo-O 8 -Na + contained in NC. Firstly, the affinity of the cyclo-O 8 -Na + toward C. utilis low-molecular weight RNA was investigated (Fig. S12) . It was found that the cyclo-O 8 -Na + contained in NC retained the chromatographic shift of C. utilis 5S rRNA, but not the chromatographic shift of C. utilis tRNAs. Interestingly, since work conditions were not human skin ribonuclease (RNase)-free, the RNase A digestion products of C. utilis 5S rRNA were separated chromatographically (Fig. S12) . These dinucleotide 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphates (products of RNase A digestion) [38] result from human skin RNase 7 [39] -mediated digestion of C. utilis 5S rRNA. The structures of these dinucleotides can be deduced [34, 35] , since RNase 7 belongs to the RNase A superfamily [39] . The cyclo-O 8 -Na + contained in NC bound strongly to these dinucleotide 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphates, since their chromatographic shifts were significantly retarded. Controls were included to differentiate the sole binding of cytidine \u00d7 HCl to the RNA targets by Watson-Crick base pairing [40] from the indicative cyclo-O 8 -Na + plus cytidine \u00d7 HCl binding to the RNA targets.",

NC and dNC were non-toxic to PBM cells, but stimulated the growth of CCRF-CEM cells. This pointed to a catalase effect exerted by NC and dNC, since CCRF-CEM cells are extremely sensitive to H 2 O 2 [43] , and scavenging of H 2 O 2 by 'catalase factors' is CCRF-CEM cell growth rate-limiting [43, 44] . Since NC was more active as a growth stimulant for CCRF-CEM cells than dNC, the responsible 'catalase factors' should be the nucleoside hydrochlorides, not the equimolar cyclo-O 8 -Na + -content in NC and dNC. NC and dNC exhibited no significant in vitro antiviral activities against the retro-transcribing human immunodeficiency type 1 and hepatitis B viruses (HIV-1 and HBV) ( Table S1 ). NC showed no significant in vitro inhibiting activity versus the replication of influenza A, chikungunya, and Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses (Table S2 ). In summary, cyclo-O 8 -Na + is, contrary to expectation, essentially non-toxic to human cells, and cytidine in conjunction with RNA acts as a catalyst in producing cyclo-O 8 -Na + from ubiquitous [45] H 2 O 2 through a catalase reaction in cultured human cells.",

We suggest a model for a first epigenetic shell of in vivo DNA (Fig. 4) , based on the observed complexation of cyclo-O 8 -Na + and spermine phosphate to ssDNA. One reason why this protecting shield of in vivo DNA was overlooked until now may be its destruction during DNA purification by the classical phenol extraction method of Schuster, Schramm, and Zillig [47] . In our model (Fig. 4A) , the phosphate backbone of ssDNA binds one cyclo-O 8 -Na + pro three nucleotides, and this binary complex binds one spermine monophosphate to form a ternary epigenetic core of DNA. The monohydrogen phosphate bridges the cyclo-O 8 -Na + with the sperminium cation, and the cyclo-O 8 -Na + has an inverted alternating orientation (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, the sperminium tetracation cannot bind alone to DNA in this model, since the distances [d (N 1 ,N 4 ) = 490 pm; d (N 1 ,N 12 ) = 1600 pm] between the four ammonium nitrogens do not fit the average repeating distance (d \u00d8 = 650 \u00b1 30 pm) of the phosphate anion charges of DNA. Therefore, it is quite remarkable that in our model for the first epigenetic shell of in vivo DNA (Fig. 4A ) a repeating unit is formed from cyclo-O 8 -Na + and spermine phosphate that perfectly fits both the triplet nature of the genetic code [48] and the repeating distance of the phosphate anion backbone of DNA.",

The theoretical intracellular concentration of the sperminium phosphate/ cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex required to cover all triplets of the dsDNA genome in a blood lymphocyte of Bos taurus was calculated as 13.8130 mM (see Section 2.9). The actual concentration of spermine was measured as 1.57 \u00b1 0.12 (mM \u00b1 s.d.) [15] . Therefore, the coverage of B. taurus genome can be calculated as 2.62 \u00b1 0.50 (% \u00b1 s.d.) (see Section 2.9). A correlation was obtained when this value was compared to the proportion of protein-coding exons in B. taurus genome which was calculated as 2.64% or 2.68% by two independent methods (see Section 2.9). This points to complete coverage of actively transcribed gene regions in B. taurus interphase genome by the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex. Since spermine binds more strongly to GC-rich dsDNA (pBR322 plasmid) [15] , it can be assumed that the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex binds preferentially to epigenetic, non-methylated CpG island hotspots [49] and is involved in epigenetic gene regulation [49] .",

The content of spermine in HeLa S3 cell metaphase chromatin was calculated as 135.9 \u00b1 16.1 pmol spermine/ 82.84 zmol dsDNA (see Section 2.10). This corresponds to 1.64 \u00d7 10 9 molecules spermine (and, hence, of sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + ) pro one HeLa S3 cell diploid genome, corresponding to a haploid genomic coverage of 12.6%. This is a reasonable result, since spermine synthesis is highest in the metaphase of mitosis in the cell cycle, coincident with an extraordinary high condensation grade of metaphase chromatin [50] . Control for this in vitro result is the published elemental phosphorus content (mmol/kg dry weight) in mitotic chromatin of primary cryptal enterocytes of murine duodenum [21] . The obtained in vivo value corresponds to a haploid genomic coverage of 12.4%, and a nuclear RNA coverage of 77.3%, by the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex in mitotic chromatin (see Section 2.11) . This points to a function of sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + occupation for nuclear RNA.",

Selenium is essential to mammalian physiology at nutritional levels, but supraphysiological intake of selenium is known to be toxic for mammals [51] [52] [53] . Selenium has the ability to protect DNA from noxious influences (oxidative stress, radiation, cytotoxic agents) [51] and is essential to genomic stability [52] , but the exact molecular biological basis for these phenomena is unknown. If in our model of a first epigenetic shell of in vivo DNA (Fig. 4A ) the monohydrogen phosphate is replaced by hydrogen selenite (Fig. 4B) , an epigenetic explanation for the interaction of selenium with eukaryotic in vivo DNA could be given. This model may account for, at least some of, the well-known bimodal, protective and toxic, in vivo effects exerted by selenium onto mammalian physiology [51] [52] [53] . A moderate substitution pattern of hydrogen selenite for monohydrogen phosphate would be essential, but if the displacement ratio HSeO 3 \u2212 /HPO 4 2\u2212 exceeds a certain tolerance level, the epigenetic equilibrium could collapse.",

These postulations would account for a long-sought molecular explanation of the essential, but 'mysterious' function of the polyamine spermine in eukaryotes [55] . Spermine is found only in eukaryotes, with some exceptions, and prokaryotes rely mostly on putrescine and spermidine [55, 56] . The essentiality of spermine for humans is exemplified by the Snyder-Robinson X-linked mental retardation syndrome [57] caused by missense mutations in the human spermine synthase gene, leading to mental retardation, generalized seizures, absent speech, inability to stand, and other severe defects [57] . One can speculate that at the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life, the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex resulted as a consequence from the combined accumulation of atmospheric oxygen and prokaryotic RNA, since the evolution of spermine synthases from prokaryotic spermidine synthase was proposed [56] as co-occurring with the onset of protoeukaryotic life.",
