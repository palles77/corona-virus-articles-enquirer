            "text": "There are a variety of non-molecular approaches for respiratory virus detection, including rapid antigen testing, immunofluorescence (IF) antibody testing, conventional cell culture, and rapid cell culture. Specimens tested include nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirates, NP washes, NP swabs, NP swabs plus oropharyngeal (OP) swabs in viral transport media (VTM), and liquid specimens, such as sputum, tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages. The sensitivity of virus detection for each method can vary significantly and is dependent on the sample type, time of sample collection after onset of symptoms, patient age, antigen target and properties of the virus. For example, direct detection and recovery of most respiratory viruses is better when NP aspirates are tested when compared to NP or OP swabs . Influenza B tends to be present in lower amounts than influenza A and children generally shed higher titers of virus and for longer time periods than adults. The methodologies, costs, advantages and disadvantages of each non-molecular test method are described in detail in a review by Leland and Ginocchio (2007) and are summarized in Table 1. immunoassays (OIAs) (Thermo Electron Corp., Boulder, CO) and the immunochromatographiclateral flow (ICLF) systems. These techniques provide the most rapid results, generally within 15\u221230 min. They are simple to use; many have waived status according to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) guidelines and can be performed outside the laboratory setting, in emergency departments, clinics, and physician offices. Many assays contain an internal control to monitor reagent and technical performance, and some can detect and differentiate influenza A and B. A major disadvantage is that testing is limited to influenza A, B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).",

            "text": "Generally, EIAs, OIAs and ICLFs require approximately 10 5 \u221210 6 viral particles to obtain a positive result. This is in contrast to cell culture and molecular amplification assays that may only require as few as 10 virus particles, or 2\u22125 RNA or DNA targets, respectively, for virus detection (St. George et al., 2002) . Numerous studies have demonstrated that the sensitivities of the assays vary significantly and range from 44% to 95% for influenza and 59% to 89% for RSV, as compared to cell culture (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007) . Results vary due to study design, properties of the assay, patient population and comparator test method and caution should be used in the interpretation and comparison of study results. The sensitivity of non-IF RSV antigen tests is higher than that of non-IF antigen tests for influenza A and B and is generally higher than that of cell culture due to the lability of RSV. During the respiratory season, assay specificity for RSV and influenza non-IF antigen tests is high, 93-100% and 74-100%, respectively (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007; WHO, 2005) . However, the specificity and positive predictive value of non-IF antigen tests are markedly reduced when (1) Shorter time to detection as compared to conventional culture (2) Detect viruses that replicate poorly in cell culture (3) Requires less expertise than reading CPE",

During this time period, non-IF antigen tests should be used with caution, and positive results should be confirmed by DFA, cell culture, or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (WHO, 2005) . It is also good laboratory practice to confirm the first few \"seasonal\" positive results using another method, preferably viral culture. Supplemental testing should also be considered when a viral isolate is necessary for epidemiology studies, antiviral testing or to rule out co-infection with another virus, particularly in persons with underlying disease, immune suppression, and severe respiratory disease. Finally, the laboratory should reevaluate the performance of their non-IF rapid test on a yearly basis, as circulating viral strains may change that can affect the sensitivity and specificity of their assay.",

IF testing can also be done as a reflex test for specimens negative by the non-IF antigen tests or for those positive by a non-IF antigen test, if there is a potential for a mixed infection. Individual FMAbs for the 7 respiratory viruses are also available from the above manufacturers. Compared to viral culture, the overall sensitivity of the FMAb pools has been reported as approximately 81% (Leland, 1996) and can vary significantly depending on the virus.

With the exception of RSV and adenovirus, most studies have demonstrated equal or enhanced detection of the other common respiratory viruses using R-Mix TM as compared to non-molecular based methods (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007) . R-Mix TM cells have been shown to support the growth of viruses that are not typically isolated in cell cultures, including hMPV (Setterquist and Grey, 2003; Lotlikar et al., 2007b) and the SARS coronavirus (Gillim-Ross et al., 2004) . R-Mix Too cells (DHI), comprised of Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and A549 cells, do not support the growth of SARS CoV (Gillim-Ross et al., 2004) or other coronaviruses but are very sensitive for isolation of respiratory viruses (Wilkey et al., 2006) . R-Mix TM and R-Mix Too cultures should support the growth of the avian influenza strains (de Jong and Hien, 2006) . One of the major benefits of using rapid culture versus conventional culture methods is the significant improvement in time to positive results, 1.4 d versus 5.2 d (Barenfanger et al., 2001) and 48 hr for 95% positives versus 6 days for 98% positives (Fong et al., 2000) .",
