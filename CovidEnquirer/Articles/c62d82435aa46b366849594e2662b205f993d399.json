            "text": "Sera from 38 free-ranging spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, were screened for exposure to coronavirus of antigenic group 1. An immunofluorescence assay indicated high levels of exposure to coronavirus among Serengeti hyenas: 95% when considering sera with titer levels of \u22651:10 and 74% when considering sera with titer levels of \u22651:40. Cubs had generally lower mean titer levels than adults. Exposure among Serengeti hyenas to coronavirus was also confirmed by a serum neutralisation assay and an ELISA. Application of RT-PCR to 27 fecal samples revealed viral RNA in three samples (11%). All three positive fecal samples were from the 15 juvenile animals (<24 months of age) sampled, and none from the 12 adults sampled. No viral RNA was detected in tissue samples (lymph node, intestine, lung) from 11 individuals. Sequencing of two amplified products from the S protein gene of a positive sample revealed the presence of coronavirus specific RNA with a sequence homology to canine coronavirus of 76 and 78% and to feline coronavirus type II of 80 and 84%, respectively. Estimation of the phylogenetic relationship among coronavirus isolates indicated considerable divergence of the hyena variant from those in European, American and Japanese domestic cats and dogs. From long-term observations of several hundred known individuals, the only clinical sign in hyenas consistent with those described for coronavirus infections in dogs and cats was diarrhea. There was no evidence that coronavirus infection in hyenas caused clinical signs similar to feline infectious peritonitis in domestic cats or was a direct cause of mortality in hyenas. To our knowledge, this is the first report of coronavirus infection in Hyaenidae.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that differ according to their antigenic reactivity. The antigenic group 1 includes feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine coronavirus (CCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and the human coronavirus HCV 229E (Horzinek et al., 1982; Wege et al., 1982) . FCoV and CCV are chiefly transmitted by the exposure of susceptible individuals to virus in the feces of infected hosts (Pedersen et al., 1981; Tennant et al., 1993; Foley et al., 1997) and rarely in saliva (Addie and Jarrett, 2001) . CCV and FCoV frequently cause relatively benign enteric infections in domestic dogs and cats, respectively, that are normally confined to the digestive tract and regional lymph nodes (Pedersen et al., 1981; Evermann et al., 1989) . However, in a small percentage of FCoV infected domestic cats (Addie and Jarrett, 1992) more virulent strains may develop by mutations, which are able to invade and replicate in macrophages causing a virulent fatal disease termed feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (Pedersen et al., 1981; Evermann et al., 1991; Poland et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1998) . FIP is an immune-mediated disease that involves an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus infection and an immune complex-induced pathology (Horzinek and Osterhaus, 1979) . Possible synergistic infections of coronavirus and other pathogens may result in severe clinical signs (Appel, 1988) .",

Furthermore, members of the Hyaenidae may maintain viral strains that are distinct 'hyena' variants. For example, Serengeti spotted hyenas maintain a non-symptomatic rabies strain that does not cause mortality and is genetically distinct from the virulent strain of rabies that circulates in bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis) and white-tailed mongooses (Ichneumia albicauda) in the Serengeti ecosystem, and domestic dogs in Tanzania (East et al., 2001) .",

There was no obvious pattern to the locations of these differences, with respect to other strains of CCV and FCoV type II and the absence of shared blocks of homology with either CCV or FCoV type II genes suggests that the hyena isolate is probably not the result of recombination events between CCV and FCoV type II genes.

This may explain the more frequent detection of viral nucleic acids in their feces than in the feces of adults. Spotted hyenas often defecate in communal latrines (Kruuk, 1972) , and young spotted hyenas stationed at clan communal dens use communal latrines within the vicinity of the den (East and Hofer, unpublished) . In addition, during ritualized greeting ceremonies, hyenas sniff the anal area of greeting partners . Thus, infection of susceptible hyenas via contact with virus-laden feces is likely to play an important role in the transmission of the coronavirus within the spotted hyena population. This is in accordance with current knowledge of transmission of coronavirus in domestic dogs and cats, where the fecal-oral route plays the most important role and first infection usually occurs within a few weeks of birth (Addie and Jarrett, 1990; Foley et al., 1997) . Either current infection or repeated exposure to coronavirus may have increased antibody production and induced the high titer levels (\u22651:320) found in some hyenas.",

As it is known that FCoV type II arose from recombination events between FCoV type I and CCV, the high level of homology between FCoV type II, CCV and the isolate from the Serengeti spotted hyena is expected. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the spotted hyena isolate has split from a common ancestor and has undergone sufficient isolated evolution to result in a new coronavirus subgroup that is distinct from the domestic feline-and canine-subtypes (Fig. 2) . This would suggest that high levels of exposure among Serengeti hyenas are mainly due to intra-specific infection. However, as spotted hyenas occasionally eat the feces of carnivores such as lions, contact with coronavirus contained in feces of other wild carnivores is possible, and may contribute to levels of exposure and infection in spotted hyenas. It is currently unknown whether the isolate we have described in spotted hyenas also infects other Serengeti carnivores. Our genetic results also suggest that infection among Serengeti hyenas is more likely due to viral transmission within the hyena population than due to transmission from infected domestic cats or dogs in areas surrounding the National Park. To obtain a better understanding of the genetic relationship between coronavirus isolates present in the Serengeti ecosystem, and the involvement of different carnivore species in the transmission and maintenance of the virus in carnivore populations, further genetic characterization of isolates from different wild and domestic carnivore species is required. The clinical consequences of coronavirus infection in spotted hyenas should also be clarified.",

The unrooted maximum-likelihood tree (\u2212ln L = 1581.61) based on the 429 bp segment of the 5 region of the S gene(Posch et al., 2001) was recovered under the best-fit model (HKY + G) selected by hLRTs in Modeltest Version 3.06(Posada and Crandall, 1998). Base frequencies: A = 0.3042, C = 0.1875, G = 0.1908, T = 0.3175; transition/transversion ratio: 1.6559; gamma distribution shape parameter: 0.2864.
