This study was conducted to clarify the frequency and genotype circulation pattern of HBoV in Iran. Materials and Methods: Conventional PCR was performed on throat swabs of patients less than two years of age with respiratory illnesses during fall and winter 2012-2013. Results: HBoV virus DNA was detected in 15 of 140 samples (10.7 %). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis on 5 samples showed that all were HBoV1. The positive samples were negative for influenza A and B viruses while co-infection with RSV was found in 2 (13.3%). Conclusion: This study adds to the body of knowledge about the role of HBoV in acute respiratory illnesses in children in Iran.",

This rate of HBoV detection is similar to the previous reports for pediatric patients worldwide. Generally HBoV1 DNA prevalence in young children with RTIs is about 10% but in some studies reported up to 33% (13) . The diversity of reported values may be because of sampling techniques, study populations and the sensitivity of the detection assays (1). Seasonal peak of HBoV infection is different among countries and regions because of climate and other factors. Many previous studies showed a higher detection rate in winter (16) . In the current study the highest prevalence was in February (Table 1) . HBoV DNA-positive respiratory samples have a high co-infection rate reached up to 83 % (10, 12, 15, 17) . All positive samples in this research were negative for influenza A and B viruses and just two samples (13.3%) were positive for RSV (RSV/A).
