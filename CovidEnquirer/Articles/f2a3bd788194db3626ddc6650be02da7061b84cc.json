From the ones reporting being confident in the local health system, 38.4% were willing to be vaccinated, and from those not confident, only 23.5% were willing to be vaccinated. Conclusion: The decision to get vaccinated in the midst of a contagious outbreak involves many considerations. Trust in the government's technical and organization skill to deal with the infectious outbreak along with trust in medical organizations predict the adoption of recommended protection measures. The results indicate that public compliance with vaccination plans in health crisis requires the development of social and institutional trust.",

However, increasing sectors of the population have expressed hesitancy about participating in such programs. 1 Consequently, vaccination hesitancy has become a public health problem with social determinants. Research has shown that in vaccination programs for preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps and rubella, varicella, and pertussis, 2 a number of social factors have contributed to hesitancy. Less is known about hesitancy during pandemic outbreaks. In contrast with programs for preventable diseases, pandemics provide a different context for vaccination hesitancy. During pandemics, the public usually lacks understandable, dependable, and timely information about the outbreak. 3 Social and institutional trust that provides legitimacy to policymakers' actions might be undermined because of lack of reliable and truthful information. Often a new vaccine must be quickly manufactured and often may be accompanied by the misgivings of a portion of the population. Furthermore, governments tend to become involved at all stages of the response to the pandemic, thereby opening the possibility that partisan politics may infringe on the scientific response to the outbreak. 4 ",

            "text": "We examine 3 social factors in relation to vaccine hesitancy: recreancy, perceived risk of infection, and political partisanship. Recreancy is the concept used to describe the relationships among trust and risk. According to recreancy theory, the trust that individuals have in society's institutions is based on the perception of 2 important considerations: the institution's competency to perform the tasks normally associated with it, and the institution's fiduciary responsibility in the sense that it is consciously working for the best interests of the population. 5 In social risk situations, such as epidemics, trust in the government to respond effectively is important for the public to feel that their health interests will be maximally attended to. 6 Institutional recreancy is important at both the national and local levels and provides the basis for the legitimate exercise of state authority and the extent that is seen as entitled to be obeyed. The nature of public health, as a set of interventions requiring behavioral actions and lifestyle changes, requires legitimacy to achieve implementation of health policy. The local community may be viewed as a problem-solving system organized to improve the health of its residents and to be the main line of defense against contagions. 7 The local health care system therefore comes under public scrutiny and is ultimately deemed to be positive or recreant. For this reason we distinguish between trust in the federal government's ability to fight outbreaks and trust in the local hospitals' ability.",

The organization and delivery of health care are topics of serious disagreement between the 2 parties. The Republican Party tends to favor less government involvement than the Democratic Party. Although individual members of the parties do not necessarily agree with their party's position on all matters, their behavior and attitudes in many issues reflect their party's position. 15 At issue here is if members of the major parties differ in terms of willingness to receive the H1N1 vaccine.",

The results show that of the net of other factors, several variables were significantly related to the willingness to be vaccinated. Those who trust the government were more willing to get vaccinated than those lacking such trust (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] \u00bc 1.58, P < .01). Furthermore, those who trusted the local health care system were also more willing to get vaccinated than those who had little trust in the system (AOR \u00bc 1.60, P < .05). The data also showed that those concerned about contracting the flu were more willing to become vaccinated than those who were not worried about contracting the flu (AOR \u00bc 2.29, P < .01). Similarly, the odds of Republicans taking the vaccine were less than those of Democrats (AOR \u00bc .63, P < .01). With trust, fear, and partisanship taken into account, older respondents were more willing to be vaccinated (AOR \u00bc 1.11, P < .05), and whites (AOR \u00bc 2.22, P < .01) and Hispanics (AOR \u00bc 2.12, P < .05) were more willing to be vaccinated than blacks. Table 3 presents the results of the logistic regression conducted to determine the relationship between the variables and trust in the governments' ability to deal with the swine flu outbreak. People who trusted the local health care system were more likely to trust the government than were those who did not trust the local system (AOR \u00bc 4.72, P < .01). Republicans were less trusting than Democrats (AOR \u00bc .36, P < .01). Those concerned about being infected with the flu were more trusting of the government's ability than those less concerned about infection (AOR \u00bc 1.82, P < .01). In addition, the regression showed that older people were more likely than young people to trust the government (AOR \u00bc 1.13, P < .05).",

Would different outbreaks produce different results? Given the fact that viral outbreaks appear somewhere in the world much of the time, we have additional opportunities to test the recreancy hypothesis in different cultural settings. Investigations of these cases will help us determine whether vaccination is truly the most important public health development in recent years.",

Trust: trust in the national government's ability to deal with an epidemic outbreak is important to a segment of the population in its willingness to be vaccinated. Trust extends to local community health care organizations as well. 2. Political partisanship: to a significant degree, trust in the government's ability to deal with the H1N1 outbreak is based on political partisan attitudes about the proper role of government; members of political parties endorsing social health care programs are more willing to be vaccinated than others. 3. Vulnerability: age, family composition, and ethnicity are also factors influencing willingness to be vaccinated. Collectively, they point to a perceived vulnerability factor on the part of many that may be operating in the decision to seek vaccination.",

A large percentage of the sample expressed hesitancy to be vaccinated. Our study was directed at understanding the sources of this hesitancy and indicated that increasing the likelihood of the population to participate in vaccination programs requires interventions directed at increasing the trust of the population in the government public health capabilities and the role of the local hospitals. A development of a comprehensive policy to increase recreancy in situations of real social risk is needed.",
