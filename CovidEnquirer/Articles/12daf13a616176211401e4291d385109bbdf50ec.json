This increase is accomplished by additional milk or by added fat to milk or starter to increase energy density. Huber et al. (4) found that calves fed more milk consumed less starter than did calves fed less milk. Addition of tallow at 0, 2.5, 5, and 10% to limit-fed starters did not affect OMI, but improved feed efficiency (8) . When starter was fed for ad libitum intake, either 10 or 20% fat added to starter reduced intake and BW gains (13) . Calves fed starters containing 10% fat consumed 38% less DM and gained 28% less BW than calves fed starter without fat. Starters containing 20% fat reduced starter consumption and BW gains even further.",

Amount of fat in MR did not affect BW gains of calves housed at Woe. Whole milk or MR supplemented with fat did not support starter consumption in winter higher than that of unsupplemented whole milk or MR (5) , but BW gains were greater for calves fed the fat supplement. Schingoethe et al. (18) observed that BW gains in winter were higher for calves fed additional milk than for calves fed the same amount of solids in a fat supplement. Calves receiving a starter with high percentage of fat (6%) did not differ in feed intakes, BW gains, or ratios of feed to gain compared with those calves fed low fat (2%) and raised in mild winter conditions (20) .",

These data agree with those of Miller et al.(13), who found that calves fed starter supplemented with fat gained less than calves fed unsupplemented starter.The ADG from d 14 to 42 were .46 kg/d for both males and females.
