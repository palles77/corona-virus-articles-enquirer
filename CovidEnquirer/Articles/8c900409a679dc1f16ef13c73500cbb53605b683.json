Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our 10 understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses, yet few studies compare host 11 responses to different viruses while controlling other experimental parameters. We used microarray analysis 12 to compare changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory 13 viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, 14 PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect 15 peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued 16 to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses 17 elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon 18 response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense 19 genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1. Our comparative 20 approach identified universal and specific transcriptional signatures of virus infection that can be used to 21 discover mechanisms of pathogenesis in the respiratory tract.",

A Venn diagram 238 was generated to visualize the degree of overlap in IFN-related genes whose expression was induced by at 239 least one of the three viruses (Figure 4) . PR8 induced expression of the greatest number of IFN-related genes, 240 a majority of which were shared by at least one other virus. RV up-regulated slightly fewer IFN-induced 241 genes compared to PR8 and MHV infection resulted in up-regulation of the fewest IFN-induced genes.

Coronaviruses are notorious for being able to replicate within cells without triggering type I IFN 296 responses, or delaying IFN induction until late in the replication cycle [34, [50] [51] [52] . Other studies have shown 297 that the IFN response to MHV-1 is a critical determinant of susceptibility. Severe disease in A/J mice 298 compared to C57Bl/6 mice correlates with lower type I IFNs detected in the lungs of A/J mice upon MHV-1 299 infection [6, 53] . Similarly, the expression of various type I IFNs in response to MHV-1 infection in vitro is 300 cell line-dependent [53] . Because the cell line we used, LA4, was derived from the lungs of A/He mice, we 301 would expect it to have a similar response as A/J mice. Thus the lack of type I IFNs induced by MHV-1 in 302 LA4 cells in vitro corresponds with pathogenesis observed in A/J mice in vivo.",

In contrast, RV infection altered 144 expression of a large number of genes by 12 h and the expression levels were maintained at approximately the 145 same levels at the 24 h time point (Figure 1C).146 Taken together, we observed differences in magnitude and timing of gene expression changes mediated 147 by the three viruses: MHV changes were low and slow, PR8 induced gene expression to high levels at a 148 steady rate, and RV altered gene expression more quickly to peak levels by 12 h. The limited response to 149 MHV infection is in agreement with other coronaviruses, such as MHV-A59 [25] and SARS-CoV [26, 27]. In 150 addition to inducing minor transcriptional up-regulation of host genes, MHV-A59 shuts down host gene 151 expression by enhancing mRNA degradation [25]. A related coronavirus, SARS-CoV, also induces 152 degradation of host mRNAs [28]. The low numbers of host mRNAs that were altered in response to MHV 153 infection in our study could be due to one or both of these mechanisms. While rhinoviruses are also known to 154 down-regulate host gene expression by inhibiting transcription, we saw a robust increase in host RNAs early 155 upon RV infection. This is in agreement with other transcriptome studies of major and minor serogroup 156 rhinoviruses in human respiratory epithelial cells and experimental infections of humans [23, 29-32]. The 157 plateau in gene expression changes in RV-infected cells at 24 h may be due to transcriptional inhibition later 158 in infection. PR8 infection induced a strong transcriptional response in LA4 cells, which has also been seen 159 with multiple strains of influenza A viruses in primary human and mouse airway or lung epithelial cells [Host genes have shared and unique responses to RV, PR8, and MHV infection 163We identified which genes were altered by each virus at 24 h compared to mock and the degree of 164 overlap among the differentially expressed genes. As was also observed inFigure 1, at 24 h RV infection 165 resulted in up-regulation of the largest number of genes, followed by PR8 then MHV(Figure 2A). A similar 166 pattern was seen with down-regulated genes (Figure 2B). While one might worry that the small number of 167 significant genes that were altered by MHV could be false positives, the majority of these genes (65% of up-168 regulated and 86% of down-regulated genes) were also significantly altered by at least one other virus 169 suggesting that most of these genes are true positives. For both up-and down-regulated gene sets, RV had the 170 largest proportion of unique genes, while the majority of genes affected by both PR8 and MHV were shared 171 by at least one other virus.",

Heatmaps that demonstrate differences in fold change (color scale) and 255 significant differences (outlined boxes) in expression compared to mock-inoculated controls were generated 256 (Figure 4 and S2). As shown in the Venn diagram, this analysis also demonstrates that PR8 infection resulted 257 in up-regulation of the most genes involved in type I IFN responses, followed by RV then MHV. The fold 258 change values induced by PR8 infection also were generally higher than the other two viruses. However, there 259 was not a significant correlation between virus identity and functional group. For most of the functional 260 groups, MHV up-regulated expression of a smaller subset of the same genes as PR8 and RV, with the 261 exception of the MHC class I pathway (Figure 4). MHV significantly up-regulated expression of only one 262 gene involved in the MHC class I pathway (Blmh), which was not significantly up-regulated by the other two 263 viruses. This observation suggests that cytotoxic T cell responses may differ in MHV infections compared to 264 PR8 and RV. T cell responses have complex roles in MHV-1 infections, as they contribute to protection in 265 resistant mouse strains but mediate pathology in susceptible strains [41]. However, mice with the CD8+ T cell 266 repertoire of a resistant strain in the background of a susceptible strain remain susceptible to severe MHV-1 267 infection [42].

RV1B is increasingly being used in317 mouse studies [1-4, 55].
