Many factors such as cold stress, nutrition, and age and sex of the chicken influence the mortality in an outbreak (Cumming, 1965; Sinkovic and Gilchrist, 1967; Macdonald, Randall and McMartin, 1980) . Those strains of virus which induce more severe kidney disease are also associated with higher mortality rates (Siller and Cumming, 1974; Chong and Apostolov, 1982) .",

Several histological investigations of the development of kidney lesions through the course of experimental infections have shown interstitial inflammatory reactions and tubular degeneration occurring in both proximal and distal segments of the nephron (Siller and Cumming, 1974; Pohl, 1974; Purcell, Tham and Surman, 1976) . Chong and Apostolov ( 1982) ) by immuno-fluoresence, demonstrated the presence of viral antigen in all segments of tubules, but the staining was mainly confined to the proximal tubules. These workers incriminated the replication of the virus in the tubular epithelium as a direct cause of the disease. This paper presents a quantitative morphological analysis of the changes in structure of the proximal tubular epithelial cells over the course of an experimental infection with IBV.

Data were collected from the digitizing tablet by tracing the outline of individual structures with a cursor for whole cell, nucleus, microvillus and extracellular space at low magnification level. At the high magnification, the following structures were analysed within a reference area overlay arbitrarily placed over the micrographs; microvillus membrane, apical tubular membrane, apical vacuoles, lysosomes, apical and basal mitochondria cristal and inner mitochondria membrane, lipid droplets and basolateral membrane. Stereological characteristics were calculated from standard formulae (Weibel, 1963; Williams, 1977) . Formfactor is the ratio, 48 x area divided by (perimeter)* which gives an estimate of shape of structures. This ratio is I.0 for a perfect circle. Nucleus profile diameter was calculated by taking the square root of the product of the diameters measured at right angles. By assuming that the nucleus was spherical, Fullman's formula (Williams, 1977 was applied to determine the mean nucleus diameter. The absolute volumes of the cell and cell components were then extrapolated from the nucleus volume and the relative volume densities.",

To increase the significance of the results the minimal sample size was exceeded with an extra animal in experimental groups, as this type of sampling has greater statistical weight than increasing the number of micrographs examined from a smaller group. The systematic subsampling employed has been shown to be a valid method of obtaining a representative unbiased measurement for morphometric analysis of a polarized tissue (Burri et al., 1968; Schroeder and Munzel-Pedrazzoli, 1970) . In order to determine the trend of the results through the course of the disease, statistical analysis for linear and quadratic regression against time was performed by applying the t-test to orthogonal polynomials (Hicks, 1973) .

The reduction of microvillus volume was due to shortening and focal loss of microvilli. Estimators of cell and nucleus shapes are listed in Table 3 . There was an increase in cell formfactor at day 4 and an increase in cell maximal diameter at day 8, indicating that initially the cells became rounder and then decreased in size and became more elongated, returning to normal dimensions at day 12.

The membrane available for transport of fluid and ions across the ceil was thus decreased.

Further evidence for change in water and ion transport is the dilated endoplasmic reticulum and the alteration in mitochondrial size and shape. The severity and degree of the changes observed correspond to stages 2 and 3 described by Trump, Croker and Mergner (1971) in their review of the pathogenesis of cell injury.

Evidence for cell lysis as the means of viral release has frequently been presented from studies in which the tissues have not received optimal preservation. Adequate preservation of tissue is essential to minimize fixation artefacts. Lysis and rupture of cells was not a feature of this study in which tissues were perfused with a carefully monitored fixative. Immersion fixation is unsuitable since rapid collapse of the tissue causes damage to the tubular epithelium including protrusion of the apical cytoplasm into the lumen and disruption of the microvillus border of the cells (Maunsbach, 1966a; Rothwell, 1974 Chong and Apostolov (1982) , who used immersion fixation, concluded that lysis of cells was the primary cause of nephritis induced by IBV but the type of lysis of cells which they observed may be readily produced by inadequate fixation. Doughri, Storz, Hajer and Fernando (1976) , Chasey and Alexander (1976) and Bielefeldt-Ohmann and Bloch (1982) h ave presented evidence that release of coronavirus may occur by fusion of viral-containing cytoplasmic vacuoles with the plasma membrane.",

Release of virus by this means and survival of the infected cell to enable the further maturation of viral particles may play some part in the development of persistent infections which have been reported for some coronaviruses including IBV (Robb and Bond, 1979) . The proximal tubular epithelium has been shown to be very sensitive to differences in the osmotic pressure of fixative components (Maunsbach, 1966b; Rothwell, 1978) . Alterations in the concentrations of ions and hence of osmotic pressure initiated by IBV infection will cause changes in the osmotic differential of a fixative which is kept constant.",

With more concentrated solutions, Maunsbach (1966b) observed widened extracellular spaces similar to the spaces observed at day 12, but further evidence that this is an osmotic effect, such as shrunken nuclei and densly staining cytoplasm, is lacking. These widened spaces may be related to the vesicular structures observed by SEM. Permeability of infected cells to trypan blue (Robb and Bond, 1979) may be due to these \"holes\" in the plasma membrane.",

The evidence presented in our study of structural alterations in tubular epithelial cells during the course of IBV infection indicates that impaired fluid and electrolyte transport is responsible for the kidney disease and renal failure caused by IBV. Further work (Condron and Marshall, 1985) is in progress to determine the alteration in the function of the proximal tubular epithelium and to relate it to the structural changes described in this paper. Whilst stereological methods have been used in a wide range of EM investigations of experimental pathology, to the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a morphometric analysis of ultrastructural changes in an organ induced by a viral infection. These techniques, designed to define the extent and nature of structural changes in all cells in a particular organ, can play a valuable role in determining virus-host cell interactions and the pathogenesis of viral diseases.",
