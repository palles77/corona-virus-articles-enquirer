We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R 0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R 0 will be underestimated. We also show that as the length of asymptomatic generation intervals increase, estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase of the epidemic decrease. Our analysis provides a rationale for assessing the duration of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in addition to their prevalence in the population.",

We divide incidence i into two categories -i a and i s -corresponding to incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively. Newly infected individuals that are either asymptomatically or symptomatically infected can transmit the disease to others, but they differ in their intrinsic reproduction numbers, R a and R s , respectively, as well as intrinsic generation-interval distributions [7] , g a (\u03c4 ) and g s (\u03c4 ). Generation intervals, which are defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person [8] , depend on the natural history of infection: individuals with subclinical infections may have fast clearance and short generation intervals, or slow viral reproduction and long generation intervals (cf. [9] ). The shape of the generation-interval distribution characterizes the relationship between the epidemic growth rate r and the reproduction number [10] .",
