            "text": "Objectives: A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed and used to detect and quantify hMPV in respiratory specimens. Study design: The quantitative RT-PCR assay amplified an approximately 70 base pair fragment from the hMPV fusion protein gene. The assay was validated and used to test respiratory specimens obtained from children seen at a hospital in Seattle, Washington, from December 2002 through May 2003. Results: The assay detected 1000 hMPV copies/mL of specimen, did not detect 19 other respiratory viruses, and was able to detect and accurately quantify isolates from the four known hMPV genetic lineages in a proficiency panel of 20 previously tested samples. hMPV was detected in 52 (7.2%) of 719 pediatric respiratory specimens. The mean log 10 copies/mL of hMPV in the 52 positive specimens was 7.67 (range = 4.59-10.60). Children aged 7-12 months had a significantly higher hMPV prevalence (12.4%) than did children younger than 7 months (4.7%) (P < 0.005). Children in this age group also had significantly higher levels of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (mean log 8.43 copies/mL) than did the younger children (mean log 6.93 copies/mL) (P = 0.0025). Conclusions: The rapid real-time RT-PCR assay described here is a sensitive test for clarifying the epidemiology of and diseases associated with hMPV.",

Both upper and lower respiratory tract infections have been associated with hMPV in young children and adults and the clinical symptoms are similar to those of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Peret et al., 2002; Freymuth et al., 2003; Viazov et al., 2003; Boivin et al., 2002) . hMPV cannot be reliably cultivated in many commonly used laboratory cell lines (van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Boivin et al., 2002) and there is no commercially available antigen detection test. However, hMPV genomic ribonucleic acid (RNA) can be detected in clinical specimens using conventional (Stockton et al., 2002; Freymuth et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Maggi et al., 2003; Viazov et al., 2003; Madhi et al., 2003; Ebihara et al., 2004; Galiano et al., 2004; Falsey et al., 2003; Bastien et al., 2003; van den Hoogen et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2004; Mullins et al., 2004; Esper et al., 2004) or real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Mackay et al., 2003; Boivin et al., 2003) . Genetic analysis has identified two major subgroups of hMPV, with two minor genetic clusters within each subgroup (van den Hoogen et al., 2004; Boivin et al., 2004) . Reliable diagnostic tests that can detect hMPV strains from all four genetic lineages are needed for accurate diagnosis of hMPV infections.",

Several technical aspects of this assay warrant discussion. One of the strengths of our study was that, by testing every specimen for an external amplification control, false negative specimens due to inefficient RNA extraction or the presence of PCR inhibitors could be ruled out. However, we could not control for other factors that could lead to false negative results, such as stage of the patient's illness, or possible degradation of viral RNA during specimen transport. A previous re-port has suggested that RT-PCR primers that target the hMPV nucleoprotein or polymerase genes may be more suitable for hMPV detection than are primers that target the matrix, phosphoprotein, or fusion protein genes . As part of our study, we compared primers and probes designed to detect the hMPV fusion protein gene to an RT-PCR assay with primers that target the nucleoprotein gene (Maertzdorf et al., 2004) . The hMPV fusion protein-based assay accurately detected and quantified hMPV isolates belonging to all four known genetic lineages. Detection of all the known subtypes of hMPV was achieved by using two primer/probe sets in the PCR reaction. Each set was designed to amplify isolates belonging to subtype A or B, but used together in one reaction mix. Whether specific hMPV subtypes are associated with the severity of illness, as has been shown for RSV (Martinello et al., 2002) , has not been determined. Future work using the primer/probe sets from this assay in separate RT-PCR reactions will provide information about this question. Fig. 3 . The proportion of specimens positive for hMPV by RT-PCR and the mean number of hMPV, expressed as log 10 copies/mL, detected in the positive specimens were determined among the total number of respiratory specimens collected from patients belonging to each of five age groups.",

            "text": "The 7.2% prevalence of hMPV found in specimens obtained from children with respiratory illness in Seattle is similar to the 4-18% prevalence reported by others in different parts of the world, using both conventional and real-time RT-PCR methods (Peiris et al., 2003; Viazov et al., 2003; Ebihara et al., 2004; Boivin et al., 2003; Mullins et al., 2004) . The prevalence of hMPV in nasal swab specimens was significantly higher than in nasal wash specimens. The reason for collection of a swab rather than a wash from a particular patient is not known, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relative utility of each of these samples for hMPV detection. However, these data show hMPV can readily be detected from swab specimens. Interestingly, hMPV was detected in specimens submitted from symptomatic children in all months surveyed and ranged from 4.4% to 17.4% of specimens submitted. The peak months of April and May for hMPV detection in our population agree with some published reports that the prevalence of hMPV is higher in spring (March, April, or May) compared to winter months (December, January, or February) (Peiris et al., 2003; Galiano et al., 2004; Boivin et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2004; Mullins et al., 2004; Esper et al., 2004) . The median age of 11.5 months for hMPV positive children is also similar to that reported by others (Williams et al., 2004; Mullins et al., 2004) . Of note, the patient age group with the highest prevalence of hMPV (7-12 months) was older than the age group with the highest prevalence of RSV infection (0-6 months) reported in a previous study (Kuypers et al., 2004) .",

More importantly, hMPV was detected in 10.6% of specimens for which no other viral pathogen was detected by FA. This is the first report of quantification of hMPV in pediatric respiratory specimens, although interpretation of these results must take into account the variability between patients in collection of respiratory specimens. In our collection and testing methods, both inter and extra-cellular viral RNA were detected by the assay so that the specimen volume, more than the number of cells in a sample, determined the viral load. Volumes were recorded for each specimen and varied across the study by a factor of four. While the viral load comparisons in this paper are based on respiratory specimens that do vary in volume and inferences should be made with caution, a 10-fold difference in hMPV copies/mL between specimens is most likely a real difference. The mean number of hMPV in these specimens (7.67 log 10 copies/mL) was similar to the mean number of RSV (7.30 log 10 copies/mL) detected in pediatric respiratory specimens (Kuypers et al., 2004) . For RSV infections, the virus load was significantly higher for patients in the lowest (0-6 months) age group compared to older RSV positive children (Kuypers et al., 2004) , while for hMPV, children 7-12 months old had significantly higher levels of hMPV than did younger children. Ongoing inves-tigations will help determine any associations between viral load and clinical signs and symptoms.",
