The aim of this work was to amplify and diversify the autoimmune response restricted to FAH through the use of the exogenous adjuvant called PADRE. Accordingly, C57BL/6 mice were chosen, because these animals respond to PADRE better than other mouse strains. Results presented herein indicate that, surprisingly, C57BL/6 mice developed signs of autoimmune hepatitis-like disease (AIH), including transient hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated transaminases, autoAb directed against different liver proteins and hepatic cellular infiltrates, indicating that a new model of experimental AIH could be generated by a viral inoculation. Furthermore, PADRE administration amplified the MHV effect, extending the duration of hypergammaglobulinemia and increasing the binding of autoAb as well as the degree of hepatic infiltrates. However, the adjuvant did not expand the time of the symptoms. Additionally, since plasmatic uric acid and high-mobility group box protein 1 (HGMB1) concentrations augmented in MHV-and/or PADRE-treated mice, it is suggested that both alarmins were probably involved in the spreading of the immune response induced by the viral infection and the adjuvant administration.",

In those models, liver damage was observed, and in some conditions elevated transaminases. However, no Ab to liver proteins other than those directed to the immunogen, neither high Ig plasmatic levels were reported. In addition, most models were described as transient, since the mechanisms critical for perpetuation of liver damage are still unknown [for a review see Refs. 3, 5, 6] . Besides, we have recently found that a simple and common phenomenon, i.e., a viral infection inducing autoAb to an autologous protein followed by a toxic liver injury, could induce some signs of AIH [18] . It was proposed that the release of a greater amount of alarmins [22] could induce the expansion of the autoimmune response and establish a pathology that resembles AIH [18] .",

In spite of that, it was observed that MHV and/or PADRE inoculation worsened the condition, since more important infiltrates were observed, mainly in \"MHV + PADRE\" animals. Injured hepatocytes liberated transaminases, as indicated by the elevated concentrations of the enzymes at 15 and 30 days postinfection although, intriguingly, their plasmatic values were similar to those of controls after 45 days of treatment.",

One could speculate that plasmatic uric acid in \"MHV + PADRE\" mice after 30 days of treatment was similar to controls, and lower than values found in \"MHV\" animals, due to urate crystals retention within the hepatocytes. In fact, once the uric acid concentration was tested in whole liver tissue 30 days after treatment, results showed identical values in \"MHV\" and \"MHV + PADRE\" animals. On the other hand, serum HGMB1 concentration significantly augmented with time in the three animal groups, even in \"PADRE\" mice.",

As it was found that the uric acid levels present in plasma from \"PADRE\" animals were elevated, but not in the hepatocyte extracts, the origins of both alarmins are probably not the hepatocytes, but perhaps the stimulated lymphocytes or other non antigen-specific leucocytes. One can also speculate that PADRE is recognized by some PRRs (pattern-recognizing receptors such as the Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors), a fact that has, to our knowledge, not been reported so far.",

Therefore, the first part of the objective was reached, since our present results demonstrate that infection of susceptible individuals with a hepatotropic virus triggers some AIH signs. Moreover, since the administration of PADRE adjuvant seemed to expand some MHV effects, one can speculate that a simple vaccination of an infected genetically vulnerable person may eventually initiate the illness. Nevertheless, the chronic phase of the disease, as well as the fibrosis normally found in liver of AIH patients is still lacking in our model. Although more efforts are needed to achieve that goal, the findings indicate that a simple infection with a virus, instead of complex and not natural protocols of immunization, may simulate the onset of the illness and contribute to the study of its pathophysiology. the manuscript.
