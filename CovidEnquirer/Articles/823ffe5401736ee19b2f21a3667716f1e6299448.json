Piglets that were I -12 days of age and given 1.0, 10.0 or 20.0 IU nHuIFNa had significantly (PcO.01) greater survival rates than placebo-treated piglets; survival rates were the greater for the highest level of nHuIFNcx treatment.

            "text": "The variable effects of therapy observed in this study are consistent with the modulating effects of many biological response modifiers, including IFNcu. Factors influencing this variability include dose and route of IFNa therapy in relationship to both age and time of exposure to the infectious agent. Others have observed that IFNa therapy after infection is beneficial whereas IFNcw therapy prior to infection is contraindicated (Oppenheim et al., 1987) . Similarly, high doses of IFNa are sometimes less beneficial than the lower doses (Cummins et al., 1988; Koech et al., 1990; Young et al., 1990) . Thus, IFNcv therapy for TGE may exhibit a dose-dependent effect and efficacy may also vary according to the age and time of exposure to TGEV. Both effects were observed in this field trial.",

However, porcine blood mononuclear cells are known to secrete IFNcw after induction by TGEV (Nowacki et. al., 1993) and that IFN production gradually increases with the age of the animal. The beneficial effects of oral nHuIFNa therapy observed in this study may be related to the immune responsiveness of oral IFN therapy. Studies in piglets with both experimental and natural rotavirus infection showed a significant weight gain benefit and a reduction in enteric disease (Lecce et al., 1990) .",
