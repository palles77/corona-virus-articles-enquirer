One group has reported that C57BL/6 ACE2 (\u00c0/\u00c0) mice exhibit a severe reduction in cardiac contractility, which is rescued in the ACE (\u00c0/\u00c0)/ACE2 (\u00c0/\u00c0) double knockout. 6 In contrast, another group has disclosed that ACE2 (\u00c0/\u00c0) mice of 129/SvEv, C57BL/6, and mixed background do not exhibit cardiac contractility defects, but have increased susceptibility to angiotensin II-induced hypertension. 7 While, a third group has revealed that male ACE (\u00c0/Y) mice are more susceptible to heart failure and death after transverse aortic constriction than their normal littermates. 8 Supporting a role for ACE2 in cardiac function, transgenic mice overexpressing ACE2 in the heart have lower mean arterial pressure with rare focal myocyte vacuolization, myofibril splaying, and nuclear enlargement. Many of these mice develop terminal ventricular fibrillation with lethal arrhythmias. 9 Furthermore, male ACE2 (\u00c0/Y) mice, but not female ACE2 (\u00c0/\u00c0) mice, also accumulate fibrillar collagen in the renal glomerular mesangium, leading to development of glomerulosclerosis of the kidneys. 10 In addition, ACE2 (\u00c0/\u00c0) mice exhibit lower body weights than wild type mice with reduced fat mass. 11 Moreover, ACE2 is also utilized by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus as the receptor for infection. 12 ACE2 (\u00c0/\u00c0) mice are resistant to SARS corona virus infection. 13 Finally, ACE2 (\u00c0/\u00c0) mice have enhanced vascular permeability, increased lung edema, and worsened lung function in several murine acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) models. 14 With the many potential functions of ACE2, small molecule inhibitors of this enzyme could be utilized to help further define the physiological roles of this protease.",

            "text": "ACE2 belongs to the zinc metalloprotease family and it has been reported that classical ACE inhibitors such as captopril and lisinopril do not attenuate ACE2 enzyme activity. As part of a strategy to discover lead molecules for an ACE2 inhibitor program, a directed screen of ACE2 versus a set of metalloprotease inhibitors from the GlaxoSmithKline compound collection was performed. Surprisingly, although confirming that classical ACE inhibitors like captopril were inactive in the screen, the thiol acid 1a was identified as a potent ACE2 inhibitor (K i App = 86 nM). 15 This biphenyl analog 1a is a known dual ACE and M13 metalloprotease neutral endopeptidase (neprilysin, NEP, EC 3.4.24.11) inhibitor (ACE K i App = 30 nM, NEP K i App = 1.1 nM). 16 It also inhibits the M14 metalloprotease carboxypeptidase A1 (CpA, EC 3.4.17.1, K i App = 1,200 nM). Speculating that the thiol functioned as a binding group for the active site zinc and that the carboxylic acid served as a recognition element for the enzyme's monocarboxypeptidase activity, the benzyl and methylene p-biphenyl moieties were surmised to be the P 1 and P 1 0 substituents. With this premise, the structure activity relationships of the P 1 position of the lead inhibitor were explored with the goal of improving potency and reducing ACE and NEP inhibitory activity. The thiol analogs 1a-1s were prepared as depicted in Scheme 1. The acids 3a-3s were activated in situ via the carbodiimide, converted into the activated esters with the aza-hydroxybenzotriazole, and then coupled to the amine hydrochloride 4 to produce the fully protected amides. Subsequent hydrolysis of the methyl ester, as well as the thioacetate, with lithium hydroxide afforded the thiol acids 1a-1s. 17",

Thus, the iso-butyl 1o analog is not only a potent ACE2 inhibitor (K i App = 1.4 nM), but also a low nanomolar ACE (K i App = 3.2 nM) and subnanomolar NEP inhibitor (K i App = 0.28 nM). ACE is less tolerant of bulky b-branching, with the neo-pentyl 1p analog exhibiting potent dual ACE2 (K i App = 7.1 nM) and NEP (K i App = 2.6 nM) inhibition with good selectivity over ACE (K i App = 2700 nM). Larger b-branched substituents like the methylene cyclohexyl 1q (ACE2 K i App = 420 nM, ACE K i App = 840 nM, NEP K i App = 130 nM) and methylene b-naphthyl 1r (ACE2 K i App = 550 nM, ACE K i App = 210 nM, NEP K i App = 140 nM) attenuate inhibitory activity at all three enzymes. Finally, as the ethylene phenyl analog 1 s shows, like ACE2 (K i App = 860 nM), ACE (K i App = 93 nM) was less tolerant of c-branching in P 1 groups, while NEP (K i App = 2.6 nM) accepted it. None of these thiol-based inhibitors was a potent inhibitor of CpA.",

            "text": "A model of the thiol 1i 19,20 docked into the active site of ACE2 based on the recent X-ray crystal structure 21 is shown in Figure 1 . It provides insight into the SAR of the thiol series. In addition to binding to the imidazole nitrogens of 374 His and 378 His and the carboxylate of 402 Glu, the active site zinc coordinates the thiol of the inhibitor. Also, the terminal carboxylate of the inhibitor forms electrostatic interactions with the guanidine of 273 Arg and accepts hydrogen bonds from the imidazoles of 345 His and 505 His. Moreover, the carbonyl of 346 Pro accepts a hydrogen bond from the amide nitrogen of the inhibitor, while the amide carbonyl is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to 515 Tyr. Furthermore, the P 1 0 methylene biphenyl substituent of 1i forms significant lipophilic interactions with the quite large S 1 0 channel composed of the lengthwise canal between the two subdomains, including residues 274 Phe, 276 Thr, 346 Pro, 367 Asp, 370 Leu, 371 Thr, and 374 His. This biphenyl substituent is hypothesized to occupy a different part of this large pocket than the carboxyl inhibitor co-crystallized in 1R4L. The P 1 (R)-sec-butyl group of the inhibitor forms van der Waals interactions with the S 1 pocket composed of 347 Thr, 504 Phe, 510 Tyr, and 514 Arg. As shown in the close-up of the S 1 subsite depicted in Figure 2 , 510 Tyr forms part of a pocket which the abranched methyl of the P 1 (R)-sec-butyl group occupies. Larger substituents are disfavored as they would require movement of the phenol side chain of 510 Tyr. Thus, this model agrees with the SAR, since the S 1 subsite can tolerate cyclobutyl and cyclopentyl substituents, but is less accepting of a cyclohexyl group.",

From the model, it is apparent that the methyl group of the (R)-sec-butyl P 1 moiety of inhibitor 1i bumps into the enzyme, helping explain the 330-fold selectivity for ACE2 versus ACE. The branching nature of 518 Val (atom CG1) makes this portion of the S 1 pocket smaller than in ACE2. 518 Val is the homologous residue in ACE to 510 Tyr in ACE2. This 510 Tyr to 518 Val substitution from ACE2 to ACE and resulting alteration of the S 1 pocket volume helps explain the reduced ability of ACE to accommodate a-branching in P 1 substituents.",

            "text": "In summary, a series of a-thiol amide-based inhibitors of ACE2 with varied substituents at the P 1 position were synthesized. Inhibitors containing linear alkyl P 1 moieties were some of the more potent analogs in the ACE2 enzymatic assay. The smaller a-branched P 1 substituents, exemplified by inhibitors 1i and 1l, maintained similar potencies, and increased selectivity versus ACE and NEP. Information gained from these studies has proven to be useful in the design of other ACE2 inhibitors. These inhibitors will be reported in due course. Furthermore, a potent pan ACE/ACE2/NEP inhibitor 1o and a potent dual ACE2/NEP inhibitor 1p have been identified. These tools may prove useful in further defining the roles these proteases play in the RAS cascade. When hydrolyses were carried out with reactions open to the atmosphere, varying amounts of disulfide products were isolated, likely from aerobic oxidation. The enzyme assays contain a reducing agent, tris-(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP), to prevent oxidation of the thiols to disulfides during the assays. Dilutions of 10 mM stock solutions of the thiols 1a-1s to final assay concentrations were done with 50% aqueous acetonitrile just prior to protease inhibition studies. Under these standard conditions, both the thiols and their corresponding disulfides showed enzyme inhibitory activity. Presumably, the disulfides were reduced to their corresponding thiols by TCEP during the pre-incubation period, before substrates were added. In contrast, if the assays were performed without TCEP, the disulfides were completely inactive, while the potencies of the thiols were attenuated, probably because of partial aerobic oxidation to their corresponding disulfides during the pre-incubation period. 18. Alcohols 2m and 2n are commercially available. Alcohol 2k was prepared from cyclobutane methanol in three steps. First, oxidation of the alcohol with pyridinium chlorochromate afforded the aldehyde. Then, reaction of the aldehyde with trimethylsilyl cyanide and N-methyl morpholine N-oxide provided the silyl protected cyano-",
