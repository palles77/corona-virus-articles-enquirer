Seven PUPs had not been reported previously, and two of them were predicted to contain transmembrane regions. Eight ORFs partially overlapped with or embedded into those of known genes, revealing that the SARS-CoV genome is a small and compact one with overlapped coding regions. The most striking discovery is that an ORF locates on the minus strand. We have also annotated non-coding regions and identified the transcription regulating sequences (TRS) in the intergenic regions. The analysis of TRS supports the minus strand extending transcription mechanism of coronavirus. The SNP analysis of different isolates reveals that mutations of the sequences do not affect the prediction results of ORFs.",

With parameters trained from the known genes (R, S, E, M, and N), Glimmer (Version 2) predicted nine ORFs that were named G1\u223cG9. BGFV identified another nine genes that were named B1\u223cB9. Besides the computational prediction, we manually identified five more ORFs (BGI-PUP-S-1\u223cS-5) as candidates. Each of these candidates has an upstream region matching the pattern of TRS and its translated sequence is longer than 40 amino acids. All ORFs mentioned above were uniformly listed according to their initial sites along the genome sequence, and the predicted physiochemical properties of these ORFs were presented as well ( Figure 1 ; Table 1 ).",

It suggests that the gradient of subgenomic mRNA amount results in that the large mRNA tends to premature and generates less proteins than the small subgenomic mRNAs (20 ) . Site-directed mutations to TRSs along the genome decrease the transcriptional efficiencies or even eliminate the synthesis of the subgenomic RNAs. Mutations introduced in different places demonstrate that the upstream TRSs do not affect the downstream ones, but the latter affect the replication of the former. It provides a possible interpretation why the downstream proteins are richer in infected cells than the upstream ones (21 ) . Although mutations in TRSs reduce their opportunities of transcription, some subgenomic mR-NAs are synthesized with the mutated sites performed as markers, and the origin of the fused region (here refers TRS) can be traced. These results show that all the TRSs come from the body sequences rather than the leaders, and provide evidence for the minus-strand extending transcription model (22 ) .",
