            "text": "Background: This study examined the contribution of airway inflammation to the delayed lung function recovery that occurs in some people following virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Methods: Subjects (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 40) were recruited at hospital admission for acute asthma exacerbation. Respiratory virus infection was diagnosed by viral nucleic acid detection and/or cell culture, using induced sputum, nasal, or throat swabs. Data collected included lung function, answers to common cold and asthma control questionnaires, and induced sputum cellular profiles. Subjects were reexamined 4 to 6 weeks postexacerbation and were compared with stable asthmatic subjects (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 26) who had been recruited from ambulatory care clinics. Results: Persistent airway obstruction, defined as lung function improvement at follow-up (ie, change in FEV 1 percent predicted [\u232c%FEV 1 ]) of <15%, was observed in 10 subjects (25%). Airway recovery (\u232c%FEV 1 , > 15%) was observed in the remaining subjects (30 subjects; 75%). During the acute episode, the airway-recovery group had increased total cell count (p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.019), increased number of neutrophils (p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.005), and increased percentage of neutrophils (p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.0043) compared to the group of stable subjects with asthma. Postexacerbation, the airway-recovery group had reduced numbers of neutrophils and an increased percentage of eosinophils. In contrast, during exacerbation, subjects with persistent airway obstruction showed no differences in inflammatory cell counts compared to stable subjects with asthma, nor did cell counts change postexacerbation. Symptoms improved in both groups postexacerbation. However, in the persistent-airway-obstruction group, asthma remained uncontrolled. Conclusion: Persistent airway obstruction and uncontrolled asthma are observed in some people after viral asthma exacerbations. These abnormalities are not associated with inflammatory cell influx into the airway lining fluid during the exacerbation and may reflect the involvement of noncellular elements. Further work should explore other mechanisms leading to incomplete airway recovery.

            "text": "S evere exacerbations of asthma are responsible for a large burden of illness in Australia and throughout the world. Viral infection is the main cause of asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalization, 1 with respiratory viruses being isolated from 81% of patients with asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalization in adults and children. 2 The mechanisms driving viral asthma exacerbations are clearly differ-ent from the well-characterized pathogenesis of allergen-induced asthma, which is driven by an interleukin (IL)-5-mediated eosinophil infiltrate. [3] [4] [5] Viral asthma exacerbations involve a marked neutrophil infiltration together with eosinophil degranulation. 2,6 -10 The chemokine RANTES (or regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), which promotes eosinophil degranulation, and the cytokine IL-10, which suppresses eosinophil cellular infiltration, may be important in this inflammatory response, as the gene expression of these mediators is up-regulated in patients with virus-induced asthma. 11 Despite optimal medical therapy, incomplete recovery of airway function occurs in a relatively high proportion of people after an acute asthma exacerbation. Corne et al 12 observed that in people with asthma who were infected with human rhinovirus (RV), lower respiratory tract symptoms were experienced more often, were more severe, and were of longer duration than in nonasthmatic people. Persistent lower respiratory symptoms in people with asthma extended up to 35 days, which is well beyond the 7-day expected duration of common cold symptoms. Chang et al 13 described a group with prolonged episodes of persistent asthma that lasted months to years and was triggered by symptoms of viral infection in 89% of cases. Incomplete recovery of peak expiratory flow (PEF) has also been reported after acute episodes of asthma. 14 In another study, 15 there was a trend for asthmatic subjects with human RV infection to have lower PEF measurements during convalescence. Delayed recovery of lung function has also been reported following COPD exacerbations, with 25% of subjects not recovering to baseline PEF levels after 5 weeks. 16, 17 Thus, persistent airway abnormality after respiratory exacerbation is a well-documented clinical problem, occurring both in patients with asthma and with COPD.",

The subjects were studied again 4 to 6 weeks postexacerbation. Participants provided nasal/throat swabs, and underwent skin allergen testing and spirometry. Participants also completed the common cold questionnaire (CCQ) 21 and the asthma control questionnaire (ACQ). 22 The ACQ is a seven-item questionnaire that has been validated to measure the goals of asthma management (ie, minimization of daytime and nighttime symptoms, activity limitation, \u2424 2 -agonist use, and bronchoconstriction). Analysis of asthma status using this scoring system has determined that well-controlled asthma has an optimal cut point of \u03fd 0.75, while a score of \u03fe 1.50 indicates inadequately controlled asthma. 22 At follow-up, subjects were categorized into one of the following two groups: the persistent-airway-obstruction group, defined as subjects with an improvement in lung function (ie, change in FEV 1 percent predicted [\u232c%FEV 1 ]) \u03fd15%; and the airwayrecovery group, defined as a \u232c%FEV 1 of \u0546 15%. Stable subjects with asthma who were recruited within the same study period were included as a comparison group. They met American Thoracic Society criteria 23 for asthma diagnosis, had experienced no change in asthma activity or respiratory infections in the last 4 weeks, and were recruited from John Hunter Hospital ambulatory care clinics. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants for this study, which was approved by the Hunter Area Health Service and University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committees.",

All PCR assays (TaqMan; Applied Biosystems) proceeded using 12.5% of the complementary DNA product and a commercially available kit (RealMasterMix Probe ROX kit; Eppendorf AG; Hamburg, Germany), all with the same cycling parameters, namely, 2 min at 95\u00b0C to activate the PCR assay (HotMaster Taq DNA PCR; Eppendorf AG) and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s followed by 1 min at 60\u00b0C (ABI 7500 cycler; Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA). Subjects were considered to be positive for virus if the presence of a virus was determined by either direct molecular detection (ie, gel PCR or real-time PCR) in sputum, swab (nasal or throat), or saliva specimens or by post-cell culture molecular detection (gel PCR or real-time PCR) in sputum or saliva specimens.",

Approximately one in four people recovering from a severe asthma exacerbation with virus infection experience minimal improvement in lung function. They continue to experience persistent airway obstruction and poor asthma control. This study is the first to examine the role of lower airway inflammation in this phenomenon. We have determined that subjects with persistent airway obstruction following virus exacerbation had, at the time of the exacerbation, levels of total inflammatory cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes in the airway that were similar to those in stable subjects with asthma. Furthermore, the inflammatory cell profile in the lower airways of these individuals did not change postexacerbation, despite some improvement in symptoms. This is a clinically important group, as, despite the absence of inflammatory cell influx into the airways during exacerbation, their asthma symptoms were uncontrolled during the exacerbation, and, although symptoms improved 4 to 6 weeks postexacerbation, they continued to be uncontrolled.",

Thus, while the two groups were clinically similar during exacerbations, they were distinctly different at recovery. This may reflect differences in the groups before or as a result of viral infection. Due to the design of this study, preexacerbation data are not available. However, the higher dose of maintenance ICSs used in the persistent-airway-obstruction group suggests that this group had more severe illness before the exacerbation, and it is possible that they may have had preexisting airflow obstruction. Incomplete clinical recovery from exacerbations has been reported 16 previously in COPD patients, with 25% of patients experiencing exacerbations not recovering to baseline lung function at 5 weeks. Seemungal et al 16 related exacerbation length to the magnitude of acute deterioration. While the extent of acute deterioration cannot be assessed by our study design, the data in Table 2 suggest that acute episodes were of similar severity in the two groups. Another longitudinal study 17 in COPD patients found that, over time, clinical recovery to baseline levels (FEV 1 and symptoms) after an exacerbation took longer. The mechanisms by which recovery rate slows over time are unclear, but it has been suggested that this may be associated with postviral increases in airway and systemic inflammation. 17 Our data indicated that subjects in the persistent-airwayobstruction group had a longer duration of asthma. If this group had been followed up for a longer time, a return to baseline FEV 1 may eventually have been observed. An alternate study design, which allowed the assessment of airflow obstruction preexacerbation, would be required to test this hypothesis.",

            "text": "During asthma exacerbation, the airway-recovery group showed elevated total inflammatory cell counts, which were driven by increased numbers of neutrophils (Fig 2) that decreased postexacerbation (Table 4 ). This is consistent with the known effects of viral infection in the airway. 11 Conversely, patients in the persistent-airway-obstruction group showed a lower airway inflammatory profile during exacerbations similar to those with stable asthma (Fig 2) , and this did not change significantly postexacerbation (Table 4 ). This is surprising, considering the wellestablished role of the neutrophil in driving an innate immune response to viral infection. However, the apparent insensitivity of lower airway inflammation to the presence of virus suggests that there is a suppression of the innate immune response in these subjects. The persistent-airway-obstruction group had been using a higher maintenance dose of ICSs than the airway-recovery group (Table 1 ). It is possible that high doses of ICSs may be inhibiting the generation of inflammatory mediators 32 such as tumor necrosis factor-\u2423, IL-1, and IL-6, thereby preventing the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways. 33 There are a number of mechanisms associated with viral infection that may lead to the persistence of abnormal lung function and poor asthma control postexacerbation that are not dependent on inflammatory cell influx. Virus-induced eosinophil activation may increase the release of mediators such as ECP 34 and leukotriene C4, 35, 36 which may worsen asthma symptoms. Activated eosinophils may also drive neurogenic inflammation by releasing eosinophil major basic protein, which is an endogenous antagonist for M2 muscarinic receptors. These receptors normally inhibit the release of acetylcholine, but when blocked by major basic protein, acetylcholine is released, resulting in airway muscle hyperresponsiveness. 37 Viral induction of vascular leakage has also been reported, with mediators such as IL-8 and ECP 38 being exuded into the airway lumen, which may sustain and perpetuate the inflammatory process. 39 Viral activation of mast cells, leading to increases in histamine release, may also contribute to worsened asthma. 40 Mucus hypersecretion has also been linked to viral infection. 41, 42 Thus, there are a range of different virus-induced mechanisms, which may exacerbate a variety of the physiologic features that characterize asthma but do not involve infiltration of the lower airways with inflammatory cells.",

We have thoroughly described the phenomenon and have determined that it does not involve the influx of inflammatory cells into the lower airways. Other mechanisms, such as the activation of resident airway cells and enhanced upper airway inflammation should be further explored. The number of people who experience persistent airway obstruction postexacerbation represent a significant proportion of asthmatic patients (25%), and these people should be followed up postexacerbation as the continuation of uncontrolled asthma will lead to a significant loss of quality of life.",
