In some cases, intermediates of this reaction, 2-(1-haloethenyl)pyrroles A, were isolated and under the same conditions transformed to 2-ethynylpyrroles. 1, 2, 5 The development of expedient synthesis of ethynylfurans represents a challenge for heterocyclic chemistry, because such motifs are frequently met in bioactive molecules and natural products, 14, 15 for example, in inhibitors of mast cell b-triptase, 16e18 SARS coronavirus main protease, 19 leukocyte calcium uptake, 20 lipoxygenase, 21 and carlina oxide (a natural polyacetylene from Carlina acaulis) with potent antitrypanosomal and antimicrobial activities. 22 They also are prospective building blocks for the synthesis of more complex biomolecules due to the rich chemistry of the triple bond and the furan ring, especially in their combination. 23e31 A logic development of previous ethynylation of pyrroles with haloacetylenes 1,2,12,13,32 might be translation of this methodology to the furan compounds. In this line, just one short note that 2-(2furyl)pyrrole 33 was capable of the ethynylating by haloacetylenes was reported. It was mentioned inter alia that the cross-coupled products with furan ethynylated moiety were isolated in small yields (4e5%).",

Thus, it was found that a naturally abundant furan compound, menthofuran, is readily crosscoupled with haloacetylenes under transition metal-free conditions in the solid Al 2 O 3 powder at room temperature to give 2ethynyl derivatives in up to 88% yield. In contrast to the ethynylation of pyrroles under similar conditions, the reaction studied involves reversible [4 \u00fe 2]-cycloaddition of the furan ring to form the isolable intermediated cycloadducts, which then further transform to the acetylenic derivatives. The novel menthofuran derivatives, thus obtained, represent promising bioactive compounds and rewarding precursors for drug design.",
