The model incorporates information on human movement within the following metapopulation structure: [5] where < , < , < A , < B and < are the susceptible, exposed, documented infected, undocumented infected and total population in city i. Note that we define patients with symptoms severe enough to be confirmed as documented infected individuals; whereas other infected persons are defined as undocumented infected individuals. We specified a rate parameter, \u03b2, for the transmission rate due to documented infected individuals. The transmission rate due to undocumented individuals is reduced by a factor . In addition, is the fraction of documented infections, Z is the average latency period and D is the average duration of infection. The effective reproduction number ( 4 ) is calculated as 4 = + (1 \u2212 ) (see Supplementary Appendix for details). Spatial coupling within the model is represented by the daily number of people traveling from city j to city i ( <3 ) and a multiplicative factor, , which is greater than 1 to reflect underreporting of human movements (see below). We assume that individuals in the < A group do not move between cities. A similar metapopulation model has been used to forecast the spatial transmission of influenza in the United States 7 .",

Chunyun is a period of 40 days -15 days before and 25 days after the Lunar New Year -during which there are high rates of travel within China. To estimate human mobility during the 2020 Chunyun period, which began January 10, we aligned the 2018 Tencent data based on relative timing to the Spring Festival. For example, we used mobility data from February 1, 2018 to represent human movement on January 10, 2020, as these days were similarly distant from the Lunar New Year. During the 2018 Chunyun, a total of 1.73 billion travel events were captured in the Tencent data; whereas 2.97 billions trips are reported 8 .

These control measures included travel restrictions imposed between major cities and Wuhan; self-quarantine and contact precautions advocated by the government; and more available rapid testing for infection confirmation [12] [13] . These measures along with changes in medical careseeking behaviour due to increased awareness of the virus and increased personal protective behavior (e.g. wearing of facemasks, social distancing, self-isolation when sick), likely altered the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak after January 23. To quantify these differences, we re-estimated the system parameters using the metapopulation model-inference framework and city-level daily cases reported between January 24 and February 8. As inter-city mobility was restricted, we set = 0. In addition, to represent reduced person-to-person contact and increased infection detection, we updated the initial priors for and to [0.2, 1.0] and [0.2, 1.0], respectively (see Supplementary Appendix for more details).",

Figure 1 shows simulations of reported cases generated using the best-fitting model parameter estimates. The distribution of these stochastic simulations captures the range of observed cases well. In addition, the best-fitting model captures the spread of COVID-19 to other cities in China ( Figure S9 ). Our median estimate of the overall 4 is 2.23 (95% CI: 1.77\u22123.00), indicating a high capacity for sustained transmission of COVID-19 (Table 1) . This finding aligns with other recent estimates of the reproductive number for this time period 6, [12] [13] [14] . In addition, the median estimates for the latent and infectious periods are approximately 3.77 and 3.45 days, respectively. Further, we find that, during January 10-23, only 14% (95% CI: 9-26%) of total infections in China were reported. This estimate reveals a very high rate of undocumented infections: 86%. This finding is independently corroborated by the infection rate among foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan (see Supplementary Appendix). These undocumented infections are estimated to have been half as contagious per individual as reported infections (\u00b5 = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.44 -0.69). Other model fittings made using alternate values of ! and \\X] produced similar parameter estimates ( Figure S10 ).",
