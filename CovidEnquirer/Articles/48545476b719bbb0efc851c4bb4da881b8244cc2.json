Firstly, this study was designed as a feasibility 96 study which means that although the modified Jackson score was an efficacy outcome measure, 97 we did not formally pre-specify it as the primary outcome measure. Secondly, due to the nature 98 of the intervention we were unable to blind participants and investigators to the allocated 99 intervention and a future study aiming to replicate these results should explore the option of 100 sham rhinothermy. Finally, the small sample size means that although this study showed 101 clinically and statistically significant results it can be considered relatively 'fragile', in that the 102 modified Jackson score would only need to change in a small number of participants who 103 received the rhinothermy intervention to match the placebo group for our conclusions to be 104 different. [34, 35] A formal fragility index cannot be calculated for the change in modified Jackson 105 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 participants used the myAIRVO 2 device for two hours per day on average throughout the 5 day 124 treatment period, and for 2.6 hours on the days of use. As instructed not all participants used the 125 device late in the treatment course once their symptoms had improved. Around a third of 126 participants reduced the flow rate to 25 or 30L/min suggesting that giving participants the option 127 of reducing the flow from the initial 35L/min, or having a lower starting flow is worthwhile. The 128 difference between the randomised groups was observed within 24 hours, so that the efficacy of 129 single dose regimens or sessions over a two to three day period, which may enhance its 130 implementation in clinical practice, will be worth further study. However, while alternative 131 rhinothermy regimens will need to be assessed, our study findings suggest that the regimen used 132 in this feasibility study should also be used in future RCTs. 133 Our study has also been informative in terms of the likely number of participants required in a 135 RCT. We have estimated the change in modified Jackson score which denotes substantial 136 clinical benefit to be a five unit change. Based on the largest SD of 6.6 (from the upper CI of the 137 Jackson score at Day 5), a sample size of 38 per arm would give 90% power, alpha 5%, to detect 138 a difference in symptom score equal to the substantial clinical benefit at day 5. Assuming a 10% 139 drop out rate, derived from the lower confidence interval of our estimate, this would require a total 140 of 126 participants in an RCT investigating three randomised treatments, comprising the current 141 rhinothermy regimen, a sham rhinothermy regimen and vitamin C. 142 143 A specific respiratory virus was identified by PCR in 16/30 (53%) of participants, with the majority 144 being rhinovirus. This respiratory virus detection rate was comparable to previous studies, which 145 report detection rates between 43 and 64%.[36-38] We found no difference in the treatment 146 effect between participants who were nasal swab PCR positive or negative, indicating that our 147 findings are generalisable to symptomatic common colds, and not restricted to those with positive 148 virus detection. It also suggests that the efficacy may also relate to non-temperature related anti-149 viral effects, such as humidification of the airways and enhanced mucociliary clearance. This study shows that an RCT of rhinothermy with the modified myAIRVO 2 device is feasible, 154 that rhinothermy is well tolerated, and that the estimated change denoting substantial clinical 155 benefit for the modified Jackson score is a five unit change. Compared with vitamin C, 156 rhinothermy improves symptoms of the common cold by at least the substantial clinical benefit 157 threshold between days 3 and 5. These efficacy findings now require replication in a larger study 158 of common colds. Investigation of the efficacy of rhinothermy in the treatment of influenza is also 159 a priority, in view of the temperature-sensitivity of influenza viruses, [39] [40] [41] Results: In all 30/79 (38%, 95% CI 27 to 50) of potential participants screened for eligibility 44 were randomised. Rhinothermy was well tolerated and all randomised participants completed 45 the study (100%, 95% CI 88 to 100%). The reduction from baseline in the modified Jackson 46 score was significantly greater with rhinothermy compared with control at days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, 47 with the maximum difference at day 4 (-6.4, 95%CI -9.4 to -3.3). The substantial clinical benefit 48 threshold for modified Jackson score was a 5 unit change. 49",

Firstly, this study was designed as a feasibility 391 study which means that although the modified Jackson score was a pre-specified efficacy 392 outcome measure, we did not formally specify it as the primary outcome measure. Secondly, due 393 to the nature of the intervention we were unable to blind participants and investigators to the 394 allocated intervention and a future study aiming to replicate these results should explore the 395 option of sham rhinothermy. Finally, the small sample size means that although this study 396 showed clinically and statistically significant results it can be considered relatively 'fragile', in that 397 the modified Jackson score would only need to change in a small number of participants who 398 received the rhinothermy intervention to match the control group for our conclusions to be 399 different. [33, 34] A formal fragility index cannot be calculated for the change in modified Jackson 400 score as it is not a dichotomous variable. The complete follow-up of all participants helps protect 401 against this fragility, however due to the above limitations a larger replication study is required. 402 participants used the myAIRVO 2 device for two hours per day on average throughout the 5 day 419 treatment period, and for 2.6 hours on the days of use. As instructed not all participants used the 420 device late in the treatment course once their symptoms had improved. Around a third of 421 participants reduced the flow rate to 25 or 30L/min suggesting that giving participants the option 422 of reducing the flow from the initial 35L/min, or having a lower starting flow is worthwhile. The 423 difference between the randomised groups was observed within 24 hours, so that the efficacy of 424 single dose regimens or sessions over a two to three day period, which may enhance its 425 implementation in clinical practice, will be worth further study. However, while alternative 426 rhinothermy regimens will need to be assessed, our study findings suggest that the regimen used 427 in this feasibility study should also be used in future RCTs. 428",

Therefore, an 312 estimate of the MCID used the scores of 25 participants, 16 in the rhinothermy group and nine 313 in the control group. We recognised post-hoc that the threshold \"a lot better\" corresponded to an 314 estimate of substantial clinical benefit rather than the MCID [31,32] and so have estimated the 315 change which represents substantial clinical benefit. The change from baseline modified 316 Jackson score which had the best sensitivity and specificity for the participants stating that they 317 felt a lot better was between 5 and 6 units on the modified Jackson Score on days 4 and 5 318 (Table 4 ).

Participants in this study were recruited primarily through social media so the 393 results should be generalisable to people in the community with symptoms of the common cold. 394 395 Three main limitations apply to these results. Firstly, this study was designed as a feasibility 396 study which means that although the modified Jackson score was a pre-specified efficacy 397 outcome measure, we did not formally specify it as the primary outcome measure. Secondly, 398 due to the nature of the intervention we were unable to blind participants and investigators to 399 the allocated intervention and a future study aiming to replicate these results should explore the 400 option of sham rhinothermy. Finally, the small sample size means that although this study found 401 benefits for the new treatment the results are relatively 'fragile', in that the modified Jackson 402 score would only need to change in a small number of participants who received the 403 rhinothermy intervention to match the control group for our conclusions to be different.

As instructed, not all participants used 425 the device late in the treatment course once their symptoms had improved. Around a third of 426 participants reduced the flow rate to 25 or 30L/min suggesting that giving participants the option 427 of reducing the flow from the initial 35L/min, or having a lower starting flow, is worthwhile. 428",

The pragmatic regimen used in this study was based on available in vitro and in vivo 112 studies. A temperature of 41 O C was used as although there is a dose dependent reduction in 113 HRV replication up to temperatures of 43 to 45 O C,[16,17] temperatures of around 43 O C are prone 114 to cause minor mucosal burns.[17] Two hour sessions were used due to the evidence that the 115 shortest duration of inhibition of HRV replication is observed with 60 rather than 30 minutes of 116 hyperthermia in vitro.[17] Repeat sessions were administered over five days, as in vitro the effect 117 of hyperthermia is transient, with HRV yields from hyperthermic treated cells reaching baseline 118 levels within 24 to 48 hours.[16] 119 This rhinothermy regimen was well tolerated. Participants reported it was comfortable, and easy 121 to use and apply, although somewhat noisy.

Participants reported it was comfortable, and easy 421 to use and apply, although somewhat noisy.
