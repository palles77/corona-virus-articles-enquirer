In this study, we developed a recombinant fowlpox virus (rFPV) vaccine expressing the IBV S1 gene and chicken interleukin-18 gene (IL-18), rFPV-S1/IL18. Recombinant plasmid pSY-S1/IL18 was constructed by cloning chicken IL-18 into fowlpox virus transfer plasmid containing S1 gene and transfected into the chicken embryo fibroblasts cell pre-infected with S-FPV-017 to generate rFPV-S1/IL18. Expression of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by RT-PCR and IFA. We also constructed the recombinant fowlpox virus rFPV-S1 without IL-18. One-day-old chickens were vaccinated by wing-web puncture with the two rFPVs, and the induced humoral and cellular responses were evaluated. There was a significant difference in ELISA antibody levels (P < 0.05) elicited by either rFPV-S1 or rFPV-S1/IL18. The ratios of CD4 + to CD8 + in chickens immunized with rFPV-S1/IL18 were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in those immunized with rFPV-S1. All chickens immunized with rFPV-S1/IL18 were completely protected (20/20) after challenge with the virulent IBV HN99 strain 43 days after immunization, while only 15 out of 20 of the chickens immunized with the rFPV-S1 were protected. Our results show that the protective efficacy of the rFPV-S1 vaccine could be enhanced significantly by simultaneous expression of IL-18.",

It is still a major health problem in the chicken industry worldwide. Vaccination to control IB has been practiced for over half a century [1] [2] [3] . Such conventional vaccines, although generally effective, do have some disadvantages. Attenuated vaccines, which generally induce longlasting immunity, have a risk of insufficient attenuation and/or genetic instability [4] . The limitations of inactivated vaccines include high manufacturing costs and lack of long-term immunity. Thus, developing a vaccine to control this disease with higher efficacy and fewer side effects is highly desirable.",

IBV was first detected in China in 1972, and numerous nephropathogenic strains have been isolated since 1982 [8] . In spite of extensive vaccine use, IBV outbreaks remain frequent in China. Infected broilers show clinical signs of depression, dehydration, and polyuria, with swelling of the kidneys and severe urate deposition, which results in death. Infected breeders or layers have decreased egg production. The HN99 nephropathogenic strain of IBV was isolated from one of a group of approximately 3-week-old broilers in Henan Province suffering from depression, dehydration, and polyuria. Because it is the most prevalent strain in China, we developed a recombinant anti-IBV vaccine based on this virus.",

FPV has been developed as an effective live viral vector, successfully expressing protective foreign genes from various poultry pathogens, including Newcastle disease virus, avian influenza virus, IBV, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, and Marek's disease virus. Fowlpox virus has a number of advantages as a vector, but its side effects cannot be ignored: its effects on weight gain and on immune function [13] . It has been confirmed that some cytokines can relieve these side effects, and some of these cytokines are effective immunomodulators in animal models or clinical trials. Cytokine adjuvants have been widely used to promote the induction of immune responses and enhance the immunoprotective effects of vaccines against bacteria, viruses, or parasites [14] . IL-18 is one possible option, and is known as interferon-gamma (IFN-\u2425)-inducing factor because of its ability to stimulate T helper 1 (Th1) cells to secrete IFN-\u2425 [15] . Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to construct two recombinant fowlpox viruses (rFPVs) expressing the S1 gene of IBV and co-expressing the S1 gene of IBV and the chicken IL-18 gene, which was included to overcome the FPV-induced inhibition of weight gain, and increase the efficacy of immunization.",

Parental fowlpox virus S-FPV-017 infected CEF cells were used as an infection control. The viruses were collected after cytopathic effect (CPE) appeared, and rFPVs were screened for beta-galactosidase activity in the presence of 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl \u2424-d-galactoside (X-gal) (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). After eight rounds of blue plaque purification, the two rFPVs were obtained and cultured in CEF cells.

The result showed that vaccination with the rFPV-S1/IL18 can induce stronger immune responses than vaccination with rFPV-S1. Compared to some earlier descriptions of FPV recombinants expressing IBV S1 with and without cytokines [17, 22] , different cytokines, vector, and IBV strains were used. Wang et al. [22] reported that their constructed recombinant fowlpox virus expressing the S1 protein was indicated by the man-ifested, relatively mild clinical signs of disease, decreased titers of recovered challenge virus, and less severe histologic changes of the tracheas in virulent IBV Mass 41-challenged chickens previously receiving rFPV-S1 as compared with parental fowl poxvirus (FPV)-vaccinated control birds. A fowlpox virus (rFPV-S1-ChIFN\u2425) co-expressing the S1 gene and the chicken type II interferon gene provided the strongest protection against an IBV LX4 virus challenge, and chickens in the rFPV-S1-ChIFN\u2425 group eliminated virus more quickly and decreased the presence of viral antigen more significantly in renal tissue when compared to those of the rFPV-S1 [17] . Our results show that the rFPV-S1/IL18 vaccinated group displayed significantly increased weight gain relative to the rFPV-S1 group, and the protective efficacy of the rFPV-S1 vaccine could be enhanced significantly by simultaneous expression of IL-18. Compared to Wang et al. [22] reported, Wang et al. [17] and our results showed the protective efficacy of the rFPV-S1 vaccine could be enhanced significantly by simultaneous expression of a cytokine and normal weight gain in vaccinated chickens. In our study, all chickens immunized with rFPV-S1/IL18 were completely protected (20/20) after challenge with the virulent IBV HN99 strain, 15 of 16 of the chickens immunized with rFPV-S1-ChIFN\u2425 constructed by Wang et al. [17] were protected, whether these different survival proportions are due to different cytokines and challenge with different IBV strains is further studying.",

Our evaluation by flow cytometry of the Tcell concentrations in peripheral blood revealed that the ratios of CD4 + to CD8 + cells in chickens immunized with rFPV-S1/IL18 were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in those immunized with rFPV-S1, and vaccination with rFPV-S1/IL18 significantly increased the percentages of CD3 + , CD4 + CD3 + and CD8 + CD3 + T-lymphocytes compared with the percentage in the groups inoculated with rFPV-S1 (P < 0.05).

CD4 + T-cell responses may increase the proliferation, maturation and functional activity of CD8 + CTL, provide increased help for B-cells and directly produce anti-viral cytokines. In this study the number of the CD8 + T-lymphocytes in peripheral blood of chickens in rFPV-S1/IL18 group was significantly higher than that of chickens in rFPV-S1 group (data not shown), which may explain the better clinical protection of rFPV-S1/IL18 as CD8 + T-cells is cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that play a major role in clearing or controlling viral infections [30] , this is consistent with those found by Wang et al. [17] . The increased numbers of T-cells would have a limiting effect on viral replication and lead to better protection [31] . In addition, the percentages of CD3 + , CD4 + CD3 + and CD8 + CD3 + T-lymphocyte subgroups in chickens immunized with rFPV-S1 were significantly higher than those in the S-FPV-017-immunized chickens (P < 0.05), similar results were also reported by Shen et al.

The ratios of CD4 + to CD8 + cells in chickens immunized with rFPV-S1 were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in those immunized with S-FPV-017. The effect of S1 expression on the T-cell ratios may be FPV expressing S1 protein replicates in the epidermal layer of the skin. At day 42 after immunization, the percentages of CD4 + CD3 + and CD8 + CD3 + T-lymphocytes in three vaccinated groups were all higher than that at day 7 after immunization ( Fig. 5 ).
