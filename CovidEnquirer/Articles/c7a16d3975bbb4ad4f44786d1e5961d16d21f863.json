All 24 cats were euthanized with a median survival time of 14 days (range, 2-115) from onset of clinical signs.

            "text": "F eline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is the most common infectious disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in cats, typically affecting animals <3 years of age from multicat environments. [1] [2] [3] [4] Although the pathogenesis is complex and incompletely understood, the causative agent, FIP virus (FIPV), is a monocyte/ macrophage-tropic mutant of the ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). 5, 6 Virus-laden macrophages trigger a marked inflammatory reaction, resulting in multisystemic pyogranulomatous vasculitis. With time, the histiocytic population is replaced by a lymphoplasmacytic population. Two forms of the disease are recognized, the effusive or \"wet\" form, associated with serous exudates into the abdominal cavity, and the noneffusive or \"dry\" form, associated with granulomatous parenchymal lesions. 7 Approximately 38% of cases with the noneffusive form and 5% of cases with the effusive form of FIP are presented with involvement of the CNS, in which typical neurologic deficits are reported, including seizures, ataxia, and head tilt. 4, 5, 7, 8 The inevitable mortality of CNS FIP necessitates prompt diagnosis to avoid prolonged efforts at unsuccessful treatment and inappropriate client expectations. However, antemortem definitive diagnosis of the disease remains challenging because FIPV is serologically and genetically indistinguishable from FECV, and hence, further diagnostic tools are needed. 1 Within the CNS, FIPV-induced pyogranulomatous vasculitis predominantly affects the leptomeninges, ependyma, and choroid plexuses. 2, 5, 6, 9 Such lesions would be expected to generate distinctive changes on MRI of the CNS. The MRI findings in 4 cats with neurologic FIP were previously reported. 5 Ventricular dilatation was detected in 3 cats, with periventricular contrast enhancement in all cats in which contrast agents were administered. In a subsequent study, 8 cats with histologically confirmed neurologic FIP and MRI were reported. 10 In 3 cases, MRI was reported to be normal. In the remaining 5 cases, abnormalities included cerebellar herniation (3), ventricular dilatation (4) , and meningeal and ependymal contrast enhancement (5) . Therefore, although MRI abnormalities have been documented in cats with neurologic FIP, case numbers are limited. Furthermore, advances in MRI technology and availability since these prior publications have made it an increasingly sensitive and accessible diagnostic tool. The aim of our study was to collate a larger number of cases to further evaluate neurologic FIP, with particular emphasis on assessing and comparing the clinical presentation with the MRI features and pathologic lesions.",

The evaluation of MRI included the CNS region imaged and all surrounding structures. The MR images were evaluated by a board-certified neurologist (EB) and a neurology resident in training (AC) blinded to the clinical signs. All studies included both spin echo or turbo spin echo T1-weighted (T1W: repetition time [TR] 461-992 ms; echo time [TE] 15-20 ms; slice thickness, 2.5-5.0 mm), and spin echo or turbo spin echo T2-weighted (T2W: TR 2,500-9,000 ms; TE 80-119 ms; slice thickness, 2.5-5.0 mm) images. T1-weighted (T1W) images were acquired before and after IV administration of gadolinium contrast material (0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol a or gadopentetate dimeglumine b ). A group of these studies included T2-weighted fluid attenuation inversion recovery (T2W-FLAIR: TR 5,600-35,000 ms; TE 90-119 ms; slice thickness, 2.5-5.5 mm) images and T2* gradient recall echo (T2*: TR 840-1,021 ms; TE 80-119 ms; slice thickness, 4.0-5.0 mm) images. Findings were categorized as mild (focal regions of contrast enhancement of meninges, ependyma, or both without ventriculomegaly, mass effect, or dilatation of the central canal), moderate (mild ventriculomegaly with minimal mass effect and multifocal regions of contrast enhancement), or severe (marked ventriculomegaly with moderate-to-severe mass effect, dilatation of the central canal, and multifocal to generalized contrast enhancement). To provide a quantitative measure of the extent of ventriculomegaly, the maximum height of the fourth ventricle was recorded as a percentage of the caudal fossa brain height (cerebellum and brainstem) on midline sagittal T2W images (Fig. 1) . The maximum height of the lateral ventricles at the level of the interthalamic adhesion was recorded on transverse T2W images as a percentage of the brain height at that level (Fig. 2) .

Pathologic lesions were categorized as mild (focal inflammatory infiltrates), moderate (mild ventriculomegaly with multifocal infiltrates), or severe (marked ventriculomegaly with extensive infiltrates). pathologic nystagmus, and vestibular ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain often identified marked enlargement of the fourth ventricle causing dorsal compression of the brainstem and ventral compression of the cerebellum. This compression may compromise the vestibular nuclei, vestibulocerebellum, or both, thus accounting for the high frequency of clinical vestibular deficits. Various mechanisms may contribute to abnormal mentation, including brainstem compression compromising the ascending reticular activating system, increased intracranial pressure causing diffuse forebrain compromise, or neuropathic pain secondary to syringomyelia. Tetraparesis may have resulted from compression of the descending upper motor neuron tracts as they traverse the brainstem and cervical spinal cord. Seven cats experienced acute deterioration to nonambulatory status before referral. Potential underlying mechanisms for this acute deterioration may include increased intracranial pressure leading to herniation or progression of systemic disease. Only 1 cat (4.2%) was reported to have had a possible seizure episode. However, a study of 55 cats with neurologic FIP reported the presence of seizures in 14 (25.5%) and found that seizures were significantly more frequent in cats with marked extension of the inflammatory lesions to the forebrain. 8 Histopathologic analysis of the brains of the cats in our study indentified inflammatory infiltrates extending into the brainstem parenchyma in 5 cats, and periventricular infiltration primarily around the lateral ventricles in 13 cats, with no clinically relevant extension into the cortical areas. The absence of cortical involvement may account for the much lower frequency of seizures in our case series.",

However, evaluation of meningeal contrast enhancement in MRI studies in the cat can be challenging, particularly in the absence of associated parenchymal lesions. The assessors of the MR images in our study were blinded to the clinical signs of the cats, but they were not blinded to the final diagnosis of neurologic FIP. In contrast, the previous study included various types of feline meningoencephalitis that may not be associated with vascular and superficially orientated inflammation, and thus, the authors may have been more cautious in identifying pathologic contrast enhancement of the meninges on MRI. 10 Quantitative measures of the degree of contrast enhancement would be very useful to overcome this source of bias.",

The cats that were presented with a T3-L3 myelopathy had neurologic deficits confined to the pelvic limbs, meningeal contrast enhancement of the spinal cord and, where imaged, the brainstem on MRI, and histopathologic lesions that consisted of pyogranulomatous or lymphoplasmacytic infiltration into the meninges of the spinal cord and brainstem. Cats with central vestibular syndrome or multifocal CNS disease typically had more severe neurologic deficits and more extensive MRI lesions with ventriculomegaly, mass effect, and more diffuse contrast enhancement affecting the ependyma, choroid plexuses, and meninges of the caudal cranial fossa that often extended to the third and lateral ventricles. Furthermore, the height of the lateral and fourth ventricles increased with worsening histopathologic lesion severity. Thus, the severity of the clinical presentation reflected the severity of the lesions detected by MRI and histopathology. Although the diagnostic utility of the proposed lesion grading schemes requires validation, the results of our case series suggest that MRI is a both sensitive tool to identify vasculitis and secondary ventriculomegaly in neurologic FIP as well as an accurate indicator of the extent of the histopathologic changes. By evaluating the severity of the clinical presentation with the extent of the MRI abnormalities, a prediction of the likely concurrent histopathologic lesions can be made.",

This finding may suggest that the severity of neurologic deficits on presentation does not substantially influence the decision for euthanasia, but rather that the major factor in the decision is the positive diagnosis of FIP and its associated grave prognosis. 1, 4, 5, 11 Enlargement of the ventricular system was detected in 20 cats, usually involving multiple ventricles and the mesencephalic aqueduct. Marked vasculitis with secondary accumulation of inflammatory exudate within the mesencephalic aqueduct and lateral apertures obstructs normal CSF flow leading to increased intraventricular pressure and secondary ventricular distension. 12 The FLAIR sequences identified T2W hyperintensities surrounding the lateral ventricles in 15 cats. These imaging characteristics are consistent with interstitial edema, the formation of which has been attributed to transependymal absorption of CSF that follows the pressure gradient from the ventricle to the parenchyma. 12 As previously reported, the distribution of ependymal contrast enhancement appeared to correspond to the degree of ventricular enlargement, with the third and fourth ventricles most commonly affected. 5 Magnetic resonance imaging identified intramedullary T2W hyperintensity, consistent with syringomyelia, within the cervical spinal cord in 17 cats. However, syringomyelia was not observed on postmortem examination, presumably due to failure to extensively examine the cervical spinal cord. Syringomyelia has been detected in cats with neurologic FIP previously and is presumed to result from the extensive inflammatory cell infiltrates obstructing CSF flow along the central canal of the spinal cord, which may be exacerbated by increased intracranial pressure altering normal CSF dynamics. 13, 14 In a case series of 4 cats with syringomyelia of various etiologies, each was found to have ventriculomegaly with evidence of mass effect including midline shift and foramen magnum herniation. 13 Syringomyelia also has been reported in a cat with multiple intracranial meningiomas, 15 and in a cat with severe congenital hydrocephalus. 16 Thus, identification of syringomyelia in a cat should alert the clinician to the possibility of intracranial pathology causing increased intracranial pressure.",

[17] [18] [19] In our series, failure of CSF signal suppression, or hyperintense CSF, was apparent in 6 of the 19 cats for which FLAIR sequences were available. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was performed in 3 of these 6 cats, and each was found to have a markedly increased total protein concentration (2.52, 3.68 and 9.89 g/L). A similar elevation in CSF protein concentration was reported in 8 FIPaffected cats in another study, which found that a concentration of >2 g/L was a distinctive feature of FIP, and no other inflammatory CNS disease group had a mean CSF protein concentration >1 g/L. 9 Ten of the 11 cats in our study in which CSF protein concentrations were measured had concentrations >2 g/L. Interestingly, the 3 cats with the highest total protein concentration (29.9, 28.8 and 25.5 g/L) had full CSF signal suppression on FLAIR. Therefore, CSF signal suppression in FLAIR sequences does not exclude the presence of increased CSF protein concentrations. Other potential causes of CSF hyperintensity in FLAIR sequences include both pathologic changes such as ventricular hemorrhage, ischemia, or ventricular metastatic disease, and nonpathologic factors such as inhalation of 100% oxygen, chemical shift artifact, or magnetic susceptibility artifact. 17, 18 Further studies are warranted to ascertain which other factors affect CSF suppression, or lack thereof, in cats with FIP.",

These findings are in contrast to the limited abnormalities detected on peripheral blood analysis, including increased serum globulin concentration in 18% of cases, mild neutrophilia in 14%, and mild leukocytosis in 9%. Neutrophilic pleocytosis was the most common CSF cytologic finding, with some cats having lymphocytic or mixed pleocytosis. The cats with lymphocytic and mixed pleocytosis may reflect a more chronic stage of the disease, in which lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates begin to replace histiocytes and neutrophils. These results contradict the findings of a previous study, in which CSF was normal in a proportion of cases with confirmed neurologic FIP. 5 This difference may be explained by sample collection at an earlier stage of the disease pathogenesis, the presence of focal lesions, or both in the previous study. 20 Additionally, sample collection site may influence results because lumbar CSF samples typically have a higher protein concentration and decreased white blood cell count compared with samples collected from the cerebellomedullary cistern. 21 Neurologic FIP typically causes diffuse vasculitis affecting the brain and spinal cord, but cats may present with neurologic deficits suggestive of a more localized disease process. One cat in our series that was presented with a T3-L3 myelopathy underwent spinal cord MRI only, with no imaging of the brain. Postmortem examination of this cat, however, identified a lymphoplasmacytic meningoencephalomyelitis with secondary ventriculomegaly. In a study of 205 cats with spinal cord disease, 33 were diagnosed with FIP. 2 Of these, only 8 were presented with neurologic deficits indicative of brain involvement in addition to the spinal cord disease, but 29 underwent subsequent histopathologic analysis of the brain, and lesions consistent with FIP were detected in all 29. Thus, cats presented with a T3-L3 myelopathy often have concurrent brain pathology and may progress clinically to show neurologic deficits consistent with forebrain or brainstem localization.",

In dogs, ventriculomegaly is considered to be asymptomatic with normal intraventricular pressure, whereas hydrocephalus is a clinically relevant increase in CSF volume compromising the surrounding brain parenchyma. 12, 22 In a recent study, a ventricle:brain index >0.6 together with dorsal deviation of the body of the corpus callosum, periventricular edema, thinning of the sulci, subarachnoid space, or both, and disruption of the internal capsule adjacent to the caudate nucleus was reported to be associated with clinically relevant dilatation of the lateral cerebral ventricles because of increased intraventricular pressure. 12 A similar study has not been performed in cats, and hence, MRI features to distinguish ventriculomegaly from hydrocephalus have not been determined. For consistency, we refer to distension of the ventricles as ventriculomegaly, but acknowledge that a clinically relevant, pathologic increase in CSF volume causing compromise of the surrounding parenchyma is likely to be present in many FIP-affected cats. The finding that increased ventricular size was associated with a more severe clinical presentation and more extensive histopathologic changes supports the likely pathologic relevance of ventriculomegaly. Further studies including a comparison between ventricular dimensions in normal and FIP-affected cats would be valuable. Finally, MRI identified ventriculomegaly in 20 cats, whereas postmortem examination detected ventriculomegaly in only 10 cats, suggesting that high-field MRI may have higher sensitivity for detecting pathologic changes in the ventricular dimensions.",

            "text": "Limitations of our study include its multi-institutional and retrospective nature, leading to variability in the clinical and pathologic information available as well as the precise MRI sequences obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging and pathologic lesion severity were graded to facilitate analysis of the cases and to group them according to the extent of pathology. However, the grading schemes used have not been validated and further large-scale, prospective studies are needed to fully evaluate the extent and severity of MRI findings and pathologic lesions. A difference in grade of MRI and histopathologic findings was identified in 1 cat, in which euthanasia was performed 6 days after MRI. Although lesion progression could have occurred during this time period, the difference in grading may have arisen from lesion variation among CNS locations and emphasizes the need to standardize histopathologic examination across cases. Confirmation of FIP was primarily based on histopathologic identification of consistent lesions. Feline infectious peritonitis is distinguished pathologically from other infectious causes of meningitis and encephalitis, such as feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, rabies, pseudorabies, Toxoplasma gondii, and Cryptococcus neoformans, by the presence of vascular and superficially orientated pyogranulomatous inflammation in the absence of visible fungal and bacterial pathogens. 5, 8 The gross and histologic lesions of FIP are typical, and a thorough postmortem examination with adequate histopathologic examination of diseased tissues can be an accurate way to confirm a diagnosis. 1, 8 Should there be an element of uncertainty in the pathologist's interpretation of the lesions, immunohistochemistry to detect viral antigen can aid in obtaining a definitive diagnosis. 1, 24 Although a definitive diagnosis of FIP was made in each case in our series based on characteristic histopathologic findings, immunohistochemistry was performed in 10 cats, which confirmed the presence of viral antigen within the CNS of all 10 cats.",
