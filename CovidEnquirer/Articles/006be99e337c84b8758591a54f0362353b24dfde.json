CRP, a homopentamer composed of nonglycosylated 24-kD subunits associated by noncovalent forces (24, 29), is a plasma protein whose rate of synthesis by the hepatocyte increases by several hundredfold or more during the systemic acute phase response to tissue injury (39). In studies of the synthesis and secretion of CRP by rabbit primary hepatocyte cultures prepared from animals stimulated in vivo to undergo the acute phase response, the half-time for secretion of newly synthesized CRP was found to decrease markedly from as much as 18 h in control hepatocytes to as little as 75 min in cells from acute phase animals (47), while the kinetics of albumin secretion determined in the same cultures, were rapid (half-time of 30-45 min) and did not vary during the acute phase response. Results of studies in which a fusion gene consisting of the rabbit CRP gene linked to the mouse metallothionein promoter was transfected into HeLa cells (29) indicated that the default rate of rabbit CRP secretion was rapid and suggested that changes in its transit time were due to its specific retention within unstimulated rabbit hepatocytes, rather than to facilitated export in cells from stimulated animals. However, CRP does not contain carboxy-terminal sequences reported to result in ER retention (29). Further, assembly of CRP does not appear to be rate-limiting, since in control as well as stimulated cells >90% of antigenically detectable CRP labeled in a 10-min pulse is pentameric as judged by its size on gel filtration, its differential reactivity with structure-specific antibodies, and its ability to bind phosphocholine (29, 46, 47, and our unpublished observations).",

Kinetic and equilibrium binding studies identify a high affinity CRP binding site which is present in hepatic rough microsomes from normal rabbits, but is not detected in microsomes from animals undergoing the acute phase response. Finally, nitrocellulose blots probed with radiolabeled CRP demonstrate a 60-kD band, distinct from BiP, which is detected in extracts of control rough microsomes, but not in Golgi fractions or rough microsomes from stimulated animals.

            "text": "Abstract. The half-time for secretion of the plasma protein C-reactive protein (CRP) by the hepatocyte decreases markedly in association with its increased synthesis during the acute phase response to tissue injury (Macintyre, S., D. Samols, and I. . J. Biol. Chem. 260:4169-4173) . In studies in which subcellular fractions were prepared from cells incubated under pulse-chase conditions, CRP was found to be preferentially retained within the ER of normal hepatocytes, but secreted relatively efficiently in cells prepared from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On the basis of the detergent-dependency of specific binding of radiolabeled CRP, as well as EM visualization of biotinylated CRP identified with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, CRP was found to bind to the lumenal surface of permeabilized rough microsomes, while no binding was detected in Golgi fractions. As judged by both kinetic and equilibrium bind-ing studies, rough microsomes from control rabbits were found to have two classes of specific binding sites for CRP; a high affinity site (Kd = 1 nM, Bmax = 1 pmol CRP/mg microsomal protein) as well as a much lower affinity (I~ = 140 nM) site. In contrast, only the lower affinity class was detected in microsomes isolated from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On nitrocellulose blots probed with radiolabeled CRP a 60-kD protein, distinct from BiP, was detected in extracts of rough microsomes isolated from control rabbits, but not in Golgi fractions or rough microsomes from stimulated animals. These findings correlate with previous observations of changes in secretion kinetics of CRP and are consistent with the hypothesis that the intracellular sorting of CRP could be rerouted by downregulation of a specific ER binding site during the acute phase response. p ROTEINS that are cotranslationally inserted into the lumen of the ER during their synthesis have varied destinations, including the plasma membrane, the extracellular space, lysosomes, elements of the Golgi apparatus, and the ER itself. Thus, the need for specific delivery of a diversity of proteins to multiple locations represents a formidable task in protein trafficking. The mechanism by which newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are specifically targeted to lysosomes has been well-characterized (reviewed in 37) . Considerable progress has also been made in elucidating the role of the carboxy-terminal KDEL (reviewed in 57), or homologous (2, 3, 26) , sequence in the continuous retrieval of soluble ER resident proteins from downstream compartments to their proper location within the lumen of the ER (42, 57, 74) . More recently, several reports have begun to identify sequence and/or structural motifs of certain transmembrane proteins which allow for their specific localization to the membranes of the ER (32, 54) and Golgi elements (52, 55, 70) .",

In a process referred to as quality control (reviewed in 31, 35, 60) , proteins destined for exit from the ER appear to require a degree of proper folding and/or assembly, possibly facilitated by molecular chaperones such as BiP (grp78) (reviewed in 23) , in order to be released from the ER. Proteins which do not meet these criteria are subject to degradation within the ER (14, 16, 77 and reviewed in 36). In the case of the T-cell antigen receptor, the processes of ER retention, assembly of subunits, and degradation of improperly assembled complexes appear to be tightly coupled (9, 10) .",

The homogenate was centrifuged as usual at I1,000 g for 10 min and the resulting postmitochondrial supernate was centrifuged at 143,000 g for 60 rain. The distribution of added radioactivity in the initial pellet, the microsomal pellet, and the soluble supernate was determined by counting in a Nuclear Chicago model 1085 gamma counter.

Adsorption of both CRP and albumin to the 11,000 g pellet and to total microsomes was found to be minimal (range of 2.8-3.9 % of input) in all four cultures and notably less than previously reported for exocrine pancreas (65) , possibly due to the more dilute homogenate in this procedure, Leakage of pulse-labeled proteins was considerable, presumably owing to the relatively harsh conditions of homogenization found to be required to disrupt the hepatocytes. Leakage of albumin ranged from 56 to 71% and did not differ in cultures from control compared to stimulated animals. Interestingly, while leakage of CRP determined in the two cultures from stimulated cells was 52% and 58%, leakage from control cultures was less (31 and 38%), consistent with our previous work suggesting that CRP may be preferentially retained within normal hepatocytes and that retention is decreased during the acute phase response (30) . In the pulse-chase studies, leakage of individual proteins was determined from the percentage of radioactivity present in the 11,000 g supernate which remained soluble following the 143,000 g centrifugation and no corrections were made for adsorption of leaked proteins. In a typical preparation, 10 culture dishes (5 x 107 cells) yielded ,',,1.5 rag protein in total microsomes, 400 t~g in rough microsomes, 180 #g in smooth microsomes, and 150/~g in Golgi fractions.",

In addition to CRP and albumin, transferrin was also studied since it has a relatively long transit time of ,~120 rain (68). Results of subcellular fractionation of pulse-chase labeled hepatocytes prepared from an animal exhibiting a minimal response to turpentine injection (animal ~) (serum CRP level 16/~g/ml; in vitro secretion rate of 7.1 ng CRP/10 ~ cells/h) are shown in Fig. 1 . After a 10-rain pulse with [3sS]methionine, the majority of each radiolabeled protein was, as expected, recovered in the ERderived fractions. After 75 rain of chase, little albumin remained in any of the fractions, consistent with its half-time for secretion of ~ 30 min (47). The amount of labeled transferrin decreased substantially and was about equally distributed between the rough and smooth ER fractions, with a small amount in the Golgi fraction where its migration was somewhat slower, presumably due to the acquisition of sialic acid residues. In contrast, the majority of radiolabeled CRP was found to persist within the ER fractions after the 75-min chase period. Quantitation of the labeled proteins in the gel Figure L Chase of pulse-labeled proteins from subcellulax fractions. Cells prepared from an animal manifesting a minimal response to inflammatory stimulus (serum CRP 16/~g/ml), were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min and subcellulax fractions were prepared from 10 dishes immediately after the pulse and from 10 dishes after 75 min of chase. Radiolabeled albumin, transferrin, and CRP were specifically immunoprecipitated from portions of lysates of fractions and were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Panels are from portions of three gels used to analyze the immunoprecipitates of the three proteins present in rough (R), smooth (S), and Golgi (G) fractions. To achieve comparable autoradiographic results, the proportions of lysates used for immunoprecipitation of individual proteins (CRP = 40 %, albumin = 20%, transferrin = 10%) was designed to account for differences in methionine composition, relative rates of synthesis, and intracellulax transit times (see Materials and Methods for details). Exposure times were 3 d for transferrin and 5 d for albumin and CRP. For comparison, chase kinetics of radiolabeled proteins in cells prepared from an animal showed a greater CRP response to turpentine injection (Table I , animal #2) (serum CRP of 64/xg/ml; in vitro secretion rate of 22 ng CRP/10 ~ cells/h). While there was little difference (compared to animal #1) for albumin (82 % of ER cpm lost during the 75-min chase), or for transferrin (50 % increase in chased transferrin from 40 to 59%), a threefold increase in chase of radiolabeled CRP from 12 to 35 % was observed. This finding corroborates our previous observations of a decrease in transit time for CRP during the course of the acute phase response (47) , and is in agreement with the conclusions of most other workers that the rate-limiting step in the secretion of secretory proteins is exit from the ER (22, 44, 64, 78) .",

To investigate this possibility, the concentrations of CRP and albumin were determined in isolated subcellular fractions employing specific RIAs. In each experiment, the finding that the concentrations of CRP and albumin in the rough fraction are very similar to those in the smooth microsomal fraction is consistent with the concept that these fractions are both derived from a continuous membranous network comprising the endoplasmic reticulum. In the minimally responsive animal (Table I , Animal #1), the mean ratios of CRP/ albumin within the rough and smooth fractions were 13 and 12%, respectively. By contrast, the ratio within the Golgi fractions was only 0.8%, in good agreement with the observed ratio of rates of secretion of CRP and albumin in this animal, CRP being 1.1% that of albumin. Thus, upon arrival in the Golgi, the kinetic differential between the two proteins has been overcome. In contrast, the relatively high ratios of CRP/albumin found in the microsomal fractions are in agreement with our earlier proposal (47) that newly synthesized CRP equilibrates within an intracellular pool of preexisting CRP molecules, and identify the site of this pool as the ER.",

Since such interactions would be expected to occur on the lumenal surface of the vesicles, we took advantage of previous work demonstrating that isolated microsomes can be effectively permeabilized by low concentrations of deoxycholate (38, 58) . Fig. 2 a demonstrates the effect of increasing concentrations of DOC on the specific binding of labeled CRP to total microsomes. While little binding was seen in the absence of DOC, detectable specific binding of CRP increased with increasing concentrations of detergent, reaching a maximum value at 0.035 % DOC. The observed relationship between DOC concentration and binding activity is in excellent agreement with previous comprehensive studies demonstrating the relationship between DOC concentration and induced permeability of rough microsomes to macromolecules (38) . In order to maximize the ability to detect CRP binding yet minimize release of phospholipids (38) , subsequent binding studies were carried out in 0,035% DOC. Binding of CRP to permeabilized microsomes was found to be calcium-dependent (Fig. 2 b) , with maximum binding occurring at calcium concentrations in excess of 0.5 mM (in the presence of 1.0% BSA). This finding is not unexpected, in that CRP is known to bind calcium (25) and many of its other recognized binding properties are calcium-dependent (6) .

In two experiments, mean specific binding of mI-CRP (ng bound/mg microsomal protein) was found to be 20.5 for rough microsomes, 14.8 for smooth microsomes, and was not detected in Golgi-derived microsomes. Thus, the localization of the binding activity to fractions derived from the ER correlates with the observation that the ER is the compartment in which CRP is retained as judged by the results of the pulse-chase and steady-state distribution experiments described above. In subsequent studies, purified rough microsomes were used in order to avoid the possibility of heterogeneity in the smooth ER fractions.",

As seen in Fig. 3 b, DOC-permeabflized rough microsomes incubated with biotin-BSA did not accumulate any peroxidase reaction product when compared to untreated rough microsomes (Fig. 3 a) . These findings indicate the absence of detectable nonspecific interaction between biotinylated proteins and permeabilized rough microsomes, as well as the absence of components within rough microsomes which either contain, or are capable of binding biotin. Examination of rough microsomes not treated with DOC before sequential incubation with biotin-CRP and peroxidase-conjugated Streptavidin revealed occasional microsomes which appeared to accumulate reaction product within the vesicle (Fig. 3 c) . This may have been due to a small incidence of vesicles sufficiently damaged during preparation to allow entry of CRP and may correlate with the very low levels of binding seen in the absence of DOC (Fig. 1) . As indicated by the arrow (Fig. 3 c) , some degree of diffusion of reaction product was apparent, as evidenced by the presence of electron dense material in the portion of a negative vesicle which is adjacent to a positive vesicle.

Phosphocholine was found to inhibit the binding of tEsI-CRE but concentrations necessary for competition equivalent to that by CRP were 100-fold greater (Fig. 4 d) , indicating it is unlikely that the binding site is simply phosphocholine itself. The effect of trypsin on the binding of CRP to microsomes also supports this conclusion. CRP binding to permeabilized microsomes that had been pretreated with trypsin, then quenched with PMSF, was found to be only 20 % of the binding to permeabilized microsomes which had been preincubated with trypsin which had been premixed with PMSF (data not shown).

Nonspecific binding was determined from an incubation containing labeled and unlabeled CRP added simultaneously. Analysis (KINETIC [49] ) of the dissociation kinetics indicated the presence of Saturation binding studies were carried out employing increasing amounts of labeled CRP in paired incubations plus and minus at least a 60-fold excess of unlabeled CRP (see Materials and Methods). Studies of permeabilized rough microsomes from unstimulated rabbits suggested saturable binding was approached at concentrations of labeled CRP in excess of 20 nM (Fig. 6 a, inset) , and allowed for estimation of a mean Kd (as judged by concentration of CRP at half saturation) of ,o3 nM. Nonlinear curve riving analysis (LIGAND [53] ) again indicated a two-site fit was statistically superior (P < 0.02) (Fig. 6 a) . The resulting association constants were 1.14 x +0.83 x 108 and 7.29 x +2. For comparison, saturation binding studies were also performed with permeabilized rough microsomes prepared from two animals stimulated in vivo to undergo the acute phase response (Fig. 6 b) . In this case, a single fit model resulted in an estimated Kd of 1.5 X 10 -7 M, corresponding to the lower affinity site seen with microsomes from unstimulated animals, and the higher affinity site was not demonstrable. These data correlate with our previous observations that the half-time for secretion of CRP is markedly longer in normal hepatocytes than in cells from animals undergoing CRP-binding activity present in total lysate (Fig. 7 d, \" Total\") was found to partition into the aqueous phase (Fig. 7 d, \"Aqueous\") indicating that the 60 kD material is likely not a transmembrane protein. Together, these findings suggest that the 60 kD CRP-binding site is a lumenal ER protein, possibly localized to the ER via interaction with the KDEL or a homologous retrieval system (57). were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS gel. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the gel was stained with Coomassie blue (,4).

When the same blot was subsequently probed with anti-BiP (Fig. 7 c) , a different band, 80 kD in size, was identified in equivalent amounts in the rough microsomal samples, but greatly diminished in the Golgi sample, findings that are consistent with the expected size and distribution of BiP and indicate that BiP expression does not change significantly during the acute phase response. Thus, the expression of the 60-kD CRP-binding band, a protein distinct from BiP, correlates well with the results of the binding of CRP to permeabilized microsomal subfractions, as judged by both subcellular localization as well as a decrease in activity in microsomes from stimulated animals. When rough microsomes were extracted with Triton X-114 (12) , virtually all of the 60-kD",

The major findings of the present studies are as follows. (a) The site of CRP retention is, not surprisingly, the endoplasmic reticulum. (b) Specific, detergent-dependent binding of CRP to microsomes is limited to ER-derived subcellular fractions. (c) Specific binding of CRP is greatly diminished in samples from animals undergoing the acute phase response and appears to involve an ER protein distinct from BiP.

However, several lines of evidence indicate that the high affinity microsomal binding site is not simply exposed phosphocholine. The estimated affinity for CRP is ~500fold greater than that for free phosphocholine (1). The high affinity site was not detected in Golgi fractions or rough microsomes from stimulated animals. Furthermore, no specific binding of CRP was found with permeabilized rough microsomes prepared from mice (data not shown), an unusual species in which CRP synthesis is minimal and does not change substantially during the acute phase response (66) .

            "text": "Nevertheless, we did observe weak inhibition by phosphocholine of the interaction between CRP and rough microsomes. One possible explanation for this finding would be that phosphocholine is a constituent of the rough microsomal binding site for CRP and the greater apparent affinity of this site for CRP is due to additional protein structure. Such a phenomenon would be analogous to the observation that the affinity of the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor for mannose-6-phosphate expressed in lysosomal enzymes is substantially greater than that for free mannose-6phosphate (28) . Alternatively, phosphocholine could be exerting an allosteric effect, since it is known that the interaction of phosphocholine with CRP results in a conformational change in CRP (80) . Thus, phosphocholine added to the assay could bind to free CRP and result in a conformational change which lessens the ability of CRP to bind, via another site, to the rough microsomal membrane. Indeed, the observed K~ of '~ 3/~M (Fig. 4 d) for phosphocholine in the binding assay is in agreement with what would be expected for the interaction between CRP and free phosphocholine, having a K~ of 5 #M (5). The lack of inhibition of microsomal binding by human CRP suggests that the effect of phosphocholine on the binding of rabbit CRP to rough microsomes is due to an allosteric effect of phosphocholine on the CRP molecule, although it remains possible that phosphocholine is a constituent of the binding site and that additional protein structure increases the affinity for rabbit CRP, but also sterically interferes with the interaction of human CRP with the phosphocholine moiety of the microsomal binding site. Our conclusion that the expression of the ER binding site for CRP is regulated during inflammatory states is of significance, since it implies a physiological role for the binding. Thus, it is important to confirm that the observed changes in kinetics of secretion of CRP (47) are not simply the result of saturation of a constitutively expressed binding site. This is particularly true since endogenous CRP, if present in rough microsomes from stimulated animals, could have effectively decreased the true specific activity of the labeled CRP. This circumstance would preferentially obscure detection of higher affinity binding sites. However, Table II demonstrates that the Sepharose 2B chromatography step used in the preparation of permeabilized microsomes effectively removed endogenous CRP from stimulated samples. The maximum amount of endogenous CRP which could have been in the incubations was only 25 pg, representing only 0.1% of the amount of labeled CRP included in the incubations containing the lowest concentration of labeled CRP. Finally, the differences seen in CRP binding by nitrocellulose blot analysis of unstimulated versus stimulated microsomes reflect a direct assessment of binding site expression, since endogenous CRP is both dissociated and physically separated from the 60-kD CRP-binding band.",

What might be the function of such a regulated retention mechanism for CRP? On the basis of previous findings (47) as well as the pulse-chase data and in vitro binding assays reported here, it is apparent that effective retention of CRP within the ER occurs preferentially in hepatocytes synthesizing CRP at relatively low rates. As a result, the cell accumulates a small pool of CRP within the ER. Since the retention (or retrieval) of CRP is calcium-dependent, this pool would be rapidly mobilizable in response to transient decreases in local calcium concentration resulting, for example, from signal transduction during the early acute phase response. While there is controversy regarding the effects of calcium ionophores on the fate of ER resident proteins (11, 43) , local calcium fluxes within the ER appear to be of great potential physiologic significance (61) . Whether a rapid secretory burst of intracellular CRP might play a role in the early acute phase response is presently unknown.",
