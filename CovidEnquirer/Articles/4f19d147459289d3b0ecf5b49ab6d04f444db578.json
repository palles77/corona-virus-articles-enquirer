In this report, ribavirin was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in five different cell types of animal or human origin at therapeutically achievable concentrations. Since clinical anti-SARS-CoV activity of type I interferons or ribavirin is limited, we investigated the combination of IFN-b and ribavirin. Determination of the virus yield indicated highly synergistic anti-SARS-CoV action of the combination suggesting the consideration of ribavirin plus IFN-b for the treatment of SARS.",

Starting concentrations were diluted in ratios of 1:2.

EC 50 , EC 75 , and EC 95 of ribavirin, IFN-b or their combination in infected human intestinal cell lines Caco2 and CL-14 were determined by measurement of infectious virus titre. For example, in Caco2 cells infected with SARS-CoV FFM1 strain (MOI 0.01), ribavirin concentrations inhibiting virus production in combination with IFN-b were at least 10-fold lower when compared with cultures receiving single treatment with ribavirin. Inhibitory concentrations of IFN-b were 50-to 2000-fold decreased in combination relative to single treatment with IFN-b.

We observed about 90% viral replication inhibition at concentrations up to 24 lg/ml ribavirin which is at reasonable therapeutical plasma levels after an intravenous dose of 1000 mg ribavirin [2] . This may be insufficient to improve clinical symptoms. In concordance, randomised clinical trials showed low dose (400-600 mg/day) ribavirin to be ineffective [15] . On the other hand, the most recently published study reported that ribavirin reduced the viral load in 5 of the 8 patients [16] . Moreover, this study suggested that the peak inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and IL-8) levels concurred with or after the peak viral load and preceded or concurred with the maximum pulmonary infiltrates. Thus, it is probable that viral replication leads to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines that, together with other factors, contribute to disease progression. These clinical findings together with the observation of antiviral activity in different SARS-CoV-infected cell lines encourage the testing of treatment strategies using ribavirin in combination with other antiviral agents such as IFNs to increase inhibitory effects on virus replication and subsequently minimised immunopathological damages.",

However, both studies reported solely on CPE formation in Vero cells. Our results demonstrate that both drugs act highly synergistically in combination on formation of CPE as well as on production of infectious virus titres in two human cell lines.
