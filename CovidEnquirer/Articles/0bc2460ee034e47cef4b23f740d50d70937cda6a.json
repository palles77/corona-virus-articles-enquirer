The normal concentrations of anti-rotavirus antibodies in mares' milk and mares' and foals' serum over the first 10 weeks post-partum were measured using lgA, lgG and rotavirus serotype-specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. Experimental infection of the foals with serotype 3 equine rotavirus produced a rapid, serotype-specific response which peaked 10 days after infection and a slower heterotypic response which peaked 32 days later. In contrast, vaccination of the mares with an inactivated, adjuvanted serotype 6 bovine rotavirus produced a heterotypic response similar to that of the homotypic response in both serum and milk, although the predominant response in serum was IgG, while in milk it was lgA. These results suggest that non serotype-restricted passive protection of foals against rotavirus may be achieved by parenteral vaccination of mares.",

Surveys have implicated rotavirus as the cause of diarrhoea in between 10% and 60% of cases in foals (Conner and Darlington, 1980; Gillespie, et al., 1984; Herbst et al., 1987; Dwyer et al., 1988; Browning et al., unpublished data) . Effective vaccination against rotavirus has been achieved routinely in cattle, by passive immunisation through dam vaccination ( Snodgrass, 1986; McNulty and Logan, 1987 ) . However, the protection is mediated by IgGl, the dominant immunoglobulin in the ruminant milk (Fahey et al. 1981 ) , which is derived by selective transfer from the circulating pool, rather than by local synthesis in the mammary gland as in monogastric animals like the horse (Lascelles, 1977) , Rotavirus vaccination has not been assessed in mares.",

After washing, a lysate of MA104 cells infected with rotavirus, diluted 1:4, was added and incubated at 37:C for 3 hours. Human rotavirus DS-1 was used in the serotype 2 specific assay, rhesus rotavirus in the serotype 3 assay and bovine rotavirus UK in the serotype 6 assay (Hoshino et al.. 1984) . This was followed by a five-step, two-fold dilution series of each sample, performed in duplicate: the sixth row on the plate contained diluent alone and served as a negative control. After 1 hour at 37C, the plates were washed and a serotype 2-specific neutralising monoclonal antibody (2FI, Shaw et al., 1987) . a biotinylated serotype 3-specific neutralising monoclonal antibody (4F8, Shaw et al.. 1986 ) or a biotinylated serotype 6-specific neutralising monoclonal antibod~ ( U K/ 7 Snodgrass et al., 1990 ) was added to each of the respective assays.

( 1978 ) examined the effect of vaccination on IgA in mares' milk during the first 3 days post partum and showed a response to oral and intraductal inoculation, but not to parenteral inoculation. However it is unlikely that the mares had been exposed to the antigen, dinitrophenylated type III pneumococcus, prior to the study. In studies with transmissible gastroenteritis virus, Saifand Bohl ( 1982 ) have shown that intramammary vaccination of seronegative sows produces primarily an lgG response in milk, while in a seropositive sow the response was predominantly lgA. Sail ( 1985 ) has also shown that intramuscular inoculation ofa seropositive sow with attenuated rotavirus at 4 days post partum was able to induce a neutralising antibody response in milk. Svennerholm et al. (1980) similarly demonstrated that milk secretory IgA can be boosted in Pakistani women with a single subcutaneous inoculation of cholera vaccine, but that a primary response could not be induced in the milk of Swedish women. Thus, the response of mares to a single inoculation with a rotavirus vaccine is consistent with responses observed in other monogastric animals upon parenteral vaccination with an antigen which they have encountered enterically.",

Such a heterotypic response in experienced animals has been noted in other species (Brussow et al., 1988; Saif, 1985 ) and enables the use of a single serotype vaccine to protect against multiple serotypes. Heterotypic responses are minimal in naive animals (Snodgrass et al., 1984 , Estes et al., 1989 and serotypic diversity has been a barrier to successful active vaccination against rotavirus (Chanock et al., 1988) .

The comparison of the kinetics of the ability of the foals' sera to block a cross-reactive epitope on both serotype 3 and 6 rotaviruses provides some indication of the spectrum of the epitope-blocking assay, and also demonstrates the complexity of the humoral response to rotaviruses. It is apparent from a comparison of the parallel assays that the epitope-blocking assay, not unexpectedly, detects not only antibody able to bind to the monoclonal antibody's target epitope, but also that binding to the domain surrounding that epitope. Otherwise, the two assays would be similar, and that using the serotype 3 rotavirus target would not correspond to the homologous assay so closely. However, the slight peak observed at day 10 using a serotype 6 target suggests a specific response to the cross-reactive epitope, albeit much less pronounced than that to homotypic",
