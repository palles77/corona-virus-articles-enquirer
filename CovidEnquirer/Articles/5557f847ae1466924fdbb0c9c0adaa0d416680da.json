However, to date, no commercial vaccine is available. In this study, structural proteins of MERS-CoV were expressed in silkworm larvae and Bm5 cells for the development of vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV and diagnostic methods. The spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV lacking its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (S\u0394TM) was secreted into the hemolymph of silkworm larvae using a bombyxin signal peptide and purified using affinity chromatography. The purified S\u0394TM forms small nanoparticles as well as the full-length S protein and has the ability to bind human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which is a receptor of MERS-CoV. These results indicate that bioactive S\u0394TM was expressed in silkworm larvae. To produce MERS-CoV-like particles (MERS-CoV-LPs), the coexpression of spike proteins was performed in Bm5 cells and envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins secreted E and M proteins extracellularly, suggesting that MERS-CoV-LPs may be formed. However, this S protein was not displayed on virus-like particles (VLPs) even though E and M proteins were secreted into the culture supernatant. By surfactant treatment and mechanical extrusion using S protein-or three structural protein-expressing Bm5 cells, S protein-displaying nanovesicles with diameters of approximately 100-200 nm were prepared and confirmed by immuno-TEM. The mechanical extrusion method is favorable for obtaining uniform recombinant protein-displaying nanovesicles from cultured cells. The purified S\u0394TM from silkworm larvae and S protein-displaying nanovesicles from Bm5 cells may lead to the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines against MERS-CoV and the diagnostic detection of MERS-CoV. DDP4, to inhibit the infection of cells by MERS-CoV (Corti et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2014) . In addition, the S protein and its receptor-binding domain are regarded as promising targets for the development of vaccines against MERS-CoV, even though no vaccine against MERS-CoV is yet commercially available (Ma et al., 2014a, b). The M protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) forms enveloped virus-like particles (VLPs) when",

The S protein, which is a class I fusion protein, is responsible for viral entry into target cells through receptor binding. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) is known to be its receptor. During viral infection, S protein is processed into S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain, and the S2 subunit is required for the membrane fusion of MERS-CoV. Therefore, the S protein is one of the targets for the development of MERS-CoV therapeutics (Du et al., 2017) . Some neutralizing antibodies have been developed against the receptor-binding domain of S protein, which blocks the interaction of S protein with it is coexpressed with the E or N protein in insect cells and mammalian cells (Mortola and Roy, 2004; Siu et al., 2008) . Likewise, VLPs of MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV-LPs) were produced in insect cells by the coexpression of the S, E and M proteins (Wang et al., 2017) . The immunization Rhesus macaques with S protein-displaying MERS-CoV-LPs induced the production of receptor-binding domain-specific antibodies and virusneutralizing antibodies, leading to Th1-mediated immunity. This result indicates that S protein-displaying VLPs are a promising tool for vaccination against MERS-CoV.",

To connect the tag sequences, genes encoding the E and M proteins were amplified using the E and M primer sets (Table 1) , respectively. The genes encoding the E and M proteins had FLAG tag and PA tag sequences at the 3\u2032-end. The gene encoding the S protein was amplified by PCR using Bx-myc-S-F and the S-R primer set (Table 1 ). The S protein gene had sequences encoding the bombyxin signal peptide and c-Myc tag instead of that encoding its native signal peptide. To express S\u0394TM, which does not have its native transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, the gene encoding S\u0394TM was amplified by PCR using the bx-myc-S-F and S\u0394TM-R primer set (Table 1 ).

The gene encoding the M protein was amplified by PCR using the M-F and M-PA-R primer set (Table 1) . Each amplified gene was inserted into the pFastbac1 vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific K. K.). Each resulting recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BmDH10Bac bacmid (Motohashi et al., 2005) , and white colonies were selected. A recombinant BmNPV bacmid (BmNPV/S or BmNPV/S\u0394TM) containing each gene was extracted from a white colony, and the insertion of each gene into the BmNPV bacmid was checked by PCR using the M13-F and M13-R primer set (Table 1) . Each recombinant BmNPV was prepared by the transfection of each constructed BmNPV bacmid into Bm5 cells. For transfection, several micrograms of recombinant BmNPV bacmid was transfected into Bm5 cells with Jet PEI reagent (Polyplus Transfection, New York, NY, USA). After several days, the culture supernatant was collected, followed by titer-up. To express recombinant proteins in Bm5 cells, Bm5 cells were infected with recombinant BmNPVs at an M.O.I. of 1.

This result indicates that S\u0394TM was secreted into the hemolymph because of the removal of its C-terminal domains. S\u0394TM was purified from the hemolymph using affinity chromatography. Three main bands were observed in the elution fraction by CBB staining and by western blotting (Fig. 2B) . These results indicate that these three bands came from expressed S\u0394TM. The estimated molecular weight of expressed S\u0394TM is approximately 141.9 kDa, and S\u0394TM has 25 putative N-glycosylation sites. However, how many N-glycosylation sites in the S protein are Nglycosylated is unknown. These results suggest that one band over 150 kDa may be intact S\u03bfTM and that two bands below 150 kDa may be processed S\u0394TM. From a larva, 8.3 \u03bcg of S\u0394TM was purified. Small particles were observed in the elution fraction by TEM in Fig. 2C , indicating that S\u0394TM can form such small particles even in the absence of its C-terminal domains. Using Sf-9 cells Coleman et al. (2014) also reported the formation of the particles consisting of the expressed S proteins. The purified S\u0394TM showed specific binding to human DPP4 (Fig. 2D) by ELISA, not to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is a receptor for S protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

SNVs and ENVs were partially purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 4) . The S protein in SNVs prepared from S protein-expressing Bm5 cells was observed in fractions 3 to 6, while the S protein in ENVs was observed in fractions 5 to 9 (Fig. 4A) . The S, E and M proteins in SNVs were observed in fractions 3 to 6, while those in ENVs were observed in fractions 5 to 8 (Fig. 4B) . The morphology of SNVs and ENVs was investigated by immuno-TEM (Fig. 5) . In SNVs and ENVs, gold nanoparticles were observed on the surfaces of nanovesicles. The SNVs were broken and shapeless ( Fig. 5A and B) , while the ENVs were clear and round (Fig. 5C and D) . SNVs had a broad peak distribution (Fig. 5E) , but ENVs showed a sharp peak at approximately 140 nm (Fig. 5F ). This result indicates that ENVs were more uniform than SNVs and that the mechanical extrusion method is favorable for the preparation of nanovesicles displaying the S protein from insect cells. In addition, the coexpression of the M and E proteins with the S protein did not have any influence on the morphology and size of SNVs and ENVs.",

            "text": "In this study, S protein-displaying MERS-CoV-LPs composed of the S, E and M proteins were not generated in Bm5 cells and silkworm larvae. The S protein was expressed by the fusion of the bombyxin signal peptide from B. mori instead of its native peptide (Fig. 1) . Therefore, we tried to express full-length S protein with its native signal peptide for the preparation of S protein-displaying MERS-CoV-LPs but failed. In mammalian cells, the endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal (ERRS) of the S protein of coronaviruses, which occurs in the cytoplasmic domain at the C-terminus of the protein, is required for the accumulation of S protein in the postmedial Golgi compartment and its return to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), followed by the budding of coronaviruses and VLPs (McBride et al., 2007; Ujike et al., 2016) . We also coexpressed the S protein fused with the signal peptide and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of ERGIC-53 from B. mori, which is a non-glycosylated type I membrane protein of 53 kDa resided in ERGIC, instead of its native domains with the E and M proteins in Bm5 cells and silkworm larvae. However, S protein-displaying MERS-CoV-LPs were not produced. On the other hands, it was previously reported by Wang et al. that the successful production of S protein-displaying MERS-CoV-LPs composed of the S, E and M proteins in Sf-9 cells (Wang et al., 2017) . It is unknown why Bm5 cells and silkworms cannot produce S protein-displaying MERS-CoV-LPs by the coexpression of S, E and M proteins. The localization of S protein in Bm5 cells may clarify why S protein was not displayed on particles composing of M and E proteins.",

These methods allow the easy and efficient production of virus-like nanovesicles and exosome-mimic vesicles from mammalian cells for vaccine development and drug delivery systems. In this study, we successfully produced three recombinant proteins, S, E and M, of MERS-CoV-displaying SNVs and ENVs by surfactant treatment or mechanical extrusion, respectively, which were VLP mimetic nanovesicles. For the application of these VLP mimetic nanovesicles composed of multiple structural proteins of viruses, their properties, including stability, morphology and functionality, should be investigated in detail.",
