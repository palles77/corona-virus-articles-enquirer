It is easy to recognize the outbreaks of infectious hepatitis by the water route because of their explo sive nature and characteristic symptomatology. Most enteric viruses, how ever, cause a wide variety of symptoms so that scattered cases of acute illness would probably have too varied symptoms to be attributed to a single etiologic agent. Also, the presence of small numbers of viruses in water may result only in an inapparent infection in a person coming in contact with contaminated water. The virus may then multiply in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of that person who may, in turn, act as an effective carrier and transmit the virus to others. The development of acute disease in these contact persons will be epidemiologically classified as \"transmitted by direct contact\" rather than being waterborne. Intensive surveillance is, therefore, necessary to determine the \"real\" cause of an outbreak.",

In case of Shigella, however, 10-100 cells are enough to cause dysentery. Similarly, the infectious dose of protozoan cysts and helminth ova is very low, perhaps 10. The symptoms of helminth infections are dose-related, however. Currently available information suggests that even a single virus particle may produce infection under favorable condi tions.

This level may still be of great public health concern, depending on how the effluent is going to be used. As efficient as it may be, sewage treatment processes cannot be ex pected to remove/inactivate all of the pathogens present. Disinfection of treated wastewater is, therefore, practiced to ensure further inactivation of microorganisms. In the United States, chlorination is practically the only process used for disinfection of wastewater. Unfortunately, however, there is a great variability in resistance to chlorine among different microorga nisms. It is generally agreed that bacteria are much more susceptible to chlorine than are viruses and protozoan cysts.

Climate will control two important factors in determining viral and bacterial survival: temperature and rainfall. The survival of microorganisms is greatly prolonged at low temperature; below 4\u00b0 C they can survive for months or even years [18] . At higher temperatures, inactivation or dieoff is fairly rapid. In the case of bacteria, and probably viruses, the dieoff rate is approximately doubled with each 10\u00b0 C rise in temperature between 5\u00b0 C and 30\u00b0 C [22] . Above 30\u00b0 C temperature is probably the dominant factor determining virus survival time.

The surface charge of a virus is influenced primarily by ionization of the carboxyl and amino groups on the outer surface of the virion protein capsid; and at neutral pH, most viruses are negatively charged. Soils also tend to be generally electronega tive at neutral pH; therefore, virus adsorption is not favored due to repul sion of the two negatively charged surfaces. However, if the pH of the surrounding medium is lowered, protonation causes decreased ionization of virion carboxyl groups and increased ionization of amino groups. As a re sult, viruses become less electronegative or even electropositive at lower pH levels.",

At lower pH levels, the viruses may be electropositive but the soils are still electronegative, thereby resulting in electrostatic attraction and increased adsorption. The relationship between virus adsorption and pH is not clearcut, however, because of many complicating factors. The pH of the soil, as conventionally measured, does not reflect necessarily the pH at the surface of soil colloidal particles such as clays. Various soil components (clay, sand, oxides of aluminum and iron) display different isoelectric points. There is also a lack of information on the isoelectric points of more than 100 viruses that occur in wastewater or groundwater. So far, we know that the isoelectric point varies with virus type and strain [38] [39] .",

In batch adsorption studies with a variety of viruses and nine soils by Goyal and Gerba [32] , pH was found to be the single most important soil factor influencing adsorption. Soils having a saturated pH less than 5 were the best adsorbers. Studies by Sobsey et al.

In studies by Duboise et al. [40] with cores of sandy forest soil receiving poliovirus in sewage effluent at various pH levels between 5.5 and 9.0, virus retention was best at pH 5.5, and the release and migration of retained viruses by subsequent distilled water applications was lower from the cores that re ceived sewage effluent having lower pH values.

Rainwater, being of lower conductivity than sewage effluents, may thus lead to reduced viral and bacterial adsorption or to desorption with the subse quent redistribution of these organisms within the soil profile. This phenom enon was well demonstrated via soil core studies under controlled laboratory conditions [8, 34, 40, 41] . Landry et al. [43] showed that virus penetration was more extensive in rainwater-rinsed cores than in wastewater-rinsed cores. Moreover, the desorbed viruses may readsorb at greater depths. Heavy rainfall might then remobilize soil-bound viruses with the potential contam ination of groundwater supplies [10] . However, it now appears that the ability of rainwater to release viruses depends on the soil type, the release being more pronounced in sandy than in clay soils [34] . The elution pattern also depends on the virus type and strain. For example, poliovirus 3 and echovirus 6 were mobilized by artificial rainwater, whereas echovirus 1 was not affected. The elution pattern of the reference strain of poliovirus 1 differed from that of field and mutant strains [9] .",

Several surveys have indicated that rainfall and well depth are related to microbial groundwater quality. Studies in Washington indicated that shallow drinking water wells average medium coliform values of 8 MPN per 100 ml with an average depth of 9.4 m (31 ft), while deep wells with an average depth of 153.3 m (503 ft) average 4 MPN per 100 ml [15] . It was also observed that virtually all bacterial con tamination coincided with the periods of heaviest rainfall. Brooks and Cech [44] observed in rural eastern Texas that practically all dug wells with depths of 50 ft (15 m) or less were positive for either fecal coliforms or fecal strep tococci. While presence of fecal bacteria was much less common in deeper wells, some wells as deep as 250 ft (80 m) were positive. Increased levels of bacterial contamination of drinking well water after periods of rain have been noted in several studies [23] [24] [25] 45] . In one study, it was noted that while an increase in coliform bacteria appears almost immediately after periods of heavy rainfall in shallow wells, in deeper wells the increase did not occur until 2 weeks later [46] .

Such conditions as flow rate, hydraulic loading, and application frequency may all influence the extent of virus migration through soils. Vaughn et al. [51] reported that infiltration rate greatly influenced poliovirus removal in a groundwater re charge system where tertiary effluent was applied to a coarse sand-fine gravel soil. Recharge at 75 to 100 cm per hour resulted in considerable virus movement into groundwater while at two lower recharge rates, 6 and 0.5-1.0 cm per hour, there was considerably less virus movement. At the lower infiltration rates, the surface mat of sewage solids that formed on the soil surface may have contributed to the greater virus removals observed. Lance et al. [8] found that poliovirus type 1 removal was not affected by infiltration rates in the range of 15 to 55 cm per day. More recently Lance and Gerba [52] found that increasing flow rates from 0.6 to 1.2 m per day resulted in increased movement of viruses down the column. However, there was no further increase in virus movement at flow rates up to 12 m per day.",

Survival times among different types of bacteria and viruses vary greatly and are difficult to assess without studying each type individ ually. In most cases, it appears that 2 to 3 months is sufficient for reduction of pathogenic to negligible numbers once they have been applied to the soil, although survival times as long as 5 years have been reported [59] .

Allowing soils in rapid-infiltration systems to pe riodically dry and become aerated between wastewater applications en hances virus inactivation. The effects of both drying and aerobic microbial activity may contribute to virus inactivation under these conditions. In stud ies on the mechanisms of virus inactivation in soils, Yeager and O'Brien [55] found that the loss of poliovirus infectivity in moist and dried soils resulted from irreversible damage to the virus particles, including (1) dis sociation of viral genomes and capsids, and (2) degradation of viral RNA. In both moist and dried nonsterile soils, viral RNA was released from cap sids and found in a degraded form. In dried, sterile soils, viral RNA was released but remained largely as intact molecules. Viral capsid components were not readily recoverable from drying soils due to irreversible binding, but they could be recovered as empty capsids from moist soils. Further experiments with dried viruses showed that their capsids became isoelectrically altered. The results of these studies suggest that poliovirus and perhaps other viruses are inactivated by different mechanisms in moist and drying soils.",

Similar observations were made by Lefler and Kott [42] with regard to poliovirus type 1 and bacteriophage f2 survival in a sandy soil in Israel. Yeager and O'Brien [55] found that Coxsackie virus Bl inactivation rates in sandy loam soils suspended in riverwater, groundwater, and septic wastewater increased as temperatures were increased from 4 to 37\u00b0 C. In pilotscale outdoor studies on poliovirus persistence on vegetables and in soils irrigated with sewage effluent in Cincinnati, Ohio, Larkin et al. [69] and Tierney et al. [70] found that 99 percent inactivation in soils took about 2 months during the winter months and only 2 to 3 days in the warm summer months of June and July. In a field study by Hurst et al. [57] on virus survival and movement in a rapid-infiltration system for wastewater, the rate of inactivation of indigenous viruses was greater in the fall than in the winter, possibly due in part to the effects of higher temperatures in the former season.",

In addition, the longer survival time of enteric organisms after inoculation into sterilized soil as compared to unsterilized soil found by a number of workers [59] indicates that antagonism is an important fac tor. Tate [73] observed that the protozoan population of a muck soil in creased dramatically after addition of E. coli and suggested that soil protozoa could play a significant role in the decline of these organisms in these soils. Since it is evident that enteric bacteria are capable of utilizing nutrients found in nature, it could be argued that competition by the natural soil microflora is in large part responsible for their eventual disappearance from the soil.",

It is also possible that under some conditions they could regrow in groundwater if sufficient nutrients are present. E. coli bac teria have been found to survive and even multiply on organic matter filtered out from lake water during underground recharge projects in Israel [78] . In some areas of Israel surface water during the rainy season is used to recharge the underground water supply. During those parts of the year when there is an increased need for water the same wells transformed to pumping wells. During such projects it was found that although the water pumped under ground contained less than 2 coliforms per 100 mL after chlorination, the repumped water contained counts as high as 10 5 -10 6 per 100 mL, which persisted for long periods of time after the initiation of pumping. Subsequent studies showed that organic matter that had accumulated in the sand around the well casing enabled the regrowth of the few remaining coliforms. Also of interest was the finding that so long as recharge continued, the bacteria did not multiply; it was only during the period between recharge and pump ing that growth occurred [79] .",

Microbial dieoff was described by assuming first-order kinetics. First-order dieoff rate constants (k) were calculated from the literature for enteric mi crobial dieoff in soil-water systems. Correction factors were presented to adjust constants for changes in temperature, moisture, and pH of the soil. Average dieoff rate constants (log 1() /day _1 ) for selected microorganisms are shown in Table 9 .7. In the article by Reddy et al. [22] , data on dieoff of viruses during anaerobic digestion were used. Only data on virus dieoff in soil systems is shown in Table 9 .7. These values were obtained from various experiments and represent an average value of several soil and environ mental variables. Such an approach could prove useful for estimating mi crobial survival in soil-water systems, but a greater database is needed especially for viruses and other pathogenic bacteria. Also, most of our da tabase on microbial survival is in soil-water systems and not in groundwater.",

These studies demonstrate that soil type, rainfall, and other factors can affect viral movement into groundwater, and that viruses are capable of surviving long periods-which, when combined with the ability to move long distances laterally, could lead to wide dispersal through an aquifer. Vaughn and Landry [85] and Vaughn et al. [86] reported isolations of viruses from four groundwater recharge sites, from a stormwater recharge basin, and from groundwater under a sanitary landfill in New York. These sites have soils of coarse sand, fine gravel, and 1 to 2 percent silt. At the groundwater recharge sites, viruses were recovered at depths up to 11.4 m and at distances up to 45.7 m from the injection point of secondary or tertiary chlorinated effluent. As much as 22 to 33 percent of the 100-gal samples at the four sites were positive for viruses, with concentrations of 1.3 to 10.6 PFU per gallon. In addition, total coliforms were found in these samples. In order to reach the groundwater, viruses moved through 5.5 to 9 m of the overlying soil.",

The viruses moved at greater than 300 m per day and survived for at least 7 days. In laboratory studies, 6.2 days were necessary for a 90 percent reduc tion in liter; so in this case, the viruses could theoretically travel at least 2.5 km in groundwater before a 90 percent reduction could be effected under these conditions. Viruses in groundwater at other recharge sites have been studied with varying success. At the Flushing Meadows site near Phoenix, Arizona [90] , it was found that a fine loamy sand over coarse sand and gravel effectively removed viruses. Laboratory studies confirmed that this soil was an excellent adsorber. No viruses were detected in any of the samples of renovated water, even though levels of 158 to 475 PFU per liter were detected in the effluent applied.

Most of this chapter has dealt with the fate of viruses in soil because of their apparent greater potential for health problems associ ated with land treatment. Although the presence of viruses in groundwater has been demonstrated, it would appear that with proper site selection and management the presence of viruses could be minimized or eliminated. The key is to define the processes involved in the survival and transport of pathogens in groundwater. With proper design, land treatment could be used as an effective method for reducing the number of pathogens in wastewater. With the proper soil type, viruses and bacteria can be reduced to levels as effectively as by chlorination as currently practiced, after the travel of wastewater through only a few centimeters of soil. As we have shown, high removals by soil can be achieved from even raw wastewater. In the soil natural processes will eventually destroy the pathogens. Thus, in groundwater recharge operations, the soil should be considered as part of the treatment process and not simply as a final disposal source. The key to operating such systems for pathogen removal is to gain an understanding of the processes involved and methods by which they can be quantified and controlled. Based on both field and laboratory experiments, several potential treatment practices may be useful in enhancing virus removal during land application of sewage, and these are summarized in Table 9 .10.
