Therefore, the accurate diagnosis, serological monitoring, and surveillance of specific antibodies in pigs resulting from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection or vaccination would be essential in helping to control the spread of PED. We developed and validated an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the recombinant membrane (M) protein of PEDV. To detect PEDV antibodies in eight herds, 382 serum samples were collected from sows that had been immunized with a PED vaccine, and screened using the developed ELISA in parallel with a serum neutralization (SN) assay. Of the tested samples, 276 were positive for the presence of PEDV antibodies according to both assays, while 98 were negative. An excellent agreement between the ELISA and the SN assay was observed (kappa = 0.947; 95% confidence interval = 0.910-0.984; McNemar's test, P = 0.727). No cross-reaction was detected for the developed ELISA with other coronaviruses or other common pig pathogens. The developed ELISA could be used for serological evaluation and indirect diagnosis of PED infection.",

Porcine epidemic diarrhea is characterized by watery diarrhea, dehydration, and a high death rate among suckling pigs (Pensaert and DeBouck, 1978) . The disease was first documented in the United Kingdom in 1971 as a swine disease that resembled transmissible gastroenteritis (Oldham, 1972) . Outbreaks of PED have since been reported in Europe, Asia, and North America (Nagy et al., 1996; Takahashi et al., 1983; Sun et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2012; Stevenson et al., 2013) . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus has spread rapidly across the United States, resulting in the high mortality of piglets, and substantial economic losses (Cima, 2013) . Its recent emergence in North America suggests that this virus is a threat to the swine industry worldwide. Accurate diagnosis and serological detection of specific antibodies in pigs as a result of PEDV infection or vaccination are required to control the spread of PED.",

The genome of PEDV contains genes encoding spike (S), membrane (M), small membrane (sM), open reading frame 3, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Park et al., 2011) . The M protein is a structural membrane glycoprotein, and the most abundant of all the envelope proteins. It has a short amino-terminal domain that exists outside of the virion, with the long carboxyterminal domain of the protein present inside the virion (Utiger et al., 1995) . Immune reactions to the M protein of coronaviruses play an important role in the induction of protection, and in mediating the course of the disease (Fleming et al., 1989; Vennema et al., 1991) . The nucleotide sequence of the PEDV M gene exhibits low homology (around 50%) with the M gene of other coronaviruses; however, its sequence is highly conserved among different PEDV strains Arndt et al., 2010) . Therefore, the M protein could be a suitable candidate for the detection of PEDVspecific antibodies and in diagnosing PEDV infections.",

To effectively control and prevent this disease, detection methods that can assess the current epidemic situation in herds are required. In addition, for subsequent immunoprophylaxis, assays that can monitor serum antibody levels of immunized or infected pigs need to be developed. Before local immunity is actively established, the piglet intestine is protected against PEDV infection by maternal antibodies. Although the presence of antibodies in serum is not directly related to the protection for sows or for piglets, serological examination facilitates the assessment of humoral response to PEDV elicited either through vaccination or natural infection.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus was isolated for the first time in 1988 using the Vero cell line and trypsin-supplemented medium (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . Various diagnostic methods have been described for the detection of PEDV antigen and PEDV antibodies (Carvajal et al., 1995; Knuchel et al., 1992; Kweon et al., 1997; Song et al., 2006) . At present, serological diagnostic methods for the diagnosis of PEDV infection are more common. Given that ELISAs are simple, sensitive, and convenient serological detection methods, a number of commercial and in-house ELISAs have been developed to detect PEDV antigens, or antibodies against PEDV (Song and Park, 2012) . The majority of in-house assays for the detection of antibodies against PEDV are based on using the whole virus as an antigen (Carvajal et al., 1995; Oh et al., 2005) , or preparations of viral antigen (Knuchel et al., 1992) . The cultivation of PEDV is laborious and time consuming, especially considering the bio-security measures that must be taken in handling this virus; therefore it is difficult to upscale the production of these serological assays. The use of a recombinant viral protein as an antigen would allow researchers to avoid some of the problems associated with the large-scale preparation of native PEDV antigen. Recently, an ELISA based on a recombinant N protein was validated in China (Hou et al., 2007) . However, these researchers did not assess the cross-reactivity of the ELISA with other coronaviruses. The M protein of PEDV protrudes from the viral envelope, and is considered a superior diagnostic antigen compared with other PEDV proteins (Shenyang et al., 2007) . In the current study, we chose the PEDV M protein for use as an ELISA antigen because it is highly conserved among PEDV strains, and because it can elicit the formation of protective antibodies (Zhang et al., 2012) . We expressed the M protein in E. coli and confirmed its antigenicity using PEDV-specific antibodies. Our results indicated that the expressed recombinant M protein was indeed antigenic, and could feasibly be used as a coating antigen in an indirect ELISA.",
