            "text": "The aim of this study was to examine the occurrence of bacterial, mycoplasmal and viral pathogens in the lower respiratory tract of calves in all-in all-out calf-rearing units. According to clinical status, non-medicated calves with and without respiratory disease signs were selected of the 40 herds investigated to analyse the micro-organisms present in healthy and diseased calves. Tracheobronchial lavage (TBL) and paired serum samples were analysed for bacteria, mycoplasmas, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), bovine corona virus (BCV) and bovine adenovirus (BAV). Pasteurella multocida was the most common bacterial pathogen. It was isolated from 34% of the TBL samples in 28 herds and was associated with clinical respiratory disease ( p < 0.05) when other pathogenic bacteria or mycoplasma were present in the sample. Mannheimia spp. and Histophilus somni were rarely found. Mycoplasma bovis was not detected at all. Ureaplasma diversum was associated with clinical respiratory disease ( p < 0.05). TBL samples from healthy or suspect calves were more often negative in bacterial culture than samples from diseased calves ( p < 0.05). No viral infections were detected in six herds, while 16-21 herds had RSV, BCV, BAV or PIV3. In the herds that had calves seroconverted to BCV, respiratory shedding of BCV was more frequently observed than faecal shedding. This study showed that the microbial combinations behind BRD were diverse between herds. M. bovis, an emerging pathogen in many countries, was not detected. #",

The most important viral agents are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), bovine corona virus (BCV), bovine adenovirus (BAV) and bovine herpes virus 1, the causative agent of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR). Finland is free of IBR (Nuotio et al., 2006) and BVD is very rare (Rikula et al., 2005) . Thus far, Mycoplasma bovis has not been detected in Finnish cattle, and the last case of bovine tuberculosis (M. bovis) occurred in 1982. Moreover, prophylactic use of antibiotics is rare. Diseased animals are mostly treated individually, although a vaccine containing killed RSV, PIV3 and Mannheimia haemolytica was introduced after this study. This favourable disease situation provides excellent possibilities for investigating the epidemiology of certain respiratory pathogens in calves.",

A limited number of reports exist describing the etiology of BRD in all-in all-out calf-rearing units. There is also a shortage of knowledge of co-occurrence of bacteria, mycoplasmas and viruses in other than autopsied calves. Rearing of coeval calves in large groups in an all-in all-out system has increased during the last few years in Finland. Calves originating from several dairy farms are transported into a specialized calf-rearing unit at 1-3 weeks of age. There they are housed in group pens typically containing 20-50 calves. At the age of 3.5-5.5 months, the entire group is moved into a specialized beef-rearing unit. The allin all-out system enables efficient cleaning and disinfection procedures between rearing groups. On the other hand, mixing of calves from different farms exposes the animals to a heavy infection load, including microbes to which their dams do not have colostral antibodies. BRD is the most common and severe disease in calf-rearing herds.",

Both conventional bacteriological methods and PCR detection were used to detect bacterial pathogens, including mycoplasmas (M. bovis, M. bovirhinis, M. dispar) and Ureaplasma diversum, and PCR detection was used for viruses (RSV, PIV3, BAV, BCV) in the lower respiratory tract.

M. bovis was not found in this study, has never been isolated in the Finnish cattle population, and mastitis caused by M. bovis has not been reported in Finland. In a herd with endemic pneumonia every other 5-day-old dairy calf has been shown to shed mycoplasma (Stipkovits et al., 2001) , and infected cattle can shed mycoplasma via the respiratory tract for months or even years (Nicholas and Ayling, 2003) .

Although commonly isolated, it is not considered to be a primary causative agent of respiratory disease in calves (Maheswaran et al., 2002) . However, knowledge of the pathogenesis and level of genetic diversity of bovine P. multocida isolates is scant. Davies et al. (2004) found only limited genetic diversity among bovine P. multocida isolates originating mainly from clinical cases of pneumonia and mastitis. They suggested that the small number of P. multocida clones containing the majority of isolates have increased capacity to cause disease. We detected P. multocida in 26% of TBL samples from calves without clinical signs of respiratory disease. It would be interesting to analyse the genetic similarity of P. multocida isolates from TBL samples of healthy and pneumonic calves.",

For this reason, a two-fold rise in OD values was defined as seroconversion in cases where already the first sample was positive. For example, in a herd with one animal shedding RSV, all animals were seropositive for RSV in the first sampling.

Maternal antibodies are known to suppress the humoral response to RSV (Kimman et al., 1987; Uttenthal et al., 2000) . This phenomenon was seen in some of the herds. For instance, in a herd where four animals shed RSV, nine animals were seropositive and only one seronegative in the first sampling. In the second sampling, the only seronegative animal seroconverted, and OD values decreased for other animals, one animal becoming seronegative. However, in the majority of herds, seroconversion was observed in several calves. In conclusion, paired samples from several calves should be tested by serology to obtain reliable results of infection status of a single calf-rearing herd. The benefits of PCR include its speed and the ease of interpreting results. However, the virus secretion period is often short, which makes optimal sampling time crucial.",

(2000) found using antigen capture ELISA that 7.3% of feedlot cattle shed BCV via the respiratory tract. Much higher overall shedding rates in feedlots have been observed: 84% nasal and 96% faecal shedding using RT-PCR (Hasoksuz et al., 2002) , and 46% and 52%, respectively, using antigen capture ELISA (Cho et al., 2001a) . The shedding rates changed over time; shedding peak occurred on day 4 post-arrival and shedding ceased by day 21 (Cho et al., 2001b; Hasoksuz et al., 2002) . However, little is known about shedding rates in calves. In experimental infection, BCV could be detected by RT-PCR in nasal samples taken 3-4 days post-infection, and the shedding lasted for 2-10 days (Cho et al., 2001a,b) . The sampling time seems to be critical for the detection of virus, since nine herds were defined as infected according to serological findings, but no virus was detected by PCR. The shedding of BCV in faeces was found in four herds without respiratory shedding or seroconversion in the herd. Faecal shedding of BCV in calves with no clinical signs of diarrhoea should be investigated since subclinically infected animals are a possible source of exposure for uninfected animals.",

In six herds, BCV was detected in more than half of the faecal samples studied, and in four of these herds BCV was detected in the TBL samples of 4 out of 10 calves. Additional studies should be conducted to characterize similarities between the BCV strains detected in the faeces and respiratory tract of the same calf, and between BCV strains originating from different herds with dissimilar infection rates. Here, the BCV strains shed only in faeces in herds with no clinical signs and no serological findings should be characterized and similarity between those strains and strains associated with calf pneumonia, diarrhoea and winter dysentery should be examined.",

The study produced a large collection of respiratory pathogens. Further studies will be conducted on susceptibility to antimicrobials, on molecular epidemiology of pathogens and on the genetic similarity of P. multocida phenotypic variants or respiratory and intestinal BCV strains. Combining the results of the present study with clinical data collected from calves, including levels of acute phase proteins, is anticipated to improve diagnostics and treatment of respiratory disease in calves.",
