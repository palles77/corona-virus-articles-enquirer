Being relatively heavy, the effect of room air currents on these larger droplets is much less than that on droplet nuclei, and they tend to be removed from the air by gravitational deposition. They are nonetheless of considerable importance as a number of infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, are known to be transmitted by the droplet route. In order to protect HCWs in regions close to the patient, it is necessary to ensure that they are not exposed to these larger respiratory droplets. We would therefore encourage Kao and Yang to consider this issue in their future work.",

In our investigation, only coughs producing larger droplets (z30 mm) were considered for the requirements of isolation rooms used for non-airborne diseases, e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome. However, the results provided reasonable physical evidence that the appropriate airflow patterns with suitable operating parameters, e.g. 12 air changes/h, which dominates the average velocity inside the isolation rooms, can create a relative safe zone for staff. The value of 12 air changes per hour is determined by engineering experiments and specified in our national specifications (CDC of Taiwan) for the installation of hospital ventilation systems. In addition, our proposed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique is a simple and readily available method for analysing the air within isolation rooms that are subject to coughs producing larger droplets.",

Realistic simulations would require complex conditions and physical models, and would be restricted by limitations of numerical models for various situations inside the isolation rooms, e.g. the effect of evaporation for droplets, a long-time computational model for tracing each nucleus (micro-particles), and the problems of mathematical instability for the CFD techniques. The physical mechanism for droplet nuclei drying out during the transition of virus dispersal by airflow patterns inside the isolation rooms is not clear. For coughs producing smaller droplet nuclei, we suggest that alternative approaches are more suitable, i.e. tracer containment testing. 2, 3 As suggested by Profs Beggs and Kerr, in order to mark out the relative safe zone inside an isolation room, the fraction of relative hazardous zone (FHZ) is defined as:",

The computed values of FHZ for models investigated in our work were: (1) FHZ \u00bc 58.7% for VC-01; (2) FHZ \u00bc 46.0% for VC-02; (3) FHZ \u00bc 76.5% for VC-03; (4) FHZ \u00bc 61.5% for VC-04; (5) FHZ \u00bc 61.7% for VC-05; (6) FHZ \u00bc 46.2% for VC-06; and (7) FHZ \u00bc 36.8% for VC-07. 1 The safest zones were in the area near the air supply vents for each airflow pattern. 1 Model VC-07 (Figure 1 ) demonstrated the smallest relative hazardous zone of droplet fallout and virus diffusion of coughed gas.

The particular concern for the present-day neonatal population comes from their increased vulnerability to gastrointestinal insults. Concentration-dependent toxicity has been described following the use of hypochlorite on skin. 2 A questionnaire on disinfection of equipment associated with infant feeding revealed that 48 out of 71 (68%) UK neonatal units did not attempt to wash off the hypochlorite prior to use. 3 This is in accordance with some manufacturers' instructions. Nearly 90% of the units reported using hypochlorite disinfection at some stage; 61% for breast pump equipment and 77% for premature infant dummies, which are too expensive for disposal every time they are used. These articles were soaked in hypochlorite during the infant's stay, and discarded or sent to the hospital sterile services department on discharge. For bottles and teats, chemical disinfection was reported in 37% and 34% of units, respectively.",
