The Galliformes are considered to be rather primitive, unspecialized birds that probably evolved early in the evolutionary cycle. They all have relatively large stout legs and feet, with three forward-pointing digits and a smaller hind digit. Many of these birds are mostly terrestrial, and are incapable of prolonged sustained flight. In most species within the order the mode of flight is a short but rapid take-off, and then gliding or fluttering for short distances. The majority of these birds are nonmigratory. However, both grouse and guinea fowl can fly quite strongly, and the Old World quail and some species living in high altitudes do undergo a partial migration to better feeding grounds in winter.",

All Galliformes have an anisodactyl foot with three cranially directed digits and a fourth, the hallux, situated somewhat higher up the tarsometatarsus and directed caudomedially. In some families or subfamilies (e.g. jungle fowl, turkeys, pheasants) the cock birds have an extra osseous sharp-pointed spur situated above the hallux and directed medially, which is used for fighting and territorial dominance. In the common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), annual rings are formed at the base of the spur and can be used for ageing the bird. Care must be taken when handling such birds, since they can injure the handler. The green peacock will make a positive attack on humans and other animals using the spurs, and turkey cocks will fight to the death.",

Most Galliformes moult Table 13 .1a-c families, genera and representative species within the order Galliformes. The following are most likely to be encountered by the veterinarian, as they are often kept in captive collections a. Family: Phasianidae i. Subfamily Phasianinae (pheasants); 8 genera containing 21 species in most species the male bird has highly coloured plumage whilst the female is more dowdy. most cock pheasants have exceptionally long tails which are vaulted, i.e. in cross-section they are like an inverted v. The tail is used by the cock bird for display purposes when courting. The fourth digit (the hallux) is located more proximally on the metatarsus than the three forward-directed digits. in many species there is a pointed spur placed proximal to this fourth digit on the metatarsus. This appendage is used by the male birds for fighting to gain territory. Some species of pheasant have coloured facial skin on the head. most pheasants make a whirring wing noise during territorial display and are also quite vocal. The guinea fowl: there are four genera and seven species, all of which are found only on continental africa and the adjacent island of madagascar. all are medium-sized birds tending to be rather plump and heavy bodied with a fairly long neck, which together with the head is naked and the skin variously coloured. Some species have casques (e.g. helmeted and tufted guinea fowl) or occipital feather crests or wattles. Their plumage is mostly dark or grey. The tail of guinea fowl is small and drooping. although mainly terrestrial birds that tend to run rather than walk, the guinea fowl can fly quite strongly. annually after the breeding season, but ptarmigan moult three times yearly in line with the changes in colour of their sub-Arctic habitat (Jones 1998). They also moult the claws. The capercaillie and ptarmigan also fractionally moult the horn of the beak. When handled, grouse tend to shed some feathers as a normal defence reaction against attack. Most Galliformes have a bilobed preen gland with an associated wick of feathers, but its presence in grouse and turkeys is variable. Sand grouse have modified breast feathers during the breeding season for carrying water to the chicks left in desert nest sites.",

Fresh nutritious shoots are produced in the spring, whilst taller stands of heather are left for cover in which the grouse can nest. Mammals, especially sheep, carry ticks (Ixodes ricinus), and these arthropods carry louping ill virus, which affects both sheep and grouse. The population density of ticks varies regionally, and is affected by moisture, temperature and the underlying vegetation.

This change has occurred simultaneously with changes in farming practice, such as the removal of hedgerows and the marginal land surrounding arable crops, and the intensive use of selective herbicides to control weeds -which has at the same time reduced insect food suitable for partridge chicks. Furthermore, all types of insect life have been reduced by the use of pesticides on crops.

Red-legged partridge hens will lay two separate clutches of eggs, one of which she will incubate whilst her mate, the cock bird, simultaneously incubates the second clutch. Productivity is therefore doubled. In the wild, however, red-legged partridge are not so good at hiding their nests, so they are more susceptible to predation. Up until 1992, red-legged partridge were crossed with the related Chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar) and the hybrids were very successfully released; however, this practice has now been stopped because it was having a detrimental effect on wild-bred red-legged partridge.",

The newly hatched chicks can then be placed in heated brooders and gradually given access to outside runs.

Throughout this period the chicks will be fed on a variety of commercially developed diets, and some feeding often continues after release to retain birds on the estate.

All nesting sites, whether in trees or on the ground, should be provided with visual security. 4. In some species, greater breeding success is achieved if the eggs are incubated artificially. Such species include the New World quail, blue quail, Californian quail, bobwhite quail and also Japanese quail from the Old World. 5. Fostering using a broody bantam or Japanese silky hen to incubate and rear the chicks is a practice used by many aviculturists when a particular species is difficult to breed in captivity. If the foster hen is sitting quietly and tight, her eggs are exchanged for those to be hatched after 3 days. Species where this technique has been used include the common pheasant, partridges (Chukar, redlegged, Roul Roul and green wood), tragopans and Palawan peacock pheasants, and grouse. 6. After the chicks have hatched and dried, they should be placed in boxes approximately 50 \ue033 100 cm with a heat source so as to maintain a floor temperature of 40\u00b0C. A 150 W infrared lamp can be used. Damp cloths can be used on the sides of the box to maintain a relative humidity of 60%. Placing the chicks on towels (changed frequently) spread on the floor will help to prevent splayed legs. After 8-12 days, the chicks can be placed in a large rearing pen outside if the weather is suitable. This is best provided with a wire mesh floor to prevent slipping and splayed legs. ",

A sudden increase in the number of cases of visceral gout in a flock may be the result of a faulty water supply or dietary imbalance. All fresh vegetables must be adequately washed (they may be contaminated by wild bird faeces, very small minute molluscs, industrial aerial pollution, pesticides or herbicides used during cultivation). Chicks from hatching up to approximately 10 days of age Some of these chicks may be weak, not feeding properly and failing to thrive. This can be due to faulty incubation (humidity may be wrong), or they may just be genetically small. Small chicks easily get chilled (or can overheat) if in the brooder or with a bad hen. The artificial brooder ventilation may be faulty; there may be a build-up of fumes (ammonia, possibly carbon monoxide). All these predisposing causes may be presented as an E. coli or aspergillosis infection. Alternatively, poor incubator hygiene may be seen as umbilical or yolk sac infection. Chicks in this age group that fail to thrive may be affected by an acute form of runting syndrome (see disease No. 67 in Table 13 .3). Sudden death in very young quail chicks may be caused by an adenovirus (disease No. 8). Sudden death in young chicks of all species in outside aviaries could be due to spirochaetosis (disease No. 39).",
