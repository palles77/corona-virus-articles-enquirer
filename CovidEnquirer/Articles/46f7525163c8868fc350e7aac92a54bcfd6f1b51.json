Evidence suggests that established allergic airway inflammation may hinder clearance of the pathogen. Using a mouse model, Wu and colleagues 4 found that TLR2 expression was down-regulated in the presence of allergic inflammation and M pneumoniae infection. Recently, Wu and colleagues 5 also reported that lowdose M pneumoniae infection enhanced underlying allergic lung inflammation and augmented the T-helper 2 (Th2) response to allergen. By contrast, high-dose M pneumoniae infection attenuated the allergic response. Furthermore, Hoek and colleagues 6 demonstrated that rodent mast cells release IL-4 when cocultured with M pneumoniae, suggesting that M pneumoniae infection may promote allergic inflammation. Lastly, Chu and colleagues 7 found that M pneumoniae infection of allergen-sensitized mice resulted in an increase in airway collagen deposition.

Current techniques include culture, antigen detection, serology, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Culturing atypical bacteria is time-intensive and technically difficult. Other methods for detection include enzyme immunoassays (EIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and microimmunofluorescence. 3 For C pneumoniae, detection of IgM antibodies typically at 2 to 3 weeks after infection or a fourfold increase in IgG antibodies in convalescent sera suggests acute infection. For M pneumoniae, the EIA is frequently used to compare acute and convalescent sera looking for a fourfold increase in antibody titers. PCR detection of atypical bacteria is more sensitive, but there is a lack of standardization and availability. In addition, the correlation between these different diagnostic tests is fairly low. 12 A definitive diagnosis may require invasive tissue sampling, which is infrequently performed. Due to the lack of standardized tests and discordance between detection methodologies, there are limitations in the ability to accurately detect atypical bacterial infections of the lung, which subsequently affects the conclusions that can be drawn from available studies evaluating the role of atypical bacteria and asthma. Emerging techniques such as multiplex PCR and microfluidic platforms for M pneumoniae may provide methods for fast and sensitive diagnosis. 13 ",

Acute infection was diagnosed by either elevation of specific IgM at initial serology or a 4-fold increase in IgG titers at follow-up. The subjects were divided into 3 groups for data analysis. Group 1 included 119 subjects with acute exacerbation of asthma. Group 2 consisted of 51 subjects presenting with their first onset of wheezing. Group 3 comprised 152 controls with chronic, stable asthma without exacerbation in the previous 6 months and/or allergic rhinitis. In group 1, M pneumoniae was found in 24 subjects (20%) and C pneumoniae was detected in 4 (3.4%) subjects during exacerbation. In the new-onset wheeze group, M pneumoniae was detected in 26 subjects (50%), a statistically significant difference when compared with group 1, and C pneumoniae was identified in 4 (8.3%). In the control group, only 8 (5.2%) had evidence of M pneumoniae.

In their study, bronchoscopy with airway brushings was performed on 11 asthmatic subjects and 6 nonasthmatic controls with subsequent culture of airway epithelial cells at an air-liquid interface with and without M pneumoniae. MUC5AC mRNA and protein expression were measured using PCR and ELISA techniques. The investigators found a significant increase in MUC5AC mRNA and protein expression in the asthmatic cells that were exposed to M pneumoniae and that this increase was attenuated by coculture with an NF-kB or TLR2 inhibitor. 22 Kraft and colleagues subsequently postulated that the increased mucin expression in asthmatic epithelial cells in response to M pneumoniae likely involves TLR2 signaling and NF-kB activation. Similarly, Morinaga and colleagues 23 also found that C pneumoniae infection of airway epithelial cells led to an increase in MUC5AC expression that could be reduced by treatment with macrolides and ketolides. This study also concluded that both ERK (extracellular signal-related kinase) and NF-kB were involved in MUC5AC production triggered by C pneumoniae.

Culture, serology, and PCR techniques were used to evaluate for M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae. The primary outcomes were symptom scores and morning PEFs.
