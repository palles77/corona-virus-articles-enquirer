One of the main aims of systems biology is to couple these together to produce integrated models across multiple spatial scales and physical processes. In this review, we formulate a definition of multi-scale in terms of levels of biological organisation and describe the types of model that are found at each level. Key issues that arise in trying to formulate and solve multi-scale and multi-physics models are considered and examples of how these issues have been addressed are given for two of the more mature fields in computational biology: the molecular dynamics of ion channels and cardiac modelling. As even more complex models are developed over the coming few years, it will be necessary to develop new methods to model them (in particular in coupling across the interface between stochastic and deterministic processes) and new techniques will be required to compute their solutions efficiently on massively parallel computers. We outline how we envisage these developments occurring. r",

Advances in biotechnology, underpinned by a massive leap in computational resources, have provided a wealth of biological data at all levels of biological organisation. At the molecular and cellular levels the various genome and proteome projects (States et al., 2006; International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2005; Snow et al., 2005) , coupled with advances and innovations in microscopy and biological imaging, have provided descriptions of unprecedented detail of the constituent parts and basic structures of living organisms. The bulk of these data to date, particularly at the molecular level, has been obtained from in vitro, and usually static, laboratory experiments. Although increasingly dynamic changes are also being considered, experimental complexity usually restricts observations to single, or very restricted, spatial and/or temporal scales. However, the primary purpose of this massive experimental and data collection programme is to determine how biological and physiological function arises within living organisms, so that increasingly interest is turning towards 'integrative' or 'systems' approaches to the problem of function determination (Kitano, 2002) .",

For example, Noble (2002) explains how the success of drug therapy depends not only on the structure and direct function of the targeted protein but also on how it interacts with its surroundings: without this information we may not know which transporters, enzymes or receptors are active in the diseased state and, further, we will be unable to predict (potentially fatal) side effects of the therapy that are due to these interactions. In general, these dynamic interactions cannot be recreated purely by experimental observation, and the only feasible approach is to develop mathematical and computational models which couple together the underlying complex interacting non-linear processes.",

Hunter and Borg (2003) demonstrate that the spatial scales that may need to be considered in a complete model of the human body range from 1 nm (protein) to 1 m (whole body)-10 orders of magnitudeand the temporal scales from 1 ms (ion channel gating) to 10 9 s (human lifetime)-16 orders of magnitude. Such a wide range of scales requires a coupled hierarchy of models, each describing behaviour at a different scale, to encapsulate the complete system. In general, these resulting mathematical models are sufficiently complex that they can only be solved numerically, resulting in the increasing importance of computational simulation methods.",

We begin by giving what we hope is a helpful classification of multi-scale modelling in biology based on levels of biological organisation rather than absolute length or time scales. We then go on to discuss what we see as the key modelling, numerical, and computational issues that arise in such multi-scale approaches, before reviewing two of the areas in which these techniques have reached a high level of maturity: molecular dynamics (MD) and whole heart modelling. We conclude by discussing the progress made in these two fields towards addressing the difficulties inherent in the numerical solution of a multi-scale computational model and outline the type of problems we expect to see in the future as we try to model increasingly complex problems.",

Spatially, a natural way to do this is to split processes up according to their position within the biological hierarchy, i.e. whether they represent interactions between organs, within a tissue, between cells, and so on. We refer to these hierarchical positions as levels of biological organisation. On the whole they are relatively well-defined (e.g. we can intuitively say whether a given process involves discrete cells or a tissue or whether it occurs within an organ or across a larger organ system). However, it is not easy to give concrete values for the lengths at which we switch from one level to the next-for example, different types of cell can have very different sizes and some organs may be larger than small organ systems (especially if the comparison is done between different organisms).",

The most accurate representation of the interactions of electrons is obtained by solving the Schro\u00a8dinger equation (known as an ab initio calculation). However, the complex nature of the interactions means that it is currently not feasible to solve the time-dependant Schro\u00a8dinger equation (for any system containing more than one atom), and the timeindependent equation can only be solved for systems with fewer than 15 electrons (Miller and Clary, 2004; Th\u00f8gersen and Olsen, 2004) . For this reason, quantum mechanical (QM) simulations usually exploit some simplified model of the interactions between electrons (for a discussion, see Jensen, 2006) . Using commercially available QM packages, the structure of relatively large molecules can be investigated. For example, using Q-Chem the structure of a hexadecapeptide (80 heavy atoms) can be calculated in between 10 and 100 h (depending on the model chosen) on a single 2 MHz Opteron processor (Shao et al., 2006) .",

The system is governed by Newton's laws and the differences between the models are in the method used to calculate the forces, which are due to the deformation of chemical bonds, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic, dipole-dipole and van der Waals interactions. Many different force fields have been suggested: most represent a trade-off between accuracy (exact expressions are known for many of the forces) and numerical tractability (see, for example, Schlick (2002) for an overview of commonly used force fields). In contrast to the quantum level, simulations of relatively large dynamic systems are possible at the molecular level: the modelling of these systems is known as MD whereas structural determination using inter-atomic force fields is referred to as molecular mechanics (MM). Commercial MM packages can be used to estimate the structure of very large molecules. (Although the problems are computationally tractable, the accuracy of the predictions is dependent on the accuracy of the force field used.) In MD simulations, computational tractability is an issue even for relatively small systems: simulations of pure lipids can deal with length scales of the order of 10-30 nm and time scales of 'hundreds of nanoseconds' (Tieleman, 2006) . However, for the simulation of a more complex system-a patch of lipid bilayer containing a single ion channel and surrounded by water and ions (with tens of thousands of particles)- Tieleman (2006) records that the simulation of just 1 ns of activity requires between 1 and 2 days.",

As at the molecular level, Newton's laws govern the behaviour of the system and the modelling process amounts to the determination of an appropriate force field to describe the interaction between particles. Tieleman et al. (2001) describe how 'coarse-graining' can be used in the simulation of a large number of ions passing through a channel in order to calculate a macroscopic current. (The tens of nanoseconds that could be achieved with a MD simulation would not be sufficient to determine such a current.) We describe this level, where functional units consisting of several molecules are our base unit, as the macro-molecular level.

This in turn allows the flux of various substances to be modelled by processes such as diffusion or convection, which can be modelled using partial differential equations (PDEs) and spatially varying density functions rather than having to keep track of individual particles (or groups of particles). The natural upper bound to this single continuum level is the whole cell, where the cell membrane and the structural alignment between cells break up the continuum. Hence, we will refer to this as the subcellular level, in line with our convention of naming different length scales after their biological functionality. Note that in the physical sciences it is often referred to as the mesoscopic scale (since it lies between the microscopic and macroscopic scales). A wide variety of sub-cellular processes have been modelled. These are too numerous to give an exhaustive list, but include processes such as actin-myosin dynamics (Negroni and Lascano, 1996; Campbell et al., 2001) . However, the location of the sub-cellular level on the interface between stochastic and deterministic events makes it difficult to include in a multi-scale model since it can be difficult to couple models across this interface. (Nevertheless, the sub-cellular level can be considered the 'top' level in multi-scale models of ion channels, since the current through the channel is a sub-cellular process.)",

The typical size of a cell (10 -5 m, although there is a great deal of variety between different types of cell) also puts them at the interface between the mostly biochemical processes discussed above and the resulting macroscopic physiological properties. This property makes the cellular level a natural starting point for many integrative physiological models: cells are small enough to encapsulate many microscopic processes, yet large enough that they influence macroscopic behaviour. Cells are also selfcontained and isolated from their surroundings by a selectively permeable membrane (and in the case of prokaryotic cells also by a rigid cell wall). So, many of the interactions of a cell with other cells and the extracellular space can be summarised by recording the flux of various substances (ions, nutrients) across the cell membrane-suggesting that the formulation of conservation laws in the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe them provides a natural way of modelling their behaviour. Many cell models have been proposed over the years. Many of these (over 350, from a variety of fields at the time of writing) are accessible online via the CellML repository (http://www.cellml.org, and see Lloyd et al., 2004) . Noble and Rudy (2001) and Rudy and Silva (2006) have described the development of cardiac cell models, which are by far the most advanced cell models.

In addition to the cells, a region of tissue will typically also contain an extra-cellular matrix (ECM) that holds the cells together and gives them some structural stability. Since the cell models discussed in the previous section do not include the ECM, mechanical models are usually formulated at the tissue level. Properties that result from the interactions between cells (such as the propagation of a cardiac action potential or the development of a cancerous tumour) must also be modelled at this level. Since these processes depend on position within the tissue, the models usually consist of PDEs (or sometimes cellular automata) rather than the ODEs generally seen at the cellular level. Keener and Sneyd (1998) give an overview of a wide variety of tissue level models to describe many different physiological processes. A survey of mechanical models of various types of tissue can be found in Fung (1993) , while Humphrey (2003) provides a more recent review of the mechanics of soft tissue. An overview of cancer modelling is given in Preziosi (2003) . The amount of time required to run simulations of tissue level models can vary greatly. Generally, they can be solved relatively quickly if there is no interaction with models at the cell level-for example, the solution of a model containing a small number of coupled (and possibly nonlinear) PDEs on a finite element (FE) mesh containing many thousands of nodes (or on a finite difference (FD) grid with a similar number of degrees of freedom) may take minutes to hours on a single processor. If, however, cellular models are to be embedded in the tissue model then the time taken to simulate the model can increase dramatically-particularly if the cellular models show behaviour on multiple time scales necessitating small time steps.",

Usually the organ consists of a single main tissue type (e.g. myocardium in the heart) and several sporadic types (nervous, connective, blood). At the organ level, modelling usually consists of integrating tissue level models with one another and with a representation of the geometry of the organ that is being modelled. For example, a FE mesh might be constructed based on the shape of a real heart and encoding information about the fibre orientation at each mesh point (Vetter and McCulloch, 1998) . Various organ level heart models have been proposed and are discussed in more detail in Section 5 (see also the review by Kerckhoffs et al. (2006) ). However, it will be seen that these models are generally not of the whole heart but of single ventricles, atria or other subunits of the heart. Models of other organs are generally less mature than those of the heart, with most existing work concentrating on developing individual tissue level models rather than attempting to link them together. Recall that tissue level models can be computationally demanding. Since organ level models generally have tissue models embedded within them they require even longer to simulate. In fact, as will be seen in Section 5, accurate ventricular models often require several days to simulate even a few hundred milliseconds on very powerful computers.",

Examples include the nervous system, circulatory system, respiratory system and immune system. It follows that two or more of the organ models described in the previous section could be coupled to provide a model of an organ system. An initial candidate, building on current work on organ level models of the heart, could be the cardiovascular system. Modelling at the organ level is not yet mature enough for significant work to begin at the organ system level. However, Hunter et al. (2002) describe how ontological information such as publications, images, movies, models and anatomical notes have been collated from disparate databases to form a central resource. They also show how the bones, muscles and tendons around the knee can be built into an integrated model of the leg with mechanical stresses from the highest spatial level feeding back to the cell level where the balance of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in the bone is maintained. In a review by Crampin et al. (2004) there is a detailed description of how the cardiac and lung models are built from the cell level upwards. The geometric modelling of branching airways and alveoli bears substantial similarity with that of the pulmonary network of capillaries in the lungs. This is in turn similar to the blood supply in the heart. One can see that some of the problems tackled in modelling individual organs are duplicated in other organs. However, the task of combining organs into a single organ system is not as simple as running several models in tandem since there are feedback mechanisms (such as blood pressure and oxygenation) which cross between the systems. The development of sophisticated models of organ systems will require new models to be developed to describe these interfaces between the various organs that make up the system.",

According to the UK computer science community, the computational modelling of a simple biological organism such as the nematode worm is seen as a major computational challenge for part of this century (Harel, 2004 (Harel, , 2005 . With that in mind, modelling an organism such as a human must be viewed as ambitious-and consequently there is little existing work to discuss here. However, it would be a natural progression from the development of whole organ and organ system models to the construction of a 'virtual physiological human' (VPH): an integrated computer model to predict the response of a real organism to different physiological and pathological conditions. Hunter and Borg (2003) show that much of the work in constructing such a VPH relies on working from the bottom level upwards (from the gene via proteins and cells to the total organism). There are notable places in the modelling framework where information flows back down through the biological levels, such as signal pathways which couple events at the tissue level back to gene expression at a sub-cellular level.",

Each of these components of the environment may impact on the organism level model and, hence, may also need to be modelled. Further, the organism may play an active part in shaping its environment, leading to a two-way feedback mechanism. Most of the work in modelling biological systems within an environment has concentrated either on population growth between species which are competing for resources or on epidemiology-the spread of disease through a population of individuals. Interactions between individuals are modelled at a coarse scale using empirical data to provide the probability of certain events occurring. A typical compartmental epidemic model for the spread of a virus is the 'SIR' model, in which the interactions of three distinct populations of individuals (unexposed and therefore susceptible to the virus, infectious, or recovered from the virus) are modelled. A stochastic compartmental model was successfully used by Riley et al. (2003) to fit known clinical data from a recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The model is then used to predict the future spread of the disease under certain constraints such as travel restrictions. This type of analysis is common in epidemiology, and gives a good indication of the use of treatments and quarantine. However, its limitation is that the epidemic spread parameters are normally measured empirically. There is no coupling between the biological level of the virus and that of population mixing.",

While the 10 levels described above provide a natural range of length scales in many applications, there may be times when alternatives are appropriate. For example, genetic information does not fit comfortably into any of the levels: the complexity of the data DNA encodes for cannot be encapsulated by atomic or macro-molecular level simulations of its structure or dynamics. So, in an integrative model of tumourigenesis (the formation of a cancer, thought to be due to a genetic mutation) a more appropriate initial choice of levels might be: genetic, proteomic (gene expression), sub-cellular and cellular, although to model the growth and spread of a tumour accurately a number of tissue and organ level effects would also need to be included. Similarly, in some applications it may be more natural to merge two of the levels discussed here or to split one or more of them into distinct sub-levels. As with all areas of mathematical modelling, the way in which the model is formulated should take into account the nature of the system being modelled rather than simply following a rigid framework set out in advance.",

The simplified model can be used to give insights into the factors that influence the behaviour of the more complex real system (e.g. the identification of key parameters, or prediction of future behaviour). The accuracy of the model is, in general, dependent on the validity of the assumptions and the development of a good model is usually an iterative process, with successive generations of the model providing better approximations to the real system.",

In the context of biology and physiology, we have defined various length scales in terms of levels of biological organisation. Here we suggest a definition of multi-scale as being a model which includes components from two or more of these levels of organisation (multiple length scales) or if it includes some processes that occur much faster in time than others (multiple time scales). Examples of multi-scale physiological models are the bidomain and monodomain models of cardiac electrophysiology (see, for example, Keener and Sneyd,1998). These models describe tissue (or organ) level propagation of an electrical wave front. However, the wave front is caused by the existence of cell membranes containing conducting ion channels-a cellular level process. The chemical reactions that regulate the ion channels occur on multiple time scales. A further example of a multi-scale physiological model may be taken from respiratory physiology. The transport of gas into the lungs from the atmosphere is modelled at the level of the organ (Tawhai et al., 2000; Scherer et al., 1988; Whiteley et al., 2002) as is the transport of blood through the lungs (Burrowes et al., 2004) . These two processes are coupled by the transport of gas across the alveolar membrane, another organ level process. However, this diffusion is driven by reactions that take place within individual red blood cells and occur on a wide range of time scales and length scales (Whiteley, 2006b) .",

In turn, the mechanical contraction affects the electrical activity of the heart. Furthermore, both the mechanical deformation and the fluid flow in the chambers of the heart are clearly closely coupled. A general model of the heart should include the three physical processes of electrical generation and propagation, soft tissue deformation, and fluid flow. A second example of a multiphysics problem is avascular tumour growth. There is extensive literature devoted to modelling tumour growth (see Fasano et al. (2006) for a recent review). The growth of a tumour displaces surrounding tissue. This displacement is usually modelled by nonlinear elasticity. This deformation results in the surrounding tissue exerting a force on the tumour, which affects the growth of the tumour (Chen et al., 2001) .

However, to our knowledge, this has not been applied to any large-scale problem in the life sciences. For this reason we will mostly consider the computational modelling of stochastic processes and that of deterministic processes separately. In this section, we will outline some other difficulties in formulating and solving a multi-scale (or multi-physics) computational model for which more progress towards solutions has been made.

Usually this means that the lower-level processes can be assumed to occur instantaneously and can be included in a representation of the force field at the higher level. Storing the positions of each of the particles can cause problems in memory allocation and calculating the force resulting from each interaction can also lead to a very large number of calculations needing to be performed. In general, these factors mean that large stochastic models are usually computationally intensive.

As a rule of thumb it is usually much more efficient to use implicit numerical methods to solve stiff problems. There are several drawbacks with implementing implicit methods for the large non-linear systems that typically arise from physiological systems: we need to be able to write down the Jacobian matrix, which is usually non-trivial; sufficient memory is required to store the matrix; and it can be very expensive to compute its entries. However, explicit methods are vulnerable to numerical instability. So neither is ideal-the alternative is to use semiimplicit methods where the large problem is broken down into a system of smaller sub-problems and in each sub-problem some variables are solved implicitly and some explicitly. Choosing the decomposition in a suitable manner allows the benefits of both implicit and explicit methods.

In doing this we show how these fields have addressed the issues we described above.

They are also implicitly linked to one another, as it will be seen that the cellular level models used in heart modelling encapsulate the bulk behaviour of ion channels. The interface between the two fields is (approximately) at the level at which the interface between deterministic (heart) and stochastic (MD) is found. That each is considered separately emphasises the difficulty in modelling across this divide. The two fields also provide a contrast in the way multi-scale modelling has progressed. Many of the (relatively recent) heart models have been developed with an integrated organ model in mind.

The filter comprises a set of oxygen rings along the passage, of precisely the correct dimension for binding dehydrated K + ions. K + ions in solution have a hydration shell, and when they pass into the selectivity filter they dehydrate and bind to the carbonyl oxygen atoms in the filter. The binding directly balances the energetic cost of the dehydration.

This motion may cause conformational changes in the protein that affect conductance. Ligand sensitive channels have receptor sites that bind chemical messengers or transmitters. The binding of the messenger to the receptor alters the channel's state from either open or closed. Ligand sensitive channels are sometimes referred to as ionotropic receptors. They are usually specific to the ionic species they are permeable to, and binding of the transmitter usually opens the channel. In a few cases, the binding decreases channel conductance by causing a closing of the channel. The binding causes a conformational change in the protein which brings about the change in conductance. When the bound ligand dissociates, the channel reverts to its resting state. Channels can also be gated by stretching (mechanosensitive channels) and by a ligand sensitive mechanism where the receptor is not directly coupled to the channel (second messenger gating).",

Confining the ion channel structure to the pore region leads to a total simulation size of approximately 50,000 atoms. MD simulations have examined both the permeation pathway of channels (e.g. Berne`che and Roux, 2000; Shrivastava and Sansom, 2000) and the gating mechanism (e.g. Beckstein et al., 2003) . However, direct computation of ionic flux or gating motions is not yet feasible and there is a lack of fully resolved channel structures containing voltage sensors. We now look at an approach for gaining access to a longer time scale, concentrating on the permeation pathway. In the subsequent section, we will examine a method at the macro-molecular scale used to study the gating mechanism. Fig. 2 . Cutaway diagram of a typical MD potassium channel set-up.

The first makes use of the fact the ions pass through the channel on a time scale that is significantly shorter than major protein motions, and thus the protein may be described as a fixed collection of charges acting upon the ions. The other main approximation is to treat the solvent as implicit, thus avoiding the explicit calculation of the motion of several thousand water atoms. One could go a step further and use a continuum model for the ions themselves. However, the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) and Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) continuum theories have been shown to be unreliable as the size of the system under study approaches the Debye length Moy et al., 2000) .",

The time evolution of a particle undergoing Brownian motion can be described by the Langevin equation which contains both a dissipative force and a random force acting on the particle. Both these forces occur from the same origin-namely the random collisions between ions and water molecules in thermal agitation. However, when the ions are proximate to the ion channel they come under the influence of an electric force arising from four sources. The transmembrane potential creates an electric field which will influence nearby ions. Added to this field is the contribution from charged particles contained in the channel protein. All the ions in the electrolyte will also contribute to the field. The fourth charge is induced when the ion nears the protein wall and is a surface charge of the same polarity at the interface between the protein and water. The contribution from all these sources must be accounted for when performing Brownian dynamics simulations (Chung and Kuyucak, 2002) . Chung et al. (1999) applied Brownian dynamics to the potassium channel in their permeation study. They used an idealised representation of the channel, based on the structure obtained by Doyle et al. (1998) .

Izvekov and Voth (2005) note that CG potentials can be expected to have less transferability than atomistic ones, because they are potentials of mean force, and may be sensitive to changes in temperature and other thermodynamic variables. It is therefore desirable to be able to re-derive CG potentials under the same thermodynamic conditions as they will be used, and thus efficiency of the derivation process becomes important.

This enabled potential profiles to be computed for single potassium ions passing through the channel. MD simulations of potassium ions in the pore were performed to obtain velocity autocorrelation functions, from which the fluid dynamic diffusion coefficient was derived. This coefficient was in good agreement with the bulk diffusion coefficient of potassium ions in water. Having obtained the ionic mobility, Brownian dynamics simulations were then performed in one dimension to determine the ionic fluxes. Onedimensional Brownian dynamics is an effective constraint on the ion to only move in the axial direction of the channel. From the ionic flux measurements, current-voltage curves and average channel conductance were both shown to agree reasonably well with experiment. The mean number of ions in the channel at various transmembrane potentials was compared with the computed Using flux-ratio exponent and they were found to be in good agreement.",

Several coupled physical processes occur at each level and there are complex feedback mechanisms between the scales in both directions. Further, almost all of the processes occur on multiple time scales. These properties make the development of an accurate whole heart simulator very difficult, both in terms of the formulation of appropriate models and the development of appropriate numerical algorithms and powerful computers to make the solution of the resulting systems of equations tractable. Since the early 1990s (Henriquez et al., 1990; Panfilov and Holden, 1993; Panfilov and Keener, 1993) various groups have developed software to simulate cardiac behaviour. Progress has been rapid and by 2003 integrative models of the ventricles, the atria or the sino-atrial node were being used as paradigms for the development of a 'physiome' model of the whole human body (Hunter and Borg, 2003) . In this review we focus mostly on ventricular models and the term 'organ level model' will often be used to describe a representation of a whole ventricle (i.e. a level of organisation above the tissue level) rather than of the whole heart.",

(For instance, the heart receives feedback from the circulatory and cardiovascular systems.) Multiple time scales are also present in the heart-this can most easily be seen by noting that the time it takes for the heart to contract during a beat is much less than the time between beats. In addition to this multi-scale behaviour, the integrated heart also exhibits multi-physics, with interactions occurring between models of electrophysiology, tissue mechanics, metabolism and circulation (coronary and systemic). Here we outline some of the methods used to develop the models used in the simulators discussed later. In general, electrophysiology is considered at both the cellular and tissue level and mechanics at the tissue level. These models are then embedded in an organ level representation of the geometry of the heart (or ventricle, atria or sino-atrial node).

The gating variables represent the probability of any given ion channel (or part of a channelmany channels are controlled by more than one gating variable) being 'open'. When a channel is open, a transmembrane potential drives a capacitive current through it. The total transmembrane current is calculated by multiplying this nominal current by the proportion of channels that are open. Early models of cardiac cells included only two (FitzHugh, 1961; Nagumo et al., 1962) or three (Noble, 1960) variables. A second generation of cardiac cell models included ion concentrations (Beeler and Reuter, 1977) , which were involved in regulating the values of the gating variables, and incorporated more ion channels as they were discovered experimentally (sometimes in response to predictions of the models, e.g. McAllister et al., 1975) .",

They include terms to describe the currents due to ion pumps and exchangers (DiFrancesco and Noble, 1985; Luo and Rudy, 1991) . Intra-cellular mechanisms, in particular the regulation of the Ca 2+ concentration by the sarcolemma, can also be included (Luo and Rudy, 1994a, b; Faber and Rudy, 2000; Winslow et al., 2000) . The Kyoto model of Matsuoka et al. (2003) and the model of Sachse et al. (2003) include sarcomere dynamics and cardiomyocytes-allowing the cell to contract in response to changes in intra-cellular ionic concentrations. Stretch-activated ion channels have also been included in ionic models (Kohl et al., 1999; Healy and McCulloch, 2005) , allowing for two-way feedback between the electrophysiological and mechanical models of the heart. Although there are a large number of (nonlinear) ODEs in the models, their individual solutions can be computed extremely quickly. However, problems may arise when a large number of cellular components are embedded in a tissue or organ level model-the cumulative expense of solving many thousands of complex cell models may be high. For this reason, many simulators still use the early models with few ionic currents. Further, Fenton and Karma (1998) have attempted to work back from the more complex models to determine the model with minimal ionic complexity that accurately reproduces the cardiac action potential. The resulting model contains three channel currents (the same number as in some of the earliest cell models). The discussion of cell models in this section should not be considered to be at all exhaustive. There are many more models available than those mentioned here. In particular, only ventricular cell models have been discussed. A much wider selection of models (including a description of the physiology that they describe) can be found at the online CellML repository (www.cellml.org, and see Lloyd et al., 2004) .",

The difference between these two potentials drives a current across the cell membrane, which is modelled at each point as a capacitor connected in parallel with the ionic currents defined in the cellular level model.

            "text": "Many different models have been suggested to describe the mechanics of cardiac tissue, with almost every simulator using a different one. However, there are many similarities between the various models. All use some type of nonlinear, finite elasticity model to describe the passive properties of the tissue. These can be broadly classified according to whether they use exponential (Lin and Yin, 1998; Usyk et al., 2002) or pole-zero law models for the strain energy function. If the simulator uses a geometrical model of the heart (see below) which includes myofibre orientation, then the tissue is usually assumed to be either transversely isotropic (with the direction in which it behaves differently aligned with the fibres) or orthotropic. Where the mechanics is included in a multi-physics model, the coupling is generally achieved by including an 'active tension' term which causes the tissue to contract in response to the electrical activation (Negroni and Lascano, 1996; Hunter et al., 1998; Lin and Yin, 1998; Campbell et al., 2001; Usyk et al., 2002) . Generally, the contraction first occurs when the Ca 2+ concentration reaches some critical value, acts in the direction of the myofibres (if included in the geometry) and then tails off over time. In some cases (Negroni and Lascano, 1996; Campbell et al., 2001 ) the active tension is calculated by explicitly modelling the average behaviour of a large number of sarcomeres (which exist at the sub-cellular or cellular level). A natural extension would be to remove the averaging and include active tension at the cellular level. This process has been begun by Matsuoka et al. (2003) .",

The mechanical properties of the cardiac tissue were modelled using the orthotropic model of Usyk et al. (2000) , which is responsible for the coupling between the two physical processes. Again, there is no direct feedback from the mechanical model to the electrophysiological model, but the electrophysiological model is solved on a mesh deformed according to the mechanical model.

The simulation of 1.2 s of cardiac activity requires 72 h of computational time on a single processor of a Silicon Graphics Origin 2000 (Usyk and McCulloch, 2003) . This is very much faster than the comparable simulation performed by the Auckland group described above. (Recall that this took 3 weeks using 8 processors.) It is not clear exactly why there is such a difference in the simulation times, but one possible reason is that the mesh used in the UCSD work appears to be coarser (48 elements for the mechanical component) than that used in Auckland (128 elements for the mechanical component-both simulators use a finer mesh for the electrophysiology). Since the stability of the explicit Euler method depends on grid spacing this also suggests that a smaller time step is required for the Auckland simulation than the UCSD one, further increasing the computational demands. The trade-off for the additional time required to simulate the system is that the Auckland results may be more accurate due to their finer mesh and smaller time step. The UCSD cardiac simulation package, Continuity 6, is distributed free for academic use by the National Biomedical Computation Resource (NCBR).",

No cellular level model is required as the membrane potential is fully determined at the tissue level. The mechanical model used (also at the tissue level) is due to Kerckhoffs et al. (2003) and is coupled to the electrical propagation model by the presence of an active tension that depends on the passive tension and the time since depolarisation (i.e. active tension is larger immediately after the wave front passes through a region). In simulations that use this method, only the propagation wave front is seen-not the entire action potential. Further, the two physical processes are only weakly coupled: the propagation of the electrical wave is determined first by the solution of the eikonal-diffusion equation and then this is used as an input for the mechanical model-hence there is no feedback mechanism between the two physical processes, reducing the accuracy of the model. However, the trade-off for these simplifications is that the computational time is significantly reduced: one complete cardiac cycle can be computed in approximately 5 h on a Silicon Graphics 64-bit Origin 2000 at 225 MHz (Kerckhoffs et al., 2005) .

Since the interactions between the physical processes are not a factor in these simulators, much more sophisticated models of the single physical process can often be used than in their multi-physics equivalents. Holden (2002, 2004) have developed the Sheffield Cardiac Arrhythmia Model (SCAM)-a package to simulate the generation of an electrocardiogram (ECG). As well as modelling the electrophysiology of cardiac tissue, SCAM also considers the propagation of the action potential through the whole torso and its detection by electrodes on the chest and back. The heart model is similar to that used by the Auckland group, with the Fenton-Karma equations being coupled to the monodomain model and the explicit Euler method being used to advance in time. Further, the Auckland canine heart model (Nielsen et al., 1991) is used to generate a FD grid at the organ level. Electrical propagation in the torso is also included (with the torso modelled as an isotropic Ohmic resistor) in order to simulate ECG generation. SCAM is noteworthy for its representation of behaviour at the organ system level (the inclusion of a whole torso model). Similar work has since been carried out by Pullan et al. (2003) , who have embedded an electromechanical model of the heart within the torso in order to elucidate the contributions of contraction to the ECG. Typical results from a simulation using SCAM are shown in Fig. 3 .",

The resulting simulator is very fast: 1 s of electrical activity takes approximately 1.5 h to simulate on a single 667 MHz Alpha processor and using a grid with 2.7 million degrees of freedom-although this speed is at least in part due to the very simple cellular level model that is used.

On a mesh with roughly twice the number of degrees of freedom (5.64 million) as that of Fenton et al. (2005) , 6 h of computational time are required to simulate each second of cardiac activity on an NEC SX4/16 supercomputer. Some of this additional time will be due to the additional overhead required for a FE implementation and the additional degrees of freedom, but a large proportion of it is because of the increased complexity of the cellular model (which, recall, is embedded at each node).",

Top panel right, APD restitution for the three cell types obtained in a thin strip of simulated tissue using an S1 S2 protocol, with a basic (S1) cycle length of 500 ms. The cell model used is the four-variable reduced model described in Cherry and Fenton (2004) with parameter sets fitted to experimental recordings from canine endocardial, mid-myocardial and epicardial cells as described in Cherry et al. (2003) . The parameter sets were obtained by personal communication from E.M. Cherry and F.H. Fenton. Lower panel shows colour-coded repolarisation times in long and short axis slices through the Auckland canine ventricle geometry (Nielsen et al., 1991) , obtained using an explicit FD solution of the monodomain model with a space step of 0.25 mm, a time step of 0.05 ms, and anisotropic diffusion with coefficients of 0.002 cm 2 ms -1 and 0.0005 cm 2 ms -1 along fibres and transverse to fibres, respectively. The four images show repolarisation patterns during steady pacing at 500 ms intervals from an epicardial distribution of sites of earliest activation based on experimental data (Scher and Spach, 1979) . The top two images show repolarisation with uniform epicardial cells, and the lower two images show repolarisation patterns obtained during steady pacing with layers of endocardial, mid-myocardial and epicardial cells, each of equal thickness. The right-hand panel shows a simulated electrocardiogram assuming the heart is immersed in an infinite volume conductor. The traces shown were computed for the uniform epicardial model (blue) and for the heterogeneous model (red), showing that the different pattern of repolarisation associated with heterogeneity produces an upright instead of a biphasic T wave. Courtesy of Dr. Richard Clayton. activation time rather than the complete action potential is calculated, and Gurev et al.

This is because the numerical solution of the bidomain equations is 'computationally intensive' compared with that of the monodomain equations (Vigmond et al., 2002) . The additional time required to solve the bidomain equations mean that they have not yet been implemented in a multi-physics whole heart (or whole ventricle) simulator. However, single-physics electrophysiological simulations using the bidomain equations and realistic heart geometries have been performed.",

They suggest that they can be solved efficiently by decoupling the extra-and intra-cellular potentials and advancing in time using Euler's method for each in turn. The method is implemented in parallel using MPI. FE methods are preferred to finite differences or finite volumes since they can better deal with the irregular geometry, curved boundaries and inhomogeneous conductivity of the heart. Observe that these simulations of the bidomain equations use more complex cellular models than many of the monodomain simulators discussed above. The use of these more advanced cell models is possible because the reduced computational demands of a single physics simulator in comparison with a multi-physics one outweighs the increase in complexity that results from switching from a monodomain to a bidomain model.",

In order to model realistic disease, such as the onset of a heart attack, one would need to be able to calculate heart function over a period of at least 15 min (about 5000 times longer). Since most computational heart models are based on cardiac cells and heart geometry from relatively small mammals (rabbit, dog or pig) there is a further level of complication when it comes to modelling a human heart attack-the cell models contain about four times more parameters than the average rabbit cell model, the geometry is larger and the heart beat is slower.",

Detailed models have been developed from the cellular to organ levels, coupled together and simulated on powerful computers to reproduce the dynamics of a beating (healthy) heart over short time periods or to study defibrillation. However, much work still remains to be done in order to develop a multi-physics simulator that is sufficiently accurate-and sufficiently fast-for use in real-world applications involving coupling the electrophysiology and mechanics to models of the circulatory system and metabolism (perhaps in silico testing of drugs or personalised medicine). Such a simulator would likely need to use the bidomain equations as part of a multi-physics model. No such simulator exists at the moment. In order to model an abnormal heart or drug action (rather than a normally beating heart) it will also be necessary to develop models to describe unhealthy cardiac cells and tissue.

In a recent publication (Whiteley, 2006a) , it is shown that the speed of the solution of the cell models can be vastly improved (the solution is computed roughly 15 times faster) by using implicit numerical methods for ARTICLE IN PRESS Fig. 4 . A rabbit ventricular geometry model (Vetter and McCulloch, 1998) with smooth epicardial and endocardial surfaces and anatomically realistic fibre orientation was discretised using an unstructured grid with an average discretisation of 250 mm. The bidomain equations were discretised on this non-uniform grid using linear tetrahedral elements with a time step of 8 ms. The active membrane behaviour was described by the rabbit ventricular Puglisi model (Puglisi and Bers, 2001) incorporating an electroporation current (De Bruin and Krassowka, 1998 ) and a hypothetical I a current (Cheng et al., 1999) . Details of the applied numerical methods are found in Plank et al. (2007) . Two plate electrodes, a stimulation electrode and a grounding electrode, were used to stimulate the ventricles by delivering a train of ten pulses (see top panel). Subsequently, electric activity was simulated for another 2 s. Simulations were carried out with C m \u00bc 1 mF cm -2 and b \u00bc 1400 cm -1 . Initially, conductivity along the fibres was set to s il \u00bc 1.74 mS cm -1 and s el \u00bc 6.25 mS cm -1 , and transverse to the fibres to s it \u00bc 0.19 mS cm -1 and s et \u00bc 2.36 mS cm -1 , in the intracellular and interstitial domain, respectively (Clerc, 1976) . The conductivity of the surrounding fluid was set to s b \u00bc 1.0 mS cm -1 . To determine suitable parameters which lead to a re-entry under the given protocol, the basic cycle length (BCL) of the pulses and the wave length of the tissue, l, were varied. From the series of simulations, a standard was chosen with a BCL of 200 ms and l reduced to 0.66 of the nominal l, as computed with the default conductivity settings, leading to a sustained figure-of-eight re-entry circulating around the apex (see bottom panels).

Furthermore, the use of partial evaluation and look-up tables (Cooper et al., 2006) may be used to increase efficiency by a further factor of five. Combining these speedups gives an overall speedup of 40. Further unpublished results by Whiteley suggest that, if one uses a judicious choice of a coarse spatial mesh combined with fine spatial meshes in places where cell activation is under way, it may be possible to speed computation up by a factor of 2500 (compared with computation on a fine mesh alone) with minimal loss of accuracy. The combination of all of Whiteley's and Cooper's techniques should provide a speed-up of several orders of magnitude. However, to our knowledge, only a few of these techniques have been implemented in the solution of real cardiac problems at the time of writing. We might speculate that a single processor could be able to solve 15 min of bidomain simulation time in less than a day of real time.",

During a coronary occlusion (heart attack), portions of the heart tissue are starved of oxygen and become infarcted. Over the course of time, the functionality of neighbouring tissue adapts to the new environment, this phenomenon being known as re-modelling. Experimentalists have produced data from which models of healthy, infarcted and re-modelled tissue may be derived, but the longitudinal study of how tissue morphs from its healthy state is yet to be investigated. In order to model the variation of a single cell, we may need to augment the known cell models for healthy cells by providing many more parameters.",

In the time following a heart attack, the victim becomes susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia. To counteract this susceptibility, clinicians may prescribe a drug treatment and/or allow the heart to be shocked by a pacemaker. The upshot is that to model properly the onset and treatment of cardiac infarction requires the solution of a bidomain simulation of the entire heart for weeks of simulation time, involving a more complicated (and as yet unknown) cell model together with the ion-channel effects of particular drug treatments. Such a simulation would be many orders of magnitude harder to solve than any recent studies and would still not provide the realism of electromechanical coupling or the flow of blood in the heart cavities and blood supply.",

At the present time, many potential prescription drugs fail to come to market because they are discovered to cause the side-effect of elongating the QT phase of the ECG in some patients. This side-effect (which is normally unrelated to the original clinical use of the drug) is dangerous because it may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and fibrillation in a significant population of people taking the medication. Clinical testing on humans occurs towards the end of the drug-development cycle after vast resources have already been spent. If computer models of cardiac function could be used earlier in the cycle in order to screen for long-QT syndrome, then the drug discovery process could be streamlined. In order to do this we would need to be able to run cardiac models for several weeks of simulation time, in healthy and diseased heart models, and to model the interaction of drugs at the cell-membrane level.",

MD simulations have, until recently, usually been restricted to a single scale. At each length scale, advanced and very general simulation packages have been developed over a period of more than 20 years and are based on well established force-field models and solution algorithms. These packages can deal with a wide range of different types of problem (e.g. they are not specific to ion channels). The switch to a less detailed level of functionality (quantum to molecular to coarse-grained) occurs either when the simulations begin to require unrealistically large amounts of time to run or when the amount of memory required to calculate the solution exceeds that available. In heart modelling, on the other hand, much more work has been done on considering how to couple together models from different levels of biological organisation and from different physical processes. The models themselves are at a much more dynamic stage of development, with new models being proposed continuously. The software used to compute solutions of the model equations is also more ad hoc in nature than in MD, with almost every active research group writing their own packages to simulate their models.",

Heart modellers have begun to develop efficient algorithms to couple together several very different models with two-way feedback, and then efficiently compute a numerical solution of the combined system. They are now beginning to see some of the computational issues that have already been addressed in MD (simulation times measured in weeks rather than hours and the need for more memory than is ever available). Similarly, the increasing use of multi-scale models in fields such as ion channel modelling is leading to researchers in MD being faced with problems similar to those already being considered in heart modelling. In both fields the use of parallel computing technology is extensively used to reduce the amount of time that is necessary in order to complete the simulation.",

This type of work is beginning to be carried out in projects such as the Physiome Project of the International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) (Kohl et al., 2000; Hunter et al., 2002; Hunter and Borg, 2003 ) that aims to construct a ''quantitative description of the physiological dynamics and functional behaviour of the intact organism'' (Bassingthwaighte, 1995) . The requirements of projects such as these will give rise to new problems that have not been considered until now. Increased accuracy (both in the model and the numerical techniques used to solve it) is needed in order to simulate very long time scales to prevent the model solution from gradually drifting away from the true behaviour of the system as the simulation progresses. The causes of this drift can be difficult to identify as the problem will not manifest itself in short test runs of the simulator. Solutions related to the biology of the system, such as thermodynamically valid cell models, might be developed in order to reduce this drift. In order to model across the divide between stochastic and deterministic processes, it is possible that entirely new modelling techniques will have to be developed. However, the development of these techniques will likely be necessary in order to fully explain how molecular level interactions (between drugs and proteins) lead to whole organ phenomena such as the long-QT syndrome and, ultimately, the death of whole organisms. Finally, the computational requirements of simulating the very complex models that will result from these types of problem will require the use of very powerful, massively parallel supercomputers and the development of improved numerical algorithms to efficiently implement the parallelisation.",
