There are gaps in knowledge about prevention of influenza by medical masks and respirators. There are several prospective, randomized controlled trials on the use of handwashing, [6] [7] [8] but only two trials on the use of medical masks \u2044 respirators in households. 9, 10 In one of these studies, we showed that medical masks \u2044 respirators in compliant users in the household setting were associated with reductions in the risk of influenza-like illness (ILI)associated infection. 10 To date, there is one small randomized controlled trial (RCT) of medical masks compared to respirators in HCWs 11 which found no difference, but lacked a control arm. Medical masks are not designed to provide respiratory protection. 12 They have consistently lower filtration efficiency when compared to respirators, which are designed specifically for respiratory protection. [13] [14] [15] Medical masks were designed to prevent wound contamination when worn by the surgeon; however, three RCTs failed to show efficacy against their intended design. [16] [17] [18] The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of medical masks compared to fit-tested and non-fit-tested N95 respirators in HCWs in the prevention of disease because of influenza and other respiratory viruses.",

We initially aimed to determine the efficacy of two different kinds of respiratory protection (N95 respirators and medical masks) during the influenza season compared to each other and compared to a no-mask group. However, although we intended to have a randomized control group, this was not acceptable to the Chinese IRB, who felt it would be unethical to assign HCWs randomly to not wear a mask, given mask use was widespread in Chinese hospitals that were included in the randomization. As such, we studied a convenience-selected no-mask group of HCWs who did not wear a mask. These HCWs were selected from other hospitals where mask wearing was not routine during the study period. Absence of randomization in the no-mask group meant that we eventually had to restrict the primary analysis of the trial to the comparison of the efficacy of N95 respirators and medical masks with each other.",

A pre-study assessment of hospital infection control levels determined that the hospitals had sufficient diversity to warrant stratified randomization by size of hospital and level of infection control. This assessment measured ventilation, spatial dimensions, bedding configuration, handwashing facilities and personal protective equipment use. The Ministry of Health in 1989 categorizes hospitals in China into three levels (Level 3 is the highest) depending on their level of sophistication, equipment and staff \u2044 bed numbers.

Pharyngeal swabs were tested with at the Laboratories of the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Viral DNA \u2044 RNA was extracted from 300 ll of each respiratory specimen using the Viral Gene-spin TM kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc., Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed on 8 ll of RNA in a final reaction volume of 20 ll for 1AE5 hours at 37\u00b0C, using the RevertAid TM First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) to synthesize cDNA. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using the Seeplex \u00d2 RV12 Detection kit (Seegen, Inc., Seoul, Korea) to detect adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus 229E \u2044 NL63, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 or 3, influenza viruses A or B, respiratory syncytial virus A or B, rhinovirus A \u2044 B and coronavirus OC43 \u2044 HKU1. Three microlitres of synthesized first-strand cDNA, 4 ll of multiplex primers, 10 ll master mix (hot start Taq DNA polymerase and dNTP are included in the reaction buffer) and 3 ll of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) were added (8-MOP, accompanied by UV irradiation for 20 minutes, prevents amplification of contaminated DNA). A mixture of 12 viral clones was used as a positive control template, and sterile deionized water was used as a negative control. After preheating at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes, 40 amplification cycles were carried out under the following conditions in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR system 9700, Foster City, CA, USA): 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 1AE5 minutes and 72\u00b0C for 1AE5 minutes. Amplification was completed at the final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The multiplex PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on an ethidium bromidestained 2% agarose gel. Viral isolation by MDCK cell culture was undertaken for some of the influenza samples which were positive by nuclei acid detection.

Differences in proportions between the trial arms were tested by calculation of Pearson's chi-square using SAS 9.2 software (Cary, NC, USA). The distribution of key potentially confounding variables between study arms was compared. To estimate the odds ratio while adjusting for the clustering effects, we used a random effect logistic regression model. In the model, we added a hospital-specific random intercept in the linear predictors, and maximum likelihood was estimated using adaptive quadrature. 20 The model was fitted using 'xtlogit' command in STATA (College Station, TX, USA). 21 We also conducted multivariable analysis to adjust for the potential confounders. In the initial model, we included all the variables along with the main exposure variable those were significant (P < 0AE05) in the univariate analysis. We then used a backward elimination method to remove the variables that did not have any confounding effect, that is, could not make meaningful (roughly 10%) change in the effect measure with the main exposure variable. 22 In case of high multi-collinearity because of strong correlation among the potential confounders, we chose the more relevant ones having the highest confounding effect on the association of interest.",

However, the convenience no-mask group was not a randomized control arm and hospitals in this group were actually selected on the basis that most of their staff did not wear masks (which is not the norm in hospitals in Beijing), suggesting that conditions in those hospitals were different than those in hospitals from the masks groups. As a consequence, it is not possible to make any definitive judgement on the efficacy of masks on this basis. One possible bias would be if those hospitals had differentially higher risk of infection compared to the intervention hospitals, for example because of the occurrence of outbreaks. However, we monitored all hospitals involved in the study for outbreaks which may have increased apparent attack rates, and none were documented. Other than that, possible sources of bias that could have plausibly increased the infection rate in the control arm (namely vaccination, handwashing, hospital level and high-risk procedures) were measured. In a post hoc adjusted analysis, only hospital level and the N95 arm were significant against CRI and laboratory-confirmed viral infection. Respiratory protection is a key strategy for pandemic control and key to sustaining the health care workforce. The fact that rates of all outcomes were consistently lower in the N95 group suggest that N95 respirators might offer better protection for HCWs; but a larger trial is needed to make a definitive judgment about the relative efficacy of respirators and medical masks. A recent, smaller trial found no difference between N95 and medical masks, but was ",

This is different from the intervention in our study, which comprised wearing the mask for the entire shift. In addition, that study measured serological evidence of influenza as an outcome, which comprised the majority of outcomes, but did not exclude influenza-vaccinated participants, a flaw that would have resulted in falsepositive cases of 'influenza'. The finding that fit testing did not improve the efficacy of N95 respirators is important, although it could be explained by a lack of power. The value of fit testing varies with the quality of the respirator, and our study used a high-quality respirator. These results would not be generalizable to other respirators, where fit testing may be more important. As such, we still recommend that fit testing be part of the process of using respirators.",

Scoping work with Australian HCWs showed compliance of 10% with continual mask wearing during a severe influenza season. 24 Beijing was selected to maximize the power of the study because of the strong culture of mask wearing among HCWs. Another limitation of the study is that cluster RCTs can be impacted by heterogeneity of behaviours, meaning that we cannot exclude such effects caused by behaviours we did not measure. The cluster design is also strength, as interventions against infectious diseases can have herd effects. In infectious diseases which can spread from person to person, the 'herd effect' is a real and documented phenomenon where protecting some individuals with an intervention (most commonly vaccination, but also applicable to other interventions) can also protect individuals who were not protected by the intervention. Therefore, if some individuals are randomized to masks on a ward, the individuals who do not wear masks may also be protected because of the effect the masks have on interrupting the transmission of disease from person to person. This is why it is preferable to use cluster design, where everyone in the cluster gets the same intervention. In our study, masks or respirators were worn during the entire shift. Some policies recommend mask \u2044 respirator use only when HCWs are conducting high-risk procedures or entering an isolation room. Whether masks \u2044 respirators will be protective when used only when an identified episode of exposure occurs depends on whether HCWs accurately identify all episodes of risk, whether most transmission occurs after clearly identified exposures and whether there is transmission from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections. There is currently no evidence on how much of a HCWs' risk is unidentified or unrecognized. In our study, HCWs who conducted high-risk procedures had higher rates of CRI, but not of laboratory-confirmed pathogens or influenza. Further clinical research is required to determine the efficacy of continuous versus targeted mask use.",

We showed that in Australia, less than half of parents who were randomized to wear a medical mask or respirator while their child was ill adhered with mask wearing. 10 There may be adverse effects of wearing masks, which can reduce adherence. [28] [29] [30] Our study showed significantly higher reported adverse effects of N95 respirators compared to medical masks, consistent with other studies. 28 Interestingly, this population of Chinese HCWs reported overall similar rates of discomfort with masks as parents in our household study, 10 with higher rates in the N95 group, but it did not affect their adherence with mask \u2044 respirator wearing. This suggests that discomfort is not the primary driver of adherence, and rather, cultural acceptability and other behavioural factors may be the main reason for non-adherence. The past experience of Beijing health workers with SARS may also be a factor in the high adherence. This level of adherence may not translate to Western cultural contexts in a normal winter season, especially for N95 respirators; however, adherence can change with perception of risk. During a pandemic, we would expect HCWs to have higher adherence to infection control measures. In summary, our study adds evidence on the use of respiratory protection for HCWs, but highlights the need for larger trials and comparison of different policy options.",
