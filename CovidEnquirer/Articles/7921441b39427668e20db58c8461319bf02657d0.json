As a longitudinal case study, the island destination of Bali provides insight into tourism crisis vulnerability, particularly in relation to issues of unplanned development and host community overdependence on tourism revenue. Furthermore, the experience of two separate targeted terrorist attacks on the island reveals a number of challenges and tangible lessons for stakeholders engaged in destination disaster management and crisis recovery. While the restoration of consumer confidence and arrival numbers are often considered to be indicators of successful tourism recovery, the broader disaster management literature advocates for proactive vulnerability reduction premised in sustainable development and comprehensive, integrated disaster risk reduction.",

As it became evident that the main attacks were specifically targeted at international tourists and associated commerce (Australian Federal Police AFP 2005) the mass exodus of travellers from the region was almost immediate. Lacking any degree of formal disaster management planning or preparation, the coping mechanism and strategies adopted by the majority of destination stakeholders were completely ad hoc and reactive (Bali Recovery Group, 2003; Ellis, 2002; Pacific Asia Travel Association PATA 2003) . The significant tourism crisis evidenced over subsequent months and even years, exposed the relative vulnerability of the local tourism industry and a community that had developed an overreliance on the tourist economy (BaliSOS, 2004; Consultative Group of Indonesia CGI 2003; Gurtner, 2007) .",

Such research is an essential foundation for assisting the tourism industry and relevant government agencies to learn from past experiences, and develop strategies for avoiding and coping with similar events in the future (2001:136) With the increasing incidence and prevalence of disaster events at popular tourism destinations there has been a parallel growth in relevant literature from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. Discourse in development studies, disaster risk reduction, and strategic tourism disaster management remain prominent in this sphere of research. As each theoretical paradigm provides a different context to vulnerability and hazard reduction, the synthesis of these ideas provides a broader scope to understand the issues and challenges associated with effective crisis prevention, impact mitigation, and destination recovery.",

With the assistance of government sponsored development planning and initiatives, tourism progressively grew around the \"sun, surf and sand\" ethos, primarily concentrated on the southern peninsula of the island (Sobocinska, 2011; Vickers, 1989 ). The 1980's saw an expansion towards small scale cultural tourism, while the 1990's heralded a period of rapid unrivalled growth, consistent with mass tourism (averaging 12e15% per annum) (BPS 2015; Sobocinska, 2011) . Despite short-term consumer and market uncertainty associated with international and regional events such as the Gulf War, political instability, the Asian Financial Crisis, and even the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in America, Bali continued to increase its popularity as an international tourist destination (BPS 2015) .",

Lacking significant options for economic diversification the majority of the host community were forced to adapt and adopt drastic coping measures, often aided by donor initiatives and funding (Bali Recovery Group, 2003) . The government focused its efforts on increasing security measures, bringing the Bali Bombing perpetrators to trail, and preventing further terrorist activities (AFP 2005; October 21) . With the advice and support of international consultants and organisations such as Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA 2003) , the tourism sector actively engaged in heavy promotion, marketing and discounting measures.

Safety and security measures with related education and training had improved, however Bali still lacked a formal disaster management plan (ADRC 2013). In October 2005 this capacity was tested through a second smaller series of terrorist attacks at a number of popular tourist locations on the island (AFP 2005) . In contrast to the original attacks in 2002, government and tourism officials demonstrated a relatively efficient and coordinated response to this new crisis event, with tourism numbers only gradually declining by about 30% over the subsequent month (The Guardian, 2005 ; December 3). However, with a precedence for terrorist attacks now established, consumer confidence in the destination had become increasing volatile.",

Natural causes are considered the second highest cause of tourist deaths (DFAT 2014). Other common incidents include drug possession and/or trafficking and criminal behaviour, methanol/alcohol poisoning, drunken behaviour, drownings, STDs/ AIDs or rabies infection. While local acts of violence, robbery, extortion and other crime do occur, these rates are not inconsistent with similar tourist destinations in Southeast Asia (BHA 2015).

Ritchie (2008) contends that understanding such challenges and impediments is integral to the development of strategic and comprehensive planning for improved disaster management. As afflicted destinations struggle to recover from depressed economic conditions, the urgency of political and economic priorities exert pressure on government and industry decision makers to expedite a \"return to normal\" rather than support longer term social capital strategies such as better education, training, and livelihood diversification.

Although there is evidence of existing partnerships between tourism industry and government, industry and emergency service providers, and/or government and private enterprise, there are few examples of effective host community participation and integration within the formal destination disaster management process (IDEP Foundation, 2015) . Beyond existing rhetoric of greater collaboration and cooperation, the issue of achieving and maintaining such stakeholder integration remains a priority. Additionally, further longitudinal studies of tourism crisis are recommended to assess the real sustainability and viability of destination recovery management strategies beyond a direct restoration of destination image or visitor arrivals numbers.",
