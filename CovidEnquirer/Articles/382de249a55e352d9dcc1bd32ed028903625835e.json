This study aimed to quantify LPS-binding protein (LBP), CD14 and haptoglobin in the lungs throughout a PRCV infection. LBP and CD14 recognize LPS and enhance its endotoxic activity, whereas haptoglobin dampens it. Gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated intratracheally with PRCV (n \u00bc 34) or saline (n \u00bc 5) and euthanized 1e15 days post inoculation (DPI). Virus was detected in the lungs from 1 to 9 DPI. Cell-associated CD14 in lung tissue increased up to 15 times throughout the infection, due to an increase in highly CD14 \u00fe monocyte-macrophages from 1 to 12 DPI and CD14 \u00fe type 2 pneumocytes from 7 to 9 DPI. LBP and soluble CD14 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were elevated from 1e12 DPI, with up to 35-and 4-fold increases, respectively. Haptoglobin levels increased significantly (\u00c24.5) at 7 DPI. In addition, we found that PRCV could sensitize the lungs to LPS throughout the infection, but the response to LPS appeared less enhanced at the end of infection (7 DPI). The marked increases in LBP, CD14 and haptoglobin were not correlated with the extent of the LPS response.",

LPS-binding protein (LBP) and CD14 are major components of this complex and mediate the early recognition of LPS. LBP is produced by hepatocytes and is constitutively present in plasma [6] . Because plasma LBP levels rise several times during systemic acute-phase responses, LBP is considered an acute-phase protein. Recently, type 2 pneumocytes were also shown to produce LBP after in vitro stimulation with different proinflammatory cytokines [7] . LBP acts as a lipid transfer molecule, extracting single LPS molecules from bacterial membranes or LPS aggregates and transferring them to CD14. CD14 is a pattern-recognition receptor, which is expressed by monocytes and macrophages and to a lesser extent by neutrophils [8] . CD14 also exists in a soluble form, which is enzymatically cleaved from the membrane or directly secreted from the cytoplasm [9] . Like LBP, soluble CD14 is constitutively produced by hepatocytes, and plasma concentrations can rise significantly during acutephase responses. Importantly, soluble CD14 facilitates LPSdependent activation of CD14-negative cells, such as epithelial and endothelial cells [10] . CD14 presents LPS to Toll-like receptor 4, which leads to the activation of different proinflammatory genes. Depending on the amount of inflammatory mediators that are induced, the endotoxic effect of LPS varies from mild inflammation to live-threatening functional disorders.",

This assay is based on the competition between membrane-bound CD14 on macrophages and soluble CD14 in the test sample for binding to anti-CD14 antibodies (mAb MIL2). Briefly, BAL fluids and serum samples were mixed with anti-CD14 antibodies, resulting in an antibody concentration of 1 mg/ml. PBS was used as a negative control. The sample-antibody mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 C. Porcine alveolar macrophages (5 \u00c2 10 6 ) were then incubated with the sample-antibody mixtures for 1 h at 4 C. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled goat-anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies (4 mg/ ml, 10% goat serum) (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 4 C. The cells were washed three times with cold PBS after each incubation. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the macrophages was determined using flow cytometric analysis (Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur, BD Cellquest software). Ten thousand cells were analyzed for each sample. Samples that contain soluble CD14 reduce the availability of anti-CD14 antibodies for binding to CD14 on the macrophages, resulting in a decrease in the MFI. The amount of soluble CD14 in the test sample was expressed as a ratio compared to the negative control sample. This ratio was calculated by dividing the MFI of the negative control sample with the MFI of the test sample.",

Several authors suggest that the inflammatory activity of LPS in the lungs depends on the local balance between factors that enhance its endotoxicity (such as LBP and CD14) [5, 24] and factors that suppress it (such as haptoglobin) [11] . Our main aim was to determine the kinetics of these proteins in the lungs throughout a PRCV infection. We found significant increases in LBP and CD14 in the lungs throughout the entire infection (1e12 DPI), whereas haptoglobin levels only rose significantly at the end of infection (7 DPI).",

Up to 20% of the epithelial cells in these bronchioli were infected, as revealed by immunofluorescence staining for PRCV antigens (data not shown). At later stages, infected bronchioli became rare, whereas infected pneumocytes were found throughout the entire infection. This is in line with the observation that we seldom observed peribronchiolar clusters of highly CD14-positive monocytes at stages later than 2 DPI. Instead, there was a progressive increase in highly CD14-positive monocyte-macrophages in the alveolar tissue. It is likely that these highly CD14-positive cells were derived from blood monocytes, which migrated towards the infected cells. Monocyte infiltration starts early after the onset of infection, as indicated by the fulminant increase in monocytes in the BAL fluids at 1 DPI. Surprisingly, highly CD14-positive pneumocytes appeared in the lung tissue at 7 and 9 DPI (see Fig. 2 ). At this late stage of infection, there was pronounced hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes and a minority of these cells expressed high levels of CD14. This was unexpected, as CD14 is considered a specific marker for myeloid cells [16] . Few researchers reported CD14 expression by other cell types. Fearns et al. [25] describe that lung epithelial cells of mice can be induced to express CD14 upon stimulation with IL-1 or TNF-a. In our study, the corresponding BAL fluids did not, however, contain TNF-a or IL-1 (data not shown), but did contain high amounts of soluble CD14. The positive signal on these pneumocytes might have been due to binding of soluble CD14 on the cell membrane and not to endogenous expression. The biological significance of these CD14-positive pneumocytes remains unclear.",

Bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells are continuously exposed to LPS-contaminated dust, but do not express CD14 on their membranes. The presence of soluble CD14 in the bronchoalveolar fluid could thus be crucial for their interaction with LPS. It is unclear whether the increases in LBP, soluble CD14 and haptoglobin in the BAL fluids are due to plasma leakage or local secretion. Interestingly, the 2-fold increase in soluble CD14 on day 3 coincides with a relative decrease in cell-associated CD14 in the lung tissue. So, the increase in soluble CD14 might be due to local shedding of membrane-bound CD14. Monocytes, more than macrophages, are an important source of soluble CD14, which is cleaved from their membranes in response to cytokines such as interferon-g [26] . Indeed, the amount of soluble CD14 (Fig. 1 ) correlated positively (r \u00bc 0.68, P < 0.01) with the amount of monocytes in the BAL fluids (Table 1) . LBP and soluble CD14 levels in sera did not rise, but haptoglobin levels rose dramatically as early as one day after virus inoculation. Importantly, we found no correlation between BAL fluid and blood levels for any of these proteins, emphasizing the compartmentalization of the inflammatory response in the lungs during respiratory virus infections. This agrees with previous studies in which we detected high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, in the BAL fluids of virus-infected lungs, whereas blood levels remained low or undetectable (unpublished data).",

The combination of PRCV and LPS induced severe respiratory disease in 4 out of 6 pigs, whereas the pigs inoculated with PRCV or LPS alone showed no or only mild disease signs. Severe signs coincided with a synergistic increase in TNF-a and IL-6 levels in the lungs. This agrees with a previous study, in which we found that the PRCV-LPS induced respiratory disease was highly correlated with increased levels of TNF-a in the lungs [4] . TNF-a and IL-6 are important disease mediators and increased production in the lungs might contribute significantly to the exacerbation of clinical disease. IL-6 is often considered a secondary pro-inflammatory cytokine, and it is therefore unclear whether it is induced directly by LPS or indirectly by TNF-a. In future studies, we will dissect the role of different pro-inflammatory cytokines in PRCV-LPS induced respiratory disease by use of neutralizing antibodies. The enhancement of the LPS response was strong at 1 and 3 DPI, but tended to be milder at the end of infection (7 DPI). Several authors describe a correlation between the amount of LBP and CD14 in the lungs and the sensitivity to LPS [27, 28] . In a previous study, we found that infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), another respiratory virus of swine, also increases LBP and CD14 in the lungs, which coincides with enhanced LPS sensitivity [13, 15] . Importantly, we found no correlations between LBP, CD14 or haptoglobin levels and the extent of the LPS response in the present study. Indeed, LBP and CD14 levels were highly variable at the first day of infection, whereas most pigs showed a similar increase in the LPS response at the same time point of infection in the study of Van Reeth et al. [4] . Despite exceedingly high levels of LBP and CD14 at 7 DPI, the LPS response tended to be milder than in the beginning of infection. Possibly, the activity of LBP and CD14 is counteracted by the induction of anti-inflammatory mechanisms or LPS scavenger molecules at the end of infection. Indeed, we found a significant increase in the anti-inflammatory haptoglobin in the BAL fluids at 7DPI. However, the pigs that responded poorly to LPS at this time point of infection did not have higher haptoglobin levels than the high responder pigs. The pronounced differences in LPS sensitivity at the end of infection remain unexplained.Despite the fact that PRCV and PRRSV are both classified in the order Nidovirales and show structural resemblances, the pathogenesis of both virus infections differs strikingly as outlined by Van Reeth et al. [29] . Still, both virus infections increase the amount of LPS recognition proteins in the lungs and dramatically enhance the response to LPS. It is tempting to speculate that both processes represent non-specific responses of the lungs to viral infection and possibly also occur during infection with other respiratory viruses. Interestingly, SARS CoV-infected lungs are typically loaded with ''activated'' macrophages, and SARS is associated with excessive production of cytokines [30] . LPS recognition proteins have not been quantified in SARS CoV-infected lungs, but an exaggerated response to LPS or other bacterial compounds might also contribute to the development of SARS.",
