The samples collected were: lungs, tonsils, lymph nodes (mediastinal, mesenteric, inguinal and submandibular), pancreas, spleen, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, ileum and stomach. A total of six primary antibodies anti-CD3, anti-CD79a, Mac 387, anti-lysozyme, anti-CD45RA (3C3/9) and anti-SLA-II-DQ (BL2H5) were used with a standard avidin\u00b1biotin peroxidase (ABC) method. Anti-CD3 and anti-CD79a mAb-reacted, respectively with cells located in T cell areas and B cell areas. Mac 387 recognised circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes, while anti-lysozymestained resident macrophages in all tissues. 3C3/9 and BL2H5, were assessed in formalin-\u00aexed paraf\u00aen-embedded tissues for the \u00aerst time. 3C3/9 identi\u00aeed B lymphocytes, in primary follicles and mantle zones, a subpopulation of T cells, especially located in the marginal zone of the spleen and a variable number of immunoblasts, in the germinal centres. BL2H5 reacted with B cells in the mantle zones of the follicles of lymphoid tissues, with dendritic and interdigitating cells in all studied lymphoid tissues and with a variable number of resting and activated T cells in the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALs), marginal zone and red pulp of the spleen. Furthermore, it stained Kupffer and perivascular macrophages in the liver This study represents a detailed histological study of the distribution of the most important subpopulations of immune system cells in conventional, healthy pigs. In our view, these tools should be useful for future comparative studies in disease conditions. #",

            "text": "Immunohistochemistry is a useful technique for characterisation of immune system cells in tissues in pathogenic studies of diseases in humans and animals. Many antibodies have been developed that recognise cell populations in lymphoid organs, but the majority of them work only on frozen sections (Bianchi et al., 1992; Haverson et al., 1994; Denham et al., 1998) . In such sections, the evaluation of morphological details is more dif\u00aecult than in paraf\u00aen-embedded sections (Falk et al., 1994) . For this reason, detailed studies of the distribution of the different cell populations in the swine immune system are hampered by the lack of antibodies that allow the detection of these cells in formalin-\u00aexed, paraf\u00aen-embedded tissues. The cross-reactivity of some antibodies to human differentiation markers has allowed immunostaining of a few swine immune cell populations with protocols standardised in formalin-\u00aexed, paraf\u00aen-embedded tissues. Cross-reacting polyclonal anti-human CD3 antibody is considered an excellent marker for swine T lymphocytes when used on paraf\u00aen sections (Mason et al., 1989) . The identi\u00aecation of B lymphocytes is a more complex issue. Antibodies against several molecules, such as immunoglobulins (Ramos et al., 1992) , CDw75, CD79a, CD79b and HLA-DR have been tested (Tanimoto and Ohtsuki, 1996) . Among all these molecules, CD79a is one of the two polypeptide chains forming the CD79 molecule that is to say without the a, which has been considered the B cell equivalent of CD3 (Mason et al., 1995) . In swine, mAb anti-CD79a has been described as a useful pan-B marker, in paraf\u00aenembedded tissue, although it also stains cells of non-lymphoid origin (Tanimoto and Ohtsuki, 1996) . More recently, a mAb to the largest isoform of porcine CD45 (clon 3C3/9, Bullido et al., 1997a) has been used for phenotypic and functional analyses of porcine lymphocyte subpopulations. The 3C3/9 antibody recognises all B lymphocytes and a subpopulation of T lymphocytes, and it has been applied only in frozen sections (Bullido et al., 1997a) .",

The swine also has become an increasingly interesting experimental model to investigate transplant rejection, and a potential donor for xenografts (Sundt and Sachs, 1992; Bennet et al., 2000) . Detailed knowledge of the normal distribution of cell populations of the immune system is required to understand pathogenesis of changes in these processes. The present work investigated this normal distribution by immunohistochemical techniques in paraf\u00aen-embedded tissues of conventional pigs, using four available antibodies and two mAbs which reactivity in paraf\u00aen-embedded tissues had not been characterised previously. Polyclonal anti-human CD3 has been considered a speci\u00aec pan T cells antibody in paraf\u00aen-embedded tissue (Mason et al., 1989) . In our study, distribution of positive cells in normal lymphoid and non-lymphoid porcine tissues agreed with a previous description of other authors (Tanimoto and Ohtsuki, 1996) , con\u00aerming the speci\u00aecity of this antibody for T cells in swine tissues. T cell areas in lymphoid organs are clearly depicted with this antibody. In our study, in addition to T cell zones (Tanimoto and Ohtsuki, 1996) , scattered cells with lymphoid morphology appeared stained in the marginal zone of the spleen.",
