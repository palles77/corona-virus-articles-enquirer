            "text": "Betaherpesvirinae; it is prevalent in nearly 90% of the adult population worldwide. 1 HCMV infection is associated with viral persistence in a latent form similar to other herpesviruses and reactivation of HCMV is a serious issue for patients with impaired immune systems. For example, there is a high probability of serious coinfections such as pneumonia and gastrointestinal diseases, among others, in recipients of donor organs and bone marrow transplants or HIV-infected patients. 2 Because of the high prevalence of the virus throughout the human population, HCMV is the most common cause of congenital viral infections in newborns. 3 HCMV is able to penetrate the placenta and subsequently infect the fetus, leading to stillbirths 4 and innate deformities. 5 The current treatment for HCMV infections is focused on five FDA-approved drugs: ganciclovir, 6 its oral prodrug form valg anciclovir, 7 foscarnet, 8 cidofovir and its prodrug brincidofovir. 9 Unfortunately, these drugs also cause some serious side effects, which significantly limit their clinical utility. 10 Aside from low bioavailability these drugs also exhibit significant toxicity. In particular, foscarnet and cidofovir lead to nephrotoxicity, 11 while ganciclovir inhibits the functions of bone marrow, thereby leading to thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia. 12 Further, it has been found that long-term treatment of HCMV infections leads to the generation of resistant HCMV variants. 13 As a result, there is an urgent need to find safer compounds that exhibit potent anti-HCMV activity, which is not accompanied by such serious side effects.",
