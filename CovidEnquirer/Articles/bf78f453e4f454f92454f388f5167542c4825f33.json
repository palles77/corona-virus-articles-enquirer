            "text": "To investigate the role of individual viral proteins in virus replication and in induction of immunity, we have prepared cDNA clones beginning from the polyadenylated 3' end of the TGEV genome and examined the sequences of potential genes (Kapke and Brian, 1986) . Within the first (3') 2000 bases, we deduced, from an examination of open reading frames, a noncoding region of 276 bases, and genes for a 9101 mol wt hypothetical hydrophobic polypeptide, a 43,426 mol wt nucleocapsid protein, and part of a matrix protein, arranged in that order from the 3' end of the genome. Assuming that a conserved intergenic sequence would be found in TGEV as has been found in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) (Budzilowicz eta/., 1985) , and the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) (Brown and Boursnell, 1984) , we prepared a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide that is complementary to the TGEV intergenic sequence and used it as a primer for first-strand DNA synthesis in the preparation of additional genomic cDNA clones. Several cDNA clones were thus prepared and seven that mapped within the first (3') 2601 bases were sequenced in part and another clone was sequenced completely to derive a potential gene sequence for the M protein. The nucleotide sequence predicted an M protein that shared many features with the M proteins of the mouse hepatitis virus, the bovine coronavirus, and the avian infec-367 0047-6R77IRR S7 CMl tious bronchitis virus, but also predicted an unexpected, potentially cleavable amino-terminal signal peptide that makes the TGEV M protein strikingly different. In this study, we have confirmed our preliminary report of the M gene sequence (Kapke et a/., 1987) and have examined the behavior of the amino-terminal peptide during synthesis of the M protein.",

The insert was removed from this plasmid using Pstl, digested with Bsp1286 to remove the 5' 114 bases, and blunt-ended with mung bean nuclease. The fragment now contained 13 bases upstream (5'-ward) from the CTAAAC presumed intergenie sequence (or 22 bases upstream from the presumed M gene start codon) and extended to the end of the 13-base C-tail which begins 9 bases downstream from the M gene stop codon (bases 922-924 in Fig. 2 ). The blunt-ended fragment was ligated into the Smal site of the pGEM3 vector (Promega Biotec) and the orientation yielding a sense-strand RNA by transcription with SP6 polymerase was chosen. The construct was designated pGEM-M-l. Transcripts were prepared from EcoRI-cut plasmid using the SP6 transcription system marketed by Promega Biotec. To reconstruct the truncated version of the M gene (i.e., the M gene with no N-terminal signal peptide), clone pGEM-M-l was cut with Sphl, which cuts within the multiple cloning region of the pGEM vector and between bases 174 and 175 in Fig. 2 , and the resulting large fragment was isolated, religated, and designated pGEM-M-2.",

            "text": "The molecular weight of the glycosylated M protein has been estimated from electrophoretic migration patterns to be approximately 28 to 30 kDa (Brian et a/., 1983; Garwes and Pocock, 1975; Wesley and Woods, 1986) . We therefore anticipated that we would be able to deduce from the gene sequence a molecular weight of 28 kDa or less for the unglycosylated protein. and Brian, 1986) yielded a protein of 289 amino acids (Armstrong et al., 1984; Tooze et al., 1984) and bovine having a molecular weight of greater than 32,000 (Fig. coronavirus (Lapps ef al., 1987) We hypothesized that this is unlikely, however, based on the documented evidence for leader-primed transcription in coronavirus replication (Makino et a/., 1986b), and on the existence of a primer binding-like intergenic sequence early in the open reading frame. The most probable site for initiation of transcription of the M message is suggested by the sequence CTAAAC beginning at base 128 in Fig. 2 , which is part of a conserved intergenic sequence in the TGEV genome. It is a sequence found in total and again in part between the M and N genes beginning at base 926 in Fig. 2 , and also between the N and hypothetical hydrophobic protein genes (Kapke and Brian, 1986). It is also part of the intergenic sequence found in the MHV genome (Budzilowicz et al., 1985) . If CTAAAC functions as part of an intergenic sequence that directs leader-primed synthesis and thereby defines the start of the M transcript for TGEV, then the M protein coding sequence could start with the first available methionine 3'-ward of the CTAAAC sequence, a codon that begins at base 137 in Fig. 2 . It could also start with the second, downstream, in-frame AUG codon beginning at base 200, but this is surrounded by a much less favorable Kozak consensus sequence (Kozak, 1983) . To test our hypothesis, we prepared transcripts identical to the postulated functional mRNA structure (transcripts from the reconstructed full-length M gene, construct pGEM-M-1, that would initiate translation at the first AUG downstream from the CTAAAC sequence) and compared sizes of the resulting translation products with those of mRNA isolated from infected cells. Figure 3A, lanes 2 and 5, M protein translated in vitro from cell-derived, poly(A)selected mRNA and immunoprecipitated with TGEVspecific antibody had an electrophoretically determined molecular weight of 25K and comigrated with protein translated from the reconstructed full-length M gene. Protein translated from the reconstructed fulllength M gene immunoprecipitated with the same antibody thus confirming its authenticity (Fig. 3A, lane 8) . Furthermore, truncated M protein (generated from construct pGEM-M-2), although also antigenically authentic, migrated distinctly faster than full-length M but with a migration rate much less than expected for a 2-kDa molecular weight difference (Fig. 3A, lanes 9  and 12) . The small difference in electrophoretic mobility between the two forms of M again is an ostensible function of the hydrophobic nature of the protein. The electrophoretically determined molecular weight of the truncated M polypeptide is 24.5K. Judging from the size of the various translation products, it is unlikely that initiation of translation in vivo starts at any place other than at the first AUG downstream from the CTAAAC intergenic sequence.",

Regions of high sequence homology are found among the proteins. Most notable is a stretch of 8 amino acids beginning at position 132 on the TGEV sequence that is identical for all four viruses. By computer analysis using a protein alignment function, 34, 32, and 19% of the TGEV protein sequence is homologous with that of BCV, MHV, and IBV, respectively. Furthermore, a hydrophobicity plot of the TGEV M protein shows three internal hydrophobic domains that align with similar domains in BCV, MHV, and IBV ( Fig. 4 and data not shown; Rottier et al., 1984; 1986) , BCV (Lapps et al., 1987) and IBV (Boursnell et al,, 1984) .

Assuming a parallel structure for the M proteins of the four viruses and assuming the MHV M protein enters the virion envelope at position 26 (Rottier et a/., 1986) then the external amino-terminal portion is 28 amino acids for BCV, 21 for IBV, and 54 for TGEV. Within the first 54 amino acids there is one asparagine at position 32 that has the appropriate surrounding sequence required for N-linked glycosylation (Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981) the kind of glycosylation shown for the TGEV M protein (Jacobs et a/., 1986). Unlike the amino terminus of the MHV, BCV, and IBV proteins, the TGEV M protein is hydrophobic for the first 16 amino acids. Eleven of the sixteen terminal amino acids are hydrophobic, and amino acids at positions 2, 17, and 18 are charged (Fig. 4) . By inspection, this sequence has the properties of a cleavable amino-terminal signal peptide and from the \"-3, -1\" rule (von Heijne, 1986) peptidase cleavage would occur between amino acids 16 and 17.",

These results demonstrate that although the asparagine glycosylation site of both the full-length and truncated forms of M protein became translocated to the lumenal side of the microsome, translocation with the amino-terminal peptide present was far more efficient. Furthermore, translocation of the amino terminus appeared to be specifically enhanced by the peptide since carbonate treatment showed both full-length and truncated forms of the protein as a whole to be equally membrane embedded (Fig. 3C, lanes 5, 6,7, and 8) presumably as a result of internal translocation signals of the kind described for the MHV and IBV M proteins (Rottier et al., 1985; Machamer and Rose, 1987) .

The potentially cleavable N-terminal peptide was also revealed by the work of Laude et a/. (1987) in which a nearly identical M gene sequence was reported for the same strain of TGEV. In their sequence, bases in positions 375, 468, and 720 of Fig. 2 were T, C, and A, respectively, making the corresponding amino acids at these codon positions Val, Asn, and Asp. Furthermore, they obtained direct evidence that the N-terminal signal peptide was cleaved from the virion-associated M protein. At least two fundamental questions are therefore raised by the existence of an amino-terminal signal peptide in the TGEV M protein: (i) What is the evolutionary origin of such a sequence, and (ii) what role does the sequence play for the TGEV M protein?",

The nucleotide sequence encoding the amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence could have been eliminated by the polymerase as it copied the negative-strand template. (ii) There was no amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence in the primordial protein but the TGEV M protein acquired one during evolution. The polymerase during replication of the TGEV genome could have become dissociated and then reassociated with another minus-strand RNA template that carried the sequence for a hydrophobic signal. While negativestrand RNA of this kind is probably nonexistent or of low abundance in eucaryotic cells normally, it does exist in cells coinfected with another RNA virus. Conceivably the TGEV M protein could have acquired its amino-terminal sequence by copying the negative strand of another RNA virus. In this regard, it is interesting that 6 of the first 8 amino acids in the TGEV M sequence are identical to the VSV G protein signal sequence (Rose and Gallione, 1981) .",

The TGEV M protein without its amino-terminal signal peptide, as approximated by the translation product of the pGEM-M-2 construct which is 4 amino acids shorter than the polypeptide identified by the peptidase cleavage site (Laude et al., 1987) can translocate apparently by the use of an internal signal(s) of the type described for the MHV and IBV M proteins (Rottier et a/., 1985; Machamer and Rose, 1987) . It is interesting to note that even after removal of the amino-terminal peptide, the TGEV M protein extends 12 amino acids farther from the envelope than does BCV, 11 amino acids farther than MHV, and 16 amino acids farther than IBV. Perhaps the amino-terminal signal peptide, while not being an absolute requirement for translocation of the TGEV M protein, aids enough in the translocation of the additional external amino-terminal sequence that it was evolutionarily selected.",

Perhaps a step in virion assembly, for example, an interaction with another viral protein or viral RNA, may be required for cleavage to occur. Glycosylation of the M protein alone is apparently not a prerequisite for cleavage in vitro (Figs. 3A and B) but may be important in the in vivo context. Context is important for the cleavability of other signal peptides. For example, under certain constraints the potentially cleavable signal on the invariant (I?) chain of class II histocompatibility antigens (Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986) is not cleaved. We further propose that the M protein with an uncleaved signal peptide would have the orientation depicted in Fig. 5 . With this orientation, the cleavage site is buried in the membrane and fewer than 37 amino acids are exposed as a loop on the lumenal side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Once virion assembly begins, the cleavage site becomes exposed to the signal peptidase, cleavage occurs, and 37 amino acids, including a glycosylated asparagine, are left remaining on the virion surface. Because of the amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence, the TGEV M protein may behave differently than its MHV, BCV, or IBV counterparts with regard to intracellular trafficking.",

For this, the 8 amino acid sequence SWWSFNPE was important in making the initial alignment. Identical amino acids among all four proteins are boxed with a solid line. The 21 amino acid hydrophobic transmembrane regions of the MHV and IBV proteins are boxed with a hatched line (Rottier et a/., 1986) with the TGEV and BCV sequences drawn in parallel with MHV. Potential N-giycosylation sites (for TGEV and IBV) and 0-glycosylation sites (for BCV and MHV) are indicated with a solid circle above the amino acid. The signal peptide-like properties of the amino-terminal 16 amino acids is depicted. Within this region the 1 1 hydrophobic amino acids are underlined. The basic amino acids at positions 2 and 18 and the acidic amino acid at position 17 are indicated. The potential site for peptidase cleavage, according to the rules of Von Heinje (1986) is indicated by an open triangle.
