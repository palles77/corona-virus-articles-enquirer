Its influential barefoot doctor movement in the 1960s and 1970s served as an important inspiration for the Declaration of Alma-Ata. 3 4 However, with China's market-oriented reform since late 1970s, the barefoot doctor system gradually collapsed, and its healthcare evolved towards a system dominated by specialised hospital-based care. There are now a growing number of tertiary hospitals in China whose outpatient visits exceed ten or even twenty thousand per day.

Most articles, focusing on China's recent PHC initiative, tend to landscape the progress or provide a general account of China's newly-introduced GPs by using aggregated national official data -data that unfortunately are often misleading. There is a lack of rigorous, original investigations. Due to China's size, complexity and history, its official GPs may be considerably different, in terms of training, from their counterparts in high-income countries (Panel 1). Moreover, a fundamental factor affecting the viability of general practice in China is how General Practice is understood by prospective GPs. Our study focusses on how the three medical groups, together called the Policy Implementation Targets (PITs; Panel 1), understand the new GP system. If the PITs cannot agree on what being a GP entails, this compromises the policy foundation of China's GP aspirations. Our findings help inform priorities for establishing a viable GP system in China and may provide guidance for other countries embarking on a similar trajectory. ",

The first cohort of TRUMP students (in total 5000 nationally) enrolled at medical schools in 2010 and were required to join the GP-SRT in 2015.

All the questions used for the quantitative survey were derived from these codes/themes and FGDs, and were tested at the beginning of the second-round survey ( Figure 3 ) so that the questions were revised appropriately to be understood by the respondents in the same way they were understood by the researcher. In fact, the second-round survey also included further communications with relevant health officials, experts and previous interviewees -this allowed the interactive approach and the respondent validation of the qualitative study. 15 The coding framework continued to be fine-grained together with the second round of analysis (mainly quantitative analysis; Figure 3 ). This mixed methods approach is a 'fusion' of the qualitative and quantitative elements so that they 'fulfil' one another to reach reliability and robustness.\" Then quantitative data were cleaned and analysed using Stata 12. Standard summary statistics were reported about PITs' understanding of GPs. Chi-square statistics were used to test statistical significance of the consensus among the three groups. [16] [17] [18] This study is the first to use original primary data from all the three GP-related groups in China, to examine their characteristics and understanding of general practice through rigorous descriptive analysis and significance testing.",

This either reflects the government's misunderstanding of GPs or its deliberate rhetoric to avoid directly associating the GPs' role as a barrier to directly accessing tertiary care. Accordingly, agreeing with this statement does not necessarily mean the PITs understand GPs' referral role appropriately.

Nonetheless, Participant 1's understanding of public health is not appropriate either. Great caution is needed to decipher how they interpret public health. Meanwhile, most PITs, although asserting GPs' main responsibility is public health, do not agree that GPs' main role is prevention rather than diagnosis/treatment of disease (Table 4 ). However, township hospital doctors are more likely than the medical students or residents surveyed to consider a GPs main role to be prevention. It is fair to say that the PITs have a vague understanding of both general practice and public health. ",

This phenomenon relates to the everyday work of China's primary care doctors -the more one has exposure to the work designated as so-called 'general practice' in real life, the more confused one gets.

However, in practice, some work of GPs may inevitably overlaps with many specialists, especially from an international perspective. In the UK, the primary care doctors are GPs, while in the US they consist of family physicians (US equivalents of GPs), general internists, paediatricians, obstetricians and gynaecologists. Furthermore, many attributes of GPs such as comprehensiveness, continuity, first contact and coordination are all relative concepts -sometimes they do not necessarily and automatically distinguish GPs from specialists. For instance, some specialists with an office-based tradition in the US (such as some cardiologists and pulmonologists) actually identify themselves as primary care physicians, 22 and some research recognises the important contribution of specialists to primary care -in particular 58.2%, 43.8% and 42.3% of the care provided by cardiologists, gastroenterologists and pulmonologists, respectively, is classified into the category of principal care which has the evidence of continuity and comprehensiveness. 23 Conversely, GPs can work in tertiary hospitals. In Canada, 90% of the hospitalists (providing comprehensive care for inpatients) are GPs. 24 Moreover, the broad care provided by GPs may overlap with allied health professionals such as nurses and community health workers. In the UK, the consultations in general practice undertaken by nurses increased from 21% in 1995 to 34% in 2006; more responsibilities previously undertaken by GPs are taken over by nurses. 21 All in all, the work delegation and substitution indicates that there are potentially various combinations of health workforce (GPs, specialists, allied health professionals, etc.) to deliver PHC. Depending on these different combinations and different health delivery systems, different countries actually demand different things from general practice, as reflected by the large variation of the proportion of GPs as a percentage of each country's total number of doctors: UK 60%, Canada 51%, France 50%, Spain 37%, Netherland 33%, Finland 32%, Denmark 25%, USA 20%, Germany 19% and Sweden 10%. 25 26 No research so far has proposed a convincing gold standard establishing the 'ideal' proportion of GPs. Accordingly, it becomes so complex and confusing in China when such a large and diverse country in transition learns the \"successful\" experiences across various countries. Also, more special in China is the role of TCM. This paper does not want to enter the endless debate of western medicine vs. TCM or want to deny the potential huge contribution of TCM to PHC. We just find that at this stage TCM further compromises the understanding of general practice in China. Recognising the reality, instead of the obsession with GPs, it is probably better for China to develop its own multi-professional team-based approach to deliver PHC. The 'team' can involve GPs, other generalist physicians, nurses, and even nurse practitioners (very new to China), etc. Obviously, this team-based approach can also accommodate TCM practitioners very well.",

Nationwide compulsory residency called the Standardised Residency Training (SRT) is new to China, and the GP-SRT is an important part of this. The SRT recruited its first cohort of residents (totalling 55,000) in late 2014 and around 10% of them (5,158) joined the GP-SRT. 5 The second programme involves a Tuition-waived Rural-oriented Undergraduate Medical Programme (TRUMP). TRUMP sponsors medical students from rural China who in return assume GP positions in assigned township hospitals upon completion of their studies. The first cohort of TRUMP students (in total 5000 nationally) enrolled at medical schools in 2010 and were required to join the GP-SRT in 2015. Upon completion of the GP-SRT, they are required to work in township hospitals as GPs for three years.",

Refining the framework involved constant comparison and discussion with PA. All the questions used for the quantitative survey were derived from these codes/themes and FGDs, and were tested at the beginning of the second-round survey (Figure 3 ) so that the questions were revised appropriately to be understood by the respondents in the same way they were understood by the researcher. In fact, the second-round survey also included further communications with relevant health officials, experts and previous interviewees -this allowed the interactive approach and the respondent validation of the qualitative study. 15 The coding framework continued to be fine-grained together with the second round of analysis (mainly quantitative analysis; Figure 3 ). This mixed methods approach is a 'fusion' of the qualitative and quantitative elements so that they 'fulfil' one another to reach reliability and robustness.\" Then quantitative data were cleaned and analysed using Stata 12. Standard summary statistics were reported about PITs' understanding of GPs. Chi-square statistics were used to test statistical significance of the consensus among the three groups.

            "text": "Theoretically, it is easy to understand that comprehensiveness and first-contact care requires GPs to deal with a much larger variety of problems, while specialists focus in depth in one clinical domain. However, in practice, some work of GPs may inevitably overlaps with many specialists, especially from an international perspective. In the UK, the primary care doctors are GPs, while in the US they consist of family physicians (US equivalents of GPs), general internists, paediatricians, obstetricians and gynaecologists. Furthermore, many attributes of GPs such as comprehensiveness, continuity, first contact and coordination are all relative concepts -sometimes they do not necessarily and automatically distinguish GPs from specialists. For instance, some specialists with an office-based tradition in the US (such as some cardiologists and pulmonologists) actually identify themselves as primary care physicians, 22 and some research recognises the important contribution of specialists to primary care -in particular 58.2%, 43.8% and 42.3% of the care provided by cardiologists, gastroenterologists and pulmonologists, respectively, is classified into the category of principal care which has the evidence of continuity and comprehensiveness. 23 Conversely, GPs can work in tertiary hospitals. In Canada, 90% of the hospitalists (providing comprehensive care for inpatients) are GPs. 24 Moreover, the broad care provided by GPs may overlap with allied health professionals such as nurses and community health workers. In the UK, the consultations in general practice undertaken by nurses increased from 21% in 1995 to 34% in 2006; more responsibilities previously undertaken by GPs are taken over by nurses. 21 All in all, the work delegation and substitution indicates that there are potentially various combinations of health workforce (GPs, specialists, allied health professionals, etc.) to deliver PHC. Depending on these different combinations and different health delivery systems, different countries actually demand different things from general practice, as reflected by the large variation of the proportion of GPs as a percentage of each country's total number of doctors: UK 60%, Canada 51%, France 50%, Spain 37%, Netherland 33%, Finland 32%, Denmark 25%, USA 20%, Germany 19% and Sweden 10%. 25 26 No research so far has proposed a convincing gold standard establishing the 'ideal' proportion of GPs. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   21 Accordingly, it becomes so complex and confusing in China when such a large and diverse country in transition learns the \"successful\" experiences across various countries. Also, more special in China is the role of TCM. This paper does not want to enter the endless debate of western medicine vs. TCM or want to deny the potential huge contribution of TCM to PHC. We just find that at this stage TCM further compromises the understanding of general practice in China. Recognising the reality, instead of the obsession with GPs, it is probably better for China to develop its own multi-professional team-based approach to deliver PHC. The 'team' can involve GPs, other generalist physicians, nurses, and even nurse practitioners (very new to China), etc. Obviously, this team-based approach can also accommodate TCM practitioners very well.",

This 'case study' provides at least an initial view of the kinds of issues that probably arise in crafting policies for General Practice in other provinces of China. In addition, this paper only provides a 'supply-side' perspective -it represents the views of medical providers. However, it is equally important to know patients' attitude towards general practice ('demand-side' perspective) and their health care-seeking behaviours. However, our design is first to target relevant providers who are supposed to understand GPs best. If the PITs have such understandings/interpretations of what being a GP entails, as identified in the five themes, the perspectives of the general public should be even more diverse.

Specialists, nurses, community health workers, public health professionals, and TCM practitioners, among others, need to be coordinated. Especially, China should make sure that the paramount identity of GPs is firstly qualified doctors, and clarify pragmatically the distinction between general practice and public health. In addition, pursuing a particular indicator of policy success (e.g. the number of GPs) alone can be meaningless or even counterproductive. Inserting so-called GPs into the existing hospital-and specialist-dominated system can lead to chaos and confusion.

Most articles, focusing on China's recent PHC initiative, tend to landscape the progress or provide a general account of China's newly-introduced GPs by using aggregated national official data -data that unfortunately are often misleading. There is a lack of rigorous, original investigations. Due to China's size, complexity and history, its official GPs may be considerably different, in terms of training, from their counterparts in high-income countries (Box 1). Moreover, a fundamental factor affecting the viability of general practice in China is how General Practice is understood by prospective GPs. Our study focusses on how the three medical groups, together called the Policy Implementation Targets (PITs; Box 1), understand the new GP system. If the PITs cannot agree on what being a GP entails, this compromises the policy foundation of China's GP aspirations. Our findings help inform priorities for establishing a viable GP system in China and may provide guidance for other countries embarking on a similar trajectory.",
