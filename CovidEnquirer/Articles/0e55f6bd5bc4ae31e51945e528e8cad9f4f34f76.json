            "text": "Alveolar macrophages (AM) infected with Pseudorabies virus (PRV) were compared to noninfected AM for cytotoxicity against foreign or transformed cells and production of interferon (IFN). Five PRV strains were used to infect AM including strains that are known to be highly virulent for pigs, i.e. strain 4892 and strain S-62 as well as strains that are regarded as mild or nonvirulent, i.e. BUK and Bartha. The multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.005 to 0.05 TCID~o/cell. The target cells in the cytotoxicity assays were either chicken red blood cells, PRV-infeeted vero cells, or human myeloblastoma cells (K562 cell line). For the producton of IFN, AM cultures were treated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I :C) diluted in tissue culture media at a concentration of 5/~g/106cells. Culture supernatants were collected at various times poststimulation and tested for antiviral activity using the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus replication inhibition test. Swine AM were able to lyse chicken red blood cells in an antibody-independent way but not in an antibody-dependent way, whereas lysis of PRV-infected vero cells was accomplished both ways. The cytotoxicity against chicken red blood cells was reduced in the PRV-infected AM as compared to noninfeeted cells, particularly in AM infected with virulent PRV strains. Specific 5tCr release values for AM infected with S-62 and 4892 strains were 14 and 19, while the noninfected AM had values of 36. Similarly, in the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity assay against PRV-infected vero cells there was no activity of AM against K562 cells. The production of IFN was readily stimulated with Poly I:C. The optimal time for supernatant collection was between 12 and 16 h poststimulation. The antiviral activity was abrogated by treatment of the supernatant with antiserum against human leukocyte IFN; it was therefore considered to be due to interferon-alpha (IFNa) released from the macrophages. The antiviral activity present in supernatants of PRV-infeeted AM was reduced compared to noninfeeted AM. The difference between AM cultures infected with virulent strains of PRV and noninfected AM cultures was statistically significant at P ~< 0.025. The results provide support to the premise that the role of AM in lung defense can be compromised by PRV infection.",

            "text": "Pseudorabies virus (PRV), also known as Aujeszky's disease virus, is a widespread swine pathogen. Clinical disease in swine varies depending on the age of the animal and the virus strain involved. In general, young pigs are more prone to acute disease with high mortality rates, whereas in mature animals, morbidity and mortality are reduced [I]. In growingfinishing pigs, the disease often includes respiratory problems caused either by the virus itself or by secondary pathogens such as P~teurella multocida or Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae [2, 3] . The alveolar macrophage (AM) is considered to be fundamental in the defense of the respiratory tract particularly in the bronchioli and alveoli levels where the ciliated epithelium is lacking. The AM activities include phagocytosis and killing of bacteria, cytotoxicity against infected or transformed cells, and production of monokines [4, 5] . There is evidence that pseudorabies spreads widely in the respiratory tract from the tonsils down to the alveolar space; Narita et al. [6] reported finding PRV inside AM in tissue sections from intranasally-inoculated pigs. Additionally, in vitro experiments have shown that AM are susceptible to PRV, and that infected cells are less capable to carry out some of the killing activities that follow phagocytosis such as the oxidative burst [7] . Other important activities of the AM are independent from the phagocytic activity but are also essential in lung clearance, i.e. secretory activities and cytotoxicity against transformed, infected or foreign cells. The main objective of the work presented here was to evaluate the ability of PRV infected AM to lyse foreign, infected or transformed cells and to display antiviral activity. It is known that PRV infection eventually kills AM. It was previously reported that AM infected at m.o.i, of 3 were effectively evaluated as effector cells when used immediately after infection whereas at 24 and 48 h postinfection the cell viability was so reduced that it was difficult to compare the efficiency of PRV-infected or noninfected AM as effector cells [8] . The evaluation of cytotoxicity and synthesis of IFN reported in this work were carried out immediately after infection, and the m.o.i.(s) used were chosen in a way that the time of assay would be coincidental with the time that replication and spread to noninfected cells were likely to occur. The target cells selected had all been used in cytotoxicity assays with swine leukocytes. The mechanisms of recognition and destruction that are active against each type of cell are presumed to be different from each other [9] [10] [11] .",

The assays against K562 included control-wells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from age-matched pigs. All assays included a set of wells containing only media and target cells that were later lysed for the 100% cytotoxicity value. Wells with no effector cells of any kind provided the value of spontaneous lysis. After the incubation period, supernatant samples (0.1 ml) were collected and counted in a gamma counter.

The activity was measured by reduction of plaques caused by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in vero cells. The antiviral activity was not detected in the supernatant of nontreated cultures, and it was still detected after dialysis against a pH 2.4 buffer for 18 h followed by dialysis with a pH 7.5 buffer. Since the antiviral activity was satisfactorily detected in primate cells, it was not limited to swine cells, thus it was considered to be due to type alpha interferon. In order to find out the optimum time for supernatant collection as well as whether PRV infection of AM will affect the synthesis of IFN~, a quantitative assessment of antiviral activity was developed following the microtiter procedure described by Pedersen et al. [14] . Briefly, vero cell monolayers were plated in 96-well microtiter plates 6-14 h in advance in order to have a monolayer of cells already formed for the testing. The tissue culture media was removed from the mono[ayers and replaced with AM cultures supernatant diluted in tissue culture media 100 ~l/well. The cultures were incubated for 2 h at 37C, then 100 ~1 of tissue culture media containing 20-50 TCIDs0 of VSV were added to each well. All samples were tested in quadruplicate. In all plates there were six wells with no supernatant sample, but virus as positive virus-induced cell destruction control, and six wells with no virus as cell control. The plates were incubated at 37:C for 24-36 h. The replication of VSV within cells was assessed with a dye uptake procedure described by Everitt and Wohlfart [! 5]. The plates were read in an ELISA reader using a 570 nm filter. The values of each set of wells were averaged, the values of each sample dilution were divided by the value of the positive control (only virus) and then plotted against dilution. It was noticed that the linearity of the curve was lost at very high or very low dilutions, but it was consistent in the range of dilutions from i : 5 to 1 : 20. The results are reported as the calculated value at 1 : 5 after plotting the values of four or more dilutions and calculating a regression line, The test was used also to evaluate the antiviral activity present in supernatants of cultured AM from six pigs, those supernatants were evaluated before and after reacting with antibodies against human leukocyte IFN (SIGMA, St Louis, Mo).",

After the incubation period allowed for virus adsorption (1 h at 37\u00b0C), the virus inoculum was removed, and tissue culture media containing Poly I : C was added to each well 1 ml/well. A minimum of three cultures were infected with each strain. The supernatants from the cultures were collected at 20h poststimulation and stored frozen until assayed. The potential presence of infectious PRV in the samples to be tested required neutralization of virus infectivity. It was accomplished by adding pig anti-PRV sera (final dilution 1 : 10) to the sample dilutions and letting it incubate for at least 2 h at 37\u00b0C before testing the sample on vero cells. The media containing pig serum that was used for dilutions was also used for the control (no sample) wells. The experiment was repeated on five different occasions using cells from different pigs. The significance of the difference between infected and noninfected cells was determined using an analysis of variance following the complete randomized block design where each pig was one block [16] .",

            "text": "The results presented here showed that swine AM were active against CRBC only in an antibody-independent assay. Peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells showed positive cytotoxicity values indicating that the antibodies against CRBC were able to mediate ADCC, but AM were not active in such mechanism. Previously reported results showed that ADCC activity of lung cells from newborn pigs against CRBC was carried out by neutrophils present in lung-lavage fluid. In fact, there was a marked contrast in activity between samples from newborn and from 3-day-old pigs due to the shift in cell population; it was mainly neutrophils in newborn pigs [10]. In piglets as well as in mature animals, the proportion of neutrophils in lung-lavage cells is very low. Antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against PRV-infected cells has been described with many types of effector cells, including lung-lavage cells [8, l l] . El-awar and Hanh [8] compared cells from young pigs (4-6 days old) to cells of mature pigs and found both populations were active in ADCC, and in both cases, PRV infection had an effect upon the activity. In our experiments, we compared three strains of virus, and it was noticed that similar to cytotoxicity against CRBC, the strains known to be virulent caused a reduction in the AM cytotoxicity. Antibody-independent cytotoxicity of AM against virus-infected cells has been described in other systems. Parainfluenza-3 infected calf kidney cells that were destroyed by lung-lavage cells from cattle [17] . Another system where such activity has been described was cells infected with infectious bovine rihnotracheitis virus [18] . In the case of pseudorabies, it is known that lymphocytes from lung-lavage were active against PRVinfected cells. Even though the activity was much lower as compared to peripheral blood lymphocytes, it was highly specific for virus-infected cells because the noninfected cells were not affected [19] . The fact that in our experiments some of the activity was carried out by lymphocytes cannot be ruled out, but it is unlikely to be the main active population because the proportion of lymphocytes in the effector cell population was very low. So it can be assumed that AM have a low rate of activity. Even though the infected AM had less activity as compared to the noninfected AM, the low values obtained in the specific release of chromium makes it difficult to have a reliable assessment of the effect of PRV infection upon this activity. It is quite possible that AM in culture release a variety of cytokines and more than one could have antiviral activity. Some preliminary testing, therefore, was required. The antiviral activity detected in the supernatants of AM cultures was inducible by stimulation with Poly I : C, resistant to pH 2.0, not restricted to homologous cells, and it was reduced by treatment with antibodies against human leukocyte IFN which is known to cross react with swine IFN~t [20] . Therefore, such activity was considered to be mainly due to IFNct. The activity most often associated with IFN, as well as the main criteria for evaluation, is the induction of resistance to virus infection. There are, however, many other activities in which IFNs are also involved. Phagocytosis of bacteria by AM and blood monocytes was enhanced after incubating the cells with homologous IFN [21] , as well as the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of AM [I 8] . Porcine monocytes and porcine AM were rendered less permissive to African swine fever virus infection by treatment with bovine IFN [22] . It is clear that the production of IFN is an important component in the surveillance role carried out by the AM. It has been suggested that IFN has a role in the variations of virulence seen among herpes simplex virus (HSV) strains, For instance, Shimizu et al. [23] compared two HSV-l variants. One was able to cause lethal infection of mice; the other did not cause lethal infection. The replication in culture of the latter was inhibited by anti-HSV antibodies, and it was highly sensitive to mouse IFN. In a different experiment, Brucher et al. [24] compared the replication of HSV in cells from susceptible or nonsusceptible mice. It was found that monocytes from susceptible mice supported virus replication more readily and produced less IFN as compared to monocytes from HSV-resistant mice. In the case of PRV, there was a report about attenuated strains being more sensitive to IFN and better IFN inducers as compared to virulent strains [25] . The experiments reported here, did not compare sensitivity to IFN, but there was indeed a significant difference between strains in the ability to lessen synthesis of IFN in cells stimulated with Poly I:C. The strains known to produce acute disease in swine were able tO reduce the synthesis of IFN, while the effect caused by other strains was not statistically significant.",
