To generate and maintain these domains, cells must be capable of distinguishing among newly synthesized membrane proteins and of ensuring that they are concentrated at their sites of ultimate functional residence. In many cases, this sorting process appears to occur during the course of a protein's initial transit through the organelles of the biosynthetic processing pathway, before its first appearance at the plasma membrane Matlin and Simons, 1984; Misek et al., 1984; Pfeiffer et al., 1985) . Evidence from other systems indicates that sorting can involve selective stabilization at a plasmalemmal domain, subsequent to a protein's random delivery to both cell surfaces (Hammerton et al., 1991) . Whether sorting takes place at the level of the Golgi or at the plasmalemma, this process must make use of sorting information, or sorting signals embedded within the structure of the sorted protein itself. These signals are interpreted by the cellular sorting machinery and thus serve to dictate each polypeptide's ultimate subcellular distribution.",

            "text": "Efforts to characterize sorting signals have generally involved the generation of chimeric or truncated constructs prepared from portions of apical and basolateral membrane proteins. Through analysis of the subcellular distributions of the resulting proteins, portions of the parent molecules necessary for the sorting process have been identified. Over the past several years, a large number of such chimeric/ truncated proteins have been prepared, but only a few general rules have emerged from this work. It has been shown that the cytosolic tails of several basolateral proteins possess basolateral sorting signals (Casanova et al., 1991; Hunziker et al., 1991) , while the ectodomains of a number of apical polypeptides seem to carry targeting information (McQueen et al., 1986; Mostov et al., 1987; Roth et al., 1987) . Recent evidence also indicates that sequences which allow proteins to be endocytosed can double as basolateral sorting signals (Hunziker et al., 1991; LeBivic et al., 1991; Brewer and Roth, 1991) . The resolving capacity of these methods has been limited in part by the necessity to generate chimeras from portions of unrelated polypeptides. The tertiary structures of the resultant chimeras are thus likely to differ substantially from those of either parent molecule, which may exert unpredictable effects on sorting behavior. To avoid this potential problem, we have chosen to apply the chimera approach to a novel example of two proteins which share an extremely high degree of structural and functional similarity and are sorted to distinct compartments of polarized epithelial cells.",

The Na,K-ATPase, or sodium pump, is a component of the basolateral plasma membranes of many epithelia (Marlin and Caplan, 1992) . In contrast, the highly homologous H,K-ATPase is restricted to the apical membrane and related structures in its native gastric parietal cells (Smolka and Weinstein, 1986) . Both ATPases are composed of I00 kD ct subunits (which are 62 % identical to one another, see Fig. 1 ) and richly glycosylated /3 subunits (which manifest \"~31% identity) (Jorgensen, 1982; Okamoto et al., 1990; Reuben et al., 1990; . While the pumps' catalytic functions appear to be accomplished by their alpha subunits 0orgensen, 1982), assembly of the tx//3 heterodimer appears to be a prerequisite for cell surface delivery as well as functional activity (Ackermann and Geering, 1990) . Our studies take advantage of the structural homology relating these ATPases in order to examine the molecular signals underlying their differential localizations. Because these proteins share a highly conformation-dependent catalytic cycle, the potential exists to assay the enzymatic activity and hence the structural integrity of each chimeric protein. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to the Na,K-ATPase, both subunits of the H,K-ATPase encode dominant information specifying accumulation at the apical membrane.",

Monolayers were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with one or a combination of the following monospecific antibodies: anti-H,K-ATPase a (HK9 diluted 1:100), anti-Na,K-ATPase ct (mAb 6H diluted 1:100), anti-Na,K-ATPase/~ (mAb 8A 1:100), and anti-H,K-ATPase ~/(kindly provided by J. Forte (University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA), diluted at 1:1,000). FITC conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and rhodamine conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Boehringer-Mannheim Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) secondary antibodies were used for 1 h at room temperature at a 1:100 dilution. Monolayers were washed in low ionic strength detergent-free buffer (10 mM NaPi pH 7.5) for 10 min before mounting the filters in a 75% glyeerol/PBS solution containing 0.1% p-pbenylenediamine to retard FITC bleaching. En face immunofluorescence images were visualized using the Zeiss Axiophot microscope and photographed using Kodak T-MAX 100 ASA film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Confocal images were generated with a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope.",

En face (Fig. 4 , A and B) and confocal optical sectioning (C and D) confirm that both subunits of the H,K-ATPase immunolocalize predominantly to the apical brush border. The normal basolateral distributions of both the ct and/3 subunits of the endogenous Na,K-ATPase remain unperturbed in these cells (E-J). Thus, this cell line is able to distinguish the H,K-ATPase tx//3 complex from the Na,K-ATPase ix//3 complex and to maintain each on its appropriate and distinct membrane domain. Efforts to employ surface labeling techniques to quantify the surface distributions of these pump subunits have been frustrated by our observation that these methods cannot be applied quantitatively to LLC-PK~ cells, due to marked differences in labeling efficiency at the two surface domains (Gottardi and Caplan, 1992) . Consequently, we have employed quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy in order to measure the polarized distributions of pump molecules. Because cells are fixed and Figure 3 . Immunodetection of H,K-ATPase a and/3 subunits in stably transfected LLC-PK~ cells. Equal amounts of membrane protein (20 ~,g) from untransfected (lanes I, 3, 6, and 11), H,K-ATPase/3 transfected (lanes 5, 8, and 10), and H,K-ATPase a/ /3 cotransfected LLC-PK~ cells (lanes 2, 4, 7, and 9) were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Nitrocellulose strips were probed with the following antibodies: (lanes 1 and 2) H,K-ATPasc a-specific antibody (HKg); (lanes 3-5) mAb specific for the Na,K-ATPasc a subunit; (lanes 6-8) mAb specific for the Na,K-ATPase /3 subunit; (lanes 9-15) mAb specific for the H,K-ATPase /3 subunit. Specific bands were detected with an anti-rabbit or mouse peroxidase secondary and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Corp.). Lanes 12-15 (20/~g total protein from H,K-ATPase/3 transfected LLC-PKt cells) demonstrate that the 66and 42-kD bands detected with the H,K-ATPasc/3 specific antibody, are in fact the mature and core glycosylated forms, respectively Lane 16 represents a cell surface immunoprecipitation of the H,K-ATPase/3 protein from [35S]methionine labeled H,K-ATPase B-transfected LLC-PKt cells. The apical to basolateral (A/B) fluorescence intensity ratios were calculated according to the formula described in Methods. Salas et al., 1987) . As can be seen in Table I , the ratio of apical/basolateral signal is 42.1 and 31.2 for H,K-ATPase ot and/3 subunits, respectively. Co-expression of the H,K-ATPase ot and/3 subunits appears to be necessary in order to ensure the ot-subunit's surface delivery. While we have been unable to generate a cell line that expresses only the H,K-ATPase c~ subunit, transient transfection studies in COS-1 cells demonstrate that the H,K-ATPase ot can only be expressed on the cell surface when it is co-transfected with its H,K-ATPase/3 subunit (Gottardi, C., and M. J. Caplan, manuscript submitted for publication). This observation strongly suggests that the pump subunits exhibit strict fidelity with respect to assembly, since Na,K-ATPase/3 does not appear to chaperone H,K-ATPase ot to the cell surface. This conclusion, which argues against the formation of hybrid pump dimers, is further supported by the observed spatial segregation of H,K-ATPase from Na,K-ATPase subunit polypeptides in the LLC-PK1 cell line. . Monolayers were fixed in methanol and permeabilized in a Triton X-100 buffer and processed for immunofluorescence as described in Methods. The H,K-ATPase a polyclonal antibody (HK9) was visualized with an anti-rabbit rhodamine conjugated secondary; Na,K-ATPase or,/3 and H,K-ATPase/5 monoclonal antibodies were detected with an anti-mouse FITC conjugated secondary. K, L, and M show staining patterns with H,K-ATPase c~, Na,K-ATPase c~ and Na,K-ATPase/5, respectively, on untransfected control cells. A and B and C and D represent enface and confocal views of H,K-ATPase ot and H,K-ATPase/5 double-labeled cells. E and F and G and H represent en face and confocal views of H,K-ATPase \u00a2x and Na,K-ATPase ot double-labeled ceils. The I and J pair is double labeled with antibodies of H,K-ATPase ot and Na,K-ATPase/5 subunits. The confocal xz sections display arrows above and below the staining pattern to denote apical and basolateral membrane domains.",

To test this hypothesis, we have prepared a stably transfected LLC-PKt cell line which expresses a high level of the H519N chimera (Figs. I and 6). Western blots probed with the HK9 antibody ( Fig. 2) reveal the presence of a strong immunoreactive band at ~100 kD in transfected cells that is not present in control cells (Fig.  6 , lanes I and 2). This chimeric protein has the same mobility as the full length H,K-ATPase ot subunit and is not detected with an antibody directed against the carboxy half of the H,K-ATPase (mAb kindly provided by A. Smolka, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, data not shown). The tertiary structure of the H519N chimera appears to be largely intact, because it is functionally active as an ion-transporting ATPase, sensitive to both SCH28080 and ouabain, which are inhibitors of the H,K-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase, respectively (Blostein et al., 1993) . Indirect immunofluorescence and quantitative confocal microscopy were employed in order to determine the cell surface distribution of this chimera. Fig. 7 shows that the H519N chimera is almost exclusively localized to the apical membrane (Fig. 7 , A and C) with an average apical/ basolateral ratio of ~ 30:1 (Table I) . The endogenous Na,K-ATPase ~ subunit maintains its steady-state basolateral distribution, demonstrating that expression of this chimera does not alter the steady-state distribution of this similar protein (Fig. 7, A and B , E; Table I ). Interestingly, the Na,K-ATPase /~ subunit colocalizes both with the chimera at the apical brush border as well as with the Na,K-ot subunit at the basolateral surface (Fig. 7 , C and D, G; Table I ). Both the chimera and the Na,K-ATPase/3 subunit are actually intercalated in the apical membrane and are exposed at the apical surface. This fact is demonstrated by incubating the mono- Figure 6 .

Lanes 1 and 2 were probed with the H,K-ATPase ct antibody (HK9), lanes 3 and 4 with mAb Na,K-ATPase a, and lanes 5 and 6 with mAb Na,K-ATPase/~. Lanes 7 and 8 represent a longer exposure of lanes 5 and 6to show that the steady-state levels of mature (55 kD) Na,K-ATPase ~ differ markedly between transfected and untransfected cells. Serial dilution analysis enabled us to determine that there is a fourfold difference in levels of mature Na,K-ATPase subtmit present in the two cell lines (data not shown). . Monolayers were fixed in methanol and permeabilized in a Triton X-100 buffer and processed for immunofluorescence as described in Materials and Methods.

Taken together, these results suggest that the cell surface expression of this chimeric tx subunlt requires assembly with the Na,K-ATPase/3 subunit. This conclusion is further supported by COS cell expression studies (Gottardi, C. , and M. J. Caplan, manuscript submitted for publication) which demonstrate that H519N can arrive at the cell surface when expressed alone, whereas the complementary chimera, N519H, as well as native H,K-ATPase ot require co-expression with H,K-ATPase/3 subunit. Proof of co-assembly of these proteins must await the results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The results in Fig. 7 further demonstrate that the Na,K-ATPase/3 subunit does not encode dominant cell sur~ face localization information. It would appear that the amino-terminal half of the H,K-ATPase t~ subunit, and not only the H,K-ATPase/3 subunit, must encode an apical localization signal which is able to function when expressed as part of a chimeric construct. These results are also consistent with the possibility that the amino-terminal portion of the Na,K-ATPase ot subunit encodes a dominant basolateral signal which is not present in the chimera. Finally, it appears that the carboxy-terminal portion of an ot subunit determines /3 subunit assembly preference. We note that in cells which express the H519N chimera, the steady-state levels of the endogenous Na,K-ATPase/3 subunit are increased fourfold over untransfected cells (Fig.  6, lanes 7 and 8) . Conversely, cell lines which express the H,K-ATPase/3 subunit consistently show lower steady-state levels of endogenous Na,K-ATPase/3 subunit (Fig. 3 , lanes 6-8). The possible stabilization or biosynthetic regulation of endogenous subunits as a result of exogenous subunit expression is currently being investigated.",

The DAB reaction product can be seen at the apical membrane, along the microviUi (opened arrows) and within coated pits (inset), in addition to structures that resemble the recycling portions of tubular endosomes (black arrows).

            "text": "To further characterize these structures, we wished to determine whether this compartment could be loaded with a fluid phase endocytosis marker such as HRP (Fig. 9) . Fluid phase markers can be found in early endosomes within 5 min and late endosomes/lysosomes within 20 min of their internalization (Stoorvogel et al., 1991) . Stably transfected cells expressing solely the H,K-ATPase ~ subunit (Fig. 3) were incubated with the H,K-ATPase/3 mAb at 4\u00b0C to prebind reactive epitopes at the apical cell surface. After the cells were rewarmed to 37\u00b0C in the presence of HRP for various lengths of time they were fixed, permeabilized and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. As can be seen in Fig. 9 (A, C, E, and G), prebinding with the H,K-ATPase /~ antibody produces a clear cell surface pattern that gives way to a punctate, vesicular localization after the cells have been incubated for various lengths of time. As early as 10 min both HRP and H,K-ATPase/3 colocalize within the same intracellular compartment (Fig. 9, C and D) . They continue to colocalize for as long as 45 min after warming the cells (Fig.  9, G and H) . The structure they occupy is not labeled by antibodies to LGP 120, a lysosomal marker (data not shown; Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989) . It seems likely, therefore, that the H,K-ATPase/3 positive vesicles can be derived from the cell surface and thus represent an endosomal compartment. While the pattern observed in these uptake experiments is virtually indistinguishable from the steady-state vesicular pattern seen in fixed permeabilized cells (Fig. 5 C) , we cannot rule out that a subpopulation of these vesicles may represent a post-golgi/preapical compartment. The H,K-ATPase /3 in the intracellular vesicles observed in these experiments is unlikely to have been internalized as a result of crosslinking effected by our bivalent mAb, because a large literature suggests that bivalent rnAbs (e.g., Hopkins, 1983 ) and noncross-linking antibodies (e.g., Lazarovits and Roth, 1988) fail to induce endocytosis of surface bound molecules which lack endocytosis signals.",

Our efforts to carry out biosynthetic targeting assays in this system have been complicated by several factors.

The recently reported detection of random sodium pump delivery in MDCK cells (Hammerton et al., 1991) may be referenceable to differences in the particular subclone of MDCK cells used (Siemens, C.

In the context of these studies, which reconfirm the earlier conclusion that the Na,K-ATPase is competent to serve as a substrate for vectorial targeting in MDCK cells, we believe that the H,K-ATPase and the chimeric subunits are likely to be sorted intracellularly and vectorially targeted in LLC-PKt cells. While it is true that our analysis of the steady-state distributions of these ion pump and pump chimera molecules does not allow us to draw conclusions with respect to the pathways these molecules follow, our experiments do, however, establish domains of these pumps which are necessary for ensuring their steady state distributions. Whether the signal domains we have described are interpreted at the level of the Golgi, or serve to anchor these proteins at one or the other surface domain after random delivery, they are clearly necessary and sufficient to ensure the ultimate polarized distributions of their parent proteins.",

To our surprise, we found that both the oe and/3 proteins encode information which specifies apical accumulation. The contribution of the H,K-ATPase ot subunit is revealed in the cell surface localization of the H,K-ATPase/Na,K-ATPase. chimera, H519N. This protein comprises the amino-terminal half of the H,K-ATPase and the carboxy-half of the Na,K-ATPase and assembles exclusively with the endogenous Na,K-ATPase/3 subunlt. The resulting complex localizes predominantly to the apical brush border of transfected LLC-PK~ cells, suggesting that a dominant apical localization signal may reside within the amino-half of the H,K-ATPase. As can be seen in Fig. l, <20% of the H519N chimera is encoded by amino acids unique to the H,K-ATPase. Furthermore, analysis of the Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase sequences reveals a single region of extensive nonhomology . The amino terminus of the H,K-ATPase a extends 13 residues beyond that of the Na,K-ATPase a. Significant identities are not found until residue 23 of the H,K-ATPase sequence. It is therefore possible that this unique amino acid sequence encodes the information that constitutes the signal which ultimately accounts for the apical steady-state distribution of this protein. It is interesting to note that a colonic isoform of the H,K-ATPase, which is 63 % identical to the gastric H,K-ATPase and is also localized to the apical membrane, shares an 8 amino acid stretch of identity in this amino terminal region (Crowson and Shull, 1992) . Chimeric constructs which will test this hypothesis are currently being generated.",

            "text": "It has been speculated that these pumps' 13 subunits may somehow be necessary for escorting a subunits to specific cell surface domains. Our results show that this is not the case for the Na,K-ATPase 13 subunit. The data presented in Fig. 7 demonstrate that the H519N chimera colocalizes with an endogenous Na,K-ATPase 13 subunit at the apical cell surface. Because the Na,K-ATPase 15 subunit colocalizes with both the HS19N chimera at the apical membrane, as well as with the endogenous Na,K-ATPase cx at the basolateral membrane, we conclude that this 13 subunit is unlikely to encode a dominant distribution-determining signal. The behavior of the H,K-ATPase 13 subunit ('~31% identical to rat Na,K-ATPase/3~; Reuben et al., 1990) , however, is markedly different and supports the argument that at least this/3 subunit possesses a localization signal. When expressed by itself or in concert with H,K-ATPase c~, the H,K-ATPase/3 localizes to the apical brush border as well as to elements of the endocytic pathway (Figs. 5, 8, and 9) . The presence of H,K-ATPase 13 in components of the endocytic apparatus suggests the existence of an endocytosis signal within the 36 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of this polypeptide (Goldstein et al., 1985) . As can be seen in Fig. 10 , the H,K-ATPase IS shares with the transferrin receptor a sequence which has been implicated in forming a tight turn structural recognition motif for endocytosis (Collawn et al., 1990) . Tlus region is highly conserved between the varied species of cloned H,K-ATPase 13 subunits (Fig. 10) . While the H,K-ATPase motif is opposite in orientation to the transferrin receptor sequence (i.e., -FRXY-vs. -YXRF-), crystallographic data predicts that tetrapeptide sequences such as -FEKY-and -FSKY-are capable of forming the requisite tight turn structures (Collawn et al., 1990; A1varez et al., 1990) . Furthermore, studies performed on the transferrin receptor demonstrate that this sequence mediates internalization when expressed in either orientation (Girones et al., 1991) . The -FRXY-sequence is not found in 13~ or 132 subunits of the Na,K-ATPase (Martin-Vasallo et al., 1989; , neither of which appear to localize to similar vesicular structures (data not shown). It remains to Figure I0 . Comparison of H,K-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase/3 subunit sequences with the transferrin receptor internalization motif. The amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic domains of the H,K-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase/3 subunits were aligned with the cytoplasmic domain of the human transferrin receptor. The -YXRF-sequence of the transferrin receptor has been shown to form a tight turn conformation that has been implicated in serving as the structural motif for endocytosis (Collawn et al., 1990) . This sequence is shared in the reverse orientation, FRXY across three species of the H,K-ATPase/3 subunit, and is not shared across Na,K-ATPase ~3 species (boxed region). The implications of this observation are discussed within the text.",

It is interesting to consider why the H,K-ATPase might be well served by some manner of endocytosis signal. It its native gastric parietal cell, the H,K-ATPase c~/13 complex resides within a preapical compartment, which in response to physiologic stimuli for gastric acid secretion, rapidly fuses with the apical membrane (Hirst and Forte, 1985) . When the stimulatory signal abates, the H,K-ATPase, along with most of the apical membrane, is rapidly endocytosed and retrieved into this preapical tubulovesicular compartment. Clearly, a mechanism must exist to ensure that these pumps can be rapidly and efficiently removed from the apical membrane. The -FRXY-signal is likely to serve this function. We are in the process of generating site-directed mutants that delete this sequence or alter the critical tyrosine residue in order to test this hypothesis.",

The first demonstration of this property involved the influenza hemagglutinin protein, which is normally targeted to the apical membrane of MDCK cells (Rodriguez-Boulan and Sabatini, 1978) . Brewer and Roth found that this protein could be rerouted to the basolateral surface if a single amino acid in its cytoplasmic domain is altered to create a functional endocytosis signal. These observations have now been extended to a number of proteins. In light of this behavior, it is surprising that the endocytosis competent H,K-ATPase/~ accumulates at the apical surface of LLC-PK~ ceils. We hypothesize that this behavior reflects the fact that LLC-PK, cells, derived from the renal proximal tubule, are specially adapted to perform apical endocytosis.",

Their apical domains are richly endowed with coated pits and endocytic profiles, which participate in the retrieval of small proteins and peptides which have been filtered through the glomerular basement membrane (Maunsbach, 1976) . The preponderance of apical endocytic machinery may also be associated with the apical accumulation of proteins whose targeting is mediated by virtue of their coated pit localization sequences. According to this model, a coated pit localization sequence specifies neither apical nor basolateral sorting, but instead ensures that proteins so endowed accumulate at the most endocytically active domain. This interpretation receives support from the surprising observations of Pathak et al. (1990) , who generated a transgenic mouse expressing the low density lipid (LDL) ~ receptor. This protein has been shown to possess a Coated pit localization sequence as well as an autonomous basolateral targeting signal, both of which can independently mediate basolateral sorting of receptor constructs expressed in MDCK cells (Hunziker et al., 1991) . The distribution of the wild-type LDL receptor in transgenic mice was found to be basolateral in the epithelia of intestine and liver. In the proximal tubule of the kidney, however, this protein was restricted to the apical brush border. It is possible that in this tissue the LDL receptors coated pit localization sequence exerts a dominant effect which results in the protein being sorted to the endocytically active apical surface. To test this theory, we are currently comparing the sorting behavior of a number of endocyticaUy competent proteins exogenously expressed in both MDCK and LLC-PK~ cells. Preliminary results suggest that, consistent with this model, H,K-ATPase/~ accumulates at the basolateral surface of MDCK cells. It would appear, therefore, that sorting signals may specify delivery to functionally rather than topologically defined plasma membrane domains.",
