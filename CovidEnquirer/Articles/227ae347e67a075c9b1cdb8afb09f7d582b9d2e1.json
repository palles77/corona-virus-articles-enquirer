Methods: To test one method of increasing hospital surge capacity, a temporary negative-pressure isolation ward was established at a fully functioning hospital. Negative pressure was achieved in a 30-bed hospital ward by adjusting the ventilation system. Differential pressure was continuously measured at 22 locations, and ventilation airflow was characterized throughout the ward. Results: The pressure on the test ward relative to the main hospital hallway was \u221229 Pa on average, approximately 10 times higher than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for airborne infection control. No occurrences of pressure reversal occurred at the entrances to the ward, even when staff entered the ward. Pressures within the ward changed, with some rooms becoming neutrally or slightly positively pressurized. Conclusions: This study showed that establishing a temporary negative-pressure isolation ward is an effective method to increase surge capacity in a hospital.",

            "text": "Infectious disease epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome starting in 2012, are public health threats that are best mitigated by deliberate planning at the health system level. [1] [2] [3] A robust response to a large-scale infectious disease outbreak is predicated, in part, on coordination between public health and health care delivery systems. 1, 4, 5 Hospital pandemic preparedness plans typically include protocols for handling a surge of infectious patients. 6 Hospitals need to respond rapidly if they are among the first impacted by a highly contagious outbreak. 7 Most U.S. hospitals use negative-pressure airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) to house patients with suspected or confirmed airborne transmissible infections. The pressure difference between an AIIR and the hospital corridor is recommended to be \u22122.5 Pa in the United States. 8, 9 It is also recommended to have an air exchange rate (AER) of 12 air changes per hour (ACH), of which 2 ACHs must be outside air in an AIIR. 2, 8 In approximately one-half of urban hospitals, only 2%-4% of rooms are equipped with negative pressure. 10 The number of patients needing health care services may rapidly exceed such a small AIIR capacity during an airborne transmissible pandemic or bioterror event. 11 There are no regulations stipulating surge capacity requirements for U.S. hospitals. Guidance for intensive care unit capacity has been published, ranging from a 20%-300% increase in bed numbers, depending on the type of incident. 5, 6, [11] [12] [13] [14] One option to meet capacity needs would be to implement a temporary negativepressure isolation ward that could house a large number of patients. To date, there are few studies detailing the effectiveness of temporary isolation wards to be used during a surge. Rosenbaum et al demonstrated during a hospital disaster preparedness drill that multiple high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered negative air machines placed in a physical therapy gymnasium produced the recommended pressure and AER for negative-pressure isolation. 15 In another demonstration, a 3-unit temporary patient shelter was constructed out of plastic sheeting and ventilated using negativeair machines. 16 Containment was estimated using fluorescent tracer particles, and very high levels of containment were achieved (>99%) with AERs of 15 ACHs.",

UV-C fluxes of 20-40 \u03bcW/cm 2 are recommended for disinfecting tuberculosis. 18 Flux levels at lower heights were within recommended levels for human safety. 19 ",

Figure 2A shows that the IWH-MHH and IWH-stairwell 2 were relatively unchanged throughout the negative-pressure demonstration. There was also typically little temporal variability in internal pressures, with the exception of bedroom 2. Bedroom 2 was used as a family and visitor room, and it was not possible to keep the door of this room closed throughout the demonstration. Figure 3 depicts the door opening events compared with the steady-state pressure conditions on the ward for the outer envelope and the ISR-IWH pressure differences. Door opening events made up 5.7% of the outer envelope pressure time series and 2.3% of the ISR-IWH time series. Besides the ISR-IWH pressure difference, other internal pressures did not vary with door opening events that occurred at the outer edge of the ward's pressure envelope. Internal pressures were impacted when bedrooms and bathrooms were entered, but these were rare compared with frequent traffic by hospital staff in and out of the ward. Ward door opening events resulted in pressures typically changing to around 0 to \u22125 Pa. Most ingress and egress events occurred on the fire door hallway side, the side without the anteroom, because this allowed easier access. The ANTstairwell 1 and IWH-stairwell 2 differences tended to only reduce to near-zero values when stairwell doors were opened, otherwise negative-pressure was maintained even when the ward was opened at other locations. The ISR-IWH pressure difference typically became more negative when the ward was depressurized, and only decreased when the AIIR was entered.",

An additional goal in a hospital is infection control; therefore, many systems are 100% outside air and have higher AERs than typical office buildings. When supply air is reduced, there may not be sufficient conditioned air serving the rooms, and the occupants may feel more uncomfortable. This situation would be less in milder climates. This project was conducted in a milder climate, the San Francisco Bay Area, where at the time of the study in March 2015 the mean temperature for the week of the study was 16\u00b0C, with a minimum of 8\u00b0C and a maximum of 24\u00b0C.

Another option would be to control individual room dampers, which for this hospital would have added an additional layer of complexity that was beyond the scope of the demonstration. As a result, some room airflow changes within the ward were not entirely predictable. As expected, an overall reduction in supply flows was observed during the negative-pressure demonstration, but there was significant room-to-room variability. This variability resulted in 2 rooms within the ward (bedroom 1 and UTL) becoming neutrally or positively pressurized during the demonstration. In bedroom 1, the difference between the supply and return flow decreased from 186 to 89 m 3 /h during the pretest and demonstration phases, respectively. Interestingly, room-to-room variability in ventilation flow changes was not limited to supply flow changes, but often return flows increased and exhaust flows decreased when negative pressure was implemented. Despite our findings that airflow reversals were rarely encountered, they are possible, even when pressure gradients far exceed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines (as seen on the ward in bedroom 1 and UTL). Therefore, it is prudent for HCWs and visitors to wear airborne precautions (eg, N95 respirator) while residing on these wards, whether in patient rooms or common areas.",

Early in the course of a high-consequence infectious disease outbreak when large numbers of ill patients require health care services, it may be necessary for hospital engineers to rapidly convert a routinely functioning ward to a negative-pressure isolation ward.

In 6 minutes, 99.9% removal efficiency in the ANT could be achieved, assuming unobstructed air movement. 2 Anteroom use is often recommended for airborne infection control. 20, 24 The optimal anteroom pressure differentials and flow rates for aerosol containment with consideration of HCWs moving through doorways have not been determined. Studies have shown that opening the doors of ISRs can generate flow across the doorway. [25] [26] [27] Inducing a pressure difference, however, across a door can decrease the air volume exchange across the door. 25, 28 For this demonstration, it would have been optimal to construct an ante-room at each hallway entrance to the temporary isolation ward (we only constructed one to minimize project complexity). With 2 hallway anterooms, one would be used as a clean anteroom for ingress and PPE donning, and the other would be a potentially contaminated anteroom for egress and PPE doffing.",

Temporary patient housing options and gymnasiums also do not typically provide amenities found in hospital bedrooms, such as oxygen supply lines, various medical devices and equipment, and a bathroom with a toilet and shower.
