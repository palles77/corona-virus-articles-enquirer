M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction was confirmed at the viral infection level since a point mutation at the V68 residue of M markedly inhibited SARS-CoV pseudovirally induced IFN-\u2424 production. Thus, the results in- dicate for the first time that SARS-CoV M protein may function as a cytosolic PAMP to stimulate IFN-\u2424 production by activating a TLR-related TRAF3-independent signaling cascade",

However, it remains elusive whether or not a pathogen-derived protein can function as a cytosolic pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). In this study, we demonstrate that delivering the membrane gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) into HEK293T, HEK293ET, and immobilized murine bone marrow-derived macrophage (J2-M) cells significantly upregulates beta interferon (IFN-\u2424) production. Both NF-B and TBK1-IRF3 signaling cascades are activated by M gene products. M protein rather than M mRNA is responsible for M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction that is preferentially associated with the activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor proteins MyD88, TIRAP, and TICAM2 but not the RIG-I signaling cascade.",

            "text": "Pathogen-derived proteins such as virus-encoded proteins are frequently documented as negative regulators in subverting type I interferon (IFN-I) induction by interfering with a certain key component(s) of IFN-I activation signaling cascades. Viral evolution may develop a unique strategy to inhibit host innate immunity by generating virus-derived antagonists to some key signaling molecules. The vaccinia virus encodes two Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domains containing proteins A46R and A52R, which can negatively regulate TLR signaling by two distinct mechanisms (13) . The vaccinia virus A46R inhibits TLR signaling by physically interacting with the BB loop of TIR containing adaptor proteins such as MyD88 adaptor-like (MAL) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) to disrupt receptor-adaptor (e.g., TLR4-MAL and TLR4-TRAM) interactions (14, 15) . Differently, the A52R protein may function as a dominant negative MyD88 to directly interact with TRAF6 and IRAK2 (16, 17) . On the other hand, the vaccinia virus N1L protein, another protein homologous to A52R, employs a different anti-IFN-I strategy by targeting both the TBK1/IB kinase (IKK) and IKK\u2423/IKK\u2424 complexes to inhibit IRF3 and NF-B signaling, respectively (18) . Alternatively, virus may invade the cells to target the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor signaling pathways for the prevention of IFN-I induction. For example, the influenza virus nonstructural protein NS1 can sequester either the dsRNA or 5=triphosphate RNA products of viral infection which can be sensed by or directly bound to the RNA helicase sensor RIG-I to inhibit RIG-I-mediated IFN-\u2424 production (8, 19, 20) . The paramyxovirus V protein inhibits IFN-\u2424 induction through the blockage of MDA5, another RIG-I-homologous cytosolic dsRNA sensor (21) . A recent study revealed that the transcriptional factor IRF3 might be alternatively targeted and inhibited by the paramyxovirus V protein to impede IFN-\u2424 gene transcription (22) .",

The overexpression of the SARS-CoV M gene has been shown to upregulate the transcriptional level of IFN-\u2424 (26) . To further confirm the result, using either enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or poly(I:C) as a negative or positive control, respectively, we demonstrated that M gene products specifically promoted IFN-\u2424 production, since cotransfection with M small interfering RNA (siRNA) completely abolished M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction at both protein (Fig. 1A , comparing lanes 3 and 4) and mRNA ( Fig. 1B ) levels. Moreover, after a 48-h transfection, cell supernatants were collected and assayed for the presence of IFN-\u2424 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Figure 1C clearly demonstrated that delivering pCMV-Myc-M into HEK293T cells specifically and significantly promoted the secretion of IFN-\u2424 into cell culture medium. In addition, the promoter sequence of IFN-\u2424 was placed upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter to generate the pGL3-IFN-\u2424-Luc construct. To test the specificity of M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction, other viral envelope-associated genes such as the spike (S) and envelope (E) protein genes as well as the M mutant [M(V68A)] from the GZ50 isolate were also included (27) . The result of a dual-luciferase assay using the Renilla luciferase gene as a transfection control demonstrated that the SARS-CoV M gene rather than the S and E genes markedly increased IFN-\u2424 promoter activity (Fig. 1D) , whereas the valineto-alanine alteration at residue 68 of M protein completely abolished this induction, indicating that the specificity of M gene products played a role in this process. Consistent with these results, Western blotting and ELISA further validated the above observation ( Fig. 1E and F). To detect if the SARS-CoV M gene has a direct effect on NF-B activation, pCMV-Myc-M was cotransfected with pNFB-luc, which contained five copies of NF-B recognition sites, into HEK293T cells. The results of the dualluciferase assay revealed that the SARS-CoV M gene specifically and dramatically upregulated NF-B activity compared with the controls (Fig. 1G) . Moreover, M could mediate IFN-\u2424 induction in both dose-and time-dependent manner ( Fig. 1H and I) . Overall, the data strongly indicated that the SARS-CoV M gene product was sufficient to promote IFN-\u2424 gene expression.",

Individually diminishing either TBK1 or IRF3 mRNA expression by siTBK1 or siIRF3 sig-nificantly reversed M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction ( Fig. 2D and G, respectively), indicating that M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction functions at a level at or above the signaling molecule TBK1.

Upon the ligation of a PRR with its specific PAMP, both RLR and TLR pathways transmit the signal to a common class of adaptors called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) including TRAF2/TRAF5, TRAF3, and TRAF6 (28, 29) . To test the effect of M on RLR and TLR signaling as well as TRAF expression, an increased dose of pCMV-Myc-M constructs was first transiently transfected into HEK293ET cells. The results in Fig. 3A demonstrate that the increased delivery of pCMV-Myc-M into HEK293ET cells markedly enhanced TRAF6 but not TRAF2 and TRAF3 expression, indicating that TRAF6-mediated signaling transduction might contribute to the upregulation of IFN-\u2424 production. To further address how TRAF expression is associated with RLR and/or TLR signaling pathways, the M genetransfected HEK293ET cells were also assayed for the expression of upstream sensors and/or signaling molecules of TRAFs. Figure 3B demonstrates that no significant alteration was observed in the expression of RIG-I, MDA5, and MAVS after exogenously delivering M genes into HEK293ET cells, indicating that the RLR signaling pathway might not be targeted by M gene products. In contrast, three adaptor proteins (MyD88, TRAM/TICAM2, and TIRAP) associated with TLRs were all upregulated (Fig. 3C) , while the adaptor protein TRIF failed to be upregulated in responding to M gene overexpression (Fig. 3D) . Overall, the results indicate that TLR signaling pathways are mainly targeted by the SARS-CoV M gene product for the induction of IFN-\u2424 expression.",

This expression construct can generate only mRNA and no protein due to the translation failure of the mRNA substrates. Western blot analysis shows that the M protein synthesis was completely blocked in the M-stop construct but not the wild-type M construct (Fig. 5B ). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis shows that the M-stop construct did not induce IFN-\u2424 production in HEK293T cells, indicating that M-mediated IFN-\u2424 production is dependent on M protein rather than M mRNA (Fig. 5C) .",

One critical question remaining to be answered is whether the driving force for M protein-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction is generated intracellularly or extracellularly. To answer this question directly, the TRAP\u2425 gene, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated gene, was cotransfected with M into HeLa cells. Brefeldin A (BFA) was employed in the assay system to block M protein transport from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. Indeed, the addition of BFA effectively increased the retention of M proteins in the ER compartment (Fig. 6A) . Figure 6B shows that addition of BFA also effectively inhibited the secretion of IFN-\u2424 into the cell culture medium (right panel) but did not inhibit M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction at either the mRNA level or the protein level (left panel), indicating that the driving force for M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction was indeed derived from intracellular stimulation by M proteins.",

            "text": "Reports indicate that SARS-CoV M protein alone can form virus-like particles (VLPs) that can be secreted extracellularly. Therefore, the secreted M protein might be sensed by its own or other cell PRRs on the cell surface to activate IFN-I responses. To rule out this possibility, OxPAPC (a TLR2 and TLR4 inhibitor) was used to block the function of the accessory proteins CD14, LBP, and MD2 that are required for TLR2 and TLR4 signaling (32) . Figure 6C shows that addition of OxPAPC could effectively inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated IFN-\u2424 production (right panel) but did not reverse the M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction (left panel), indicating that the extracellular stimulation by M pro- SARS-CoV M protein promotes IFN-\u2424 induction independently of TRAF3. It has been well known that TRAF3 plays a critical role in TLR-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction, especially through TLR3 and TLR4 pathways (27, 29, 33) . Since M protein could activate the TLR pathway from inside the cells, it remained unclear whether or not this activation is in a TRAF3-dependent or -independent manner. To address this issue directly, a specific siRNA against TRAF3 was successfully constructed (Fig. 7A) . A dual-luciferase assay was conducted to assay the effect of siTRAF3 on M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction in HEK293T cells. Figure 7B clearly shows that the increased delivery of siTRAF3 did not reverse the M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction, indicating that TRAF3 might not be essential for this activation. To further confirm the above result, Western blot analysis was performed to detect IFN-\u2424 expression in responding to the increased delivery of siTRAF3 into HEK293T cells. The increased delivery of siTRAF3 into HEK293T Co-IP was conducted as shown in the left panel. About 10% input from each lysate preparation was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-HA, anti-Flag, and anti-Myc antibodies as probes. The rest of the lysate was first immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody conjugated with an affinity gel. Then, the reaction products were probed with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. A reverse co-IP experiment was also conducted as shown in the right panel. The lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Then, the reaction products were individually probed with anti-Myc, anti-Flag, and anti-HA antibodies and subsequently subjected to Western blotting. The result is representative of at least 2 identical experiments. IB, immunoblotting; ns, nonspecific. (H) The M gene product does not suppress poly(I:C)-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction. About 2 g/ml of poly(I:C) was cotransfected with 2 g of either M or M(V68A) plasmid along with pGL3-IFN-\u2424luciferase reporter (100 ng) plus pRL-TK (10 ng) into HEK293T cells. After 48 h of transfection, dual-luciferase assays were performed to detect IFN-\u2424 expression (left panel). Each value represents the mean \u03ee standard deviation from three independent tests. The statistical difference was considered to be significant at a P value of \u05450.05. The IFN-\u2424 expression was also subjected to Western blotting (right panel). The relative band intensity was quantitated with the Image J program in comparison with the \u2424-actin control. cells failed to inactivate the activation of IRF3 and NF-B p65 and did not affect the M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction (Fig. 7C) , while a result was obtained consistent with the increased delivery of si-TRAF3 into J2-M cells (Fig. 7D) . In addition, a stable HEK293 cell line with TRAF3 knocked down by siTRAF3 was also established (Fig. 7E) . A dose-dependent increase in IFN-\u2424 production was observed with the increased delivery of M gene into 293 si-TRAF3 stable cells (Fig. 7F) . Thus, the above data strongly indicate that TRAF3 is not required for M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction.",

The cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody conjugated with an affinity gel and then subsequently probed with antihemagglutinin (anti-HA) and anti-Myc antibodies. The left panel of Fig. 7G indicates that M protein was able to disrupt the physical interaction between TBK1 and TRAF3, but M protein itself could not form a complex with TBK1. In the reverse immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment as shown in the right panel of Fig. 7G , M protein was unable to interact with both TBK1 and TRAF3 directly, indicating that M protein may modulate the TBK1-TRAF3 complex formation indirectly. Interestingly, in contrast to the inhibitory effect of M(V68A) on poly(I:C)-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction, the M gene product did not affect the IFN-\u2424 induction stimulated by poly(I:C) (Fig. 7H) , indicating that M has no effect on poly(I:C)induced IFN-\u2424 production while retaining the ability to destabilize the complex formation.",

Earlier results demonstrate that valine-toalanine mutation at residue 68 [abbreviated as M(V68A)] inhibited IFN-\u2424 induction (34) . We employed a SARS-CoV pseudovirus system to mimic the real SARS-CoV infection. Cell lysate supernatants isolated from either M, N, and S cotransfection or M(V68A), N, and S cotransfection were first incubated with 293-ACE2 stable cells (Fig. 8A) for 4 h. Then, the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh medium and further incubated at 37\u00b0C for another 24 h before harvesting. The SARS-CoV pseudovirus VLP(S-M-N) markedly upregulated IFN-\u2424 expression at both RNA and protein levels (Fig. 8B) , whereas the point mutation at the valine 68 residue of M protein completely diminished SARS-CoV pseudovirus-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction, strongly indicating that the M protein residing on SARS-CoV virion could specifically induce IFN-\u2424 production upon infecting the targeted cells. Taken together, our data indicate for the first time that SARS-CoV M protein may function as a novel cytosolic PAMP to activate IFN-\u2424 induction through an intracellular TLR-related signaling pathway in a TRAF3-independent manner.",

Kurt-Jones and colleagues first demonstrated that the innate immune response to the fusion (F) protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is mediated by TLR4 plus its cofactor CD14 on the plasma membrane, indicating that nonbacterial components can serve as extracellular PAMPs (24) . Although some viral structural proteins, such as the nucleocapsid (N) from measles virus (38) and viral ribonucleoprotein from vesicular stomatitis virus (39) , can activate IRF3 and TBK1/IKK\u2426, respectively, it remains to be determined how these viral products can function as PAMPs and where the driving forces for their activation come from. It has been shown that the SARS-CoV M protein alone not only can form virus-like particles (VLPs) in a viral RNA-independent manner (40) but also can induce cell apoptosis by inhibiting some key survival signal pathways, such as the Akt signaling pathway (41) . Thus, the M proteins derived from these infected and apoptotic cells might be eventually secreted and released into the extracellular compartments where the TLRs (such as TLR2 and TLR4) on the cell surface can be potentially recognized and subsequently activated by these extracellular PAMPs for the induction of the IFN-I response. To clarify this possibility, we employed several approaches to test whether the driving force for M proteinmediated IFN-\u2424 production is generated from inside or outside the cells. We used two types of inhibitors, BFA and OxPAPC, to block either the intracellular transport of M protein or the extracellular binding of M protein on TLR2 and TLR4, respectively. Our results reveal that M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction is independent of M protein secretion as well as the extracellular stimulation of TLR2/TLR4 signaling, indicating that the driving force for the M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction is likely generated from inside the cells.",

A possible explanation for these discrepancies might be related to the M gene itself. Early study has shown that M protein possesses a higher substitution rate than other structural proteins in SARS-CoV, and the outcome of these substitutions alters the biochemical and immunological properties of M proteins (43, 44) . One amino acid alteration from valine to alanine at residue 68 is indeed found in the M protein from the GZ50 isolate studied by Siu et al. compared with the isolate used in the current study. Our functional analysis provides strong evidence to demonstrate that the valine-toalanine change at residue 68 of M protein is sufficient to abolish M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction at both the transient-transfection level and the viral infection level (Fig. 1D and E and 8B and C) . Therefore, this amino acid substitution in M proteins indeed affects the interaction between M protein and the PRR for the subsequent IFN-I induction.",

            "text": "It still remains elusive which cytosolic PRR is responsible for M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction. The M protein might be a multifaceted molecule that physically interacts with diverse intracellular sensors and signaling factors (34, 42) . Our data indicate that the TLR-related signaling pathway rather than the RIG-I signaling cascade is responsible for M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction. Interestingly, we observed consistent TRAF3 reductions in both HEK293T and J2-M cells as tested by the transiently intracellular overexpression of the M gene. TRAF3 is one of the key signaling molecules specifically responsible for IFN-I induction (28) . Data from the work of Siu and colleagues have shown that M(V68A) excludes the TRAF3 inclusion in the TRAF3.TANK.TBK1/IKK complex (39) . Although M(V68A)-mediated TRAF3 exclusion inhibits IFN-\u2424 induction, our study showed that M-mediated TRAF3 exclusion is independent of ligand stimulation and the disassociated TRAF3 and TBK1 could not complex with M protein, indicating that M protein might modulate the functions of TBK1 complex indirectly. Interestingly, we demonstrated that M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction was associated with the upregulation of the adaptor proteins MyD88, TIRAP, and TICAM2 but not TRIF, which are all involved in the initiating phase of TLR signaling pathways. TRIF is required for both TLR3-and TLR4mediated IFN-\u2424 induction. In the activation of TLR3, TRIF is directly recruited to the TIR domain of dimerized TLR3, while in the activation of TLR4, TRIF is recruited to dimerized TLR4 indirectly through another TIR-containing adaptor protein, TICAM2 (also called TRAM). If TRIF is not required for M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction, M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction might be activated via a noncanonical TLR4-related signaling cascade independently of TRIF and TRAF3.",

The driving force for M-mediated IFN-\u2424 induction is likely generated from inside the cells rather than the extracellular binding of M proteins with the defined cell surface PRRs, such as TLR4. Plasmid construction. Plasmids pCMV-Myc-M and pBS-U6-siM1 were constructed previously (26) . Plasmids pCMV-Myc-S and pCMV-Myc-E were constructed by inserting S and E into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of pCMV-Myc. The mutant of pCMV-Myc-M(V68A) was generated by using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China).

The transfected cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 200 M NaVO 4 , 1 g/ml leupeptin, 1 g/ml aprotinin, and 1 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). About 15 g of cell lysate for each sample was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. After separation, the reaction products were transferred onto a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Pharmacia, St. Louis, MO, USA). The transferred membrane was first probed with a primary antibody. Then, a secondary antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase was added to the reaction product and was finally visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).Dual-luciferase assay. The dual-luciferase kit was purchased from Promega (Promega Corporation, USA). Cells were transfected with pGL3-IFN-\u2424-luc or pNF-B-luc plus pRL-TK at the ratio of 100:1 or 10:1 as suggested by the manual. The detection was done by following the assay protocol in the kit. The firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were read with a Modulus microplate multimode reader (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay. The transfected cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton, 1 g/ml leupeptin, 1 g/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM PMSF. About 10% of the lysate was subjected to input analysis. Flag affinity gel (Sigma, USA) or anti-Myc and protein G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were added to the rest of the lysate (90%) and rotated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The reaction products were washed 5 times with a wash buffer and then centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 1 min. The IP products were resuspended in the loading buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis.ELISA. Cell culture supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection. The human IFN-\u2424 ELISA kit was purchased from Bluegene (Shanghai, China). The reaction was carried out by following the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction products were detected with Synogen 4 (BioTek, Seattle, WA, USA) under 450 nm.Generation of SARS-CoV pseudovirus and assay of virus-induced IFN-\u2424 production. The generation of SARS-CoV pseudovirus followed the procedure described by Huang et al. (35) . Briefly, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with either the S, M, and N genes or the S, M mutant M(V68A), and N of SARS-CoV. After 48 h of transfection, the culture medium and the transfected cells were collected and subjected to freezing and thawing cycles at least four times. The reaction products were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant containing VLPs was then applied to HEK293-ACE2 stable cells and incubated for 4 h. Then, the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh medium. After 24 h, the infected cells were subjected to total RNA isolation and preparation of whole-cell lysates as described elsewhere. SARS-CoV-mediated IFN-\u2424 expression was monitored by standard Western blotting, RT-PCR, and qRT-PCR.Immunostaining assay. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Myc-M and Flag-TRAP\u2425 (45) . After 24 h of transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min on ice and then incubated in 1\u03eb phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. The cells were first incubated with primary antibody rabbit anti-Flag or mouse anti-Myc for 1 h. Then, the secondary antibody fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse or tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 1 h. Finally, the cells were incubated with 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and sealed with glycerol. The results were observed under an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope.Statistical analysis. All values were calculated as means \u03ee standard deviations (SDs) from three independent experiments. The statistical difference between the assayed group and the standard group was subjected to Student's t test. The calculated difference was considered significant at the P value of \u03fd0.05.",
