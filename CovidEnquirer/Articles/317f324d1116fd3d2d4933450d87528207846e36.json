            "text": "Xylometazoline hydrochloride (HCl) (2-[4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2,6-dimethylbenzyl]-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole HCl) is a well-established nasal decongestant that belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of sympathomimetic drugs and acts selectively on \u03b1-adrenergic receptors (alpha-adrenergic agonist). 1 Xylometazoline HCl is applied topically to relieve nasal congestion associated with acute or chronic rhinitis, common cold, sinusitis, hay fever or other allergies. It causes vasoconstriction in the nasal submucosa, which is manifested as a collapse of the venous sinusoids. Xylometazoline HCl action is characterized by a fast onset with an effect obtained after 5-10 minutes and lasting for 6-8 hours. 2 The efficacy of xylometazoline HCl as a topical nasal decongestant is well proven. 3, 4 Xylometazoline HCl has been used in the EU in the treatment of nasal congestion caused by rhinitis/sinusitis since 1959. Since then a large number of preparations containing xylometazoline HCl have been approved and marketed in several European countries.",

            "text": "Carrageenan is a high-molecular-weight sulfated polymer derived from red seaweed (Rhodophyceae) that has been extensively used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, and is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as reviewed by Cohen and Ito. 5 Three main forms of carrageenans are commercially used: iota-, kappa-and lambda-carrageenan. They differ in the degree of sulfation, solubility and gelling properties. 6 The antiviral mechanism of carrageenan is based on the interference with viral attachment: carrageenan forms a barrier on the mucosal surface, thereby preventing the interaction between virus and cellular surface. As a result, infection of cells is inhibited. The antiviral effectiveness varies with the type of polymer as well as the virus and the host cells, 7-17 as reviewed previously. [18] [19] [20] We already published that iota-carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of major (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 receptor) and minor group (low-density lipoprotein receptor) human rhinovirus (hRV) 21 and influenza virus A replication. 22 Furthermore, we demonstrated the broad antiviral efficacy of an iota-carrageenan containing nasal spray against common cold viruses in several randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trials. [23] [24] [25] The pooled analysis of two studies conducted in 153 children and 203 adults revealed that patients infected with any respiratory virus who were intranasally treated with iota-carrageenan showed a 1.9-day faster recovery from common cold symptoms than placebo-treated patients in the intention-to-treat population. 26 Carrageenan is contained in medical device nasal sprays that have been approved and marketed in the EU for 10 years for the supportive treatment of common cold/flu-like illnesses caused by viruses.",

The intranasal (i.n.) topical application provides reliable and fast relief from the symptoms of nasal congestion and facilitates breathing during common cold/flu-like illnesses and allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, it facilitates drainage of the secretion during sinusitis and can be used as an adjuvant treatment of mucosal swelling due to otitis media. Additionally, iota-carrageenan can reduce the reproduction and spreading of respiratory viruses. The above described indications frequently involve viral infections which worsen the course of the underlying disesase. Therefore, a nasal spray which combines decongestant and antiviral properties is benefitial for patients when compared to conventional xylometazoline HCl products.",

It is emphasized that all animal studies presented in this manuscript were pivotal studies in a nonclinical program for pharmaceutical drug development and were therefore compliant with OECD Principles of GLP and national GLP requirements. For all animal studies, procedures and facilities comply with requirements of commission directive 86/609/ EEC and national legislation defined in animal protection law concerning the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific procedures. All animals were bred for experimental purposes according to Art. 9.2, No. 7 of the German Act on Animal Welfare. The studies were conducted by BSL BIOSERVICE GmbH (Munich, Germany) to comply with OECD principles of GLP and the German Acts on Animal Welfare (Tierschutzgesetz, July 2009). The studies were authorized under the BSL BIOSERVICE licenses to conduct repeated dose toxicity studies granted by the government of Upper Bavaria, Munich, Germany. Approval was received before the start of the studies from the competent authority: Regierung von Oberbayern, Abteilung Veterin\u00e4rwesen (80534 Munich, Germany). Animal housing and handling including sacrifice fulfilled standard requirements for pivotal GLP studies to be used in the nonclinical development of pharmaceuticals. Studies followed ICH M3 guidance and are therefore also in accordance with the 3R (replacement, reduction, refinement) principles for more ethical use of animals in testing.

After a defined exposure period, the CAM is evaluated for development of irritant endpoints (hyperemia, hemorrhage and coagulation). Effects in the CAM blood vessels and albumen are subjectively assessed and scored.

Based on these considerations, we propose that the antiviral activity of carrageenan is based on a two-step-mechanism: first, iota-carrageenan forms a viscous layer at the mucosa, in which virus particles entering the nasal cavity become trapped. Therefore, they cannot infect mucosal cells; primary infection is prevented. Second, newly synthesized virus particles that are excreted from the cells adhere to the carrageenan film as well, resulting in an inhibition of secondary infection. This leads to a significant reduction of viral load in the nasal fluid and hence a reduction of duration of disease. [23] [24] [25] [26] This mechanistic scenario is further supported by permeation experiments as described by Hebar et al 34 in which the permeation behavior of methyl anthranoyl-labeled iota-carrageenan on bovine nasal mucosa was evaluated at pH 7.5 (healthy nasal mucosa) and pH 5.5 (infected nasal mucosa). No permeation was observed at both pH values over a period of 3 hours, indicating that carrageenan was still present on the surface as a film. We then wanted to know how long carrageenan stays in the nasal mucosa before it is removed by the mucociliary clearance system. To this end, we performed an adapted saccharin test, which was first described by Andersen et al 35 in 1974 to evaluate the time to taste clearance in the presence and absence of 0.18% iotacarrageenan. We conducted a cross-over study in which the nasal mucociliary clearance (NMC) time was determined in 5 healthy volunteers (4 females, 1 male; age 32-59 years) in a double blinded setup. To this end, two nasal spray formulations containing glycyrrhizin as a taste marker with and without 0.18% iota-carrageenan were prepared and blinded. 140 \u00b5L of test formulation were applied into each nostril; the time of application, the first detection of taste and the time of absence of taste were noted. From these data, NMC mean values (\u00b1 SD) were calculated for both groups. The mean NMC time was 127 (\u00b1 43) minutes in the carrageenan-free group; when carrageenan was present, NMC was extended ",
