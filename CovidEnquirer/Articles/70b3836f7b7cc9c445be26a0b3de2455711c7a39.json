In order to reveal the effect of copy number variation in the HMGR gene on the MVA pathway, the HMGR gene from Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (GuHMGR) was cloned and over-expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Six recombinant P. pastoris strains containing different copy numbers of the GuHMGR gene were obtained and the content of ergosterol was analyzed by HPLC. The results showed that all the recombinant P. pastoris strains contained more ergosterol than the negative control and the strains with 8 and 44 copies contained significantly more ergosterol than the other strains. However, as the copy number increased, the content of ergosterol showed an increasing-decreasing-increasing pattern. This study provides a rationale for increasing the content of GA through over-expressing the GuHMGR gene in cultivars of G. uralensis.",

As a result, cultivars have now become the main source of this herb. However, the low content of GA in these cultivars has placed severe restrictions on their sustainable development. Attempts have been made to solve this problem using cell suspensions of G. uralensis [8] [9] [10] [11] but without success. We therefore decided to genetically engineer G. uralensis plants through modifying the triterpene biosynthetic pathway which leads to the formation of GA.",

Then when an enzyme level decreases, feedback inhibition may be interrupted leading to reopening of the metabolic pathway which could explain why the level of ergosterol is increased in the P. pastoris strain containing 44 copies of the GuHMGR gene.",
