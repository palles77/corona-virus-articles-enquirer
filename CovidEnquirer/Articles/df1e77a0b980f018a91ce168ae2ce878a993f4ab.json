Foods are considered too fatty, too sugar-and salt-laden; both the air and the water is making people sick. If all that were not enough, North Americans have been made anxious, if not downright paranoid, about everything from possible terrorist attacks to catching Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the avian flu or H1N1. At the same time, the strong baby boom cohort is becoming obsessed with aging, refusing to give in to wrinkles and sagging bodies. So it is not surprising that North Americans are desperate to find an oasis, a place where it is possible to be at peace, breathe deeply, regain one's internal balance, reestablish the harmony between body, mind and soul so that they can confront this fast-paced, complex and increasingly scary world another day. Yet that older cohort is no longer prepared to make big efforts and huge sacrifices to look and feel better, as they did just a decade previously. The time has come to be kind to ourselves: to strive for balance, harmony but also pleasure.",

On the other hand, the concept of 'wellness' emphasises personal responsibility for making lifestyle choices and self-care decisions that will improve our quality of life. People who engage in wellness tourism are generally healthy, but seek therapies to maintain this state of wellbeing.",

Two phenomena have contributed largely to its growth: the aging of the baby boomers, who do not want to grow old or at least age in such a way that their quality of life is not diminished; and the realisation that our healthcare system cares less about our health and more about our illnesses, and therefore if we want to be proactive in keeping ourselves healthier and looking better, we had better take control of our own wellbeing and prevent diseases from developing in the first place.",

The concept of 'wellness' has been recognised as a major force in the United States for over 10 years now, while it is just starting to take a hold in other countries to any meaningful extent. It was in the early part of the 1990s that the domination of destination spas in the mar-ketplace was challenged by the phenomenal growth in resort spas and day spas. No longer were people willing to retreat for relatively long periods -destination spas require a minimum stay of one week -without other family members, and certainly no children, present. The purists who were attracted to destination spas have been joined by a much broader, mainstream type of clientele looking for less-intensive opportunities to treat themselves. This clientele is usually healthy, quite fit, and wants to enjoy a very broad selection of programs during their holidays as well as a rich and varied cuisine. These clients look for 'wellness breaks', the two-to four-day 'quick fix' solutions of which our time-poor society in North America is so fond, and which often complement their use of day spas throughout the year.",

            "text": "While this segmentation of the supply-side is seen as the 'official' typology, Horgan (1995 ( , as cited in Spivack, 1998 suggested that many health resort owners and operators in the US consider the word 'spa' as old-fashioned, and too often associated with simply pampering or beauty treatments, and have therefore tended to incorporate new phrases, such as 'lifestyle resorts', 'longevity centres', 'holistic wellness programs', or 'fitness vacations' to describe or market their product. This points to a fundamental difference in the perception of spas between Europeans, who tend to think of them as linked with medical hydrology and therapeutic treatments, and Americans who link them to health and fitness (at the time, ISPA was still known as the International Spa and Fitness Association). Indeed, quite a few high-end spas in North America do not offer any waterbased treatments, which goes against the very origin of the term spa, which derives from the Latin 'sanitas per aquam' (healing through water). This divergence also translates into the perception of the 'spa experience': for those who consider it to be part of a rigorous medical science, it is the healing properties of the waters, mud, herbs, and even climate that drive the overall experience (e.g., Kaspar, 1974) , whereas for those who see it as part of a social, physical, psychological, or even spiritual engagement, believe it is more a holistic approach to wellness (e.g., Spivack, 1998) . McNeil & Ragins (2004) went so far as to suggest that '[s]pa consumers are looking for a nurturing and healing place where they can enjoy community time, and have shared experiences with friends, relatives and spouses. They want to feel protected and cared for and be able to make personal connections' (p. 32).",

Thus the notion of travel to visit these special places was an integral part for all of these cultures.

According to these authors, this form of tourism was seen to include, among other services, medical examinations by qualified doctors and nurses at the resort or hotel, special diets, acupuncture, transvital injections, vitamin complex intakes, special medical treatments for various diseases such as arthritis, and herbal remedies. Goodrich and Goodrich predicted the growth of this concept with rising incomes, and foresaw that people would devote more time to leisure/recreational activities, and seek longer, healthier lives.",

According to Dunn, unless man is considered as a whole living within a constantly changing total environment, 'high-level wellness' cannot be achieved. More recently, Sweeney and Witmer (1991) presented a holistic model for wellness and prevention -'the Wheel of Wellness' -across the lifespan that comprised 18 characteristics. Building on this concept, the authors (Myers, Sweeney, & Witmer, 2000) define wellness as being 'a way of life oriented toward optimal health and well-being in which the body, mind, and spirit are integrated by the individual to live more fully within the human and natural community' (p. 252).

In addition, the Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC) undertook three studies in the mid-2000s into the supply of spas in Canada (in collaboration with ISPA), the profile of the Canadian spa consumer and the competition for this product. The CTC, in partnership with the provincial ministries of tourism, also spearheaded a Travel Attitudes and Motivation Study in both 1999 and 2006 with exten-Volume 17 2010 sive phone interviews and mail-back surveys (for a detailed comparison of methodologies, see Joppe & Choi, 2010 ) that provided a rich source of information about non destination-specific attitudes, motivations and behaviours of the Canadian population.

Half of these visits were taken to spas in Ontario and four out of five spa visits in Canada were made to day spas (11.3 million). Almost 30% of the Canadian adult population visits day spas while at home (Table 2) . It is clear that the spa segment is not a homogeneous one. In The Hartman Group (2006) study, three types of spagoers were identified, based on the frequency with which they seek out these experiences and their attitude towards them: core spa-goers are knowledgable about treatments and feel that learning about and going to spas is important to their lifestyle; while periphery spa-goers (at the other extreme) enjoy going to spas but otherwise show little interest in them. Between these two segments is a midlevel spa-goer segment that is interested in learning about spas but lacks the commitment and passion of the core spa-goers. If we take a closer look at that 40-50% of spa-goers that will travel for the purpose of spa and wellness tourism, it is probably not surprising that these tend to be more core spa-goers, who are not only experienced, but have already tried a range of products and services and are thus the most critical. The majority considered themselves to be in good or excellent health and of average weight. In spite of this, they worry about their health, including what they eat and how much exercise they get. Two-thirds of them take vitamins; and 61% limit the amount of fat they eat. So, while relaxation is their primary motivation for choosing a spa during their holidays, with pampering and stress reduction as secondary motives, a majority reported healthy meal choices to be important in the selection of accommodations.

But messages must go beyond addressing the core segment in terms of communications, menu designs and available spa treatments: even though they are the most committed, they represent the smallest percentage of the overall spa population, and thus, to convert the mid-level and periphery spa-goers, the messages must also address their lower level of knowledge. It is also important to realise that visits to day spas are an activity largely undertaken by women, but spa travel is not: 42% of the Canadian health spa resort clientele are men (up from 31% in 2003; NFO Plog Research, 2003) . Staying at such a resort is no guarantee, however, that they will actually participate in spa-related activities as only 37% indicated that they did so, based on 2006 Travel Attitudes and Motivation Study.

Indeed, there has been a significant shift between 1999 and 2006 in the income groups that are both staying at health spas and participating in health and wellness spa activities. Whereas in 1999 the majority of health spa-goers earned $60,000 and more, by 2006 the majority earned $80,000 and more. This middle-aged group is, however, increasingly introducing both their parents (mainly mothers) and children (mainly daughters) to the spa experience, contributing to the extraordinary growth in demand for facilities as well as treatments. The explosion in spa products for sale in almost any store that carries personal care and beauty products is both a result of, and a contributor to, the growth in spa visits. This 'personal introduction' is likely also the reason why even first-timers seem to have very high expectations regarding their visit. Men who are introduced to the spa experience, often by their spouses, will usually start with a massage as they tend to be driven by notions of 'work'; that is, improving some aspect of their body, their emotional state or their long-term spiritual and personal dispositions (The Hartman Group, 2004) . Increasingly, however, they are warming up to manicures and facials, largely as part of the broader societal trend that has seen a return of the acceptability of male grooming, along with greater acceptance of the gay culture and the rise of the 'metrosexual' who has many of the characteristics of his gay counterparts, but is heterosexual.",

(The Hartman Group, 2006, p. 3) Indeed, one of the more recent research studies clearly indicates the quality of the treatment and services as well as the hygiene of staff and cleanliness of the spa facilities are the top concerns of spa-goers (Table 3; The Hartman Group, 2006), although less in Canada than the United States. However, certification and/or training of the per-sonnel performing treatments evokes somewhat more concern in Canada, although concerns appear to have diminished over time (NFO Plog Research, 2003) . Premier Spas of Ontario as well as its Quebec counterpart, Relais Sant\u00e9, are the only industry associations in Canada that have recognised the need to provide consumers with a guarantee concerning both the facilities and treatments they will find at a spa, and the professionalism and credentials of the staff. Thus, these two organisations have laid a solid foundation to take advantage of the growth in what can be considered a 'super-trend' and squarely address one of the major consumer concerns: quality assurance and consistency with respect to the facilities, spa products, services and treatments provided. For instance, massage therapy training in Ontario is more extensive than that found elsewhere and this province's therapists are controlled by a government regulated college -both go a long way to reassuring consumers.",

For instance, accredited colleges require 1,200 hours of theoretical and practical courses, yet over 60% of programs available are less than 1,000 hours. Even so, at 1,200 hours the requirements are two-thirds of what the international accrediting body requires (Joppe, 2007) . Yet the demand for professional staff is so acute, that spa managers prefer to hire underqualified people and train them to their standards rather than insisting on appropriate qualifications (Joppe & Choi, 2007b) .

Even though all other forms of information sources have seen more or less steep declines over the years (e.g., the use of travel agents has dropped from 61% to 51% over the seven-year period), the odds are quite high that spa-goers use them (e.g., spa-goers are twice as likely as non spa-goers to use a travel agent as an information source).",

They also frequently attend live art performances (e.g., live theatre, high arts, comedy clubs and festivals) while traveling and exhibit particular interest in fine cruise (e.g., wine, beer & food tastings, inn or resort with gourmet dining). (Lang Research Inc., 2007, p. 1) Indeed, there are a number of activities where the odds range from close to three to four times as likely that they will participate compared to nonspa-goers. These include: ice climbing, dog sledding, hang-gliding, hot air ballooning, bungee jumping, horseback riding, windsurfing, cross-or back-country skiing, playing squash and tennis, working out, attending jazz concerts, recreational dancing, dining in restaurants with an international reputation, shopping/browsing in gourmet food retail stores and for clothing, shoes and jewellery. They are also three times more likely than nonspa-goers to stay in a resort, whether it is located on a lakeside/riverside, in the mountains/ski or the seaside (Joppe & Choi, 2009 ).",

The core spa-goers especially are craving this type of knowledge, and avidly pursue their own understanding. Nutrition is already playing a much greater role as people become more aware of health effects procured by different food items, and use different dietary approaches to combat everything from obesity to medical problems. People's anxiety over genetically modified foods, additives and preservatives will lead them to sustain the growth in organic foods and the popularity of farmers' markets, regional cuisines and traditional foods, all of which are perceived to be more 'natural' and therefore healthier. As predicted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2004, spas are becoming the primary consideration for many travellers. Rather than being an 'amenity' offered at hotels or resorts, spas will be the deciding factor or the primary draw. It is thus not surprising that the CTC started to take a very serious interest in the spa traveller market segment in the mid-2000s and undertook a series of studies in collaboration with industry and government partners, both in Canada and the United States, to determine the supply, demand and competition for this market. Specifically, the CTC realised that health and wellness options could be a creative way of capitalising on emerging consumer interests, revitalise and reposition current products and services, and align tourism and nontraditional partners into productive strategic alliances. Its new product portfolio (Verschuren, 2004 ) was a clear step in that direction. Although Canada looked towards countries that have well-coordinated strategies for this sector (Association Resource Centre Inc., 2006b) for inspiration in developing its own approach, its remains to be seen to what extent it will be able to compete in this market. As Williams (2009) points out, the divergent priorities of healthcare and wellness professionals from those of tourism operators can make realising these opportunities very challenging. ",
