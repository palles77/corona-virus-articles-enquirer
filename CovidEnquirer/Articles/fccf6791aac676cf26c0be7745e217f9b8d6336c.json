Chronic treatment with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol causes tardive dyskinesia (TD), which manifests as involuntary and often irreversible orofacial movements in around 30% of patients. Mice treated with haloperidol develop many of the features of TD, including jaw tremors, tongue protrusions, and vacuous chewing movements (VCMs). In this study, we used genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred inter-cross (RIX) mice to elucidate the genetic basis of antipsychoticinduced adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We performed a battery of behavioral tests in 840 mice from 73 RIX lines (derived from 62 CC strains) treated with haloperidol or placebo in order to monitor the development of ADRs. We used linear mixed models to test for strain and treatment effects. We observed highly significant strain effects for almost all behavioral measurements investigated (p<0.001). Further, we observed strong strain-by-treatment interactions for most phenotypes, particularly for changes in distance traveled, vertical activity, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Estimates of overall heritability ranged from 0.21 (change in body weight) to 0.4 (VCMs and change in distance traveled) while the portion attributable to the interactions of treatment and strain ranged from 0.01 (for change in body weight) to 0.15 (for change in EPS).",

Onset typically occurs in adolescence or early adulthood with the emergence of a number of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior (AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. 2013) . Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia, but as much as 75% of patients discontinue assigned treatments due to side effects and/or inefficacy over relatively short periods of time (LIEBERMAN et al. 2005) . Deciphering the pharmacogenetics of antipsychotics could eventually allow the development of predictive algorithms, such that physicians could predict which patients are prone to develop side effects or less likely to achieve a therapeutic response. Advances in this arena could lead to safer and more efficacious therapeutic interventions for the treatment of schizophrenia.",

            "text": "Haloperidol is a high-potency, typical, first-generation antipsychotic whose use is associated with motoric adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including tardive dyskinesia (SOARES-WEISER AND FERNANDEZ 2007), involuntary orofacial movements, and extrapyramidal symptoms (i.e., dystonia and Parkinsonism) (MILLER et al. 2008) . There is substantial inter-individual variation in liability to these ADRs and direct and indirect evidence suggest a role for genetic variation (LERER et al. 2005; PATSOPOULOS et al. 2005; BAKKER et al. 2006) . There is significant heterogeneity in therapeutic response to antipsychotics (LIEBERMAN et al. 2005) , with roughly equal proportions of patients experiencing remission, partial response, and no benefit. Vacuous chewing movements (VCMs), which present in rodents as purposeless mouth openings in the vertical plane, are a valid rodent model for the human pharmacogenetic phenotype of tardive 4 Traditional recombinant inbred strains that are generated by crossing two parental inbred strains followed by 20 generations of inbreeding by brother-sister mating lack genetic diversity and are limited by the number of available strains (e.g. C57BL6/J, 129S1, BALB/c, etc.). In contrast, the Collaborative Cross (CC) (THREADGILL et al. 2002; CHURCHILL et al. 2004;  COLLABORATIVE CROSS CONSORTIUM 2012) is a panel of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains, derived from eight founder laboratory strains, that was designed as an optimized murine model of heterogeneous human populations (CHURCHILL et al. 2004; AYLOR et al. 2011; THREADGILL et al. 2011; COLLABORATIVE CROSS CONSORTIUM 2012) . The CC captures the complexity of the mammalian genome, and is an important resource for mapping complex traits and system genetics efforts (AYLOR et al. 2011; KELADA et al. 2012; FERRIS et al. 2013; GRALINSKI et al. 2015; GRALINSKI et al. 2017; SHORTER et al. 2017; SRIVASTAVA et al. 2017) . The CC has also been a source of new models of human diseases (ROGALA et al. 2014; GRAHAM et al. 2016; MCMULLAN et al. 2018; ORGEL et al. 2019) . By mating different CC strains, we can generate recombinant inbred inter-crosses (CC-RIX) (ZOU et al. 2005; SCHOENROCK et al. 2018) . CC-RIX are outbred but their genomes are completely reproducible (by mating their parental CC strains) and thus are an intriguing model of the genetic diversity akin to that in human populations (ZOU et al. 2005; LIU et al. 2018) . The genetic diversity of CC-RIX enables the study of parent-oforigin effects and their phenotypic characterization has demonstrated that there are strong strain effects in some measures (CROWLEY et al. 2015; SCHOENROCK et al. 2018) . Using standard inbred lines, we previously demonstrated that we could effectively deliver haloperidol at human-like steady-state concentrations, that steady-state plasma haloperidol concentration is a trait with relatively high heritability, and that there were substantial RI strain differences in the vulnerability to VCMs (CROWLEY et al. 2012a; CROWLEY et al. 2012b; CROWLEY et al. 2014) .",

Overt chewing movements occurred when a larger vertical movement was observed in which the cavity could be seen and the jaw was open for an extended length of time. The videos were scored using The Observer XT (Noldus Inc., Wageningen, Netherlands) observational data analysis program. Previous work by Crowley et al had shown that when 27 inbred strains were treated with chronic haloperidol, the behavioral domains that were measured loaded onto two factors, rather than being discrete constructs (CROWLEY et al. 2012a) . One factor loaded primarily on antipsychotic-induced changes in open field activity, while the other loaded primarily on haloperidol-induced orofacial movements. In this study, we have collapsed all four VCM measures into a single factor.",

For distance traveled (Figure 2a; Figure S2a ) and vertical activity (Figure 2b; Figure S2b) , the leftshift is far more pronounced for the haloperidol treated mice, suggesting a strong average treatment effect. The left-shift is more modest for time in centroid (Figure 2c; Figure S2c ), and not observed at all for stereotypy (Figure 2d; Figure S2d ).

Here, we show that the strain predictions are correlated across phenotypes, as are strain-by-treatment interactions. To assess this correlation, we used the Pearson correlation coefficient and present the results in the correlograms in Figure 5 . The first panel applies to the strain predictions and the second to the strain-by-treatment interactions (note that the blood haloperidol concentration appears only in this second panel; although the relevant random effects were termed \"strain\" effects in the model for this phenotype, they were only predicted in haloperidol-treated mice). For the additive strain effects, there are two salient results. The distance, vertical and body weight phenotypes are correlated, with changes in horizontal distance correlating highly with changes in vertical beams broken. Further, those strains with the largest decreases in the phenotypes exhibited the smallest increases in weight, as expected. The other two open field phenotypes exhibit some correlation with VCM. Increased time spent in centroid is associated with fewer VCM, while increased stereotypy is associated with increased VCM. The correlation manifests in the strainby-treatment effect as well, with the effect of treatment on changes in distance, vertical, and centroid effects all being correlated. Further, the effect of treatment on the changes in distance and time spent in centroid are inversely proportional to the effect of treatment on body weight.",

On average, treatment had a strong effect for every phenotype, with the exceptions of centroid and stereotypy. However, note that even for these phenotypes, there was significant between-strain variability. The majority of the CC-RIX lines exhibited reduced distance traveled and vertical activity upon haloperidol treatment, with about a third of the RIX lines exhibiting little change in these measures after exposure to haloperidol (Figure 3a-b) . Centroid time and stereotypy measures did not appear to be as sensitive to haloperidol induced response ( Figure S3) . The majority of RIX lines showed a delayed response in the inclined screen test (EPS) after haloperidol treatment (Figure 3c ) and more than half of the RIX lines displayed higher incidence of VCMs after haloperidol treatment (Figure 3d) . Interestingly, the prevalence of ADRs in the CC-RIX population is analogous to what has been observed in humans, where 20-43% of patients treated with antipsychotics can develop tardive dyskinesia (HALLIDAY et al. 2002; SOARES-WEISER AND FERNANDEZ 2007) We used linear mixed models to test for the existence of strain and treatment effects. Of note, all phenotype models that included a pre-treatment fixed effect demonstrated significant regression to the mean; subjects with higher pre-treatment scores experienced larger reductions in the phenotype. We observed highly significant strain effects for almost all behavioral measurements investigated (p<0.001). Further, we observed strong strain-by-treatment interactions for most phenotypes, with particularly strong effects (p<0.001) for change in distance traveled and change in vertical activity, as well as change in EPS. When viewing the BLUPs, it is important to keep in mind that given the small sample sizes for each parental strain, comparisons between the effects of individual pairs of parental strains are not necessarily significant, even when the overall effects are highly significant. To draw closer attention to the treatment effect BLUPs, we indicate strains that are at the extreme for those phenotypes with a substantial mean shift in Figure 3 and Figure S3 (in the direction consistent with this mean shift) in the rightmost columns of Table S1. We flag strains that are in the most extreme 10%, finding that 27 strains had extreme responses for at least one of these phenotypes, with eight of these being extreme for multiple phenotypes.",
