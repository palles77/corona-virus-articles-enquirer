It exerts profound activity on vital processes such as immune response, cellular growth, and blood pressure control. Inhibition of either APN gene expression or its enzymatic activity severely affects leukocyte growth and function. We show here that oxidoreductasemediated modulations of the cell surface thiol status affect the enzymatic activity of APN. Additional evidence for the pivotal role of extracellular cysteines in the APN molecule was obtained when substitution of any of these six cysteines caused complete loss of surface expression and enzymatic activity. In contrast, the transmembrane Cys24 appears to have no similar function. Enzymatically inactive cysteine mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as shown by high-resolution imaging and Endoglycosidase H digestion. In the absence of any crystal-structure data, the demonstration that individual extracellular cysteines contribute to APN expression and function appears to be of particular importance. The data are the first to show thiol-dependent modulation of the activity of a typical surfacebound peptidase at the cell surface, probably reflecting a general regulating mechanism. This may relate to various disease processes such as inflammation or malignant transformation.",

While mature B cells and resting T cells lack detectable APN expression, acute and chronic B cell leukemia show an abnormal surface expression of alanyl aminopeptidase, which is associated with a poor prognosis in the case of adult B-ALL (acute B cell leukemia) [22, 23] . A marked increase in the expression of CD13 is found on the surface of T cells activated by mitogens in vitro [24 -26] or derived from local sites of inflammation in vivo [27, 28] . Furthermore, T lymphocytes show an activation-dependent increase in APN gene expression [29, 30] . Antiproliferative effects result from inhibition of both alanyl aminopeptidase activity and expression [30, 31] .

Thiols located on the cell surface are mainly represented by proteinogenic cysteinyl groups. On B-CLL cells, the regulation of this surface thiol status is tightly controlled by membrane-bound oxidoreductases, such as proteindisulfide isomerase (PDI), which catalyze sulfhydryl-disulfide interchange reactions at the cell surface [33] . The inhibition of PDI on viable cells leads to a dramatic rise in total surface thiol expression, which is at least partly due to an increase in cysteine-derived SH groups. Furthermore, \u2425-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is known to be involved in redox modulations of cell surface protein thiols by its participation in the metabolism of glutathione [34] . Similar to PDI inhibition, inhibition of \u2425-glutamyl transpeptidase leads to an increased amount of surface thiols. Therefore, modulations in the surface thiol status of U937 cells are carried out by inhibiting PDI by bacitracin and inhibitory antibodies or by inhibiting GGT by acivicin.",

            "text": "To evaluate the role of each individual cysteine in the APN, site-directed mutagenesis was applied. As deduced from its coding sequence [35] , human alanyl aminopeptidase, a 967-amino acid protein, contains seven cysteine residues at positions 24, 113, 223, 761, 768, 798, and 834, which are all highly conserved between APNs from different species [36] . The first cysteine is located in the transmembrane region of the enzyme, while the latter six cysteines are located in the extracellular part, which also contains the active site with the HEXXH motif (amino acids 388 to 392). In earlier studies, it was shown that correct folding of the extracellular part of APN occurs independently of the residual protein [37] , which suggests that substitution of cysteine 24 will not affect structure and function of alanyl aminopeptidase. In con-trast, the effects of substituting cysteine residues in the extracellular part are not as predictable since alanyl aminopeptidase is known to be expressed as a homodimer of two noncovalently linked subunits [38] . However, it does seem reasonable to suppose that disulfide bridges are involved in the formation of the tertiary structure of alanyl aminopeptidase, especially within its C-terminal domain [39] .",

The C-terminal attachment of GFP to wild-type APN did not change either its subcellular localization or its function: the typical surface expression of wild-type alanyl aminopeptidase was completely retained ( Fig. 2A) . This implies that protein folding, glycosylation pattern, and intracellular transport were not markedly influenced. Results of cytofluorimetric analyses confirmed the intense surface expression of APN-GFP when using either anti-GFP or anti-CD13 antibodies. The mean fluorescence intensities were increased significantly when compared with nontransfected cells (Table 4) . Furthermore, the neutral aminopeptidase activity of the wild-type enzyme was fully preserved. The Ala-pNA hydrolyzing activity of the particulate fraction of EcR-293 cells was significantly increased upon transient transfection with pEGFP-APN in comparison to nontransfected cells that showed only 47.7% of wild-type activity (Fig. 3, black columns) . Further evidence for the structural integrity of the wildtype APN-GFP fusion protein was obtained from SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis of the particulate fraction of EcR-293 cells. Using an anti-GFP antibody, two bands of approximately 170 and 190 kDa were detected. The band with the higher molecular weight corresponds to the 166 kDa monomeric form of mature APN enlarged by 27 kDa of monomeric GFP (Fig. 4, lane 2) . The double band that was detected represents different glycosylation forms, as confirmed by PNGase F treatment, which leads to a single band of approximately 140 kDa. Endoglycosidase H digestion resulted in degradation of the lower molecular weight species, indicating that this was a mannose-rich glycosylation form of APN (Fig. 5) .",

This effect is not due to a loss of APN on the cell surface, since, under the same conditions, the reactivity to the anti-APN mAb clone Leu-M7, which does not affect APN activity, was found to be increased. This could be due to the larger distance of the relevant epitope from the catalytic center, which was concluded from the finding that substitution of cysteine residues 761, 798, and 834 did cause a complete loss of Leu-M7 binding.

            "text": "Furthermore, the function of individual cysteine residues in the APN molecule for establishing correct structure and, consequently, enzymatic activity and surface expression, has not been previously studied. However, APN shares considerable sequence similarity with pyro- glutamyl peptidase II (thyrotropin-releasing hormone degrading ectoenzyme, degrading enzyme, TRH-DE), which also belongs to the M1 family of Zn-dependent metalloproteases (Fig. 7 ) [43] [44] [45] . This is strikingly evident for the four cysteine residues clustered in the Cterminal region. A recent study identified TRH-DE as a disulfide-linked (via Cys68) homodimeric ectopeptidase [46] . However, covalent dimerization does not appear to be essential for its membrane expression or its enzymatic activity. Similar results were obtained in previous biochemical studies on the dimeric assembly and surface expression of APN [47] ; dimerization does not seem to involve covalent bonds [38] . APN is synthesized in the RER, where it is cotranslationally inserted into the membrane and glycosylated [48, 49] . It has long been assumed that high mannose content, as distinct from complex glycosylation, is required for surface expression [50, 51] , while dimerization is not believed to be required [47] . Both surface expression and enzymatic activity require correct folding of the extracellular domain of APN [50, 52, 53] . Furthermore, it was suggested that intramolecular disulfide bridges are involved in defining the tertiary structure of APN [39] and the data presented here strongly support this concept. The specific enzymatic activities of all mutants with substituted extracellular cysteine residues appeared to be significantly reduced or abolished in comparison to wild-type APN. This is in full agreement with data derived from studies concerning the cysteine substitution in TRH-DE [46] . In contrast, substituting glycine for Cys24 did not change APN enzymatic activity, indicating that, as expected, this transmembrane cysteine is not required for the formation of the correct structure of the extracellular domain of APN. As with TRH-DE, surface expression of all other cysteine mutants of APN was found to be diminished. Colocalization studies revealed intracellular retention of these mutants in the ER as shown by characteristic ERstaining patterns and a clear overlap of GFP fluorescence with an ER marker. Furthermore, treatment with Endoglycosidase H, which cleaves off the high-mannose glycans characteristic of proteins that did not reach the Golgi apparatus, confirmed this ER retardation. Taken together, these data indicate that individual cysteine residues in the extracellular part of alanyl aminopeptidase are important for tertiary structure and function of APN. However, all mutants lacking one extracellular cysteine residue could not reach the cell surface. Therefore, it was not possible to directly prove that all of these residues are critical for the surface activity once the protein has reached the cell surface. Whether the dimeric assembly of APN is also impaired by the substitution of cysteine residues remains a challenging task for future studies.",

It is tempting to speculate that this represents a general mechanism that could apply to other surface-bound enzymes. In support of this view, studies on thiol-disulfide interchange-mediated modulations of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, CD143) on activated monocytes revealed similar results. After inhibition of PDI, the ACE enzymatic activity was diminished, whereas no quantitative changes in the surface expression of ACE molecules were observed (data not shown).",

Thus, thiol-dependent regulation of membranebound peptidases could be a contributing cofactor in the initiation and progression of disease. APN and other surface peptidases (e.g., dipeptidyl peptidase IV, CD26) reportedly function as regulators of leukocyte growth and function [32, 54] , and, therefore, inhibitors of their enzymatic activities are potent immunosuppressive, antiinflammatory, and anti-proliferative compounds [15, 55, 56] . The novel concept of a thiol-dependent regulation of surface activities introduces a new regulatory mechanism, which may contribute to the modulation of both the normal and pathological immune responses, and, consequently, to development or manifestation of autoimmune disease, allograft rejection, or malignant growth.
