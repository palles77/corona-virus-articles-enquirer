The RNA genome of some members of the group has been demonstrated to be large, singlestranded, unsegmented, polyadenylated, and infectious (1) (2) (3) (4) . Virus multiplication is thought to occur in the cytoplasm without a requirement for the cell nucleus . Most studies of coronavirus-infected cells using coronavirus-specific immunofluorescence have shown viral-specific antigens only in the cytoplasm (5, 6) . Four hours postinfection (hpi) is the earliest that cytoplasmic viral-specific antigens have been observed (5) . Pensaert (7) has suggested that immunofluorescence begins in the perinuclear region. The results obtained by immunofluorescence are consistent with the results obtained by electron microscopy which show that coronaviruses assemble in the cytoplasmic factories associated with cisternal membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (5, 6) . Robb and Bond (8) , however, reported an intranuclear viral-specific antigen(s) 2 hpi in 17CL-1 cells infected with coronaviruses MHV-JHM (JHMV) or MHV-A59 (A59V) .",

Because JHMV and A59V normally do not grow to high titers, it was desirable to enucleate cells as efficiently as possible. Depending on the cell system, cultures have been obtained with 95-98% enucleated cells by the method of Prescott et al . (11) . Detjen et al . (12) have utilized precentrifugation at 11,000 p at 37\u00b0 before the addition of cytochalasin B to achieve >99% enucleation . In what may be an analogous modification, we allowed exponentially growing 17CL-1 cells to attach for short periods of time (45-90 min) to glass cover-slips after trypsinization. Optimal enucleation was achieved by allowing the cells to attach for only 45 min prior to being placed inverted in polyallomer tubes and exposed to high gravitational fields . In the presence of cytochalasin B, 10 tg/ml, 17CL-1 cells were enucleated by this method with >95% recovery with less than 0.1% contaminating nucleated cells as determined by phase microscopic examination of coverslip cultures and by examination of fixed, Giemsaor bisbenzamid H 33258-stained cultures . Panel A in Fig . 1 shows a representative low-power field of enucleate cells . A control coverslip of nucleated cells is shown for comparison in panel B . These methods of examination gave equivalent results. In some experiments a few nucleated cells were desirable for purposes of comparison . In this case the cells were allowed to attach to the coverslip for 90 min and were then enucleated . Enucleated 17CL-1 cells support JHMV and A59V multiplication (Table 1) . Mengovirus, a member of the picornavirus group, served as a positive control (13) . The yield from the following types of infected coverslip cultures was compared : enucleated 17CL-1 cells, nucleated 17CL-1 cells exposed to cytochalasin B and a moderately increased gravitational field, and untreated cells . To preclude the detection of input virus, following virus adsorption for 30 min the cultures were incubated for 60 min with neutralizing antisera to A59V, JHMV, and mengovirus, respectively . The coverslips were then washed free of antiserum, one set of coverslips was frozen and stored at -40\u00b0 and later processed and titrated in the same manner as the other coverslip cul-FIG . 2 . Viral-specific antigen production in enucleated 17CL-1 cells . Enucleated 17CL-1 cells were prepared as described in Fig . 1 with the exception that cells were allowed to attach to the coverslips for 90 min prior to enucleation in order to provide some nucleated cells as positive controls for antigen production . Enucleated 17CL-1 cultures were infected at a multiplicity of 5 with A59V and JHMV, fixed 8 hpi, and stained as previously described (8) . Panel (a) shows both enucleated and nucleated cells with and without JHM viral-specific antigen production . Panel (b) shows a typical field of JHMV-infected enucleated cells. Panels (c) and (d) show representative fields of A59V-infected enucleated cells .",

The titer of A59V and JHMV increased from undetectable levels at 1 .5 hpi (following neutralization of input virus) to 1 .3 x 10' and 4 .1 x 102 IU/ml, respectively. Enucleation reduces the yield of A59V by 2 .1 log, JHMV by 0.84 log, and mengovirus by 1 .15 log when compared to cultures treated with cytochalasin B but not enucleated . Using the percentage of nucleated cells in enucleated coverslip cultures and the amount of virus produced in control cultures, the percentage of the reported yields for enucleated cell cultures that could be produced by contaminating nucleated cells can be calculated . The percentage of nucleated cells is assumed to be SHORT COMMUNICATIONS 227 0.1%, the upper limit of the range we have observed in this experiment . The upper limit at which contaminating nucleated cells produce virus is that of the nucleated counterparts which experience only moderately increased gravitational fields . By using these two upper limits, only 22% (210 IU) of the reported yield of A59V multiplication in enucleated cells could be contributed by contaminating nucleated cells . Similarly, less than 1% of the yield of JHMV (3 IU) and 1.5% of the yield of mengovirus (5 x 10' IU) could have been contributed by nucleated cells. It is unlikely that contaminating nucleated cells are as productive as control cells, due to the additional trauma they have endured .",

Enucleated 17CL-1 cells were prepared by a modification of the method of Prescott et at . 17CL-1 cells (16) were grown and maintained as previously described (17) . Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in DEB 10 (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum) and incubated for 45 min to attach to 1 .2-mm thick, 2 .2-cm-diameter glass coverslips cut from microscopic slides . Coverslips were placed inverted into Spinco SW27 polyallomer tubes with 8 ml DEB 0 (serum-free medium) containing 10 \u00b5g/ml of cytochalasin B and 1% DMSO . Cells were enucleated by centrifugation for 60 min at 8250 rpm at 37\u00b0 in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. Seven milliliters of water was added to each tube holder to help maintain tube integrity and thermal equilibrium . The 5S-34 rotor was prewarmed in a Sorvall RC2 centrifuge by operation at 15,000 rpm for 1 hr . Enucleated cells were incubated for 1 hr in 35-mm dishes with 2 ml DEB 10 and then fixed with methanol, acetic acid (3 :1) and stained with the fluorescent nuclear stain bisbenzamid H 33258 (American Hoechst Corp .). Comparison of cell counts before and after enucleation demonstrated >90% recovery of cells, Panel A is a low-power (100x) field of enucleated cells . Panel B is a control coverslip of nucleated cells . antigens in JHMV-and A59V-infected and enucleated 17CL-1 cells . These infected cells undergo cell fusion and develop typical coronavirus CPE as well as synthesize virus-specific antigens .",
