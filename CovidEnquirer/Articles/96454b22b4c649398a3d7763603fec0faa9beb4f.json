            "text": "Gene 3b (ORF 3b) in porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) encodes a putative nonstructural polypeptide of 27.7 kDa with unknown function that during translation in vitro is capable of becoming a glycosylated integral membrane protein of 31 kDa. In the virulent Miller strain of TGEV, ORF 3b is 5\u0408-terminal on mRNA 3-1 and is presumably translated following 5\u0408 cap-dependent ribosomal entry. For three other strains of TGEV, the virulent British FS772/70 and Taiwanese TFI and avirulent Purdue-116, mRNA species 3-1 is not made and ORF 3b is present as a non-overlapping second ORF on mRNA 3. ORF 3b begins at base 432 on mRNA 3 in Purdue strain. In vitro expression of ORF 3b from Purdue mRNA 3-like transcripts did not fully conform to a predicted leaky scanning pattern, suggesting ribosomes might also be entering internally. With mRNA 3-like transcripts modified to carry large ORFs upstream of ORF 3a, it was demonstrated that ribosomes can reach ORF 3b by entering at a distant downstream site in a manner resembling ribosomal shunting. Deletion analysis failed to identify a postulated internal ribosomal entry structure (IRES) within ORF 3a. The results indicate that an internal entry mechanism, possibly in conjunction with leaky scanning, is used for the expression of ORF 3b from TGEV mRNA 3. One possible consequence of this feature is that ORF 3b might also be expressed from mRNAs 1 and 2.",

            "text": "Expression of coronavirus genes occurs through the synthesis of a 3\u0408 coterminal nested set of mRNAs. Although coronavirus mRNAs are structurally polycistronic (the 3\u0408-most mRNA in many but not all viral species is monocistronic), evidence from studies of translation both in vitro and in vivo has suggested that most function as monocistronic messages. That is, despite their polycistronic configuration, usually only the 5\u0408-terminal ORF on each is abundantly translated (reviewed in Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, and Luytjes, 1995) . The location of some coronavirus genes, however, is not 5\u0408-terminal on any mRNA, which would require that the gene, if expressed, be translated by a mechanism allowing translation reinitiation, leaky scanning, frameshifting, or a downstream entry of ribosomes. Examples of such genes include (1) ORF 1b on mRNA 1, from which a polyprotein is synthesized following \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting (Brierly et al., 1987; Eleouet et al., 1995) ; (2) ORFs 3b and 3c on avian infectious bronchitis virus mRNA 3 (Boursnell et al., 1985) , from which 7.4-and 12.4-kDa proteins are synthesized following leaky scanning and internal ribosomal entry, respectively (Liu et al., 1991; Liu and Inglis, 1992; Le et al., 1995) ; (3) ORF 5b on mouse hepatitis virus mRNA 5 (Skinner et al., 1985) , from which a 9.6-kDa protein(the E protein) is synthesized (Budzilowicz and Weiss, 1987; Leibowitz et al., 1988) , by an apparent internal ribosomal entry mechanism (Thiel and Siddell, 1994) ; and (4) the I ORF in mRNA 7 of the bovine and mouse hepatitis coronaviruses, from which the I protein is made in the \u03e91 reading frame relative to N (Senanayake et al., 1992; Fischer et al., 1997) following ribosomal scanning (Senanayake and Brian, 1997) .",

Gene 3b in TGEV is unusual in that for one strain of virus, the virulent Miller strain (Wesley et al., 1989) , it is expressed as the 5\u0408terminal ORF on mRNA 3-1, whereas in three other strains, the virulent British FS772/70 and Taiwanese TFI strains and the avirulent Purdue-116 strain, it is expressed as the second ORF on mRNA 3 (Britton et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1995;  this study) (note mRNA structures in Fig. 1A ). The differences in transcription patterns appear to be a function of the canonical TGEV UCUAAAC intergenic sequence positioned 18 nt upstream of gene 3b in the genome, which in the Miller virus totally conforms to the canonical sequence but in the British FS772/70 and Purdue-116 strains is UCUAAAU and in the Taiwanese TFI strain is ACAAAAC. The nonconforming intergenic sequences apparently fail to promote synthe- sis of a subgenomic mRNA. Translation from ORF 3b when it occurs as the second ORF on mRNA 3 must, therefore, require either a reinitiation of translation after translation of the upstream ORF, a leaky scanning by ribosomes over a long distance (431 nt; Fig. 1B ), or a downstream entry of ribosomes.",

Similar conclusions were reached after revelations of a truncated gene 3b in strains of the closely related porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (Vaughn et al., 1995) . It might therefore be assumed that gene 3b is not translated when it occurs as a downstream ORF as in mRNA 3. However, a product from gene 3b is made in cells infected with the Purdue-116 strain of virus (O'Connor and Brian, 1999) , indicating a mechanism must exist for its synthesis from mRNA 3. Here we report that, whereas mRNA 3 has a sequence predicting leaky scanning for the translation of ORF 3b by the model of Kozak (1989) , experimental results with mutant constructs suggested downstream entry of ribosomes might also be used. Furthermore, deletion analysis indicated that the internal entry of ribosomes did not depend on an immediate upstream internal ribosomal entry structure (IRES) and suggested ribosomes are entering very close to the ORF 3b start site by a mechanism resembling shunting.",

To test this conclusion, separate Northern analyses were done with probes specific for the 90-nt leader and for genes 3a and 3b. Our rationale was that mRNA species 3 and 3-1 would be distinguishable with probes binding within ORFs 3a and 3b because transcripts of 3875 and 3561 nt (or even 4075 and 3761 nt if they included poly A tails of 200 nt in length) are resolvable on a gel of 1% agarose. Northern analyses with the separate probes revealed bands with identical mobilities, indicating the presence of mRNA 3, but not mRNA 3-1, in RNA from Purdue-116 virus-infected cells ( Fig. 2A, lanes 4-9) .",

In both, products from genes 3a (the 7.7-kDa protein containing one methionine) and 3b (the 27.7-kDa form of the protein containing eight methionines and the 20-kDa form presumably containing seven methionines), but not gene 4 (the 9.2-kDa E protein containing four methionines), were obtained (results for wheat germ extract are shown in Fig. 3A , lane 5; note the marker positions in lanes 2-4 and the absence of endogenous product in lane 1). Because a nearly 27-kDa protein was also synthesized from an endogenous transcript in (some) rabbit reticulocyte lysates and the presence of abundant globin protein in the lysate interfered with the resolution of small proteins (data not shown), all subsequent studies described were carried out in wheat germ extract. Thus, from uncapped transcripts bearing similarity to mRNA 3 the first methionine codon in gene 3b (for synthesis of the 27.7-kDa protein) and also the second (assuming synthesis of the 20-kDa protein initiates at the second methionine codon [O'Connor and Brian, 1999] ) are accessed for translation. On a molar basis, the amount of 27.7-kDa gene 3b product is approximately one-fifth of that from gene 3a (Fig. 3B ). There was no evidence of a 9.2-kDa E protein from ORF 4 in this (Fig. 3A , lane 5) or in subsequent experiments, indicating ribosomal accessibility of ORF 3b was probably not the result of template fragmentation.",

However, an approach by leaky scanning according to the model of Kozak (1989 Kozak ( , 1991a ,b) might be expected, since the initiator codon for ORF 3a (UGUA123UGG, in the Quantitation of products from the indicated constructs as determined from AMBIS radioanalytic imager scans of the gel shown in (A).

To test for ribosomal scanning on mRNA 3-like transcripts, three approaches were taken. In the first, the effect of a 5\u0408 cap on the synthesis of 3a and 3b gene products was measured. Increased synthesis from both would be expected if 5\u0408 cap-dependent entry followed by leaky scanning were used (Kozak, 1989 (Kozak, , 1991a . Increased synthesis from 3b might also be expected if a cap-dependent shunting mechanism were used (Jackson, 1996; Mathews, 1996) . As can be observed in Fig. 3A , lanes 6 and 8, and Figs. 3B and 3C, enhanced translation of both ORFs 3a and 3b resulted when capped transcripts of pORF3a-3b-4 and pLORF3a-3b-4 were translated.

With leaky scanning, a diminished synthesis from 3b relative to 3a would be expected regardless of the capped status of the transcripts (Kozak, 1991b) , whereas with shunting a change in the relative amounts would not necessarily be expected.

Within TGEV gene 3a, secondary structures can be predicted (Figs. 6A and 6B) that share features with the putative IRES element in IBV mRNA 3 (Liu and Inglis, 1992; Le et al., 1995) , leading us to postulate that gene 3a might contain an IRES. The predicted structures are five stemloops (I-V), four of which can be drawn as components of pseudoknots. The free energies of these are calculated to be, respectively, \u03ea6.8, \u03e96.0, \u03ea3.8, \u03ea0.8, and \u03e95. are relatively unstable and suggest a low probability for their existence in viral RNA. Nevertheless, to test whether gene 3a might function as an IRES for translation of ORF 3b, deletions within it were prepared and tested. These were (mostly) bidirectional for distances of 16, 86, 74, 192, 314, 337, 334, and 523 nt, and represented 3\u0408-ward deletions of 11, 41, 44, 120, 140, 149, 289 , and 534 nt from the first nucleotide in gene 3a, respectively, for which the mutants were named. Results shown in Fig. 6C and summarized in Fig. 6D indicate that the relative molar amounts of sCAT and the 27.7-kDa gene 3b products (\u03f31:0.12) remained essentially unchanged between wild-type and \u232c149. The only exception was for \u232c41, for which the molar ratio was 1:0.56 along with an inexplicable enhancement of an uncharacterized band with an approximate molecular weight of 6 kDa. For \u232c289, which leaves only 17 nt upstream of the ORF 3b start codon, the relative amounts were surprisingly 1:0.07 and not 1:0, as expected. For \u232c534, there was abundant synthesis of the sCAT protein but no synthesis of the 27.7-kDa protein; however, there was synthesis of the 20-kDa gene 3b product (O'Connor and Brian, 1999) (Fig. 6D) . These results are not consistent with a mechanism of ribosomal entry within gene 3a but rather with one in which ribosomes enter within 50 nt from the start codon of gene 3b. Because the 20-kDa gene 3b product is found with mutant \u232c534, the intriguing possibility exists that ribosomes are entering at or downstream of the gene 3b start site and are scanning in the upstream direction to reach the start codon.",

The relative contribution of each mechanism on mRNA 3 could not be established by the experiments performed here. However, an internal entry of ribosomes was demonstrated by the use of constructs, in which four extensive ORFs within an 884-nt sequence were placed upstream of ORF 3a and synthesis from ORF 3b was shown to remain approximately one-eighth to one-fifth of that from the 5\u0408-terminal ORF. The internal entry showed some properties of shunting in that (1) no IRES element of the type directing internal entry in picornaviruses and togaviruses could be demonstrated within sequence upstream of gene 3b and (2) translation of ORF 3b in capped transcripts from the synthetic multicistronic psCATORF3a-3b-4 showed some inhibition by a competing soluble cap in the translation mix. That is, internal entry in the multicistronic transcript may follow a cap-dependent step as described for shunting in the adenoviruses, pararetroviruses, and paramyxoviruses.",

            "text": "In general, the mechanistic features of ribosomal shunting, so far described for only viral mRNAs (Jackson, 1996; Mathews, 1996) , remain to be clarified. In the case of adenovirus and pararetrovirus mRNAs, an upstream donor structure appears necessary for the shunting step. In pararetrovirus, this appears to be a stable hairpin preceded by a short open reading frame (Hemmings-Mieszczak and Hohn, 1999) . In the case of TGEV ORF 3b shunting reported here, a requirement for an upstream structure seems unlikely, since shunting took place in the presence of foreign sequence (psCATORF3a-3b-4) as well as (relatively) native sequence (pORF3a-3b-4) at the 5\u0408 terminus. In this respect, the TGEV ORF 3b shunting pathway bears similarity to that in paramyxovirus mRNA, for which no apparent requirement for a donor structure was found (Latorre et al., 1998) . Likewise, it is not clear what determines the landing site in a ribosomal shunt. Certainly in the experiments reported here it is not apparent how ribosomes might have been directed to land so close to the 3b initiation codon in TGEV mRNA 3. It is clearly not the postulated secondary structures within gene 3a, because internal entry took place after these had been removed or disrupted (\u232c149, Figs. 6C and 6D ). One possibility is that ribosomes are directed to land at or near the start site of gene 3b by specific sequences or by higher-order structures situated very near the landing site. Precedents for this are found in Sendai virus, wherein sequences both upstream and downstream of the Y1 ORF are required for shunt landing (Latorre et al., 1998) , and in Hepatitis C virus, wherein sequences extending 28 nt into the ORF are required for IRES-directed landing (Reynolds et al., 1995) . Curiously, such a landing site might require that ribosomes backscan to find the gene 3b start codon, a process postulated to explain the translation of certain SV40 and influenza virus transcripts (Peabody et al., 1986; Williams and Lamb, 1989) .",

First, pSP6ORF3a, from which gene 3a and 591 nt of gene 3b can be transcribed with RNA polymerase SP6, was created by ligating the 1111 bp NsiI-PstI fragment from clone pFT39 (a clone containing nucleotides 3968 to 5449 from the genome 3\u0408 end [ Fig. 1A ; Tung et al., 1992] , prepared as described in Kapke et al., 1988a,b) into the PstI site of pGEM-3Z. Second, pSP6ORF3a-3b-4 was created by ligating the 925-bp BsrGI-EcoRI fragment from pORF3b-4 into the 4048-nt vector-containing EcoRI-BsrGI-linearized fragment of pSP6ORF3a. Third, the entire 1340-nt SphI-HinfI insert from pSP6ORF3a-3b-4, after blunt-ending with T4 DNA polymerase, was ligated in the reverse orientation into similarly blunt-ended EcoRI-SacI-linearized pGEM-3Z.",
