            "text": "Objecti6e: To study the correlation between the yield of virus-induced interferon (IFN) production in leukocyte cultures and the risk of recurrent respiratory infections. Methods: A sample of 71 consecutive children enrolled in the Finnish Otitis Media Cohort Study were selected. Children suffering from frequently recurring respiratory infections (FRRIs) were defined as the highest quintile of the entire cohort of 329 children, as regards the number of upper respiratory infections (URIs) and/or episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) during the follow-up period from 2 to 24 months. Results: In the sample of 71 children, there were 18 children with FRRI ( ] 9 URI and/or ] 4 AOM). Leukocyte cultures, prepared from blood drawn from these 18 children at 6 months of age, produced lower yields of IFN than those of the remaining 53 children, when stimulated with adenovirus (P B 0.001), coronavirus (P B0.001) or rhinovirus (P= 0.002). The difference in IFN yields was even greater (P B0.001 with all three viruses) if the comparison was made between children with FRRI and those with no or maximally one URI during the follow-up period. When the IFN production capacity induced by rhinovirus was measured at the age of 24 months, a statistically significant difference between the children with FRRI and the others was also seen (P =0.002). Influenza A virus-induced IFN production capacity did not differ between the groups at either age (P = 0.209). Conclusions: Lowered IFN responses in children suffering from recurrent URIs and/or AOM may, in a subgroup of the children, be due to a genetic property of the child. However, because of the great interindividual variations, we cannot use the IFN production capacity as such for prediction of forthcoming respiratory infections and/or otitis media.",

Certain socio-environmental factors, like attendance at day-care centers, are known risk factors for recurring respiratory infections and otitis media, but no unifying biological cause has been discovered for the situation except in very rare cases of primary immunodeficiency (Lyall et al., 1991) .",

Type I IFNs are synthesized in most nucleated cells as a response to virus infection and comprise several subtypes of IFN-a, a closely related IFN-v and the more distantly related IFN-b. Production of IFN-g (type II IFN) is limited to cells of bone marrow origin. It is produced by activated T-lymphocytes and NK cells, but, according to recent reports, also by cells of the myeloid line. Previous studies have shown that induction of IFN-a expression is under genetic control in mice (Muller et al., 1994) , whereas regulation of IFN-a production in humans has not been studied extensively. Leukocyte cultures derived from different donors are known to vary remarkably with respect to the yields of IFN induced by standard amounts of viruses (Katschinski et al., 1994) . Reduced yields of virusinduced IFN by leukocyte cultures were previously associated with recurrent respiratory infections in children (Isaacs et al., 1981; Bondestam et al., 1984; Vanecek and Lehovcova, 1985; Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 1993 Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., , 1996 . However, in these case-control studies the baseline IFN-responsiveness of the leukocytes of these children was not available and the question remained uncertain whether the decreased IFN response reflected an underlying predisposition or was secondary to the recurrent respiratory infections.",

Mononuclear leukocytes were stored frozen at \u221270\u00b0C in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing 20% DMSO until assayed for IFN responsiveness. To study virus-induced IFN production, leukocytes were thawed rapidly, sedimented to remove DMSO containing medium and resuspended in growth medium at 2\u00d7 10 6 cells/ml. Leukocyte cultures were then inoculated with standard amounts of adenovirus type 7a, human coronavirus 229E, human rhinovirus (a clinical isolate provided by T. Ziegler), and influenza A Beijing/353/89/H3N2 (a gift from R. Pyh\u00e4l\u00e4) as reported earlier (Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 1993) . A single preparation of each virus was used throughout the study stored at \u2212 70\u00b0C as small aliquots. Culture medium for IFN assay was harvested on day 2 and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatants were stored at \u2212 70\u00b0C until assayed. For logistic reasons, we could not use freshly isolated leukocytes in the induction assays. The feasibility of using frozen cells was tested in advance with cells from several volunteers. The absolute yields of IFN were usually two-fold lower from frozen-thawed cell preparations than those in the corresponding fresh cultures, but the donorspecific pattern of IFN yields induced by different viruses was retained (data not shown). IFN concentration was measured by a micromethod based on the reduction of cytopathic effect caused by a standard amount of vesicular stomatitis virus in monolayers of a continuous bovine cell line (NBL), which is not sensitive to human IFN-g. Hence, we assume that most of the measured IFN activity was IFN-a. A standardized leukocyte IFN preparation (a gift from K.

The studies did not determine whether this deficiency reflected a genetic trend to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections or was a secondary consequence of the frequent illnesses. The present study was designed to investigate the correlation in a prospective set-up. As a group, leukocytes from the 18 children with frequent illnesses ( ] 9 URI and/or ] 4 AOM) produced decreased IFN amounts when compared to the IFN production by leukocytes from 53 children with less frequent illnesses ( 5 8 URI and/or 53 AOM). A similar pattern existed at 6 months and 2 years of age with respect to IFN responsiveness to rhinovirus. The findings suggest that the impaired IFN production in some FRRI children might indeed be a genetic property. We also made a comparison of IFN yields between the children with FRRI and those with no or maximally one URI during the followup period. The differences in IFN responsiveness were even greater than in the primary comparison, a finding which further supports the view that the inherent intensity of the virus-induced IFN response might play a role in the susceptibility to URI and/or AOM. Of note, there are many examples of genetically determined aberrations in the production of other cytokines that result in increased severity of other infections (McGuire et al., 1994; Stuber et al., 1996; Westendorp et al., 1997) , including such a common disease as periodontitis (Kornman et al., 1997) .",
