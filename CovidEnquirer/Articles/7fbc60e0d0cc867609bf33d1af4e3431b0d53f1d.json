Studies on young adult cotton rats inoculated with the virus demonstrate inflammation within and surrounding the bronchi and bronchioles with significant leukocytosis. The HMPV was found mostly on the apical surface of the columnar cells. In the same animal model, upregulation of mRNAs related to interferon gamma (IFN)-\u03b1, CCL5, CCL2, CCL3 and interleukin (IL)-2 was demonstrated. Previous infection conferred partial protection in these rats, with lower viral loads within the respiratory tract and a neutralizing antibody response on subsequent infection. 23 However, long-term immunity seems unlikely given the incidence of disease in older adults.",

[39] [40] [41] There are also increasing data linking wheezing secondary to HRV in early infancy with a higher risk of subsequent development of asthma compared with wheezing caused by other viruses. The Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study showed that HRV-related wheezing in the first year of life led to a threefold risk of having asthma at 6 years. HRV wheezing in year 2 was associated with a more pronounced increase in asthma risk (odds ratio [OR] ~7), while HRV-related wheezing during year 3 of life was associated with an even dramatic (OR ~32) increase in asthma at school age. 42 A similar birth cohort study in Australia reported that HRV-related wheezing in infancy was associated with an increased asthma risk at 5 years. 43 The exact mechanisms by which HRV triggers or contributes to the inflammatory changes often seen in asthma is unclear, but it is suggested that it evolves from a combination of host susceptibility, other aeroallergen sensitization and the ability of HRV to activate proinflammatory and airway remodeling pathways. 44 ",

There appears to be a seasonality in HRV-C infections, with a peak incidence in the fall and winter, as well as the rainy season in tropical countries, but also occurring throughout the year. 31 HRV-C infection has a predilection for the young, with most infections occurring in children less than 5 years of age, especially those below the age of 36 months. 32 Part of the apparent rise in rhinovirus C infection may be due to improved virus detection methods that have led to an increase in its recognition as a cause of severe pneumonia in the elderly and the immunocompromised, specifically in pediatric oncology and patients who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",
