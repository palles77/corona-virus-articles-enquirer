The isolation of the causal agent and the development of serological tests made it possible to distinguish La Crosse encephalitis from the rubric of \"arbovirus encephalitis, etiology unknown.\" Since that time, about 100 cases have been reported annually, without any significant increase since the 1970s. It appears that the emergence of this \"new\" disease reflected only the newfound ability to identify this etiologic entity, rather than any true change in its occurrence. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is another example of the \"emergence\" of an existing but previously unrecognized disease. In 1993, in the four corners area of the southwestern United States, there occurred a small outbreak of cases of acute pulmonary illness with a high mortality. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigation rapidly identified the causal agent, a previously unknown hantavirus, now named Sin Nombre virus (SNV). SNV is an indigenous virus of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) that are persistently infected and excrete the virus. Apparently deer mice produce virus-infected excreta and, when they infest human dwellings, aerosolized fomites can result in occasional human infections. The 1993 outbreak is thought to reflect a transient rise in deer mouse populations associated with an unusual crop of pine nuts, a major food source for these rodents. The recognition of SNV soon led to the discovery of other heretofore unrecognized hantaviruses in North, Central and South America, many of which also cause serious human disease.",

            "text": "On occasion, a virus that is already widespread in a population can emerge as a cause of epidemic or endemic disease, due to an increase in the ratio of cases to infections. Such an increase can be caused by either an increase in host susceptibility or enhancement of the virulence of the virus. Although counterintuitive, there are some dramatic instances of such phenomena. Increase in host susceptibility. Poliomyelitis first appeared as a cause of summer outbreaks of acute infantile paralysis in Sweden and the United States late in the nineteenth century (Figure 1 ). Isolated cases of infantile paralysis had been recorded in prior centuries, and an Eygptian tomb painting indicates that poliomyelitis probably occurred in early recorded history. Why then did poliomyelitis emerge abruptly as an epidemic disease? When personal hygiene and public health were primitive, poliovirus circulated as a readily transmitted enterovirus, and most infants were infected while they still carried maternal antibodies (up to 9-12 months of age). Under these circumstances, the virus produced immunizing infections of the enteric tract, but passively acquired circulating antibodies prevented invasion of the spinal cord. With the improvement of personal hygiene in the late-nineteenth century, infections were delayed until 1-3 years of age, after the waning of maternal antibodies. Infections now occurred in susceptible children, resulting in outbreaks of infantile paralysis. This reconstruction is supported by seroepidemiological studies conducted in North Africa in the 1950s, when epidemic poliomyelitis first emerged in this region. Increase in viral virulence. Viruses may undergo sudden increases in virulence resulting in emergence of dramatic outbreaks. An outbreak of lethal avian influenza in Pennsylvania in 1983 is one documented example. In eastern Pennsylvania, avian influenza appeared in chicken farms early in 1983, but the virus was relatively innocuous and most infections were mild. However, in the fall of that year a fatal influenza pandemic spread rapidly through the same farms. When viruses from the spring and fall were compared, it appeared that both isolates had almost identical genomes. The fall virus had acquired a single point mutation in the viral hemagglutinin that facilitated the cleavage of the hemagglutinin. The virus could now replicate outside the respiratory tract, markedly increasing its virulence (discussed in Chapter 7, Patterns of infection). This point mutation led to the emergence of an overwhelming epizootic, which was only controlled by a widespread slaughter program involving millions of birds. Similar outbreaks of avian influenza have occurred subsequently in other countries.",

If the virus is then reintroduced, it can \"reemerge\" as an acute outbreak. In the years 1900-1950, Iceland had a population of about 200,000, which was too small to maintain measles virus, and measles periodically disappeared. When travelers to Iceland reintroduced the virus, measles reemerged in epidemic proportions.",

            "text": "On occasion, a virus can enter and spread in a region where it had never previously circulated, leading to the emergence of a disease new to that locale. A dramatic example is afforded by the emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States, beginning in 1999 ( Figure 2 ). WNV, like most arboviruses, is usually confined to a finite geographic area, based on the range of its vertebrate reservoir hosts and permissive vectors. In an unusual event, WNV was imported into New York City, probably by the introduction of infected vector mosquitoes that were inadvertent passengers on a flight from the Middle East, where the virus is enzootic. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that the genomic sequence of the New York isolates was closely related to the sequence of contemporary isolates from Israel. Some American mosquito species were competent vectors for WNV, and certain avian species such as American crows were highly susceptible. As a result, West Nile encephalitis emerged as a significant disease new to the United States. Over a period of several years WNV spread across the continent, finally reaching the west coast and many areas in Latin America. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), another mosquito-borne arbovirus, has been endemic for many years in regions of Africa and Asia where it periodically caused outbreaks of a febrile illness associated with severe arthritis and arthralgia. In 2005-2006, CHIKV caused a large epidemic on the island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean, apparently associated with a mutation that allowed the virus to be more efficiently transmitted by vector mosquitoes. Chikungunya subsequently spread to India and elsewhere in Asia, followed by the Americas. As of November 2014, transmission of CHIKV had been documented in 40 countries or territories in the Caribbean, Central, South and North America, resulting in nearly one million suspected cases each year. It appears that CHIKV may become established in the New World, where virtually the entire human population currently lacks immunity.",

Humans are infected by bite of a rabid animal or by aerosol exposure (in caves with roosting bats). Several zoonotic arenaviruses, such as Lassa, Machupo (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever), and Junin (Argentine hemorrhagic fever) viruses, are likely transmitted from the reservoir host (wild rodents) by inhalation of contaminated aerosols. There are more than 500 viruses-belonging to several virus families-that are also classified as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses), based on a vertebrate-arthropod maintenance cycle in nature. Arboviruses replicate in both the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector (mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies, and others), and transmission occurs when the vector takes a blood meal. Typically, arboviruses have only a few vertebrate hosts and are transmitted by a narrow range of arthropods. Humans are not the reservoir vertebrate hosts of most arboviruses, but can be infected by many of these viruses, if they happen to be bitten by an infected vector. In most instances, arbovirus-infected humans are dead-end hosts for several reasons. Many arthropod vectors competent to transmit a zoonotic arbovirus prefer nonhuman hosts as a blood source, reducing the likelihood of transmission from human to vector. Also, infected humans are usually not sufficiently permissive to experience a high titer viremia, so they cannot serve as effective links in the transmission cycle. There are only a few exceptions: in urban settings, dengue, urban yellow fever, Oropouche, and Chikungunya viruses can be maintained by an arthropod vector-human cycle.",

These viruses belong to many different virus families, and there is no obvious biological clue why they should be able to spread from human to human, in contrast to other closely related viruses. Typically, infections are mainly limited to caregivers or family members who have intimate contact with patients, often in a hospital setting. However, transmission is marginal, so that most outbreaks end after fewer than 5-10 serial transmissions, either spontaneously or due to infection-control practices. ",

SARS coronavirus. In November, 2002, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) began in Guangdong Province, in southeast China near the Hong Kong border. In retrospect, the first cases were concentrated in food handlers, who then spread the virus to the general population in that region. Although not recognized immediately as a new disease, the outbreak continued to spread both locally and in other parts of China. In February, 2003, a physician who had been treating likely SARS patients, traveled to Hong Kong, where he transmitted SARS to a large number of contacts in a hotel. These persons, in turn, spread the infection to Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Canada, initiating a global pandemic that eventually involved almost 30 countries. From patient samples, several research groups isolated a novel coronavirus, which has been named the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). Clearly, this virus is new to the human population, and there is circumstantial evidence that it was contracted from exotic food animals that are raised for sale in restaurants in Guangdong Province. Recent studies suggest that horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) may be the reservoir hosts and palm civets, consumed as food in China, may be the intermediary hosts for SARS CoV.",

From that perspective, it is potentially capable of becoming an indigenous virus of humans. Since many coronaviruses infect the respiratory system and are transmitted by the respiratory route, the SARS virus did not have to undergo any change in its pathogenesis. However, the virus did have to replicate efficiently in cells of the human respiratory tract and it is unknown whether this required some adaptive mutations from the virus that is enzootic in its reservoir hosts.",

Based on fragmentary data now available, it appears that MERS-CoV is likely to be an enzootic virus of one or more species of bats. Camels are probably an intermediary host, and humans in close contact with camels can acquire infection. Also, MERS-CoV can spread from human to human, particularly to caretakers or others in close contact with acutely ill patients. However, there are many unknowns in this speculative reconstruction: How do camels become infected? Are camels the main source of human infections?

This would facilitate the transmission of this zoonotic infection from bats to camels to humans.

Genetic evidence strongly implicates avian and porcine type A influenza viruses as the source of some past pandemics of human influenza. It appears that new epidemic strains are often derived as reassortants between the hemagglutinin (and the neuraminidase in some cases) of avian influenza viruses with other genes of existing human influenza viruses. The new surface proteins provide a novel antigenic signature to which many humans are immunologically na\u00efve.

Of these, the most important was the M group of HIV-1, which has been responsible for the vast majority of human infections. Furthermore, HIV-1 is most closely related to SIVcpz, the SIV strain infecting two subpopulations of chimpanzees. Different segments of the SIVcpz genome, in turn, are closely related to genome segments of two SIVs of African monkeys, red-capped monkeys and Cercopithecus monkeys. It is hypothesized that chimpanzees, which regularly kill and eat monkeys, were infected during consumption of their prey; and that a recombination event produced SIVcpz, which was derived from parts of the genomes of the two acquired monkey viruses. It is speculated that a further transmission from chimpanzees may have occurred during the butchering of nonhuman primates, which occurs in rural Africa ( Figure 5) .",

In the countries worst affected, the prevalence of infection among adults aged 15-49 years reached levels higher than 30%. The rapid spread was driven by many factors among which were: (1) a high frequency of concurrent sexual contacts in some segments of the population and the hidden nature of sexual networks; (2) the long asymptomatic incubation period during which infected individuals able to transmit the virus were sexually active; (3) the spread along commercial routes of travel within Africa; (4) the failure of health systems to Concomitantly with the spread of HIV in Africa, the M group of HIV-1 evolved into nine different subtypes (A-D, F-H, J, K), based on sequence diversity. During the spread within Africa, there were population bottlenecks that resulted in the predominance of different M group subtypes in different regions. Subtype C is most frequent in southern Africa, and subtypes A and D are most frequent in eastern Africa. During the 1980s, HIV also spread globally, although prevalence rates did not reach the levels seen in some African countries. Subtype B is dominant in the western hemisphere and Europe, while subtype C is most frequent in India and some other Asian countries.

The virus infects mononuclear cells including macrophages and dendritic cells and traffics to lymph nodes, whence it spreads to target organs including the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands. It causes a high titer viremia and a dysregulation of the innate immune system. Clinically, Ebola patients undergo severe vomiting and diarrhea with massive fluid losses and become very dehydrated, with a mortality that varies from 25% to 75%. In fatal cases, the infection of the liver leads to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, a shock syndrome, and multiorgan failure, although the sequential details are not well understood. Infection is transmitted between humans by contact with bodily fluids of patients, but not by aerosols. Therefore, the virus is spread most frequently to caregivers or others who are in intimate contact with patients and their fomites. Rituals associated with funerals and burial practices often serve to transmit the virus.",

The outbreak then spread to two contiguous countries, Liberia and Sierra Leone. By the fall, 2014, the epidemic had become a catastrophe, and was raging out of control in several parts of these three countries. Although the data are incomplete, it is estimated that there have been at least 20,000 cases (with at least 50% mortality) through February, 2015 (Figure 7) . The infection has spread to Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, the United States, and a few European countries, but these invasions have so far been controlled, with limited secondary cases. A global effort to control this pandemic was initiated, with participation from Doctors without Borders, the Red Cross, other nongovernment organizations, the World Health Organization, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of March, 2015, it appeared that the epidemic was coming under control. Aggressive border screening, both on exit from the affected countries and on arrival at destinations, has limited spread by air travelers, but the porous land borders remain areas of concern. From an epidemiological viewpoint, why did this outbreak of Ebola explode into a massive pandemic, in contrast to the many prior outbreaks that were limited to no more than a few hundred cases at most? The outbreak began in Guinea and was mainly confined to that country for about 6 months before it spread to neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone (Figure 8 ). During this first 6 months, incidence in Guinea varied from a few to about 50 cases a week, and cases were concentrated in rural areas. From a public health viewpoint, this represented a missed opportunity to contain the outbreak. Contributing to this omission were a combination of factors: a weak health system fragmented by social disruption, a failure of local health authorities to recognize or respond to the outbreak, the failure of international health organizations such as WHO to take aggressive action, and local societal norms that brought family and friends into close contact with Ebola victims, during their illness and at their funerals (Washington Post, October 5, 2014; Cohen, 2014) .

A major effort was made to get the local population to temporarily change some of their normal social responses to illness and death, to reduce the spread within the population. Combined with the efforts of the affected countries, these initiatives started to take hold about January, 2015. However, as of March, 2015, the epidemic was not yet terminated. In retrospect, the international community has acknowledged that it lacks a contingency plan to respond to global outbreaks wherever they may occur. Futhermore, because Ebola was a \"neglected\" disease, the tools to combat it had not been developed. The Ebola pandemic has spurred crash programs to develop a rapid diagnostic test, drugs and antibodies for treatment, and a vaccine for prevention (Product, 2015; Mire et al., 2015) . Canine parvovirus. CPV is another example of a disease that emerged due to the appearance of a virus new to its host species. In the late 1970s, a highly lethal pandemic disease appeared in the dog populations of the world. The etiologic agent was a parvovirus previously unknown in canines. The sequence of CPV is almost identical to that of feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), an established parvovirus of cats, which causes acutely fatal disease in kittens. CPV has a few point mutations that distinguish it from FPV, and these mutations permit CPV to bind to and infect canine cells, a property not possessed by FPV. It is presumed that these mutations permitted the emergence of a new virus disease of dogs.",

Several recent studies have shown that APOBEC3 and tetherin are two very important gate keepers for transmission of lentiviruses between different primate species (reviewed in Sharp and Hahn, 2011) . APOBEC3 proteins represent a powerful first line of defense, believed to be responsible for preventing the transmission of SIVs from monkeys to chimpanzees and from monkeys to humans (Etienne et al., 2013) . However, APOBEC3 proteins can be counteracted by the HIV/SIV viral infectivity factor (Vif), albeit generally in a species-specific fashion. Thus, mutations in Vif were required for monkey SIVs to be able to infect chimpanzees and then humans (Letko et al., 2013) . Tetherin is a second line of defense, and only HIVs that have evolved an effective tetherin antagonism have spread widely in humans (Kluge et al., 2014) . Different lentiviruses use different viral proteins to antagonize tetherin: HIV-1 group M uses the viral protein U (Vpu); HIV-2 group A uses the envelope glycoprotein (Env), and HIV-1 group O uses the negative regulatory factor (Nef). In contrast, HIV-1 groups N and P, whose spread in the human population has remained very limited, are unable to counteract tetherin efficiently.",

Someone can be infected in one location and-within a single incubation period-arrive at any other site on earth. This enhances the opportunity for a new human virus to spread as a global infection before it has even been recognized, markedly increasing the opportunity for the emergence of a new disease. The same dynamics also apply to viral diseases of animals and plants, which has important economic and social consequences for humankind. The SARS pandemic of 2002-2003, described above, is an example of how rapidly and widely a new virus disease can emerge and spread globally. In this instance, it is extraordinary that the disease was brought under control-and eradicated from the human population-by the simple methods of isolation, quarantine, and respiratory precautions. Although conceptually simple, a heroic effort was required for success. Another example is the 2009 emergence of a novel H1N1 strain of influenza A virus that spread rapidly around the world before a vaccine could be produced.",

Furthermore, increasing numbers of plants, animals, and food products are rapidly transported over large distances; we enjoy fresh fruits and vegetables at any time, regardless of the season. International shipment of plants and animals can import viruses into new settings where they may lead to the emergence of unforeseen diseases. One example is the 2003 outbreak of monkeypox that caused about 80 human cases in the United States. This was traced to the importation from Africa of Gambian giant rats as exotic pets; several rodent species in west Africa appear to be reservoir hosts of this poxvirus. Monkeypox spread from these animals to pet prairie dogs and from prairie dogs to their owners. Because monkeypox causes infections in humans that resemble mild cases of smallpox, this outbreak was a major cause of public health concern.",

To control this problem, myxomatosis virus was deliberately introduced in 1950 (Fenner, 1983) . This poxvirus is transmitted mechanically by the bite of insects and is indigenous to wild rabbits in South America, in which it causes nonlethal skin tumors. However, myxomatosis virus causes an acutely lethal infection in European rabbits, and its introduction in Australia resulted in a pandemic in the rabbit population. Following the introduction of myxomatosis virus in 1950, co-evolution of both virus and host were observed. The introduced strain was highly virulent and caused epizootics with very high mortality. However, with the passage of time field isolates exhibited reduced virulence, and there was a selection for rabbits that were genetically somewhat resistant to the virus. Strains of moderate virulence probably became dominant because strains of lowest virulence were less transmissible and strains of maximum virulence killed rabbits very quickly.",

First, a disease outbreak that cannot be attributed to a known pathogen may set off a race to identify a potentially new infectious agent. Identification of the causal agent will aid in the control of the disease and in prevention or preparedness for potential future epidemics. SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus, and Sin Nombre Virus are examples of emergent viruses that were identified in the wake of outbreaks, using both classical and modern methods. Alternatively, an important new virus may be discovered as a serendipitous by-product of research directed to a different goal, as was the case with hepatitis B virus (HBV). In this instance, a search for alloantigens uncovered a new serum protein that turned out to be the surface antigen (HBsAg) of HBV, leading to the discovery of the virus. When a disease outbreak cannot be attributed to a known pathogen, and where classical virus isolation, propagation, and identification fail, molecular virology is required. Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Sin Nombre and other hantaviruses, certain rotaviruses, and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (HHV8) , are examples of emergent viruses that were first discovered as a result of molecular technologies.

It was conjectured that it might be possible to visualize a putative fastidious virus by electron microscopy of concentrated fecal specimens. When patients' convalescent serum was added to filtered and concentrated stool specimens, aggregates of 70 nm virions were observed in stools from some infants with acute gastroenteritis. The ability of convalescent but not acute illness serum to mediate virion aggregation provided a temporal association of the immune response with an acute diarrheal illness.
