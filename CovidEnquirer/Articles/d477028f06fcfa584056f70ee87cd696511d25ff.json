In this study, we constructed a recombinant porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (vP129/swIL1\u2424) expressing swine IL-1\u2424 from the separate subgenomic mRNA inserted between the ORF1b and ORF2 genome region. MARC-145 cells infected with vP129/swIL1\u2424 secreted 1947 pg of IL-1\u2424 per 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells at 36 h post-infection. In vitro growth kinetics analysis in MARC-145 cells showed that the vP129/swIL1\u2424 virus had a similar replication rate as that of parental virus. We further performed in vivo characterization of the vP129/swIL1\u2424 virus in a nursery pig disease model. The vP129/swIL1\u2424 infected pigs did not show visible clinical signs, while respiratory distress and lethargy were evident in pigs infected with the parental virus. The expression of various cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells measured by fluorescent microsphere immunoassay showed that IL-1\u2424, IL-4 and IFN-\u2425 expression levels were up-regulated in pigs infected with vP129/swIL1\u2424 at 7 and 14 days post-infection. However, no detectable level of IL-1\u2424 was found in serum samples from pigs infected with either vP129/swIL1\u2424 or parental virus. In summary, this study demonstrated a recombinant PRRSV as a useful tool to study the role of different cytokines in disease progression and immune responses, which represents a new strategy for future therapeutic application and vaccine development.",

            "text": "Cytokines are signaling molecules for intercellular communication such as the induction of immune responses by recruiting immune cells and regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. During viral infection, cytokines play a central role in the innate and adaptive immunity. For example, both Type I and II interferons (IFNs), and various interleukins (ILs) play crucial roles in the control of viral replication at the early stage of virus infection. The innate cytokines are also important in the induction of adaptive immunity specific to the infecting virus by inducing inflammation responses. The excessive inflammation due to viral infection-mediated cytokine production may also lead to immunopathic conditions and pathogenicity of the viral infections. Because of the important role that cytokines play in the immune response, cytokines have been studied for their application in therapeutic treatment and in vaccine formulations (Andersson and Tracey, 2011; Heegaard et al., 2011; Leong et al., 1994) . However, since cytokines have a short half-life and require large dose administration systemically in order to be fully functional, new methods to deliver cytokines to the site of infection have been developed, including the creation of chimeric molecules, delivery vehicles, and the use of viral vectors to express cytokines (Ahlers et al., 2003; Yilma et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a small-enveloped virus containing a single positive-stranded RNA genome. PRRSV is classified in the Order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . Nucleotide sequence comparisons show that PRRSV can be divided into distinct European (Type I) and North American (Type II) genotypes, possessing only about 63% nucleotide identity at the genomic level (Allende et al., 1999; Nelsen et al., 1999) . PRRSV causes mild to severe respiratory disease in infected newborn and growing swine, and reproductive failure in pregnant sows (Rossow et al., 1995; Rossow, 1998) . PRRSV infection stimulates a minimal level of innate cytokine production. The inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u2424, IL-6 and IL-8, have been detected in virus-infected pigs (Aasted et al., 2002; Thanawongnuwech and Thacker, 2003; Bassaganya-Riera et al., 2004; Thanawongnuwech et al., 2004; Lunney et al., 2010) . However, in comparison to the other strong immunogenic swine pathogens, such as swine influenza virus and pseudorabies virus, the quantities of secreted cytokines appeared to be much lower. It is suggested that such poor innate anti-viral IFN and cytokine responses result in a weak adaptive immune response.",

Currently available modified live vaccines have shown the most promising efficacy but have only been partially successful in protection against a wide array of heterologous PRRSV isolates in the field (B\u00f8tner et al., 1997; Mengeling, 2005) . In the effort of new vaccine development, cytokines have been evaluated as adjuvants during the immunization of animals (Zuckermann et al., 1998 (Zuckermann et al., , 1999 Somasundaram et al., 1999; Foss et al., 2002; Murtaugh et al., 2002; Boyaka et al., 2003; Petrovsky and Aguilar, 2004; Royaee et al., 2004) . Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a potent inflammatory mediator in response to infection. IL-1\u2424 has been tested as an immunological adjuvant because of its ability to influence a broad spectrum of biological activities within the immune system. It was reported that co-administration of recombinant bovine IL-1\u2424 and a modified live BHV-1 vaccine was able to enhance both the humoral and cellular immune response against BHV-1 (Reddy et al., 1990 (Reddy et al., , 1993 . A recombinant BHV-1 expressing bovine IL-1\u2424 showed that both cellular and secreted forms of recombinant IL-1\u2424 possessed biological activity, and the expression of IL-1\u2424 protein did not affect the in vitro growth efficiency of the virus (Raggo et al., 1996) . In this study, we explored the strategy of manipulating the immunogenic properties of a virus by expression of a swine IL-1\u2424 (swIL1\u2424) protein using a PRRSV reverse genetic system. A recombinant PRRSV, designated vP129/swIL1\u2424, was generated. This recombinant virus was further tested in a nursery pig model to determine whether swine IL-1\u2424 could be successfully delivered in vivo. The effect of in vivo expression of swine IL-1\u2424 on the pathogenic property of the virus as well as the PRRSV specific immune response was further examined.",

To detect the IL-1\u2424 protein expression in infected cells, Western blot was conducted. As shown in Fig. 1B , a protein band with apparent molecular weight between 17 and 20 kDa was recognized by anti-swIL1\u2424 antibody in the cellular and supernatant fractions of vP129/swIL1\u2424 infected cells, but not in the wild-type virus infected cells.

As shown in Table 1 , all pigs inoculated by parental virus developed clinical signs, showing respiratory distress (coughing, serious nasal discharge) and lethargy, and four pigs had rectal temperatures over 40 \u2022 C during the second and third day postinoculation. In contrast, no apparent clinical signs were observed in those pigs inoculated by vP129/swIL1\u2424 virus, and rectal temperature was normal for this group of pigs through the time course of the study.

Its effects result in a weak adaptive immune response as demonstrated by prolonged viremia, short duration of cell-mediated immune responses and slow development of virus-specific IFN-\u2425 secreting cells. Anti-PRRSV neutralizing antibodies are generated slowly and their titers remain low. There is an extensive body of literature describing the innate interferon and cytokine effect on PRRSV replication and cytokine-mediated events that occur during PRRSV infection. In an earlier study, inoculation of pigs with porcine respiratory coronavirus, a potent inducer of innate cytokines, provided protection from a subsequent PRRSV infection (Buddaert et al., 1998) . Overend et al. (2007) showed that recombinant swine IFN-\u2424 protects swine alveolar macrophages from infection with PRRSV. Royaee et al. (2004) showed that using an expression Fig. 4 .

PBMCs were harvested at 3, 7 and 14 dpi and stimulated in culture with PHA or medium. Cell culture supernatants and pellets were harvested at 24 h post-stimulation. Cytokine protein expression was determined by Luminex fluorescent microsphere immunoassay. Each data point was interpolated using a five-parameter logistic regression curve and displayed as a mean fluorescent unit from three animals with the standard deviation. Different letters (\"a\", \"b\" and \"c\") represent mean cytokine level of different groups differs significantly (P < 0.05). plasmid encoding porcine IFN-\u2423 as an adjuvant resulted in a temporary increase in the frequency of PRRSV specific IFN-\u2425 secreting cells in the vaccinated animals. These results all support an important role of IFNs and cytokines in the initial innate immune response and the subsequent activation of adaptive immunity. However, with PRRSV infection, innate immune genes and proteins expression is suppressed and delayed (Van Reeth et al., 1999 Murtaugh et al., 2002) . This initial suppression of the innate Results were interpreted as a 90% reduction of the viral infection, and the neutralizing antibody titers were presented as mean value (n = 6) and expressed on a log2 scale.

            "text": "immune response, leading to the delayed induction of protective cellular and humoral immunity, provides a window of time that allows PRRSV to replicate, shed and transmit to other contact na\u00efve animals. Therefore, current strategies for vaccine development are directed at constructing a PRRS vaccine capable of inducing a high level of innate and cellular immune responses and robust neutralizing antibody activity within a short period of time after vaccination. The use of cytokines as adjuvants for enhancing the viral specific immune response has been investigated in both subunit and modified live vaccines (Heath and Playfair, 1992; Gao et al., 1995; Godson et al., 1995; Ahlers et al., 2003; Yilma et al., 2010; Heegaard et al., 2011) . In particular, IL-1\u2424 has been tested as a potent immune modulator in vaccine development. The recombinant bovine IL-1\u2424 has been tested as an adjuvant to co-administrate with a modified live BHV-1 vaccine, and an in vivo study showed enhanced humoral and cellular immune response. Although the study demonstrated the effect of IL-1\u2424 on the enhancement of host immunity, the systemic administration of IL-1\u2424 to develop an adjuvant effect requires a large dose of recombinant IL-1\u2424 and multiple injections at a local site. This could result in severe side effects and is not cost-effective in veterinary medicine. The use of recombinant virus as a vector to express the cytokines, such as IL-1\u2424, has the potential to overcome these drawbacks. The viral vector system allows delivery of the cytokine to the specific site of infection. It reduces the dose requirement and thereby decreases the cost and side effects. A number of cytokines have been tested by inserting into recombinant viruses (Bembridge et al., 1998; Karaca et al., 1998; Giavedoni et al., 1997; Leong et al., 1994; Flexner et al., 1990) . For example, expression of IFN-\u2425 by recombinant respiratory syncytial virus attenuated the virus in vivo and protected animals from subsequent challenge with wild type virus (Bukreyev et al., 1999) . In vaccinia virus, expression of IL-2 attenuated the virus while maintained the immunogenicity in vivo (Flexner et al., 1990) . In our study, a recombinant PRRSV (vP129/swIL1\u2424) was constructed, which expresses the IL-1\u2424 gene as a separate mRNA from an additional transcriptional product placed between ORF1b and ORF2 genome region. The recombinant virus produced high levels of IL-1\u2424 protein in cell culture. In vitro growth kinetics analysis indicated that the production of swIL1\u2424 was not toxic to the cells and did not affect viral replication. In comparison to the parental virus, the vP129/swIL1\u2424 virus grew to a viral titer similar to that of the parental virus in MARC-145 cells. This property is important for recombinant vaccine development. Genetic manipulation/attenuation of the live virus are typically accompanied by reduced viral titer. However, to achieve a satisfactory level of immunogenicity, the virus titer must be adequately maintained. The ability to produce high titers of vP129/swIL1\u2424 virus in vitro makes it easy to produce sufficient quantities for large-scale vaccine production. In addition, the large amount of recombinant IL-1\u2424 protein produced by the recombinant virus could be an alternative method for the in vitro production of recombinant cytokines.",

            "text": "We further demonstrated that the recombinant PRRSV could be used as an in vivo cytokine delivery system to study the mechanism of different cytokine effects on disease progression. First, the expression of IL-1\u2424 by vP129/swIL1\u2424 did not show a difference in viral load in the sera compared to those by the parental virus in animals. Also, our data showed that the IL-1\u2424 gene is maintained in the virus isolated from serum samples of the vP129/swIL1\u2424 infected pigs. Most importantly, the in vivo co-expression of swIL1\u2424 attenuated the pathogenic property of the virus. The parental virus P129 is known to be a highly pathogenic virus (Calvert et al., 2002 (Calvert et al., , 2003 . Results from our study demonstrated that parental P129 virus infected pigs showed significant symptoms of lethargy and respiratory distress. In contrast, the swIL1\u2424 expressing vP129/swIL1\u2424 virus infected pigs did not show apparent clinical symptoms. It is not clear why the expression of IL-1\u2424 by vP129/swIL1\u2424 resulted in attenuated symptoms in the animals. Initially, we hypothesized that vP129/swIL1\u2424 might be more virulent than the parental virus because of the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u2424. It is possible that the attenuation may be related to the site (alveolar region) of virus replication and the expression of the cytokine where the anti-inflammatory mechanism is strong (Spight et al., 2005) . Another interesting phenomenon related to this is that although the viral load in blood was similar, a higher level of viral load in tissues (tonsil, lymph nodes, and lung) was observed in pigs infected with vP129/swIL1\u2424 at 28 dpi. In this case, the viral load at the local tissues did not correlate with the disease progression, since the vP129/swIL1\u2424 infected pigs did not develop apparent clinical symptoms and no significant lung lesion was observed. It is possible that the continued expression of IL-1\u2424 in virus infected cells may promote virus replication by recruiting monocytes to differentiate into macrophages in the local tissues. Currently, we are investigating the potential mechanism of the attenuation by IL-1\u2424 in virus-infected animals.",

Further analysis of a time course pattern of cytokine proteins expression using a FMIA suggested that the co-expression of IL-1\u2424 could lead to a strong T cell response. In comparison to the parental virus, infection with vP129/swIL1\u2424 resulted in a significant increase of both Th1 marker (IFN-\u2425) and Th2 marker in PBMCs at 14 dpi. The result of the humoral immune response showed that both vP129/swIL1\u2424 and parental virus infected groups had seroconverted by 14 dpi at the same levels (Fig. 5A ). However, a higher level of neutralizing antibody response was observed in the group of pigs infected with vP129/swIL1\u2424 compared to that with parental virus at 28 dpi (Fig. 5B) , which may be due to the strong T cell response by vP129/swIL1\u2424.",

The GFP gene in pCMV-S-P129-1bGFP2 (Kermit) backbone was replaced by swine IL-1\u2424 gene. The IL-1\u2424 is expressed as an independent subgenomic RNA, which was derived from the leader/junction (L/J) sequence of ORF2. The ORF6 L/J was inserted downstream of the IL-1\u2424 gene to drive the expression of ORF2; (B) Western blot analysis of the detection of swIL1\u2424 in the supernatant fraction (sup) or cell lysates (cell lys) of MARC-145 cells infected with vP129/swIL1\u2424 or parental P129 virus.
