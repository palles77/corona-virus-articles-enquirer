            "text": "The active components must be extracted from plant or raw medical material samples prior to analysis by HPLC. Several extraction techniques have been developed [22] [23] [24] . Solid-phase extraction (SPE) is a commonly employed sample preparation method for drug compounds in complex matrices. SPE is used to selectively remove interfering matrix components, leading to reduced time required for chromatographic method development and improved assay selectivity, accuracy, and sensitivity. A method combining solid-phase extraction and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography was recently developed for simultaneous isolation and determination of flavanes (baicalin, baicalein, chrysin, scutellarein) and some phenolic acids in aerial and underground parts of S. baicalensis Georgi [22] . The application of optimized enrichment conditions, elaborated on octadecyl and quaternary amine BakerBond microcolumns, led to the extraction of both groups of analytes with recoveries >95% and variation coefficients <5%. Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is another widely used technique for extraction of active components from plant or raw medical material samples, in which supercritical carbon dioxide is often used as an extraction solvent. The use of carbon dioxide has the following advantages: chemically inert, low toxicity, no pollution problem, and shorter concentration time. Under supercritical conditions, the solubility and diffusivity of the analytes in extraction fluid are increased, leading to improved extraction. For the extraction of polar or ionic compounds, organic solvents are added as modifiers or the compounds are first derivatized to decrease their polarity. SFE was applied to the extraction of baicalin, baicalein and wogonin from S. baicalensis [23] . The optimal conditions of SFE were as follows: supercritical carbon dioxide-methanol-water (20:2.1:0.9), 50 \u2022 C and 200 bar. The SFE method gave high yields of the three flavanoids in shorter time than ultrasonic or percolation extraction. Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) with methanol as solvent was proposed for the extraction of baicalein from Scutellariae radix [24] . The comparable performance of PLE with reference to Soxhlet extraction was due to the higher diffusion rate and higher solubility of analyte in the solvent as a result of the higher temperature. At high temperature, the strong solute-matrix interaction in the plant materials caused by van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding and dipole attractions between solute molecules and active sites on the matrix were disrupted. To reduce the use of organic solvent, pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) was developed for the extraction of baicalein from Scutellariae radix [24] . Ethanol as organic modifier was added into the liquid used in PHWE. PHWE was carried out dynamically at a flow-rate of 1 ml min \u22121 , temperature between 95 and 140 \u2022 C, an applied pressure of 10-20 bar and extraction time of 40 min. Although baicalein was insoluble in water, the results showed that water with a small proportion (20%) of ethanol at a temperature below its boiling point and a small applied pressure was able to extract an equivalent amount of baicalein from medicinal plant compared with Soxhlet extraction with aqueous organic solvent. The results obtained by PHWE were in agreement with those using PLE with methanol as the extraction solvent.",

Baicalin was determined by HPLC on a Hypersil C 18 column (25 cm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d.) with methanol/0.04% H 3 PO 4 (23:27) as mobile phase (1 ml min \u22121 ) and detection at 280 nm [25] . The method was applied to the determination of baicalin in the raw medical materials and two different processing drugs of S. baicalensis, and the contents of baicalin were 6.8, 6.0 and 6.73%, respectively. Although the method was simple, only one component was determined in a single run. In another method, two components were determined by HPLC in a single run on an YMC-Pack ODS A-132 column (15 cm \u00d7 6 mm i.d.) with methanol/0.1M phosphate buffer as mobile phase (1:1 for baicalin and wogonin, or 17:8 for baicalein and wogonin 7-O-glucuronide) and detection at 270 nm [26] . The method was applied to the comparative study of the concentrations of four flavonoids in two Scutellaria species (S.). The concentrations of baicalin, baicalein, wogonin and wogonin 7-O-glucuronide were 12.77, 3.53, 0.93 and 3.56 and 14.40, 3.08, 0.97 and 2.99%, respectively in S. planipes and S. baicalensis. Actually, more components could be determined simultaneously by HPLC [27] [28] [29] . The three components, baicalin, baicalein and wogonin in Scutellariae radix were determined by HPLC on a 10 m ODS Hypersil column (25 cm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d.) with gradient elution of acetonitrile and 0.1 M H 3 PO 4 as mobile phase and detection at 280 nm [27] . The six main bioactive components, baicalein, baicalin, wogonin, wogonin glucuronide, oroxylin-A and oroxylin-A glucuronide in Scutellariae radix could be determined simultaneously by ion-pair highperformance liquid chromatography on a stainless-steel column (15 cm \u00d7 4 mm i.d.) packed with TSK gel LS-410 (5 m) with aqueous 32% acetonitrile, containing 5 mM tetrapentylammonium bromide, as mobile phase, adjusted to pH 4 with H 3 PO 4 [28] . Oroxylin-A and its glucuronide were separated for the first time. The method was one of the best methods for the simultaneous determination of main active components in S. baicalensis Georgi. In another study, flavonoid constituents of the roots of S. baicalensis Georgi were determined by HPLC on a column ( [29] . By a combination of two mobile phases, total 11 flavonoids were separated in two runs. In addition, the content of the main flavonoids in the roots of S. baicalensis Georgi cultivated in Central Europe was evaluated by an HPLC method with gradient of acetonitrile in mobile phase [30] . The main components of the roots were baicalin (8.12% of dry root mass) and wogonin glucuronide (2.52%). The content of flavonoids was comparable with the content in plants cultivated in natural localities.",

HPLC methods have been also applied to the determination of baicalin and chlorogenic acid in Yinhuang oral liquid [41] , baicalin and berberine in Wanshi Niuhuang Qingxin Wan [42] , baicalin and puerarin in medicinal preparations [43] , baicalin, sennoside A and glycyrrhizin in Niuhuangjiedupian [44] , baicalin, paeoniflorin and ferulic acid in Dang-Guei-San [45] . In these methods, reversed-phase columns such as C 18 are the most frequently used. Mobile phases usually consist of a combination of an acidic buffer (or an aqueous phase with an acid H 3 PO 4 or acetic acid as additive) and an organic solvent component, usually methanol or acetonitrile. The use of an acid modifier is to suppress ionization of the acidic groups and interactions of these groups with residual traces of metals in the stationary phase that are detrimental to peak shape.",

The six components, paeoniflorin, cinnamic acid, baicalin, baicalein, wogonin and glycyrrhizin in medicinal preparation Chai-Hu-Kuei-Chih-Tang were determined by HPLC [49] . Commercial powdered sample was ultrasonicated with 70% methanol and filtered. The filtrate was analysed on a Cosmosil 5 C 18 -AR column (25 cm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d.) with linear gradient elution of acetonitrile/aqueous 20 mM H 3 PO 4 as mobile phase and UV detection. The seven constituents, gentiopicroside, mangiferin, palmatine, berberine, baicalin, wogonin and glycyrrhizin in the traditional Chinese medicinal preparation Sann-Joong-Kuey-Jian-Tang could also be determined by HPLC [50] . Decoctions of the crude drug and concentrated preparations were diluted with aqueous 70% methanol, mixed with n-propylparaben as internal standard and analysed on a Cosmosil 5C 18 -MS column (15 cm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d.) with gradient elution of 0.03% H 3 PO 4 /acetonitrile as mobile phase and detection at 254 nm. The chromatogram is shown in Fig. 2 . In another method, twelve constituents, baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, wogonin 7-O-glucuronide, oroxylin A 7-O-glucuronide, sennoside A, sennoside B, emodin, aloe-emodin, glycyrrhizin, ferulic acid and caffeic acid in a Chinese herbal preparation I-Tzu-Tang were determined simultaneously by HPLC on a 5 m reversed-phase Cosmosil 5C 18 -AR column (25 cm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d.) eluted at a flow rate of 0.8 ml min \u22121 with a linear solvent gradient of tetrabutylammonium bromide/phosphorate buffer/methonal/acetonitrile as mobile phase and diode array detection at 254 nm [51] . The chromatogram is shown in Fig. 3 . Furthermore, a method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 14 constituents, baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, wogonoside, oroxylin-A glucoside, orxylin-A, paconiflorin, glycyrrhizic acid, glycyrrhetinic acid, liquiritin, isoliquirition, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin and ononin in the traditional Chinese medicinal preparation Huangqin-Tang by HPLC [52] . Huangqin-Tang samples were mixed and boiled with water, centrifuged then concentrated and analysed on a 5 m Wakosil II 5C 18 -AR column (15 cm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d.), methanol/acetic acid and H 2 O/acetic acid as mobile phase with gradient elution and diode array detection from 200 to 400 nm.",

Baicalin in rabbits' plasma was determined by a reversedphase HPLC [53, 54] . The sample (0.2 ml) was vortex-mixed with 4-nitrobenzoic acid (internal standard) and acetonitrile. The mixture was shaken ultrasonically and centrifuged. The supernatant was analysed on a 5 m Dimonsil C 18 column (20 cm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d.) with methanol-H 2 O-H 3 PO 4 (25:25:0.1) as mobile phase (1 ml min \u22121 ) and detection at 277 nm. In another study, the metabolites of baicalein in human urine were determined by HPLC on a 4 m ODS column (15 cm \u00d7 3.9 mm i.d.) with acetonitrile-0.08 M formic acid (1:4) as mobile phase (1 ml min \u22121 ) and photodiode array detection at 315.6 nm [55] . Three main metabolites of baicalein were identified and found to be in agreement with previous studies. In addition, the flavonoids in human urine after administration of a medicinal preparation Shosaiko-to were determined by HPLC [56] [57] [58] . An ODS or a Chiracel column (25 cm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d.) was used for nonchiral or chiral analysis, respectively. Mobile phases used included acetonitrile/H 2 O/acetic acid for flavonoids, isopropanol/H 2 O/acetic acid for racemic liquiritin, or nhexane/ethanol/acetic acid for chiral analysis. Detection was at 279, 275, and 295 nm for davidigenin and liquiritin, wogonin and oroxylin A and baicalein, and for dihydrowogonin and dihydrooroxylin A, respectively. Four flavonoids, liquiritigenin, baicalein, wogonin and oroxylin A, were found both in the urine and Shosaiko-to. The glycosides in Shosaiko-to were absorbed after microflora hydrolysis. Two flavanones, S-dihydrowogonin and S-dihydrooroxylin A, were identified as the metabolites of wogonin and oroxylin A, respectively.",

The analyte with daidzein as internal standard was determined on a 5 m Diamonsil C 18 column (25 cm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d.) with acetonitrile-H 2 O-formic acid (80:20:1) as mobile phase (0.8 ml min \u22121 ) and tandem positive-ion atmospheric pressure chemical ionization MS detection operated in selectedreaction monitoring mode. In another method, wogonin and its major metabolite in rat plasma was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry [99] . Only one conjugated metabolite with glucuronic acid was identified by chromatographic and electrospray multi-stage MS assay (Fig. 7) . A derivatization reaction with 2-chlorethanol further demonstrated that the metabolite was wogonin 7\u2424d-glucuronide, not wogonin 5\u2424-d-glucuronide. Other conjugated metabolites, e.g., sulfates and glucosides, were not detected. The plasma concentration of free wogonin was determined using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode (Fig. 8) . Incubation of the plasma samples with \u2424-glucuronidase allows the quantitation of wogonin 7\u2424-d-glucuronide.",

The molecular ion peaks of wogonin and baicalein were at m/z 284 and 270, respectively. As to baicalin, its molecular ion peak could not be observed at m/z 446. All crude extracts showed the similar patterns of total ion chromatogram. By comparison of MS fragments with library search software, wogonin was identified. But at the retention time of 20.03 min, fragments of m/z 270 had a relatively low intensity compared with those of m/z 284, 269, 139 and 241. By comparison with the peak intensities of the library database, these peaks may be shown to represent the combinations of many constituents, such as baicalin, baicalein and oroxylin A. Therefore, optimal conditions for separation of the coexisting baicalein and baicalin by GC-MS require further investigation.",

After intravenous administration of baicalein, 75.7% of the dose was circulated as its conjugated metabolites. After oral administration of baicalein, absorption of baicalein itself was negligible, whereas the glucuronides/sulfates of baicalein were predominant in the plasma. When compared with intravenous bolus administration with dose correction, the absolute absorption was 40%. When baicalin was administered orally, glucuronides and sulfates of baicalein were exclusively circulated in the plasma. The relative absorption for baicalin was 65% when compared with baicalein. Profound differences of serum profile and pharmacokinetics were observed between oral baicalein and baicalin. Baicalin demonstrated significantly a time lag to achieve the peak concentration t max , and the lower peak serum concentration (C max ) of baicalein conjugated metabolites compared to baicalein, indicating baicalin was absorbed more slowly and to poorly than baicalein. In addition, the urinary pharmacokinetics of baicalein, wogonin and their glycosides in humans were studied after oral administration of Scutellariae radix [104] . Ten healthy male volunteers received a dose of 5.2 g commercial powder (comparable to 9 g crude drug), respectively. The mean cumulated renal excretion of baicalein glucuronides and sulfates were 43.1 \u00b1 4.5 mol (2.9% of dose) and 64.8 \u00b1 6.3 mol (4.3% of dose), respectively, whereas wogonin glucuronides and sulfates were 21.6 \u00b1 2.0 mol (5.9% of dose) and 20.7 \u00b1 1.7 mol (5.7% of dose), respectively. The renal excretion of conjugated metabolites of wogonin (11.6% of dose) was higher than that of baicalein (7.2% of dose). The baicalein sulfates was predominant than the corresponding glucuronides, whereas wogonin sulfates was comparable to the corresponding glucuronides.",

Huangqin-Tang and all individual herbs in the decoctions were incubated with a human fecal suspension separately. The active con-stituents of Huangqin-Tang, including baicalin, wogonoside, oroxylin-A glucuronide, paconiflorin, liquiritin, isoliquirtin and glycyrrhizic acid, were converted to their metabolites baicalein, wogonin, oroxylin-A, paeonimetabolin-I, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin and glycyrrhetinic acid by human intestinal flora. The contents of the metabolites in Huangqin-Tang and in each single herb decoction increased significantly after incubation with intestinal flora. Comparing with single herb decoctions, the transformation of baicalin, wogonoside, oroxylin-A glucuronide, liquiritin and isoliquirtin in the compound prescription was promoted, however, that of paconiflorin and glycyrrhizic acid was inhibited. All the results suggested that the glycosides of many medicinal herbs could be converted to aglycones by human intestinal flora, and the metabolism of most glycosides was improved in the compound prescription. In another report, the pharmacokinetics of multi-constituents in Huangqin-Tang decoction in rats were studied [106] . At different intervals after oral administration of the Huangqin-Tang decoction or a single herb decoction at a dose of 10 g kg \u22121 , the concentrations of the constituents and their metabolites, baicalin, wogonoside, oroxylin-A glucuronide, baicalein, wogonin, oroxylin-A, paeoniflorin (PF), paeonimetabolin-I, liquiritin, liquiritigenin, glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid, were detected in the rat plasma by HPLC. There were obvious differences in the pharmacoldnetic parameters of most constituents (especially constituent wogonoside) between the compound prescription and single herb decoction. The constituents in the compound prescription had delayed absorption and elimination, a longer residence time in the body, and higher C max and AUC (0-lim), than those in the single herb decoction. Therefore, they were more efficient and durable, making them promising to exerting pharmacological effects in vivo.",

The result indicated that all flavonoid aglycones except baicalein, diosmetin and quercetin were stable in artificial intestinal juice, whereas all were degraded in rabbit, rat and human feces suspension. Wogonin and diosmetin were among the less degraded ones for all three feces tested. The presence of a methoxy group on the A or B ring of the flavonoid seems to protect the structure from bacterial degradation. In addition, the bioavailability of baicalin-phospholipid complex was also studied by HPLC [108] . A complex of baicalin with soy phospholipid was prepared to improve the bioabsorption of baicalin. The concentration of baicalin in rat plasma reached a peak of 0.42 g ml \u22121 at 5.3 h after oral administration, 600 mg kg \u22121 . However, after intake of its phospholipid complex, a peak of 0.90 g ml \u22121 occurred at a later time, 6.1 h. The elimination of the complex tended to be slower than that of the free drug. There was a significant difference in the mean area under the concentration-time curves (AUC) between the free drug and the complex (P < 0.01).",
