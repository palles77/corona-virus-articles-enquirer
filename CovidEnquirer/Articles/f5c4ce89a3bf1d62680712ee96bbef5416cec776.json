            "text": "Protection of health care workers (HCWs) from communicable/ respiratory infections is essential to promote the health and safety of staff and to maintain the functioning and capacity of the health workforce during outbreaks of emerging infections, such as pandemic influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and ebola virus. [1] [2] [3] Infection prevention and control in health care settings involves, among other measures, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), which encompasses all of the specialized equipment worn by HCWs for protection against health and safety hazards, including gloves, eye protection, head and shoe coverings, and respirators/facemasks. 4, 5 In low-resource settings, where the incidence of infectious disease is high and the hospital environmental conditions are often poor, hospitals may rely heavily on PPE to protect staff. The use of facemasks (including medical and cloth masks) and respirators is strongly recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a standard for transmission-based precaution. 4, 5 But even though this practice is highly recommended, actual policies and practices regarding the use of facemasks and respirators vary. 6 For example, whereas the WHO and CDC have the same policy on the use of facemasks/respirators for seasonal influenza, tuberculosis, and ebola virus infection, 4,7-11 they have different recommendations for pandemic influenza and MERS-CoV. 4, 12, 13 Low-and middle-income countries generally adopt policies and guidelines of the WHO and/ or the CDC. 6 The problem is that low-resource countries might not have the ability or finances to adopt infection control policies and respiratory protection guidelines equivalent to those originating from high-resource countries. Therefore, many nonstandardized practices, such as the extended use and reuse of facemasks, are common in low-resource countries; data on these practices are limited, however. Moreover, cloth masks are commonly used in low-resource countries, they are rarely mentioned in infection control policies and guidelines. 14 The appropriate use of facemasks and respirators is important to provide the desired level of protection; however, it requires knowledge, training, and supervision. Compared with other types of PPE, adherence with facemask and respirator use is traditionally low, despite expert recommendations. 15 During a sustained national/international outbreak of a novel viral respiratory infection, health systems may be overwhelmed and existing infection control plans undermined. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences recommended further research into the effectiveness of facemasks/respirators and the factors affecting individuals' willingness and ability to comply with recommendations regarding PPE use. 16 The present study aimed to examine knowledge, attitudes, risk perceptions, and practices regarding the use of facemasks and respirators and barriers to compliance among hospital-based HCWs in Hanoi, Vietnam.",

Before the workshops, an information sheet was provided and participants were asked to provide written informed consent. The focus group sessions ranged in duration from 60 to 90 minutes and were conducted in Vietnamese language. During the sessions, the moderator's interaction with the group consisted primarily of delivering the main open questions, ensuring that the discussions remained relevant to the aim of the study, and encouraging all participants' involvement in the discussions.

            "text": "Our data reveal mixed practices regarding the selection and use of facemasks and respirators by HCWs in hospitals in Hanoi, determined primarily by the type of products available in the hospitals. Perceived risks associated with working in a particular ward or with dealing with particular patients were the primary factors influencing facemask use. The main factors reported as barriers to facemask use appeared to be social (ie, not wanting to offend patients or their family members) and attitudinal (ie, not wanting to frighten children). The literature indicates that HCWs' compliance with facemask use is influenced by individual (risk perception and presence of adverse events) and organizational factors (availability, education, and policies). 18, 19 Providing feedback on HCWs' adherence to precautions and regular communication has been identified as important factors in facilitating their compliance with infection control practices. 18 Ensuring the availability of facemasks and respirators is essential to maximizing compliance. Of the issues raised by participants, the availability of medical masks and respirators was the most frequently identified issue. Participants spoke of inadequate supplies of medical masks and respirators, resulting in staff having to reuse facemasks over 1 or more days. Finally, the use of cloth masks was also reported as routine practice, and in some settings as the sole type provided by the hospital. In some hospitals, reportedly only 3 or 4 new cloth masks are provided to staff each year and it is the HCWs' responsibility to maintain their own supply of facemasks. This situation is of concern, given that previous studies have identified an association between adherence to respiratory protection and the availability of facemasks in hospital settings. 18 The need for HCWs to purchase their own facemasks from local stores was another issue of concern identified by our participants. Generally, facemasks are bought from local stalls or shops that surround the hospital and are manufactured locally. These products may be of inferior quality and may provide a false sense of protection. The ability of facemasks to filter particles varies significantly depending on the materials used for facemask construction. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the sale and marketing of medical devices, including medical masks, and recommends that \"manufacturers demonstrate medical mask performance in 4 areas: fluid resistance, filter efficiency, differential pressure, and flammability\". 20 At present, there are no data on the performance of locally purchased facemasks in these 4 areas. Samples of medical and cloth masks collected from Vietnamese hospitals during a recent survey demonstrated wide variations in filtration performance (data not shown).",

Estimates show that for a pandemic with an approximate estimated duration of 120 days, each HCW would need a total of 480 respirators. This would equate to an estimated cost of $302 per staff member (estimated cost of $0.63 per N95 respirator for products manufactured by a leading international company), or $151,000 per hospital (for 500 physicians/nurses working in high-risk wards/departments). 23 Although these are hypothetical calculations and do not take into account local pricing/discounts, it is unlikely that hospitals in low-resource settings would have the capability of supplying the required quantities of facemasks during a pandemic or extended outbreak.",

Medical masks and respirators have a limited life span. Once worn, they can become damaged or deformed, or develop intolerable levels of breathing resistance from moisture buildup. If worn in an environment with a high probability of exposure to infectious agents, they can become contaminated, especially if worn in a room with any type of aerosol-generating procedure. 24 Commercially available disposable medical masks and respirators are not designed for reuse, and there is nearly universal agreement that reuse, even by a single user, should be discouraged except in the most extreme circumstances.",

The CDC cautiously recommends the extended use and reuse of facemasks in cases of high demand and/or unavailability of masks/respirators, taking into account the severity of infection, transmission mode, spread of disease, and risk of self-contamination. 25 The precise balance between the risk of contact transmission and the benefit of extended use is unknown, although the risk is minimized if HCWs perform hand hygiene before and after touching the respirator.",

The effectiveness of these decontamination measures is uncertain, and no single technique is recommended by either the WHO or the CDC. Any method of decontaminating a facemask must remove the viral threat, be harmless to the user, and should not compromise the integrity of the various elements of the facemask (eg, tear or deform the filter, stretch the elastic attachments, bend the nose clip). 24 More research is needed to ascertain whether any of the methods can be used, given that the material of commercially available medical masks and respirators is not suitable for reuse after standard methods of decontamination. 24 Considering the limited resources in low-and middle-income countries, the issues surrounding the use of cloth masks and extended use and decontamination of facemasks need to be addressed to inform pandemic preparedness. Current guidelines underlying effective control programs have been produced by highincome countries for their own social, economic, and health environments. 6 Low-and middle-income countries might not have the ability to adopt these principles using the same methods and materials. As highlighted by Zimmerman in 2007, there is a need for the development of infection control and prevention guidelines based on evidence but adapted to the specific needs of HCWs in low-resource settings. 26 For example, recent WHO infection control guidelines discuss the level of evidence and also briefly address the use of cloth masks. 4 Further studies are needed to examine the efficacy of various decontamination techniques, and HCWs should be educated about these practices.",

The study also has several limitations, however. Member checking of themes was not undertaken. The fact that focus groups were conducted in Vietnamese language and then translated into English might have jeopardized the interpretation and completeness of data. This was a small study, and the study's qualitative nature restricts the generalizability of our results. Facemask use varies among countries, and a study in one country might not be applicable to rest of the world. Interviews were only undertaken with a select group of participants, so the possibility of other important themes emerging cannot be ruled out. Finally, participants may have overreported compliance with infection control measures to avoid judgment resulting in social desirability bias.",
