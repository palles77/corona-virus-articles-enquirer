Methods: Data from 385 facilities and 562 surveys which were submitted between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2016 were analysed and assessed against an appropriateness assessment guide. The top 10 antimicrobials inappropriately prescribed were determined, both as the total of all antimicrobials and percentage of each prescribed. The top 3 indications with the highest rate of inappropriate prespring were determined. Results: There were 36,502 antimicrobial prescriptions analysed and the top inappropriately prescribed antimicrobial was ceftriaxone with 1123 prescriptions. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the next most inappropriate, with 786 prescriptions, followed by piperacillin-tazobactam, with 575 prescriptions. The antimicrobials with the highest percentage of inappropriate prescribing were cefaclor (58%) Kenacomb (gramicidin-neomycin-nystatin) (56%) and dapsone (50%), although there were only small number of these antimicrobials prescribed, (26, 18 and 2 respectively).

Background: Increased drug resistance is one of the most important issues of global concern, effective way to stop the transmission of drug-resistant strains must have antibiotics stewardship and isolation protection measures, Strains of MRSA were first found in the 1960s there is evidence that concerted efforts that include surveillance cultures, contact precautions and isolation in hospitals can reduce MRSA, but the implementation of isolation measures need to spend the manpower and costs. According to the TNIS System (Taiwan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System) statistics reported that 51% of MRSA detection, so the implementation of the contact for the hospital Isolation is a great burden, so the policy formulation and implementation is the need for many considerations. Methods: Our hospital for the MRSA patients with standard protection. Beginning in 2016 for the first detection of patients to implement contact isolation, cohorting, and the patient after discharge for the final disinfection. For the first isolated of MRSA patient must immediately check the use of antibiotics and related medical behavior, and the unit who isolated of MRSA to the hand hygiene audit, environment cleaning and disinfection of the joint inspection when the patient was discharged. Weekly fixed view of new cases detected distribution trends. Results: The number of new cases isolated by MRSA was reduced from about 120 in 2013 to about 75 in 2016, while DID usage density of antibiotics ( per 1000 bed-day-occupancy) has been declined 30%, the Penicillins have been declined 35%. Conclusion: Through the continuous monitoring of the trend of drug resistance distribution at the same time prudent use of antibiotics and the use of antibiotics stewardship, the most important thing is to implement contact isolation, hand hygiene and medical environment, such as cleaning and disinfection of infection control measures, Reduce the transmission of drugresistant bacteria.",

Methods: From January 2015 to March 2016 rectal swabs of 557 men from 5 institutions undergoing transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsy were obtained. Results: A total of 268 patients had cultures positive for fluoroquinolone resistant bacteria for an overall rate of 48.1%. The incidence of fluoroquinolone resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was 48.1% and 11.8%, respectively. The most common FQ-R bacteria was E. coli (81% of total FQ-R bacteria, 39% of total rectal flora). Univariable and multivariable analysis of clinical parameters affecting FQ-R showed no factor associated with FQ resistance of rectal flora. The clinical parameters associated with infectious complications after prostate biopsy were operation history within 6 months (RR 6.60; 95% CI 1.99-21.8, p = 0.002). Conclusion: Prevalence of FQ-R rectal flora from the rectum before transrectal prostate biopsy was 48.1% and most common FQ-R bacteria was E. coli (39%) However, antibiotic resistance of rectal flora cannot predicted by clinical factors. So Risk based approach cannot recommended and we should consider targeted antibiotic prophylaxis or extended antibiotic prophylaxis.",

The prevalence of antibiotic resistant species is increasing with time. This makes us to spend more money, more time, and more medical resources to fight with them. Diversify the use of antimicrobial agents seems to be effective in reducing the growth of antimicrobial resistance. Methods: Using retrospective study to evaluate the correlation of anti-pseudomonal antibiotic comsumption and antimicrobial resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa by Pearson's correlation coefficient. The data were collected from a regional hospital in middle Taiwan from 2014 to 2016. Antibiotic use was expressed as DDD(defined daily dose) per 1000 patients-days developed by WHO ATC/DDD. Results: During the study, the consumption of Ceftazidime, Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin increased significantly. The consumption of Gentamicin and Amikacin decreased. There was no significant change in the consumption of Imipenem/cilastatin, Cefepime and Piperacillin/tazobactam. Susceptibility rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin and Imipenem/cilastatin were decreases, the others remained stable. The Correlation between antibiotics and their susceptibility was modestly negatively correlated with Ciprofloxacin (r = \u22120.36, p = 0.034) and Piperacillin/tazobactam (r = \u22120.40, p = 0.015). The others, although showed negatively correlated, but p-values (>0.05) were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Our study shows only modestly correlation between anti-pseudomonal antimicrobial usage and pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance. We concluded that the diversity of antibiotic use delayed the antimicrobial resistance development. But with the raising of consumption, susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to each agent is going down. Therefore, keeping antimicrobial stewardship, diversify the use of antibiotics and good infection control will be important strategies to overcome the problems of antibiotic resistance.",

We sought to assess for non-clinical factors associated with antibiotics prescribing in a 1600-bed adult acute-care hospital's emergency department (ED) in Singapore. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 250 consecutive patients who presented with uncomplicated URTI at the ED between May 2016 and Feb 2017. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was instituted and the medical records of the participants accessed for information on antibiotics prescription. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to assess for independent non-clinical factors associated with antibiotics prescribing. Results: Participants had a mean age of 39.4 (SD 14.9) years and tended to be male (64.0%). Almost half (47.2%) had received diplomaand university-level education. 67.6% had no major pre-existing medical conditions. Antibiotics were prescribed for about one-third (35.2%) of the participants, with amoxycillin-clavulanate being the most commonly prescribed antibiotic (72.7%). Although 117 (46.2%) participants reported that they were expecting to receive antibiotics during the ED visit for their illness, only 18.8% informed their physicians about their expectations. Those who expected to receive antibiotics (41.0%) were more likely than those who didn't (30.1%) to be prescribed antibiotics (P = 0.070). Among those who expected antibiotics, there was no difference in the antibiotics prescribing pattern between those who had informed their physicians about their expectations (36.4%) versus those who had not (42.1%) (P = 0.622). After adjusting for age, pre-existing comorbidities, and presenting complaint of fever, expectations for antibiotics (aOR 1.60, 95% CI 0.94-2.72, P = 0.086) and a higher educational level (aOR 1.63, 95% CI 0.94-2.83, P = 0.085) were marginally-significantly associated with antibiotics prescribing. Majority of participants were satisfied with the consultation at the ED, with no difference in satisfaction levels between those who received (90.9%) versus those who did not receive antibiotics (90.7%) (P = 0.965). Conclusion: Patients' higher educational levels and expectations for antibiotics, regardless of whether they were explicitly informed to their physicians, were associated with increased antibiotics prescribing. Further studies are warranted to better understand the influence of non-clinical factors such as these on antibiotic prescribing decision making.",

However, empiric antibiotics have often been prescribed to patients during their ED stay. Previous publications addressed that initial prescriptions applied in ED often be continued in ward. As a result, we compare the differences of initial antibiotic regimens between ED and ward to evaluate whether the empiric antibiotics has been continued in ward. Methods: We conducted retrospective review of medical records within March 1, 2016 to May 31, 2016. Those records belonged to patients of age less than 18, patients who were not admitted and those without any antibiotic as part of treatment were excluded. The initial antibiotics prescribed in ED, the grade of medical staffs who prescribe antibiotics in ward and the initial antibiotic used in ward were recorded. We made judgement as consistence, deescalation or escalation of antibiotics by comparison of initial antibiotic between ED and ward. IBM SPSS version 22 (2013) was used as the statistics software. Results: During the study period, 604 medical records were included and reviewed. The medical staffs who prescribed initial antibiotics in wards consisted of post-grade year one (PGY-1), residents of first to fifth year (R1-R5) and nurse specialists (NP) who made prescriptions under guidance of visiting staffs. The proportion of PGY-1, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 were 14.9%, 35%, 30.9%, 13.9%, 4.8%, 0.7% and 0.8% respectively. Among the antibiotic prescribed in ward, the proportion of consistence, escalation and de-escalation in comparison with ED were 69.7%, 16.9% and 13.2% respectively. In consideration of grades of staffs in wards who applied the same antibiotic as in ED, there were 80.57% of PGY-1, 75% of R4, 70.89% of R2, 69.9% of R1, 60% of R5, 52.27% of NP and 37.93% of R3. The antibiotic ordered by PGY-1 has significantly high coherent rate to ED ( p < 0.05) in comparison with R3, R2, R1 and NP. Conclusion: Antibiotics prescribed in ED, as other medications, had been continued in wards around 80% by junior doctors. As a result, implantation of ASP in ED is important.",

Consequently, particular attention must be paid to broad-spectrum antibiotic prescription, in order to preserve their effectiveness. In our hospital, no recommendation exists for broad-spectrum antibiotic use. The aim of this study was to describe the modalities of broad spectrum antibiotic prescriptions in an infectious diseases department and confront them to the guidelines. Methods: We carried out a professional practice evaluation to assess broad-spectrum antibiotic prescriptions made at the infectious diseases department (Fattouma Bourguiba teaching hospital, Monastir, Tunisia), between January and December 2016. We evaluate 6 broad-spectrum antibiotics: imipenem, ertapenem, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycoside, tigecycline and colimycin. Evaluation was done by two infectious disease specialist based on national and international guidelines. Results: Ninety eight prescriptions were included for 95 patients. The mean age was 53 years (14-84 years). Sex ratio was 0.86. Broadspectrum antibiotics were mostly used for skin infections in 41 cases (41.8%) and urinary tract infection in 33 cases (33.7%). It was community acquired infections in 90 cases (91.8%) and nosocomial infections in 8 cases (8.2%). Antibiotic combinations were used in 68 cases (69.4%). The broad-spectrum antibiotic was first line prescribed in 58 (59.2%). Prescriptions were documented only in 24 cases (24.58%). Extended-spectrum betalactamase producing Escherichia coli was isolated in 7 cases (25.9%). Fluoroquinolones were used in 64 cases (65.3%), imipenem in 15 cases (15.3%), aminoglycoside in 8 cases (8.1%), colimycin in 6 cases (6.1%), tigecycline in 2 cases (2%) and ertapenem in 1 case (1%). Broadspectrum antibiotic usage was judged adequate in 65 cases (66.3%). Otherwise, antibiotic duration was adequate in 89 cases (90.9%), posology in 97 cases (99%) and the use antibiotic combinations in 40 cases (57.1%). Twenty-six cases (26.8%) of the initial prescriptions seemed to be adapted to the identified bacteria. Conclusion: In our department, global evaluation showed that more than third of prescriptions were inadequate. Moreover, broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed in communityacquired infections in more than 90% of cases. In order to improve the quality of broad-spectrum prescriptions, standardized protocols must be implemented, supervised by an antibiotic stewardship team. study was to evaluate the stability of daptomycin in serum at various temperatures. Methods: Daptomycin serum samples were prepared and stored long-term in a refrigerator (4\u00b0C) or in freezers (\u221280\u00b0C and \u221220\u00b0C), as well as at assumed body temperatures (35\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, and 39\u00b0C). The stability of daptomycin under various conditions was evaluated by repeatedly measuring concentrations. Results: Although the decrease of daptomycin concentration in serum samples stored in freezers was less than 10% after 168 days (6 months), the concentrations in samples stored in a refrigerator decreased by more than 70% over the same period. Furthermore, daptomycin concentrations in serum samples stored at close to body temperature decreased by more than 50% after only 24 h ( Figure 1 ). The rate of daptomycin elimination from serum samples increased with the rise of temperature, especially under conditions that assumed living body. ",

The essential information, included patient profile, predicted PK parameters, and measured concentrations, was documented in a fixed format. We retrospectively collected all the records from Jan. 2016 to May 2017. The definition of obesity is body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m2. All adults (\u226518 years old) with at least 1 measured steady state trough levels were included. During treatment period, patients who had acute kidney injury, serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL, dialysis, concomitant use of mannitol, or missing data were excluded. To measure the performance of this dosing calculator in obese patients, the percentage of patients whose predicted Ctrough was within 2.5 and 5.0 mg/L from measured Ctrough were calculated. Results: Overall, 69 obese patients were included. Sixty-two percent of obese patients whose trough concentration fell into the range of 10 to 20 mg/L after initial dosing. The mean dose per kg for those who achieved the levels of 10-20 was significantly lower in obese patients (9.7 mg/kg Q8H and 11.0 mg/kg Q12H). Comparing the difference between predicted and measured concentrations, 35.2% of obese patients had the predicted concentrations that are within 2.5 mg/L from measured concentrations; 66.2% had the predicted concentrations that are within 5.0 mg/L from measured concentrations. Conclusion: Lower dose per kg was needed to achieve therapeutic range in obese patients which may imply the PK change of vancomycin clearance doesn't correlate linearly with total body weight. Therefore, when empirically giving the guideline recommended initial dose of 30-45 mg/kg/day, lower daily dose per kg might be considered for obese patients. The performance of our calculator in obese patients was well comparable to that in nonobese patients. and epidermal lesion due to toxidermia in all cases.

School of Pharmacy, Shujitsu University Background: Cytochromes P450 (CYP) are a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous chemicals. Although CYP2C subfamilies (CYP2C8/9/19) share more than 82% amino acid sequence identity, they have rather distinct substrate specificities. Piperacillin, a penicillin-based antibiotic, is partially metabolized by CYP2C8. CYP3A4 is the predominant form expressed in the human liver and intestine, whereas CYP3A5 is expressed polymorphically. Azole antifungals inhibit CYPs including CYP3A4, and macrolide-based antibiotics exhibit mechanism-based inhibition against CYP3A4. However, there have been a few reports describing the effect of these antimicrobials and antifungals on human drugmetabolizing CYP activities. Methods: CYP2C8/9/19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli (Bactosomes) were obtained from Cypex Ltd. Aminopyrine N-demethylation, tolbutamide hydroxylation, dopamine formation from p-tyramine, and testosterone 6\u03b2hydroxlation activities were determined as reported previously. Results: Inhibition of amoxicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin at 0.5 or 1 mM concentration was not observed for CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, however, amoxicillin and piperacillin inhibited CYP2C8-mediated aminopyrine N-demethylation at 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 0.83 and 1.14 mM, respectively. The predicted free fractions of the maximum inflow concentration of the inhibitors into the liver calculated with reported pharmacokinetic parameters are much lower than the concentration investigated in this study and estimated IC 50 values for CYP2C8. Although fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole at a concentration of 2 or 10 \u00b5M neither inhibited nor stimulated CYP2C8mediated aminopyrine N-demethylation activity, ketoconazole and miconazole noncompetitively inhibited CYP2C8-mediated aminopyrine N-demethylation with the inhibitory constant values of 1.98 and 0.86 \u00b5M, respectively. Erythromycin inhibited CYP3A4mediated testosterone 6\u03b2-hydroxylation preincubation-timedependently but had little influence on the CYP3A5-mediated metabolic activity. Conclusion: The interactions between these three penicillin-based antibiotics and other drugs that are metabolized by CYPs investigated would not be clinically significant. Ketoconazole and miconazole might inhibit CYP2C8 in addition to other CYPs clinically.",

Novel targets or mechanisms of action against multidrug resistance are needed to avoid the preexisting antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and serves as a permeability barrier that protects the bacterium from many antibiotics. For most GNB, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae, the inability to synthesize the LPS has a bactericidal effect. And thus the interference of LPS assembly by a small molecule inhibitor would result in antibacterial activity. The UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC), encoded by lpxC, is an essential enzyme that controls the first committed step in LPS biosynthesis in Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, there is no counterpart enzyme in human. Methods: Through computer-aid drug design and rational drug design, TaiGen has discovered a proprietary series of selective potent LpxC inhibitors. Results: In this report, we demonstrated a novel class of LpxC inhibitors showed good and equal potencies against P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia and E. coli in bacterial growth inhibition assay (MIC: <1 ug/mL) and reduced LPS biosynthesis (LpxC enzyme assays IC: <50 nM) significantly.",

This study determined the in vitro killing activity of tedizolid and linezolid against recent clinical strains isolated from patients in China. Methods: Time-kill curves were generated for recent clinical isolates of MRSA, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [PRSP] , and linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis [LREF] , using also ATCC control strains. Bacterial cultures (inoculated at approximately 1 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mL) were grown at 35\u00b0C in the appropriate liquid medium for up to 24 hours. Tedizolid and linezolid were added to cultures at baseline, at clinically relevant concentrations based upon standard dosage for humans (200 mg once-daily and 600 mg twice-daily respectively), and also based upon recent minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data. Samples were removed at fixed time points, plated onto standard culture medium and then incubated at 35\u00b0C for 18 hours. Curves were plotted using the colony counting method, based on CLSI Guideline M26. Results: Key data are displayed in the table. The control and clinical strains were susceptible to both drugs, except a linezolid-resistant E. faecalis clinical strain had an MIC = 8 \u00b5g/mL. Tedizolid and linezolid displayed notable bactericidal effects against PRSP and bacteriostatic inhibitory effect against MRSA at clinically relevant concentrations. Against LREF, both drugs exerted an inhibitory effect independent of concentration. Conclusion: Tedizolid exerted a greater bactericidal effect than linezolid against streptococcal species in vitro and exerted a bacteriostatic against MRSA and LREF. Background: During the last decade, colistin ( polymyxin E) has been used as the last line defense against infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens. Unfortunately, the re-use of this drug has been obviously followed by the emergence of colistin resistance, mediated by chromosomic gene mutations into pmrA/ pmrB, phoP/PhoQ, ccrA/ccrB, lpxA, lpxC, lpxD, and mgrB. These mutations induce a complex gene regulation cascade leading to the synthesis and addition of the 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) to lipid A of the membrane inducing therefore the colistin resistance. However, in 2015, it has been described for the first time, a plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-1. Nowadays, a worldwide dissemination of mcr-1 has been reported. Here, using a phylogeny approach, we investigate the mcr-1 gene origin.",

They are identified into several Enterobacteriaceae and Gramnegative bacteria. Mcr-1 gene is shared by all plasmids and located into a transposon (3'442-bp; 46 .34%GC) composed by an insertion sequence ISApl1, mcr-1, and a sulfatase encoding gene, pap2. The blastP analysis reveals a total of 9'025 homologous sequences to MCR-1. The phylogenetic analysis of these sequences reveals a huge number of phosphoethanolamine transferases within the Campylobacter genus. Moreover, this analysis reveals that the most closely related homologous sequences to MCR-1 were those identified in Moraxella species, with high similarity (\u226598%). This finding was confirmed by a \"Rhizome\" analysis of MCR-1 which clearly shows that this latter is a chimeric sequence from Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella pluranimalium, and Psychrobacter urativorans and the most part of the gene was from M. pluranimalium.

Background: For several years, facing, colistin has been used as the last line antimicrobial drug for the treatment of multi-drug resistant Gram negative bacteria infections. Unfortunately, the renewed interest for this antimicrobial peptide led to the emergence of acquired resistance especially in Enterobacteriaceae, but also the increase of infections due to intrinsic colistin-resistant bacteria. Mechanisms of resistance to colistin are complex and misunderstood, particularly in these bacteria. While all Proteus bacteria are naturally resistant to colistin, we were surprised to recently isolate a P. vulgaris clinical strain susceptible to colistin, and we propose in this work to understand the molecular support of colistin resistance in this species by a comparative genomic and phenotypic approach. Methods: Genomes of P. vulgaris susceptible strain CSUR P1868_S and a resistant one CSUR P1867_R were sequenced and compared to select groups of interesting genes that were absent, truncated or mutated in the susceptible strain. Among the group of mutated genes, we selected those that were already known to be putatively involved in antimicrobial peptide resistance and we realized a SIFT score to predict the probability mutation could alter protein function. Use of electronic microscopy and lipid A analysis by mass spectrometry after lipid A extraction help us to understand pathways involved in colistin susceptibility/resistance. Results: Genome of CSUR P1868_S was 4.28 Mb in length with a GC content of 37.8% whereas CSUR P1867_R genome was 3.9 Mb and 38.1%. It contained numerous resistant genes particularly against aminosides, \u03b2-lactamines, fluoroquinolones, and cotrimoxazole, carried by various plasmids. We found significant difference in outer membrane glycoside structures in the susceptible and resistant strains, and this was corroborated by MALDI-TOF analysis, which showed the absence of 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) in outer membrane lipid A moiety of the susceptible strain. Comparative genomic analysis with others resistant strains of Proteus vulgaris available in local database found mutation in arnBCADTEF operon of studied susceptible strain. Transcriptomic analysis of genes belonging to arnBCADTEF operon showed significant decrease in mRNA expression level of tested genes in the susceptible strain, supporting that addition L-Ara4N in the outer membrane of lipid A moiety can explain the increase in colistin susceptibility. Finally, the insertion of the arnD gene in the susceptible strain led to a 32 folds increase of colistin MIC, showing the role of this gene in Proteus vulgaris colistin resistance. Conclusion: We showed that the arnD gene of the arn operon was mutated in the susceptible P. vulgaris. It is known that sugars fixation on lipid A is a key pathway for polymyxin resistance. However, it is certainly not the only one because lots of enigmas on colistin resistance remain. Other genes that were absent in the susceptible strain could be linked to colistin resistance including a whole operon involved in sialic acid metabolism. We are currently developing knock-out techniques to study these different hypothetical targets and to discover new pathways involved in colistin resistance. Bacterial defense system and antimicrobial peptides coexist for a long time, and mechanisms of resistance to colistin are complex and implied a lot of genes. This is the first report that describes genomic differences between this particular susceptible strain and a typical P. vulgaris opening new research pathway to understand colistin resistance.",

Long-term, low-dose macrolide treatment has markedly increased 5-year survival rate of patients with DPB. Consequently, researchers are interested in using macrolides such as erythromycin and clarithromycin that not included in the anti-pseudomonal therapeutic weapon because of the absence of bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that macrolides influence P. aeruginosa virulence. However, most studies evaluated the regulatory effects of macrolides on P. aeruginosa virulence factors after treatment over a short period (<48 hours). In this study, we subcultured P. aeruginosa for two years in the presence of low-dose macrolides, and evaluated virulence factors such as total protease, elastase, and pyocyanin. In addition, the effect of macrolide exposure strain on A549 cell was investigated. Methods: P. aeruginosa PAO1 was repeatedly subcultured 104 times over two years on Mueller-Hinton agar containing 1.6 \u03bcg/mL erythromycin or 0.8 \u03bcg/mL clarithromycin. The macrolide concentration was determined by referencing the maximum drug concentration (Cmax) at the time of oral administration. Strains that subcultured in the presence of low-dose macrolides were frozen at 2 month intervals. Macrolide exposure strains were used to examine the time-dependent change of total protease, elastase, pyocyanin and A549 cell survival rate.",

In recent years, multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae (MDRKP) is rapidly increasing because of antibiotics overuse and it has been implicated in a variety of nosocomial infections. MDRKP cause a problem in the clinical treatment of patients and some references demonstrate that antibody-immune response is essential for host defense against bacterial pathogens. In this study, we've developed a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of MDRKP. DCB's human single B cell antibody discovery platform allows screening of single cells to rapidly isolate and sequence fifty of antibodies with known binding specificity or functional properties. Methods: Fully Human Monoclonal Antibodies from Single Peripheral Blood B Cell Using K. pneumoniae (KP) as a sorting model, we established a platform technology that can obtain human mAbs against KP directly from each single human plasma or memory B cell by cloning the VH and VL variable regions. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from human whole blood, and KPspecific single memory B cells were sorted into 96-well PCR plates by fluorescence-activating cell sorter. The antibody genes of these single cells were then amplified by RT-PCR, and expressed by FreeStyle 293 expression system. Opsonophagocytic killing assay (OPK assay) The target K. pneumoniae was grown in TSB. HL-60 cells was differentiation by DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide). For the OPK assay, contains 1 \u00d7 10 3 CFUs of bacteria, antibody, 4 \u00d7 10 5 differentiated HL60 cells and complement. The reaction was plating on TSA plate incubate for overnight at 37\u00b0C, then count colonies and analyze data. Conclusion: We demonstrate an established platform, which generates a panel of human monoclonal antibodies from human PBMCs. Twenty-five antibodies clones were selected high affinity with K. pneumoniae in single B cell technology. The average KD value is up to 10 \u221210 . In vitro opsonophagocytic assays demonstrate that twenty anti-KP antibodies can increase the antibody-mediated phagocytosis in K. pneumoniae. Our results suggest that the selected antibodies can be potential lead drugs for further testing in a K. pneumoniae infection animal model. The recombinant Abs might play a crucial role in treatment of MDR-KP infection.",

BITC treatment also inhibited MDR E coli growth, this inhibition could be reversed by adding thiol reducing agents including N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), L-Glutathione (GSH), Dithiothreitol (DTT) and 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) to the culture medium. Background: Economic pressures and legal constraints increasingly force hospital pharmacies to purchase generic drugs rather than original branded products. Yet, differences in key properties have been noted between suppliers of antibiotics with the same denomination (INN), even if all approved by local health authorities. This has raised concerns among clinicians about drug quality when dealing with patients in critical conditions such as in Intensive Care Units where ease of preparation, efficacy, and stability of the prescribed antibiotics are of paramount importance. Methods: We compared (i) the rate of dissolution (by experienced nurses), (ii) the coloring (spectrophotometry) and degradation (LC-MS-MS) over ward storage of the original meropenem (MERONEM \u00ae ; AstraZeneca) vs. 4 generics of meropenem authorized in Belgium, France and/or Spain (Sandoz, Hospira, Fresenius-Kabi, Aurovit).

To this end, the potential crosstalk between H. pylori (Hp) infected gastric stromal cells (Hp-GSCs) and DCs were investigated. Methods: The expression of IL-23 and IL-17 indicative activation of DCs and Th17 cells, respectively, was evaluated as the primary experimental readouts. Primary CD90 + GSCs from cancerous and adjacent normal tissues were generated from gastric cancer patients, and monocyte-derived DCs were obtained from healthy individuals. Levels of cytokines and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) were measured by ELISA, and C-type lectin expression in GSCs was assessed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Results: In a trans-well co-culture system, significantly upregulated DC-derived IL-23 expression was found when DCs were cocultured with Hp-infected GSCs (Hp-GSCs). Further, PGE 2 from Hp-GSCs was discovered to possess the priming effect, which could be inhibited, by anti-COLEC12 (Collectin subfamily member 12) blocking Abs, COLEC12 knockdown or when alpha3-fucosyltransferase-null ( futB; HP0651) strain of Hp was used. Also, the expression of COLEC12 was co-localized with CD90 + stromal cells in cancerous tissues. Furthermore, Hp-GSCs-conditioned DCs were able to induce the expression of IL-17 from CD4 + T cells, which could be inhibited by IL-23-neutralizing Abs. Conclusion: These results suggested the importance of COLEC12 as a receptor involved in Hp-stromal cell interaction and its subsequent conditioning effect on DCs.",

Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C Background: Molecular chaperone plays an important role to assist folding and assembling of nascent polypeptides, preventing protein misfolding and aggregation which were damaged by temperature, pH and osmotic stresses. DnaK belong to the heat shock protein 70 of molecular chaperone and cooperates with cochaperone DnaJ and nucleotide exchange factor GrpE. ATP is required for DnaK to active and remodel their substrate client protein. Although it was generally recognized that the molecular chaperone DnaK system is highly conserved within the Three Domains of life, investigation on the molecular chaperone system in Archaea are limited. Genes related with molecular chaperone in halophilic methanogen Methanohalophilus portucalensis FDF1 T were analyzed and the dnak, dnaJ and grpE genes are induced by the heat and salt stresses. Moreover, our phosphoproteomic analysis in strain FDF1 T indicated that there are four phosphorylated sites in DnaK (Wu et al., 2016) . Methods: The phosphorylated sites of MpDnaK were mutated to alanine as the dephospho-mimic state and also to aspartic acid as the phospho-mimic state with the site-directed mutagenesis method by PCR. The overexpression of wild type and mutants MpDnaK were induced by IPTG in E. coli DE3(RIL)BL21 and were further purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The ATPase activities of MpDnaK was measured by colorimetric assay for inorganic phosphate. The structure modeling of MpDnaK was constructed by Easy modeler with highest identity species as template. Results: The ATPase kinetic assay revealed that substrate ATP hydrolytic velocity in phospho-mimic type MpDnaK was similar with the wild-type which suggested that the phosphorylation on Ser518 did not affect the ATP hydrolytic activity. Further structure modeling analysis revealed the phosphorylated Ser518 is located in the lid domain of MpDnaK which relate to the open/close of the substrate binding pocket and initiate/terminate the disaggregation process. Distance measurement within the wild type Ser518, dephosphomimic Ser518A and phosphomimic Ser518D to the substrate binding pocket residue Arg414 showed that after phosphorylation on Ser518, the distance are the shortest (1.8 \u00c5). The shorter distance may contribute more stable conformation for lid closing and promote more efficient disaggregation process. This analytical result suggest that post-translational phosphorylation may involve the regulation of the substrate binding and disaggregation. Conclusion: The phosphorylation on Ser518 did not affect the ATP hydrolytic activity of MpDnaK, whereas the PTM-phosphorylation on lid domain-Ser518 promote the lid-substrate binding pocket interaction, which may further enhance the refolding activity.",

Moreover, UPS inhibitors are demonstrated to attenuate the progression of neural degenerative diseases. UPS is a versatile complex composed of multiple subunits. Proteolytic function of UPS is involvoed in diverse and important biochemical pathways in cell. Therapeutic prospect of UPS inhibitor is promising and valuable. We aimed to establish a high-content image-based drug screening assay directing UPS. Our natural compounds are purifed from Formosan soft corals with distinctive structure elucidated. Methods: Human cytomegalovirus UL76 interacts with proteasome regulatory subunits of 26S proteasome. In HEK293T cells, the transient-expressing EGFP-UL76 fusion protein exhibits distinct nuclear aggresome. Fluorescence intensities and the phenotypic behaviors of UL76-aggresome are used as markers for proteasome inhbition. The image acquisition is accomplished using ImageXpress Micro widefield high-content screening system (Molecular Device). The imagng data were analyzed by MetaXpress software package. Proteasome inhibitors, Bortezomib, MG132, and clasto-lactacystin \u03b2-lactone are used as paradigm control to validate the screening efficacy Results: The phenotypic behaviors and intensity profiles of UL76aggresome are responsive to the treatment of the three known proteasome inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. This cellbased high-content screening system is established and employed in search of proteasome inhibitors from marine natural products. One hundred and forty structural elucidated natural products were assessed. Among them, three groups of structural disctinct groups purified from Formosan soft corals were shown with inhibitory activity for proteasome. Conclusion: We established an efficient high-content system for screening UPS inhibitor. waste water.

This experiment using SDB as basic medium, carbon source respectively sawdust and starch, and adding calcium sulfate 0.5 g and calcium carbon 1 g in the medium was the best, tolerance test of white rot fungi. We also study the influence of removing heavy metals in different pH, culture period, calcium ion, anion and common metal. The experiment of adding calcium in this test, calcium ion in the liquid culture that can promote the degradation of white rot fungus of heavy metals, especially for copper ion and lead ion, copper ion degradation in the concentration of 10 ppm to 1 ppm and lead ion degradation in the concentration of 20 ppm to 1.5 ppm, then explore the degradation ability of zinc, copper, mercury, lead, all have good results, but only the zinc ions in the zinc copper exception. The ion in the mixed solution, zinc ions can be degraded by this strain. Experiment that starch medium than in sawdust medium, can provide more nutrients, prompting the white rot fungi to produce catalase, may be because in adversity, this strain can secrete more peroxide dismutase to help themselves to resist adversity and sawdust medium, Although the activity of SOD in sawdust medium was low, the degradation rate was better, and it could buffer the pH value of polar acid, and stable and sustained supply of nutrients.",

Department of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Tzu-Chi University, Hualien 97004, Taiwan Background: Klebsiella pneumoniae, an important opportunistic pathogen in nosocomial infection, usually causes urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) in human. K. pneumoniae produces many virulence factors that contribute to pathogenicity in humans. Bacterial biofilm represents a key virulence determinant in promoting bacterial persistence and resistance to antibiotics. The ability of bacterial adherence to biotic or abiotic substrate is an essential step for biofilm formation. Such adherence can be mediated by bacterial fimbriae, which are also important virulence factors in many bacteria. In enterobacteria, cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) plays a vital role as a global regulator. CRP protein regulates several essential bacterial virulence gene expression, including fimbriae and biofilm formation, responsing to intracellular concentration of cAMP. It is reported that CRP-cAMP complex regulates type 1 fimbriation in Escherichia coli.

Many regulatory mechanisms have been evolved for bacteria to adapt to changes of diverse environments. Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are known to contribute to bacterial pathogenicity by exerting toxic effects on host cells or competing bacterial species and are involved in a broad variety of functions such as biofilm formation and stress sensing. This large array of functions is reflected by a diversity of regulatory mechanisms. The regulation of P. mirabilis T6SS remains unclear. Recently, our transcriptome analysis revealed P. mirabilis T6SS was regulated by a global regulator Crp. Methods: We first confirmed the regulation of T6SS by Crp using real-time RT-PCR and the promoter reporter assay and identified one T6SS main structure operon and four Hcp/VgrG effector operons by using sequence specific RT and then PCR. We investigated whether Crp can bind directly to T6SS promoter region using a DNaseI footprinting assy. Overexpression of the effector toxin was performed to disclose its function. The growth predominance test and killing assay were used to observe the competition between wild type and crp mutant. We contructed vipAB (encoding the T6SS sheath) mutant to confirm the Crpregulated killing of T6SS. We also purified the possible toxin to assess its function in killing of E. coli. Results: Crp positively regulated T6SS by binding directly to T6SS promoter region and also positively regulated the expression of the effector toxins. Overexpression of the effector toxin in wild-type P. mirabili resulted in killing of both crp mutant and E. coli. Accordingly, the growth predominance test and killing assay demonstrated that P. mirabilis T6SS conferred growth predominance on the wild-type over both crp mutant and E. coli. Conclusion: Crp positively regulated the expression of P. mirabilis T6SS and affected its killing function. T6SS contributed to growth predominance over crp mutant and E. coli, suggesting P. mirabilis T6SS as an antibacterial weapon.",

Background: The antimicrobial peptide, epinecidin-1 (Epi), was identified from Epinephelus coioides and may have clinical application for treating sepsis. Epi has been shown to ameliorate antibiotic-resistant bacteria-induced sepsis in mice, but further evaluation in mixed-flora models and a description of the protective mechanisms are essential to establish this peptide as a potential therapeutic. Methods: Therefore, we first tested the protective effects of Epi against polymicrobial sepsis-induced bactericidal infection, inflammation and lung injury that result from cecal ligation and puncture in mice. Furthermore, since lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a key inducer of inflammation during bacterial infection and sepsis, we also tested the LPS-antagonizing activity and related mechanisms of Epi-mediated protection in mice with LPSinduced endotoxemia and LPS-treated Raw264.7 mouse macrophage cells. Results: Epi rescued mice from both polymicrobial sepsis and endotoxemia after delayed administration and suppressed both lung and systemic inflammatory responses, while attenuating lung injury and diminishing bacterial load. In vitro studies revealed that Epi suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production. Mechanistically, Epi disrupted the interaction between LPS and LPS binding protein, competed with LPS for binding on the cell surface, and inhibited Toll-like receptor 4 endocytosis, resulting in inhibition of LPS-induced reactive oxygen species/p38/Akt/NF-\u03baB signaling and subsequent cytokine production. Conclusion: Overall, our results demonstrate that Epi is a promising therapeutic agent for endotoxemia and polymicrobial sepsis.",

The primary endpoint was to compare the clinical response to cefoperazone/sulbactam with cefepime at the test of cure (TOC) visit evaluated within 7-21 days after last dose. Secondary endpoints were overall survival and objective response in all patients assessed by intention-to-treat (ITT). During the study period, all subjects who received at least one dose of study drugs were included in the safety population and monitored for safety issues. Results: From Sep. 22, 2009 to Aug 06, 2012, a total of 174 subjects in 12 hospitals were screened, A total of 147 subjects were included in the evaluable population. The clinical response rate at TOC visit was 81.8% (54/66) in the cefoperazone/sulbactam group, while it was 79.0% (64/81) in the cefepime group. In the ITT population, the clinical response rates were 82.1% (55/67) in the cefoperazone/sulbactam group, and 79.0% (64/81) in the cefepime group. Non-inferiority of cefoperazone/sulbactam to cefepime was demonstrated in both populations with a noninferiority margin at 20% ( p-value <0.001). Thirty-five adverse events were judged as related to study medications. No statistically significant difference regarding adverse events was observed between the two groups. Conclusion: This study indicated that the combination of cefoperazone/sulbactam was not inferior to cefepime when used to treat patients with HAP/HCAP. All the reported serious adverse events were not related to study drugs, and the incidences of adverse drug reactions were low. Therefore, cefoperazone/sulbactam (2g/2g every 12 hours) was tolerable and effective to treat patients with HAP/HCAP.",

However, there have been only a few reports about the influence on risk and prognosis factors of IPD. Methods: 37 cases of pneumococcal isolation from two sets of blood cultures in Nagasaki Medical Center from April 2009 to March 2016 were designated as IPD. We compared the IPD cases with 49 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia without isolation from blood cultures about the risk and prognostic factors. We defined pneumococcal pneumonia in which pneumococci were isolated in sputum culture or urine antigen test was positive, in addition to respiratory symptom such as fever, cough, sputum, and dyspnea, elevated inflammatory response and chest abnormal shadow. Comparative study was done backwardly about the underlying disease, blood test, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score, antibiotics regimen and prognosis. Results: Pneumonia rate in adult IPD was 62.2%, and the mortality rate of the cases was 16.2%. In the IPD group, there was a tendency to select broad-spectrum antimicrobials as an initial treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia. In the multivariate analysis, several independent risk factors of IPD, including malignant tumors [odds ratio (OR), 19.60; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.58-84.04; p = 0.0001], and initial qSOFA (OR, 19.90; 95% CI, ; p = 0.0009), were associated with IPD. Initial qSOFA (OR, 5.60; 95% CI, 1.14-27.13; p = 0.0343) was also elucidated as a prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion: High initial qSOFA could be a risk and prognostic factor of IPD. We might suspect IPD earlier by using qSOFA and lead to the improvement of prognosis, because qSOFA was extremely easy scoring on bedside. Background: Anaerobes are rare causes of spinal infections and constitute less than 4% of all cases. Methods: In this report, we presented a case with Parvimonas micra, a gram-positive anaerobic coccus, spinal infection. We also searched the PubMed database using the terms \"spondylodiscitis,\" \"discitis,\" \"spondylitis,\" \"osteomyelitis,\" \"spinal,\" \"vertebral,\" \"Peptostreptococcus,\" \"Micromonas,\" \"Parvimonas\" to find similar cases in English literature. The clinical information of all cases, including ours, was extracted and analyzed using SPSS 18 software. Results: Totally, 14 additional cases with P. micra spinal infection were found in English literature. Table 1 shows the demographic data, co-morbidities, and outcomes of patients with P. micra spinal infection. The median age of these patients was 70 years. Over half of the patients were male and nearly half of all cases (46.7%) had dental problems or a prior history of dental work. Back pain (80%), but not fever, was the most common symptom and the median duration of symptom was 6 weeks. Thoracic and lumbar vetebrae were the most commly involved sites. Increased values of inflammation markers were recorded in all cases. Five cases (33.3%) received surgical intervention. The median duration of antimicrobial treatment was 8 weeks and all but one case were cured without clinical relapse.

We report refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to Aspergillus pneumonia in a patient with influenza A infection. Methods: A 56-year-old man of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and old cerebrovascular accident suffered from dyspnea for days. He was brought to emergency department on February 20, 2016. Laboratory data revealed WBC, 5200/\u03bcL; platelet count, 22,800/\u03bcL; procalcitonin, 19.89 ng/ml; lactate, 5.8 mmole/L; and creatinine, 0.68 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas showed pH, 7.29; PCO 2 , 44.5 mmHg; PO 2 , 80 mmHg; HCO 3 , 21.1 mmol/L; Base excess, \u22125.1 mmol/L; FiO 2 , 65%; and P/F ratio, 123 mmHg. Real Time PCR for FluA showed positive. Antimicrobial therapy included oseltamivir, tamiflu, levofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. CXR showed diffuse mixed interstitial and alveolar infiltration over bilateral lungs, suspicious of pneumonia. He was intubated and then was admitted to intensive care unit. Initial hemodynamic support with fluid resuscitation and infusion of vasopressor were administered. ARDS occurred with persistent hypoxemia and inhaled nitric oxide therapy on February 25. Aspergillus antigen index was high (>4.43). Intravenous voriconazole was used on February 26. However, spiking fever was noted. Sputum culture yielded Acinetobacter baumannii and Eenterobacter aerogenes. We adjusted antibiotic therapy to imipenem/cilastatin and teicoplanin. Results: After aggressive treatment, poor prognosis was informed to his families about the limit of medical treatment. The patient was critically discharged on March 14, 2016. Conclusion: IPA may complicate influenza pneumonia in a previously healthy adult. Early diagnosis and treatment of Aspergillus infection complicating influenza is mandatory as high mortality. Given the rapid symptom-onset and deterioration, the clinician must be vigilant in promptly diagnosing and treating influenza-like illness. Antibiotics for bacterial co-infection and antifungal therapy should be considered. Finally, corticosteroids in patients with influenza may pose a risk for invasive fungal infections.",

When presented to our ER, physical examination revealed bilaterally enlarged tonsils without exudates, and right lower lung crackles; the rest of his physical findings are otherwise unremarkable. Lab showed neutropenia, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury. A chest computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed a right lower lung consolidation, suggesting pneumonia. We thus treated him with intravenous moxifloxacin empirically upon admission. Results: Despite promptly starting antibiotics, intermittent fevers and progressive dyspnea persisted. Blood culture grew anaerobes in preliminary reports on hospital day 3. We shifted his antibiotics to intravenous imipenem. However, his dyspnea and fevers did not resolve after switching to imipenem, and a follow-up CT scan on the hospital day 5 showed a worsening bilateral pneumonia. His final blood culture report yielded Fusobacterium nucleatum. An ambulatory ultrasonography examination of the persistently painful right neck revealed an intravascular mass in right internal jugular vein, suggestive of thrombosis. The diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome was made. He was intubated on hospital day 6, and was added ampicillin/sulbactam in addition to imipenem. A neck CT scan on hospital day 8 (Figure 1 ) clearly demonstrated his right internal jugular vein thrombosis, along with surrounding fat tissue stranding. Right internal jugular vein ligation was performed on hospital day 10. He was successfully extubated after the surgery, and had no more fevers. He was transferred to the general ward on hospital day 11. We then de-escalated his antibiotics to ampicillin/sulbactam. The subsequent clinical course was smooth, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 24. Conclusion: Leimerre syndrome has decreased in incidence and been described as \"the forgotten syndrome\" as antibiotics advances. In a young patient with acute pharyngitis accompanied with signs of septic embolization, Lemierre syndrome should always be considered. Background: Mycoplasma hominis, a well known cause of neonatal infection, has been reported as a pathogen in urogenital infections in adults; however, central nervous system (CNS) infections are rare. We report here the first case of M. hominis meningitis in China, post neurosurgical treatment for an intracerebral haemorrhage in a 79-year-old male. Case presentation: We describe a 79-year-old who developed M. hominis meningitis after neurosurgical treatment and was successfully treated with combined azithromycin and minocycline therapy of two weeks' duration, despite delayed treatment because the Gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) yielded no visible organisms. The diagnosis required 16S rDNA sequencing analysis of the cultured isolate from CSF. Literature review of M. hominis CNS infections yielded 16 cases (13 instances of brain abscess and 3 of meningitis). Delay in diagnosis and initial treatment failure was evident in all cases. With appropriate microbiological testing, antibiotic therapy (ranging from 5 days to 12 weeks) and often, multiple surgical interventions, almost all the patients improved immediately. Conclusion: Both our patient findings and the literature review, highlighted the pathogenic potential of M. hominis together with the challenges prompted by rare infectious diseases in particular for developing countries labs with limited diagnostic resources.",

Background: Fungi of the order Mucorales are ubiquitous in nature but rarely cause human infection. However, because of the rising amount of immunocompromised patients, the incidence of invasive fungal infection also increased. There was only one case report of pleural empyema related to mucormycosis to date. Here we report the first case in Taiwan and review the literature of the previous reports. Methods: A 54-year-old man with a history of end stage diabetic nephropathy presented to our hospital 35 days after receiving kidney transplantation, complaining progressive dyspnea and pleuritic right chest pain for 5 days. The initial laboratory data showed leukocytosis (WBC 16,200 cells/micro liter) and chest plain film showed right side ill-defined opacity with pleural effusion. Broad-spectrum antibiotic was initiated but the clinical improvement was limited. The pleural effusion Gram's stain and further analysis yielded mold of Rhizopus species. Results: Pig-tail was inserted for pleural effusion drainage, and we started Liposomal Amphotericin B for mold of Rhizopus species. Fever subsided and the respiratory condition also improved. The pig-tail was removed 40 days later when the drainage amount decreased to 30 ml. Liposomal Amphotericin B was discontinued after 25 days of therapy, and was shifted to oral Posaconazole for maintenance. Currently the patient is doing well and received regular follow-up in our outpatient clinic.",

Department of Pharmacy, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) consists of a group of hematopoietic neoplasms. The treatment includes induction chemotherapy, consolidation chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Induction chemotherapy induces severe neutropenia and such immunocompromised patients often become septic shock because of infection. Some clinicians prescribe posaconazole to prevent invasive fungal infection before induction chemotherapy. We want to analyze the posaconazole prevention for acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving induction chemotherapy-induced invasive fungal infection. Method: This is a retrospective study. Patients were diagnosed AML and received induction chemotherapy from 2014 to 2017 at a medical center in southern Taiwan are included. We compare the incidence of invasive fungal infection, the period of neutropenia and the survival rate between two groups, one group consist of patients with posaconazole prevention and the other group consist of patients without posaconazole prevention. Results: There were 25 patients included for analysis. There were 18 patients received posaconazole prevention and 7 patients didn't. The incidence of invasive fungal infection is both 0% in two groups and the period of neutropenia in the prevention group is 17.4 days and 16.1 days in the group without prevention. The survival rate is 59% in the prevention group and 100% in the group without prevention. Conclusion: This retrospective analysis reveals that the incidence of invasive fungal infection and the survival rate show no statistically significant difference between two groups. The one month cost of posaconazole is 59769 NT dollars. Suggest clinicians evaluate the necessity of posaconazole prevention for AML patients with induction chemotherapy according to disease severity or the risk rate of infection. The limits of this retrospective analysis include the small sample size and the absence of disease severity. Therefore, we need more cases to evaluate the long-term efficacy.",

Valganciclovir is off-label use to CMV infection after renal transplant. Retrospective chart review of patients with CMV disease treated with valganciclovir. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data on the diagnosis and treatment of CMV infective complications in 20 patients transplanted between 2008 and 2016 (98 men and 95 women), age at the time of transplantation 21-80 years. Results: The overall CMV infection rate was 10%. The cumulative incidences of CMV infection at 3, 6, 9, 12, 60, 120 and more than 120 months after transplant were 2.6%, 3.6%, 4.1%, 5.2%, 7.3%, 9.8% and 10.4% respectively. Patient survival rate and graft survival is 70%. Duration of Valganciclovir were 78.7 \u00b1 38.7days. 70% of patients with renal function is not affected by CMV infection (P < 0.05). The most combination of immunosuppressant were Tacrolimus plus sirolimus and prednisolone. Conclusion: CMV infection after renal transplant recipients due to high mortality rate. CMV infection did not directly affected graft survival rate, but if immunocompromised patients can be due to patient expire. CMV infection with renal transplant recipients should be closely monitor and active treatment.",

The epidemiology of pneumocystis colonization among such patients is unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of Pneumocystis colonization and risk factors of Pneumocystis pneumonia among newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients. Methods: A prospective study was conducted at a medical center in southern Taiwan with a one-year follow-up after enrollment. P. jirovecii DNA was detected by real-time PCR and sequencing in oral swash samples. Clinical data were collected from medical charts in a uniform data record form. Results: Of 82 enrolled cases, P. jirovecii DNA was detected in 37 (45.1%) asymptomatic cases, who were recognized as colonizers. There were no significant differences in terms of age, sex, comorbidity, risk factor of HIV infection among participants with or without colonization. Eight (9.8%) cases developed PJP during follow ups and there was no fatal case. Pneumocystis colonization was associated with a lower CD4 count (median [IQR]: 144 (42-308) cells/mm 3 vs. 320 (169-492) cells/mm 3 ; P = 0.007), a higher HIV plasma viral load (1.97 \u00d7 10 5 [1.02 \u00d7 10 5 -4.24 \u00d7 10 5 ] vs. 3.59 \u00d7 10 4 (1.28 \u00d7 10 4 -7.89 \u00d7 10 4 ) HIV RNA copies/mL; P < 0.001), and receipt of steroid treatment (P = 0.03). The incidence of Pneumocystis pneumonia for participants with or without colonization was 239.0 and 22.3 cases per 1000 person-year respectively. By the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the cases of Pneumocystis colonization were associated with a higher risk of PJP than those without colonization (Log-rank test, P = 0.04). Conclusion: Pneumocystis colonization is not uncommon in newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients and associated with an increasing risk of PJP.",

Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is more common, and its prevalence is increasing over the world. Asymptomatic bacteriuria, also referred to as bacteriuria or asymptomatic urinary infection, is a common finding among CKD patients with varying prevalence by age, sex, sexual activity, and in both men and women with abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of and the risk factors for asymptomatic bacteriuria among CKD patients. Methods: A prospective study will be conducted at a center in Tainan, Taiwan. Participants if they are aged >20 years with chronic renal disease attending the outpatient clinic will be enrolled in this prospective, observational study. At the initial visit, all subjects were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire and submitted a midstream urine specimen for evaluation of bacteriuria and pyuria. During the subsequent follow-up for one year, the care of participants will be followed the treatment guidelines and clinical practices for CKD according decision of attending physicians. Clinical data will be obtained from a standardized medical chart abstraction by use of uniform data abstraction forms. Results: 482 participants were enrolled, asymptomatic bacteriuria was identified among 41 participants (8.5%). The incidence was 85.1 per 1000 person-years. Participants with diabetes were risk for asymptomatic bacteriuria (P < 0.001). Of 19 (4.0%) cases developed urinary tract infections during following period and there was no fatal case. The participants with asymptomatic bacteriuria (P = 0.017) and diabetic (P = 0.014) participants were risk for development of UTIs. Escherichia coli (30, 70.7%) following Enterococcus species (6, 14.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3, 7 .3%) were most common identified bacteria of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Symptoms include abdominal pain, watery diarrhea and bloody stool. We report on a HIV patient with delayed diagnosis of CMV colitis, who was initially treated for amebic colitis but with relapse. Rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment are therefore particularly important in these contexts. Methods: Case study Results: A 27 year-old man with HIV infection had water diarrhea for 2 weeks. Fever with general skin rash was noted for 3 days. Then, he visited our hospital. On examination, the temperature was 38.1\u00b0C; the blood pressure, 107/68 mm Hg; and the pulse, 84 beats per minute. Diphenhydramin and methylprednisolone were used for suspected allergy. Initial laboratory data showed WBC, 11.200/ \u03bcL; CD4 counts, 478/uL; creatinine, 0.65 mg/dL; S-GOT, 664 U/L; S-GPT, 619 U/L and total bilirubin, 2.82 mg/dL. Amoebiasis antibody titer was 1:4096 by using indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA). Metronidazole had been used for 5 days. However, acute hepatitis (S-GOT, 1377 U/L and S-GPT, 1696 U/L), elevated bilirubin (total, 7.77 mg/dL and direct, 5.85 mg/dL) and severe coagulopathy ( prothrombin time, 31.6 seconds) occurred. He was transferred to the intensive care unit for suspected sepsis and acute liver failure. Colonoscopy showed mucosal hyperemia with edema in the whole colon and multiple ulcers in the transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum, favoring amebic colitis. Piperacillin/tazobactam and metronidazole had been given for one week. His condition improved and he was transferred to general ward. However, worsening water diarrhea relapsed and episodes of hypotension occurred. The pathology of mucosal biopsy revealed CMV colitis. Meanwhile, blood CMV viral load was 889 IU/mL and CMV antigenemia was 1 cell per 200,000 PMN. The CMV-PCR results were positive in blood and stool samples. Therafter, intravenous ganciclovir achieved rapid improvement of diarrhea and liver function. He was discharged after 3 weeks of hospital stay. Conclusion: False-positive amebic IHA was ever reported. Our case highlights the importance of histopathological diagnosis for watery diarrhea in HIV patients. Blood and stool CMV-PCR might help presumptive diagnosis. However, the possibility of CMV colitis alone, following or coexisting with amebic colitis was difficult to discern. CMV activity might be enhanced by steroids, which therapy should be careful in HIV patients even without low CD4 count.",

Background: Mycobacterium abscessus is extremely difficult to treat and considered incurable. Pulmonary disease caused by M. avium complex (MAC) usually occurs in patients with chronic lung disease or HIV/AIDS. Here we report a case of MAC lung disease with a previous history of M. abscessus lymphadenitis in a 50-yearold female chef. Methods: The patient presented with chronic cough and dyspnea in April, 2013. Sputum was negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Neck computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple cervical lymphadenopathy ( Figure) . Chest HRCT revealed a RUL alveolar lesion and right hilar lymphadenopathy. Multiple fixed enlarged cervical LN's were found along level II-V, right lateral neck with desmoid adhesion to surrounding soft tissue at surgery. Pathology revealed granulomatous inflammation, and AFB was positive. Antituberculosis (TB) treatment was initiated with HERZ (isoniazid, ethambutol, rifampin, pyrazinamide). Sputum culture later grew a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM), and pyrazinamide was switched to azithromycin in June 2013. She had free T4 of 0.87 ng/ dL, TSH 0.260 uIU/mL, anti-TG 95.1 IU/mL, and anti-TPO 146.1 IU/ mL. Fine needle aspiration in Dec., 2013 revealed Hashimoto's thyroiditis. She completed her anti-TB treatment in Jan., 2014. Pus culture grew M. abscessus, and anti-mycobacterial treatment was switched to clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin at National Taiwan University Hospital in Feb., 2014. The patient could not tolerate ciprofloxacin, which was changed to levofloxacin and doxycycline. The patient did not respond to the new anti-NTM therapy, so she was admitted to Tzu Chi Hospital in April 2014. Results: Chest film revealed RLL infiltrate, and Mycoplasma IgM was positive. Anti-NTM treatment was switched to intravenous tigecycline, levofloxacin and amikacin, in addition to oral clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim treatment. Antiinterferon (IFN)-\u03b3 autoantibodies were positive. Sputum culture grew a NTM, which was identified as MAC by an official TB Center at Tainan. Because the patient responded to the new anti-NTM therapy, we didn't change the regimen. Eventually the neck lymphadenopathy relapsed when we changed her oral anti-NTM treatment to clarithromycin, levofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to this infection. Conclusion: Patients of M abscessus lung disease could have coexisting or previous history of MAC pulmonary infection. Anti-IFN-\u03b3 autoantibodies may play a role in mycobacterial infections, particularly in persons without predisposing conditions. Patients with M. abscessus pulmonary disease should be treated with multidrug anti-mycobacterial therapy based on susceptibility test results whenever available, and surgical resection may offer a more favorable response in selected cases.",

Background: Mycobacterium mucogenicum is a rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) frequently isolated from tap water or from respiratory specimens. It is associated with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. Methods: A 69-year-old male florist had a medical history of BPH, anemia, and hypertension. He started taking a health drink called \"Imumio Miracle Water,\" which was hydrogen enriched water with \"Super Lutein\" produced by Naturally Plus Company, in mid Aug., 2015. He then developed nodular skin lesions involving bilateral upper limbs 2-3 weeks thereafter. He lost 3 kg of weight, and had intermittent fevers since Sep., 2015. He stopped taking the health drink in late Sep., 2015. Whole body Gallium scan revealed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed cervical, axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. ESR was 103 mm/hr, CRP 5.85 mg/dL, cold agglutinin 1:128 (+), and CMV IgG: 144 AU/mL. He was referred to Infectious Diseases service under the impression of Kikuchi disease. Results: The skin lesions were consistent with prurigo nodularis. ( Figure. ) Sputum culture grew a non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). He was started on azithromycin, rifabutin and ethambutol for possible MAC, although HIV test was negative. MAC PCR was negative. Anti-interferon-\u03b3 autoantibodies were also negative. Axillary biopsy did not show lymphoma, or toxoplasmosis. Additional lymph node biopsy by mediastinoscopy revealed lymphoid hyperplasia. He remained febrile, and anti-NTM treatment was switched to tigecycline and meropenem for possible RGM. Bone marrow biopsy was negative for lymphoma. Clarithromycin was added, and the patient became afebrile. The isolate was finally identified as M. mucogenicum, and susceptibility testing showed susceptible to clarithromycin, tigecycline, imipenem, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and linezolide. The patient had oral clarithromycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and linezolide at OPD, but we soon discontinued sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim due to allergy. The skin lesions resolved a few weeks after initiating the combination treatment, and repeat Ga scan and chest CT demonstrated resolution of lymphadenopathy, but follow up ESR and CRP levels were still high after anti-NTM treatment for a total of 18 months. The patient did not have thrombocytopenia with linezolid treatment throughout the course. Testing of the health drink did not show M. mucogenicum.",

Patients with SLE have a 25-50% chance of developing abnormal liver tests in their lifetime. In many cases, the prevalence of the concomitant hepatopathy is higher when associated with SLE than alone. Use of these drugs in patients with previous HBV infection can result in severe liver damage if the virus is reactivated. Case Report: This 52-year-old man, a business man working in China previously, had hepatitis B and SLE. He began to have leg edema and bowel habit change and hyperbilirubinemia was found. Gastroenterologist suspected \"acute cholestatic hepatitis or chronic hepatitis B with reactivation, decompensated status.\" Baraclude was started, however bloody stools passage occurred. Colonscopy were repeated and showed a large nearly circumfrential rectal ulcer with out-pouched sac and large blood clots, and blood-covered mucosa from rectum to terminal ileum with much blood clots at terminal ileum. After admitted to our ICU, there were only intermittent bloody stools in the first days. Dyspnea aggravated and was suspected due to lung edema r/o pneumonia by CXR. He received endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation after failure of diuresis/albumin and high flow nasal cannula use. Fever was present on admission and recurred up to 40 degree Piperacillin/ tazobactam and moxifloxacin were given since admission. Pre-liver transplant computed tomography scan showed suspicious lower rectal perforation and then sigmoid loop colostomy performed on 3/31. After further discussion with radiologist, SLE vasculitis involving several major vessels was suspected, which rendered liver transplant not feasible according to the radiologist's suggestion. His liver function also continued to deteriorate. Due to severe coagulopathy, recurrent bleeding occurred. ICH was suspected when dilated and fixed pupils were found. Brain image could not be performed due to unstable oxygenation and hemodynamics. After discussion with his wife, she requested for comfort care only. He finally passed away after 2days later. Conculsion: Liver dysfunction in the presence of SLE can be caused by many factors, but when at the time of SLE onset, either SLE itself or drugs can be the cause. The features of liver dysfunction and its causes need to be elucidated and considered before treating SLE.",

Methods: We report a 36-year-old male electronics processing staff presented to the Emergency Department with a rapid onset fever with productive cough. He'd been hospitalized for many times in recent 5 years due to recurrent asthma requiring oral prednisolone, and pneumonia, including a Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia 2 years ago and an aspergillosis pneumonia 6 months ago He recovered from 4 months of voriconazole treatment, which had been stopped for 2 months. Complete blood count showed peripheral eosinophilia during the attacks. He also developed palpitation and neuropathy since 3 months ago. Physical examination demonstrated a fever of 39.7\u00b0C, tachycardia at 122 bpm, wheezing and basal crackle breath sounds, elastic nontender purplish nodules at fingers and palms, and paresthesia and muscle atrophy predominantly at both thighs. Chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltration and lab tests demonstrated leukocytosis of 21,940/\u03bcL, eosinophilia of 65%, elevated procalcitonin of 67.54 ng/mL, and elevated CRP of 13.37 mg/dL. Results: The patient was given piperacillin/tazobactam as empiric treatment. He then developed ventricular fibrillation on hospital day 2, and was intubated and transferred to medical ICU after CPCR. Chest X-ray showed consolidation with air bronchogram in both lungs ( Figure 1 ). Cardiac echo demonstrated global hypokinesia. EGPA was diagnosed according to the 1990 ACR diagnostic criteria, treatment with high dose intravenous methylprednisolone and rituximab started, and his eosinophilia, leukocytosis, and pulmonary infiltration on chest X-ray gradually subsided. His intermittent fevers persisted, though. Blood, urine, and stool cultures were negative for common pathogens, and influenza, HSV, CMV, Cryptococcus, P. jirovecii, and HIV were negative. A sputum culture grew Candida albicans, and Aspergillus DNA tests were equivocal in blood and sputum. The patient became afebrile and procalcitonin and CRP levels returned to normal limits after antibiotics were shifted to the combination of meropenem, tigecycline and caspofungin after several attempts. Finally, the patient was confirmed to have CMV replication by positive CMV pp67, and was discharged after completing 14 days of ganciclovir treatment. Conclusions: Opportunistic infections should be considered when fever with abnormal procalcitonin and CRP levels persists despite that EGPA was grossly under controlled. Cardiac involvement may lead to life-threatening arrhythmia in EGPA.",

            "text": "Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is increasingly recognized in critically ill immunocompetent patients because of previous studies demonstrated an association between CMV disease and increased mortality rates, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and nosocomial infections. Molecular assays are now considered to be the \"gold standard\" for assessment of human CMV infection and disease in those at risk from severe associated clinical manifestations. The nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assay, CMV pp67 late Gene transcripts (CMVpp67) is suggested by published reports for reliable prognosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of the medical records of patients in medical, surgical and burn intensive care units (ICU) with positive and negative detection of human CMVpp67. We compared the characteristics of 18 patients with positive CMVpp67 with those of 64 patients with negative CMVpp67. Results: Under the univariate analysis, patients with positive CMV pp67 are associated with higher proportion of sepsis (56.2:83.3%, p = 0.036), longer ICU lengths of stay ( p = 0.004), and longer hospitalization days ( p = 0.002). However, after considering all the variables in the multivariate analysis, there were no statistical significances among all the variables and CMV pp67 status. In addition, we also found that CMV pp67 status was not associated with the mortality rate (OR = 0.07, 95%CI = <0.001-9.09). But those who died were associated with more different antibiotics use (OR = 2.3, 95%CI = 1.05-5.05), higher percentage of vasopressor use (OR = 206.5, 95%CI = 5.52->999.99), higher prevalence of end stage renal disease (OR = 195.1, 95%CI = 2.27->999.99) but shorter hospitalization days (OR = 0.96, 95%CI = 0.93-1.00). Conclusion: In conclusion, in our cross sectional study, within critically ill patients, there were no correlation of positive CMV pp67 with the characteristics we assumed to be; therefore, we couldn't tell if there is any parameter with higher positive CMV pp67 rate. In addition, positive CMV pp67 wasn't related to higher mortality rate. Owing to controversial results compared to previous studies, further larger sample size studies are necessary to develop more accurate correlation results. Background: The establishment of bacterial species identification through gene sequencing triggered an increase in the reported cases of non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection caused by new bacterial species, which prompted the urgent need for the establishment of diagnosis and treatment regimens. Methods: The patient was a man at age 64. Upon being observed with minor hemoptysis in December 2011, the patient visited our hospital. Granular patterns were observed dominantly in the rightlung, along with bronchodilation and partial cavitary lesion, which led to the suggested diagnosis of pulmonary mycobacteriosis.",

While both specimen were identified with mycobacteria specularly\u00b1and in culture positive, TB and MAC-PCR found it negative, and it was confirmed unidentifiable through DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH). The case was then followed up as pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection but observed with gradual progression of the lesion, which led to two courses of sputum cultivation to identify the mycobacteria in September 2016. While the cultures were identified positive, both TB-LAMP and MAC-PCR returned negative results, and DDH failed to identify it. In order to identify the causal bacteria, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was conducted. Results: 16Sr RNA gene sequencing found it 100% phasic with M. shinjukuense. As the clinical and bacteriological findings suffice the criteria by American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America Guideline, the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection triggered by the said bacteria. Conclusion: M. shinjukuense, initially reported in Japan in 2011, is a new type of non-tuberculous mycobacteria belonging to the 3rd bacterial group under Runyon classification. Because tuberculosis complex rapid diagnostic techniques like Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct (MTD) or Transcription-reverse transcription concerted method (TRC) occasionally return a false-positive result, diagnosis requires an extra caution. There are reports of chemotherapies using CAM/RFP/EB and INH/RFP/EB, suggesting the treatments' effectiveness.",

Many isolates represent colonization or contamination of the specimen, but not true infection. Methods: This 24-year-old woman, a nurse of a local clinic, presented with a 3-month history of fevers. She started with intermittent fevers of 40\u00b0C, with blood-tinged sputum, sore throat, vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting and headache. She also noted a mass on the right neck, 3 centimeter in size. Additionally, she had recurrent oral ulcers. Her grandmother had a history of tuberculosis. She had a history of exposure to a dog. No drug, toxin or travel history was identified. Results: The complete blood counts with differential count and platelet count, blood cultures, blood chemistries, ESR, CRP, urinary analysis, purified protein derivative skin test, abdominal sonography, chest radiograph and high resolution computed tomography of the chest revealed unremarkable findings. The acid-fast stain of sputum showed equivocal result in only one of the initially three specimens. Only one of the three sputum cultures grew a NTM. The head and neck CT showed bilaterally enlarged neck lymph nodes over level II/III, especially right level II. The survey of Streptococcus A, Cryptococcus, M. pneumoniae, syphilis, HIV, CMV and HSV, revealed unremarkable results, and no infectious sources were identified despite the investigations by the dermatologist, gynecologist, otolaryngologist, dentist and gallium-67-labeled leukocyte scanning. No malignancies were found by examining CEA, CA15-3, CA125, CA19-9, and by colonoscopy . The surveys of  autoimmune diseases, including T3, T4, TSH, anti-TG, anti-TPO, C3,  C4, ferritin, IgA, IgG, IgM, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, anti-Jo-1, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-CENPB, anti-Scl-70 , anti-Sm, anti-RNP and anti-nDNA, were negative. The anti-interferon-\u03b3 autoantibodies were also negative. The NTM was further idntified as M. gordonae by PCR at an official Mycobacterium reference laboratory. The diagnosis was established by one equivocal AFB stain and only one positive culture result, which did not fit American Thoracic Society Diagnosis Criteria for pulmonary NTM infection. However, the patient became afebrile with rifampicin, ethambutol and isoniazid treatment, and the cervical lymphadenopathy resolved a few weeks later. All the associated symptoms were gone and the patient cured without relapse with a total of 11months of the anti-NTM treatment and 12 months of follow-up. Conclusion: The most effective treatment regimen for M. gordonae has not been established. However, the clinical response to specific antimycobacterial therapy indicates possible disease presence. The recommended duration of therapy is not known.",

            "text": "Background: The GeneXpert test is a new automated molecular test which detects the DNA in Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB), as well as testing for the genetic mutations associated with resistance to the drug Rifampicin (RIF). Some organizations have claimed that the GeneXpert test is going to revolutionize the diagnosis and care of patient with MTB. It provides results directly from sputum specimen in less than 2 hours. WHO recommended that the test should be used as the initial diagnosis test in individuals suspected of having Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB). The purpose of our study was to assess the performance to detection of drug resistant MTB of the GeneXpert Test compared to conventional culture methods when implemented into the normal clinical workflow of a regional hospital in south Taiwan. Methods: WHO emphasized that the GeneXpert MTB/RIF test does not eliminate the need for conventional microscopy culture and drug sensitivity testing (DST), as it detects both live and dead bacteria. We assessed the performance of GeneXpert test from April 2015 to April 2017 with all of new directly sputum smear acidfast bacilli (AFB) stain positive tuberculosis suspects. Each new AFB smear-positive patient's specimen was processed with reflecting GeneXpert test and then sent to our referral laboratory for conventional MTB culture and DST. Results: A total of 40 patients with suspected pulmonary MTB who had a smear positive AFB sputum specimen were enrolled into the study. Among these 40 patients, 39(97.5%) had no prior history of MTB and 1(0.25%) were retreatment MTB case. Overall, 32(80%) samples were culture positive, 8(20%) samples were culture negative. Both GeneXpert and conventional DST revealed 32 (100%) MTB isolates had no RIF resistance. There was 100% agreement between the GeneXpert and conventional DST results in detecting RIF resistance MTB. Conclusion: This study showed and verified the accuracy of GeneXpert test, and this result was similar to those of some early experimental findings and previous reports. The main advantages of the GeneXpert test are, for diagnosis, reliability when compared to sputum microscopy and the speed of getting the result when compared with culture. For diagnosis of MTB, although sputum microscopy is both quick and cheap, it is often unreliable. Although culture gives a definitive diagnosis, to get the result usually takes weeks rather than the hours of the GeneXpert test.",

Mostly, NTM only cause disease in whom with impaired host defense, such as immunosupressed patients. Mycobacterium haemophilum is belonging to the group of NTM, which frequently found in environmental habitats, and known to cause cutaneous and subcutaneous infections. Mycobacterium haemophilum infection is hard to treat and there is no standard guidelines are available now. Hence, we share a patient infected with cutaneous Mycobacterium haemophilum responded well to the treatment. Methods: A 75-year-old female with a history of type 2 DM and end stage renal disease received renal transplantation 18 years ago, was under mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone as immunosuppression drug for years. She got a left wrist contussion injury and received tranditional chinese herbal medicine applied on the wound 6 months before. Initially, the wound swelled with erythematous base, later much erythematous papules developed along forearm, fingers and face, then progressed to tender nodules, ruptured with odorous pus, and poor healing ulcers left. She was admitted under the impression of cellulitis, which pus culture yield NTM, Mycobacterium haemophilum by molecular test. She received antibiotics with rifampin, moxifloxacin and clarithromycin. Immunosuppression was adjusted to low dose prednisolone only. However, due to persistant poor healing wound, antibiotics was adjusted to rifabutin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin and doxycycline. Clarithromycin was withdrawn on the second week for suspected side effect of vomiting. Tigecycline was added for secondary wound infection. In addition, plastic surgeon suggested wound care with hypochlorous acid and Microdacyn 60 and performed local debridement once. Results: After admission for one month, there was progressive epithelialization over skin defects of left hand. No more new nodules were found over the integument. She was discharged with oral rifabutin, ciprofloxacin, and azithromycin. After 3 months of treatment, her skin lesion had totally recovered. Conclusion: In immunocompromised host with ulcerating skin lesion, M. haemophilum infection should be taken into consideration, especially when AFB is seen by direct microscopy while routine mycobacterial cultures remain sterile. In most cases, recovery after prolonged antimycobacterial treatment is common.",

Diagnosis was made by positive GeneXpert or culture. 89% of patients had received chemotherapy, including steroids. Patients were treated with standard first-line TB drugs, except for 5 haematology patients who received rifampicin-sparing regimes and 8 oncology patients who received levofloxacin instead of pyrazinamide. 11 patients developed treatment-related complications. All cause-mortality was 22.2%. The transplant group comprised of 4 renal and 2 haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT). There were no liver transplant recipients. The median age was 53 years old. 4 patients had pulmonary TB, of which 3 had positive sputum smears, indicating high infectivity rate. 3 of four renal transplant recipients developed TB at a median of 6 years post-transplant (range 5-7 years). Both HSCT patients developed TB within 6 months post-transplant. All but 1 patient were still on immunosuppression at the time of TB diagnosis. Of the 4 patients who completed treatment, rifampicinsparing regimes were used, with drug-associated complications occurring in 2 patients. The median treatment duration was 9.5 months (range 9-15 months). All-cause mortality was 14.3%. Conclusion: Transplant patients and patients with active malignancy who develop TB are at risk of complications of disease and treatment, and have a high mortality rate. Efforts to decrease active TB rates in this group of immunocompromised patients can reduce patient morbidity and mortality.",

Background: As one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne infectious diseases, dengue results in various clinical outcomes ranging from mild fever to fatal hemorrhagic shock. There is continuously an unmet clinical need for biomarkers of dengue severity. Macrophage activation has been recently observed in severe dengue patients. Serum ferritin is also one of the macrophage activation markers in vivo. This study aims to clarify the relationship between serum ferritin levels and the development of severe dengue in children. Methods: Patients younger than 18 years admitted to a tertiary medical center in southern Taiwan with laboratory-confirmed dengue infections during the 2015 dengue outbreak were included in the current study. Epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations and laboratory data of these patients were analyzed by electronic chart record. Serum ferritin levels were determined in patients with available specimens by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Results: Totally seventy-two pediatric dengue patients (40 males) were grouped by the updated World Health Organization classification. Among them, 53 patients (73.6%) were with warning signs, 6 (8.3%) were classified as severe dengue. Serum ferritin levels was significantly increased in patients with clinically severe dengue (7298 \u00b1 1497 ng/mL) compared with dengue with warning signs (1008 \u00b1 261.3 ng/mL) and age-matched healthy participants. Serum ferritin levels are higher in severe cases on 4th day of dengue infection, a cut-off value of 2377 ng/mL also predicted severe dengue in children with area under curve 0.9853 in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: 40 patients were histopathologically confirmed as KFD, and the mean age of the patients was 13.9 \u00b1 3.1 years. The male to female ratio was 1:1. The lymph node involvements were often cervical (95%) with features of unilateral predisposition (75%), polyadenopathy (84.4%) and tenderness (56.3%). Fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and tonsillitis were other common presentations. Laboratory findings included leukopenia (56.5%), monocytosis (63.6%), and positive results of EB-VCA IgG (88.9%), EB-VCA IgM (22.2%), EBEA IgG (22.2%) and EBNA IgG (88.9%). The univariate analysis of prolonged fever with lymphopenia, monocytosis, thrombocytopenia and necrotizing type in histopathology was disclosed as statistically significant (P < 0.05). Glucocorticoids and Hydroxychloroquine were administered in 15.6% of patients respectively, along with symptomatic treatments for the rest. Recurrence occurred in 11.1% of patients without Hydroxychloroquine treatment. In situ hybridization was performed using internal repeat 1 fragment DNA and EBV-coded small RNA (EBER-1) for EBV, and showed that cases were negative for EBV genome. Conclusion: KFD should be suspected in children with febrile cervical lymphadenopathy, especially when concomitant with leukopenia, monocytosis and past Epstein-Barr virus infection. Lymphopenia, monocytosis, thrombocytopenia and necrotizing type in histopathology are reliable predictors for prolonged fever. Our results suggest EBV may not have causative role in the pathogenesis of KFD.",

Almost 40-60% of all infants infected in the first year and 85-90% infected by age two. Reinfection is common, even within one respiratory season and children tend to have increased risk wheezing episode after RSV infection. The aim of this study is to study the epidemiology of RSV and non-RSV acute bronchiolitis and the effectiveness of Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology. Methods: A retrospective review of the medical records of children under 2 years of age with acute bronchiolitis hospitalized in a tertiary medical center (VGHKS) in southern Taiwan between January 2005 and December 2014. The patients were grouped in two: RSV positive and RSV negative. We checked the gender and age distribution from the two groups and in addition, we reviewed the duration of hospitalization as well. Results: There were 1727 patients hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis, and (16%) were RSV infections. The male to female distribution was 148 vs 96 in the RSV positive group and 944vs 539 in the RSV negative group. RSV bronchiolitis had longer hospital stays (9 vs. 7 days, P < 0.0001), and the patients suffer from RSV related bronchiolitis were younger of age (0.23 vs 0.5 years, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: RSV related acute bronchiolitis has different seasonality in Taiwan. This disease cause higher morbidity in younger infants and has a more prolonged length of hospital stay. Children who received Palivizumab had less RSV related bronchiolitis.",

Infectious Diseases Service, UHC \"Mother Theresa\", Tirana, Albania Background: In the last 60 years, there have been many researches on the various causes of fever, as the definitions and patterns of disease have changed and serological and imaging tools are improved estabilishing in this way the diagnose sooner. Tumoral pathologies are often presented as prolonged febrile syndromes, with fever as the only dominant clinical pattern. In everyday practice they also represent a considerable number of misdiagnoses, mainly infectious nosologies. Considering that tumors and fever are already a solid clinical binomial, the febrile profile has become the most attractive part of tumoral pathologies. Methods: Our study includes 123 cases, during 2010-2015, age groups 20-70 years. The epidemiological study is based on a survey, according to gender, age group and residence; the clinicaldiagnostic study is based on detailed anamnesis, epidemiological survey, clinical, biological, biochemical, microbiological and serological research. Results: Epidemiological Males were 79 cases and females 44 cases. Mean age was 45 years old, resident in town 82 and countryside 41. Clinical A.

Conclusion: We identified 17 types of febrile tumors, with fever as the first clinical manifestation. Tumor fever debuted in 5 different types; continuous fever dominated with 29.3% of cases. Diagnostic orientation to malignances followed a detailed anamnestic, laboratory and imagery screening which excluded important infectious disease in the first place. At the end of this study we are convinced that the febrile profile is also an important diagnostic tool for a rapid diagnosis of malignancies.",

Efforts to manage this group of patients are strongly focused on both; the clinical profiling of infected patients and their adecuate treatment, always aiming at the efficacy and maximum safety for these patients Methods: During a one year period, out of 863 hemodialysis patients, we selected 55 patients who resulted anti-HCV IgM positive, agegroup 20-75 years old who had different underlying chronic diseases. Patients evidenced a creatine clearance of <10 ml/ min, detectable anti-HCV antibody and HCV-RNA in the serum, and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Patients HIV and Hepatitis B coinfections and patients with decompensated hepatic cirrhosis were excluded from the study. Patients underwent monotherapy with pegylated interferon Alfa 2a 135mcg per week for 24 weeks. Results: Epidemiological and clinical findings: 55 patients with mean age 43.5 years, F / M 1.16 ratio, average time in hemodialysis 10.5 years and underlying diseases: chronic renal failure \u221255 cases, acute pielonephritis \u22121, renal polycystosis \u22126, congenital renal atrophy \u22121, nephrolithiasis-2, transplant \u22122, nefrectomy-3, arterial hypertension-2, and spondiloarthrosis \u22121 cases. Laboratory data evidenced elevated serum level of ALT which varied from 98 to 2047UI/L and bilirubine levls up to 2.3 mg/dL. Laboratory data also evidenced anemia in 53 cases, leucopenia 43 cases and thrombocytopenia 46 cases Therapeutic: Peginterferon Alfa 2a monotherapy resulted with sustained virological response in 60% of cases (mean HCVRNA at baseline 3.6 \u00d7 10 (5) and in the end of 24 weeks resulted undetectable). Conclusion: HCV infection in hemodyalisis patients remains the major cause of chronic liver and its complication. Each of our patients evidenced a mild clinical form of hepatitisprobably related to immunocompromised status and HD procedure and the adverse effects of peginterferon therapy appeared minimal compared to the efficacy of treatment in our patients.

Background/Case Presentation: A 65-year-old man was diagnosed rectal cancer in 2011 and recurrent perianal abscess since 2012 for more than 4 years. All his pus cultures yield Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Finegoldia magna, Eggerthella lenta, Anaerococcus prevotii, and Bacteroides uniformis. He was followed in infectious outpatient department and taken metronidazole plus ceftibuten for relapse perianal abscess recently since Dec. 2016. However, dizziness and ataxia developed about one month later. Metronidazole-induced encephalopathy was diagnosed by clinical symptoms and image study, and reversibly improved symptoms after metronidazole cessation. But, untolerable side-effect and uncontrolled infection noted when received other antibiotics for anaerobic pathogen covering. Thus, we tried to re-challenge metronidazole to achieve well infection control and to avoid it associated side-effect. Discussion: Our problem was how to avoid metronidazole related encephalopathy when re-challenge metronidazole. Our hospital has different dosage form of metronidazole, including entericcoated tablets, injection, suppository and gel. We thought suppository form (supp.) is a good choice base on pharmacokinetics of metronidazole for perianal infection. The rectal absorption of metronidazole was about one-half or even less of that oral administration. Hepatic first-pass elimination of metronidazole may partially avoid after rectal administration. Therefore, we used metronidazole 250 mg supp. every night for few days then titrated to 500mg supp. every six hours. The discharge got better and no more metronidazole related encephalopathy symptoms observed. Conclusion: Encephalopathy has been reported in patients who received metronidazole or some antibiotics. Different dosage form of drug is another choice to avoid side-effect. And we also need to consider site of infection, severity of infection and bioavailability of drug.",

Salmonella osteomyelitis is an uncommon extraintestinal manifestation and especially rare in patients without predisposing factors such as sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus or immunocompromised. Previous studies reported that Salmonella osteomyelitis accounts for only 0.8% of all Salmonella infection and 0.45% of all type of osteomyelitis. We herein present 5 immunocompetent cases of Salmonella osteomyelitis without sickle cell disease. Methods: 128 patients were diagnosed of Salmonella bacteremia between January 2006 and April 2017 at Cathay General Hospital, and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Results: All patients were older than 60 and three of them were female, showing age predilection. Three patients were diagnosed of vertebral osteomyelitis, one patient was diagnosed of tibial osteomyelitis and the remaining one patient was suspected to be sacroiliitis. All patients received protracted antibiotics treatment according to susceptibility and two patients received prolonged antibiotic administration with add-on probenecid for recurrent salmonella osteomyelitis. No patients underwent surgical intervention and all patients survived the disease. Conclusion: Salmonella osteomyelitis is rarely seen in immunocompetent adults. Duration of antibiotics is of paramount in treating these patients to avoid relapses and failure. Add-on therapy with probenecid in relapses of salmonella osteomyelitis has never been reported in preceding studies and its efficacy is encouraging in our study. Further studies are needed to investigate this approach in patients of salmonella osteomyelitis.",

Background: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance and assess the molecular characteristics of \u03b2-lactamases (ESBL, AmpC \u03b2lactamases, carbapenemases) among Enterobacteriaceae isolates that caused intra-abdominal infections (IAI) in patients hospitalized in the Asia-Pacific region during 2008-14. Methods: Multiplex PCR assay was applied for detecting the specific types of \u03b2-lactamases in 2893 isolates with ertapenem MICs >0.5 g/L. In-hospital acquisition times for most isolates were also delineated. Results: Among 2728 isolates proven with \u03b2-lactamase production, the rates of non-susceptibility to imipenem were low (average= 7.9%) among IAI Enterobacteriaceae isolates from all Asia-Pacific countries except Vietnam (17.7%) and the Philippines (10.2%). A stepwise and significant increase in annual rates of carbapenemase production among these isolates was noted. CTX-M-15, and CTX-M-14 were the dominant ESBL variants in most IAI Enterobacteriaceae species. The most abundant AmpC \u03b2-lactamase variants were bla CMY-2 among isolates of Escherichia coli and bla DHA-1 among isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. In addition, the IAI Enterobacteriaceae isolates harboring the bla CMY-2 and bla DHA-1 alleles were associated with high community-acquired rates (38.0% and 42.6%, respectively). AmpC ACT and MIR variants were mostly detected in IAI Enterobacter species. The IAI bla NDM-1, 4, 5, 7harboring isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were mostly commonly identified among IAI isolates from Vietnam and the Philippines. Also of note, bla OXA-48 -harboring IAI Enterobacteriaceae isolates were detected in the Vietnam. Conclusion: The high resistance burden in Vietnam and the Philippines warrants aggressive control policies to combat the worsening resistance trend in antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing IAIs. Background: The Brugada syndrome is a well-known autosomal dominant genetic disorder (sodium channel SCN genes: SCN5A or SCN10A\u2026etc) which predominates in male, and one of the major reasons for sudden cardiac death in middle age adults. Brugada syndrome had been widely discussed but the prevalence has not been well studied, and the risk factors are still in debate. We found a case of influenza A infection induced Brugada syndrome. Methods: Patient was a 64-year-old previously healthy nonsmoker man who had been traveled to Taitung four days prior to this admission. He denied any contact experiences but suffered from dry cough with rhinorrhea and myalgia for three days. He visited Fenglin Veterans Hospital where rapid flu test was positive for influenza A, and the patient received Relenza treatment. Two days before the admission, he had a new onset of intermittent retrosternal pain which was not aggravated by exertion or relieved at rest, and could be radiated to upper back and last 5-10 minutes. There was no fever, no nausea or vomiting during chest tightness attacked. At our Emergency room, he was afebrile with 36 o C, blood pressure was 118/53 mmHg; Heart rates was 63 beats per minute. On physical examination, he had cold sweats, regular heart beats without murmur. Chest x-ray film showed bilateral lower lungs infiltration. Serial ECG showed intermittent AV dissociation, downsloping ST-elevation at V2-4. Results: On admission, troponin I levels were elevated from 0.05 to 0.1ng/ml. He had no obvious chest pain or cardiopulmonary distress. Repeat throat swab for influenza PCR test confirmed influenza A infection. The serial ECG showed Brugada pattern and cardiac echo revealed mild anterior wall hypokinesis. Coronary angiogram revealed non-significant stenosis of left main artery and left anterior descending artery. Aspirin and statin were administered. His general condition was much improved after treatment, and chest x-ray showed decreased bilateral infiltrations. He was discharged with much improvement six days after admission, and followed up at Infectious Disease and Cardiology OPD. Later, the gene laboratory at National Taiwan University confirmed SCN5A gene mutation. Conclusion: Brugada electrocardiographic changes has not yet been associated with Influenza in current medicine, only two case reports were found on the Pubmed. However, this time we had genetic with clinical evidence shows that Infuenza A may had related to induce Brugada syndrome, which gives more information in study groups for Brugada syndrome in Taiwan.",

Echocardiography did not reveal vegetation, and Gallium-67 whole body inflammation scintigraphy did not demonstrate any source of inflammation. The patient was afebrile after admission. All laboratory data were improving during hospital stay. Then he was discharged after 15 days of ceftriaxone treatment. Conclusion: E. rhusiopathiae occurs most commonly as an occupational disease. Penicillins and cephalosporins are the drugs of choice for treatment.",

The patient was sent to the emergency room of another hospital, and had a debridement of the chest wall abscess than admitted to the intensive care unit. Pus and blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cefoperazone/sulbactam was administered. Liver abscess was considered as a possible source, but not confirmed. She was then transferred to our hospital. Results: On physical examination, there was a 7 cm long, 4 cm wide, and 3 cm deep open, clean surgical wound with some cauterized granulation tissue. White blood count was 11,400/uL. Wound culture grew oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA), and sputum culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefoperazone/ sulbactam was switched to pipercillin/tazobactam and tigecycline. The patient had a second debridement on hospital day 14. Whole body inflammation scan and chest computed tomography ( Figure. ) showed sternal osteomyelitis, mediastinitis and pericarditis. Tigecycline was switched to daptomycin for coverage of ORSA. She had sternectomy on day 47, and wound culture grew K. pneumoniae. Pipercillin/tazobactam was switched to cefmetazole. However, the infection wasn't well controlled. She had an altered consciousness and died on hospital day 90. Conclusion: Due to rare clinical experiences, we have no standard approach for PSO. However, the presentation of PSO is insidious, and a diagnosis can often be delayed. PSO should be borne in mind when a patient presents with an anterior wall abscess.",

Background: Purpura fulminans is a rare syndrome of intravascular thrombosis and hemorrhagic infarction accompanied by vascular collapse and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). It is typically associated with meningococcal infection and is rapidly progressive. Our patient is a case of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome presented as symmetric peripheral gangrene and necrosis of large areas of the skin of limbs. Methods: Patient was a 59-year-old obese woman. She came to the hospital with yellowish productive cough for one week, and had fevers for 2 days. Septic shock developed during hospital stay, and she was transferred to intensive care unit for resuscitation. She had progressive swollen face, eyelid and neck. Head and neck, chest and abdomen CT disclosed extensive cellulitis of the neck. Results: Laboratory data at admission revealed leukocytosis with left shift, acute kidney injury, and lactate acidosis. Blood cultures showed group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. Examination of pleural fluid disclosed gram-positive cocci. Cultures of sputum, pleural fluid and urine showed negative findings. The patient was treated with vancomycin, meropenem and clindamycin. 5 days after admission, she had a fever of 40\u00b0C, and blood culture grew Candida albicans. Sputum culture also grew Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. Catheter and urine cultures were sterile. Antifungal agent was administered. She had gangrene of bilateral upper and lower limbs, and right upper chest on hospital day 14. The manifestations were consistent with purpura fulminans and DIC, and she was treated with platelet transfusion and anticoagulant. 23 days after admission, she had bilateral below knee amputation. 13 days after admission, DIC developed and laboratory data revealed prolonged aPTT (>180 sec), low platelet (91 \u00d7 10 3 /uL), and elevated level of D dimer (8261.93 ng/mL). Amputation of the hands was also suggested, but the family refused further management. Then the patient had hospice and was discharged due to terminal condition. Conclusion: Purpura fulminans is rare and most commonly occurs in babies and small children, but can be more rare in adults. In severe sepsis, purpura fulminans typically develops in the distal extremities and progresses proximally affecting the whole body surface. 40-70% of adult patients with sepsis-associated purpura fulminans die. histoplasmosis. It is usually self-limiting or localized in immunocompetent individuals. Disseminated disease usually occurs in immunocompromised patients or in patients with chronic illness. We describes a Taiwanese who have human immunodeficiency viral infection and histoplasmosis. Methods: A 23-year-old man, denied major systemic disorder or foreign country travel before admission, presented to emergency room with 2-week fever. Cough, abdominal fullness and body weight loss were associated. Thrombocytopenia (Platelet 19,000/ ul), cavity in left upper lung zone and hepatosplenomegaly were noted initially. After admission, acute human immunodeficiency viral infection was diagnosed. The laboratory data also revealed hypertriglyceridemia and high ferritin. He received antiretroviral therapy immediately due to suspected virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. The bone marrow studies were also arranged. Hypotension, metabolic acidosis with respiratory failure still developed on the fifth day of hospitalization. Results: The bone marrow studies revealed abundant yeast-like microorganism in histiocytes and hemophagocytosis. The serum Galactomannan test was positive result also. Liposomal Amphotericin B was administered for invasive fungal infection. Three weeks later, the blood fungal culture which collected when admission and the bone marrow fungal culture all yield Histoplasma spp. The Liposomal amphotericin B was switched to Voriconazole orally. He was extubation successfully and discharge on the 42th day of hospitalization Conclusion: Histoplasmosis is a rare disease in Taiwan, and few microbiologically documented cases have been previously reported. It is commonly diagnosed in areas of endemicity but frequently overlooked in areas of nonendemicity due to a low index of suspicion among physicians. In HIV-infected patient who present with thrombocytopenia, hemophagocytotic syndrome and cavitary pulmonary lesion, a differential diagnosis of histoplasmosis should be kept in mind.",

Despite use of variety of diagnostic techniques, however, SAE remains a clinical diagnosis and could represent a variety of pathophysiological processes that are both related and unrelated to coexistent sepsis. Herein we describe impressive imaging in patient with SAE. Methods: We experienced a 66-year-old man with prolonged fever and diarrhea progressed into a coma, who brought to our hospital. Laboratory tests revealed multiple organ failure, and a computed tomography scan showed severe intestinal inflammation. Initial resuscitation was initiated for septic shock due to severe enteritis. His general condition gradually improved, without consciousness restoration. On day 15, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 3, and MRI was continuousuly performed. Results: MRI showed enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal in the white matter. Susceptibility-weighted imaging revealed multiple microbleeds. These findings indicated SAE, which is associated with extracranial sepsis. The pathophysiology is thought to involve blood-brain-barrier leakage. His GCS score improved to 7, and FLAIR signal enhancement in the white matter decreased on day 36. Furthermore, MRI showed decreased enhancement on day 60, without further improvement of consciousness.",

C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) is most strongly associated with fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and clindamycin. most common cause of pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). Clostridium difficile should be considered in diarrhea cases with a history of antibiotic use within the last 8 weeks (community-associated CDI) or with a hospital stay of at least 3 days, regardless of the duration of antibiotic use (hospitalacquired CDI). Methods: 43 stools were collected from the suspected CD infection cases (all > 25 years of age) admitted in two regional hospitals in north Taiwan. The samples during the period of November 2016 to May 2017. The effectiveness analysis of glutamate dehydrogenase antigen (GDH)and toxin A/B combined assay (brand A: RIDA \u00ae QUICK) versus a two-step algorithm for optimal detection of toxigenic CD. Each two-step algorithm, stools were using the RIDA \u00ae QUICK GDH for screening, if positive, tested for toxin by RIDA \u00ae QUICK Toxin A/B and tested for Toxin A &Toxin B single each other (brand B:Mascia Brunelli) to double check, then were underwent anaerobic stool culture on Cycloserine Cefoxitin Fructose Agar (CCFA). Results: Over 7 months, we can calculate the laboratories' expenses were 37% less than if combined assay alone. The brand A&B testing kits provide a rapid turnaround time than anaerobic stool culture (1 hour vs 72 hours). A total of 43 suspected CDI patients, 34.9% (15/43) were GDH positive and Toxin A/B positive was 9.3% (4/43). Distribution of sex and age with CD colonization (GDH + ) were 6 males and 4 females in age group \u226765 years (66.7%, 10/15). Two (13.3%, 2/15) were GDH-positive and toxin A/B positive by both tests. The risk of toxigenic CD (GDH + , Toxin A/B + ) infection between male and female was not significant (2.3% vs 2.3%). Conclusion: Our study suggested one or two-step algorithm for the detection of CD infection is a reliable, cost-effective, and timesaving strategy. The prevalence of toxicgenic CD infection based on a two-step algorithm is similar to that reported in previous literature in Taiwan. When GDH antigen positive had 100% match compared to the culture on CCFA agar was indentified Clostridium difficile. Also proved that C. difficile strains appear to produce the cell wall-associated enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase antigen (GDH).",

This study is intended to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with bacteraemia due to different species of BCC. Methods: Patients with BCC bacteraemia who were treated at a medical centre from January 2013 to February 2015 were evaluated. BCC isolates were identified to species level by Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS and sequencing analysis by 16S rRNA and recA genes. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. Results: Sequencing of the recA gene in the 54 blood isolates revealed 37 (68.5%) isolates of B. cenocepacia, 9 (16.7%) B. cepacia, 4 (7.4%) isolates of B. multivorans and one isolate each of B. arboris, B. pseudomultivorans, B. seminalis, and B. vietnamiensis. The overall performance of the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system for correctly identifying the 54 BCC isolates to the species level was 79.6% that was better than that (16.7%) by 16S RNA sequencing analysis. Bacteraemic pneumonia (n = 23, 42.6%) and catheterrelated bacteraemia (n = 21, 38.9%) were the most common types of infection. Higher rates of ceftazidime and meropenem resistance were found in B. cepacia isolates (33.3% and 22.2%, respectively) than in isolates of B. cenocepacia (21.6% and 10.8%, respectively) and other species (12.5% and 12.5%, respectively). Overall, the 30-day mortality rate was 38.9% (21/54). Bacteraemia caused by BCC species other than B. cenocepacia and B. cepacia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 20.005, P = 0.024) and high SOFA score (aOR 1.412, P = 0.003) were predictive of higher 30-day mortality. Conclusion: Correct identification of BCC complex to species level is important because different BCC complex species was associated with different outcomes of bacteraemia and exhibited different susceptibility patterns.",

Traditionally, initial syphilis screening begins with the nontreponemal test (traditional algorithm); however, recent advancements in instrumentation have enabled more automated and objective approaches to the treponemal test (reverse algorithm). The reverse algorithm for initial syphilis screening was limited to enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA). Recently, a TPLA method that uses Treponema pallidum components coated on latex particles using a chemical wide use automatic analyzer was developed. We evaluated the use of this reagent, instead of EIA or CIA, for initial syphilis screening in the reverse algorithm.",

Results: In the analysis, 46 of 90 samples tested positive with Mediace \u00ae TPLA, and the false positive rate was 0%. However, the false-negative rate of Mediace \u00ae TPLA was 2.27% (1 of 44), whereas that of Lumipulse \u00ae presto TP was 0% and that of Architect Syphilis TP \u00ae was 2.27%. Conclusion: The performance of Mediace \u00ae TPLA is nearly equivalent to that of Lumipulse \u00ae presto and Architect Syphilis TP \u00ae . The cost per test for Mediace \u00ae TPLA is lower than that for other tests.

In previous studies, this bacterium can survive in hard situation for 3 months or longer. In clinical, if we don't disinfect complete, it will provide a chance to spread it. So, if we had a efficient method that can culture this bacterium from environment, it would be useful for infection control. Methods: In this study, we used Banana broth as a selective broth. We collected the sample from the environment that CDI patient used before. We use the swab and 0.9% normal saline to touch the surface then put the swab into the broth. Then we culture it on 35\u00b0C without anaerobic incubacted. After 48 hours, we checked the color of the broth, if C. difficile growth on this broth, the color will become to yellow. Results: In this study, we collected 12 sample from the environment. And there were 2 broths changed to yellow. After PCR checked, all of the bacterium were C. difficile. That's to say, this broth can be a selective broth for C. difficile. Conclusion: In this study, we found the Banana broth was a great selective broth to culture C. difficile without anaerobic incubated. Otherwise, through the change of color, its very easy for staff to check the result and don't need to culture by using CCFA agar.",

We present a case of urinary tract infection and fever caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei who was admitted at a Northern Reginal hospital in Taiwan. The case is presented to highlight the identification of this rare pathogenic organism in the laboratory from the samples collected and to start the treatment early for better prognosis since the mortality is high without treatment. Methods: 46-year-old male presented to Emergency Department with symptoms of breathe heavily and hematuria and fever. On examination patient suspected urinary tract infection. Samples of urine, blood and pus collected using sterile swabs from the discharge of cellulitis was sent to microbiology laboratory for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Microbiological culture and identification revealed the etiologic agent to be Burkholderia pseudomallei. The organism was susceptible to ceftazidime (30 \u03bcg), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1.25/ 23.75 \u03bcg). The strain was resistant to amikacillin (30 \u03bcg), and colistin (10 \u03bcg). His fasting blood glucose was 233 mg/dl. Results: Patient was started with Ciprofloxacin, Ceftazidime, or Doripenem/Imipenem/Meropenem at least 14 days. He was put on antidiabetic therapy. Second sample of blood collected after five days was negative for culture. Conclusion: Urinary tract infection is common in diabetics, and in a diabetic patient B. pseudomallei, a rare pathogen can cause infection. This organism can be overlooked in routine cultures as contaminant especially if the bacterial growth on the culture plate is polymicrobial. Identification requires a great deal of clinical suspicion as well as alertness on the part of laboratory personnel. Melioidosis caused by should be considered in the differential diagnosis in diabetic men with urinary tract infection, especially if they come from areas where melioidosis is prevalent. Appropriate treatment must be initiated to prevent complications.",

IGRAs have been widely used for the diagnosis of latent and active tuberculosis in adults, but their role in diagnosing LTBI in children younger than 5 years remains debating. Here we perform an EBM approach to evaluate diagnostic accuracy for LTBI in children above the age of 5 years. Methods: A PICO was formulated, P: children above 5 years old; I: (IGRAs OR interferon-gamma OR Interferon-\u03b3); O: diagnostic accuracy for LTBI. These terms and synonyms were engaged with Boolean character (AND, OR) into a keyword to search Cochrane Library and PubMed databases. Clinical diagnostic questions, according to the Oxford Level of Evidence 2011, systematic review (SR) of cross-sectional studies with reference standard would be the best evidence. In PubMed a relevant SR was retrieved out of 87 searching results for critical appraisal. Conclusion: Though Taiwan CDC still use TST as diagnostic tool for LTBI in children younger than 5 years. Probably due to blood draws can be more difficult in young kids, or other considerations such as cost-effectiveness. However, this Level 1 evidence showed that the diagnostic performance of IGRAs were slightly higher than TST and can be used as supporting assays to detect LTBI in children above the age of 5 years.",

The histopathological diagnosis was consistent with the WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues, fourth edition (2008). Results: The ratio of men to women was 8:2 and the median age was 64 years (range: 40-77 years). The histopathologic type was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in all patients, with a subtype of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in 1 patient, follicular lymphoma in 1 patient, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 6 patients, diffuse large Tcell lymphoma in 1 patient, multiple myeoma 1 case. About malignant lymphoma, according to the Ann Arbor staging system, the clinical stage was IE in 2 patient, IIIE1 in 1 patient, IV in 5 patients. Perforation occurred prior to chemotherapy in 2 patients, after completion of the first cycle of chemotherapy in 6 patients, after 4 cycles in 1 patient, after 6 cycles in 1 patient, during the advanced stage of chemotherapy-refractory lymphoma in 1 patient, and during recurrence after complete response in 1 patient. Conclusion: According to our experience, it was suggested that curative resection is not mandatory in patients undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal perforation and it is important to start chemotherapy in the early postoperative period and select a safer surgical procedure, such as limited surgery, flexibly assessing the necessity of removing the lesions. Background: Serum procalcitonin (PCT) has been touted as a diagnostic marker to predict severe bacterial infection these days. This study was performed to evaluate the usefulness of PCT in diagnosis of various types of bacterial infection in children, by comparing with other inflammatory markers. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 447 patients under the age of 18 years who were admitted to Chung Ang University Hospital between 2011 July and 2014 June, for whom PCT value had been obtained. Patients were categorized into bacterial infection group and non-bacterial infection group. Furthermore, bacterial infection group were categorized into invasive bacterial infection (IBI), mucosal bacterial infection (MBI), toxigenic bacterial infection (TBI), and mycoplasma infection (MI) groups. IBI was defined as the infection of sterile body site such as bacteremia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and pyelonephritis. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and scarlet fever were included into TBI. MI was defined as positive mycoplasma IgM (\u2265770 IU/mL) or mycoplasma PCR. Results: Of 447 patients, 104 (23.3%) patients were diagnosed with bacterial infection. Among bacterial infection group, 73 cases (70.2%) were identified to IBI, 17 cases (16.4%) were MBI, 7 cases (6.7%) were TBI and 9 cases (8.4%) were MI group. The values of PCT (9.53 \u00b1 32.10 vs. 0.60 \u00b1 2.13), C-reactive protein (CRP; 57.86 \u00b1 55.63 vs. 33.66 \u00b1 51.55), and white blood cell (WBC; 12388.29 \u00b1 6805.38 vs. 10439.30 \u00b1 7437.23) count were higher in bacterial infection group than non-bacterial infection group (P < 0.05 for all). However, only the value of PCT was higher in IBI group than other bacterial groups (13.11 \u00b1 38.01 vs. 1.26 \u00b1 1.65 in MBI, 1.10 \u00b1 1.87 in TBI, and 1.69 \u00b1 2.06 in MI, P < 0.05 for all). In the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, the area under the curve was 0.706 for PCT, 0.691 for CRP, 0.603 for WBC and 0.501 for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The specificity for serum PCT (80%) in diagnosing invasive bacterial infection was significantly larger than those of other inflammatory markers (0.35 for CRP, 0.54 for WBC, 0.22 for ESR). Conclusion: PCT is a highly effective diagnostic marker of IBI but not effective to differentiate MBI, TBI, or MI from non-bacterial infection. Also, PCT is more useful marker to predict bacterial infection than CRP, WBC, ESR.",

E. meningoseptica infection inhumans have been presented as meningitis outbreaks in premature newborns and infants. It has a unique antibiotic susceptibility pattern. It is resistant to many antibiotics commonly used to treat infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. This is a challenge for clinicians to treat patients. Methods: In this study, 100 E. meningoseptica clinical isolates were collected from teaching Hospital from 2012 to 2016. The phoenix 100 Automated Microbiology System (Becton Dickinson) with the GN panel was used to identify bacteria and confirm antimicrobial susceptibility. The antimicrobial susceptibility against 14 kinds of antibiotics were tested. Results: The incidence of E. meningoseptica isolates increased from 7 in 2012 to 41 in 2016. Among them, 52% from sputum, 33% from blood, and more than 50% samples isolated form intensive care units (ICUs). The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test results are presented in Table 2 . E. meningoseptica was most often susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxzole (97.3%) and fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin (23.7%) and ciprofloxacin (28.5%). However, most antibiotics that target Gram-negative bacteria were not very effective against. Conclusion: E. meningoseptica had a high resistance to various antimicrobial agents. Pneumonia was the most common infection caused by E. meningoseptica, and the mortality rate was quite high. However, despite the high mortality rate, the rate of appropriate antibiotic use was notably low. Clinicians should pay attention to the disease progression and evaluate the response to current antibiotics, and if possible, consider using effective antibiotics based on culture reports.",

It has been reported that ESBL-E. coli isolates were resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. The related data is less known in regional hospitals in Taiwan. Methods: We retrospectively analyze the antimicrobial resistance profile of E. coli collected from Sep. 2015 to Aug. 2016 in a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. Only the first isolates recovered from one person is included for further analysis. The ESBL phenotype and the drug susceptibility testing were performed with Vitek 2 compact system. Odds ratio was estimated with SAS JMP software 12th version. Results: Among the 2113 E. coli isolates, 286 (13.52%) isolates produced ESBL. The susceptibility rates to antimicrobial agents of ESBL-E. coli were ampicillin: 0%, amikacin: 99.30%, ceftazidime: 0%, cefazolin: 0%, cefepime: 0% 2.47 ). Co-resistance to ESBL phenotype is observed for ampicillin, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefepime, gemtamicin, sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin, and ampicillin/sulbactam. Conclusion: The epidemiology data in a regional hospital in Taiwan revealed ESBL-E. coli were most susceptible to amikacin, ertapenem, tigecycline, colistin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Besides the co-resistance of ESBL phenotype to all tested beta-lactams, Coresistance was also observed for gemtamicin, sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin/sulbactam, and levofloxacin. The extent of co-resistance may impact the choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy.",

National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, National Health Research Institutes Background: A. calcoaceticus-A baumannii (ACB) complex comprises four genospecies: A. baumannii, A. calcoaceticus, A. nosocomialis, and A. pittii. Considerable differences exist in their epidemiology and clinical relevance but routine differentiation of these genospecies is not commonly done. The present study investigated the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of the ACB complex genospecies in the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (TSAR) program. Methods: Acinetobacter isolates were collected biennially as part of the TSAR program between 2010 and 2016 from 26 to 28 hospitals using the same collection protocols. Susceptibility to different antimicrobial agents was determined by broth microdilution in every study year but colistin was not tested in 2010. All ACB complex isolates were subjected to gyrB genospecies typing to differentiate the 4 species. Data from 2010 to 2012 were grouped together to compare with combined data of 2014 and 2016. Results: A total of 1321 ACB complex isolates were identified, including 337, 405, 290, and 289 isolates from 2010 337, 405, 290, and 289 isolates from , 2012 337, 405, 290, and 289 isolates from , 2014 337, 405, 290, and 289 isolates from , and 2016 337, 405, 290, and 289 isolates from , respectively. From 2010 337, 405, 290, and 289 isolates from -2012 337, 405, 290, and 289 isolates from to 2014 337, 405, 290, and 289 isolates from -2016 , the proportion of A. baumannii decreased from 85.7 to 79.4% while that of A. nosocomialis increased from 4.4 to 11.2% ( p < 0.001 for both), with A. pitti remaining stable at around 9%. The specimen distribution differed among A. baumannii, A. nosocomialis, and A. pitti isolates, with 55.1, 51.0, and 34.5%, respectively, from respiratory tract, and 13.9, 43.9, and 35.3%, respectively, from blood. Carbapenem nonsusceptibility in ACB complex was 64.6% in 2010-2012 and 59.9% in 2014-2016 overall ( p = NS), but was significantly higher in A. baumannii (71.1%) than in A. nosocomialis (23.5%) and A. pitti (15.1%). Colistin resistance was not detected in 2012 and was 3.1% in 2014-2016 but no mcr-1 was detected. Conclusion: The prevalence of carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii remains very high in Taiwan. The changes in ACB complex genospecies distribution in recent years plus differences in their antimicrobial susceptibility and specimen distribution indicate the need for continued surveillance of this important group of pathogens.",

Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology Background: Integrons are genetic elements capable of integrating or mobilizing gene cassettes encoding antibiotic resistance determinants. Escherichia coli is often resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents and is often associated with the production of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs), which are frequently described as a part of complex integrons, facilitate their horizontal transfer to other related and unrelated microbes. The aim of this study was to define the current prevalence and phenotypes of 100 multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli isolates from clinical specimens in central Taiwan and to investigate associations between multidrug resistance and existence of integrons. Methods: Non-duplicate 100 MDR E. coli isolates from January to July 2013 were used in this study. Firstly, susceptibility of 100 isolates to 12 antibiotics was determined by the Vitek 2 system. The extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases production was detected by disk diffusion confirmatory tests. Then, prevalence and class of integrons was detected in MDR strains by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Finally, the gene cassette arrays of class 2 integrons were identified by PCR, DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. Results: The extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases production was detected in 82% (82/100) of E. coli isolates by disk diffusion confirmatory tests. Antibiotic resistance patterns were as follows: ampicillin 100%, ampicillin/sulbactam 89%, amikacin 96%, ceftazidime 100%, ciprofloxacin 82%, ceftriaxone 100%, cefazolin 100%, imipenem 0%, gentamicin 87%, cefoxitin 38%, sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim 87%, and piperacillin/tazobactam 5%. PCR-RFLP results showed that the prevalence of integrons was confirmed in 20% of MDR isolates. Class 1 and 2 integrons were detected respectively in 5% and 20% of MDR strains. Moreover, 5 strains were found to contain both class 1 and 2 integrons. No integron class 3 was detected in any of the isolates. All of these integron 2-positive isolates contained constant gene cassette arrays of dfrA1 + sat2 + aadA1 which confer resistance to trimethoprim and streptomycin. Conclusion: In this study, MDR E. coli isolates with resistance to four or more different antibiotics were common. The data suggest that multiple and complex mechanisms involving mobile genetic elements in class 1 and class 2 integrons and antibiotic resistance have been developed in the evolution of E. coli strains in Taiwan.",

However, clinical characteristics of patients with bloodstream infections (BSI) due to metallo \u03b2-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are not well studied. Therefore, we investigated the clinical characteristics of patients infected with the MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Methods: We retrospectively conducted a chart review of the patients with MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which were isolated from blood samples, in a tertiary care hospital in Japan between April 2013 and March 2017. MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was defined as isolates from blood culture showing decreased susceptibility to meropenem (minimum inhibitory concentration, \u22652 mg/dL), and a positive result in the test using metallo-\u03b2-lactamase SMA Eiken (Eiken Chemical Co., Japan). Clinical and microbiological characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of these patients were investigated. Results: During the study period, a total of 6 adult patients were identified. The median age was 55 years, and 3 (50%) were women. All patients had severe underlying disease at the time of admission (cardiopulmonary arrest (n = 3), invasive pneumococcal infection (n = 1), bleeding esophageal varices (n = 1), and peritonitis due to diverticulitis perforation (n = 1)). Of the patients, 5 were admitted to the intensive care unit. The sources of MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae BSI were as follows: catheter-related BSI (n = 2), pyelonephritis (n = 1), cholangitis (n = 1), bacterial peritonitis (n = 1), and bacterial translocation (n = 1). Of the 6 isolates, 4 were Enterobacter cloacae and 2 were Klebsiella pneumoniae. The immunochromatography assay showed that all isolates were IMPtype. No isolates were resistant to levofloxacin and aminoglycoside. All patients had a previous history of antibiotic treatment and all isolates were isolated after more than 12 days of hospitalization. All patients were treated with either levofloxacin only or levofloxacin and aminoglycoside. Microbiologic response rates based on the results of culture tests using samples from the original infection sites were 100%. However, the all-cause 30-day mortality rate was 50%. Conclusion: This study showed MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae BSI was fatal, although rare, in patients with severe disease and longterm hospitalization. Further research is necessary to study the appropriate treatment options for MBL-producing BSI, including levofloxacin treatment based on antimicrobial susceptibility test results. Objective: With the increasing of methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) all over the world, the surgical sit infection caused by MRSA also increased. Health care workers (HCWs) carried by MRSA is the role of transmission of MRSA in the hospital. Our study will investigate the carriage rates of S. aureus and MRSA of surgical HCWs in our hospital, and have a molecular epidemiology analysis for all S. aureus strains. Methods: There were 242 pharynx swabs collected from 242 HCWs working in surgical wards, medical wards and an operating room during March-April 2016. The swabs were cultured on mannitol salt agar for choosing suspicion colony. The isolates were identified as S. aureus based on morphology, coagulase test, and VITEK test. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of all isolates was performed by modified Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. The isolates were recognized as MRSAs if they were resistant to oxacillin. All of isolates were analyzed for epidemiological relatedness by pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: Out of the 242 healthcare workers, 70 (28.9%) carried S. aureus, and 10 (4.1%)carried MRSA. MRSA carriage rate was highest among nurses (7.5%), while carriage rate among doctors was 1.9%. However, the difference was not significant (P = 0.812). The carriage rates of surgical ward A, ward B, ward C, ward D and the operating room were all above 30%. Similarly, the difference of departments and wards was not significant (P = 0.420). After the PFGE analysis, the isolates were grouped into five similarity groups: A-E. The largest number of isolates belonged to the group D and E, which accounted for 78.2%. On the other hand, two MRSA isolates of surgical ward C were identical in the term of PFGE denderogram. Conclusion: The mean carriage rate of S. aureus is 30% among our healthcare workers, which is similar to the other countries' in the world. The MRSA carriage rate is lower than other developing countries'. The carriage rates of surgical wards are not significantly different to other wards', so the surgical sit infection cause by S. aureus is not related with the difference of HCWs' S. aureus carriages. The PFGE denderogram gave the popular gene groups of S. aureus, which might help the surgical sit infection control.",

Methods: The study was conducted from January 2015 to December 2016 in five hospitals in Taiwan. Stool culture for C. difficile was done in fecal sample from patients with diarrhea. Multiplex PCR was used to detect tcdA, tcdB, cdtA, cdtB, and tcdC deletion, and antimicrobial susceptibility was investigated in toxigenic C. difficile isolates. Ribotypes (RTs) of those isolates with tcdC deletion and tcdA-/tcdB+ were determined. Results: Of 1199 C. difficile isolates collected from five hospitals, 904 isolates were toxigenic: tcdA+/tcdB+ (794, 87.8%) and tcdA-/ tcdB+ (110, 12.2%). Of the toxigenic isolates, 81 (9.0%) isolates had tcdC deletion and binary toxin, i.e., hypervirulent isolates. RT078 family (61 isolates: 75.3%, including RT033, RT078, RT126, and RT127) and RT027 family (15: 18.5%, including RT027, RT034, and RT075) were predominant. Of 110 tcdA-/tcdB+ isolates, 100 (90.9%) isolates were identified as RT017. Metronidazole and vancomycin resistance, though rare, was present in 1.2% and 2.0%, respectively, of toxigenic isolates, and of note there were 9 isolates resistant to both metronidazole and vancomycin. Irrespective of toxigenic or non-toxigenic isolates, MIC 90 of doxycycline (8 \u03bcg/mL) was higher than that of tigecycline (\u22640.0625 \u03bcg/mL), suggestive of more potent antibacterial activity of tigecycline than doxycycline. Conclusion: Hypervirulent isolates accounted for 9% of toxigenic isolates in Taiwan, and the dominant ribotypes were RT078 and RT027 family. Metronidazole or vancomycin remains active against the vast majority of C. difficile isolates.",

Health care workers (HCWs) have been identified as the source of MRSA in numerous outbreak investigations. Epidemiology of MRSA nasal colonization in a range of HCWs have been studied, and yet out-ofhospital health care providers have limited data. This study aims to characterize the risk factors and molecular epidemiologic characteristics of MRSA colonization in out-of-hospital health care providers and HCWs in a teritary hospital. Methods: This was a prospective study. Participants included outof-hospital health providers such as Emergency Medical Technicians, paramedics, nurses working in the long term care facilities and in-hospital health care providers such as physicians and nurses. Swabs were obtained from nares and processed using standard laboratory techniques. Standard microbiologic methods were used to identify methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and MRSA. Molecular epidemiologic methods included pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, PCR detection of Panton-Valentine leukocidin, and SCCmec and multilocus sequence typing. Results: A total of 112 out-of-hospital health care providers and 137 in-hospital HCWs participated. The combined prevalence rate of MRSA was 7%. The majority of the MRSA colonization were in female (16/17, 94%) and in-hospital nurses (12/17, 71%). Five (29%) of the out-hospital providers had MRSA colonization. Nurses (OR: 9.33, 95% CI: 2.03-42.90) and clinical service year between 5 and 10 years (OR: 3.66, 95% CI: 1-13.67) had higher risk for MRSA colonization. Eight different strains of MRSA were identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The majority of the MRSA was SCCmec IV and V strains, three of which carried Panton-Valentine leukocidin. A unique ST typing 398 from a hospital nurse who ever traveled to Europe was identified in this study. Conclusion: The findings suggest that there is substantial colonization of MRSA among in-hospital and out-hospital health care providers. Implementations of infection control strategies should be applied high priority in those HCWs.",

Results: Overall, serotype Ia was the most frequently found in the population (31%), followed by serotypes Ib (24%), V (18%), and III (13%). Serotype Ib increased significantly throughout the study period ( p < 0.001), to become the most frequent serotype after 2013. Over 40% of the isolates belonged to CC1, including most isolates of serotypes Ib (n = 110) and V (n = 65), all sharing surface protein gene alp3 and PI-1 + PI-2a. Overall erythromycin and clindamicin resistance rates were 35% and 34%, respectively, both increasing throughout 2009-2015 ( p < 0.010). Macrolide resistance was associated with CC1 ( p < 0.001) and serotype Ib ( p < 0.001). Genomic analysis revealed that the Ib/CC1 lineage probably resulted from the acquisition of the type Ib capsular operon in a single large recombination event (\u2248300 Kb) by a representative of the V/CC1 macrolide resistant lineage. Conclusion: The serotype Ib/CC1 genetic lineage was detected for the first time and expanded in Portugal in the last six years and is now dominant among the GBS population causing invasive disease in adults.",

Background: Enterococcus spp. are well-known indigenous bacteria that often isolated from human and/or animal specimens. Generally, these species are non-pathogens but it can sometime induce infectious diseases especially in compromised host. The purpose of this study was to assess the molecular typing of Enterococcus faecium which isolated from single site to evaluate the association and/or differentiation of genotype, infection site, patient group and antimicrobial sensitivity. Methods: We extracted DNA from 159 of E. faecium isolates at Aichi Medical University Hospital in 2015 and assesed random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR method to analysed genotypeing. The antimicrobial sensitivity were examined by the RAISUS automated method (Nissui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd, Tokyo). Retrospectively analysed with the patients background and/or infection site by medical records to characterize with the correlation between genotype. Results: The results of RAPD-PCR showed that 159 clinical isolates of E. faecium classified into 8 genotypes (Type 1; 52.8%, Type 2; 4.4%, Type 3; 20.8%, Type 4; 11.9%, Type 5; 8.2%, Type 6, 7 and 8; 0.6%). As a result of classification, more than 50% of strains isolated from pus, urine, urinary catheter and venous blood were categorized into Type 1 and more than 80% of strains isolated from choler and ascites were categorized into Type 1 or Type 3 (choler; Type 1 : Type 3 = 39.5% : 44.2%, ascites; Type 1 : Type 3 = 47.4% : 36.8%). In addition, the results of the comparison between genotype and the clinical department where the strains isolated has shown the statistically significant correlations. Moreover, the result of antimicrobial sensitivity, resistant to ampicillin, levofloxacin and minomycin was 69.2%, 67.9% and 30.8%, respectively. However, all isolates were sensitive to linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin. Furthermore, more than 90% of strains were categorized into Type 1, 2 and 4 were resistant to ampicillin and levofloxacin. Conclusion: These results clearly suggested the correlation of genotype and infection site of the E. faecium and need to be further analysis of detailed virulence/antimicrobial resistant genes in each genotype.",

We attempted to determine the pattern of Serogroups and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella infections in a regional teaching hospital during the period of November 2010 to December 2014. Methods: Children with Salmonella enterocolitis were retrospectively reviewed and epidemiology, age, sex, clinical manifestations, laboratory results were recorded between November, 2010 to December, 2014. The isolates and susceptibility of these Salmonella were carried out accordingly to standard microbiological methods. Results: Case records from 205 children were reviewed beteen November 2012 to December 2014. Of the 199 patients whose stool underwent complete testing for Salmonella Serogroup and the majotiry was D1 group (42%), then B group (39%), C1 (10.2%), D2 (5.9%) and C2 (1%). Eight stools (3.5%) tested positive for Salmonella and Rotavirus infections. Overall, 75.6% of cases were under three year of age, with 6.3% being younger than 1 years of age. Fever (95.5%), diarhea (87.4%), vomiting (25.6%) and bloody stool (15.1%) were the most common symptoms for Salmobella infections and abdominal pain (( p < 0.041)were associated with Salmonella Serogroup D1 (17%) and C1 (19%) infections. The resistance rates were 48.2%, 30.7%, 2.5%, 1.5%, and 2.5%, to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, cefixime and ciprofloxacin, respectively. The majority (98.5%) of CRP was elevated with 53.1% between 0.05 and 5 mg/dl, and 45.5% >5 mg/dl. The symptoms with Salmonella infection to admission was about 2.58 \u00b1 0.96 days and the average hospital date with Salmonella infections was 6.07 \u00b1 1.35 days. Conclusion: Salmonella gastroenteritis is the important causing pathogens in infants and children and 75.6% in our study was less than 3 years age. The prevalence of Salmonella Serogroup B decreased from 48% in 2007, 36.8% in 2010 and 39% in 2015 and Serogroup D2 (42%) was predominated in our study. 3.4% of our patients had co-infections with Rotavirus and Salmonella infections. Most of the salmonella serogroups isolated in this study were highly susceptible to the third cephalosporins (97.5%) while resistant to ampicillin (48.2%) and bactrin (30.7%). The rising resistant antimicrobial agents informed us the rational antibiotics uage and the importance of infection control. Background: There are many currently available epidemiologic strain typing methods including antibiogram, pulsed-filed gel electrophoresis, restricted fragment length polymorphism and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Among them, MLST is the most widely used method for the evaluation of clonality. MLST is an unambiguous procedure for characterizing isolates using pairwise sequence analysis of the internal fragments of seven housekeeping. However, major disadvantage of MLST is high-cost and labor-intensity. We designed Microsoft Excel-based macro system for the automated analysis of DNA sequences of seven housekeeping genes. Methods: Using excel-based macro, sequencing data were called to the spreadsheet as string-type text. Next, sequences with reverse primer were replaced with a complementary base sequence. Forward sequence and complementary base-replaced reverse sequence were assembled and aligned by matching 100-consecutive 20-identical sequences. Finally, assembled sequence were compared to the pre-built database constructed from online MLST database (http://www.mlst.net/databases/) to determine the type of allele. In case of non-typable allele, we manually checked through the online database. To evaluate the accuracy, we compared the result of our program with the result of pre-manually determined sequence typing. Results: We chose the fasta-format text files as the raw data which should be called to the spreadsheet for analysis. For process of the raw data calling, all the fasta files in the specified folder was automatically loaded, which takes most of the running time, however, is the main advantage of our program. The running-time of the whole process was 10 minutes per 50 strains, which is much faster than the manual typing method, which would generally take several hours. Comparing with the results of manual typing, concordance rate was 100%. All the non-typable alleles through our program were revealed as new allelic type when confirmed manually. Conclusion: MLST is a good method for epidemiologic evaluation, however, labor-intensity is the major disadvantage. We designed macro-based automated analysis, and the concordance rate with manual typing was excellent. Also, this program may prevent clerical error of manual typing. Excel-based macros can be used by anyone, and can be constructed through uncomplicated coding. This might be useful for the large scale epidemiologic studies.",

The nosocomial food contamination can cause various food-borne illnesses of patients and healthcare staff. The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) abrogated and amended the regulations about tableware in 2014. We examine whether the regulation is enough to monitor the food safety base on our experience about non-conformity in 2016. Methods: The surveillance was performed based on the standard \"Methods of test for food microorganisms-test of coli-form bacteria\" announced by MOHW in Taiwan. The lauryl tryptose broth (LST) and eosin-methylene blue (EMB) agar were used to measure the most probable number (MPN) of coli-form bacteria and Escherichia coli in tableware and meals.",

Klebsiella pneumonia was isolated from contaminated simultaneously tableware and meals through further identification. Thus, the infection control team-driven intervention was activated immediately to correct the procedure of tableware washing performed by subcontractor. We implement the condition with dry-heat 110\u00b0C for 30 min from food industry to disinfect the tableware. The surveillance was continued monitored to confirm the cleanness of reusable tableware. Conclusion: In summary, we identified the contaminated meals were resulted from inadequate tableware washing and improved abnormal procedure. We suggest that the regulation about pathogens isolated from reusable and disposable tableware should be considered and established in hospitals to improve the food safety of patients and healthcare staff.",

Background: According to TSN2013 guideline, dialysis water have to exam every month, and the reference range was lower than 200 CFU/mL. If the data was under 200 CFU/mL higher than 50 CFU/mL, clinical staff or engineer have to find the possible reason that caused the data higher than 50 CFU/mL. In this investigation, we report a situation that caused the data higher than 50 CFU/mL for two months. And after finding the possible origin, we did some change, then the result showed its useful that no cases present after the change. Methods: In this study, we drew a picture to check the possible site of the RO system. Otherwise, we collected 35 dialysis water from RO system. Then we used the TGEA agar as a culture media. After 168 hours incubated in 20\u00b0C, we check the colony count. Results: After incubated, we found the RO system's dialysis water were qualified, but the outlet of RO system's dialysis water was unqualified. Otherwise, we found all the unqualified water were cultured positive for fungus. The result showed the fungus belonged to Candida and Aspergillus. After checked the data, we tried to find possible source. Conclusion: Finally, we found all the positive culture site that something inside or something nearby the outlet.

In clinical, we suggested to use the disposable wipe for clean. And the chlorine solution had to over 500 ppm for terminal disinfection. Otherwise, we taught the cleaner the way to clean. So, in this study, we wanted to check if the environment still have Multi-drug resistant organisms after cleaning or not. Methods: In this study, we chose 41 beds 492 sites that contain MDRO before cleaning. Then we used the chromogenic agar as a culture media. After 48 hours incubated, we can check the bacteria growth or not. Finally we did the Antibiotic susceptibility test to check the MDRO still present or not. Results: After experiment, we found 21% (9/41) of bed that culture positive for MDRO. And the bacteria were Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (8/9) and Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacter cloacae (1/9). Most culture positive bed were from Medical Intensive Care Unit. Conclusion: According to this study, we did the education of the staff in Medical Intensive Care Unit. Besides that, we ask the cleaner used the disposable wipe every time. Then have to check the concentration of the chlorine solution before clean. Background: According to the chemotherapy bleach detection of the bacteria assessment SOP. After the environment is clean to perform a bacteria test. The culture dish needs to be left 1 hour and then sent to the laboratory culture. To facilitate environmental clean monitoring. But after the petri dish inspection, often more than the laboratory to work time. So for the evaluation of postharvest petri dish placed in the chemotherapy room until the next morning to the laboratory culture. And the original work manual implementation process is different. The traps are evaluated after the test feasibility of inspection for the next day. Methods: Each time the implementation of the bacteria test will be divided into the control group (immediately check after the colletion) each time 8 pieces, test group ( petri dish every other day checked) each time 8 pieces. Observe the results of training. The control group was tested on October 13, November 17, 2016 and January 5, February 23, March 9, April 13, 2017. The test group was on October 14, November 18, 2016. January 6, February 24, March 10 April 14, 2017 respectively implementation training. Results: In the chemotherapy room to blood agar plate (BAP, 90 mm) for 1 hour and the collection was complete sent to laboratory training. The control group was submitted six times (48 pieces of specimen). The test group submitted six times (48 pieces of specimen). Total of ninty-six samples no colonies were grown. The results of the control group and the test group were consistent ( Figure 1 ). Conclusion: From the experimental results that whether the postharvest petri dish is immediately sent to the bacterial chamber culture or after the inspection of the petri dish every other day. As long as the chemical deployment room environment clean thoroughly And colony culture dish inspection and disposal appropriate. Can get a good environment for the deployment of chemotherapy drugs.

Background: Environmental cleaning is a fundamental principle of infection control in healthcare settings. However, the comparative application methods and contamination assessment techniques is unknown, and no consensus exists around benchmarks for cleanliness. We sought to determine whether implement environment clean separation management measures in a medical intensive care unit (MICU) could reduce the density of healthcare associated infection. Methods: We performed a 4-month prospective cohort intervention study, August \u223c December 2013, at medical intensive care unit in a 700-bed tertiary care hospital. Following one month of preintervention phase, implementing education and training for all cleaning staff and related personnel to use environment clean separation management measures by using 4 different color disposable wipes to clean high tough surfaces. The cleaning staff was asked to use red wipe to clean the toilet door knobs, isolation room and waste room, yellow wipe to clean the patient's bedside, green wipe to clean the nursing station and meeting room, blue wipe to clean the procedure tables, refrigerator handle and water dispenser button. The cleaning effect of the MICU environment was measured by using ATP bioluminescence. Then the density of health-care associated infection of the MICU was monitored every month. Results: The ATP bioluminescence value <100 is determined as pass and >200 is determined as fail. Within the study period, the value of pass increase from 13% to 53%, the value of fail decrease from 47% to 20%; numerical difference trend of the pass value increase from \u22127% to 20% and fail value decrease from 13% to \u221220%, showing the use of different color disposable wipes and the correct wiping method or wiping process can improve the environment cleanliness. The density of health-care associated infection one month before the intervention phase is 12.8\u2030 and one month after the intervention phase is 12.6\u2030. Conclusion: Using environment clean separation management measures is effective in cleanliness of MICU environment. However, there is no decline of the density of health-care associated infection.",

            "text": "Experience sharing of improving surgical hand scrub water quality Chih Hao Tseng. Infection Control Office; Clinical Laboratory Department Background: According to 2006 New Hospital Accreditation: The Surgery and Anesthesia departments should regularly implement bacteriological examination, yet relevant literatures did not suggest regular inspections, and these inspections should be implemented only when associated epidemiology data was required to confirm outbreaks. However, in consideration of healthcare quality and patient safety, infection control (IC) team had routinely collected and cultured surgical hand scrub water samples from total 4 faucets in our operation room (OR) by IC technician every month. The results had been less than 50 cfu/ml. On Sep 23, 2015, the cultured result of 4 water samples showed abnormal increase: from 70 to over 200 cfu/ml Methods: IC team had discussed with OR head nurse and ruled out anthropic factors but we were not conscious of ultraviolet germicidal lamp (UVGL) factor. After further discussion with public works department, \"decay of UVGL\" was recognized as the primary cause of decreased germicidal efficacy. Improvement measures were subsequently developed and implemented as described below: (1) Check and wipe off the dust on the surface of UV lamp every week to avoid penetration reduction that might affect germicidal efficacy (executed by sanitary staff, and included the practice in the routine clean work). (2) Staffs should always be aware of the status of UVGL, and once UV system is in alarm, beeping, immediately report to the OR leader nurse to call the manufacturer. (3) Renew UVGL and filter cartridge every year and every six months, respectively, to ensure the germicidal ability. Results: The measures were taken and carried on. We follow up in the next 6 months and the water quality of all 4 faucets were normal (<50 cfu/ml). Conclusion: UV germicidal lamp is widely used for sterilization. It is generally thought that UVGL has sustained germicidal intensity until the lamp is full dimmed. Thus, decay of UVGL tends to be neglected in such case. In fact, its germicidal ability is associated with Irradiation intensity (I) and Time (T). Therefore, the dust and grease on the surface of UV lamp may reduce penetration and germicidal efficacy. Hopefully, the experience sharing can remind IC healthcare workers of the link between decay of UV lamp and incomplete sterilization that is closely related to patient safety.",

We examined the effectiveness of a mobile, automatic device, Hyper Light Disinfection Robot (model: Hyper Light P3), which utilized ultraviolet-C (UV-C) (254 nm) to kill clinical strains of MDR-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MDR-Acinetobacter baumannii, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), ATCC strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Mycobacterium abscessus and Aspergillus fumigatus in experimental setting. The device was wheeled into different strategic position that was 1 meter from the agar plate. Then, the device was wheeled to a distance of 2 and 3 meters from other sets of agar plates with the same number of colonies, respectively. The above experiments were repeated with 5, 10 and 15 minutes of exposure time. The performance of this device in disinfecting three hospital rooms previously admitted by patients harboring MRSA and VRE was also assessed. Results: In vitro, more than 3 log 10 reduction of vegetative bacteria colonies was observed after UV-C irradiation of 5 minutes at a distance of 3 meters from the device, except for VRE and M. abscessus. At the distance of 1 meter, substantial and comparable reduction of colonies was observed across all tested bacteria regardless of exposure time. The killing effect was less pronounced for A. fumigatus particularly at the distance of 2-3 meters. In uncleaned hospital rooms, there was significant reduction in the number of bacteria colonies sampled from different surfaces after UV-C irradiation for 15 minutes (24 hours incubation: 35 CFUs vs 0 CFUs, p= 0.0005; 48 hours incubation: 165 CFUs vs. 0 CFUs, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The Hyper Light P3 device was effective in killing MDR pathogens and could be considered as an adjunctive method in disinfecting hospital environment.",

The outlet swab positive rate was 40% for both control and test group. The most common isolated microorganisms were E-coli, Enterococcus spp. Conclusion: Disinfection of urinary drainage bag outlet with alcohol swab after each opening is not found to be useful in this small group of patients. Background: Observation and feedback is a core strategy for hand hygiene (HH) improvement. Direct overt observation is currently the most common method to monitor HH. Observation bias, also known as the Hawthorne effect, was one major disadvantage of the method. Although the magnitude of the Hawthorne effect has been described in several studies, subgroup analysis of the Hawthorne effect has not been clear yet. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital during a 15-month period. The HH overt observation results were matched for category, department, observation time and location with those observed covertly at a ratio of 1:1. The matched pairs were then analyzed for the Hawthorne effect by different variable. Results: Among the study period, a total of 31,522 HH opportunities were observed (4581 by overt observation, 26,941 by covert observation). There were 3047 matched pairs after 1:1 case control matching. The overall HH compliance by overt and covert observation was 78.2% and 54.6%, respectively (the overall Hawthorne effect 23.6%). The Hawthorne effect in nurses (30.0%) was almost three times as large as that in physicians (10.5%), and tended to be more obvious in outpatient clinic (40.6%) than in the intensive care units (11.4%). Further analysis revealed the Hawthorne effect was significantly different between by categories of healthcare workers and observation location (p value both <0.001), but not different by department, observation time, and HH indications. Conclusion: The heterogenicity of the Hawthorne effect in hand hygiene may influence the interpretation of overt observation results. We suggest covert observation be performed at least once in health facilities in which HH observation are routine. Realizing the heterogenicity of the Hawthorne effect may help identify target population with lower HH compliance.",

Infection Control Unit, Cheng Ching Hospital Background: There were twenty staffs attending a staff trip to Yilan on 6-7 January, 2016. The symptoms of vomiting or diarrhea were found continually in some staffs. The clusters of diarrhea were assumed and we reported to the Department of Health, Taichung City Government. The investigation and samples collection were implemented soon and we also educated the staff to keep caution to avoid spreading. Methods: There were twenty staffs attending a staff trip to Yilan on 6-7 January, 2016. They had lunch on the second day at a seafood restaurant in Gonglian and sashimi was served. There were three staffs suffered from vomiting and diarrhes on 8 January, 2016. We reported to our trade union of welfare, and the Department of Health, Taichuny City Government as diarrhea clusters. There were eleven staffs suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms and one staff even resulted in hospitalization until 14 January, 2016. All the eleven staff received examination of stool bacterial culture and three stool samples were sent to the laboratory of Centers for Disease Control. Our implementing measures are as followings: (1) Educate the staff with symptoms should keep aerosol and contact isolation, rest at home. (2) The other staff who took care of these patients should wear masks and keep hand hygiene. (3) The environment that the patients worked should enhance cleansing. (4) Watch out for the possible symptoms of infection and informed infection control department. Results: All three stool samples revealed Norovirus infection. Conclusion: Norovirusis a very contagious virus, it can live in stool or vomitus for a long time. The virus is transmitted by fecally contaminated food or water, by person-to-person contact, and via aerosoli zation of vomited virus and subsequent contamination of surfaces. Norovirus is rapidly in activated by either sufficient heating or by chlorine-based disinfectants and polyquaternary amines, but the virus is less susceptible to alcohols and detergents. Early implementation is helpful and important to prevent spreading. We hoped to share this special experience to prevent possible clusters and save the resources and costs.",

Infection control strategies are implemented to prevent cross and cluster infection among patients, visitors, and health professionals. Methods: The infection control strategies were conducted in the year of 2016. The strategies include four aspects. (1) Patient and their family: The poster was posted to remind individuals suffering from fever, cough, and cold should wear a mask, or educate them not to visit. The knowledge of hand hygiene and mask was promoted through patient group education session monthly and family forums every two month. Chest X-ray was performed for each inpatient. (2) Health professionals: The staff should take three-hour lessons to strengthen his or her knowledge regarding infection control and reporting system. The unit audited staff's compliance with hand washing to reinforce practice and develop good habits. Each staff checked own body temperature (BT). The staff should be arranged off if his or her BT is above 37.5. The staff could on duty after no fever for 24 hours. The unit also evaluated the infection signs and symptoms of inpatients who were implemented an intrusive cauterization. Validity period of all healthcare products should be examined. Staff should take at least one-hour lesson of needlestick and sharps injuries prevention yearly; new staff should complete this course in three months. One registered nurse (RN) was assigned to be responsible for infection control; another acted as an infection control consultation liaison RN. They were responsible for monitoring safety use of healthcare products and reporting suspected cases. (3) Equipment: Hand sanitizer was provided at fixed places. The gate of the unit was equipped a vending machine for masks. If there was diarrhea or vomiting, it is important to strengthen environment clean and disinfection. (4) Suspected cases: The suspected patients should be held on isolated rooms in order to decrease contact with others. Related library tests or examinations should be followed up.",

Background: To promote the quality of care for central venous catheters (CVCs) and reduce the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections, a CVC bundle intervenion program was implemented in the electronic health management system in 2012. In order to understand the staffs' cognition, attitude and behavior for CVC bundle care program, an investigation with questionnaire was underwent in July, 2016. Methods: The staff members, including doctos and nurses of 54bed medical intensive care units (ICUs), were invited to annyomously fill out the questionnaire for CVC bundle culture awareness. The itmes incldued in the study questionnaire were based on the Taiwan CDC guideline for CVC bundle care, which addressed the critical procedures for CVC placement and care. The study was ethically approved by The Institutional Review Borad of National Cheng Kung University Hospital (IRB no.: B-ER-105-82). Results: A total of 138 members (128 nurses and 10 doctors) of medical ICUs participated this study. The average year of service of the nurses was 5.1 years. Most of the study subjects (123, 89.1%) admitted \"catheter-related bloodstream infections is zero-tolerance.\" All of them agreed \"the doctors should evaluate the necessity of catheter for patient every day.\" The majority (116, 84.1%) of the participants agreed that CVC must be removed within 48 h, if it was inserted in an emergent situation. In addition, a significant proportion (83, 60.1%) ever proposed removal of CVC catheters inserted in such situations. Major contributing factors for catheter-releated bloodstream infections recognized by our colleagues included critical patients who need multiple venous lines for treatment (n = 42), overt bleeding during the process of CVC placement, prolonged procedure time (n = 23), incomplete disinfection of CVC conector (n = 34), and patients with multiple chronic diseases (n = 30). However, 63.8% of the respondents conisdered that the bunde care would increase their work load. Most of the study subjects (108, 78.3%) admitted the bundle program would fail, if the practioners did not take it seriously. Conclusion: All respondents recognized CVC bundle care program would reduce the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections. However, most of the practitioners worried that heavy workload would be an obstacle to practice the bundle care.",

Background: Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is a ubiquitous pathogen that could be found in clinical environment and equipment surfaces. E. meningoseptica had the nature characteristics of resistant to various antimicrobial agents, such as carbapenem. Increasing frequency of human infection, especially from healthcare associated infections, had been reported in recent decade. However, efforts of infection control of outbreak caused by E. meningoseptica remains less reported. Methods: The Respiratory Care Center (RCC) at the National Taiwan University Hospital is a 15-bed unit which provides care for ventilator-dependent patients. During October 2016 to November 2016, 3 patients developed bacteremia due to E. meningoseptica during the stay at RCC, which was significantly higher comparing to background incidence. All three isolates had identical antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. An environmental investigation and infection control measures of outbreak, such as strict hand hygiene, contact isolation and environmental cleaning were conducted. Molecular typing by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to investigate the relatedness of isolates and isolates with more than 90% of similarity were considered the same cluster. Results: In the investigation of outbreak, eight clinical isolates were cultured from six patients, including 6 isolates from blood and two isolate from sputum. Two additional isolates were cultured from the hospital environment. PFGE of the 10 isolates revealed three different clusters, including three, three and two isolates in each cluster. A blood isolate from one patient was identical to one of the isolates from the medical environment (Cluster 3, Figure 1 ). There was no linkage to the environmental isolates of the other two clusters indicate the possibility of cross transmission by healthcare personnel (Cluster 1 and 2, Figure 1 ). After use of strict cohort nursing, hand hygiene and environmental cleaning, the outbreak was controlled. Conclusion: We reported the investigation of an E. meningoseptica outbreak at the RCC of a medical center in Taiwan. Our results demonstrate potential transmission of E. meningoseptica via medical environment and person-to-person contact. Vigorous infection control measures should be applied to prevent spreading of E. meningoseptica at hospitals.",

Ninety percent of the healthcare-associated pneumonia in the intensive care unit were ventilator-associated pneumonia. Compared with pneumonia which are not ventilator-associated, the risk of using ventilators gets six to twenty times higher than patients not using ventilators. Each ventilator-associated pneumonia was estimated to increase by 19.2 days of the length of hospital stay and US$5,335 of the cost in Taiwan. To prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia and improve the quality of medical care, we launched a campaign to promote the care bundle of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Methods: We implemented many strategies to promote the care bundle of ventilator-associated pneumonia from June 2015 to December 2016. The daily checklist was developed for five elements, including elevation of the head of the bed to at least 30 degrees, daily sedation vacation, daily assessment of readiness to extubation, mouth care with 0.2% chlorhexidine and emptying the water from the tubing of ventilators. Furthermore, we educated the healthcare workers and monitored the compliance with care bundle. Results: Compared to the data in 2015, after introducing the care bundle of ventilator-associated pneumonia in 2016, the infection rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia reduced from 2.31 to 0.86 per 1000 ventilator days. The utilization rates of ventilators decreased from 28.98 to 26.80 per 100 resident days. The compliance rate of care bundle increased from 80% to 95%. By the decrease of ventilator-associated pneumonia from 32 to 14 each year, we saved medical cost about US$ 100,000 each year. Conclusion: There are many benefits to adopted care bundle, including improving the quality of medical care for the hospitals, avoiding suffering from infections for patients and reducing medical cost for social insurance.",

SSI will increase hospital days, mortality, medical costs and the workload of staff. The prevention of healthcare-associated infections have always been the important topic of medical institutions. The incidence of mastectomy-related SSI increased from Nov. 2016 at a medical center. An outbreak investigation and some relevant interventions were conducted. Methods: In recent four years, the incidence of mastectomyrelated SSI at the medical center ranges from 0.1 to 0.2%. An active surveillance by infection control nurse found that the SSI incidence increased since Aug., Sep., and Nov. 2016, and even went higher in Dec. 2016 and Jan. 2017. Outbreak was therefore suspected. In order to realize the cause for the unusually increased SSI, an outbreak investigation was conducted to analyze the probable factors, including staff's daily work, environment and equipment cleaning, the operation procedures, and post-operation wound care processes.",

CAUTIs result in significant morbidity, mortality, and medical cost. This prompted us to investigate the impact of infection control measures, such as CAUTI bundle care. Bundle care has been proven to effectively reduce CAUTI in many literatures. Well-structured infection control programs are imperative in order to the prevent CAUTI. Methods: Prospective surveillance was performed on all patients admitted to the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). All patients developing healthcare-associated uninary tract infection (HAUTI), including CAUTI while their staying at NTUH during 2008 to 2016 were enrolled for analysis. A CAUTI bundle care was implemented in the entire hospital, particular focus on ICUs, since 2010. The bundle care emphasized 4C elements: clean practice, clean products, clean equipment, and clean environment. A comprehensive educational program including optimization of the catheterization process, demonstrating by teaching videos for learning purposes, clinical audit, Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) for nurses and interns, and competitions to test the operators' practical knowledge and skills was also conducted at the same time. A computer-based infection surveillance system and checklist was also developed to monitor the adherence to the CAUTI bundle care. The outcomes were analyzed on Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significantly. Results: During the study period, there were 6557,971 patient-days with a total of 9845 episodes of HAUTIs in the entire hospital identified. CAUTIs accounts for about 56.7% of HAUTIs. Among them, 1922 episodes of CAUTIs were assessed in 620,019 patientdays over 353,609 catheter-days in adult ICU. Comparing the incidence density of CAUTI in adult ICU patients before and after the implementation of bundle interventions, CAUTI incidence density remarkably decreased from 7.9 to 4.8 per 1000 patient-days ( p = 0.02). Foley utilization was seen significantly decreased, from 1148.5 catheter-days to 956.1 catheter-days ( p = 0.028) monthly between the pre-CAUTI and post-CAUTI bundle care. Conclusion: CAUTI incidence density decreased in response to the implementation of an effective bundle care intervention. Multidisciplinary teamwork, education, a comprehensive checklist and from time to time audit feedback to improve healthcare workers' compliance are the keys to success.",

It remains unclear whether daily bathing with 2% chlorhexidine can reduce the risk. The aim of this study is to compare the incidence of healthcare-associated bloodstream infection (HABSI) between patients using of 2% CHG daily bath and those using general antibacterial cleansers daily bath. Methods: This was a single-arm prospective interventional study. Patients admitted to two hematological units during the period from December 2015 to June 2016 were the study population. We recruited patients to receive 2% CHG daily bath (intervention group). Those who refused to participate were provided with general antibacterial cleansers daily bath (control group). The incidence rate of skin flora-related bloodstream infection (SKIN_BSI), central venous catheter (CVC)-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI_CVC), and HABSI of the intervention group were compared with that of the control group. Results: In total, 485 patients were enrolled as the intervention group, and the other 408 patients served as control group. Compared with the control group, the incidence rate of first SKIN_BSI was reduced by 65.5% (1.0 vs 2.9 per 1000 patient-day, p = 0.012), the incidence rate of first CLABSI_CVC was reduced by 61% (6.6 vs 16.9 per 1000 patient-day, P = 0.005) and the incidence rate of first HABSI was reduced by 34.2% (7.9 vs 12.0 per 1000 patientday, P = 0.042) in the intervention group. After adjusting for effects of confounding variables by logistic regression, the 2% CHG daily bath reduces the risk of first SKIN_BSI by 70% (adjusted OR = 0.3, P = 0.02), the risk of first CLABSI_CVC by 68% (adjusted OR = 0.32, P = 0.01), and the risk of first HABSI by 59% (adjusted OR = 0.41, P = 0.002). In contrast, the risk of gut-origin bacteremia, such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae-related bloodstream infection, did not change (adjusted OR = 0.993, P = 0.99). Conclusion: Daily bathing with 2% CHG is effective in reducing skin flora-related bloodstream infection and cathether-related bacteremia. We recommend routine adoption of this simple and low-cost intervention to reduce BSI among patients with hematological malignancy.",

We used Fisher's exact test and found there's significance ( p < 0.05). Infection control team immediately responded and investigated environmental survey, the relevant infection control measures was also initiated. Methods: In our hospital, orthopedic department has a total of 35 patients underwent arthroscopic surgery in October 2016. Infection control nurses reviewed daily bacteriologic reports and medical records routinely. We have surveyed doctor and nurses with total of seven nasal swabs and hand specimens before and after hand scrub to identify the source of pathogen, including carrier and colonizer. All the pathogen specimen will compare with RAPD (Random amplified polymorphic DNA) to reconstruct ribonucleic acid and to distinguish whether the strains were identical. Results: We found all 3 infected patients received their surgery on October 3. The causative pathogen is S. aureus. Thirty nine of the environmental specimens were negative for S. aureus. Three of seven staffs have been found S. aureus in the nasal cavity. Two circulating nurses showed positive identification of S. aureus before and after they had scrubbing their hands. We conducted RAPD Analysis Typing for the pathogens and found that all patient's pathogens and pathogens from 2 circulating nurse were identical. The outbreak of surgical site infection has been confirmed. Conclusion: During investigation, we found that the circulating nurse was not required to wear gloves. Furthermore, we have confirmed S. aureus moved from the nurse's hands to surgical site, because of ineffective clean process while the nurses has severe eczematous skin lesion in her hands. After group meetings and discussions, we have revised the process for circulating nurse, which including hand hygiene and personal protective equipment. From November 2016 to May 2017, there was no more S. aureus surgical site infection. It can be well explained that our efforts for this outbreak are effective and successful.",

According to the 2016 nosocomial infection records provided by the Infection Control Center of Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, the infection density of CAUTIs in MICU was elevated to 4.17\u2030 and medical costs increased. Therefore, the collaboration practice team assembled from Infection Control Center and Center of Quality Management promote the bundle care intervention. Methods: The collaborating team surveyed the bundle care intervention through brainstorming and cause-and-effect analysis. After reviewing literatures, the team investigated the current states of indwelling catheter implementation of three aspects: the \"care knowledge,\" \"placement,\" and \"care checklist.\" Different understandings of the bundle care process were survey for medical team. The completion rate of accurate catheter care calculated from nursing team scoring. Daily evaluation instruments for catheter placement and care investigated. Finally, the team invited external infection control experts to MICU for intervention measures of bundle care implementation, standards of the placement and daily care, professional training sessions, instructional films for placement, daily care for patients, and a digitized platform for daily care evaluation. The team expected that these measures would alleviate the CAUTI rate. Results: The research team enhanced health care professionals' knowledge of bundle care intervention for CAUTI through revised standard operating procedures of indwelling catheter placement and care, lecture instructions, and self-learning via instructional films. Furthermore, this study ensured accurate implementation through an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), group discussions, and subsequent audits.

Department of Nursing, Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) commonly occurs in intensive care unit patients who have a tracheal tube. In Taiwan, approximately 13.7-25.3% of hospitalized patients contract VAP, which has a mortality rate of 20-33%. Hospital infection control center reported the VAP infection rate in our medical intensive care units was 1.17\u2030 in 2015, which was higher than the nationwide in medical centers (0.6\u2030) and which has steadily increased. Accordingly, hospitalization days and medical costs in Taiwan have risen. For this study, we collaborated with the infection control center, respiratory therapist team, information management center, and medical quality management center to develop and implement a bundle care intervention to reduce the VAP infection rate. Methods: A medical intensive care unit that has 45 patient beds and which averages a 96.4% occupancy rate was adopted for this study. Through cross-team cooperation and brainstorming, we analyzed several crucial factors related to VAP, and developed a VAP bundle care scale by referring to previous studies for investigating medical employees' knowledge of VAP bundle care procedures. The results showed that their knowledge varied, and that they did not adopt consistent care standards or have adequate daily assessment tools. In response, we invited external infection control experts to train hospital medical personnel on how to provide bundle care, modify daily VAP care standards (e.g., raising bedhead to 30\u00b0-45\u00b0, adopting daily sedation cessation, using 0.2-0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for oral care, draining ventilators water, and washing hands), provide training, develop a daily care assessment form, and establish an information sharing platform. Results: In this study, we modified VAP bundle care standards and the medical team enhanced their knowledge of VAP bundle care through classroom learning and digital training videos. Through visual management and reminders from an information system, the accuracy of the VAP bundle care increased from 44.6% to 95.9%. Moreover, the VAP infection rate reduced from 1.17\u2030 to 0.44\u2030. We found that when bedheads were raised to 30\u00b0-45\u00b0, alert conscious patients could not fall asleep and experienced sacrum pain; accordingly, these patients refused this care procedure.",

Background: According to previous studies, there were many evidences suggested that bundle care can reduce healthcare related infection effectively. However, clinical staff didn't know the meaning of bundle care clearly and didn't obey the measures well. That's why we implemented ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) bundle care since June 1, 2015 to now. In the beginning, the accuracy of bundle care was only 76.6%, which may cause in low compliance rates of bundle care. Compliance rates of VAP were merely 57.1% respectively. The lack of recognition can affect the compliance of performing the measures. Methods: The VAP bundle care intervention include: head-of-bed elevation above 30 degrees, twice \"oral hygiene\" for patients daily, patency control on ventilator circuit, daily assessment of sedation cessation, hand hygiene, and evaluation ventilator need for patients every single day. We made up a special group that led by our assistant administrator. After observation of promotion to bundle care in clinical unit, we found that most of clinical staffs were poor recognition about bundle care and were not wellknowing in the measures. We elaborated corrective measures, including holding education training activity and bench-marking, instituting bundle care checklist and demonstration, hold \"King of Knowledge\" responder game, making informational materials for promotion and carrying out examination seriously to promote bundle care smoothly.",

Results: Thirteen SCCmec type III isolates with a cefazolin MIC of \u2265128 \u00b5g/mL were classified as the high-cefazolin MIC (HCM) group, whereas 13 SCCmec type IV and 8 SCCmec type V isolates were classified as the low-cefazolin MIC (LCM) group. With the checkerboard method, synergism was present for vancomycinbased combinations at 30.8-69.2 and 13.6-66.7%, as well as teicoplanin-based combinations of 38.5-84.6 and 0-47.6%, of the HCM and LCM isolates, respectively. No antagonism was noted. The in vitro inhibitory activity was evident even at a low concentration of 1/512x MIC of cephalosporin combined with sub-inhibitory concentrations (1/2x MIC) of a glycopeptide. With time-killing assays, synergism was noted at 1/2x or 1x susceptible breakpoint concentrations (SBCs) of a cephalosporin combined with 1/4 or 1/2 MIC of a glycopeptide. In the presence of 1/2 SBC of a cephalosporin, vancomycin or teicoplanin MICs decreased an average of 2.0-to 6.6-or 1.6-to 5.5-fold, respectively. With 8 \u00b5g/ mL cephalosporin, the decline of glycopeptide MICs was most obvious in the presence of cefmetazole. Conclusion: Cephalosporin-glycopeptide combinations at clinically achievable concentrations can exhibit in vitro synergistic antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates. Such combinations require more clinical data to support their application for use in human MRSA infections.",

Background: This study was performed to assess the in vitro activity of cefoperazone alone and different cefoperazonesulbactam ratios against different inoculum sizes of ESBL-E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefoperazone, cefoperazone-sulbactam at fixed ratio of 1:1 and 2:1 against a normal inoculum size of 5 \u00d7 10 5 CFU/mL CFU/mL and a high inoculum size of 5 \u00d7 10 7 CFU/mL CFU/mL were measured. Results: After the addition of sulbactam at a 1:1 ratio, most MIC 50 and MIC 90 values decreased. The susceptibility rate of cefoperazone-sulbactam at a 1:1 ratio is greater against most organisms, except P. aeruginosa; for P. aeruginosa, the susceptibility rate of cefoperazone-sulbactam was at a 2:1 ratio. For extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli, the susceptibility rate of cefoperazonesulbactam at ratios of (1:1) and (2:1) decreased from 97.0 to 87.9% and 90.9 to 60.6%, for normal to high inoculum, respectively. For ESBL K. pneumoniae, both susceptibility rate of cefoperazonesulbactam at ratios of (1:1) and (2:1) decreased from 75.8%, and 63.6% at normal inoculum to 51.5% and 42.4% at high inoculum. Conclusion: Cefoperazone-sulbactam at a 1:1 ratio has greater in vitro activity against most multidrug resistant organisms than cefoperazone-sulbactam at a 2:1 ratio. Such combinations were not influenced by the inoculum size of ESBL E. coli and K. pneumoniae and could be a therapeutic option for treating severe infections.",

Background: In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical experience of patients receiving doripenem-containing regimens for the treatment of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in a tertiary care center and assessed the clinical usefulness of doripenem therapy in this clinical setting. Methods: In this retrospective study, the medical records of all adult patients who had ever received doripenem-containing therapy for the treatment of HCAIs were reviewed between September 1, 2012 and August 31, 2014, and the following data were extracted: age, gender, type of infection, disease severity, underlying comorbidities or conditions, and laboratory results. Additionally, we also extracted data regarding the rates of mortality and clinical and microbiological response. Results: A total of 184 adult patients with HCAIs who had received doripenem-containing therapy were included in this study. Respiratory tract infections (n = 91, 49.5%) were the most common type of infection, followed by urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections. The mean APACHE II score was 14.5. The rate of clinical success was 78.2%, and the overall in-hospital mortality rate was only 13.0%. Among patients, in-hospital mortality was independently and significantly associated with APACHE II score (odds ratio (OR), 1.2825; 95% CI, 1.1123 \u00b1 1.4788) and achieving clinical success (OR, 0.003; 95% CI, 0.0003 \u00b1 0.409). Conclusion: The overall in-hospital mortality rate was low and the clinical success rate was high among HCAI patients receiving doripenem treatment.

Background: Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) is one of the most common health care associated infection. The most imprtant risk factor for development of CAUTI is prolonged use of a urinary catheter. Active surveillance and infection control are needed to disclose in each hospital and to deal with this problem effectively. Methods: Prospective surveillance was conducted according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) procedures at a major teaching hospital from 2013 through 2016. Fisher's exact probability test and Kruskal-Wallis test ware performed. Results: During the study period, 3,229,898 patient-days and 659,165 catheter-days were evaluated, and 2,144 CAUTI occurred. The overall rate of CAUTI was 3.25 per 1000 catheter-days. The mean age of 71 \u00b1 19 years, and female gender accounted for 44.8%. The length of hospital stay was 75 (1-105) days in median.

We use web services techniques based on Service-Oriented Architecture, which are suitable for integrating heterogeneous platforms, protocols, and applications. Results: Provider of Quality Indicator: During study period, 269 episodes of ICP-detected HAUTIs and 325 episodes of computerdetected HAUTIs were found throughout the 20 departments. The correlation of HAI events counted with and without the HAUTI surveillance system in different department is displayed. The square of the sample correlation coefficient was 0.995 (by departments) and 0.958 (by weeks). Accuracy of the Detection Rule: A total of 396 episodes were verified during June 1, 2015 and November 30, 2015. The episodes of computer-detected HAUTIs correlated closely with the infection control personnel detected (P < 0.001). Compared with reference standards, this system performed excellently with regard to sensitivity (84.89%), specificity (99.87%), positive predictive value (93.65%), and negative predictive value (99.65%).

From the control chart was not difficult to find that SSI (0.92%) had exceeded 2 times the standard deviation of the control chart in July. The department of neurosurgery had 177 knife times (7th of the all surgical numbers). There were 87 knife times in No. 2 operating room and 47 knife times in No. 9 operating room in the majority, the rest operating rooms only 43 knive times. In No. 2 operating room SSI was 6 cases and In No. 9 operating room SSI was 5 cases, other operating rooms were without infection. Based on the chisquare test, the event of SSI was not significant with construction work of operating room (P = 0.2570, >\u03b1 = 0.05). Results: Definition from the Taiwan CDC 2009 edition healthcareassociated infection surveillance, SSI's follow-up survey is divided into implants and no implants.

Background: The incidence of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) related healthcare-associated infection (HAI) has increased in recent year worldwide. This study is to investigated the risk factor of CRPA infections in a universityaffiliated teaching hospital in Taiwan in order to provide more information under the current infection control system. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study included P. aeruginosa HAIs events from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2014, and divided to CRPA infected case group and carbapenem-susceptible P. aeruginosa (CSPA) infected reference group. The medical records were collected to identify risk factors for CRPA HAI and mortality. Patients with prior use of any anti-pseudomonal carbapenems were included in subgroup analysis. Results: 395 P. aeruginosa infection case enrolled from total 3,263 HAI events; 63were CRPA and 332 were CSPA. The prevalence of CRPA was 15.9% (63/395). A significant risk factor related to CRPA infection were longer time at risk, prior use of anti-pseudomonal carbapenems, and prior use of aminoglycoside ( p < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.05). Besides, anti-pseudomonal carbapenem monotherapy did not significantly increase risk for CRPA infection. Conclusion: CRPA prevalence tended to be elevated worldwide as well as in Taiwan. Antimicrobials use should be monitored carefully, especially carbapenems and aminoglycoside. Further study on bigger population with carbapenems use would be needed to confirm the association between using carbapenems in monotherapy and the risk to get CRPA infections.",

The aim of this study was to reduce the incidence of CAUTI by the introduction of bundle care. Methods: A total of 49 beds when placed with indwelling catheter were study from a general medical ward of Taiwan regional hospital. From January to May 2017, we recruited and analyzed 69 cases who received CAUTI bundle care. The CAUTI bundle care included 4 components. First, avoid unnecessary urinary catheter in situ, and check for clinical indications. Second, prior to every catheter care procedure, perform hand hygiene and then wear gloves and apron. Third, maintain the quality of urinary catheter, including regularly empty urinary drainage bags into a clean container, and urinary drainage bags should be placed lower than the bladder level but not on the floor. Lastly, the physician checked the necessity of using catheter every day, and the catheter was removed as soon as possible if not required. In addition, an internal audit team led by the chief physician of the ward conducted internal audits monthly using a table specifically designed for CAUTI bundle bare, and provided feedback to the ward. Our project team had regular meetings to check the compliance of the intervention plan and important index of the results of the review to improve. Results: The compliance rate of CAUTI bundle care increased from 66.7% in the beginning to 80%. Based on 20.44% of urinary catheter utilization rate, the incidence of CAUTI improved from 1.38\u2030 in 2016 to zero infection during the 5 months in 2017. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the catheter-associated urinary tract infections can be effectively reduced through the implementation of CAUTI bundle bare coupled with the establishment of the management organizational system.",

So the aim of this project was to upgrade knowledge, improve the compliance rate and the correctness of bundle care, and reduce the infection rate for the patients in our unit. Methods: The project was established on January 2017. A previous evaluation on our unit found that the compliance rate of VAP bundle care intervention of nursing care was 70.6% and care correctness was only 78.0%. The causes of the low compliance rate for bundle care and low care correctness were: lack of recognition by the nurses, lack of remind system on daily assessment for patient, lack of standard care guidelines for Mouth care, the lack of standard to make sure the correct elevation of the head of the bed. For these shortcomings, we (1). conducted education and elearning programs about VAP bundle care, (2) . developed a remind system on medical operating system for VAP bundle daily assessment, (3) . established the standard care guidelines for mouth care and for checking the correct elevation of the head of the bed. Results: After implementing our intervention, we found the project effectively improved the compliance rate of VAP bundle care intervention of nursing care(from 70.6% to 96.0%), increased the care correctness (from 78.0% to 97.4%), upgraded the knowledge about VAP bundle care in our nursing staff (from 71.6 to 96.6 points). The ventilator associated-pneumonia infection rate decreased and reached zero tolerance from February to April in 2017. Conclusion: With effective implementation, the ventilator associated-pneumonia infection risks can be lowered, mortality and days of hospitalization reduced, protecting patients from disease and ensuring patient safety.",

Background: Enterobacteriae is the most important pathogen of urinary tract infection. It is an international serious problem as regarding the antimicrobial resistant strains in the healthcare system. For these, the medical personnel keep going to reduce healthcare associated urinary tract infection in medical institutions. Once the cluster infection develops, it is difficult to estimate the further harm and impact. In March 2016, Infection Control Center in our hospital found several events of urinary tract infection with Citrobacter koseri in respiratory care ward through the microbiology laboratory daily report. For the case number was above the mean threshold, we initiated the outbreak investigation. Methods: We collected the information according to the clinic observation, laboratory result and medical recording in the past half year retrospectively. Furthermore, we performed 10 items environmental test, such as ward ground, drainage hole, shifting plate,bathing bed, shared shampoo and bath gel. Results: Three urinary specimens and one blood culture in three patients with Foley catheter revealed Citrobacter koseri with similar antimicrobial susceptibility testing in Feb and March, 2016. Six patients with Citrobacter koseri infection from Sep, 2015 to Jan, 2016 developed sporadically. Besides, environmental sample culture reported Citrobacter koseri in bathing bed, shared shampoo and subpacking bath gel, also. Intervention of infection control measure and education for caregivers were performed immediately. Shampoo and bath gel without re-using of empty bottles were applied individually. With bathing, the drainage system of Foley catheter must be shut down temporarily to avoid the countercurrent urine related infection. Besides, we emphasized principle and infection control policy of respiratory care ward about equipment, environment and daily care in personnel training. No more Citrobacter koseri related infection was reported and followed environmental tests revealed negative result till now. Conclusion: Enterobacteriae induced outbreak of urinary tract infection in the healthcare system is a notified issue. In this presentation, our experience about outbreak of Citrobacter koseri related urinary tract infection after bed bath was rare to be mentioned before.

Not much is known about tigecycline resistance in CNS. This study is aimed to exploring tigecycline resistance in CNS from central Taiwan. Methods: Totally 311 isolates of CNS were collected from Central Laboratory of the Central Region Hospital Alliance. The speciation was performed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Tigecycline susceptibility was determined using both Vitek 2 and broth microdilution methods. Interpretation was done according to the EUCAST standard. Results: By gene sequencing, the most prevalent three species were found to be Staphylococcus epidermidis (108 isolates), Staphylococcus capitis (68 isolates), and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (38 isolates). The tigecycline resistance rate using Vitek 2 and broth microdilution methods was 6.4% and 1.6%, respectively. The MIC consistency (within one doubling dilution) rate among the 311 isolates was 91.0%. The consistency rates of S. epidermidis, S. capitis, and S. haemolyticus were 90.7%, 88.2%, and 84.2%, respectively. In S. haemolyticus, 9 isolates (23.7%) were interpreted as susceptible using broth microdilution method, however, they were regarded as resistant by Vitek 2 method. Conclusion: Tigecycline resistance toward CNS from central Taiwan was first revealed. The inconsistency MIC using commercial Vitek 2 method and standard broth microdilution method, especially in S. haemolyticus, deserves continuous study. Background: The goal of this performance improvement study was to evaluate the effect of a targeted intervention to decrease catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and urinary catheter utilization by implementing quality improvement initiatives. Methods: CAUTI rates and urinary catheter utilization between 2013 and 2016 were calculated from 4 adult intensive care units. The intervention study was conducted over a period of 12 months. During a pre-intervention phase, the base line catheter associated CAUTI incidence rates were determined and compared with the incidence rates during the post-intervention phase. The compliance of health care staff with urinary catheter bundle elements was also measured. The implemented CAUTI prevention bundle that included: setting clear expectations for indications for indwelling urinary catheter use (an indwelling catheter policy which included criteria for catheter use); catheter insertion using aseptic technique and sterile equipment; acatheter maintenance; hand hygiene; documentation of catheter placement); daily assessment of the continued need for indwelling urinary catheter by physician; audit of checklists, checking insertion procedures and reviewing with supervisors were done by a multidisciplinary team once a fortnight. Results: During the study period, 108 of the 6650 patients were diagnosed with a CAUTI. There was a statistically significant reduction in the rate of CAUTI in ICUs, from 3.3 per 1,000 catheter-days (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.1) before the intervention to 2.6 per 1,000 catheter-days (95% CI, 1.1-1.6; P <.05) after the intervention. The urinary catheter use rate decreased from 64.6% (95% CI, 60.9%-73.4%) at baseline to 52.2% (95% CI, 46.3%-58.1%; P = 0.09). The compliance rate of the ICU nurses to the bundle elements was raised to 100% during the last 6 months of the post intervention phase. Conclusion: Increased compliance to recommended catheter associated urinary tract infections preventive practices reduced the incidence of CAUTI in ICU units. It is simple and effective and is recommended as a part of patient safety culture.",

These patients have higher possibilities of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO) infection. It is commonly detected during admisssion period, and its culture periond is 3\u223c5 days. In order to early detect these special organism and strain early intervention including contact isolation, we started routine screening of MDRO in our hospital from Jan. 1st to Dec. 31th, 2016. Methods: We assessed all our inpatients on the admission day for the risk of multiple drug-resistant bacteria. For those who from long-term care facility and hospitalized history in six month, we did routine rectal swab with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) medium and urine culture. We also performed preventive contact isolation on the first day of admission. Laboratory staff received the sample and repored according to 2015 CLSI norms. Background: Both measles and rubella are vaccine-preventable diseases. According to the guideline of Taiwan CDC for healthcare workers (HCWs), we aimed to evaluate the boost efficacy of 1-dose or 2-doses of MMR vaccine among young HCWs. Methods: From Jan. 2016 to Dec. 2016, the elegible individuals included new junior staffs and interns working in the hospital for at least one month. For anti-measles virus-IgG, VIDAS \u00ae Measles IgG test kit (bioM\u00e9rieux) was used, and the results were read by mini VIDAS \u00ae immunoanalyzer (bioM\u00e9rieux) and were expressed as negative, equivocal, and positive. For anti-rubella virus-IgG, Elecsys Rubella IgG test kits (Roche) was used on Cobas \u00ae 6000 analyzer (Roche). The results were expressed as non-reactive and reactive. Second or third measurement of serum antibodies were performed at one month after MMR vaccination. At their discretion of the staffs, one or two doses of MMR vaccines at one month interval were freely provided only for the staffs with negative/equivocal or non-reactive results of serum IgG antibodies.",

Our infection control department investigated it and found that one nursing staff, one caretaker and one patient were diagnosed as scabies infection, we assumed that they were infected by a patient who was transfered from nursing home. The patient had thick black crust in his two fingers and two lower limbs when he was admitted to our hospital since 1 January, 2016. We consulted the dermatologist, he was diagnosed as subacute dermatitis and contact isolation was implemented thereafter. He was referred to other hospital and then scabies was diagnosed. Methods: The spread of scabies clusters were due to delayed diagnosis and contact isolation (No wearing a protective clothing when contact with the patient, not using of personal medical equipment). The infection control department implemented the following strategies: (1) Organizing the education and training of scabies. (2) Formulate the rules of those patients who were transferred from nursing home should implement contact isolation, and the skin should be checked such as: fingers, palms, wrist, armpit, hip, around the navel, genitourinary parts. If any abnormality are found we should consult the dermatologist. (3) Set up the computer information system to order the contact isolation according to the diagnostic code and medication of scabies. (4) Use personal sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. (5) Make sure cleaning and disinfection of the equipment and environment. Results: Long-term care institutions patients are at the high risk of scabies infection, and the symptoms are often atypical, and caused medical staff easy to ignore the isolation measures and resulted in outbreak, and also increases the risk of infection in medical staff. In order to reduce the spread of scabies, the implementation of longterm care institutions patients with contact isolation on his own initiative and skin assessment is very important, and the setting of information reminding system can also help. Following the implementation of the above measures, tracking the incidence of scabies in the medical ward of the third floor from February 2016 to April 2017, and we found no spread of scabies, showing that the strategy was effective.",

All intensive care unit admissions were screened on admission and weekly thereafter. Interventions included isolating/ cohorting VRE patients, monthly prevalence surveys of VRE patients, the introduction of an electronic alert system, programmes to improve hand and environmental hygiene, and the appointment of an antibiotic Physician. Results: In the sample of 264 patients investigated, 11.7% of patients had positive VRE while in the performance of periodic surveillance directed at patients at risk (193 cases), 8.08% showed positive result for the VRE. 11.0% out of 161 VRE colonized patients developed BSI by VRE. 43.9% had central venous catheter inserted as well. Most patients had one or more of the known risk factors associated with colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. 94.7% of the patients received antibiotics during the study, and 15.2% received vancomycin. Conclusions: Colonization by VRE was mostly endemic and the colonized patients were not often infected. However, when clustered cases of colonization occurred, they were then associated with an increased rate of infection. Routine surveillance for VRE together with other measures can control VRE infection and colonization, even where VRE is endemic, and where facilities are constrained. Evidence of colonization of patient's means it can be empirical precaution and thus provide patient safety by minimizing the risk of nosocomial infection.",

Of all infection control methods, hand hygiene remains one of the most fundamental and critical part, thus hand hygiene compliance rate was set as threshold and monitored for improvement. Data of HAIs and internal auditing of hand hygiene at Chiayi Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, a regional teaching hospital of southern Taiwan, between 2011 and 2016 was collected and analyzed. Pearson correlation analysis was used to investigate the correlation between hand hygiene compliance rate, and overall and ICUs' HAIs incidence per thousand inpatient-days. Linear regression method was adopted to reveal the trend of the HAIs' rate. Trend analysis is based on the slope of regression trend lines. Results: Slopes for overall inpatient and ICU inpatient HAIs are \u22120.018 (R 2 = 0.65) and \u22120.201(R 2 = 0.72), respectively. Results show over the period of time (from 2011 to 2016), ICUs HAIs has declined markedly. During 2016, the overall and ICU HAIs per thousand patients-day are 1.38\u2030 and 4.52\u2030, respectively. Using our linear regression model, the average of first 4 months of 2017, overall and ICU HAI rates will be approximately 1.37\u2030 and 4.45\u2030, showing large portion of HAI reduction will be contributed by ICUs. Preliminary data of first 4 months of 2017 showed, overall and ICU HAI rates are 1.43\u2030 and 3.43\u2030, respectively. Such result showed HAI rate has an overall slight increase (0.05\u2030) and a markedly decrease in ICU (1.02\u2030) in the first four month of 2017, which is compatible to our assumption based on prediction model. Pearson correlation showed hand hygiene compliance rate has significantly strong correlation with ICU HAI rate (r = \u22120.843, p = 0.035), but not with overall HAI rate (r = \u22120.532, p = 0.277). Background: Blood culture contamination (BCC) results in not only increased workload on lab staffs but overuse and abuse of antibiotics, which causes a raised cost, prolong hospital stay, and invalid treatment. Therefore, decreasing BCC rate is very important. During 2015-2016, ICU in a regional teaching hospital in midland of Taiwan showed average BCC rate was 14.9-18.1%, much higher than threshold value (3%). The infection control team had inspected the procedure of blood sample collection and found 3 improper operation procedures as the followings: (1) hand hygiene, to (4.17\u223c4.76%). Conclusion: Although the BCC improvement program did not reduce the BCC rate to be below 3%, yet the use of 2% CHG to execute skin disinfection did decrease the BCC rate, shorten the waiting time of skin disinfection, increase working efficiency of medical staffs, and elevate quality of healthcare.",

We hypothesized that the infection control response may have had a secondary benefit of reducing incidence of healthcare associated infections (HAIs). Methods: We implemented first stage of infection control measures since October 2015 including complete terminal disinfection and cohort isolation of patients with CRKP or CRPA or VRE. Second stage of interventions started since April 2016 and comprised applying chlorhexidine (CHG) bathing to patients in ICU as well as finding and disinfection or eradication of niduses from which MDRO were cultured. The items of niduses discovered were feeding cups and plastic baskets belonging to individual bed but not individual patient, working tables of nurses, and two communal bedpans. We analyzed data retrospectively from a prospective infection control database since May 2015 at the ICU of 41 beds and calculated the monthly trends of HAIs before and after two stages of infection control measures in ICU after adjusting the effects of hand hygiene and antibiotics usage. In order to assess the changes of HAIs in 3 periods, we used the generalized additive model (GAM). The fixed effects were period, time ( per 1 month), DID, the compliance and the accuracy of hand washing, and the random effect was period*time. The random effect showed the change of HAIs after interventions. Results: After implementation, the trend of UTI showed reversely downward although the trend of HAP was as same as before ( Figure) . There was a significant reduction trend in UTI after second stage of interventions (RR 0.48, 95%CI 0.23-0.99) (Table) . Results: There were 53 patients infected with CRE, whose specimens including sputum (n = 18), urine (n = 13), wound (n = 9), ascites (n = 2), line (n = 2), bile (n = 1), and blood (n = 8 The group had 19% non-compliance in hand microbial counts. 15% of the acceptable group had microbial load close to the upper limit (>10 6 ). Observation revealed they all did not have thorough scrubbing during HH but most of them achieved 90% or above reduction of bacterial load after using sanitizer. All participants used <40 seconds in hand washing (WHO recommends 40-60 seconds). Over 50% reported washing their hands only when observable dirt was found. Cohort at the most crowded location had the highest microbial count per individual but lowest incidence and counts of Staphylococcus aureus. MRSA isolates were found in 4 participants before HH but they were all removed after use of sanitizer. Coliform counts were compliant. Yeast and mould count was relatively low. 80% of them claimed that their employment agencies provided hygiene training. Discussion revealed that they all welcome further enhancement in hygiene knowledge and on the job training. Conclusion: Domestic helpers require enhanced supports on hygiene training. Special attention should be given on infection control. Carriers could have the risk of spreading MRSA/resistant species in the community. On-the-job training for Domestic helpers is desirable.",

Background: The hospital will begin in 2015 to execute \"invasive medical treatment care quality upgrade program\" from the Ministry of Health and Welfare Department of Disease Control Agency. The project is needed to complete the catheter placement checklist and daily care table, which is a big burden for the clinical staff. However, comparing of before and after the implementation of the project, arrangements for staff to fill out the cognitive questionnaire, it was found that the implementation of CAUTI Bundle for the patient is meaningful and recognized, but if the form of information can reduce the burden of paper work, can increase the implementation of combined care of health care workers to implement the wishes. Methods: In October 2016, the CAUTI Bundle form was compiled into the participating units. When nurses added pipelines to the familiar piping system, they set up the table and brought the basic information into the future. In addition, when the doctor opened the urinary catheter surgeon, that is, start the placement of the table to fill the reasons for the placement.

SCGE was able to subtype 12 C. nivariensis into four ITS SCGE length types (LTs). All isolates failed to be identified by the Vitek MALDI-TOF MS system (bioM\u00e9rieux), whilst the Bruker MS system (Bruker Daltoniks) correctly identified all C. nivariensis isolates but using a lowered (\u22651.700) cut-off score for species assignment; the C. bracarensis isolate was identified but with score <1.700. The Vitek 2 Compact system could not identify 11 C. nivariensis and one C. bracarensis isolate and misidentified the remaining C. nivarensis strain as \"C. glabrata\". All isolates had low MICs for azoles, echinocandins, amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine. Conclusion: Our results reinforce the need for molecular differentiation of species of C. nivarensis and C. bracarensis.

Patients with pathogen identified by isolation or PCR from respiratory tract specimens or blood, or those with seroconversion will be classified as having a definite etiology. Patients with pathogen identified by means of antigen detection will be classified as having a possible etiology. Background: Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen that can also asymptomatically colonize the nares of between 20% and 40% of the adult population. Methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA,) which may also display resistance to multiple other drugs, are a major cause of healthcare associated infections worldwide. There is increasing concern that strains of S. aureus in the clinical setting can also harbour genes (qacA/B and smr) for reduced susceptibility to commonly used antiseptics and disinfectants, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine. It is well recognised that elderly subjects residing in long-term care facilities (LTCF) can act as reservoirs of MRSA, but little is known of its prevalence in healthy elderly living in the community. We aimed to determine prevalence of MRSA and presence of biocide resistance genes in healthy elderly subjects attending community centres for the elderly. Methods: Elderly attendees at seven community centres for the elderly were screened for MRSA nasal colonization. Swabs were cultured on chromogenic agar for MRSA and isolates confirmed by MALDI-TOF. Susceptibility testing was performed following EUCAST guidelines. qacA/B and smr were determined by PCR.",

Tolerance to biocides may contribute to persistence of MRSA in the community as well as the healthcare setting. Continued monitoring of such strains is essential, as well as education on the proper use of biocides and antiseptics to prevent residue remaining in the environment which could act as a facilitator for induction of biocide tolerance.",

This nationwide populationbased cohort study was aimed to determine the short-term and long-term effect of HAART on incident TB in people living with HIV/ AIDS (PLWHA) in Taiwan Background: In the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, bacteremia is the one of an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. Few studies have described these patients. The study aimed to assess the etiologic pathogens, sites of infection, mortality rate and the factors associated with the mortality in HIV-infected patients who had bacteremia. Methods: Retrospective electronic database and chart review of the HIV-infected patients with bacteremia at Vajira Hospital between January 1, 2009 to November 30, 2014 was performed. Results: Of the 115 HIV-infected patients, 67 (57.4%) were male, of these 83 (59.7%) were not receiving antiretroviral drug and 65 (46.8%) had CD4 below 50 cells/mm 3 . Among 150 isolates of bacteremia, we found that the most common organism was Salmonella spp. (46, 30.67%) and Escherichia coli (E.coli) (35, 23.33%). Ceftriaxone resistance was high (91.3%) in bacteremia caused by Salmonella group C. The common sites of infection were primary bacteremia (38%) and urinary tract infection (15.1%). The mortality rate was 23% and the factor that affected the mortality were albumin level (P = 0.002), underlying disease (P < 0.005), cirrhosis (P < 0.005), chronic renal failure (P = 0.009), malignancy (P = 0.012), focal site of infection (P < 0.005), lower respiratory tract infection (P < 0.05), and intraabdominal infection (P < 0.05).

Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan Background: Dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is responsible for \u223c390 million infections annually, and leads to dengue fever or potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or shock syndrome (DSS). DHF/DSS patients often show severe symptoms such as vascular leakage and thrombocytopenia. During dengue infection, DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) can be secreted into blood and causes vascular leakage. However, whether NS1 is involved in the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that NS1 may play a critical role of DENV-induced thrombocytopenia. Methods: To verify this hypothesis, freshly isolated platelets from healthy donors were treated with DENV type 1 recombinant NS1 from drosophila and were evaluated for markers of activation, cytokine secretion and aggregation. Results: We found that NS1 could bind to toll-like receptor 4 of platelets. Furthermore, P-selectin expression and macrophage migration inhibitory factor secretion were increased in NS1stimulated platelets. Last, platelets aggregation with suboptimal dose of ADP was enhanced after NS1 stimulation. Conclusion: Taken together, our results demonstrate that NS1 could directly bind to platelet and induce platelet activation. These results suggest that NS1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia during dengue infection.",

The neurotropic nature of HEVA71 can cause severe infection and complications including encephalitis and even death. Due to the lack of effective antivirals to curb HEVA71 infections, this study adopted an approach of identifying potential therapeutic agents through reverse genetics and high throughput screen of a flavonoid compound library. Methods: A 500-compound flavonoid derivatives library was screened with the HEVA71 Bi-cistronic IRES construct to identify compounds with anti-HEVA71 IRES activity. Chosen hits were further verified with cell viability and viral plaque assays. Results: The high throughput screen with the flavonoid compounds has identified MARVAS09 as a potent inhibitor of HEV71. Downstream secondary assays reaffirmed that MARVAS09 can disrupt viral protein and viral RNA synthesis through reducing HEV71 IRES activity. Further studies deduced that MARVAS09 was a narrow-spectrum antiviral, which is only effective against human enteroviruses but not chikungunya virus or herpes simplex type 1 virus. The development of HEVA71 resistant mutants against MARVAS09 demonstrated the effectiveness of MARVAS09 against a critical target of HEVA71, namely the viral IRES. More importantly, we are able to show the strong in-vivo efficacy of MARVAS09 with the murine model challenged with HEVA71. Conclusion: In conclusion, MARVAS09 is a potent antiviral against HEVA71 and possibly other human enteroviruses which can be further developed as a potential clinical antiviral for HFMD.",

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are immunocompromised, but HHV-8 seroprevalence in COPD patients has not been documented. Methods: Blood samples collected from 64 COPD patients and from 64 age-and sex-matched healthy controls were used to determine lymphocyte and monocyte counts and HHV-8 antibody and DNA. Results: COPD patients had a lower lymphocyte count and a higher monocyte count than healthy controls (P = 0.0006 and 0.0003, respectively). The seroprevalence of HHV-8 antibodies was moderately higher in COPD patients than in controls (37.5% vs. 26.6%, P = 0.18). Three patients who were positive for HHV-8 antibodies were also positive for HHV-8 DNA. Lymphocyte counts were higher in COPD patients positive for HHV-8 antibodies than in negatives (P = 0.014) and in COPD patients positive for HHV-8 DNA than in negatives (P = 0.048). Lymphocyte count increased (from 1,688 to 2,856 and 3,184 cells/\u03bcL) with increasing HHV-8 viral load (from 133 to 1,450 and 2,090 copies/mL). Conclusion: COPD patients have a modely higher HHV-8 seroprevalence than healthy controls. Lymphocyte count is significantly higher in COPD patients positive for HHV-8 antibodies or DNA than in negatives. Lymphocyte count increases with increase in HHV-8 viral load in patients positive for HHV-8 DNA. Methods: Multiple and sequential specimens of serum, nasopharynx swab and sputum/tracheal aspirate were collected. The virus (A/Taiwan/1/2017) was isolated from the respiratory specimen. The important and different molecular signatures of the A/Taiwan/1/ 2017, compared with previous H7N9 viruses were investigated. Results: The important and different molecular signatures of the A/Taiwan/1/2017 virus included an insertion of three basic amino acid residues (RKR) at the cleavage site connecting the HA1 (hemagglutinin) and HA2 peptide regions. For antiviral resistance, R292K substitution in the NA (neuraminidase) protein was found in the A/Taiwan/1/2017 virus, suggesting that this virus had developed resistance to oseltamivir. The NS1 of A/Taiwan/1/2017 is 237 amino acids in length and the previous isolates were 217 amino acids. The extended C-terminal region of 20 amino acids contains PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1) binding domain, which also contributes to pathogenicity. Conclusion: The signatures of high avian pathogenicity and oseltamivir resistance is of a concern and may have implication on clinical management and antiviral therapy. Current guideline that specifies neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) as drug of choice to treat patients infected with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus, should be revised based on geographic distribution of resistance, especially in Asia-Pacific region.",

            "text": "Trends in the molecular epidemiology of HCV: an individualpatient-and sequence-level analysis Siao-Ru Lin, Ming-Huei Gu. Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Taiwan Background: Regional and genotype-specific mutational patterns of HCV are essential for informing direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) and designing diagnostic assays for use in regions where standard genotypic resistance testing is not affordable. We try to understand the molecular epidemiology of drugresistance associate variants (RAVs) in treatment-na\u00efve HCVinfected patients. Methods: First, we set up a workflow for specimen collection, viral nucleic acid extraction, performing PCR assays, and directedsequence analysis. Then, we performed 2-step PCR assays on several specimens to find HCV genotype 1b-infected patients. To investigate the prevalence of RAVs to DAAs in treatment-naive HCV genotype 1b-infected patients, we amplify HCV viral regions of NS5A, and 5\u2032 untranslated-region. Using Bioedit \u00ae and Genotype tool on NCBI website analyzed the sequencing data. Results: We collected 34 reference genome of HCV from NCBI genebank as templates for HCV-specific primer set. The amplified target in silico was submitted in Genotyping tool. It showed 100% agreement. From November 2016 to May 2017, a total of 159 patients were enrolled in HCV genotype analysis. The genotype or subtype 1a, 1b, 2, 2a, 2b, 3, 3a, 6, 6a and 6w were identified in 6.9%, 56.0%, 5.0%, 20.8%, 4.4%, 0.6%, 0.6%, 3.1%, 1.3% and 1.3% of the successfully amplified cases, respectively. At same period, we performed HCV NS5A mutation analysis on 54 patients, mutation of codon 31, 93, and both of them were detected in 3.7%, 18.5% and 1.9% of cases, respectively. Conclusion: This study is still in progress, the conclution remaining unclear. However, naturally occurring RAVs to DAAs pre-exist in treatment-naive HCV genotype 1b-infected patients. Clinicians should consider RAVs before start DAA-based antiviral therapy. He suffered from upper airway infections (cough, running nose and sorethroat) 4-5 days prior to admission. He also fell onto the ground but brain CT showed no obvious intra-cranial hemorrhage. He suffered from rapid respiration and chest CT revealed subpleural consolidations at LUL and bilateral lower lobes, more at RLL, which favoured bilateral pneumonia. He had to be admitted to our intensive care unit after ET tube intubation and mechanical ventilation use. Influenza rapid test showed influenza A. Oral Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) was initiated and 600mg Peramivir (Rapiacta) was added in use as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed. FiO2 100% had to be used. However, his ARDS improved soon after Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and intra-venous Peramivir (Rapiacta) were continued in use. RT-PCR of Taiwan CDC confirmed influenza A (H3) infection. (Oseltamivir and Peramivir (Rapiacta) had been used for 5 days and 7 days respectively.) His ET tube could be removed 1 week later. He became stable and could be discharged on day 14. Discussion: (1) This patient suffered from severe respiratory complications induced by influenza but could get well soon after proper prompt use (within 24 hours) of the neuraminidase inhibitor. (2) There was not any guideline or studies about concurrent use of neuraminidase inhibitors Oseltamivir and Peramivir together. In our patient, his fever subsided after Peramivir use and no need for ECMO use. It seemed that Oseltamivir and Peramivir could be used together and had no antagonism to each other. After Peramivir binds to NA enzyme, they are not easily dissociated, and Peramivir can inhibit the NA activity for longer period.",

Accumulating evidence suggests that CMV reactivates in critically ill patients such as those with sepsis. Controversy exists with respect to the association between CMV reactivation and outcome of sepsis, and how the virus reactivates during the course of sepsis were not fully investigated. In this study, we systemically investigated the reactivation pattern of CMV during the course of sepsis and correlated the results to the outcome of sepsis. Methods: For sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care unit, blood samples were collected on day 1, 4, 8, 14 , and 28 during the hospital stay. CMV was detected by PCR and the viral loads were measured by quantitative PCR. Serum cytokine and CMV IgG were determined by ELISA. Patients' clinical characteristics and survival within 28 days were recorded and correlated to the results of CMV detection. Results: All the 262 included patients were seropositive for CMV IgG. During the 28-day in-hospital follow-up course, CMV was detected by PCR at least once in 25.2% (66/262) of the patients. The positive rate of CMV PCR increased from the initial 7.7% on day 1 to 36.7% on day 28. The median viral load was lower during the early (day 1\u22128) than the late (day 14\u221228) follow-up phase (relative median viral load 1.42 vs 4.29, p = 0.020). Detection of CMV on day 1 was associated with a lower 28-day survival rate compared with those whose blood was negative for CMV on day 1 ( p = 0.0057). A higher serum interleukin (IL)-2 level, which denoted monocyte activation, was observed in patients with positive CMV PCR, especially on day 1. Conclusion: The frequency of CMV reactivation increased during the course of sepsis. Early reactivation of CMV during the initial phase of sepsis was associated with a poorer outcome. Interaction between CMV and host monocytes may play a role in the pathophysiology of sepsis.",

            "text": "Background: Viruses infect all Three Domains of life, however the knowledge of archaeal viruses is limited. Lately, the diverse virus morphology and the independent virus development outside the extreme thermophilic/acidophilic archaeal host attracted the attention on archaea viral investigations. Currently, over 100 archaeal viruses have been discovered, most related to thermophilic Crenarchaea and extreme halophilic Euryarchaea. However, almost none methanoarchaeal virus was reported for the past two decades. From the core sediment on the top of gas hydrate habitat in the deformation front site offshore south-western Taiwan, Methanoculleus taiwanensis CYW4 T was enriched, isolated and characterized. Cell lysis was observed at stationary phase and a lytic virus (designed as Mta) which caused the lysis of strain CYW4 T was observed under TEM. Methods: The stationary phase grown M. taiwanensis CYW4 T culture was harvested. And virus was purified by PEG precipitation and gel filtration through a Sephacryl S-500HR column. The purified viral DNA was obtained after phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Whole genome sequencing of virus Mta was performed using Illumina MiSeq. Functions of predicted ORFs and putative conserved domain were analyzed by BLASTP and BLASTX. The distant homologs searches were performed by HHpred (S\u00f6ding et al., 2005) . Background: Chronic active EBV disease (CAEBV) is a rare and fatal complication of EBV infection. Unlike the cases in western countries, where EBV infected B cells, the majority cases in Asia and South American are found in T cell or natural killer cell. CAEBV is characterized by (1) markedly elevated EBV antibody or EBV DNA in blood (2) histologic evidence of organ infiltrated with virusinfected cells (3) detection of EBV protein or nucleic acid in tissue. We report a fatal case of EBV positive clonal T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder presenting as pulmonary cryptococcosis. Methods: This 69 year-old farmer, was admitted in mid July, 2014, because of intermittent fever up to 39^C, cough with whitish sputum for two weeks. Cryptococcal pneumonia was confirmed by sono-guided lung biopsy in March, 2014, with blood cryptococcal antigen at titer of 1:64. Ineffective initial fluconazole treatment was replaced with combining liposomal amphotericin B and 5flurocytosine. Later, however, even adding pip/tazo treatment for possible nosocomial infection, the patient was still febrile. Results: On admission day 11, diffuse skin rash and multiple lymph nodes in level I\u223cIV were found. Chest and abdomen CT revealed multiple lymphadenopathy in neck, mediastinum and retroperitoneum. Skin rash biopsy showed dermis infiltrated by T cells. Neck lymph node showed necrotizing lymphadenitis with eosinophilic necrotic debris and lymphoid hyperplasia. Immunohistochemistry by staining CD3 was performed on fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, compared with in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER). Both skin biopsy and lymph node were positive for EBER and CD3, confirming EBV infected T cells ( Figure A) . Also, EBV viral load was markedly elevated of 72,888 copies/mL. Other study met the characteristics of CAEBV, including positive EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-NA-IgG and negative EBV-VCA-IgM, EBV-EA-IgG. CD4 was 104/uL, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was initiated for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis Jiroveci pneumonia, although HIV negative. Anti-IFN-gamma antibodies were negative. The patient became afebrile with tigecycline, and was discharged in late August, 2014. He completed 1 year oral itraconzole treatment, but died of sepsis at other hospital in June, 2017. Conclusion: This case presented with pulmonary cryptococcosis was diagnosed with fatal T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder with CAEBV which is characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, and rashes. EBV is detected in T cells by immunohistochemistry. Studies for T-cell clonality confirm the diagnosis.",

Conclusion: Although topical antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis accounts for only a small percentage of intra-operative prescribing, more than three-quarters of these prescriptions were deemed inappropriate. Due to reported poor documentation of the use of topical antimicrobials in surgical procedures, this would represent an underestimate of the true proportion of their use.

Background: Drug resistance issues are worrisome and concerned all over the world. The appropriate use of antibiotics has been mentioned all the times. However, facing up to the constantly detection of the various multi drug resistance microorganisms, brings out that the rigor examinations and the control execution effectiveness of the antibiotic needs to be reviewed and improved all the time. Coordination from the antibiotics stewardship and the database system can make the control more effectively. Our hosptial since the beginning of the implementation of antibiotics stewardship has been four years. Both of the detection of drugresistant strains and the use of antibiotics have been declined. Methods: Our hospital has utilizing the database systems to assist executing in the antibiotic medication control, the infectious disease specialist would follow the \"laboratory reports\" and \"current medical orders\" at the analysis systems to exam then provide the professional commends especially before the report of the blood culture, it could only approved three days of antibiotics for the upgrade or downgrade. The quick identification of the equipments and methods can shorten the reporting time, so that clinicians can choose the appropriate anti-auxiliaries. Drugresistant bacteria were checked out immediately then proceed to isolate immediately. When the patient moves out then implement the disinfection of environmental cleaning and proceed the joint auditing. Results: Overview of the antibiotics stewardship in a 4-year study period (2013-2016) The DID Usage density of antibiotics (per 1,000 bed-day-occupancy) have been declined 30%, the Penicillins have been declined 35%, and Carbapenems declined 40%, Glycopeptide and Fluoroquinolone use to show stability. Carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus reported a 50% drop in new cases. Conclusion: The original use of antibiotics is for the treatment of bacterial infection, but must pay attention to the use of the period and follow the rules and the recommendations.

She was complained of left lower quadrant pain, sleepy and septic shock was also noted. The abdomen computed tomography revealed right perirenal abscess, that pigtail drainage catheter was inserted. The blood culture and pig tail drainage abscess culture showed KP, emperical antibiotic of flomoxef use. However, she started to have redness of left eye within 24 hr then she had sudden pain, eyelid swelling and conjunctival chemosis was found and endogenous KP endophthalmitis was suspected. A orbital computed tomography revealed left orbital intraconal/extraconal space and left periorbital abscess and postseptal cellulitis, consistent with left endophthalmitis. Results: Thus, the ophthalmology was given intravitreal injection of antibiotic of ceftazidime 2 mg/0.1 cc and eye drops use. Visual acuity in the left eye deteriorated to no light perception over a 48-hour period, the intraocular pressure was 47-49 mmHg. We adjusted antibiotic to meropenem and prescuded mannitol to reduced intraocular pressure. The left eye received intravitreal injection one dose, mannitol intravenous injection three dose and meropenem for two weeks therapy. Although, the left eye no bacteria could be cultured and blindness, but stable hemodynamic status and transferred to ordinary ward. Conclusion: Acute endophthalmitis is a medical emergency. Endophthalmitis is a clinical diagnosis that is confirmed by positive aqueous or vitreous culture. However, a negative culture does not exclude the diagnosis. The primary part of the specimen culture and blood culture has a high diagnostic value, but because the eye is not easy to obtain a large number of specimens. Eye culture of the positive rate is low, even less than 30%, so usually as long as the clinical symptoms can be diagnosed. Decrease in ambulatory consumption of cephalexin and cotrimoxasole in the period of five years (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) was observed, followed by significant decline in antimicrobial resistance of E. coli to these two drugs (to 10.2% and 23.3% in 2010, and to 6.7% and 24.5% in 2015, respectively), especially in females aged <65 years ( p < 0,01). The highest resistance rates for any isolate-antimicrobial combination ( particularly to fluoroquinolones) were detected in older males. The total proportion of ESBL producing E. coli strains rose from 1.6% in 2005 to 4.0% in 2010, and to 5% in 2015, with especially high resistance rate in older age groups ( p < 0.001). Conclusion: Decrease in consumption of certain antibiotics in the community leads to improvement in bacterial susceptibility. Due to the updates in Croatian guidelines on empirical treatment of CA-UTIs, changes in ambulatory use of antibiotics occurred. Withdrawal of amoxicillin, cephalexin and co-trimoxasole from the list of first line agents for empirical treatment of uncomplicated cystitis, elicited significant improvement in susceptibility of uropathogenic E. coli to these antibiotics. Since no obvious rise in fluoroquinolones use occurred, the increasing trend in resistance which might be caused by the spread of highly epidemic fluoroquinolone-resistant uropathogenic E. coli clonal groups, particularly in older men, requires further investigation.",

Aichi Prefectural Infection Control Network, which is led by the regional administration in Japan, has performed a surveillance of antimicrobial consumption and resistance after 2010. Herewith, we present the results of the regional multicenter evaluation of the antimicrobial consumption and resistance within seven years. Conclusion: We had clarified the regional transition of antimicrobial consumption in seven years. Notably, although analysis of carbapenems consumption showed an increase based on the values measured by AUD and DOT after 2013, no increase was noted in the carbapenems resistance for P. aeruginosa. The AUD/DOT ratio of carbapenems might contribute decreased carbapenems resistance in P. aeruginosa. Previous studies also showed that high plasma concentration of linezolid may induce thrombocytopenia. Only few studies demonstrated the relationship between plasma concentration and clinical outcomes, and to our knowledge, no research was conducted in the Han Chinese population.

Adult patients with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of linezolid were included. Linezolid peak and trough concentrations were measured by HPLC and then used to calculate the 24 hour areaunder-the-curve (AUC). All patients' data were collected via electronic medical charts. The safety and clinical outcomes were assessed throughout the treatment course until 7 days after the completeness of linezolid and 30-day mortality was also recorded. All AEs were evaluated by Naranjo score, and the definite/probable AEs were defined as linezolid-related adverse events in the analysis. Results: Among 49 patients enrolled in the study, mean age were 61.2 years old and 49% were male. There were 66 linezolid TDMs collected, and most (80.4%) were performed within 14 days. The median trough, peak and AUC of standard dose (600 mg twice daily) and reduced dose (600 mg daily) were 9.19 mg/L, 24.33 mg/L, 360.98 mg/L-hr and 3.48 mg/L, 21.59 mg/L, 199.97 mg/L-hr, respectively. Plasma concentrations were 1.5-to 2 folds higher than which in the prescribing information but similar to the results in Japanese studies. Thrombocytopenia was the most common adverse events (62%) and peripheral neuropathy appeared infrequent (6%). Median trough concentration was significantly higher in patients with thrombocytopenia (total AEs: 13.06 vs. 6.97 mg/L, p = 0.0292; related AEs: 17.55 vs. 6.97 mg/L, p = 0.0007). Median trough level was also significantly higher in related leukopenia AE (22.54 vs. 9.62 mg/L, p = 0.0291). No association was identified between plasma concentration and anemia, lactic acidosis, peripheral neuropathy or clinical outcomes including mortality. Conclusion: Linezolid plasma concentrations of standard dose were 1.5-to 2 folds higher than which in the prescribing information, but similar to the results in Japanese studies. Higher trough concentration was associated with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia; however, no significant difference was observed between linezolid concentration and other AEs or clinical outcome.

Background: A part of Escherichia coli most frequently isolated as a causative agent on urinary tract infection is a strain called UPEC (Uropathogenic Escherichia coli). UPEC is involved in chronicity and refractory urinary tract infections due to adhesion and invasion to the urothelial cell surface by type I pili and formation of Biofilm. It is elucidated in our previous study that proanthocyanidin A2(PAC), a cranberry-specific component, influences the adhesion and invasiveness of UPEC to urothelial cells. In addition, there are reports that PACs affect the quorum-sensing mechanism contributing to the formation of Biofilm and decrease pathogenic factors. Methods: As strains to be used, 3 strains (BK1, BK2, BK3) of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), standard strain E. coli K12, Pseudomonas aeruginosa standard strain PAO1 and blood derived Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1 strain (568). First, the Microtiter Plate Assay was performed to evaluate biofilm formation and compared with non-addition of PAC and addition of PAC. Second, expression of csgA, csgD, crl, fimH which are biofilm related genes of Escherichia coli was examined by Polymerase Chain Reaction assay. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of PAC on the expression of biofilm associated genes was also investigated. Results: Biofilm formation was more decreased in case of addition of PAC than in case of non-addition of PAC. K12, BK1, BK2 and BK3 all expressed the genes of csgA, csgD, crl, fimH. However, even if PAC is added, it did not affect to expression of biofilm genes of E. coli. Conclusion: Our study showed that PAC suppresses biofilm formation and proved that its cause is not inhibiting the expression of biofilm associated gene. In addition, it was inferred that the cause of inhibition of biofilm formation by PAC is not by the gene mutation but the PAC itself influences intermolecular relationship such as quorum-sensing mechanism. Therefore, we need to further investigate how PAC affects quorum-sensing intermolecular.",

It has excellent bactericidal ability for many nosocomial infections, including Acinetobacter species, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Due to the limitations of antibiotics selection for multidrug resistance gram-negative bacteria (MDR-G(-)) infected pneumonia, the risk of infection mortality is very high. In this case, colsitn is the most common used antibiotic for MDR-G(-) infections. Except conventional intravenous(iv) injection of colistin, inhaled colistin increasing the concentration in lung tissue is a new administration route as an off-label use. However, the uncertainty effectiveness and safety need more investigation. Therefore, the effectiveness of inhalation colistin was compare with injection colistin in this study. Methods: Patients from January to December in 2016 using iv injection and inhaled colistin for more than 72 hours were enrolled into this study. The assessment criteria included bacterial culture results, down-grade or withdrawal colistin after treatment, the average length of hospital stay, and mortality rate. Results: The total number of patients treated with colistin iv vs. inhalation were 106 vs. 56 respectively. The mean age was 74.01 \u00b1 14.51 years old vs. 75.82 \u00b1 13.19 years old. The days of drug use were 10.09 \u00b1 4.56 days vs. 11.06 \u00b1 6.40 days, respectively. Down-grade or withdrawal colistin after treatment was 55 cases (51.89%) vs. 24 cases (42.86%), respectively. The average hospital stay was 28.50 \u00b1 17.17 days vs. 46.00 \u00b1 25.41 days after treatment, the mortality rates were 50.94% vs. 53.57%. Conclusion: In the study, iv injection of colistin in patients with complex infection was still better than inhalation. At present, iv injection of colstin treating hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator acquired pneumonia (VAP) was still recommended as the primary route. Since the patients used colistin with very complicated infections, the effectiveness and safety may need the largescale clinical studies to approve in the future.",

However, whether ATP directly exhibits antimicrobial effects against intracellular mycobacteria is still unknown. Since we recognized direct antibacterial activity in ATP against bacteria including mycobacteria, we studied the mechanism of its antimicrobial effects. Additionally, we examined the detailed profile of the anti-Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) activity of some antimicrobial agents in combination with ATP. Methods: We used mycobacteria including MAC, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and common bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus. To confirm the mediation of antibacterial activity of ATP by its ironchelating effect, we established an enterobactin-deficient mutant strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae by deleting the entB gene. Bacterial siderophore production was measured by CAS (Chrome Azurol S) assay. We used clarithromycin, ethambutol, rifampin and rifabutin to evaluate the combined effects of ATP with anti-MAC drugs against MAC organisms. Results: The species and strain dependency of common bacteria were examined for their ATP susceptibility. ATP markedly inhibited the growth of M. intracellulare. Meanwhile, M. avium was moderately susceptible or resistant to ATP. S. aureus was moderately to highly susceptible. ATP's anti-MAC activity was significantly reduced by MgCl 2 and FeCl 3 . ATP-resistant Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae produced significant levels of siderophores when cultivated in the presence of ATP. ATP exhibited moderate levels of antimicrobial effects on the mutant K. pneumoniae strain. Moreover, it was found that the anti-MAC activity of the selected drugs was markedly potentiated in a strain-dependent manner. In this case, the onset of the regrowth of antimicrobial agent-treated mycobacteria during cultivation was significantly delayed in the presence of ATP. Conclusion: In this study, ATP's antibacterial activity was found to be attributable to its iron-chelating ability. We also found that ATP inhibited the growth of various bacteria, including mycobacteria, without damaging the bacterial surface structures. Thus, ATP is promising as an adjunctive agent for chemotherapy against mycobacterial infections using anti-MAC drugs. We are currently examining the change in anti-MAC activity on increasing the intramacrophage ATP concentration.",

Background: The emergence of antibiotic resistance has imposed a serious challenge to public health worldwide. In the United States, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections claim nearly 11,300 lives each year. As conventional antibiotics are not sufficient to treat MRSA infections, a new antibiotic with novel action mechanism is highly needed. Previously, our group showed a small-molecule compound, SC5005, exhibiting synergistic antibacterial activity with a natural product against MRSA. Here, we aim to uncover the synergistic antibacterial mechanism of this combination. Methods: The antibacterial activity of SC5005 combined with HRCA7 against MRSA was assessed by MIC assay, MBC assay and Time-Kill assay. The cell toxicity of this combination was examined in different epithelial cell lines by using MTT cell viability assay. Furthermore, in vivo efficacy of SC5005 in combination with HRCA7 is evaluated in a mouse model of MRSA skin infection. Results: The screening of nature products identified HRCA7, which is capable of potentiating SC5005's antibacterial activity for more than 8,000 times. This combination also displayed a fast-killing activity against MRSA as demonstrated by an over 97% eradication of bacteria in broth within 5 minutes. In contrast, no effect of HRCA7 on SC5005's cytotoxicity toward human epithelial cells was observed. Subsequent experimental result indicated that short exposure of MRSA to SC5005 increased bacterial susceptibility to HRCA7. While the combinatory effect of SC5005 and HRCA7 can be reduced by antioxidants with long acyl-chain, including astaxanthin and alpha-tocopherol, in a dose-dependent manner, the addition of phenolic antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), by contrast, stablized HRCA7 and increased the antibacterial activity of this combination. Currently, studies to evaluate the efficacy of SC5005 combined with HRCA7 on MRSA skin infection are underway. Conclusion: The findings provide strong evidences that HRCA7's prooxidant activity plays an important role in the synergistic bactericidal effect with SC5005. This combination could be further developed as a topical medication for MRSA skin infections.",

Ceftolozane-tazobactam (TOL/TAZ), an antipseudomonal cephalosporin with a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (in combination with metronidazole) and complicated urinary tract infections by FDA in the United States and by European Medicines Agency. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility of TOL/TAZ and ten comparators (cefepime, cefoperazone-sulbactam, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam (PIP/TAZ) and tigecycline) was evaluated against isolates collected from medical centers in Taiwan. All testing of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) followed 2016 CLSI guidelines at a central laboratory (IHMA, Inc.). Results were interpreted using CLSI guidelines for all drugs except colistin (EUCAST) and tigecycline (FDA). Quality control strains were used in each day of testing. Background: Antibiotic therapy is the recommended choice for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections currently. Multidrug therapy is a standard practice, but few treatment options exist. Solution of intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance is a major difficulty of treatment. Several previous studies suggest that single extracts or formulations of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) alone or in combination with antibiotics may treat common bacterial infections. Therefore, synergistic combination therapy with antibiotics plus TCM could be an effective solution. This study is to provide an evidence for combination of TCM and antibiotics which may yield synergy in treatment of NTM infections. Methods: Two standard mycobacterial strains, Mycobacterium abscessus (College of American Pathologists, CAP) (RGM) and Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium (serotype 2) ATCC25291 (SGM), were chosen in this study. Three Scientific TCM formulations in extract subtly granule including Scute & Cimicifuga Combination (SCC), Dandelion & Wild Chrysanthemum Combination (DWCC) and Gleditsia Combination (GC) were applied to our experiment. Three steps of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements for a preset concentration of both mycobacteria were performed: monotherapy of CLSI recommended antibiotics, monotherapy of TCM formulations with serial dilution concentrations and combination with antibiotic plus SCC. All of the above steps were repeatedly performed to estimate the average of MICs. Results: Bacteriostatic effects of 3 TCM formulations were observed on both M. abscessus and M. avium. The inhibitory concentrations for SCC, DWCC and GC were above 60, 100 and 70 mg/mL, and above 60, 80 and 100 mg/mL, respectively. Significant reductions of MIC for M. abscessus and M. avium were also measured when SCC was added with a concentration of more than 25 mg/ml onto the commercial antibiotic wells. The MICs of M. abscessus for clarithromycin, tigecycline, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, and cefoxitin, M. avium for clarithromycin and ethambutol were significantly decreased when they were combined with 12.5 mg/mL of SCC. Conclusion: TCM formulation alone yielded a similar bacteriostatic effect as antibiotics on NTM was observed. Combination treatment with the TCM formulation plus antibiotics could have a synergistic antibacterial effect on NTM. The machanism of TCM formulation on the antibiotics resistance in NTM will be explored.",

It is major problem that multi drug resistant E. coli have been emergence and increasing. We investigated the susceptibility to various antibiotics against E. coli isolated in Western part of Japan. Methods: A total of 8,079 non-duplicate E. coli isolated from urinein the period from 2008 to 2016 in Japan were used in this study. We divided the isolates to isolation period every 3 years, duration A is 2008 to 2010, duration B is 2011 to 2013, and duration C is 2014 to 2016. The MICs of various antimicrobials against the isolates were determined by the two-fold serial agar dilution method as described by the CLSI. The resistant isolates to antimicrobials were basically interpreted according to CLSI breakpoint. Results: E. coli isolates from urinary tract, respiratory tract, wound, and blood stream accounted for 72.6% (58.7/81.9 inpatients/outpatients), 12.4% (25.1/4.1), 4.0% (6.0/2.6), and 3.0% (4.6/2.0), respectively. Table shows the ratio of ESBL producers and quinolone-resistants. ESBL producers have been increasing in both inpatients and outpatients. The ratio of quinolone-resistants from inpatients have no change between 2008 and 2016, however, the ratio of them from outpatients have been increasing, oviously. Background: Increased with resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to ceftriaxone (CTRX) is a global problem. We conducted a molecular epidemiological analysis of N. gonorrhoeae isolated in Japan for the purpose of examining CTRX resistance mechanism. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility to cefixime (CFIX) and CTRX was measured using N. gonorrhoeae isolated in Japan in 2014. Thirty two isolates were analyzed by amino acid sequence of penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2). Furthermore, the molecular epidemiological similarity was analyzed by Neisseria gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST).",

Patterns X and XXXIV were mosaic-like mutations in amino acid sequence.

But the mutation of PBP2 did not confer a clear influence on the decreased susceptibiliies to CTRX. This study suggested that the resistance mechanism of CTRX is not only due to the mutation of PBP2 but also by a complicated mechanism.",

The blaOXA-24/40-like gene products were all sequencing as the blaOXA-72 gene and was conformed at the plasmid. The plasmid was sequenced as pAB-NCGN253 with one copy of the blaOXA-72 gene. In previous studies, the plasmid, pAB-NCGN253, was transmitted in Acinetobacter baumannii rather than in Acinetobacter nosocomialis. The plasmid was extracted from the clinical Acinetobacter nosocomialis and transformed into Acinetobacter baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of imipenem, meropenem, doripenem and ertapenem were increased from 0.25 mg/L, 0.38 mg/L, 0.125 mg/L and 6 mg/L to \u226716 mg/L, \u226732 mg/L, \u22678 mg/L and \u226732 mg/L, respectively. Conclusion: In conclusion, it was found that the plasmid pAB-NCGN253 carrying blaOXA-72 was dominant in the imipenem non-susceptible Acinetobacter nosocomialis isolates. The plasmid contributes to carbapenem resistance and may spread between Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter nosocomialis. Background: Carbapenem resistance is a serious global concern and efforts to find novel resistance mechanisms is on-going. The well-known mechanisms include loss of both the porins (OmpK35 or OmpK36), derepression of AmpC-\u03b2-lactamase, ESBL production along with loss of either one of the porins. In this study, we isolated two Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from a single patient, before (K1) and after (K2) meropenem treatment. The two strains showed identical PFGE pattern, but differed only in their carbapenem susceptibility.",

Background: Citrobacter freundii in recent years have demonstrated resistance not only to traditional agents such as ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin, but also to newer \u03b2-lactam agents such as third-generation cephalosporins, and monobactams; and some of them even produce carbapenemases. This study was performed to characterize a C. freundii isolates JA3 collected in Taiwanese hospital, carrying a novel AmpC-type \u03b2-lactamaseencoding gene. Methods: Using antibiotic susceptibility testing, plasmid analysis, transconjugation, clonimg and sequences analysis AmpC-type \u03b2lactamase-encoding gene. \u03b2-Lactamase gene-containing recombinant plasmids transformed into Escherichia coli were selected using ampicillin. Results: The resistance phenotype of JA3, was found to produce a \u03b2-lactamase that conferred resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and cephamycins. Resistance arising from production of a betalactamase could be transferred by conjugation with an IncW plasmid pJA3 into E. coli J53. The substrate and inhibition profiles of this enzyme resembled those of the AmpC beta-lactamase. The resistance gene of pJA3 proved to contain an open reading frame showing 96% amino acid identity with the plasmid-mediated enzyme CEF-1 of C. freundii KU6400. DNA sequence analysis also identified a gene upstream of ampC whose sequence was 91.0% identical to the ampR gene from C. freundii KU6400. In addition, a fumarate operon (frdABCD) and an outer membrane lipoprotein (blc) surrounding the ampR-ampC genes in C. freundii were identified, and insertion sequence (IS26) elements were observed on one sides of the sequences identified. Conclusion: These results clearly show that a new plasmidencoded AmpC gene with an ampR gene from C. freundii.

            "text": "Background: Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are responsible for 70-90% of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Additionally, 20-40% of women who have been treated for UTIs experience recurrence at least once within 6 months of the initial infection. Despite proper antibacterial treatment, recurrent UTIs are secondary infections caused by the same strain of E. coli that caused the primary infection. The first-line agents for the treatment of UTIs are fluoroquinolones (FQs); however, in recent years, FQresistant E. coli have been increasingly reported worldwide. Proanthocyanidins (PACs), which are abundant in cranberries, have been used for the prevention of UTIs for over a century; however, the mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. In this study, A-type PAC was used to prevent recurrent UPEC infection via a different mechanism from that of conventional antibacterial therapy. Methods: The E. coli strain K-12 and the UPEC strains BK1, BK2, and BK3 were used in this study. The checkerboard method was used to evaluate the effect of the combination of an antibacterial and PAC on E. coli. Swarming and twitching motility was assessed using a plate-based assay. PAC was added at a concentration of 500 \u03bcM and was tested for its ability to inhibit the adhesion of E. coli to human bladder epithelial cells (HTB-9). Cell invasion inhibition was also tested in a similar manner. Results: The combination of PAC and CAZ showed a synergistic effect on BK1. PAC treatment significantly reduced the mean spreading range for swarming and twitching motility in K-12 and UPEC strains. The results for inhibition of the attachment of the UPEC strain to HTB-9 cells showed a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.05) with PAC (500 \u03bcM). Conversely, PAC did not inhibit the adherence of K-12 strain to HTB-9 cells. Mean values for HTB-9 cell invasion in PAC-treated UPEC strains were significantly smaller than those in untreated UPEC. Furthermore, K-12 did not show any invasion of HTB-9 cells. Conclusion: The combination of PAC and CAZ has an inhibitory effect on BK1. Because flagella-mediated motility has been suggested to be essential for UPEC to disseminate into the upper urinary tract, we propose that inhibition of flagellamediated motility may be a key mechanism through which PAC prevents UTIs. The in vitro anti-adhesive and anti-invasive activity of cranberry-derived PAC against UPEC suggests that its presence in urine can reduce bacterial colonization and UTI advancement.",

Due to the extensive use of antibiotics in clinical practice, the isolates of multidrug-resistant Aeromonas strains were increased. The pumps of the resistancenodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily are ubiquitous in Gram-negative bacteria and have the broadest substrate ranges. Increased expression of chromosomal genes for RND-type efflux systems plays a major role in the multidrug resistant of some Gramnegative bacteria. However, the contributions of RND efflux genes in development of multidrug resistant Aeromonas strains have not been evaluated in clinical settings. Methods: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was used for determination of the patterns of resistance to antibiotics in the presence or absence of efflux inhibitors. Multidrug resistance (\u22653 antimicrobial drug classes) in Aeromonas strains were selected for further analysis.

Background: The emergence of multiple-drug resistant bacteria, including Salmonella, has been a serious threat to public health worldwide. On top of that, Salmonella is capable of avoiding antibiotic attack after invading into host cells, leading to a problem in treatment. Thus, a novel therapeutic intervention to eradicate intracellular bacteria as well as to reduce the incidence of resistance is highly needed. Previously, we identified a small-molecule anticancer agent, AR-12, showing potent activity against Salmonella Typhimurium in macrophages and in a salmonellosis mice model. To dissociate its antibacterial activity from antiproliferative activity, a focused library of AR-12 was synthesized and screened for antibacterial activity against intracellular S. Typhimurium in macrophages and cytotoxicity toward the host cells. Methods: The antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of AR-12 derivatives were first assessed by using an image-based highcontent system. Compounds showing good selectivity of antibacterial activity over cytotoxicity were further analysed with intracellular infection assay and MTT cell viability assay. The effect of compounds on bacterial growth in broth was evaluated by using MIC assay. Results: Among the 125 compounds tested, Cpd42 and Cpd9 exhibited a better antibacterial activity than that of AR-12. Cpd22 and Cpd24 showed an antibacterial activity equal to that of AR-12, but have a much lower cytotoxicity toward host cells. The result of MIC assay indicated that these compounds have no inhibitory activity on bacteria in growth medium, suggesting that the suppression of intracellular bacteria is via a host-targeted mechanism. Currently, studies to evaluate the efficacy of selected AR-12 derivatives on Salmonella-infected mice are underway. Conclusion: The findings provide a proof-of-concept that the antibacterial activity of AR-12 can be dissociated from its antiproliferative activity via structure optimization. AR-12 represents a promising scaffold for the development of novel hosttargeted antibacterial agents for the treatment of salmonellosis. Background: Clinical antibiotic failure may result from bacterial resistance but also from persistent forms of infection. Intracellular bacteria are protected from host immune defences and partly also from antibiotic action. Here, we study the activity of moxifloxacin in a model of intracellular infection of S. aureus (localized in phagolysosomes), comparing a reference strain to clinical isolates collected from patients with persistent infection.",

Static concentrations (C s ) and maximal efficacy (E max ): calculated from Hill equation fitted to concentration-response data (see Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2006,50:841-51). Results: As shown in the table, moxifloxacin C s was always close (1.5-4.2\u00d7) to its MIC for all strains, whatever their susceptibility in broth, but E max was significantly lower (less negative) for clinical isolates compared to reference strain. Conclusion: Intracellular forms of the clinical isolates obtained from patients with persistent infections are significantly less eradicated than the reference strain, suggesting a state of less responsiveness to moxifloxacin in the phagolysosomal environment. A potential link with therapeutic failure in vivo remains to be established.",

Following incubation at 35-37\u00b0C in O 2 for 18-24 hours, colonies selected off drug containing plates were tested to determine MIC and compared to pre-drug exposure MIC values. MIC values identical or within 1 doubling dilution were taken to indicate no impact on the tested strains. For killing, 10 5 cfu/mL of each organism was exposed to 0.01, 0.5, 0.1 Ciprofloxacin DC and log 10 reduction (and % kill) measured at 5,10,15,20,25,30,60,120,180 minutes after drug exposure.

We used the conditional logistic regression model to estimate rate ratios (RRs), adjusting or matching by a disease risk score (DRS). Results: We identified a cohort of 17,510 individuals diagnosed with gastrointestinal perforation and matched them to 1,751,000 controls. Current use of fluoroquinolone was associated with the greatest increase in risk of gastrointestinal perforations after DRS score adjustment (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.62-2.22). The risk of gastrointestinal perforation was attenuated for past (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.20-1.47) and any prior year use (RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.34-1.59). Current use of macrolide, an active comparator, was not associated with a significant increased risk of gastrointestinal perforation (RR, 1.11, 95% CI, 0.15-7.99). To mitigate selection bias, we have also excluded people who have never used fluoroquinolone before or people with infectious colitis, enteritis or gastroenteritis. In both of the analysis, a higher risk of gastrointestinal perforation was still associated with the use of fluoroquinolone. Conclusion: We found that use of fluoroquinolones was associated with a non-negligible increased risk of gastrointestinal perforation, and physicians should be aware of this possible association. Background: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB), especially multidrug-and extensively drug-resistant (M/XDR-) TB are the emerging menace in the world. In recent years, to shorten the time for drug susceptibility testing (DST), the molecular diagnostics become popular. The accuracy of such methods depends on the reliable DST data. Then, we compared the whole genome sequencing (WGS) data with our DST results about 108 M. tuberculosis (MTB) isolates including MDR and XDR, to detect the mutations and evaluate those using the \"all-in-one web-based WGS analysing tool\" and to identify novel resistance responsible mutations.",

Methods: To analysis lncRNAs expression profiles and identify differentially expressed lncRNAs in CD4+ T cells response to T. pallidum infection in neurosyphilis patients. CD4+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RNA extraction was performed to conduct further experiments. Expression profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs in CD4+ T cells isolated from neurosyphilis patients and healthy controls were analyzed by using microarray assay. Four lncRNAs were selected to conduct validation by using real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the expression levels of those above mentioned lncRNAs in neurosyphilis patients and healthy controls were compared. Results: In total, 17, 278 lncRNAs and 15, 840 mRNA were found to be differentially expressed when comparing the CD4+ T cells between neurosyphilis patients and healthy control individuals. Of these transcripts, 2258 lncRNAs and 1728 mRNAs were significantly over or under expressed, respectively. Compared with healthy controls, AC068282.3 (fold change: 21.90) and CTD-3064M3.3 (fold change: 23.93) were the most over-expressed and under-expressed lncRNAs in neurosyphilis patients. The majority of differentially expressed lncRNAs are from intergenic regions (\u223c57.5%), intronic antisense to protein-coding loci (\u223c15.0%), natural antisense to protein-coding loci (\u223c12.1%). It is worth noting that 59 lncRNAs were significant difference along with significantly different mRNA. Among the 59 pairs of genes, LOC7999 mRNA was positively correlated with lncRNA RP11-160E2.16, RP11-160E2.11, RP11-160E2.19, respectively; NKX1-1 mRNA was positively correlated with lncRNA RP11-1398P2.1, RP11-160E2.19, XLOC_003422, respectively. The following five mRNAs were correlated with two differential lncRNAs, namely DUSP16, AP000349.1, FAM115C, TIMM8A, SMCHD1. GO analysis revealed that the differentially expressed coding genes were mainly involved in the biological processes, and among them, the most significant association was observed in defense response to fungus, defense response to bacterium, killing cells of other organism and disruption of cells of other organism. Subsequent pathway analysis was also conducted, and T cell receptor signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, etc. were found out to be associated with differentially expressed mRNAs.",

Background: Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) produced by Campylobacter jejuni contains three subunits: CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC. The interaction of CdtA and CdtC with membrane lipid rafts delivers CdtB into the nucleus, follows by induction of inflammation and cell death. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), one of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), is a nuclear DNAbinding protein that stabilizes nucleosome and promotes DNA repair. Activation of HMGB1 signals is mediated by the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), which is important for defending against bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to explore how CDT regulates HMGB1-mediated autophagy and what DAMP triggers RAGE's mobilization to lipid rafts to induce inflammatory. Methods: The molecular mechanisms underlying CDT regulates autophagy process that conferred cell death and cell cycle arrest were investigated. Biochemical analyses were conducted for exploring DAMP-mediated triggering of RAGE mobilization to lipid rafts in response to CDT-induced inflammation. Results: Our study showed that CDT induces RAGE expression, but suppresses that of HMGB1, indicating that DAMPs other than HMGB1 trigger RAGE activation in the inflammatory response. As the intracellular availability of HMGB1 activates autophagy, our results revealed that CDT controls HMGB1 that is important for regulating autophagy. We also found that DAMPs mobilize RAGE to lipid rafts in response to CDT-induced inflammation.",

Background: One of key pathways employed by the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa to establish pathogenesis is by the formation of biofilms. Apart from biofilm formation, this bacterium is able to produce different virulence factors which will help in drug resistance and nutritional uptake. To overcome this problem, there is a need to establish alternative antimicrobials. Hence, this study was taken up to investigate the antibacterial and antivirulent properties of a flavonoid, quercetin against catheter associated P. aeruginosa. Methods: Selective P. aeruginosa strains were used to evaluate the effect of quercetin at different concentrations in, Bactericidal, biofilm viability, elastase, siderophore, pyocyanin, twitching motility, biofilm. Results: Bactericidal assay showed that, except one clinical strain (YU-V28) all the isolates were completely inhibited by quercetin at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, but quercetin did not show any significant effect on siderophore, pyocyanin and elastase production. The motility assay showed that in all the concentrations the strains formed microbial colony but unable to spread on the plate. Quercetin showed significant inhibitory effect on biofilm formation. At the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL except YU-V28 (OD 580 0.25) all the strains formed weak biofilm (OD 580 0.087-0.174) and at the highest concentration two clinical isolates formed weak biofilm (OD 580 0.12) and other strains were unable to form biofilm. Conclusion: Our study revealed that quercetin has good antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity. We suggest that this compound can be used in treating P. aeruginosa either as food supplement or in developing new antibiotic combinations. Background: Colistin resistance (CR) in Gram negative bacteria is a worldwide concern that increased recently with the discovery and spread of mcr-1 and mcr-2 plasmid-mediated genes. Active efflux is a mechanism that is known in various bacteria to confer resistance to various antibiotics, including tigecyclin, fluoroquinolones and carbapenem. Recently, one efflux pump inhibitor (EPI), the carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) showed an ability to reverse colistin resistance in colistin resistant Gram negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii) with an unknown mechanism of action. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of this EPI on a collection of well defined colistin-resistant strains isolated in our laboratory, including naturally-resistant Gram negative bacteria and acquired-resistant bacteria (mcr-1, mgrB, pmrAB\u2026) Methods: We have compared diameters of inhibition of colistin disk or Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) realized by E-test method on Mueller-Hinton medium (MH) and on MH supplemented with 10 mg/L CCCP. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student test at a risk of 0.05. We studied a collection of 103 strains including 24 mcr-1 CR strains (19 Escherichia coli, 4 K. pneumoniae, 1 Enterobacter cloacae), 6 with a known mechanism of resistance (PmrA, PmrB, mgrB) for which 4 associated with mcr-1, 46 with unknown mechanism (Enterobacter spp., E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Salmonella enterica) and 27 intrinsically resistant Enterobacteriaceae (Serratia marcescens, Proteus spp., Providencia spp. and Morganella morganii). Results: Preliminary results showed a mean increase of colistin diameter of 6.44 \u00b1 2.42 mm in mcr-1 positive strains when CCCP was added to the medium (diameters with colistin disk alone: 14.8 \u00b1 1.66 mm; diameters with colistin disk with CCP: 21.3 \u00b1 2.52; p-value = 1.72.10-13). In S. marcescens, MICs of colistin decrease from >256 mg/L to a mean of 0.132 [0.064; 0.19] mg/L ( p-value = 6.92.10-59). Genomic analysis is ongoing to identify the efflux pump(s) that could be involved in this mechanism of action due to CCCP. Conclusion: Here we show that CCCP, an efflux pump inhibitor, is able to reverse resistance to colistin in all colistin-resistant Gram negative bacteria and that this phenomenon is independent of the mechanism of resistance involved. Since other genes of resistance are implicated in resistance to colistin in these bacteria (mcr-1, mgrB\u2026), this means that efflux pumps play an additional role in resistance to colistin. Genomic analyses are ongoing to identify such pumps that could be further targeted by specific EPIs in the future. This work opens a new area of research for the development of adjunctive therapy for CR bacterial infections.",

Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C Background: N \u03b5 -acetyl-\u03b2-lysine is a ubiquitous compatible solute (osmolyte) among all methanoarchaea to counter the osmotic stress, which is synthesized from lysine through lysine 2,3aminomutase (AblA) to form \u03b2-lysine and the acetyl group is further transferred to \u03b2-lysine by \u03b2-lysine acetyltransferase (AblB). Whole genome sequences of the halophilic methanoarchaeon Methanohalophilus portucalensis FDF1 T revealed that there are two ablA genes; ablA1 and its co-transcribed ablB are responsible for N \u03b5acetyl-\u03b2-lysine synthesis, whereas ablA2 located within translation associated proteins and without ablB. Methods: RNA-seq was performed with Illumina HiSeq 2000. Phylogenetic relationship of AblA2 and 16S rRNA gene from methanogenic archaea and bacteria were constructed with Neighbor-joining method by MEGA 6 program. Both MpAblA1 and MpAblA2 were heterologously overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3)-RIL and further purified by nickel affinity chromatography. And maintained both overexpressed proteins under the reduction state in the dihydrolipoic acid and sodium dithionite buffer. The enzymatic activity assay was determined by \u03b2-lysine production through ultra performance liquid chromatography. Results: Transcriptomic anslysis showed that the transcriptional expression of ablA2 are higher than ablA1 at the optimal growth condition and also under salt stress (29-457 fold) and temperature stress (16-669 fold), which indicated that demand for \u03b2-lysine was higher than compatible N \u03b5 -acetyl-\u03b2-lysine. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid of AblA2 from archaea and bacteria indicated that this halophilic methanoarchaeal ablA2 may be horizontally transferred from Deltaprotebacteria. The amino acid sequence similarity between AblA1 and AblA2 are 41%, AblA2 and lysine 2,3-aminomutase from Desulfuromonadales bacterium C00003107 are 75%. As AblA1, homology modeled structure of AblA2 contains the Fe-S cluster, SAM binding domain, PLP binding site, but the C-terminal zinc binding sites was not found in AblA2. To further investigate the enzyme activities of AblA1 and AblA2, both genes are transformed and overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) RIL, respectively. Both MpAblA1 and A2 proteins were maintained at reduction state with the addition of dihydrolipoic acid and sodium dithionite. And the UPLC system used to identify the end product \u03b2-lysine was established for future AblA1 and A2 enzyme kinetic investigation. Conclusion: Through genomic, transcriptomic and phylogenetic analysis, we identified two lysine 2,3-aminomutases genes (AblA) in Methanoarchaea: which AblA1 functions as compatible solute synthesis gene and AblA2 may function as translational modification that involve in PTM-\u03b2-lysylation.",

            "text": "Background: Widespread accumulations of methane hydrate within the accretionary prism offshore SW Taiwan are postulated to occur based on the presence of the intensity of bottom simulating reflections. Four Way Closure Ridge (FWCR) is one of the sites with intensive methane seepages and the chemosynthetic community with highly dense mussel bed was found. The carbon isotopic composition of fluxed methane indicates the biogenic methane source known only produced by methanoarchaea is dominant in this area. Here we describe the methanoarchaea community in this cold seep area through culture-dependent method. Methods: We used video-guided multi-corer (V-corer) to collect sediment samples in the cold seep area, C5 station at FWCR, during the OR3-1900 cruise of R/V OR3 on 16-20 Nov, 2015. Methanoarchaea in sediment samples were enriched at room temperature using rich media (MB/W) with mixed substrates, including acetate, formate and methanol. The growth of methanoarchaea was monitored by methane production using gas chromatography. Pure or partial pure methanoarchaeal isolates were purified through roll-tube technique and were identified by using phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. Results: Total 4 sediment cores and 30 methanoarchaea enrichments were retrieved from the cold-seep region of the FWCR. After 4 months incubation, 20 bottles of methanoarchaea enrichments contained methane production (\u223c14 to 6900 \u03bcmole/bottle), which indicated that there were methanoarchaea grew inside. And anaerobic roll-tube technique was performed to obtain single colony from the methane produced enrichment samples. Conclusion: Through culture-dependent method, we reveal that dominant methanoarchaea are Methanoculleus strains which occur \u223c73% relative abundance in the cold seep region of FWCR offshore SW Taiwan. This may indicate that Methanoculleus strains are prevailing methane producers in cold seeps. In addition, endemic and potential new species of methanoarchaea from cold seep regions were collected in this study.",

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by NADPH oxidase upon RANKL stimulation, has been demonstrated to play a key role in osteoclast differentiation. Our previous studies have shown that Ganoderma neojaponicum water extract (GNES) increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expression and decreased hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in murine RAW264.7 macrophages.

Besides the chemical methods, 1,3-PD can be produced through fermentation processes of glycerol in certain bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae. Glycerol is metabolized fermentatively to 1,3-PD in bacterial aerobic or anaerobic metabolic pathways. Aerobically, glycerol can be uptaken into bacterial cell through glycerol facilitator protein (GlpF), then will be phosphorylated by glycerol kinase (GlpK) to become glycerol-3-P, for being further metabolized. In Enterobacteriaceae, phosphotransferase system (PTS) protein Enzyme-IIA Glc (also called Crr, for catabolite repression resistance) was found to be the central regulator of carbon metabolism. Unphosphorylated Crr protein can bind to GlpK to inhibit its function. In previous study we found that KPN00353, a novel KpEIIA, could inhibit 1,3-PD production in Klebsiella pneumoniae by direct binding to GlpK. Based on the protein-protein interaction site prediction, amino acid residue Histidine-65 (His-65) is predicted to be the important residue for KpGlpK-KPN00353 binding. Several mutations at His-65 of KPN00353 were designed in order to mimic either unphosphorylation or phosphorylation of KPN00353 protein. We found that the unphosphorylated KPN00353 could bind stronger to KpGlpK than the phosphorylated form, resulting in higher nonuptaken glycerol concentration in the used medium and lower 1,3-PD production. Background: Proteus mirabilis is a common human pathogen causing urinary tract infections (UTIs), especially in patients with indwelling urinary catheters. Many regulatory mechanisms have been evolved for bacteria to adapt to changes of diverse environments. Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are known to contribute to bacterial pathogenicity by exerting toxic effects on host cells or competing bacterial species and are involved in a broad variety of functions such as biofilm formation and stress sensing. This large array of functions is reflected by a diversity of regulatory mechanisms. The regulation of P. mirabilis T6SS remains unclear. Recently, our transcriptome analysis revealed P. mirabilis T6SS was regulated by many regulators. Methods: We first confirmed the regulation of T6SS by regulators using real-time RT-PCR and the promoter reporter assay and identified one T6SS main structure operon and four Hcp/VgrG effector operons in P. mirabilis N2 by using sequence specific RT and then PCR. We investigated whether the regulators can bind directly to T6SS promoter region using a DNaseI footprinting assy. Overexpression of the effector toxin was performed to disclose its function. The growth predominance test and killing assay were used to observe the competition between wild type and the regulator mutant. We contructed vipAB (encoding the T6SS sheath) mutant to confirm the regulator-mediated killing of T6SS. We also purified the possible toxin to assess its function in E. coli killing. Results: Many regulators positively regulated T6SS by binding directly to T6SS promoter region and also positively regulated the expression of the effector toxins. Overexpression of the effector toxin in wild-type P. mirabili resulted in increased killing of regulator mutants and E. coli. Accordingly, the growth predominance test and killing assay demonstrated that P. mirabilis T6SS conferred growth predominance on the wild-type over regulator mutants and E. coli. Conclusion: The expression of P. mirabilis T6SS was positively regulated by many regulators, which affected its killing function. T6SS contributed to growth predominance over regulator mutants and E. coli, suggesting P. mirabilis T6SS as an antibacterial weapon. Background: Rapid diagnosis of Bacteremia is critical for sepsis patients. The new generation blood culture system, VirtuO\u2122, possesses fully automatic functions including sign-in, loading and unloading bottles which reduce hands on time and is easy to operate for hospital staffs. To improve the delay-entry into blood culture system for the specimens in the evening and night shifts for lacking manpower to run a 24-hour microbiology service, VirtuO\u2122 was introduced into a emergency room (ER) of a Taiwan hospital that allows nursing staffs to load blood culture bottles immediately after collection in day, evening and nigh shifts. The benefit of the intervention in turnaround time (TAT) of blood culture was investigated. Methods: The study was conducted in a 1500-bed hospital. The efficacy of introducing VirtuO\u2122 into ER was compared to an existed procedure that blood culture specimens were loaded into BacT/ Alert 3D system only in the day-shift in a microbiology Lab with regards to TAT from medical order to detection time for evening and night shifts specimens. Results: Application of VirtuO\u2122 in ER has achieved the following results. First, The time from medical order to blood culture bottle loading into incubator shortened for 13.7 hours in average. Second, TAT from medical order to positive detection in 90% positive cultures when VirtuO\u2122 in ER were within 43.3 hrs, while this TAT in 90% positive cultures for the previous procedure with only BacT/Alert 3D in microbiology laboratory were within 55.7 hrs. Third, 56% VirtuO\u2122 bottles were positive in 24 hours, while 19% in previous BacT/Alert 3D procedure were positive in 24 hours. Conclusion: VirtuO\u2122 is an automated blood culture system and easy to operate for ER staffs. Introducing VirtuO\u2122 in ER solves the problem of delayed entry including the time for transportation of blood culture bottles from ER to microbiology room and avoids the need of manpower for transportation in evening and night shifts, while loading blood specimens into blood culture system can be performed immediately. The intervention resulted in faster blood culture results, and therefore would be helpful for treatment of sepsis patients and antibiotic stewardship. Background: Tedizolid phosphate 200mg, once-daily, 6-day treatment has been demonstrated to be non-inferior to linezolid 600 mg, twice-daily, 10-day treatment in patients with ABSSSI, which was further investigated in a multicentre phase 3 study in a predominantly Asian population. Methods: Adult patients with ABSSSI (i.e. cellulitis/erysipelas, major abscess, or wound infection), due to suspected/confirmed Gram-positive pathogen, were randomised to receive intravenous/ oral (IV/PO) once-daily tedizolid phosphate (200 mg, 6 days) or IV/ PO twice-daily linezolid (600 mg, 10 days). The primary endpoint was early clinical response rate based on \u226520% lesion size reduction at 48-72 hours after treatment initiation in the intent-to-treat (ITT [all randomised]) population. Non-inferiority was predefined as the lower limit of 95% confidence interval (CI) for the betweentreatment difference was greater than -10%. Results: Patients (N = 598) from Mainland China, Taiwan, Philippines, and the USA were randomised: N = 300 and N = 298 in tedizolid and linezolid arms, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar between tedizolid and linezolid arms regarding mean age (45.7 years, 47.5 years), proportion of Asian patients (63.7%, 64.8%), males (69.7%, 64.4%), and cellulitis/erysipelas (64.0%, 64.1%), respectively. As for the primary endpoint, the treatment difference was -4.6% (95% CI: -11.2%; 2.2%). In the modified ITT population (mITT; excluding patients without taking any dose of study drug [tedizolid: n = 8, linezolid: n = 1]), the treatment difference was -2.7%, with the lower and upper limits of 95% CI as -9.4% and 3.9%. Secondary endpoints including clinical response rate at end-of-therapy (EOT) and investigator's assessment of clinical success at post-therapy evaluation (PTE) showed high clinical efficacy in ITT and clinically evaluable (CE) populations. Microbiological eradication rates were favourable for both treatments, including MRSA infections (tedizolid: 72.4%, linezolid: 62.5%). Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) rates for tedizolid and linezolid were 49.7% and 45.8%, and drug-related TEAEs were 20.9% and 15.8%, respectively. Drug-related injection site phlebitis was slightly more frequent with tedizolid (n = 8) than linezolid (n = 0). Discontinuations due to TEAEs were \u223c2% in each arm. No deaths were reported. Conclusion: Non-inferiority of 6 days of IV-to-oral, once-daily 200 mg tedizolid phosphate to 10 days of IV-to-oral, twice-daily 600mg linezolid in early clinical response was inconclusive at 48-72 hours after treatment initiation. Tedizolid showed consistent high clinical efficacy at the later timepoints (EOT and PTE) comparable with the pivotal ESTABLISH studies1. Tedizolid was highly efficacious against MRSA infections and was well tolerated.",

Hypervirulent toxinotype III BI/NAP1/027 strain of C. difficile was easily found in the North America, but only three cases were previously described in Taiwan. Metronidazole and vancomycin are used as first-line treatment for CDI. As refractory/severe CDI becomes more frequent and the drug of choice, fidaxomicin, is not available in most hospitals in many countries, we may need to consider an alternative treatment, such as tigecycline, for NAP1/BI/027 strain CDI. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with diagnosis of CDI confirmed by stool culture, Ag testing or PCR, from January 2016 to March 2017 in a tertiary hospital in eastern Taiwan. GeneXpert C. difficile/Epi Assay was used to identify NAP1/BI/027 strain CDI in selective cases when the physicians in charge felt necessary. Results: A total of 71 cases were diagnosed with CDI. Among them, two were identified as NAP1/BI/027 strain CDI by GeneXpert, both were also confirmed by culture. Both of our cases can be classified as severe complicated CDI because they had consciousness change accompanied with severe bandemia. Both failed to conventional combination treatment with metronidazole and vancomycin. As a result, intravenous tigecycline treatment was prescribed as an adjunctive therapy. Both of our patient recovered uneventfully from this hypervirulent strain. The successful results were shown by sigmoidoscopy before and after tigecycline treatment in one patient (Figure) . Conclusion: In this study, the advantage of adding tigecycline to standard treatment of NAP1/BI/027 strain CDI was clearly manifested. Tigecycline combined with either metronidazole or vancomycin appears to be a reasonable therapy for severe and severe-complicated CDI.",

Further, E. faecium strains with high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of daptomycin (DAP) have recently been a problem in clinical practice. This study aimed to assess the predictor factors and prognosis of patients with bacteremia due to E. faecium and the antimicrobial susceptibility focusing on DAP against E. faecium isolates. Methods: The medical records of 60 patients with E. faecalis bacteremia and 48 patients with E. faecium bacteremia who had been admitted to Osaka City University Hospital between January 2011 and March 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient backgrounds, predictor factors for infection, prognosis, and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from bacteremia were evaluated. Results: The mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and the mortality did not differ between the two groups. However, independent predictors associated with E. faecium bacteremia in the multivariate analysis were the use of quinolones ( p = 0.025), malignancy ( p = 0.021), and prolonged hospitalization ( p = 0.016). Cardiovascular disease was the opposite predictor ( p = 0.015). Further, the number of E. faecium isolates with DAP MIC \u22653 was more than that of E. faecalis ( p = 0.036). Conclusion: Careful use of DAP is crucial when administering therapy for E. faecium bacteremia. Background: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome, which was first described in 1920, is defined as perihepatitis concomitant with pelvic inflammatory disease. Chlamydia trachomatis is considered the culprit pathogen. This syndrome usually features with right upper quadrant abdominal pain mimicking other hepatobiliary diseases, posing a clinically diagnostic challenge. Case report: A 29-year-old female was admitted because of fever, chills, persistent right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and vaginal discharge. The laboratory data revealed leukocytosis with neutrophils predominant. On admission, the abdominal CT revealed mild right side pelural effusion, and a 3.8-cm-sized mass lesion below the cecum. The transvaginal ultrasound indicated fluid accumulation in the pelvic cul de sac, and bilateral adnexa mass, favouring endometrioma. The serum serology revealed Chlamydia trachomatis IgA positive. Clinical and laboratory findings were suggestive of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome. Two weeks after treatment with intravenous Flumarin and Clinicin, the patient showed significant clinical improvement. Conclusion: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome should be included as a differential diagnosis in women with right upper quadrant pain, especially at their reproductive ages.",

In Taiwan, cases of severe influenza with IPA are increasingly reported. Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) antigen assay greatly facilitates early diagnosis in high-risk patients. However, GM antigen could be positive in infections caused by other filamentous fungi, such as Penicillium and Curvularia species, and careful clinical correlation is advised. Methods: A 58 y/o man of COPD had fever and productive cough for 2-3 days. He denied other systemic disease. Dyspnea on exertion (like climbing stairs), wheezing sound and mild chest tightness were noted. He was brought to our ER, where his temperature was 39.7 degree Celsius and BP was 141/116 mm Hg. Emergent intubation with mechanical ventilation was performed for impending respiratory failure. Lab data revealed leukocytosis, elevated lactate level (8.8 mmole/L), and mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. Influenza A antigen was positive. PCR methods confirmed FluA but different to H1N1 and H3N2. CXR showed emphysematous change with mild infiltration in both lungs. Hypotension occurred at ER, so fluid resuscitation with inotropic agent infusion was used.

Blood Aspergillus GM antigen index was >9.24 (normal index, <0.5). Therefore, voriconazole was initiated. Another sputum culture yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica. Antibiotic was shifted to imipenem and tigecycline. However, dyspnea became air-hunger pattern. CXR showed bilateral consolidation in progression, compatible with acute respiratory distress syndrome. He developed profound shock status and was expired after 10 days of hospitalization. Conclusion: Aspergillus GM positive has been found in patients with severe influenza in Taiwan. We first report positive Aspergillus GM testing in a severe influenza patient with Curvularia infection. Early diagnosis and management for IPA is important. Treatment of Curvularia infection usually consists of amphotericin B or itraconazole. Voriconazole also appears promising. Our case highlights that positive Aspergillus GM testing could occur in other invasive fungal infection. Therefore, GM assay must be interpreted with caution due to cross reactions to other fungi, which might need different antifungal therapy. Background: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) might comprise up to 23-29% of severe influenza patients. In Taiwan, epidemiological association of severe influenza with IPA has been reported. Meanwhile, prior high-level ambient fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres (PM 2.5 ) before influenza epidemic was also noticed. However, detailed evidence of epidemiological linkage between PM 2.5 and IPA has been limited. Therefore, we compare the correlation of PM 2.5 (as monthly average level) by different exposure periods and critical level to the development of IPA among severe influenza and non-influenza patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed adult patients with severe influenza in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan from January 2015 through March 2016. The definition of probable IPA required abnormal radiological findings and positive Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) antigen and/or Aspergillus isolation. Platelia Aspergillus Ag EIA (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes-La-Coquette, France) was used to detect GM in blood with a positive cut-off value of \u22650.5 index. PM 2.5 as an index of ambient air pollution in Tainan city was obtained from Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network. Spearman's correlation was used to measure the strength of epidemiological association between two variables. Results: A total of 124 patients with severe influenza were found during the study period. Monthly average PM 2.5 level and exposure to monthly critical level of >30 \u03bcg/m 3 within previous 1-2 months has significant correlation with the development of IPA in severe influenza patients, but has no significant correlation with IPA in non-influenza patients (Table) . Influenza cases significantly increased when average PM 2.5 exceeded critical level during prior 1st month. Conclusion: PM 2.5 exposure within previous 1-2 months, particularly above critical level, may be positively correlated with the development of IPA in the setting of severe influenza. Results: Among these 7 cases, only one patient was more than 65 years old, and 5 patients were female (71.4%). Clinical manifestations include life threatening encephalitis, pneumonitis, generalized lymphadenopathy and multi-organ involvement. Two patients received PCR for Toxoplasma; one showed positive result (50%). Two patients was confirmed to have HIV infection (28.5%). Two patients had fever or sepsis during the course, one of them presented with brain lesions. Four patients (57%) presented with multiple lymphadenopathy. Three patients with CNS involvement had ICU stay for one to two months, with one mortality; alsoToxoplasma antibodies were undetectable in two of these three cases. In the two cases taking IFN-\u03b3 profile study, anti-IFN-\u03b3 auto-antibodies were not detected in plasma; however, IFN-\u03b3 levels in whole blood were both lower compared with control group, which might be indicative of immune deficiency.",

This infection involved the brain, lung and skin, and was eventually fatal. Methods: A 45-year-old male Chinese Singaporean resident was diagnosed with T-cell ALL in October 2016. He was treated with the first cycle of hyper-CVAD regimen and intrathecal cytarabine with fluconazole prophylaxis. His treatment was complicated by a linerelated bloodstream infection and intermittent confusion. MRI brain showed several ring-enhancing lesions. CT thorax showed nodules with cavitation.",

He underwent bronchoalveolar lavage, lumbar puncture and brain biopsy but these were not diagnostic. 3 weeks later, a repeat MRI brain and CT thorax demonstrated improvement of the lesions. He was continued on the second cycle of hyper-CVAD in December 2016. Unfortunately, he deteriorated 1 day later with another line-related infection and new nodules on repeat MRI brain. Again, brain biopsy did not yield a diagnosis. The patient became progressively obtunded and was commenced on empiric pyrimethamine, clindamycin, folinic acid, meropenem and liposomal amphotericin B. He then developed new skin nodules which were biopsied. Histology revealed broad-appearing fungal hyphae. The patient succumbed to the infection a few days later.",

Conclusion: Our patient may have partially responded to the switch in prophylaxis from fluconazole to posaconazole, which paradoxically may have made the diagnosis more difficult. This patient's infection resembled other forms of invasive fungal infections with lung-brain syndrome and skin involvement. On histopathologic examination, it was difficult to distinguish Volvariella volvacea from other invasive moulds. The key to managing this infection is in obtaining tissue diagnosis by microbiology, assisted by molecular sequencing techniques. Volvariella volvacea is an emerging and potentially fatal cause of invasive fungal infection in patients with haematologic malignancies, for which prompt diagnosis and treatment is crucial.",

The examination of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed negative finding. The pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of Staphylococcus warneri of the strain 1 ( peripheral blood) and strain 2 (ascites) showed the same identical pattern (Figure 1 ). Figure 1 : The pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of Staphylococcus warneri of the strain 1 (peripheral blood) and the strain 2 (ascites) showed the same identical pattern. Conclusion: Pulmonary aspergillosis was proved. However, the tissue prove of brain and liver was not performed due to patient's will and complication. However, the patient's condition and image study showed improve after the Voriconazole was prescribed. Hence, the invasive aspergillosis involve lung, liver and brain was highly suspect. Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is more common in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with higher mortality than in Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV disease may occur in ESRD patients without the presence of overt immunodeficiency. The gastrointestinal tract is the most common site of involvement. Clinicians should be aware of this possibility in ESRD patients who have GI symptoms. We reported a case of ESRD with regular hemodialysis (HD) accompanied with severe GI bleeding by CMV colitis. Case report: This 70 years old female had a past history of ESRD on regular HD. This time, she suffered from coffee ground and vomiting tonight. His husband said she recived HD program with weight loss only one kilogram yesterday. Due to above reasons, she was sent to emergency room (ER) for help. At ER, laboratory data showed severe hyperkalemia, with atrial flutter and coffee ground. Emergency HD was done, then she was then admitted for intensive care ward due to coronary artery disease with three veneral disease (CAD with 3-V-D), and intermittent tachy-bradycardia. After ICU, blood transfusion was performed and high dose protonpump inhibitor (PPI) infusion were also performed. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGI endoscopy) was was done, which showed gastric ulcers, antrum, with bleeding, post hemoclips; duodenal ulcers. Electrocardiogram revealed T wave -inversion so echocardiography and cardiologist was consulted due to CAD with 3-V-D, with the suspicious of non STelevation myocardial infarction due to anemia. However, echocardiography showed no evidence of hypokinease so medication use after clinical condition improved. Chest X-ray showed right upper lobe consolidation, and sputum culture was Acinetobacter baumannii. So we added antibiotics with ceftazidime plus vancomycin for infection control. We informed the condition to her family and repeated UGI endoscopy due to high risk for rebleeding. Due to easy bleeding and positive CMV-polymerase chain reaction in gastric fluid was noted. GI bleeding was stopped after ganciclovir infusion for two days. General condition got much better, so we shifted iv form ganciclovir to valganciclovir from 2016/11/29 to 2016/12/05 and she was discharged on 2016/12/05. Discussion: CMV can be established as a potential infection, which can lead to reactivation with immunosuppression. It can affect almost any organ system, gastrointestinal tract involvement is the most common. Because of the rare occurrence of CMV-associated fatal multiple gastric and duodenal bleeding, high index suspicion is needed in immunocompromised patients with gastrointestinal bleeding for early diagnosis and possible beneficial outcomes.",

He was newly diagnosed AIDS two weeks before and transferred to our hospital for further treatment. On physical examination the patient appeared weak and thin. His temperature was 38.5\u00b0C, with a pulse 105 beats per minute, respiration rate 21 per minute. Laboratory studies revealed hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, leukocyte count 1,310/\u03bcL, platelet count 45,000/\u03bcL, AST 165 IU/L, ALT 96 IU/L, CD4 count 0/mm 3 , and HIV viral load 3,570 copies/mL. Abdominal to pelvic CT showed splenomegaly, enlarged retroperitoneal, mesenteric LNs and massive amount of ascites. Lung CT showed consolidation at left lower lung field with pleural effusion. Opportunistic infection surveys were negative except PCR assays for herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus from blood and bronchial alveolar lavage were both positive. Lymph node biopsy was not feasible due to severe thrombocytopenia. We managed to perform bone marrow aspiration and biopsy after platelet transfusion which showed hypocellular marrow with marrow content less than 5% and negative for malignancy. Patient's condition deteriorated and he was transferred for hospice care. Results: Six weeks later, the TB culture of the peripheral blood showed growth of mold. The microorganism was subsequently identified as H. capsulatum by PCR assay. Blood culture and fungal culture were reported as sterile after one and two week incubation period. Bone marrow biopsy was revised with GMS stain which showed numerous intracellular yeast-like micro-organisms, consistent with histoplasmosis ( Figure A) . Conclusion: Histoplasmosis is rarely seen in Taiwan and only a limited number of cases had been reported. It could be missed by laboratories if incubation for recovery of fungi is shorter than four to six weeks. It would be advisable for laboratories to review their culture policies and extend fungal culture incubation to at least four weeks or more. Slow growing mold would be underestimated by a short incubation time for fungus in service laboratory.",

Histology analysis of the biopsy (Figure 1 ) revealed focal spotty necrosis and swelling of hepatocytes with lymphocytic satellitosis, compatible with mild acute hepatitis and mild portal area fibrosis. Noncirrhotic portal hypertension was diagnosed. Background: Voriconazole is an antifungal medicine by killing the growth of the fungi that cause infections. It is usually used for the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis, especially for chemotherapy patients to their infectious diseases. Voriconazole has a nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile with wide inter-and intra individual variability. High total voriconazole concertration also induce the toxicity in live, and unbounded form is more poisonous in sepsis patients. And in the hypoalbuminemia patient, we use fomula to adjust total voriconazole concertration. So the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring is important for patient avoiding the toxicity in liver. In this study, we intended to establish a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method for clinical diagnostic purpose. Methods: By using multiple reaction mornitoring (MRM) of tandem mass analysis, the mass-to-charge (m/z) of the precursor and the product ions of voriconazole was 350.3/172.4. The internal standard, a ketocozole, was used for the calibration and basis of quantitative measurement. The m/z of ketocozole was 531.1/82.1.

Paired Toxoplasma immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G were negative. The brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed enlargement of the right frontal lesion. The whole body positron emission tomography showed multiple brain lesions, mainly right cerebrum with mass effect and a tiny nodule in the posterior segment of right upper lung. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim treatment was initiated for possible cerebral toxoplasmosis. Then, the patient had hyperkalemia and was transferred to surgical intensive care unit. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim treatment was immediately discontinued. The patient had craniotomy with removal of the tumor, and had hemodialysis after the operation. However, the patient had septic shock, and his condition went downhill. He was discharged due to terminal status 4 days later (on hospital day 22). Tachyzoites were found in the necrotic brain tissue. Special stain including periodic acid-Schiff stain, Grocott's methenamine silver stain and Toxoplasma immunohistochemistry staining confirmed toxoplasmosis ( Figure 1 ). Conclusion: Long term immunosuppressants after kidney transplantation led to immunodeficiency in our patient, which became the risk factor of the infection of Toxoplasma gondii.

Results: This is a 41 years old man with diagnosis of HIV. He was admitted the hospital due to bilateral pneumonia with septic shock on August 6, 2016. With inotropic agent used, unstable oxygenation and rapid acute respiratory distress syndrome, he received endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation. Laborartoy data revealed a HIV viral load test of 302,695 copies/mL; CD4+, 5%; CD8+, 61%; CD4+/CD8+ ratio, 0.09; and a Mycoplasma pneumoniae Ab titer of 1:80. Chest X-ray showed ill-definded ground-glass opacities in bilateral lung fields, predominantly in central lung zone and upper lobes, PJ-associated pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was condiered. After admission, antibiotic therapy was used, including piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin for possible bacterial pneumonia. TMP/SMZ was initiated for probable PCP. As intensive care was continued, the thrombocytopenia around 11\u223c19 \u00d7 10 3 /uL persisted, even pneumonia seemed better. Piperacillin/tazobactam was changed to cefpirome. However, persistent thrombocytopenia was still noted. We checked his blood CMV-PCR and result was positive. Sputum CMV-PCR was also positive and a CMV viral load was 1,216 IU/mL, so ganciclovir was added for CMV infection. After that treatment, the thrombocytopenia was improved to 76\u223c97 \u00d7 103/uL. Solumedrol was tapered to solucortef and then oral prednisolone by standard dosing regimen. Extubation was performed on August 25, and recover well. Antibiotic therapy was shifted to oral forms of levofloxacin, TMP/SMZ and valganciclovir. He was discharged uneventfully on September 3, 2016. Conclusion: PCP remains the most common disorder at the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in a HIV patient. Coinfection with CMV is a poor prognostic sign in a setting of PCP. CMV-related organ disease should be suspected in patients with CD4+ cell number lower than 50/\u03bcL. After suscessful antipneumocystis treatment with steroid therapy, our patient still presented with severe thrombocytopenia, which led to secondary diagnosis of CMV syndrome. Other cases may experience worsening pulmonary infection due to CMV pneumonitis by the use of steroids, which therapy should be careful in the patients with a high HIV viral load and low CD4 count. However, tachypnea and fever were noted on post-operative day 4. Additionally, AST/ALT, TBI/DBL were all elevated two folds. He was reintubated and Imipenem was administrated as empiric antibiotic agent. A day later, seizure attacked twice; and Imipenem was shifted to Meropenem. The following lab exam showed DIC. CT scan revealed portal vein thrombosis occuping 50% of lumen and massive pleural effusion. Sputum and blood culture sample grew candida. The initial impression was hepatic failure and candidiasis. The patient expired two weeks later due to multiple organ failure. At autopsy, liver showed central cholestasis and bile canalicular cholestasis. In the liver specimen token via surgery, there were hepatocellular carcinoma and portal area inflammation without the cholestasis, which indicates post hepatectomy liver failure. Leptospirosis was confirmed in the samples of liver, kidney, bone marrow, lung, brain and soft tissue based on strongly postive Warthin Starry stain and Leptospira antibody.",

Background: Mycobacterium abscessus subspecies massiliense is one of the three subspecies of the M. abscessus complex (MABC). It is the most important cause of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections by rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM). MABC is considered highly drug-resistant; it is extremely difficult to treat and often incurable. Prosthetic joint infection due to M. abscessus subsp. massiliense is rare, and optimal therapy remains unknown. Methods: A 48-year-old male with history of gout and prolonged corticosteroid treatment presented with left hip pain with instability and limited range of motion for one month in Sep., 2014. Hip X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan at another hospital revealed findings consistent with avascular necrosis of the left femoral head, and he underwent left total hip arthroplasty. He required reduction for subluxation of the prosthesis the next day. He was admitted again two weeks later for an open revisi\u00f3n to repair a recurrent subluxation of the prosthesis. Within one month of the first surgery, he underwent a third surgery (trochanter advancement osteotomy) for prothesis dislocation. One year later the patient had a one month history of bulging cyst at the left hip. The left hip cyst was felt to be a hematoma, but NTM was isolated from the culture of the cyst fluid. The isolate grew in subculture within 6 days of inoculation, and was considered as a RGM. Anti-NTM treatment was started empirically with azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and doxycycline. Results: The isolate was later identified as M. abscessus subsp. massiliense, susceptible only to clarithromycin and tigecycline. Anti-interferon-\u03b3 autoantibodies were negative. The patient stopped anti-NTM treatment by himself after a one-month therapy, and was discharged against medical advice. The patient experienced recurrent pain of the left hip a few months later, and developed a draining sinus tract. Pus grew M. abscessus subsp. massiliense. After removal of the prosthesis, anti-NTM treatment was re-started with intravenous tigecycline, clarithromycin, clofazimine and amikacin. The patient again stopped anti-NTM therapy due to nausea, malaise, anorexia, weight loss, acute kidney injury and liver dysfunction. Symptoms improved after discontinuing clofazimine and tigecyline. The same symptoms appeared after rechallenge with clofazimine and tigecycline. Finally, the patient was placed on oral suppressive anti-NTM treatment with Results: Serotype Ia was the most common in patients less than 72 hours old, whereas III the most common in patients older than 72 hours. In early-onset disease (0-6 days), Ia and III each caused 27.5% of the infection, followed by Ib (14.5%). In late-onset disease (7-89 days), serotype III predominated (75.3%), followed by Ia (10.1%) and Ib (6.8%). Thirty-one episodes (17%) were complicated with culture-confirmed meningitis. We compared serotype Ia and III patients, and found that serotype Ia patients were significantly younger (median age, 3 days), had higher male percentage, more perinatal maternal fever, and higher mortality. The survival curve of patients with serotype III infections was significantly better than those with non-type III infections. ST17 and ST19 were exclusively found in serotype III, while ST23 and ST24 comprised of 85% of serotype Ia. Conclusion: Serotype Ia caused invasive infections in younger infants with higher mortality than serotype III. A trivalent (Ia, Ib, III) GBS vaccine might prevent 69.6% of early-onset disease, 92.2% of late-onset disease, and 91.3% of GBS meningitis in Taiwan.",

The early use of anticoagulation can reduce morbidity and mortality in CST. Corticosteroid treatments for CST remain controversial. Background: Acute febrile illness (AFI) is a very common syndrome and also represents the most frequent admission diagnose in our service. Even though this syndrome has always been conventionally included as a major indicator of an infectious disease, sometimes it takes big effort to estabilish an etiologic diagnose. Therefore, many patients with AFI are empirically diagnosed, according to clinical manifestations and certain epidemiological (like sessonal strokes, proffesional exposure, traveling.) No wonder why clinicians are always focused on clinical-epidemiologicalbinom, considering the dynamic changes of infectious nosologies in Global Era. Methods: 1455 patients hospitalized to the Infectious Disesase Hospital during 2007-2015. All patients had the same inclusion patterns and also astandardized clinicaland laboratory evaluation of all patients who met the following case criteria: (1) >14 years of age and admitted to the participating institution; (2) history of fever for at least two days; (3) temperature at admission >38\u00b0C (oral or rectal); (4) no identified cause of fever ( physicians were instructed to exclude other causes of fever such as diarrhea, hepatitis, cough and/or symptoms of respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, rheumatic fever, abscess, and/or any other known cause of fever). Admitted patients with AFI provided anamnestic data, epidemiological details and a blood sample for bacterial culture and serologic analysis. Risk factors included animal contact and consumption of raw dairy products, which were significantly associated with brucellosis, exposure to vectors in endemic areas,professional exposure and travels outside the country. Results: Case definitions were based on laboratory results. On 1455 patients evaluated between 2007 and 2015, 41% were positive for Brucella, 5% had positive hemocultures for Bacterial Endocarditis (with predominance of staphyloccouccus aureus), 16% for Riketcia and other tick borne pathogens, 3% for Hemorrhagic fever, 10 for Infectious Mononucleosis, 3% for Malaria, 8.3% for Leishmaniasis and 12.5% for Leptospirosis. Conclusion: Our survey identified several important pathogens; each one of them with an important specific percentage. The correlation of these pathogens to the specific clinical manifestation and epidemiological data allowed a better recognition of these infectious nosologies features in our country, and may also lead to the development of targeted prevention strategies. Background: Acinetobacter baumannii is an important pathogen of nosocomial bloodstream infection and pneumonia, which accounts for high morbidity and mortality rates. However, studies regaring the optimal treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremic pneumonia are limited. Methods: We conducted this retrospective study from January 2012 to December 2015 at 4 medical centres in Taiwan to compare the efficacy of colistin-based and sulbactam-based therapy for A. baumannii bacteremic pneumonia. The clinical features and outcomes of patients were investigated. Results: During the study periods, 71 patients received either colistin-based or sulbactam-based treatment. Among them, 2 patients who received concomitant treatment with colistin and sulbactam were excluded. Twenty-five patients who received colistin-based therapy and 44 who received sulbactam-based therapy were included in final analysis. There was no difference of baseline characteristics, 14-day mortality, 28-day mortality, and overall in-hospital mortality between the 2 groups. Those with ventilator-associated pneumonia were more likely to receive colistin-based treatment rather than sulbactam-base treatment (odds ratio [OR], 7.935; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.157-29.187; p = 0.002). The only risk factor independentlyassociated with higher 14-day and 28-day mortality of A. baumannii bacteremic pneumonia is a higher APACHE II score (OR, 1.105; 95% CI, 1.024-1.192; p = 0.01 and OR, 1.127; 95% CI, 1.044-1.217; p = 0.02, respectively).",

Background: Necrotizing fasciitis was rapidly progressive and lifethreatening. Surgical intervention and broad-spectrum antibiotics usage were very important. But no bacterial was proven in some patients with necrotizing fasciitis. This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the clinical presentation and outcome for patients with this disease differ for those infected with culturenegative as compared to culture-positive pathogen. Methods: One-hundred and forty-three patients with necrotizing fasciitis were examined prospectively from April 2015 to May 2017. All patients received prompt radical debridement, adequate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and aggressive resuscitation. Thirty-eight patients were infected with culture-negative pathogen (Group 1) and 105 patients with culture-positive pathogen (Group 2). Results: Group 2 was male predominated. Group 1 was characterized by a lower incidence of tachypnea and local pain/tenderness, lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, a lower rate of bandemia, bacteremia, lactate acidosis, hypoalbuminemia and a lower prevalence of alcoholism plus diabetes mellitus. A higher rate of acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure and higher admission rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission were more common in Group 2. In a multivariate analysis, male (odds ratio (OR): 0.443, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.199-0.986), local pain/tenderness (OR: 0.144, 95% CI: 0.029-0.722) and tachypnea (OR: 0.275, 95% CI: 0.092-0.824) were identified as infected with culture-positive pathogen. Conclusion: Culture-positive necrotizing fasciitis mostly presented with local pain/tenderness, tachypnea, and men predominate. There were no difference about mortality rates, limbs amputation rate, hospital stay, and ICU stay. We still need more data to confirm those above findings in our hospital. cirrhosis or diabetes.

She was admitted for sepsis, recurrent urinary tract infection. However, after 6 days of antibiotic therapy with Doripenem (500 mg every 8 hours) as an empirical therapy for ESBL-E. coli and target therapy for P. aeruginosa. she had light yellow turbid urine with lots of necrotic debris, low-grade fever, increased dose of insulin to control hyperglycemia, and aggravated leukocytosis. Foley urine culture yielded C. glabrata. After high dose Fluconazole (6 mg/kg/day), Foley catheter obstruction developed, partially relieved by manual irrigation and Foley catheter revision. Amphotericin B continuous irrigation (50 mg every day) via 3-way Foley catheter was applied as salvage therapy, but the frequency of Foley catheter obstruction caused by necrotic debris progressed from every day to every several hours. She had acute obstructive uropathy, complicated by retrograde vancomycin resistant E. faecium septicemia. After Daptomycin (10 mg/kg/day) therapy, vancomycin resistant E.faecium septicemia was resolved without infective endocarditis. Amphotericin B continuous irrigation was replaced by systemic fluconazole (4 mg/kg/day) combined with flucytosine (40 mg/kg/day, divided in 4 doses) therapy.

However, infection is still a significant cause of morbidity and the leading cause of death in patients with myeloma. The increased susceptibility of patients with myeloma to infection not only results from the antineoplastic therapies but also age-and disease related immunodeficiency. Methods: A 66-year-old businessperson was informed stage II chronic renal impairment possibly due to uncontrolled hypertension for two years. He suffered from bilateral flank pain and urinary urgency for one week prior to admission and treated with oral antibiotics under the impression of urinary tract infection at local clinic. He had fever, chills, and altered mental status one day prior to admission. On presentation, the patient had unclear consciousness, confusion to stupor, with E4V2M4. Brain CT revealed mild cortical brain atrophy. CSF studies showed slightly turbid appearance, with orange color, low sugar (CSF glucose: 6 mg/dL, vs normal blood sugar: 102 mg/dL) and high protein (Total protein-CSF: 431.7 mg/dL).

Methods: Patient was a 35-year-old male with history of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) with resolution 9 years ago, but he often had \"hemoptysis\" since then. He was admitted due to progressive \"hemoptysis\" and general soreness. Laboratory data showed influenza A&B antigen, Aspergillus antigen and acid-fast stain all negative. Mycoplasma IgM was positive. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed sporadic fibroinfiltration at both lung and \"ball in cage\" feature at right upper lung. He was treated with clarithromycin and tranesamic acid. Bronchoscopy revealed \"active bleeding\", ( Figure) and bronchial alveolar lavage showed Aspergillus antigen positive. Therefore, voriconazole treatment was added. However, 3 days after discharge, he came back due to massive \"hemoptysis\" of 150 mL. Associated symptoms were dyspnea, dizziness and right upper chest pain. Results: S. marcescens was grown in sputum culture on admission, but he was still treated as aspergillosis. Chest X ray showed right upper lung atelectasis. Right upper lobectomy was performed, and patholgy revealed chronic abscess, no granuloma, and surprizingly no evidence of fungal infection or active tuberculosis. So, voriconazole was shifted to piperacillin/tazobactam. However, he had a fever of 37.9\u00b0C, tachycardia and leukocytosis. S. marcescens was again grown in sputum culture with mixed flora. S. marcescens lung abscess was the final diagnosis, and \"hemoptysis\" was considered as \"pseudo-hemoptysis\" when repeat sputum grew the same organism which could produce prodiogiosum, mimicking fresh blood. Repeat chest CT showed severe adhesion without adequate expansion. Therefore, piperacillin/tazobactam was shifted to levofloxaxin, and the patient had right lower lung superior segmentectomy.

The aim of this study is to review the clinical features, microbiologic etiologies, treatments, and outcomes of patients with splenic abscesses in recent 5 years. Methods: We reviewed admitted patients with suspected splenic abscess and made the diagnosis of splenic abscess. The clinical characteristics, underlying disease, treatment course, organism spectra, abscess number and size, therapeutic methods, and clinical outcome at a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan over a period of 5 years (from Jan 2012 to Dec 2016) were analyzed. Results: Of 16 patients with splenic abscess, male to female ratio was 1:1, with a mean age of 49.9 years (range 1 day to 52 years). Common presentation were fever (11 patients, 68.7%), diffuse abdominal pain (6 patients, 37.5%), left upper quadrant pain or tenderness (6 patients, 37.5%), splenomegaly (4 patients, 25%), and Left-sited pleural effusions (8 patients, 50%). Leukocytosis was noted in (15patients, 93.7%). Antimicrobial therapy was administered in all patients. Fourteen (87.5%) patients recovered under medical treatment. One (6.2%) patient underwent splenectomy, and four (25%) patients performed percutaneous drainage of their splenic abscess and 11 (68.7%) patients received antimicrobial therapy alone. Conclusion: We noted mortality may be more related to patients with underlying immunodeficiency. There was a relatively high proportion in patients with splenic abscesses receiving antimicrobial therapy alone and got a good prognosis especially in patients with small and multiple abscesses. Background: Association between psoriasis and leptospirosis has been previously mentioned but seldom cases were reported. We described a case at below. Methods: A 66-year-old woman with history of hypertension under medical control and psoriasis, was admitted to Tzu Chi General Hospital for itching erythmatous plaques over whole body and four extrimities for 3 months. She has been diagnosed with psoriasis for fifteen years and flared up intermittently. She previously worked at breakfast stand, and engaged in farming when she was young. Upon admission, she had multiple psoriatic lesions over her trunk and extremities. Stiff neck and arthritis of finger and toe joints were also noted. Results: Ten years ago, she came to our hospital for controlling her psoriasis condition. Phototherapy, acitretin, calcipotriol, and methotrexate were prescribed by dermatologist. Skin biopsy was done and showed superficial perivascular lymphocyte infiltration with elongated rete ridges, which was consistent with psoriasis. Urine PCR comfirmed Leptospire infection. Penicillin G and rifampicin was added. Her skin lesion was dramatically controlled in a week. The patient was discharged home with oral penicillin G and rifampin. In this time of her admission, antibiotics for leptospirosis were changed to ceftriaxone and fosfomycin due to unavailable of penicillin G. Skin biopsy ten years ago was also taken out for immunochemical staining of leptospira which revealed positive (Figure) .",

To reveal the characteristics of bacteremic pneumonia caused by ESBL-producing organisms is extremely important for clinicians, yet few studies have effectively achieved. The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between sputum isolation of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and outcomes of bacteremic pneumonia. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 83 patients of bacteremic pneumonia caused by E. coli and K. pneumonia (including of 38 ESBL-producing) objectively between January 2015 and December 2016 in Nagasaki Medical Center. Bacteremic pneumonia was defined as cases in which E. coli and K. pneumoniae were isolated from sputum culture and clinically suspected because of respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum and dyspnea, elevated inflammatory response of the laboratory data and chest abnormal shadow. Clinical information and outcome of adults with bacteremic pneumonia caused by ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae were analyzed. Results: A total of 83 patients with bacteremic pneumonia (including of 38 ESBL-producing) caused by E. coli (45 patients, 54.9%) and K. pneumoniae (37 patients, 45.1%) were identified, and classified 72.5% as hospital-acquired pneumonia, 14.5% as healthcare-associated pneumonia, and 13.0% as community-acquired pneumonia. Their mean age of ESBL and non-ESBL were 75.5 years and 76.4 years, and male patients of it were 73.7% and 77.8% respectively. The disclosed risk factors of sputum isolation of ESBLproducing E. coli and K. pneumonia are as follows; low BMI (P = 0.0195), antibiotic use history (P = 0.0495), ESBL isolation history (P = 0.0004), high Charlson Comorbidity Index (P = 0.0262), and high quick SOFA (P = 0.0376). About the impact of sputum isolation of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae on clinical course, inappropriate empirical therapy was initiated more often (62.1% vs15%, P = 0.0001), and associated with 60-day mortality (37.9% vs7.5%, P = 0.0026) Conclusion: ESBL-producing bacteremic pneumonia was associated with comorbidities and severity of the disease. Appropriate empirical therapy could lead to the improvement of prognosis.",

He reported no dyspnea, no abdominal pain, no recent traveling history, nor similar symptoms among his family or friends. Due to persistent symptoms, he was brought to emergency room of another hospital. On examination, hypotension of 72/50 mmHg was noted, and laboratory examination reported bandemia of 34%, C-reactive protein of 20 mg/dL, and troponin-I of 2.12 ng/mL. He was immediately transferred to our hospital. At Emergency Department, he was afebrile, tachycardia of 104 beats/ min, and hypotension of 76/45 mmHg. Physical examination reported no prominent findings except a 1 cm knife cut wound on his left hand, which happened at work 2 weeks ago. ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm.

Hydrocortisone and colchicine were prescribed for myocarditis. The patient improved dramatically in following days. Blood cultures were sterile and there was no evidence of active viral infection. He was discharged 1 week after admission uneventfully. One month after initial presentation, microscopic agglutination test for leptospirosis revealed significant rise comparing paired sera. Leptospira santarosai serovar shermani was positive at a titer of 1:400, which confirmed leptospirosis.

NTM pulmonary disease was confirmed by a second expectorated sputum samples. Ethambutol and clarithromycin were prescribed to treat possible M avium complex (MAC), which is the most common NTM infection in HIV/AIDS. Rifabutin and levofloxacin were added on hospital day 8. Clarithromycin was shifted to azithromycin because of intolerance. Further study of the sputum culture confirmed MABC by an official mycobacterium laboratory. Progressive lower limb pain, blurred vision and difficult speaking were noted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no mass effect, and PML was suspected. The patient was discharged after 9 weeks of hospital stay. His HIV viral loads were lower than 20 copies/uL within 4 months. Seizure happened once per month and follow-up MRI showed aggravating PML.

Campylobacter Jejuni, human immunodeficiency virus(HIV), Zika virus are the wellknown common specimen of the antecedent infection. However, there are no report about the Klebsiella pneumoniae primary liver abscess could also lead to GBS. Case report: A 75-year-old retired male patient had undeylying disease of Type II diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, stage V. He just discharged 2 weeks ago due to biliary tract infection with bacteremia which is proven of K. pneumoniae infection. He was admitted because of fever with chills for few hours. Abdominal echo was arranged and showed bile duct dilatation. Abdominal MRI revealed lobulated lesion at the S2 liver, with restricted diffusion which favor liver abscess. Flomocef 2g every 8 hours was prescribed for the impression of liver abscess. Blood culture during this admission showed no growth. However, bilateral lower leg muscle power and deep tendon reflex (DTR) decreased quickly from distal to proximal, progression of difficulty in defecation and urination during the hospilitation. Cerebrospinal fluid study showed albumino-cytological dissociation and electromyogram (EMG) indicate sensorimotor polyneuropathy of axon degeneration which indirect prove our impression with GBS. Intravenous immunoglubumin was injected. He finally discharged since the symptoms did not progress anymore. Three month later, He could walk and defecate normally when he came back to out patient department follow up. Discussion: Bilateral leg weakness with DTR decreased spreading up from distal to proximal, EMG indicated sensorimotor polyneuropathy of axonal degeneration and albumino-cytological dissociation truly correspond to GBS in this patient. Besides, he did not have other typical symptoms that present with C.Jejuni, HIV or zika virus. Thus, we could boldly associate his GBS with K.pneumoniae liver abscess. This is the first reported case of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in Taiwan associated with K.pneumoniae liver abscess which should be kept in mind when making a diagnosis of acute onset of bilateral leg weakness. Methods: After admission, intermittent high fever was persisted, and lab data showed leukocytosis and persisted elevated CRP level. However, there was no respiratory or urinary symptoms. Lab data showed PCT level in reference level. During 5/7\u223c5/13, chemotherapy was done on 5/8 and there was no major complications noted. However, watery diarrhea was noted since 5/8 night, and CRP level elevated to 45.28 mg/L. Furthermore, stool examination showed positive toxin A + B, which suspected Clostridium difficile infection. We prescribed Flagyl 2# Q6H since 5/10 for him. We also prescribed Trancolon and Smecta for symptom relieving. We had collected rectal swab culture for Clostridium difficile identification and we had ordered to keep contact isolation. Results: During 5/14-5/20, intermittent fever up to more than 39\u00b0C was still noted. Intermittent diarrhea was still noted and we kept oral Flagyl use. Furthermore, severe electrolyte imbalance persisted during this week, with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and frequently electrolyte supplement was needed, especially hypokalemia. The watery diarrhea was improving to semi-fluid-solid like stool, with decreasing frequency. We therefore discontinue contact isolation since 5/19. Conclusion: Clostridium difficile is a kind of normal bacteria in human intestinal tract, the use of antibiotics will lead to other intestinal bacteria to reduce the normal therefore cause a lot of breeding and cause disease and severe electrolyte imbalance. Cancer patients, elderly, Immune function deficiency, long-term hospitalization and the use of antibiotic treatment are more susceptible to infection. Clostridium difficile infection is through the hand and body surface contact. Hand washing for the patient has chemotherapy and medical team to prevent Clostridium difficile is particularly important.",

The protocol was initially evaluated and improved with known selective positive BC samples. We then studied in parallel the performance of the protocol and the colony MS identifications in positive clinical BC samples. All discrepancies were investigated by \"gold standard\" of gene sequencing. Results: Of the 54 spiked BC samples, the IH method showed comparable results with Sepsityper\u2122 after applying the modified cut-off values. Accurate species, genus level identification was achieved in 88.7%, 3.9% of all the clinical monomicrobial BCs (284/ 301, 94.4%). It showed superior performance for Gram negative bacteria than for Gram positive bacteria (92.8% versus 82.4%). For anaerobes and yeasts, 80.0% and 90.0% accuracy in species identification were achieved, respectively. For polymicrobial mixed cultures (17/301, 5.6%), MALDI-TOF MS correctly reported a single species present in all the polymicrobial BCs under the Standard mode, while using the MIXED Method, two species were correctly identified in 52.9% of the samples. Comparison between different bottle types, the results indicated that the BACTEC\u2122 Lytic/ 10 Anaerobic/F culture vials exhibited the best performance among the three (BACTECTM Plus Aerobic/F: 87.4%; BACTECTM Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F: 92.1%; BACTECTM Myco/F Lytic: 80.0%).",

Mycobacterial culture is considered as the best reference standard but is relatively complex and slow. Thus, Taiwan CDC recommends to develop rapid technique. Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid) assay has been introduced for the diagnosis of TB and RIF(rifampicin)-resistance. We herein compare its diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary tuberculosis with smear microscopy and assess the assay for rifampicin resistance in adults. Methods: It's a diagnostic question, Acquiring systematic review (SR) of cross-sectional studies with reference standard and blinding is priority. P-pulmonary tuberculosis; I-Xpert MTB/RIF; C-smear microscopy; O-diagnostic accuracy The PICO terms and their respective synonyms were engaged by boolean character \"AND\"\u2192 to search CochraneLibrary and Pubmed\u2192 3 SR were filterd out of 6 searching results in Cochrane Library\u2192 One most relevant SR was selected and in PubMed we included the same SR. Results: As an initial test replacing smear microscopy, Xpert \u00ae MTB/ RIF pooled sensitivity 89%; pooled specificity 99%. As an add-on test following a negative smear microscopy result, Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity 67%; pooled specificity 99%. For smear-positive, culture-positive TB, Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity 98%. Compared with smear microscopy, Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF increased TB detection among culture-confirmed cases by 23%. For RIF-resistance detection, Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity 95% and pooled specificity 98%. Conclusion: Compared with smear microscopy, Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF substantially increases TB detection among culture-confirmed cases. Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF has higher sensitivity for TB detection in smear-positive than smear-negative patients in adults. Nonetheless, this test may be valuable as an add-on test following smear microscopy in patients previously found to be smearnegative. For rifampicin resistance detection, Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF provides accurate results and can allow rapid initiation of MDR-TB treatment (Level 1).",

The following information was collected: age, gender, underlying disease, presence and type of central venous catheters, parenteral nutrition, use of corticosteroids and exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Results: 25 cultures of blood samples obtained from 12 patients grew Rhodotorula species, mainly Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. The median age was 66 years. Female patients were predominant. Central venous catheters presents in 9 patients, including 4 patients having Hickman catheters. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered in 9 patients. Only 2 patients received antifungal therapy. 30-day mortality was 33%. Conclusion: The most common predisposing factors were presence of central venous catheter and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Results: 13 cases were collected from May 2006 to April 2017 in a single tertiary teaching hospital. All of them were men aging from 17 to 54 years old. 11 were MSM and most common acute syndrome included fever and skin rashes. 6 were co-infected with syphilis. All HIV Ag/Ab EIA /ELISA showed positive and HIV RNA viral load ranged from 3.41 to more than 7 log 10 copy/mL. 7 had CD4 counts less than 200/uL. At the same time, 5 of 13 showed negative Western Blot and the other 8 showed indeterminate results. Repeat Western Blot was done in 6 of 13 and all revealed positive results finally, with time interval from 3 to 17 months. Conclusion: Although indeterminate Western Blot may be present in acute and early HIV infections, confirmation of HIV infection still need more information such as HIV RNA viral loads, PCR or seroconversion. For most clinicians, negative Western Blot usually excludes HIV/AIDS, and may ignore the fact of window period present in acute HIV infections. In high risk population, the diagnosis of acute and early HIV infections can be made by obtaining exposure history or a presentation of a STD.",

It disrupts normal gut flora resulting in diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, or megacolon, etc. The difficulty of diagnosis and the strain diversity make early treatment and isolation a challenge. Bacterial culture and identification are time-consuming and cannot to be used for confirming the virulent strains. By introducing inspection equipment actively and setting the molecular analysis mechanism of toxin-producing strain detection, toxin carriers receive timely treatment and infection control is implemented. Methods: Gene Xpert Dx system was used to detect the toxin genes of Clostridium difficile and NAP/O27 strains which is highly pathogenic. We set an alert mechanism in our hospital information system. It provides not only the daily list of the inpatients meeting the inclusion criteria, such as the times of diarrhea more than or equal to five time or the weight of watery diarrhea is more than or equal to 500 g a day, but also advice items and codes automatically. Results: Among 155 samples, 27 were positive for toxins (17.4%) and no NAP/O27 strains were detected. The laboratory sent information to the physicians and the infection control department immediately when positive outcome released. Also, medical information system and nurse information system revealed alert signal for isolation reminding. Conclusion: Patients suspected infected with Clostridium difficile can be diagnosed and treated by rapid molecular biology analysis. At the same time, contact precaution, antibiotic evaluation, and environmental cleaning rules establishment are carried out to control nosocomial Clostridium difficile infection and improve medical care quality.",

Investigation of 4 drug-resistant bacteria with clinical significance to healthcare-associated infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycinresistant Enterococcus (VRE), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and carbapenem-resistant Enterobactoriaceae (CRE). 2. By using the Whonet system and working with our IT (Information Technology) department, a statistical report format was constructed. We could analyze the isolation rates and trend of drug-resistant pattern of the above bacteria from January, 2015 to February, 2017. 3. The analyzed results were reported and tracked in group meetings regularly held by our infection control committee to provide timely and effective clinical information to our infection control practitioners and physicians. Results: The isolation rates of 4 multi-drug resistant bacteria are as follows respectively: MRSA, between 27.7% and 55.3% (means: 47.4%); CRAB, reduced from 71.8% to 33.3% (means: 44.0%). Both the annual isolation rates of MRSA and CRAB declined significantly. The isolation rates of CRE dropped from 5.4% to 3.3% (means: 4.0%), with flat trend. However, VRE increased from 1.9% to 23.9% (means: 13.0%), which showed an upward trend. Conclusion: The trend analysis of MRSA, CRAB and CRE indicated successful infection control. However, the increased isolation rate of VRE highlighted the need to reinforce further monitoring of VRE infection, which is the key point of infection control in our hospital. Epidemiological analysis of multi-drug resistant pathogens could assist clinicians in choosing the appropriate antibiotics. By this analysis, a decrease of multi-drug resistant microorganisms, improved patient survival, a better quality of care, as well as the reduction of medical expense would all be expected.",

Results: The most commonly identified bacteria was Staphylococcus aureus (164 participants, 33.6%). Of the 164 cases, 60.0% (98 cases) were Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The MRSA in 1 case was resistant to Vancomycin and 97 cases were susceptible. Seven cases were resistant to Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and 91 cases were susceptible. MRSA had the highest sensitivity to TMP-SMX except Vancomycin. The second most frequently identified bacteria was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (109 patients, 22.3%). Of these 109 cases, 54.1% (59 cases) were Ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA). CRPA were highly susceptible to Ceftazidime, Amikacin, and Meropenem. In 28.1% of patients (137 cases), the remaining bacteria were detected except for the two bacteria. No growth was found in 16% of patients, which may be due to antibiotic use before arriving at the tertiary hospital. Conclusion: MRSA was the most susceptible to TMP-SMX among oral medicine. Therefore, TMP-SMX may be a preferential treatment for MRSA in outpatient settings. CRPA showed the lowest resistance to Ceftazidime. Because no suitable oral antibiotic exists for CRPA, inpatient treatment should be considered in these cases. Background: Previous studies have suggested that sequence type 59 (ST59) predominates among borderline-oxacillin resistant mecA-positive Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) (minimum inhibitory concentrations of oxacillin, 0.5-4 \u03bcg/mL) isolates, and clinical data related to bacteremia caused by BORSA ST45 isolates are limited. Methods: Patients (age >15 years) with bacteremia due to BORSA who were admitted to the emergency department in a tertiary hospital between January 2001 and December 2015 were evaluated. Clinical characteristics of patients with bacteremia caused by BORSA, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and MRSA bacteremia were compared. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined using the agar dilution method. Genetic characteristics of all BORSA isolates were analyzed using typing of the SCCmec gene and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to identify the clonality of the emerging ST type isolates. The promoter region sequence and quinolone-resistant genes were also analyzed for all BORSA isolates and the major ciprofloxacin resistant clone, respectively. Results: Among the 65 patients with bacteremia due to BORSA, the in-hospital mortality was 24.6%, significantly lower than that of bacteremic patients caused by MRSA (38.5%, P = 0.03). The underlying conditions were similar between BORSA and MRSA patients, but with less dialysis of the former (P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that septic shock (odds ratio, 15.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-180.89) and bacteremia originating from lower respiratory tract infection (OR, 5.78; 95% CI, 1.10-30.28) were two independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Multidrug resistant ST45 with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance (MICs range, 8-128 \u03bcg/mL) replaced ST59 as the predominant clone since 2012. No major clustering of ST45 isolates was detected. Conclusion: Clinical presentations and underlying condition of BORSA and MRSA bacteremia patients were similar, with lower inhospital mortality. The emerging multidrug resistant ST45 clone has replaced ST59 as the most common in BORSA isolates.",

Background: Cellulitis is usually caused by indigenous flora colonzing on the skin and appendages, such as Staphylococcus or streptococcus. However, in absence of abscess or open wound, it is difficult to establish the bacterial etiology. We usually prescribe antibiotics basing on local epidemiologic data. In recent few years, community-acquired MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) increases gradually in Taiwan, whether antibiotics against MRSA and MSSA (methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus) should be prescribed at the same time become a clinical dilemma.",

All isolates from 2014 and the isolates published in Low et al. (2017) were the first isolate per patient. In addition, in this study, the clonal complex of related isolates was defined by eBURST based on the assigned sequence types for 2014 isolates in this study and the sequence types for 2013 isolates in previous study (Low et al., 2017) . Results: NDM was the most common carbapenemase gene detected among the 2014 isolates and majority of the NDM producing isolates were co-producing other carbapenemase. Loss of porin was detected in 5 isolates from 2014. Compared to the previous study, the number of NDM in this hospital was significantly increased from only 1 isolate in 2013 to 12 isolates in 2014. Overall, increasing numbers of carbapenemase coproducing isolates over the 2-year period had been observed. In addition, 9 sequence types with 3 new sequence types (ST2198, ST 2199, ST2200) were identified among 2014 isolates. Similar to previous findings on 2013 isolates, ST101 was predominant in 2014, followed by ST147 and ST11. Finally, based on the eBURST analysis, the isolates from 2014 have been grouped into two clonal complexes while all 8 sequence types of 2013 isolates appeared to be singleton. Conclusion: High heterogeneity among the isolated CRKp were observed. The increasing cases of CRKp in this hospital might be due to the emergence of CRKp harboring various carbapenemases coupled with the loss of porin.",

Once this acid interacted to the pathogen, it will destroy the structure of pathogen then the osmolality will change. Finally, the pathogen will die. So, in this study, we wanted to know the really effect of HOCl killed pathogen in vitro. Methods: In this study, we used the Acinetobacter baumannii as a pathogen. In the begging, we transferred Acinetobacter baumannii to normal saline, then check the MacFaland to 0.5. We used this suspension and add HOCl, then we used the TSA agar to culture. According to previous studies, these bacteria can live in the surface of hospital over 3 months, and once the staff touch the surface, it would be a chance to infect patient by any actions. That is to say, it's very easy infected by CRAB with imperfect infection control. In this report, we found some error in our hospital that occurred on the action of bronchoscopy operated. Methods: In this Investigation, we collected the five strain CRAB from 5 patients' BAL culture. Then we check all the action of staff who operated the bronchoscopy. Then we used the Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis to check the strain were the same or not. Results: After the investigation, we found the staff did not use the disposable gel for bronchoscopy. It wound be another risking for infection. Otherwise, we found the staff didn't wash their hand correctly. But, thanks to the PFGE, the result showed all the CRAB were not the same. That's to say, these CRABs could live in the surface, and not only one train were presented on this ICU. Conclusion: In this case, even the CRAB were not the same, but we still found the possible chance that would cause infection once the staff don't take care. Besides that, we suggested that it's better to use the disposable gel for Bronchoscopy. Table 1 .",

In 2015 they suddenly raised, yet through infection control interventions, CRAB decreased in 2016 again (the results were listed in Figure 1 ). Conclusion: CRAB showed the highest percentage of antibiotic resistance MDRO in our hospital. In addition to promotion of Antibiotic Stewardship Program, more attention should be paid to MDRO monitoring. Our monitor data were counted and the results were reported in the infection control meeting quarterly. Therefore we were able to find pre-described the trend of raised CRAB in 2015, and immediately took interventions, including contact precautions, arranging areas to place and treat MDRO patients.

There is no significant variation (75.9% vs 74.1% P = 0.320) between hand hygiene compliance rate in the first part of hand hygiene observation and the observation performed by ICN in previous quarter before the study. The overall hand hygiene compliance rates had been significantly improved from 75.9% to 80.3% (P = 0.007) in all staff groups. All of the 20 ICLNs had completed the evaluation questionnaires. Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a common legal infectious disease in Taiwan. The lesions of Tuberculosis are sometimes non-classical, leading to difficulties in making clinical diagnosis. Thus, Tuberculosis easily causes nosocomial infection and the reason behind is worth exploring. The diagnosis of Tuberculosis mainly depends on chest X-ray, TB/AFB, and TB/culture so that the patients can be diagnosed and receive treatments in time. In July 2016, another hospital notified us that one of our patients had Tuberculosis. In June 2016, this patient was admitted to our hospital for 8 days. We found 3 contacts after estimating the communicable period, which was 3 months before the patient was diagnosed. The patient neither presented with classical symptoms of Tuberculosis nor received any chest x-ray inspection. As a result, we wanted to analyze the reasons and make improvements. Methods: We used Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and implemented interventions including: (1) to add inpatient's chest X-ray inspection into routine standardized operating procedures and announce it in infection control committees and visiting staff meetings, (2) to provide in-service education, and (3) to follow up the contacts' chest X-ray inspections regularly. Results: After the interventions, chest X-ray inspection is now one of the routine admission inspections for inpatients. Also, there are two regular courses relating to Tuberculosis each year and the course completion rate of all health care professionals was 95.5%. Conclusion: Some patients with Tuberculosis may spread mycobacterium tuberculosis in hospitals before their diagnosis is confirmed, thus, increasing the risk of exposure to infections for staffs and patients. It is necessary to make convincing diagnosis in time and implement infection control interventions. All in all, we provided our caring experiences as a reference for medical and nursing management.",

All isolates were sent to a reference laboratory for typing and confirmed that the environmental samples were the same strain as the 2 patients who isolated VRE on the first occasion. Conclusions: Although VRE is known to persist in the environment, we were concerned that VRE persisted despite cleaning of the ICU. Further investigation revealed that ward cleaner is responsible for cleaning the bed and that nursing staff are responsible for cleaning the medical instruments. But as the cot sides of a bed may be moved, it was unclear whose role it was to clean the cot sides. Transmission to patients is however more likely to occur in \"near-patient\" areas such as the hospital bed and patient equipment. While cleaning of soiled linens room and floors is usually done by the ward cleaner, which cleans these \"nearpatient\" areas is greyer and may be carried out by nursing staff, ward cleaner or healthcare assistants; depending on the nature of equipment to be cleaned.

Implementations of infection control measures were applied in order to control the outbreak. Methods: Environmental and laboratory investigation: We started our study by interviewing healthcare workers who worked in Maternity Nursery, five neonates presented with pustules during 10 days admission. We found that workers did not change protective clothes; medical files were located at patient's room, workers failed to clean their hands, repeated use baby towel, clean stuff located at patient's room. Environmental samples, 59 specimens, from the most frequently used neonatal care equipments, such as radiant warmer, weight scale, baby incubator, nursing ward and keyboards were collected for bacterial culture. Nasal swab samples (98) Background: An accurate diagnosis of bloodstream infection relies on the result of blood culture, especially in the emergency room (ER), where emerging or critical patients were taken care of and relied heavily on rapid and correct blood culture results. In the case hospital, the contamination rate of blood culture constantly remained as high as 7.6% (CLSI <3%), which would influence a physician in making correct diagnosis and choosing suitable antimicrobial agents. Therefore, how to reduce the contamination rate of blood culture becomes a critical issue.",

Background: Hand hygiene is the leading measure for preventing the spread of antimicrobial resistance and reducing healthcareassociated infections. However healthcare worker compliance with optimal practices remains low in most settings. We evaluated the impact of multifaceted hand hygiene (HH) intervention on the adherence of HH and isolation rate of antibiotic resistant organisms. Methods: Multifaceted HH intervention was conducted between 2011 and 2016, and the isolation of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was compared with conventional intervention period (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) . The intervention consists of multidisciplinary HH campaign, encouragement of the 5 moments for HH, monitoring of the consumption of HH products and feedback using reported benchmark, and direct observation of HH practices in MRSA high risk wards. Antimicrobial use density and antimicrobial heterogeneity index were also evaluated (antibiotic class evaluated: tazobactam/piperacillin, carabapenems, 4 th generation cephalosporins/ceftazidime, and fluoroquinolone). Results: Participation rates in HH campaign increased from 48.7% to 90.4% ( p < 0.001). Number of HH episodes per patients day calculated by the consumption of alcohol hand rub increased from 5.6 \u00b1 5.5 to 8.5 \u00b1 10.3 ( p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in the isolation rate of hospital onset MRSA between the 2 intervention period (1.07 and 0.74/1,000 patient days, p < 0.001). Isolation rate of P. aeruginosa which reveal resistance to 2 or more classes of antibiotics was also significantly decreased (0.163 and 0.134/1,000 patient days, p = 0.004). In addition to direct HH observation, relocation to a new ward had a beneficial effect in the MRSA high risk wards. Rate of antimicrobial use density in carbapenems decreased from 36.4% to 25.1%, and antimicrobial heterogeneity index improved from 0.82 to 0.85. Conclusion: Paralleled introduction of multifaceted HH intervention and other strategies such as appropriate use of antimicrobials had a significant impact on the isolation of antimicrobial resistant organisms.",

This study aims to explore the profile, recognized pathogens and predicted prognostic factors for mortality of bloodstream infections. Methods: The retrospective study was performed in a medical center from 2010 to 2015. Epidemiologic investigations were conducted. Patients with temporary hemodialysis catheters and reported as BSIs were inclueded except individuals under the age of 20. The chi-square test was used for categorical variables, the Mann-Whitney U test was used for data that had nonnormal distribution, and the logistic regression analysis was used for assessing predicted prognostic factors for mortality. Results: A total of 309 patients with BSIs were included in the study period. These patients were predominantly male (66.2%), and had a mean age of 72 \u00b1 16 years. The median of length of stay were 24 days. The most common isolated organism were Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The most common isolated antimicrobial-resistant pathogens were methicillin-resistant Coagulase-negative staphylococcus (75%), Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (64.6%) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (63.1%). The crude rates of in-hospital mortality rate was 55.1%, and the 30day mortality rate was 78.3% in all deaths. The logistic regression analysis identified shock (odds ratio [OR], 14.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], bedridden (OR, 2.3; CI, ), using of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH, OR, 15.8; CI, antibiotics (OR, 2.5; CI, , and mechanism ventilator (OR, 2.2; CI, 1.04-4.61) as independent predictors for mortality.

(2) Background: Many critically ill patients can survive by use of mechanical ventilation. However, these patients have serious clinical condition, and are immune-compromised status, many health care associated infections like ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) will be the major complication. VAP is defined as pneumonia after 48 hours use of ventilator mainly due to bacterial infection. According to the US nosocomial infection surveillance system data, the incidence of VAP is 5-16\u2030 which is also an important indicator of quality control in a critical care unit. The incidence of VAP is related to length of hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation. The incidence will be increased by 1% in every one day of hospital stay, peak incidence occurred on the seventh day, average 5-10 days of ventilator use. Thus, if ventilator is used for longer duration, there is increase in patient' hospital stay and mortality. In our hospital, incidence VAP in intensive care unit is 0.69-1.72\u2030 from 2014 to 2016 which is expected to achieve zero tolerance in coming year. However, there are many new health care personnel in these year, multiple health care measures are not fulfilled for our target. In 2017, Central Disease Control department implements the program of bundle care for invasive health care procedure. Fortunately, we can participate in this program, and strengthen to prevent VAP with application of bundle care. Methods: We have applied the health care personnel training for basic knowledge of bundle care. Since February 2017, we implement VAP bundle care which include (1) elevate the head of bed for 30-45\u00b0, (2) oral cleansing by using tooth cleaning sponge, small tooth brush, and chlorhexidine contained mouthwash, (3) setting of cleaning and sterilization of steam inhalation therapy equipment and changing the tubing regularly, (4) addition of setting bottle to facilitate the removal of fluid inside the ventilator circuits under avoiding contamination of environment. These standard infection control measures are added to intensive care unit manual and keep health care personnel to follow.",

It started to implement care bundle for VAP prevention from June, 2015. To realize the effectiveness, we analyze the densities of infection and the use rates of ventilators during the two periods of pre-intervention (Nov. 2013 -May 2015 and postintervention (Jun. 2015 -Dec. 2016 . The result can be as a reference to continuously improve the quality of medical care. Methods: After infection control practitioners collected cases based on surveillance definition of VAP formulated by CDC, the cases have to be reconfirmed by the minister of Critical Care Medicine. Following the interventions proposed by CDC and JCT, 5 items were lifting the head of bed 30-45\u00b0higher, ceasing sedative daily, daily evaluation of extubation, draining the water in ventilators to empty, and performing oral nursing care with mouthwash containing 0.12-0.2% chlorhexidine at least 2 times per day and then keeping records in the check list. Results: Statistics show the densities of infection during the periods of pre-intervention and post-intervention respectively were 1.38\u2030 (6/4350) and 1.71\u2030 (8/4666). The use rates of ventilators were 51.08% and 54.29%. Conclusion: The density of infection increased by 0.33\u2030 in 19 months of post-intervention stage. The value of Chi-squared Test was p > 0.05 (=0.686). The use rate of ventilator increased by 3.21%. The rate (54.29%) was higher than the rate (51.2%) in the equivalent ICU which identified by TNIS, Taiwan. By further analyzing the cases, it can be found no more than 3 cases per season and they individually occurred in every different month. Zero infection maintained in the latest season shows that if daily evaluation of extubation can be put into effect, it is definitely able to improve the quality of medical care.",

The program designer set up an online catheter removal assessment tool, real-time query system, and mobile APP program. The mobile APP program includes a placement check and a daily care evaluation. Results: During the study period, 913 patients had urinary catheter, with a total of 3920 days of the catheter indwelling. After the program has been set up, catheter placement check was done for 168 patients during catheter insertion, the compliance rate of utilizing the program was 100%; and a total of 2833 staff preformed urine catheter daily assessment using the program, the compliance rate increased from 29.4% to 60%. The average length of catheter indwelling decreased from 4.40 days to 3.94 days. Catheter utilization rate decreased from 25.34% to 21.63%. Catheter-related urinary tract infection density decreased from 2.76 \u2030 to 1.19 \u2030. And the satisfaction rate after informatization is 100%. Conclusion: When the system was first implanted, the initial compliance rate was only 29.4%. The reason was that physicians did not complete the daily assessment of catheter removal in the program. By adding an evaluation path and a reminder window to the physician's ordering system, the compliance rate increased to 60%. Through combining the implantation of informatization, online real-time inquire system, mobile devices and user-centered program design to achieve the purpose of simplifying the process, increasing the efficiency of data processing and integrating, and enhancing compliance. As a result, significantly improved the compliance rate of care bundle and user satisfaction, reduce the use of catheter, the length of indwelling and infection density.",

However, nebulizers are potential sources of microbial contamination of the respiratory tract. Small-volume nebulizers medications for administering bronchodilators, including hand-held nebulizers, can produce bacterial aerosols. Ultrasonic hand-held nebulizers have been associated with nosocomial pneumonia Methods: In order to understand the suitability and influence of the ultrasonic nebulizers used in treatment of respiratory diseases of paediatric patients, we conducted a systematic literature review of the articles published before April 2017. Keywords in both Chinese and English were entered into the search engine which comprised of 5 medical database. We then selected 5 articles which match our standard for further review. Results: After 24 hours of usage, the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) can be isolated from ultrasonic nebulizers. Bcc isolates were obtained from nebulizer draining tubes, operating water chambers, oscillator and nebulizer solutions. The Evidence-based medicine literature suggests that appropriate maintenance of ultrasonic nebulizers is crucial for preventing Bcc contamination of nebulizers and subsequent respiratory tract and blood infections.

Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common healthcare-associated infection in intensive care units, which can cause patients to have severe morbidity and mortality. In Jan. 2013, we executed the ventilator care bundle (VCB) to reduce VAP in our hospital, including daily assessment of readiness to extubation, daily sedation vacation, elevation of patient's head of bed to 30-45\u00b0, using 0.12% chlorhexidine for oral care, and exhausting water in ventilator circuit every two hours. In 2015, the VAP incidence reduced to 2.45\u2030 in our surgical intensive care unit (SICU), but it still higher than those in the SICUs of other teaching hospitals (1.26\u2030). In order to further reduce VAP incidence in our SICU, we used quality control circle to reinforce the efficacy of VCB. Methods: Our hospital is a 960-bed regional teaching hospital with a 16-bed SICU. We used quality control circle to find 3 disadvantages in our VCB program, including poor cognition of VCB in SICU members, a lack of internal auditing to carry through VCB, misarrangement of suction tubes and aerosol therapy apparatus, and inaccurate angle of elevation of bed head. So, we executed an improvement plan, including regular training programs for VCB in SICU, development of the auditing system, adequate storage of suction tubes and aerosol therapy apparatus, and adding angle scale on bedside.",

Background: Since New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) was first detected, several variants have been further identified that differ by one or two amino acid substitutions. In 2014, a novel NDM-9 metallo-\u03b2-lactamase was first identified from a sequence type 107 (ST107) Klebsiella pneumoniae strain. Like the other NDM variants, NDM-9 confers high levels of resistance and compromises the effectiveness of most antibiotics, including carbapenems. Although polymyxin B and colistin ( polymyxin E) offer limited treatment options for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms carrying NDM-9, the emergence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-1 (for mobilised colistin resistance gene) conferring resistance to colistin ( polymyxin E) may attenuate the utility of colistin. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the clinical isolate was tested by the agar dilution method. Genetic backgrounds were detected including multilocus sequence typing (MLST), drug resistant gene by PCR and sequencing. Results: The 79-year-old female patient had a history of colon cancer and chronic kidney disease and had undergone a radical left hemicolectomy 1 month prior to the current hospital admission. She was admitted to intensive care unit for peritonitis with septic shock. Her clinical condition and haemodynamic status gradually improved following antibiotic treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) for 7 days. The results of laboratory examinations were as follows: white blood cell count, 22,100/ mm 3 ; platelet count, 191,000/mm 3 ; creatinine, 4.89 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 10 IU/L; and C-reactive protein, 43.7 mg/L (reference value, <5 mg/L). Despite TZP being resumed for UTI complicated by sepsis syndrome, her clinical condition rapidly deteriorated and the patient's family requested supportive care. Finally, the patient died on the 11th day of hospitalization. Meanwhile, the urinary catheter specimen grew carbapenem-resistant E. coli. Molecular diagnosis was identified the E coli isolate carrying MCR-1 and NDM-9. Conclusion: The present case indicates the possibility of coproduction of MCR-1 and NDM-9 among clinical isolates and indicates the importance of surveillance of colistin-and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates and associated genes in humans, with special reference to MCR-1 and NDM-9.",

Methods: Thirteen high-risk units, including medical (n = 5), surgical (n = 3), cardiac intensive care units (n = 2), respiratory care centers (n = 2), and respiratory care ward (n = 1) were included in this quality-improvement project. The stud period was divided into the pre-intervention phase (between January 1, 2013 and July 31, 2013) and post-intervention phase (between August 1, 2013 and October 31, 2013). Results: The incidence of CA-UTI decreased from 3.86 to 2.98 per 1,000 catheter-days (95% CI, 0.65-0.82; p < 0.0001) before and after the introduction of the CA-UTI bundle. Among 66 episodes of culture-proven CA-UTIs, Candida spp. were the most common pathogens (n = 17, 25.8%). For the seven elements of the insertion bundle, the compliance was the lowest for cleaning of the perineum, followed by hand hygiene. The overall compliance rates of the insertion bundle were 93.4%, 99.5%, and 96.3% in medical centers, regional hospitals, and district hospital, respectively. For the six elements of the maintenance bundle, the compliance was the lowest for daily review of the need of a Foley catheter. The overall compliance rates of the maintenance bundle were 95.7%, 99.9%, and 99.9% in medical centers, regional hospitals, and district hospital, respectively. Conclusion: The implementation of CA-UTI bundle care reduced CA-UTI. A process surveillance checklist can be helpful for understanding which parts of the bundle care require improvements.",

Background: This study assessed the in vitro antibacterial activity of combinations of amikacin and doxycycline or tigecycline against multidrug-resistant E. coli isolates. Methods: Twenty-four different pulsotypes, including 10 extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-, 10 carbapenem-resistant, 2 New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-and 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-E. coli isolates were collected. Combination effect was detected by two methods, including the checkerboard, time-killing. Results: All 24 isolates were susceptible to amikacin and tigecycline. Only 30% of ESBL and 50% of carbapenem-resistant E. coli were susceptible to doxycycline. Both of the NDM-E. coli had a MIC of 64 \u03bcg/ml. The checkerboard method showed that for the ESBL-and carbapenem-resistant E. coli, the synergistic effects of amikacin/doxycycline were 80% and 90%, respectively. For the two KPC-and two NDM-E. coli, the FIC index of amikacin/doxycycline were 0.5/0.375 and 0.5/0.281, respectively. For the ESBL-and carbapenem-resistant E. coli isolates, the combinations of amikacin and doxycycline exhibited synergistic activities against 80%, and 80% and 10% vs 60%, and 80% and 10% of the isolates at concentrations of 1x, 1/2x and 1/4xMIC, respectively. The synergistic effect seems to be similar for doxycycline and tigecycline based combinations with amikacin. Conclusion: The antibacterial activity of doxycycline can be enhanced by the addition of amikacin and is observed against most multidrug-resistant E. coli isolates.",

Patients receiving mechanically assisted ventilation have more risks for acquiring pneumonia compared with patients not receiving ventilatory support and the risk for acquiring pneumonia increased 1% per day. Prevention is better than cure. Therefore, caring for patients on mechanical ventilators is especially important. It's expected that implementation care bundles improved HCAIs rates and ensure high care quality. Methods: Care bundles including care of ventilator circuit, daily assessment of sedation, oral hygiene, head of the bed elevation to 30-45\u00b0, intermittent subglottic secretion drainage, and drain from ventilator circuit was implemented from January, 2015. The incidence of VAP was higher than other hospitals during initial implementation stage and the causes were lack of knowledge of care bundle strategies, low implementation rate, lack of unified mouthwash ingredients, lack of standards and auditing practice, low correction rate (50%) in care practice. For strengthening implementation of infection control measures, the changes in institutions, management, and human behavior were needed, hence the measures included education programs, evidence-based research, innovative approach, VAP guideline and audits through multidisciplinary team work. Results: Care quality improved. In addition, staff's knowledge about VAP increased from 70% to 100% and accuracy and implementation of care achieving 100% via audit. The analysis of control chart for monitoring rate of VAP indicated that the process was under control with dramatic improvement by comparison with other hospitals. The other benefits included higher rate of ventilator weaning and lowered infection rate. Conclusion: The use of teamwork builds safety culture and contributes to further promote compliance with care bundles. The changes in institute, management and staff's behavior not only improve quality of health care but also assure patient safety, and benefits of hospitals, health workers and government.",

Background: Most of the residents in the LTCFs were survivors from acute medical conditions and frequently harbored multi-drug resistant organisms resulting from their previous treatment course. Therefore, infection or colonization with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have become an important issue. This study planned to investigate the antimicrobial agent susceptibility of and the molecular typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the residents and environments in six long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Taiwan. Methods: We prospectively investigated the existence of MDROs, including MRSA, in residents of six LTCFs and their environments from January to December 2016. Active surveillance of colonization of MDROs was performed by culturing nasal and rectal swab samples every three months for the residents. If MSA was identified, then swab specimens from environmental sources were collected and cultured. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of common anti-microbial agents were tested. The SCCmec genotype and Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of selected MRSA isolates were further analyzed. Results: A total of 339 isolates of MRSA was identified during the study period. Among them, 135 isolates (39.8%) were identified from LTCF residents. Generally, the isolate numbers from LTCF residents in each surveillance culture correlated with the number of isolates from the environment. The predominant SCCmec genotypes were type IV and V. The predominant MLST types belonged to ST59 (42.3%, 60/152) and ST45 (19.7%, 28/142). The predominant MLST strains varied from facilities to facilities. However, the MLST typing from the environment cultures could correlate with the culture from the residents. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of 339 isolates of MRSA to various commonly used antibiotics were determined. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, nitrofurantoin, quinopristin-dalfoprestine, linezolid, mupirocin, and teicoplanin. Daptomycin (99.7%), rifampicin (97.9%), and fucidic acid (96.8%) also exerted excellent in vitro activities against these 339 isolates of MRSA. However, the MIC values of tetracycline, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin were significantly lower in ST59 as compared to ST45. Conclusion: The MRSA widely distributed in some but not all the long-term care facilities in Taiwan. No single clonal expansion was found in different facilities. However, the MLST typing of the environmental stains highly correlated with the colonized strains in LTCF residents. An individualized environmental cleansing policy should be adopted to facilitate the LTCF to reduce the environmental colonization with MRSA. Commonly used antimicrobial agents against hospital-acquired strain of MRSA remained highly active against these isolates from LTCFs.",

A serial of interventions were enforced including (1) use of pre-filled heparin syringe (2) reduction of non-essential use of artificial blood vessels (3) Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a frequent hospital acquired infections among intensive care unit patients. The goal of this study was to apply a bundle for ventilatorassociated pneumonia prevention as a process for quality improvement in a single surgical intensive care unit. Methods: It consisted of the implementation of an evidence-based ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention bundle adapted to surgical ICU and using the plan-do-study-act cycle as a strategy for quality improvement. The 7-element care bundle was implemented, including head-of-bed elevation 30\u00b0-45\u00b0, daily sedation vacation and assessment for extubation, peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis, oral care with chlorhexidine, and prevent tube condensate from entering the airways and maintenance of endotracheal tube cuff pressure at 20-30 mmHg. The bundle compliance and VAP rates were then followed. This study analyses the SICU utilization, ventilator utilization, and VAP incidence between January 2014 and June 2014 to assess the impact of VAP bundle in a clinical setting. Results: A total of 202 SICU patients were analyzed in this study. The mean age was older than control group (63.83 vs. 48.71 years old). The ventilator days were longer than control group (9 vs. 4.8 days). Compared with control group, the patients with VAP has higher incidence of underline with COPD(16.7 vs. 11.2%), higher rate of H2 blocker or PPI use (100% vs. 70%), higher rate of using inotropic agent immediately after ventilator support (33.3% and 18.4%), and higher rate of TPN use (66.7% vs. 13.3%). The mean interval between intubation and diagnosis of VAP was 14.3 days (1-56). The mean interval between intubation and mortality was 36.6 days (9-92). In response to VAP bundle interventions, no difference in SICU utilization ( p = 0.32) between the pre-VAP and post-VAP bundle phases was noted, whereas the ventilator utilization was decreased, from 359 ventilator days to 295 ventilator days ( p = 0.19) monthly; the VAP density had remarkably decreased from 1. 4 Background: There is a worldwide increase in the incidence of Carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (CPE). CPE contain plasmid-borne genetic materials that are capable of spreading rapidly between bacteria and between individuals, rendering Carbapenems, an important group of broad spectrum antibiotics useless. We detected a significant increase in CPE, including three outbreaks, in a 285-bed convalescence hospital in 2016. Although standard infection control measures like hand hygiene audit and regular environmental decontamination were in place, the CPE incidence increased and rose to 0.34/1,000-patient-bed-days in 2Q2016. Hence, a CPE reduction program was formulated. Methods: The CPE reduction program started in July 2016 and focused on three areas: (1) active surveillance screening: Patients who complained of diarrheal symptoms or stayed more than 7 days with antimicrobial therapy were screened for CPE. This enabled early identification and isolation of CPE carriers; (2) Focused hand hygiene compliance improvement program during napkin care and enteral feeding. Concurrent feedbacks were given to frontlines, and results were reported to senior management on monthly basis. (3) Patient environmental care improvement: environmental cleanliness was further maximized by regular ward decontamination by the central cleansing team and ad hoc cleaning once CRE was detected. Staff cleansing technique was assessed by regular procedural and hand hygiene audit. UV fluorescent marker was also utilized and applied to high touch areas including the pantry sinks to monitor their performance. Further environmental measures were initiated including sink decontamination, revised body fluid disposal procedures, revised handling enteral feeding milk and equipment, and patient utensils.",

Conclusion: Our CPE reduction program controlled the nosocomial spread of CPE in our hospital. Early identification and isolation of CPE carriers, enhanced environmental hygiene and focused hand hygiene are essential elements of our success. Finally, good communication and cooperation between frontlines and infection control team are indispensable for any MDRO reduction programs. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on 286 patients treated with mechanical ventilation for more than or equal to 2 calendar days from April 2015 to October 2016. We compared mechanical ventilated patients defined as VAE with patients defined as no VAE. We also analyzed risk factors and clinical outcomes of VAE. Statistical analysis was performed with Chisquare test and significant difference was determined by p < 0.05. Results: Among 286 episodes of mechanical ventilation, 18 episodes were complicated with VAE; 6 of ventilator-associated conditions (VAC), 9 of infection-related VAC (IVAC) and 3 of possible VAP (PVAP). Chest Xp findings were as follows; 11 of pleural effusion, 5 of pulmonary edema, 1 of pneumothrax and 1 of no findings. VAE occurred more frequently in medical ICU than in surgical ICU ( p < 0.0001). The length of ICU stay became longer in VAE ( p < 0.0001). The mortality rate in VAE group was significantly higher than no VAE group ( p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences between VAE group and no VAE group on intravenous volume overload and nutritional management. All patients defined as VAE showed hypoalbuminemia (<3.0 g/dL). Conclusion: Since VAE affects patient's QOL and prognosis, It might be also important to improve malnutrition in VAE patients with nutrition support team for preventing VAE.",

In addition, the weakness point of infection control intervention, fomite transmission, the effect and timing of Tamiflu \u00ae (oseltamivir phosphate) used was discussed in this study. Methods: The action research method was used in order to offer the suitable intervention of infection control on time in the psychiatric hospital. The information about the influenza vaccination rate, the way of Tamiflu \u00ae (oseltamivir phosphate) used, symptoms of influenza, result of influenza rapid screening, epidemic curve of disease transmission was collected. Results: The first patient with influenza-like illness (ILI) was reported by the critical intensive care unit on 22nd of Jan, 2016. Six cases with influenza-like illness were reported after one night. An acute ward, a pediatric and adolescent ward was reported an outbreak event within 7 days. 25 patients and 6 health care professionals were suffered from seasonal influenza in the three psychiatric wards. The influenza vaccination rates among health care professional were 97.65% in average. Unfortunately, the seasonal influenza vaccination rates among psychiatric patients were 44.33% in average. Beside of this, morbidity of seasonal influenza was 15.20% in average. Unfortunately, positive influenza rapid screening result was not higher than expectation (36.36%), even though type A influenza virus (H1N1) was detected and quantitated by real-time RTPCR. Tamiflu \u00ae (oseltamivir phosphate) was applied not only for psychiatric patients, but also for health care professionals. As a result, dosing rate of Tamiflu \u00ae (oseltamivir phosphate) was 82.35% in average. The average days of isolation were 8.7 days in three psychiatric wards. Conclusion: In conclusion, the infection control intervention in the psychiatric ward is not as easy as in the medical or surgical ward due to the movement ability among psychiatric patient. Seasonal influenza vaccination could see as the health prevention intervention to protection patient before influenza season coming. Tamiflu \u00ae (oseltamivir phosphate) dosing could suggest if an outbreak event was occurred in the ward.

Comparing with one case (1.1%) occurred from 2010 to 2015, the results were obviously higher. In order to prevent the spread of disease, the related interventions were implemented immediately. The experience would be shared with the medical profession as a reference. Methods: Bacteria culture laboratory isolated the specimens which fit the CRE drug resistant condition defined by CDC. Then active notification was proceeded and infection control interventions were activated. On June 21, 2016, after discussing with the staffs in the Division of Laboratory Medicine, related interventions were adopted. To clarify whether each individual case is relavant to one another, interventions adopted were investigation in the ward, proceeding the sampling inspection of environment in the ward where the patients have lived as well as the hands of staffs who worked there, and revising the standard operation procedure of multiple-drug resistant strains. Results: By analyzing those 10 cases, one was the patient of healthcare-associated infection while the other 9 weren't. On July 26, 2016, 119 specimens, including those collected from the ward as well as from the hands of staffs, and 1 rectalswab specimen from CRKP case, were sent for inspection. 3 specimens (3.36%) verified to be CRE-KP drug resistance were the same as KPC drug resistant case identified by CDC. They are specimens collected from bedside bar, bedside table, and rectalswab of CRKP case. Conclusion: Colonization often occurs before infection. In this event, 3 specimens from one inpatient and his surroundings were verified to be CRKP through environmental collection and inspection. Although the source of infection can't be confirmed, the investigation was continously proceeded and finally found it resulted from the insufficient concentration of bleach formulated by the staffs. After improvement, we kept following up from August 29th and found no cases in the following two months. Environmental clean and disinfection are the key points of epidemic prevention. This study would be provided to the medical profession as a reference of how to implement the interventions to deal with multiple-drug resistant strains. The key words were as follows: \"citrate\" [tiab] AND \"catheter lock\" AND (\"cancer\" OR \"malignancy\"). Results: In our synthesis of 8 papers, 2 papers met the inclusion criteria distinguished by PICO. Chaftari AM 2017 (level 2) enrolled 60 patients with hematologic malignancies who had peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC),use lock consisted of 15 or 30 \u03bcg/ mL of nitroglycerin in combination with 4% sodium citrate and 22% ethanol. Each lumen was locked for at least 2 h once daily prior to being flushed. It can reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) rate from 1.9/1,000 catheter days to 1.6/1,000 catheter days. The adverse events were one headache and one rash but mild and transient. Rosenblatt J 2013 (level 5) reports on the synergy of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) with citrate and ethanol in rapidly eradicating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans biofilms in an in vitro model for catheter biofilm colonization. Conclusion: Sodium citrate may effective central venous catheter lock solution in hematologic malignancies because of it's antimicrobial and antithrombotic effect. But the evidence was not sufficient,we need to more prospective trails confirmly.",

In 2011, Taiwan has allowed laws for the usage and promotion of SEDs in the daily practice at hospital settings. It is necessary to investigate the effect of using SEDs in term of reducing the incidence of NSIs. Methods: The study was conducted at a medical center with 2300 beds. Since 2011, it has started to promote the usage of SEDs over the hospital phase by phase. Training and education program to prevent healthcare personnel from NSIs were also conducted. Closely monitoring on the incidence and analysis on the underlying mechanisms of NSIs were implented simutaneously. Interventions to improve the medical and practice understanding the factors result in NSIs were performed. Results: The overall incidence of NSIs decreased from 3.90% in 2011 to 2.82% in 2016. The decrease is especially obvious for interns and nurses. In addition, the rate of NSIs caused by conventional devices (including syringe, intravenous catheter, winged needle, insulin syringe, etc.) decreased from 57% in 2011 to 39% in 2016, which resulted from conventional syringe declined from 41.7% in 2011 to 26.9% in 2016. However, the occurrence of NSIs made by the incorrect operating of safety devices and safety devices being not activated had increased from 1.94% in 2011 to 8.97% in 2016. Conclusion: The use of SEDs can effectively prevent NSIs but must work correctly with standard operating procedures. Training and education on the usage of SEDs are necessary before promoting use of SEDs. Keeping and making a more safety workplace environment with sustained efforts should be ongoing to promote occupational health.",

Chimei Medical center Intensive care unit Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) usually causes an asymptomatic infection or produces mild flulikesymptoms; afterward, it remains latent throughout life and may reactivate. In immunocompromised individuals, symptomatic disease usually manifests as a mononucleosis syndrome. Symptomatic CMV disease can affect almost every organ of the body. Rare manifestations of CMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. We present a case of colon cancer and recived chemotherapy with UFUR. However, massive bloody stool passage was found and pandoscopy revealed esophageal ulcer and the pathology confirm CMV infection. Ganciclovir therapy was performed and stopped bleeding after surgical intervention. Case Report: This 81 y/o male patient was admitted due to left femoral intertrochanter comminuted fracture. After admission, surgical treatment was performed on 11/03. Aspiration pneumonia was developed with fever and dyspnea condition after the operation. Due to unstable vital sign and dyspnea, he was transferred to ICU on 11/11 and intubation due to respiratory failure. Broad spectrum antibiotic, septic work-up and fluid resuscitation were perscribed for the patient. Much bloody stool passage was noted on 11/13, GS was consulted and anal fissure bleeding was suspected. However, recurrence of bloody stool was noted, colonoscopy on 11/21 revealed multiple rectal ulcer s/p biopsy. The pathology of rectal ulcer showed favor CMV colitis, thus, ganciclovir was added (11/26-12/2) and combined with antibiotic (Tazobactam/Piperacilin) for pneumonia treatment. We had repeat colonoscopy due to persistent intermittent bloody stool passage, repeat CMV-PCR and antigenemia. The repeat colonscopy showed rectal ulcer with oozing. Antibiotic was adjusted as infection men suggestion, diflucan was added for funguria. The patient's condition became getting stable. Due to negative of antigenemia and negative of stool CMV-PCR, oral form ganciclovir was discontinued (12/2-12/23) after discussing with ID man. Due to improved of clinical symptoms, the patient was discharged on 12/28 in relative stable condition. Discussion: Most gastrointestinal CMV infections respond well to ganciclovir treatment, Independently from the cause of the underlying immunosuppression. Therefore, the patient should be offered an antiviral treatment as soon as possible. Early diagnosis of suspected CMV infection in immunosuppressed patients with gastrointestinal symptoms is of the utmost importance. Repeat endoscopy may be considered if previous study did not meet a conclu gastrointestinal CMV disease should be kept in mind with immunocompromised patient compatible with clinical symptoms.",

In order to evaluate if the mobile e-nursing carts became the media of multi-drug resistant organism (MDRO) transmission, ATP-bioluminescence and culture were performed to assess the efficacy of surface cleaning in 10 high-touch surfaces of mobile e-nursing cart. The mean value of ATP-bioluminescence of the surfaces was 1112.6 RLU. The culture grew 180 isolates of microorganism (56.3%). The result revealed that the cleaning is insufficient. There's no a universal regulation. After investigation the will of cleaning by questionnaire, it correlated with the convenience of cleaning tools. Therefore, this study tried to assess efficacy of cleaning by four different cleaning tools. This study also evaluated the will of medical staff for cleaning the mobile e-nursing cart by different cleaning tools. By the analysis, we try to find out how to increase the will of medical staff for cleaning the mobile e-nursing cart, to make sure the cleaning and to avoid healthcare-associated infection. Methods: 1. The mobile e-nursing carts were cleaned by four different tools. To assess the outcome of cleaning, ten high-touch surfaces of each cart was checked by ATP-bioluminescence after cleaning. 2. Questionnaire was designed to medical staff to evaluate the satisfaction the medical staff for different cleaning tools. Results: 1. The use of four different cleaning tools in the e-nursing carts of the vehicle clean, found that different cleaning products can make the surface after cleaning. The mean value of ATPbioluminescence of the surfaces was 484.5 RLU. 2. Total 128 questionnaire were filled in by medical staff. The questionnaire included the items of convenience, operation, cleaning effect, odor and stimulation to skin. The result showed that the medical staff satisfied with antiseptic wet tissue B. Conclusion: A cleaning tool with convenience to operation, effective cleaning, lower stimulation to skin and smell will increase the will and frequency of cleaning for medical staff.

Hui-Ling Huang 1 *, Wen-Liang Yu 1,2 . 1 Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan, 2 Department of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan Background: Influenza may cause severe disease that needs care in the intensive care unit (ICU). Viral infections in the ICU often involve the respiratory system and can cause significant morbidity and mortality especially in immunocompromised patients. Meanwhile, critically ill patients admitted in ICU are predisposed to many nosocomial infections due to underlying illnesses, various invasive procedures and prolonged hospital stay. We report detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Morganella morganii in a patient after prolonged ICU stay. Both pathogens are often ignored but might be of clinical significance. Methods: Case study. Results: This 78 y/o man had history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease and brain stroke under medication control. He was in acute respiratory distress and required immediate intubation. He was admitted to the ICU. Hemodialysis was used because of increasing metabolic acidosis and progressive pulmonary edema. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal sample was positive for influenza A (H1N1). He completed a 10-day course of oseltamivir therapy. Then piperacillin was used for pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. After 32 days of ICU stay, he was transfer to the Respiratory Care Center (RCC) because of difficulty in weaning ventilator. However, septic shock was noted during stay in RCC. The cultures of blood and sputum yielded M. morganii. Blood Aspergillus galactomannan antigen index was 0.11 (normal, <0.5). In addition, CMV-PCR results of sputum and blood samples were positive. CMV viral load was 9,550 IU/mL. Imipenem had been used for 14 days without anti-CMV treatment. His condition improved thereby and he was successfully extubated and weaned from the ventilator. After 24 days stay in RCC, he was transferred to the ward. He was discharged uneventfully after 71 days of hospital stay. Conclusion: CMV antigenemia is not an uncommon finding in ICU patients with immunocompromised status. Although associated with a higher morbidity and mortality, the clinical significance of CMV in ICU patients is unknown. Meanwhile, the organism M. morganii with proven pathogenicity could be potentially dangerous and should not be overlooked. Thus M. morganii infection was vigorously treated, whereas CMV reactivation was ignored in the current case. It is difficult to discern whether CMV plays a role in post-H1N1 pneumonia status. CMV might be a bystander as no anti-CMV therapy was given, but it might be a contributor associated with prolonged hospital stay.",

A total of 25 (10%) contained pathogens isolated from air in ORs; Coagulase-negative staphylococcus was the most common pathogen, followed by Micrococcus spp., and Staphylococcus. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that free fungi and the number of mean bacterial colonies were far from the suggested levels during surgical activity despite a well-controlled OR ventilation system with a HEPA filter. Air flow conditions in hospital ORs are controlled and regulated to remove airborne microorganisms to help control infections. Methods: The IC team visited bacteriology lab for more information about cotton batting-like material as received abnormal results. Next we visited OR in the company of OR head nurse to investigate and to see whether the number of surgical site infections cases show abnormally increase in the past 6 months. Results: We found green cotton fibers on the top surface of the operation lampshade when visited OR. These green cotton fibers should be from green cloth used to wrap surgical instruments. We speculated cotton fibers scattered when surgical instruments parcels were opened. We also found in sanitary staff's operation procedure that they routinely clean the floor, operation tables, walls and so on, but didn't include operation lampshade and therefore, resulted in fibers accumulation. Environmental cleaning and disinfection were implemented. Air quality monitoring was followed again subsequently and the results were all normal. Also, there were no abnormal increase of surgical site infections [SSI rate was 0.20% (6/2952), there was no significant difference ( p = 0.632) compared with the mean value of pre-infective stage (0.13%)]. Conclusion: Operation room is an important environment where surgery was performed and saving lives. To ensure the OR environment clean and free from pollution is very important. In this case we rechecked and revised sanitary staff's SOP and added works cleaning the top of the lockers and the operation lampshade to avoid accumulation of cotton fibers and dust to cause environmental pollution.",

Colonization with MRSA is well recognized as a major risk factor for subsequent infection. The role of patients' hands has been neglected both in hospitals and LTCFs even though it has been suggested that they may represent an under-recognized reservoir of pathogens. We aimed to determine if education, regular reminders and improved availability of alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) would increase frequency of hand hygiene by elderly residents in long term care capable of performing hand hygiene without assistance. Methods: Nasal swabs were collected from 321 elderly subjects attending community centres for social activities. Swabs were cultured on chromogenic agar. Species identification was performed using MALDI-TOF. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and results interpreted according to EUCAST guidelines. Presence of AR genes was detected by PCR. Figure 1 .

Conclusion: By adopting directly observed hand hygiene for subjects capable of using ABHR without assistance, it should be possible for all residents of a LTCF to achieve improved hand hygiene on three occasions by introducing this methodology before each of the main mealtimes. For elderly unable to perform hand hygiene by themselves, we propose that HCWs physically assist these patients by rubbing the ABHR on their hands for them.

Conclusion: Although we worry that giving more information regarding port-a-cath to the patients and family members will increase probability of disputes occurrence between patients and hospital staff if the staff members don't follow the standard of care, it is necessary to incorporate patients and family numbers into the gatekeeper mode to have a better understanding of clinical quality and thereby enhance education training of practice staff to improve patient safety. Background: Effective control of tuberculosis (TB) requires a close partnership between private and public healthcare providers. An integrated web-based information system is vital and crucial for engaging all relevant healthcare providers in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of TB. Methods: A \"MONITOR\" information system was established in 2016 by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) with single entryway and enhanced capacity and flexibility. Main purpose of the system is to promote more rapid response and provide decision support. Information such as TB epidemiology, case management, treatment, DOTS rate, contact tracing coverage, TB clusters, TB statistics and laboratory data are included in the system. Information without personal data can be viewed online with access permission. Daily laboratory data including AFB-smear, culture, identification, drug susceptibility testing and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) are automatically entered from different interface of diverse information systems in clinical settings and public health sectors. The system provides timely warnings of drug-resistant cases, IGRA-positive cases and high-risk populations to management staff according to their responsibilities. In addition, daily scheduled analyses of laboratory quality indicators, turnaround time and visualized profiles are updated automatically.",

Background: Blood is convenient for the extraction of Treponema pallidum DNA for PCR, but the sensitivity of T. pallidum DNA detection is unsatisfactory. Here, we investigated the effects of different processing procedures on the yield of T. pallidum DNA from blood to improve the sensitivity. Methods: We employed a real-time PCR with the target of tp0574 to evaluate the T. pallidum DNA yield in a series of simulated experiments and from infected rabbit blood, testing different centrifugal forces, processing times, and storage temperatures. Red cell lysis pretreatment was also conducted. Results: The T. pallidum DNA yields following red cell lysis pretreatment were 40.4 times greater from whole blood and 32.4 times greater from residual hematocytes than without pretreatment. For the whole-blood simulated experiments, the T. pallidum DNA yields in the lower layer were 2.8, 4.6, 7.3, 12.6, 15.24, 16.7, 65.1 and 73 .1 times that of the upper layer at the centrifugal forces of 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 5000, 7000, 10,000 and 20,000 g, respectively. However, the T. pallidum DNA yields from clots were only 1% at different centrifugal forces. The infected rabbit blood experiment had similar results to those mentioned above. In addition, sample processing time (within 48 h) and storage temperature (between 4\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C) did not affect T. pallidum DNA extraction efficiency. Conclusion: The T. pallidum DNA yield can be significantly improved by red cell lysis pretreatment and appropriate centrifugation. Furthermore, the DNA extraction yield of T. pallidum is greater from whole blood or residual hematocytes compared with plasma, serum or clots.",

This study evaluated three preparation methods (simple centrifugation, ethanol/formic acid preparation, Sepsityper method) from positive blood culture. Methods: This study was performed between September 2013 and March 2014 at the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital in Seongnam, Republic of Korea. Bottles showing positive blood cultures by BacT/ALERT 3D (bioM\u00e9rieux) were tested. Cultures were subjected to further MALDI-TOF-MS, VITEK II (bioM\u00e9rieux), and Microscan (Siemens Healthcare) analysis. The pellets from three direct preparation methods were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS and the cut-off score was 1.7. Fisher's exact test and McNemar Chi-square test was used; a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For simple centrifugation method, 1.5 mL of broth in tube was centrifugated at 13,500 rpm for one minute and the supernatant was discarded. For ethanol/ formic acid preparation, after simple preparation, non-Sepsityper pellet from aerobic bottle was suspended in 1 mL of 0.26% saponin and washed. The pellet was treated with 75% ethanol, and then in 70% formic acid and acetonitrile. The Sepsityper preparation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results: Total number of identified patient was 83 and 26 were cultured both aerobic and anaerobic bottles. 5 fungi, 7 mixed bacteria, 1 polymicrobial samples were excluded. The samples from Sepsityper method were identified better than other methods ( p < 0.001). Especially in simple centrifugation, Gram positive bacteria were significantly less identified than Gram negative bacteria. echinocandin agents is preferred for C. glabrata infection. We suggest that echinocandin should be started as an empiric antifungal therapy if the blood culture turns positive after 50 h of aerobic incubation.",

In the past, azoles are the only available antifungal prophylactic agents. The novel antifungal agents, echinocandins, had been found to have strong antifungal activity against most isolates of Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of echinocandins for the prevention of invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies. Methods: The following databases were searched: Medline, Pubmed (1966 to May 2017 and Cochrane databases (The Cochrane Library 2017) without language restrictions. We also handsearched the related references. Only randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing azoles and echinocandins were included for further analyses, and all echinocandins (micafungin, caspofungin and anidulafungin) were compared in their effectiveness. Statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager Version 5.3 and meta-analysis was synthesized using the random-effects model. The results was expressed as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and heterogeneity was tested using the Cochran Q statistics generated from the \u03c7 2 test. Results: After quality assessment, we reviewed evidence from 5 RCTs that enrolled 1632 patients with hematologic malignancies who received antifungal agents as prophylaxis for IFIs. There were 3 RCTs comparing micafungin and azoles, and 2 other RCTs comparing caspofungin and azoles. There has no RCT comparing anidulafungin with other antifungal agents. The overall incidence of IFIs has no significant difference between the two echinocandins and azoles (RR:0.84, 95% CI 0.71-1.01). However, subgroup analysis showed that micafungin is more effective than azoles for prevention of IFIs (RR:0.78, 95% CI 0.61-0.98), and caspofungin has similar effects with azoles (RR:0.94, 95% CI 0.72-1.23).

The knowledge of antibiotics susceptibility of different Candida species may help clinicians in treatment planning. Methods: We retrieved the data of the Candida species in patients with candidemia during the period from 2014 to 2016. The yeast identification methods included window test, CHROMagar Candida, Urease, Pellicle, API-20 C AUX, and VITEK 2 YST. We also performed yeast drug susceptibility test by ATB FUNGUS 3. The Interpretive guidelines for in vitro susceptibility testing of Candida species were applied according to the CLSI M27-S3. Results: There were 50 colonies of Candida species in candidemia. C. albicans [n = 21 (42%)] was the most commen species, followed by C. parapsilosis [n = 10 (20%)], C. glabrata [n = 7 (14%)], C. tropicalis [n = 6 (12%)], C. guiliermondii complex [n = 2 (4%)], C. krusei [n = 1 (2%)], C. inconspicua [n = 1 (2%)], C. haemilonii [n = 1 (2%)], C. lusitaniae [n = 1 (2%)]. We also performed anti-fungal drug susceptibility tests including Flucytosine, Amphotericin B, Voriconazole, Fluconazole, and Intraconazole for 82 Candida colonies isolated from aseptic specimens. C. albicans (n = 42) and C. tropicalis (n = 9) was susceptible to Intraconazole with sensitivity of 98% and 67%, respectively. Both species were susceptible to other antifungal agents. However, C. glabrata (n = 12) was indiscernibly susceptible to Fluconazole and Intraconazole but had susceptible rates to Amphotericin B, Flucytosine, Voriconazole with 100%, 92% and 83%, respectively. All of C. parapsilosis (n = 12) and C. lusitaniae (n = 1) were susceptible to all antifungal agents. C. krusei (n = 3) was a species with intrinsic resistance to Fluconazole. The susceptibility of C. krusei to Flucytosine was intermediate, and had the susceptible rates of 100% and 67% to Voriconazole and Amphotericin B, respectively. C. guiliermondii complex (n = 2) were susceptible to all anti-fungal agents except intermediately susceptible to Intraconazole. C. Inconspicua (n = 1) was intermediately susceptible to Fluconazole and Intraconazole and susceptible to other antifugal agents. Conclusion: C. albicans remains the most common species found in patients with Candidemia, which is similar to reports in other countries. Nevertheless, the incidence is decreasing to be less than 50%. C. tropicalis is not the second common species, but C. parapsilosis or C. glabrata. The knowledge of the distribution of anti-fungal drug susceptibility of different Candida species in the hospital may help clinicians in prescription planning.",

At our institution, ophthalmological examinations are routinely performed in patients with candidemia based on the bundle approach (Takesue Y et al., JAC, 2015; 70: 587-93.) . Methods: The incidence of ocular candidiasis among patients with candidemia, the timing of diagnosis, the vitreous body involvement rate, antifungal use, and clinical outcomes were reviewed in non-neutropenic adult patients with ocular candidiasis that were reated between April 2007 and December 2016. Results: Among 120 candidemia patients, 116 underwent ophthalmological examinations, and ocular candidiasis was detected in 28 patients (24.1%). Twenty-one patients were diagnosed at the initial examination (median 4 days from the culture of the blood sample positive), and 7 further patients were diagnosed at follow-up examinations (median 11 days). Vitreous body involvement was detected in 9 of 28 patients (32.1%). Among the 24 conscious patients, 9 complained of visual abnormalities (37.5%). Candida albicans was the most commonly detected causative agent in the patients' blood specimens, and the C. albicans isolation rates of the patients with and without ocular candidiasis differed significantly (92.9% vs. 31.1%, P < 0.001). The patients with ocular candidiasis had significantly higher \u03b2-D-glucan values (278.4 \u00b1 212.6 pg/mL vs. 132.6 \u00b1 197.6 pg/mL, P = 0.001). Treatment success (an improvement in the patient's clinical data and the resolution of ocular disease confirmed by an ophthalmological examination) was achieved in 20 of 28 patients (71.4%) and visual recovery was obtained in 7 of 8 patients (88.9%). The 28-day mortality rate was 7/28 patients (25%). Fluconazole, voriconazole, and liposomal amphotericin B were administered as initial antifungals to 10, 4, and 14 patients, respectively. As alternative selection, voriconazole was used in 4 and liposomal amphotericin B in 6 patients.",

Department of Pharmacy, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan Background: Fluconazole was amongst the first line of antifungal agent in invasive candidiasis in Taiwan. Different Candida species showed various susceptibilities to fluconazole which dosedependent sensitive of fluconazole posed concern on its efficacy. Methods: This retrospective study included 194 adult patients with candidemia who has treated with antifungal agents at least 48 hours from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2014. We recorded patient's medical history and laboratory data during treatment. Mortality 14 days after the end of treatment and pathogen eradication rate were primary and secondary endpoint respectively. Logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel test were utilized to analysis the variant that might influence clinical outcome. Results: Mortality rate and pathogen distribution were Candida albicans (30.7%, 45.4%), C. tropicalis (37.2%, 22.2%), C. parapsilosis (25.9%, 13.9%), C. glabrata (28.0%, 12.9%) and other Candida species (27.3%, 5.7%) respectively. Overall mortality rate was 30.9%. C. tropicalis infection has higher mortality rate, but no statistical significant. Overall eradication rate was 79.4%. C. albicans infection was higher proportion to clear (86.4%, median: 8 days) then C. glabrata (68.0%, median: 9 days) ( p = 0.56). Fluconazole was used as initial treatment in almost all case (96.4%) and 80.9% of fluconazole dose adjusted by renal function and weight accordingly, but only 37.1% of them gave loading dose. Logistic regression found that continue treatment with another 2 weeks after documented clearance was significant associated with survival rate (Odds ratio: 5.6, 95% CI: 2.18-14.38). However, to give fluconazole loading dose and to keep maintenance dose of fluconazole more then 6 mg/kg were showed no significant associated to mortality rate and pathogen eradication. Conclusion: In this study, adequate treatment course of fluconazole is associated with patient survival. Even if different Candida species do not reveal poor clinical outcome, but a new treatment strategy of candidemia for increasing fluconazole-resistance Candida pathogen is necessary.",

Immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible. Methods: A 27-year-old MSM was admitted for 2-week history of FUO in Aug., 2013. He complained of fever, dizziness, sore throat, purulent sputum, cough, and myalgia. He denied abdominal pain or diarrhea. He received antipyretics, which did not resolve the fevers. He had been treated with entecavir for HBV infection for 4 years. He was found to be HIV-infected on admission. His CD4 was 42 cells/uL, and he was started on zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine. Chest X-ray (CXR) revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. He also had reactive RPR and positive TP-PA in both the serum and CSF. Intravenous penicillin treatment was administered for neurosyphilis, and the patient partially improved with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim treatment. Then the patient developed generalized erythematous patches and plaques, which was attributed to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim or nevirapine. Nevirapine was changed to Kaletra, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim to clindamycin. He was diagnosed with PCP by sputum PCR, but CXR did not improve. Toxoplasma serology and IHA for ameba were negative. Results: The patient was again febrile on hospital day 12 and blood PCR confirmed CMV infection. Whole body Gallium scan showed increased uptake of bilateral lungs without other focus of infections. He became afebrile after initiating intravenous ganciclovir treatment, but still CXR did not improve. Chest HRCT revealed mixed alveolar and interstitial lesions of bilateral lungs, and patchy consolidation of hilar regions. Pathology of bronchoscopic biopsy revealed fungal infection, and amphotericin B (AmB) was added. The patient could not tolerate conventional AmB due to rigors and fevers, and we replaced it with the liposomal formulation. After 2 weeks of liposomal AmB treatment, his antifunal therapy was changed to oral itraconazole treatment. Culture of bronchoalveolar lavage grew a filamentous fungus ( Figure) , and PCR confirmed the isolate as a Basidiomycota sp., Ceriporia lacerata. The patient was treated with oral itraconazole for 6 months. No recurrence was found after a 3 year follow-up. Conclusion: Fungal infections account for a large number of AIDSindex diagnoses and complicate the course of many patients with HIV infection. Clinical suspicion and broader recognition of diseases caused by filamentous fungi among clinicians and microbiologists would improve therapeutic experience and selection of better treatment strategies. Background: Candida glabrata species complex includes Candida glabrata sensu stricto and two major cryptic species, Candida nivariensis and Candida bracarensis. Distinction of these species is relevant for epidemiological purposes and for antifungal management. Phenotypic identification methods frequently misidentify these species as \"C. glabrata.\" Hence their identification depends on molecular methods, or by MALDI-TOF MS. Although DNA sequencing of the fungal rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region or the D1/D2 region of the 28S rRNA gene is accurate, molecular analysis is time-consuming and expensive. In the present study, we sought to examine the ability of the Vitek MS and Burker MS systems to differentiate between the species within the C. glabrata complex, using a variety of software including ClinProTools. Methods: Two commercial MALDI-TOF MS systems (Vitek MS system [bioM\u00e9rieux] and the Bruker MS system [Bruker Daltoniks]) employing the Vitek MS RUO and Bruker ClinProTools programs, respectively were evaluated for the identification of 33 isolates of C. glabrata complex (17 C. glabrata, 14 C. nivarensis, 2 C. bracarensis). Results: C. glabrata sensu stricto was identified correctly by both systems with distinct principle components compared with the two cryptic species. All C. nivariensis and C. bracarensis could not be identified to species level by the Vitek MS v2.0 IVD and Bruker Biotyper MS v3.1, but were all correctly identified by the Vitek MS RUO. The generic algorithm model from ClinProTools software showed 100% recognition capability and cross validation for the discrimination of C. nivariensis and C. bracarensis. Spectra peak statistics revealed that five markers (3292.47Da, 4152.64Da, 6245.75Da, 6585.15Da and 7304.68Da) can reliably distinguish between C. nivariensis and C. bracarensis, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.928, 0.9998, 1, 1 and 1, respectively. A small \"inhouse\" Bruker spectral database was established incorporating spectra of two clinical isolates representing C. nivariensis and C. bracarensis identified in this study. After complementation with the \"in-house\" database, all the remaining 14 C. nivariensis and C. bracarensis isolates were correctly identified to species level (score >2.00). Conclusion: MALDI-TOF MS enabled rapid and reliable identification of C. glabrata complex isolates. The use of the Vitek MS RUO system, Bruker ClinProTools software and the addition of MSP to Bruker MS databases representing the local diversity of isolates assisted with achieving differentiation of cryptic species within C. glabrata complex. Background: The Gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus faecalis and the fungus Candida albicans are both common opportunistic pathogens in human body, such as the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. An estimated 27-56% of nosocomial C. albicans bloodstream infections are polymicrobial. The top three most commonly co-isolated bacterial species were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus aureus. Previous in vitro studies showed that E. faecalis could inhibit the C. albicans hyphal morphogenesis and reduce its biofilm formation, furthermore co-infection of E. faecalis and C. albicans in mice resulted in less mortality than infection with either species alone. However, in clinical mixed bloodstream infection associated with Candida and Enterococcus is rare but it causes with worse clinical outcomes in immune compromise cancer patient. The interaction between these two microbes in mixed-type infection in bloodstream, i.e. the planktonic form is investigated in this study. Methods: The epidemiology of bloodstream infection with E. faecalis, C. albicans, and mixed infection cases collected from Chi-Mei hospital were analyzed. RPMI-1640 medium was used to co-culture the two microbes for testing their interaction in growth. An in vitro biofilm assay was used to study the influence of yeast form C. albicans mixed infection with E. faecalis. The drug susceptibilities against antibiotics, ampicillin and gentamicin, and antifungals, caspofungin and amphotericin B, of these microbes will be analyzed to check their phenotypic changes that associate with virulence. Results: In Candida-associated mixed bloodstream infection, the incidence of infection cases with E. faecalis is significantly higher than any other gut bacteria. Similar to previous reports, the decrease in biofilm formation in C. albicans was proved by an in vitro biofilm assay. The resistance to antibiotic was enhanced in E. faecalis by co-cultured with C. albicans. Conclusion: The interaction of E. faecalis and C. albicans might alter the antibiotic susceptibility of E. faecalis in patients, no matter presenting in biofilm or planktonic forms. A special attention must her. Generally, acute hepatitis caused by LTBI treatment with isoniazid is quite rare. At present, the exact mechanism of Isoniazid related hepatotoxicity is still unclear. It might be related to age, slow acetylation to toxic Hydrazine metabolites, or CYP450 2E1 homozygous wild type (CYP2E1c1/c1 genotype). Conclusion: For adverse events of acute hepatitis induced by LTBI treatment with isoniazid, we recommended to trace liver function 1-2 times every week closely, especially those patients whose liver function fail to recover after quitting medication. In conclusion, during the treatment, paying highly attention to the patient's clinical symptoms with closely tracking the biochemical tests of blood, treating the adverse events in time, are all important to ensure the completion of treatment and achieve the purpose of cure.",

For example, in early 2016, the epidemic was so severe that it led to massive crowd in emergency rooms of many teaching hospitals, shortage of human resource in intensive care unit (ICU) and insufficient availability of ECMO. On the other hand, since the exchanges of cross-strait between Taiwan and mainland China becomes more frequent, the diversity of influenza virus has increased. Therefore, we should understand the spatio-temporal distributions of mild and severe cases of influenza and their associated factors. Methods: We use the software, Satscan, to discover the areas that suffer from high incidences of influenza-like illness (ILI). Then we went further to understand the epidemiology of the illness in these areas to figure out the risk factors, such as weather conditions, population density, air pollution, or poultry farms density. Finally, we confirmed the strength of the association between the risk factors and the disease by using the regression model. Results: Air Quality Index (AQI) refers to the impact of daily concentrations of six substances including O 3 , PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO 2 and NO 2 . AQI can imply the degree of effect of the air pollution on our health. It is also well-documented that the respiratory system becomes more sensitive during the period of poor air quality and in addition to the condition of local weather. Such an interaction of weather and air pollution may help us observe that cases of respiratory illness increase after certain time lags. Therefore, the higher incidences of influenza-like illness would occur more frequently in those time periods with poor air quality, and those areas with severe problems of air pollution. Conclusion: We hope that the results from this study involving AQI, local weather, and more implications from epidemiology of mild and severe influenza cases altogether can provide an early warning for harm reduction of influenza-like illness and implementing the most appropriate preventive measures.",

Division of General Medicine, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center Background: Infective endocarditis is a severe disease with high morbidity and mortality rates. Health care providers worldwide should consider means to prevent this disease; however, guidelines related this topic differ among industrialized countries. The author makes close examination of these guidelines. Methods: The guidelines of the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) are the most notable, but do not contain prescription recommendations for prophylactic antibiotics, while the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends antibiotics for only the highest-risk individuals, and only during dental procedures. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends antibiotics for the highest-risk individuals during dental, urological, gastroenterological, dermatological, and other invasive procedures. In contrast, the Japanese Society of Cardiology recommends antibiotics for a broader range of individuals including those with lower risk such as during procedures for almost all congenital and valvular heart diseases. In addition, the recommendation in the NICE guideline has been changed slightly because an English population-based study revealed higher incidence of endocarditis after the introduction of an aggressive new guideline in 2008. One reason for the many differences among guidelines might be that no randomized control trial has been conducted on the prophylactic effect of antibiotics for individual at risk of endocarditis; therefore, guideline formulating committees do not do not have access to concrete evidence. In terms of causative pathogens of endocarditis, staphylococcal endocarditis, which is unpreventable by oral amoxicilline, has increased worldwide. Findings from studies in East Asia, including Japan, show that up to one third of endocarditis cases are caused by Streptococcus spp. Moreover, as states in all major guidelines, oral hygiene is more important than dental procedures for preventing Streptococcus infection. Results: A historical cohort study reveals indirect evidence for prevention of endocarditis with amoxicilline, which indicates that the UK guidelines might be insufficient. The Japanese guidelines implemented standard practices driven more by the local political climate than scientific evidence. On the basis of current evidence, neither the AHA nor the ESC guidelines can be considered superior to the other. Conclusion: Primary care physicians and dentists should consider prophylaxis against endocarditis during dental procedures as recommended AHA or ESC.",

The seasonal occurrence of scrub typhus varies according to the climates in different countries, and the disease occurs more commonly during rainy seasons. Forest clearings, riverbanks, and grassy regions provide optimal conditions for mites. I-lan country is in the northeastern of Taiwan with unique northeast monsoon climate region. By the record of Notifiable Infectious Diseases in one community hospital of I-Lan during the year 2012-2016, 19 confirmed cases, 16 cases (84%) occurs in winter (12 cases in January, 2 case in February, 2 case in December).

Methods: For this study, monthly data of cases number were obtained from the Notifiable Infectious Diseases Statistics System and Infectious Diseases Database at the Taiwanese Center for Disease Control. The scrub typhus is a 4 th grade notifiable disease, blood samples from patients with suspected scrub typhus were collected and sent to the CDC for laboratory confirmation. Confirmed diagnosis for scrub typhus are based on a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test, or a 4-fold increase in OTspecific immunoglobulin M or immunoglobulin G antibody of paired sera by using an indirect immunofluorescence assay technique.

These findings may provide valuable information in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the disease in the local area. Background: To determine whether intestinal Angiostrongylus cantonensis antigens can induce protective immunity in rats, gut antigens prepared from female adults (FAGP) and somatic antigens prepared from both male (MA) and female (FA) adult worms were used to immunize rats. Methods: Rats were immunized twice with MA, FA, or FAGP antigens and then challenged with 50 third-stage A. cantonensis larvae, and different readouts were used to monitor protective immunity. Additionally, protein profiles of MA, FA, and FAGP extracts were analyzed and characterized by immunodetection methods. Results: A 15% reduction in fifth-stage larvae from brains and a 14% reduction in adult worms from pulmonary arteries were observed in rats immunized with FAGP compared to controls. However, there was a >50% reduction in rats immunized with MA or FA. The lengths of larvae and adults recovered from FAGP-immunized rats were shorter than those recovered from other groups. The number of first-stage larvae recovered from fecal material in FAGP-immunized rats was significantly reduced. Additionally, FAGP induced the highest splenocyte proliferation. Serum IgG titers were not directly correlated with protective immunity. An 84 kDa gut membrane protein was strongly recognized by anti-FAGP antibodies, which may be important in anti-A. cantonensis immune responses. Conclusion: We demonstrated that immune responses induced by FAGP reduced the growth, development, and reproduction of A. cantonensis in subsequent infections. While the possibility of using FAGP combining with MA or FA antigens as a multi-function vaccine in immune protection against A. cantonensis needs to be further elucidated, we hope that it provides a novel strategy for this parasite vaccine development.",

When the vaccination records were kept in the infection control office, assuming the examination cost was $15 per person and the vaccination cost was $70, the expenses of at least $2,210 could be reduced. Conclusion: It is speculated that the measles antibody decreases markedly year by year. In order to take measures against nosocomial infection, HCWs need to accurately manage the vaccination history twice, not once. Managing the vaccination record in the infection control office is more reliable and more economical than the procedure that repeats the test.",

Background: Routine immunization with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7/PCV10/PCV13) increased the incidence of non-vaccine serotypes in community and clincal isoaltes, this increased the need for developing pneumococcal protein vaccines that have broader serotype coverage. Since neuraminidases are major virulence proteins they are potential targets for both vaccines and small molecule inhibitors. In this study, we explored the possibility of combining the three neuraminidases together as vaccine antigens to devise a universal protein vaccine to prevent systemic pneumococcal infection. Methods: To evaluate the degree of protection of NanA, NanB and NanC protein antigens against S. pneumoniae intravenous challenge, individual or combination of neuraminidases NanA, NanB and NanC (10 \u03bcg each) were injected subcutaneously. To confirm the presence of anti-neuraminidase antibodies in the antisera, we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). S. pneumoniae cell suspension was used to infect immunized ice by tail vein injection. The antisera against individual neuraminidase (NanA, NanB or NanC) were also tested for their inhibitory effect on the activity of neuraminidases. If a specific antineuraminidase serum neutralizes neuraminidase activity, the exposure of Thomsen-Friedenrich antigen (TA) antigen on RBC cells, and the value of fluorescence intensity will be reduced. Results: We observed high (4-6 logarithm fold) IgG class antibody titres against NanA, NanB, and NanC; this indicates that all the three neuraminidases are immunogenic and ideal as antigens for immunization. We found that the antisera against only full length NanA and NanA-Lectin efficiently inhibited (>90%) neuraminidase activity. However, antisera against lectin domains of NanB and NanC were sufficient to neutralize their enzyme activity. Immunization with combination of NanA, NanB and NanC caused significant increase in survival rates relative to PPV23 vaccine group and negative control, in serotype 3, 6B, 14, 15B, 19A and 23F survival was 60%, 60%, 20%, 60%, 40% and 40%, respectively. Conclusion: In future formulations of pneumococcal virulence proteins and adjuvants will be needed to develop serotype independent protection against pneumococcal infections. We recommend the inclusion of three pneumococcal neuraminidases in future protein vaccine formulations to prevent IPD.",

Results: The number of isolates recovered in each epidemiological year was constant and similar to that of 2011-12, except 2015-16 but this may be due to the fact that we are still receiving isolates from participating laboratories. Overall, 37 different capsular types, as well as non-typable isolates were detected. Although most isolates expressed capsular types included in PCVs, serotypes not included in any PCV formulation accounted for a significant fraction of the isolates (50%, n = 111). Among these, serotypes 10A, 24F, 8, 15B, 12B were the most frequent, represented by at least 10 isolates each. Regarding PCV serotypes, isolates expressing serotype 14 (n = 25), serotype 1 (n = 18), serotypes 3 (n = 14) serotype 7F (n = 13), 6B (n = 12) and 19A (n = 10) were the most frequently found. Overall, 23% of the isolates were penicillin non-susceptible. Resistance to erythromycin was expressed by 22% of the isolates and simultaneous expression of erythromycin resistance and penicillin nonsusceptibility was found in 14% of the isolates. Conclusion: PCV13 serotypes are still expressed by a considerable proportion of isolates responsible for IPD.

New evidence (detected viruses with PCR within the facial nerve) implies that Bell's palsy is caused by latent herpes viruses. Methods: We clinically evaluated 10 patient, 17-65 years old, withpheripheral facial palsy. The patients are clinically assessed for the severity of facial nerve damage and scored with the House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system. They were sreen with routine blood test,thyroid hormone evaluation,serology for herpes Zoster and Borreliaburgdoferi; MRI of the head with gandolinium; was requested to have nerve conduction studies. Results: 6 patient were female, 4 male, 5 patient are scored with grade II, 3 with grade III, 1with grade I and 1 with grade IV at House -Brackmannscale. Six patients were positive for herpes Zoster. None of them had vesicular eruption. In eight patient was normal MRI, in two of them,internal acoustic meatalsegment of the facial nerve was enhanced only on the affected side. At the conduction studies four had demyelination of the nerve, two severe axonal damage(with Zoster positive antibodies and have eanhancment at the internal acoustic meatal segment of the facial nerve in the affected side) Patients with Yosterpositive and Zoster negative were treated with corticosteroid and antiviral therapy. In five patient with facial nerve damage was totally recovered, in two significant improvement, three of them remainwith severe sequelae. The recuperation was greaterat the patient that was used corticosteroids and antiviral therapy (acyclovir, valacyclovir)even in them with Zoster negative antibodies. The patient with severe sequelae were from the group with Zoster ntibodies,with enhancement in the MRI and with axonal damage at the conduction studies. Conclusion: New evidences ipliestha Bell's palsy isa caused by latent herpes viruses. Considering zoster even without eruption and start antiviral therapy, is important sinceit is thought to be the cause of Bell's palsy in quite a number of cases. Although the number of cases at this study are small to have significant statistically conclusion. Background: Several new direct antiviral agents (DAAs) against the HCV virus are approved and marketed. The combination of DAA with SOC ( pegylated interferon and ribavirin) is only recommended to patients with tolerance to interferon. Therefore several IFN-free treatments are now considered, including NS3/4A protease inhibitors, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, and NS5A inhibitors. TG-2349 is a novel protease inhibitor of the acylsulfonamide class, and is orally active with significant plasma and liver exposures from an once-a-day dosing regimen for CHC. DAG181 is a NS5A inhibitor. It has superior potency in cell-based assays. This in vitro study examined the potential of combining TG-2349 with DAG181 to reduce HCV replicon colonies. Methods: Cells containing a genotype 1a or 1b sub-genomic replicon carrying the neo gene were plated in 6-well plates and treated with either one or two compounds at 1, 10 or 20 x EC 50 . Culture medium was changed twice a week and cells were split at 95% confluence. Results: On HCV 1a H/SG-neo replicon, the number of colonies reduced dramatically to below 110 when TG-2349 was combined with DAG181. Numbers of 109 \u00b1 1, 6 \u00b1 5, and 2 \u00b1 3 were found for TG-2349 at 1.5, 15, and 30 nM, respectively, when combined with DAG181 at 74 pM. With 150 pM of DAG181 included, the number of colonies further reduced to 65 \u00b1 43, 1 \u00b1 1, and 1 \u00b1 1 for TG-2349 levels of 1.5, 15, and 30 nM, respectively. Another replicon, HCV 1b PI-Luc/neo-ET, with a more dramatic reduction of colony count was observed when the combination of TG-2349 and DAG181 were applied. Numbers of 2 \u00b1 2, 0, and 0 were found for TG-2349 at 1.5, 15, and 30 nM, respectively, with 74 pM of DAG181. Addition of DAG181 at 150 pM resulted in cell colony numbers of 1 \u00b1 1, 1 \u00b1 1, and 0 for TG-2349 at 1.5, 15, and 30 nM, respectively. Conclusion: No antagonistic effect on the number of resistance colonies was observed when combinations of TG-2349 and DAG181 were investigated. Significant reduction of the number of resistance colonies were observed when TG-2349 was combined with DAG181. These studies indicated that the combination of TG-2349 and DAG181 has at least an additive, if not synergistic antiviral effect.",

Background: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC) are an important mechanism of carbapenem resistance of Gram-negative bacteria. Lately, KPC-producing bacteria are rapidly increasing in clinical settings and their high drug-resistance is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Especially, KPC-producing K. pneumoniae has been spread rapidly worldwide and it becomes a major hospital pathogen. Herein, we characterized the novel Klebsiella phage \u0392\u03c6-N133 (YMC16/01/N133_KPN_BP), which can lyse KPC-producing K. pneumoniae clinical strains. Methods: K. pneumoniae lytic phages were isolated by using the agar double-layered method from sewage samples from a university hospital in South Korea. Their host ranges were determined by the spot test with 58 KPC-K. pneumoniae clinical strains. Whole genome sequencing was performed using the Illumina Miseq sequencer. The isolated phage was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, one-step growth curve, adsorption rate, thermal/pH stability analysis, and bacterial lysis assay.",

It showed a very broad host range lysing clinical KPC-K. pneumoniae strains of 42 out of 58 (72%). Whole genome analysis of \u0392\u03c6-N133 exhibited double-stranded DNA with 53,443 bp, a G + C content of 59.3% and 75 putative open reading frames, and known toxin-related genes were not identified in silico. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis results revealed that the whole genome of phage \u0392\u03c6-N133 is a novel genome that has no BlastN matchs with any other Klebsiella phage genomes in the NCBI database. One-step growth and adsorption curve showed the latent period of 60 min, the burst size of 17 plaque forming units/infected cell and adsorption rate of over 89% within 10 min. The strain showed the broad pH stability in the pH range 5-10 from 1 day up to 4 days, with the high thermal stability observed at 40 and 50\u00b0C. Bacterial growth was strongly inhibited by \u0392\u03c6-N133 at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 10. Conclusion: A novel Klebsiella phage \u0392\u03c6-N133 was isolated and characterized using clinical KPC-K. pneumoniae strains. These results showed that \u0392\u03c6-N133 can facilitate development of alternative antibacterial agents to treat infectious diseases caused by KPC-K. pneumonia. In vivo safety and efficacy of \u0392\u03c6-N133 will be examined in further studies. Background: Most people infected with Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) remain asymptomatic carriers. Its prevalence in Taiwan was only 0.5%. We present a case of HTLV-1 related adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Methods: Patient was a 58-year-old retired nurse. She suffered needlestick injuries over 20 years, and her blood was rejected for donation at a blood bank 4 years ago. She received a report from blood bank, and someone interpreted it as having HIV infection. But HIV infection was never confirmed. Three weeks ago she had intermittent fevers, night sweats, and general malaise. She then developed general lymphadenopathy over bilateral neck, axillary, and inguinal regions three days prior to admission. Acute retroviral syndrome was suspected but HIV EIA and Western blot were negative. Results: Laboratory testing revealed mild leukocytosis, 9% atypical lymphocytes, CD4: 824/\u03bcL. Chlamydia IgM was positive, strategies was applied as follows: to use QR code to convenient online education course, regular monitoring of the standard procedures, to use red alarm marker at the level of 1000ml on the Foley bag, regular audit for correct Foley catheter insertion, in-hospital broadcasting of proper hand washing, to setup procedure to remind the attending doctor by nurses orally, to show the days of Foley catheter insertion on computer, and to use special trolley for Foley catheterization. Evaluation of the effectiveness includes monthly audit of the correct rate of the Foley catheter insertion and daily care by nursing staffs, and the test for the knowledge about CAUTI bundle care. Results: Before conducting the CAUTI bundle care in our hospital, CAUTI rate was 1.4\u2030 (2/1426 person-day) in March to June 2016. After this plan, CAUTI rate during the same period in 2017 was reduced to 0.73\u2030 (1/1364 person-day). Knowledge measurement of CAUTI bundle care increased from 87.4% to 96.4% after the strategies (Figure 1 ). Correct rate of the Foley catheterization and daily care were changed from 84.5% and 86% to 99.4% and 100%, respectively ( Figure 2 ). Conclusion: During the initial period of CAUTI-Bundle Care plan, our nursing staffs thought that it was not necessary to perform this plan due to the manpower shortage and the limited resources at our hospital. In addition, there was lower CAUTI rate of our hospital compared to other local ones. After understanding the upgraded evidence of practice guidelines of prevention and maintenance of Foley catheter, they later realized and accepted the promotion of the plan. After the systemic strategies, correct execution rate by nursing staff can achieve 100% and CAUTI rate can further reduce by 0.67\u2030. Our study showed that CAUTI Bundle Care plan can be executed correctly by a series of promoting strategies and further reduce CAUTI rate. In future, we expect this CAUTI Bundle Care to be a part of our regular medical care. By computer assist, the workload could be reduced. Finally the CAUTI Bundle Care will be promoted to other medical branches in our health system to promote nursing care quality and to reduce CAUTI rate.",

Implementation rate can achieve to 100% in each unit within seven weeks after application of the plan ( Figure 2 ) (six weeks, five weeks and four weeks for general ward, RCC, and ICU, respectively). Conclusion: Based on the psychological theory, a habitual behavior would be acquired through repetition of the action or the experience. At the beginning of the implementation, it took much time to remind and educate the staffs because they did not form a habit to carry out the bundle care in daily practice yet. After the establishment of the habit, the implementation rate can achieve to 100% within five to seven weeks. Different duration to achieve maximized implementation rate could be related to the different bed numbers of each unit. The less the bed numbers, the shorter the duration to achieve 100% implementation rate. VAP rate did not change much after the application of this plan .The possible explanation for this is that the VAP rate was already low in our hospital before, and that there is not enough time to observe evident change of the VAP rate.",

For this study, we have used a longitudinal community-based birth cohort study -Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) -to investigate the nature of HPeV infections in unselected healthy infants. Methods: Stool (n = 11,201) and nasal (n = 11,515) swabs from 158 healthy infants were collected weekly, and daily symptoms were recorded by parents from birth until their child's 2 nd birthday. Samples were posted to the QPID laboratory where nucleic acid was extracted. We used an RT-PCR assay to screen extracts for HPeVs.

The homology search results showed that there are at least 12 gene products of virus Mta related with DNA rolling circle replication which include the DNA primase, DNA ligase, DNA helicase, DNA polymerase III and Rep B protein at various level of amino acid identity (25 to 69%). Conclusion: We report here a novel lytic DNA virus (Mta) isolated from M. taiwanensis CYW4 T . M. taiwanensis CYW4 T was enriched and isolated from the deep sea methane hydrate habitat, where large amount of biological methane from methanoarchaea were accumulated to form methane hydrate. The lytic virus may play important role as the acceleration factor in deep sea carbon cycle.

The aim of this study was to compare data on etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in CA-UTIs in Croatian outpatients between years 2005 and 2016 and to analyze the influence of antibiotic usage on bacterial susceptibility. Methods: Urinary specimens were collected in the course of routine clinical diagnostics procedures of Zagreb outpatient population. Susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion method only on isolates from urine samples fulfilling criteria for significant bacteriuria. A comparison were made between the tree study periods with a five year interval. Ambulatory consumption of antibiotics was compared as defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day. Results: A total of 22.046 urine specimens were obtained in 2005, and a total of 35.171 urine specimens were collected in 2010. The biggest number, a total of 65.385 urine specimens were collected in 2015. Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen isolated (54.9%). Highest resistance rates in E. coli were detected in 2005 to amoxicillin (46.1%), co-trimoxasole (28.9%) and cephalexin (21.3%).",

TOL/TAZ demonstrated a good in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of aerobic gram-negative species. Overall, 84.8% of all combined Enterobacteriaceae isolates (n = 446) were inhibited at the drug concentrations of \u22642 mg/L (CLSI susceptible breakpoint) with MIC 90 value of 8 mg/L. In particular, TOL/TAZ was highly active versus Citrobacter koseri (n = 15), Escherichia coli (n = 125), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 30), Morganella morganii (n = 15) and Proteus mirabilis (n = 30) with MIC 90 values of 0.25, 1, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. With the exception of colistin (100% susceptibility), TOL/TAZ had the best overall activity versus P. aeruginosa (94% susceptibility; MIC 90 = 4 mg/L), in comparison to cefepime (64% S; MIC 90 = 32), imipenem (59% S, MIC 90 >8), meropenem (71% S, MIC 90 >8), and PIP/TAZ (54% S, MIC 90 >128). Conclusion: TOL/TAZ demonstrated potent in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients in Taiwan medical centers from 2012 to 2015.

In order to prevent aerosol transmitted diseases, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), to healthcare workers and nearby patients, timely evaluation and intervention are very important. So routine chest X-ray and sputum survey for acid-fast stain (AFS) and culture for MTB are essential when a new patient was hospitalized. Methods: From 2015 to 2016, all new patients hospitalized to RCC and RCW received chest image and sputum examination for three consecutive days, which is sent for AFS and culture for MTB (TB culture). If positive AFS result was notified, nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) will done further. MGIT solid and liquid medium were used for TB culture. If acid-fast positive bacteria are isolated, Capilia TB assay or BluePoint MycoID Plus kit is used to identified MTB or not. Results: In RCC, 122 new patients were included. One patient was suspected MTB in chest image study. AFS was positive in one patient, and NAAT was negative in further examination. TB culture was positive in five patients, four were finally diagnosed as NTM and one was confirmed MTB. The incidence of MTB was 0.82%. In RCW, there were 27 new patients. Chest image was no suspected MTB patient. AFS was positive in one patient, and NAAT test was negative. TB culture was positive in 4 patients, and three was diagnosed as NTM and one was confirmed MTB. The incidence of MTB was 3.7%. The mean ago was 78.7 year-old, mean duration from sputum collection to MGIT report was 24.1 days, another 5.7 days was needed for identification. Conclusion: In the 2 years survey, there were 2 patients diagnosed MTB in RCC and RCW respectively. Routine chest X-ray, sputum analysis for AFS & TB culture enabled early diagnosis and therapy for MTB. It also shortened the accidental exposure duration of healthcare workers and other hospitalized patients and avoided MTB outbreak in the facilities.

Hong Kong has 358,900 foreign domestic helpers. Employment agencies provide pre-job hygiene training but monitoring service is rare. Although guidance notes from government on household hygiene are available, promotional events targeting on Domestic helpers are scarce. Study looking into the needs of Domestic helpers on hygiene training was launched in spring 2017. Hand Hygiene (HH) was promoted at the same time. Four popular locations where Domestic helpers assembled were visited. Participants were invited to take a survey and perform HH. Samplings were done within 2 to 3 hours from noon. Collected samples were immediately chilled and processed within 24 hours. Written consent was obtained prior to collection. 38 sets (before and after) of HH samples and 95 copies of questionnaires were collected. Microbial load benchmarked with World Health organization (4 \u00d7 10 4 to 4.6 \u00d7 10 6 ). Methods: Hand juice method was used. Microbial tests included counts of total aerobic bacteria, yeast and mould, coliforms and Staphylococcus aureus. Ampicilin, Penicilin and Cefoxitin were used in the sensitivy tests on Staphylococcus aureus. Resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were confirmed by ChromIDTM MRSA agar. Results:",

Many articles show appropriate saliva secretion for the maintenance of oral hygiene and oral care through chlorhexidine mouthwashes or gels, which may help or reduce the risk of developing VAP. In June 1616, the self-protection unit of the hospital fully used Chlorhexidine gel to replace the original Chlorhexidine mouthwash, and with the clinical practice standard adjustment, expect to introduce a new care mode can reduce the VAP infection density and clinical care hours, improve the quality of medical care. Methods: Through the team's cooperation, in June 2016 to stay in the care unit patients that provide Chlorhexidine gel for oral care, through the new Chlorhexidine oral care time of about 15 minutes/ person, relative to Chlorhexidine mouthwash about 20 minutes/ person. Results: The infection density of respirator-associated pneumonia was 1.88\u2030 in the period from June to December in December, and the infection rate of respirator-associated pneumonia was 2.37\u2030 decreased by 20% compared with June-December 2015. In April, the density of respiration-related pneumonia infection was 1.23\u2030. Audiovisual compliance rates for clinical caregivers increased from 95% in 2015 to 99% in 2016. Conclusion: The use of patients with respirators in the care unit is one of the key care programs for the prevention of VAP. The results show that oral use with chlorhexidine gel for oral disinfection is not only 25% less than mouthwash, but also reduces respiration. The density of pneumonia and enhance the clinical care of oral care compliance, and effectively improve the quality of medical care.PS 216Increasing sexually transmitted diseases contributed by HIVinfected patients: ten-year experiences in Taoyuan General Hospital, Taiwan Pei-Hsin Tang, Wan-Ying Huang, Yi-Feng Chuang, Shiao-Chi Wang, Chien-Yu Cheng, Yi-Chun Lin, Shu-Hsing Cheng.

In March 2016, we observed a sharp increase in the incidence of MRSA in a neurosurgical ward. Infection Control Team, Neurosurgery Department and Central Nursing Division worked together and adopted a Logic Model approach to guide the implementation of MRSA reduction program. Logic Model is a management tool that can increase the potential of planning, implementing and evaluating programs to achieve the desired results. Methods: We developed a Logic Model to improve the implementation of MRSA reduction program in a neurosurgical ward. Firstly, the inputs required were identified as a well-established infection control infrastructure with clear lines of responsibilities, a dedicated infection control team, participation of all healthcare workers, and essential equipment. We then identified the critical activities: (1) \"Find & confine\" ensured MRSA carriers were quickly identified and cohorted. (2) \"Infection control practices\" minimized the opportunity of MRSA transmission. (3) \"Education and awareness building\" ensured appropriate and most updated infection control practices being carried out. (4) \"Monitoring with feedback mechanism\" allowed rapid assessment of performance which facilitated immediate rectification. Four Short-Term outcomes were identified: (i) increased awareness of MRSA transmission and infection control measures; (ii) improved staff engagement; (iii) improved staff compliance with infection control practices, and; (iv) reduced nosocomial MRSA transmission and colonization. The goals of our program (longterm outcome) were: continuous improvement in compliance infection control practices; internalization of infection control practices by healthcare workers, and ultimately; a reduction in nosocomial MRSA infection. Results: The program was implemented from April to September 2016. (1) 80% of healthcare workers in Neurosurgery Department joined educational talks. (2) >90% compliance in admission screening, cohort and decolonization.(3)Hand hygiene compliance rate increased from 95.5% to 98%. (4) The ward environment assessment by UV fluorescent marker showed 100% of audited sites cleaned. Positive MRSA environmental samples reduced from 95% to 20%. (5) Bi-weekly cross-ward hand hygiene compliance rate was 94%. All the results were shared with Neurosurgery Department on monthly basis. After six-month implementation, the incidence of nosocomial MRSA cases decreased from 1.4 per 1,000-patient-bed-days to 0.7 per 1,000patient-bed-days. Conclusion: Our success in reducing nosocomial MRSA in a neurosurgical ward highlighted Logic Models can be applied to complex, multifaceted infection control projects like MRSA reduction program. A longer term follow up should be done to confirm if the long-term outcome can be achieved.PS 226Experience sharing of using information systems to assist clinicians in the implementation of CAUTI bundle Chi-Fen Tsou 1 , Wan-Ping Tseng 1 , Ying-ling Chen 1 , Shu-Ling Chen 1 , Hsiao-Shan Chen 1 , Po-An Su 2 , Hung-jen Tang 1,2 . 1 Infection Control Committee, 2 Department of Internal Medicine, Infection division, Chi Mei Medical Center",

This suggest hypothesis such as defunct vanB + VRE, viable but nonculturable vanB + VRE, extremely low level of vanB + VRE, bacteria other than VRE harboring vanB. In this report, we isolated anaerobic microorganism, Clostridium innocuum, with vanB gene successfully first in Korea. Methods: Both vanA and vanB were detected from the fecal specimen by Seeplex \u00ae VRE ACE Detection PCR. Fecal specimen was incubated on enterococosel broth for 24 hours. Inoculation on PEBA with vancomycin disc was made and incubated in 5%CO2 for 24 hours. Fecal sample was inoculated on PE with vancomycin disc and incubated in anaerobic condition for 48 hours. Vancomycin resistant colonies were selected and identified using MALDI-TOF MS. PCR for vanA and vanB were tested using the colonies. Results: Direct PCR test with fecal sample showed both vanA and vanB positive. Vancomycin resistant E. faecium colony from aerobe culture showed vanA solely, not vanB. We performed the anaerobic culture, isolated and identified C. innocuum carrying vanB. C. innocuum showed typical vanB phenotype, vancomycin resistant and teicoplanin sensitive. Conclusion: PCR positive and culture negative vanB can be misled as false positive of PCR test unless cultured colony is proved. In this situation, anaerobes should be suspected especially vanB showed the discrepancy. It is not clear yet whether immediate isolation of patients with vanB positive other than VRE and precaution are required or not. Previous studies explained Atopobium minutum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Clostridium sp., Eggerthella lenta have Tn5382 and Tn1549 transposon including vanB gene. Tn1549 is able to move to other bacteria host if they have heterologous transfer system when plasmids or integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs).

Toxigenic C. difficile can colonize patients' intestinal tracts, then proliferate and produce toxins which can cause antibioticassociated diarrhea when intestinal normal flora is destroyed by antibiotic therapy. To investigate the prevalence and molecular characteristic of C. difficile in hospitalized patients with diarrhea we conducted this study. Methods: A total of 457 stool samples from hospitalized patients with diarrhea in a regional teaching hospital in central Taiwan were collected from July 2015 to January 2017. Stool samples were first inoculated into cycloserine-cefoxitin-mannitol broth with taurocholate lysozyme cysteine (CCMB-TAL) agar plate and incubated at 35-37\u00b0C for 7 days. After alcohol shock procedure, sediments of stool samples were inoculated in CHROMagar of C. difficile and performed anaerobic culture at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours. PCR method was used to detect the tpi, tcdA, tcdB, cdtA and cdtB genes of C. difficile. PCR ribotyping was used to genotype C. difficile isolates. Results: A total of 114 (24.9%) Clostridium difficile isolates were cultured. Among the 114 isolates, 58 (50.8%) isolates harbored both tcdA and tcdB genes. Three out of 58 toxigenic C. difficile isolates had both tcdC deletions and cdtAB. All 3 (3/58, 5.2%) tcdA+/tcdB+/cdtAB+ belonged to ribotype (RT) 127, and the remaining tcdA+/ tcdB +/cdtAB-isolates belonged to RT012 (12/58, 20.7%), RT014 (5/58, 8.6%), RT017 (2/58, 3.4%) and unknown ribotype (36/58, 62.0%). Other 56 (49.1%) isolates were non-toxigenic. Conclusion: In this study, 24.9% inpatient with diarrhea colonized with C. difficile. Half colonized C. difficile isolates were toxigenic and most toxigenic isolates were belonged to unknown ribotype and RT012. The prevalence of hypervirulent strains, such as RT017 or RT127, was very low. There is a need to further evaluate the importance of RT012 and unknown ribotype of C. difficile in antibiotic-associated diarrhea.PS 232Whole genome sequence of the Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum Strain Amoy: an Asia isolate is highly similar to SS14 Man-Li Tong, Xiao-Zhen Zhu, LI-Rong Lin, Tian-CiYang. Clinical  Laboratory, Zhongshan Hospital, Medical College of Xiamen  University, Xiamen, 361004, China    Background: Syphilis is the third leading epidemic diseases around the world and in China, affecting at least 25 million persons worldwide. Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum (T. pallidum) is the known pathogen for syphilis; however, not all the strains conduct severe infections in clinic. The question of what lead to such significant pathogenetic difference remains unexplored yet. With no doubt, decoding genome of T. pallidum provides a shortcut to unveil the difference. Up-to-date, 15 T. pallidum genomes were available; all of them are American origin that often co-infect patient with HIVs. Methods: In this study, we extracted the Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum Strain Amoy, a syphilis pathogen in Xiamen, China. Results: We sequenced its genome using the Illumina next generation sequencing technology, achieving a nearly (about 98.3%) complete genome of about 1.12 Mbps. The new genome shows good synteny with its five T. pallidum sibling strains (including Nichols, SS14, Mexico A, DAL-1, and Chicago), of which SS14 (CP004011.1) strain is the closest strain. This result is agreed with previous empirical researches that majority of infectious strains are SS14-like. Compared to these five known T. pallidum",

Section of Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Changhua Christian Hospital, TaiwanBackground: Elizabethkingia infection is associated with clinically significant mortality. E. anophelis was an emerging pathogen most related to Elizabethkingia-like bacteremia as reported in Hong Kong. Less information of infections related with E. anophelis had been reported in Taiwan. In addition, only E. meningoseptica is present in the database of most commercially available identification systems and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry. We hypothesized that misidentification of Elizabethkingia by such assays, though rarely mentioned, might exist, and should be assessed by the molecular identification. Methods: Two previously frozen isolates of E. meningoseptica, acquired in 2007 and 2015 respectively, were recruited at random. These two isolates were cultured respectively from blood of 95years-old male and sputum of 69-years-old male during admission. The Vitek 2 GNI system (V7.01 database) and the Vitek MS (V3.0 database) were first used to verify correctness of previous identification after recruitment. For confirmation, two kinds of 16S rRNA gene-based identification were performed with two different primer sets, one for limited sequencing targeting at the first 1,000 bp (CLSI guideline, MM18A) and the other one for entire sequencing (approximate 1.5 kb, Das S. et al, 2014). Bidirectional sequencing was conducted to ensure accuracy of sequencing. DNA sequences were compared to the GenBank database using the BLAST algorithm. The percent identity was interpreted for bacterial identification. Results: Both Vitek 2 and Vitek MS systems had reproducibly identified both isolates as E. meningoseptica with a good probability (99%) and confidence value (99.9), respectively. The limited 16S rRNA gene sequencing could not discriminate among E. anophelis, E. meningoseptica and E. endophytica in each isolate because of the same identity, 99.8% and 100%, respectively. Results of entire sequencing on both isolates shared highest sequence similarity of 99.8% and 100% with E. anophelis than those with E. meningoseptica. Conclusion: This preliminary study supported the hypothesis that misidentification of E. anophelis as E. meningoseptica did exist when using commercially available identification systems. Our results supported an evidence that some Elizabethkingia infection that had been attributed to E. meningoseptica were instead casused by E. anophelis. Full-length sequencing of the 16s rRNA gene is mandatory to correctly identify E. anophelis.PS 234Genotyping of Acinetobacter baumannii capsular polysaccharides by whole genome sequencing Yi-Tzu Lee 1,2 , Kory R.

Currently, only two antibiotics are available for the treatment of carbapenem resistant A. baumannii, colistin and tigecycline. However, both have limitations. These results indicate a necessity for other modality for the management of carbapenem resistant A. baumannii. Development of vaccine represents a new and innovative approach. Among the vaccine candidate, capsular polysaccharides (CPS) have been used successfully to prevent infection caused by many pathogens. The CPSs derived from different isolates might be composed of different sugars and/or linkages. These can give distinct capsular serotypes (K serotype). The result has an implication in vaccine development, as vaccine might be serotype specific. Methods: In this study, we aim to determine capsular types by whole genome sequencing-based capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) genotyping, using sequences analysis of the capsular genes cluster. The diversity and phylogenetic relatedness of A. baumannii clonal groups will be determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The clinical features and outcomes of patients who were infected with the corresponding A. baumannii isolates and their correlation with capsular types were investigated. Results: Among the 93 clinical isolates, 78 (83.9%) were typable using sequences analysis of the capsular genes cluster. The most common capsular type was KL2 (20/93, 21.5%), followed by KL3 (10/ 93, 10.8%), and KL49 (10/93, 10.8%). The capsular types highly correlated with MLST types. Conclusion: Distinct difference was observed among patient groups infected with isolates of different capsular genotype.PS 235Identification and antifungal susceptibility profiles of Candida nivariensis and Candida bracarensis in a multi-center Chinese collection of yeasts Xin Hou 1,2 , Ying Li 1,2 , Meng Xiao 1 , Sharon C.-A.

This study is to investigate whether H 2 O 2 can enhance PDT bactericidal effects. Methods: MRSA (ATCC BAA 1556) was treated with TBO-PDT with H 2 O 2 . Growth inhibition, biofilm formation and antibiotic susceptibility were studied. Results: Exposed MRSA to 100 J/cm 2 with 2.5 \u00b5g/mL TBO killed MRSA less than one log. In the presence of very low concentration of H 2 O 2 (<0.2%), bacterocidal effect was ehanced by 4 log (99.99%). Biofilm productions were inhibited by PDT and H 2 O 2 . Interestingly, the cells tended to be more sensitive to antibiotics after treatments. Conclusion: The results suggested H 2 O 2 may be potential in combination with TBO-PDT against MRSA.

We survey gonorrhea infection data from Centers for Disease Control, R.O.C. (Taiwan) website, it followed the same trend. Methods: In our laboratory identification of N. gonorrhoeae rests on the isolation of an oxidase-positive, Gram-negative diplococcus recovered from sample that grows on Thayer-Martin agar. N. gonorrhoeae are able to use Cystine trypticase agar medium (CTA) containing 1% dextrose. Detection of beta-lactamase to identify penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae strains by Cefinase disks. Because of there is too few cases/month, it is hard to do antibiotic sensitivity test with GC medium base agar. Results: From 2012 to April 2017, our laboratory reported gonorrhea cases from 17, 7, 13, 26, 29 to 14 cases/year. During the same time, Centers for Disease Control, R.O.C. (Taiwan) reported gonorrhea cases average from 54.7, 55.6, 55.7, 60.6, 76.2 to 97.2 cases/week. Gonorrhoeae cases in our hospital and Taiwan almost double in five years. Conclusion: With more and more gonorrhea cases, Laboratory should consider Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA to detect the infection quickly. And as antibiotic resistance increases, Laboratory should prepare GC medium base agar to confirm the antibiotic sensitivity test. If laboratory doing right, maybe we can reduce the gonorrhoeae infection.

One of the procedural factors is the suture used. Though Triclosan has been introduced since 1970s and as a suture coating in 2002 to reduce SSI, yet several studies have been published showing different results. We herein apply EBM approach to search and appraise the best integrated evidence to evaluate the effects of Triclosan-coated sutures (TCS) for the prevention of SSI. Methods: A PICO was formulated, and the keyword: (Triclosancoated sutures OR TCS) AND (surgical-site infection OR SSI) AND preventi* was used to search ClinicalKey, Cochrane Library and PubMed databases for literatures published in 3 years. In PubMed we filtered 5 relevant systematic review (SR). One 2017 published SR was selected in which Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was employed to assess the risk of random error, and quality of evidence was determined using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for appraisal (i.e., to assess validity, importance, and applicability of this systematically analyzed evidence). Results: The SR involves 21 RCTs, 6462 patients. Pooled effects showed a RR of 0\u22c572 (95%CI 0.60-0.86; P < 0\u22c5001). At a risk of 138 SSIs per 1000 procedures, the use of TCS reduced this by 39 (95%CI 19-55) and a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 25. The SR also performed subgroup analysis and meta-regression to explore the source of heterogeneity. In subgroup analysis of polydioxanone and CDC wound classification there was no significant effect on the prevention of SSI. Meta-regression showed no significant association between effect size and suture type (P = 0\u22c541) or contamination (P = 0\u22c571). Conclusion: GRADE assessment shows moderate-quality evidence that TCS are effective in reducing SSI. Trial sequential analysis indicates that the effect was robust, and additional data are unlikely to alter the summary effect. WHO recommended in new \"Global Guidelines for the Prevention of Surgical Site Infections\" on Nov. 4, 2016 that the use of triclosan-coated sutures is supported by WHO for the purpose of reducing the risk of surgical site infection (SSI), independent of the type of surgery, which consistent with the evidence appraised in current article.PS 453Early removal of the catheter to reduce the catheter associated urinary tract infection Yu-Shan Chien 1 , YU-Ping Wu 1 , Wan-Yi Lin 1 , Chia-Yun Pan 2 , Chiu-yuch Yea 1 , Ching-Wen Chang 1 . 1 Department of Nursing, Taipei Veterans General Hospital Yuanshan & Su-Ao Branch, 2 Department of Infection Control, Taipei Veterans General Hospital Yuanshan & Su-Ao Branch Background: The catheter associated urinary tract infection is one of the common problems in medical care.

From July 2013, indicators of medical device-related infections began to routinely be reported to the Taiwan Clinical Performance Indicator (TCPI), then we had the chance to compare other peers' medical centers with the reported data. The first few months of the reported data were analyzed and found quite unstable, CAUTI weighted average of RCC was 7.25\u2030 in 2013, while 5.84\u2030 in 2014. The result is far higher than other medical centers. During the years 2015\u223c2017, it was the period our hospital to join \"invasive medical treatment care quality improvement project\" of Taiwan CDC. Of course, RCC is the inevitable participation unit involved in the project, Methods: CAUTI Bundle care basically has hand hygiene, sterile technology into the catheter, maintain a closed and smooth drainage system, and to assess the necessity of indwelling. The goal of quality control methods is to find out the unexecuted items. RCC in the master project are hand hygiene, sterile technology into the catheter and urethra cleaning. To develop a strategy to solve the problems: Firstly, the key steps of catheter placement are: (1) the use of sterile towel to increase the range of sterile surface: the original sterile surface was 49.5 cm*49.5 cm and was expanded and increased to 140 cm*105 cm.(2)Single preparation is changed to the double preparation operation. Secondly, hand hygiene recertification. Thirdiy, the patient bedside with a flushing bottle, it is to change the patient after the stool from dry care to wet carerinsing. Results: RCC's Quality control team was established and operated since March 2015. The improvement strategy was implemented in September 2015, CAUTI data was improved from 6.1\u2030 (2014.1 \u223c 2015.2) to 5.4\u2030 (2015.[3][4][5][6][7][8], and was further more reduced to 2.75\u2030 (2015.9 \u223c 2016.3), which even 5 months of CAUTI data showed zero infection. In addition, at the same time also accidentally found that the central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) has been reduced from 10.5\u2030 (2014.1 \u223c 2015.2) to 6.7\u2030 (2015.9 \u223c 2016.3). Conclusion: We found that prevention of medical device-related infection will return to the fundamentals of the problem which are the implementation of hand hygiene and sterile technology. This explained that when we improve the CAUTI problem, the associated CLABSI indicators also see the progress.PS 468 Predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteriuria Chien Chuang 1 , Chin-Fang Su 1 , Yi-Tsung Lin 2,3 , Fu-Der Wang 2 , Yin-Ching Chuang 4 , L.

Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical and microbiological data of patients with monomicrobial CRKP bacteriuria from 16 hospitals in Taiwan during 2013 to 2014. Carbapenem resistance was defined as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of \u22652 mg/L for imipenem or meropenem. The resistance mechanisms were analyzed. Critically ill patients were those with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score \u2265 20. Tigecycline was considered as inappropriate therapy regardless of MIC due to low urine concentration. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine independent risk factors of 14-day and 28-day mortality. Subgroup analysis for critically ill and noncritically ill patients were performed. Results: Of the 126 hospitalized patients with CRKP bacteriuria, 53 had genes that encoded carbapenemase: KPC-2 (n = 43), KPC-17 (n = 7), VIM-1 (n = 1), IMP-8 (n = 1) and OXA-48 (n = 1). The 14-day and 28-day mortality were 12.7% and 23.0%, respectively. Critically ill patients (n = 53, 42.1%) had significantly higher mortality to noncritically ill patients. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy was used in 33 patients (26.2%). In the multivariate Cox analysis, APACHI II score was the only independent risk factor for 14-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.22; P < 0.001).

The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and prognosis of BSI in heart transplant recipients at our hospital. Methods: The study is a retrospective chart review. We studied 39 consecutive HT performed at our institution between 2008 and 2014. Results: We diagnosed 19 episodes of BSI in 15 out of 39 heart transplant patients (38.5%) during the 8-year study period. BSI occurred at a median of 44 days (range 5-1998) after transplant and 78.9% occurred within 6 months after transplant. Most BSI episodes were occurring within 2-6 months (47.8%) transplant and. As far as pathogen was concerned, Gram-negative bacteria predominated (78.3%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (13%), fungus (8.7%). Conclusion: Reduction of postoperative within 6 months complications and viral infections are amenable goals thatmay further reduce BSI in this population. PS 471 Improving the correctness of bundle intervention for ventilator associated pneumonia in intensive care unit Tzu-Yin Liu, Wan-Yin Hsu, Tun-chieh Chen. Kaohsiung Municipal Ta-Tung HospitalBackground: The average ventilator associated pneumonia rate was 1.01\u2030 in our intensive care unit in 2015. Through the observation and audit on the clinical practice of care procedures for endotracehal tube, we found several steps against the evidenced based care bundle. First, the head of the bed was not reached 30-45\u00b0; Second, the concentration of chlorhexidine for oral hygiene care was lower than the recommend level of at least 0.12%; Third, the compliance of daily sedation vacations and assessment of readiness to extubate were also not adequate. The overall correctness was only 49.4%. Once the patient developing ventilator associated pneumonia, the length of stay, antibiotics consumption and medical costs will increase and may cause patient mortality. Methods: (1) Make a marker for indicating 30\u00b0of the head of the bed.(2)Hold the educational course for the oral hygiene care.(3)Establish the standard operating procedure for daily sedation vacation. (4) Implement the computer information system to remind the compliance. (5) Make a daily assessment board for invasive medical procedures. (6) Tape a educational video for preventing ventilator associated pneumonia.(7)Introduce scenario simulation teaching. (8) Apply \"team resource management\" and interdisciplinary model to remind the daily assessment for readiness to extubate. Results: We started the improvement measures since March 2016. The correctness and compliance of bundle intervention for ventilator associated pneumonia were 100% during April and September, 2016. The additional benefit was the ventilator associated pneumonia rate was 0.21\u2030 during January and September, 2016. There was only one episode of ventilator associated pneumonia. Conclusion: Through the interdisciplinary cooperation, effective communications, brain storming, we introduced creative intervention on care bundle for ventilator associated pneumonia which can improve the correctness and compliance of bundle intervention for ventilator associated pneumonia in intensive care unit and also can reduce the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia. These enhance the quality of care, infection control ability and reinforce the confidence and appreciation of family to clinical nursing staffs.PS 472 Infection control of the operation room renovationYing-Ling Chen, Shu-Ling Chen, Hung-Jen Tang.

Potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs) are frequent. Data regarding potential drugdrug interactions in HIV-positive individuals in Thailand is limited. Methods: A retrospective study of HIV patients treated at the infectious clinic of Vajira hospital. PDDIs screened by using the Liverpool drug interactions database. Defined as Red flag interaction (contraindicated, avoid or not recommended) and orange flag interaction (caution, or close monitoring, or capable of causing clinical deterioration). Results: Of 1,320 patients were included, 711 (53.8%) were male and mean age was 44 \u00b1 9 years. Median CD4 was 495 cells/mm 3 (11-1,657). Of all, 14 (1.06%) had tuberculosis coinfection. Overall 79.6% and 20.4% of patients received NNRTI-based regimens and PI, respectively. Nevirapine is the most common used NNRTI (62%) while Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is the most common used in PI (74%). A total of 533 patients in 1,321 HIV patients (40.35%) were at risk for a PDDI. Red flag interaction had 1.81% (12/664 events) and orange flag interaction 98.19% (652/664 events). Major interactions most frequently involved rifampicin in red flag interaction and statin in orange flag interaction. In the multivariate analysis, factors associated with having PDDIs were male (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.01-1.68), advanced age (age \u2265 50 years) (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.63-2.95), 2 comedications (OR 13.56, 95% CI 8.53-21.55), \u22653 comedications (OR 41.07, 95% CI 12.68-133.06) and tuberculosis coinfection (OR 44.02, 95% CI 2.62-739.47) respectively. Multivariated logistic regression of risk for PDDIs Conclusion: The prevalence of the PDDIs is high among HIVinfected adult on ARV drugs in Vajira Hospital.

A molecular surveillance of genotypic drug resistance testing for HIV-1 was conducted for patients with virologic failure during the past five years to investigate the trend and pattern of prevalence to drug resistance in our hospital. Methods: 4 classes of antiviral agents are available nowadays in Taiwan for treatment: protease inhibitor(PIs), non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors(nNRTIs), nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors(NRTIs) and integrase inhibitor(INSTIs). Individuals was defined as treatment failure if follow-up plasma viral load did not reach one of the criteria: up to 2 log 10 copies/mL decrease after 1-month therapy; undetectable or under 20 copies/ mL after 6-month therapy. Drug resistance testing, based on WHO standard, was restricted to those patients experiencing virologic failure. Genotypic drug resistance mutations were analyzed using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database, and the results were compared with the data published by Taiwan Background: H. pylori infection is associated with gastrointestinal disorders in the human population worldwide. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a ubiquitous nuclear protein, mediates a variety of inflammatory functions. The interaction between HMGB1 and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) triggers nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB expression, which in turn stimulates the release of proinflammatory cytokines. However, how H. pylori activates HMGB1 expression to regulate autophagy pathway in gastric epithelial cells in response to inflammation has not been explored.Methods: The role of HMGB1 during H. pylori infection of gastric epithelial cells was analyzed by using biochemistry approaches. Western blot and confocal microscopy analyses were used to investigate whether cholesterol-rich microdomains are involved in the induction of HMGB1 and RAGE expression and the subsequent inflammatory response. (2013) (2014) . According to the effect on tuberculosis to death, the causes of death were classified into three categories: \"tuberculosis cause death,\" \"non-tuberculosis cause death\" and \"unknown.\" To judge the reason for patients who are still on treatment after 12 months using the post notification questionnaires and the DOTS (directly observed therapy, shortcourse) diary records. Results: Among the 25 patients included, the total treatment success rate was 61.1% failing to achieve the tuberculosis control target (85%). The low successful treatment rate was partly due to high fatality rate (16.0%). Further analyzes the relation between tuberculosis and death, we find that only 22.2% belong to \"tuberculosis cause death\" and the proportion has dropped along with the age rise. Most of the patients belong to \"non-tuberculosis cause death\" were following suffer from malignant tumor, renal failure, diabetes and hypertension. In our study cohort there were two patients who were still on treatment after 12 months. The reason can divide into having drug resistance (50%), and comorbidity (50%). Of the two patients two has completed treatment in Dec 2013. If we regard the patients who belong to \"non-tuberculosis cause death\" and \"still on treatment\" as successful treatment, then the treatment success rate will achieve 72.2%. Conclusion: This is the first report of the cohort review methodology being applied to a public healthy population. Using the World Health Organization standard monitor way can not be objective evaluation of treatment outcome for patients with tuberculosis in Taichung city. We should establish a suitable monitoring guideline of tuberculosis according to the epidemiological pattern of tuberculosis in Taiwan.

Showing the general physical examination mining IgM screening method has a high false positive rate of the problem. This study is to explore low-cost screening method, reduce the occurrence of pseudo-positive and waste of medical resources to reduce the risk of hepatitis A epidemic. Methods: Because acute hepatitis A is diagnosed with IgM-positive and IgG-negative conditions to exclude past infections, IgMpositive patients are informed that there is a problem with false positives. In order to improve the problem, some health clinics even explicitly require both to be tested at the same time to increase the positive rate, but this will result in a significant increase in the cost of screening.

Methods: This is a 21-year-old man who was a part-time worker on Daylily mountain. He was admitted for intermittent fevers to 40\u00b0C for one week. The patient was doing well until one week prior to admission when he started to have intermittent fevers accompanied by headache and abdominal pain. Also, there is a painless ulcer at glans penis ( Figure 1 ) along with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Four days prior to admission, non-pruritic papular skin rashes spread from face to trunk then proximal limbs. He denied sexual contact in recent one year. Due to concern for syphilis and scrub typhus infection, he was admitted for oral minocycline and levofloxacin treatment. Results: The patient had thrombocytopenia (94\u00d7103/\u03bcL) and elevated liver enzyme (AST: 182 IU/L, ALT: 141 IU/L). However, after four days of antibiotics, the patient was still febrile and suffering from headache. Brain CT was not remarkable. Lumbar puncture revealed clear colorless fluid with lymphocyte predominant (71%), total protein was 114.9 mg/dL, and glucose was 61 mg/dL. RPR was non-reactive and specific treponemal antibody test was also negative. In contrast, Orientia Tsutsugamushi IgM and IgG were positive. After seven days of levofloxacin treatment, the ulcer had almost healed. Therefore, the final diagnosis was scrub typhus infection. Conclusion: To our knowledge, an eschar from scrub typhus infection presenting as penile ulcer has never been previously reported. However, painless genital ulcer may mislead clinicians to consider STD at first. As clinicians in an area with high prevalence of scrub typhus, we must recognize the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment. Background: Relative bradycardia has been reported in many infectious diseases, including dengue fever. Here we report a dengue related sinus bradycardia in a 40-year-old woman.Methods: This 40-year-old female HBV carrier, a second-hand goods business woman, presented to our hospital with chief complaints of fever and chills for 2 days. She lived in Hualien but had been to Kaohsiung for a one-day trip with her husband during a dengue epidemic in 2015. Three days after coming home, she had a sudden onset of fever and chills, accompanied with general soreness, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, cough, and low back pain. She came to the emergency room. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, pulse rate 91 beat/min, respiratory rate 17 breath/min, and blood pressure 126/68 mmHg. Physical examination showed several pruritic and warm erythematous maculopapules with excoriation scattering on her right arm. Laboratory tests revealed thrombocytopenia of 124,000/uL, otherwise normal. Influenza A/B antigen, and initial dengue IgM and IgG were all negative. She complained of persistent low back pain at the emergency room, and was then admitted to the Infectious Disease service for further management. Results: Two days after admission, she had a fever again, and the body temperature was 38\u00b0C. Laboratory tests revealed white blood cell count of 1,330/uL, CRP 0.43 mg/dL, and platelet 57,000/uL. Pneumococcus antigen and Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM were negative. She had chest distress, and bradycardia, ranging from 40 to 60 beat/min, was noted on hospital day 3. Holter monitor showed sinus rhythm with ventricular rate 38 to 104 beat/min (mean: 55 beat/min). One week after admission, blood culture report showed no growth. However, liver dysfunction was noted, with AST and ALT elevated to 109 and 108 IU/L, respectively. Other laboratory tests revealed HBV DNA(Q): 187 IU/mL, HBs Ag (+): 173.10 IU/mL, HBe Ag: negative, HBc IgM: negative. The biphasic fever pattern was consistent with so-called camelback fever pattern. Re-check Dengue NS1 Ag with real-time PCR on hospital day 9 was positive. The patient improved much after supportive care, and the liver function index, fever, and bradycardia were relieved as well. She was discharged uneventfully. Conclusion: Dengue can cause bradycardia, which could be symptomatic but rarely life-threatening, often ignored by most doctors or nurses.",

National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center Infection Control Division Background: \"WHO Position papers -Immunization of Health Care Workers (HCWs)\" says All HCWs should be immunized with measles and documentation of immunization or vaccination should be required as a condition of registration for training and employment. Hospital N, the core of regional medical care, inspected all employees for measles antibodies in 2012 and has since inspected new officials. However, many staff had measles immunization record only one. Secondary vaccine failure (SVF) (initially a suitable response is seen and the immune system decreases over time) is said to occur in a few percent of vaccinated people. Therefore, we investigated whether staff's measles immunity had declined within 5 years. Methods: Since 2012, at the N hospital, measles antibodies tested all officials using the gelatin particle aggregation (PA) assay (test 1). If the PA value was less than 258 (less than measles immunity standard) (LMI), they were able to receive measles rubella (MR) vaccine without cost burden. Next, in December 2016, measles antibodies of people who received test 1 were also examined (test clinical CRF07_BC isolates reveals natural deletions of Gag p6. We previously proved that galectin3 (Gal3) promotes HIV1 NL43 budding through associating with Alix and Gag p6. The purpose of this study isto analyze the potential regulatory function of Gal3 in HIV1 CRF07_BC infections. Methods: HIV1 CRF07_BC infectious clones were constructed, which contains 7 and 11 a.a. deletions (7d and11d) plus a repaired form in the Gag p6 domain. Infectivity assays, replication kinetics, and immunoblotting were used to evaluate the regulating effects of Gal3 on CRF07_BC virus replication and budding. Immunofluorescent staining, super resolution analyses and Membrane flotation were used to measure Gal3 colocalization with Alix or Gag7d and Gag11d and cofractionation patterns. Coimmunoprecipitation(CoIP) assays were used to evaluate interactions between Alix and Gag p6 truncated form in expression or knockdown Gal3 CD4+ T cells. Results: Data from cotransfections of pCRF07_BC and pGal3 vectors into 293T cells indicate that Gal3 expression resulted in a slight increase in CRF07_BC viral budding and slower replication kinetics compared to the NL43 strain. This phenomenon could be compensated when repairing a.a. deletions in the 07_BCp6 domain. Immunofluorescent staining and super resolution analyses indicate Gal3 expression slightly enhanced this colocalization to 30-40%\u037e a significant increase (60-70%) was noted when Alix was colocalized with repaired 07BCGag ( p < 0.01). Membrane flotation data indicate that (a) Alix, Gag7d or11d, and flotinin1 (a lipid raft marker) exhibited reduced cofractionation toward cell membranes, and Gal3 expression slightly increased the cofractionation of these proteins. CoIP data indicate that IP Alix and Gag7d or 11d pulled down smaller amounts of down Gag7d or 11d and Alix respectively, while IP Alix and repaired 07BCGag pulled significantly larger amounts of repaired 07BCGag and Alix in the presence of Gal3 ( p < 0.05). We also detected higher concentrations of Gal3 in sera collected from patients infected with HIV1 subtype B compared to patients infected with CRF07_BC. Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of natural polymorphism in the Gag6 domain of HIV1 CRF07_BC strains and its impacts on Gal3 regulatory function and slow disease progression.Conclusion: HPeVs are detected early in life, 45% are associated with symptoms. Most healthy children have had at least 1 HPeV infection by their 2 nd birthday. HPeVs shedding duration can last many weeks. Various genotypes ( predominantly HPeV-1) cocirculate in the community, contributing to multiple episodes in individuals.",

Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, TaiwanBackground: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a neurotropic flavivirus, annually causes over 30,000 JE cases in East and Southeast Asia. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate lysine acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins, regulating many processes including inflammation and antiviral immune response. This study investigated antiviral activity of pan-and selective-HDAC inhibitors as host-targeting agents against JEV. Methods: Antiviral activity of pan-and selective-HDAC inhibitors was evaluated by their inhibitory effect on JEV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and apoptosis, virus yields in cultured supernatants, and intracellular virus titers. Antiviral mechanism(s) of HDAC inhibitors was determined using attachment, time-of-addition, and viral RNA synthesis assays. Results: Among HDAC inhibitors, selective HDAC6 inhibitors (tubastatin-A (TBSA) and tubacin) concentration-dependently inhibited JEV-induced cytopathic effect and apoptosis, as well as reduced virus yield in human cerebellar medulloblastoma cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of virus yield was 0.26 \u03bcM for tubacin and 1.75 \u03bcM for TBSA, respectively. Tubacin (IC50 of 1.52 \u03bcM), but not TBSA, meaningfully blocked the production of intracellular infectious virus particles. In time-ofaddition assays, the greatest potency of antiviral activity was observed in the mode of pre-treatment with tubacin (IC50 of 1.89 \u03bcM) compared to simultaneous (IC50 of 4.88 \u03bcM) and posttreatment (IC50 of 2.05 \u03bcM) modes. Interestingly, tubacin induced the hyperacetylation of a HDAC6 substrate Hsp90 and reduced the interaction of Hsp90 with JEV NS5 protein. Novobiocin, an Hsp90 inhibitor, diminished the NS5 protein amount and virus replication in JEV-infected cells. Meantime, tubacin suppressed the NS5 expression and antisense RNA genome synthesis in infected cells. Tubacin-induced Hsp90 hyperacetylation was suggested to influence the NS5 activity in JEV replication. Conclusion: Tubacin had high potential of a host-targeting agent against JEV, exhibiting preventive and therapeutic activities against JEV infection. Background: Severe dengue is characterized by aberrant immunologic over-activation and cytokine production. Chronic kidney disease was an epidemiologically identified risk factor for development of severe dengue in dengue-affected patients. However, the immunologic responses of patient with chronic kidney disease when suffering from dengue virus (DENV) infection have not been fully understood. Methods: We performed an in vitro study evaluating the sequential immunological reactions in the DENV-2 infected mononuclear cells of patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) under hemodialysis (n = 34) (ESRD group) and healthy adults (control group) (n = 30). The concentrations of interleukin [IL]-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)\u3001 monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1b (MIP-1b), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) in the supernatants from the infected mononuclear cells were measured at 6h, 24h, 48h and 72h, respectively. Results: Among the ESRD participants, hypertension (61.7%) was the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes mellitus (41.2%). At 6h after DENV-2 infection, the concentration of GM-CSF in ESRD group was significantly higher than that in the control group. However, the ESRD group had significantly lower GM-CSF\u3001 IL-1Ra, IL-6, TNF-a, VEGF and IL-12p70 levels than those of the control group at 48 h after DENV-2 infection. In addition, significantly lower levels of IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, MCP-1 and MIP-1b were detected in the ESRD group compared to control group at 6h, 24h, 48h and 72h, respectively, after DENV-2 infection. Conclusion: The role of chemo-cytokines in the subsequent development of severe dengue in ESRD patients remains uncertain.",

Cirrhosis is almost derived from chronic hepatitis. However, the status of HHV-8 infection in patients with chronic hepatitis remains unclear. Methods: Blood samples from 129 patients with chronic hepatitis and from 129 age-matched healthy controls were collected and analyzed for monocyte and platelet counts, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), HHV-8 antibody and DNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Results: Mean monocyte and platelet counts were significantly higher and lower in patients with chronic hepatitis than in healthy controls (P = 0.021 and <0.0001, respectively). Seropositive rate for HHV-8 antibodies was significantly greater in patients (32.6%) than in controls (20.9%, P = 0.035), particularly in patients with HCV infection, or higher plasma ALT levels, or both (P = 0.004, 0.011, and 0.0009, respectively). The mean age of HHV-8 seropositive patients (60.3 years) was significantly older than that of seronegative patients (52.3 years) (P = 0.0009). Antibody titers for HHV-8 in patients also exceeded those in controls (P = 0.018). Conclusion: A significantly high HHV-8 seroprevalence is already present in patients with chronic hepatitis before the development of cirrhosis, particularly in patients with HCV infection, or higher plasma ALT levels, or both. Advancing age seems to play an important role in HHV-8 seroprevalence in patient with chronic hepatitis.Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG 1:40 (+), and CMV pp67 PCR (+). Whole body Gallium scan showed increased uptake of lymph nodes at bilateral neck, mediastinum, axillary, and inguinal regions. Malignant lymphoma was highly suspected. Owing to the acute retroviral syndrome with negative results of HIV infection and suspected malignant lymphoma, we considered the possibility of acute HTLV-1 infection. We rechecked HTLV-1 Ab and it was positive. Flow cytometry showed around 4.8% aberrant ATLL cells. Inguinal lymph node biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of ATLL (Figure 1) . Later, the blood bank confirmed the blood sample taken 4 years ago was infected with HTLV-1. She had VCAP-AMP-VECP with zidovudine chemotherapy, and had a complication of port-A venous thrombosis. Conclusion: We present a case of HTLV-1 related ATLL. HTLV-1 infection is routinely tested for blood donation in Taiwan. While most infected people remain asymptomatic, HTLV-1 may lead to malignant lymphoma and other opportunistic infections. In addition, we often treat malignant lymphoma but ignore its association with other leading causes.",

Background: Enterovirus type 71 (EV71) causes many diseases ranging from mild to severe neurological symptoms. Unfortunately, there is still no effective medicine against EV71 for clinical use. In previous study, hot crude extract of Perilla frutescens possess anti-EV71 activity. In this study, we tried to assay the cytotoxicity and anti-viral actitivity of different fractions of P. frutescens. Methods: In order to confirm which compound(s) with antiviral activity against EV71, separation of the crude extract by ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with fraction collector was carried out. After antiviral activity test, the expected components in the fraction extract were analyzed by UPLC-Q/TOF to identify the exact molecular weight for further chemical formula search. Results: Due to complex mixture of hot crude extract of Perilla frutescens, it is difficult to gain the useful information of compound (s) with antiviral activity against EV71.

Background: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL76 protein and its related protein family UL24_Herpes target to nucleolus at the late phase of viral infection. In several animal modeling systems for herpesvirus infection, it is demonstrated that members of UL24_Herpes are the pathogenic determinants which exacerbate disease progression by enhancing the efficiency of viral reactivation from latency. We demonstrated that UL76 interacts with subunits of ubiquitin-proteasome system, resulting in the sequestration of polyubiquitinated proteins and the relocation of proteasome subunits into nucleolus. We hypothesized that UL76 interacts with nucleolar proteins and modulates the ultrastructure of nucleolus. Methods: The interactions of UL76 and nucleolar proteins were assessed by the following experiments: immunocoprecipitation assay, immunofluorescence cell staining and imaging techniques, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. These experiments were performed both in the HCMV-infected cells and in the transient expression of DNA co-transfected cell system. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay was performed to assess the nucleolar protein kinetic profiles in the presence of UL76. Results: Several lines of evidence consistently support that UL76 interacts with nucleolar major nucleolar protein NPM1. UL76 and NPM1 are in a protein complex. UL76 localizes in close proximity with NPM1 protein. UL76 affects the diffusion kinetics of NPM1. Conclusion: Our results elucidate a common and fundamental mechanism that UL76, likely UL24_herpes protein family, modulates nucleolar ultrastructure.",

Methods: This study used retrospective methods to collect medical records for data analysis. The target population was patients with ventilators using endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy within bundle care at an intensive care unit in a regional hospital between April, 2015 and September, 2016. Results: There were total of 242 patients with ventilators using endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy at an intensive care unit in a regional hospital between April, 2015 and September, 2016. Male patients accounted for 62.4% while patients with age 65 or above accounted for 61.2%. The medium administration period was 4 days (1\u223c61 days). The infection size was 2 persons while total ventilator user-days were 2418 person-days. As a result, the average VAP infection rate was 0.78\u2030. Conclusion: After introducing bundle care for VAP prevention in 2015, the VAP infection rate between April, 2015 and September, 2016 was 0.78\u2030, which was lower than the average rate (1.22\u2030) of other hospitals with the same Taiwan Clinical Performance Indicator. The introduction of bundle care was successful under the full supports of the management and the full participation of the entire team. Results: Within the whole population, the leading pathogens associated with CLABSIs were gram-negative bacteria (GNB, 59.3%), followed by gram-positive bacteria (24.8%), and fungi (23.4%). Acinetobacter spp, Enterobacter spp, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were the most frequently isolated. There was an increase of Vancomycin-resistant strain (all were Enterococcus faecium), which was of statistically significance ( p = 0.028), but no significant time trend identified in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (3.5% vs 2.3%, p = 0.553), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) (7.1% vs 5.0%, p = 0.506), and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) (1.8% vs 1.6%, p = 1.000). Markedly reduced episodes of mixed infection (12.4% vs. 5.0%, p = 0.010) was noticed post bundle implementation. Via univariate analysis, patients those had older age (\u226565 years old), cardiovascular disease, renal disease, malignancy, ICU admission mainly for respiratory disease or sepsis, catheter placement in internal jugular vein, inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy, infected by fungi, or resistant strains were more likely to expire within 14 days (all p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, malignancy, inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy, inadequate definite antimicrobial therapy, and infection by fungi or multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) were associated with 14-day mortality (all p < 0.05, table 1). The CLABSI incidence rate decreased from 5.54 to 2.18 per 1,000 catheter-day (from 2014 to 2015) which disclosed the effectiveness of insertion and maintenance bundles, and the importance of its compliance (figure 1). Conclusion: We identified Gram-negative bacteria as leading pathogens of CLABSIs in a Taiwan medical center. Malignancy, infection by MDROs or fungi, inadequate empirical or definite antimicrobial therapy are significant factors for 14-day mortality. Among monitored items of the care bundle, the complicance of maximal sterile barrier precaution (54.6% to 74.6%) during catheter insertion could be a key componenet.

To improve quality of care and to reduce CAUTI rate, our hospital began to take part in the CAUTI-Bundle Care plan since January 2017. At the beginning of this plan, it was found that nursing staff do not understand the purpose of this plan and the correct procedures of the Foley catheter insertion and care. The aim of this study is to use systemic strategies to educate the nursing staffs about proper manipulation during catheterization and daily care, which would further promote the quality of nursing care and could reduce the CAUTI rate. Methods: This study was initiated in a local community hospital since March to June 2017 according to the procedures. To increase the correct rate of CAUTI bundle care implementation, several Background: To investigate the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of major pathogens that causing nosocomial infections in China, 2016. Methods: A total of 1897 non-duplicated nosocomial cases as well as pathogens causing bloodstream infections (BSI), hospitalacquired pneumonia (HAP) and intra-abdominal infections (IAI) from 12 teaching hospital around China were collected. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the agar dilution method, except tigecycline was determined by the broth microdilution method. Results: Of all cases, 829 cases (43.7%) were from BSI, 565 (29.8%) from HAP and 503 (26.5%) from IAI. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most prevalent pathogens causing BSI (31.2% and 14.2% respectively) and IAI (31.6% and 13.9% respectively), while Acinetobacter baumanii (27.8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.6%) were dominated in HAP. Tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem exhibited high potency against Enterobacteriaceae and the susceptibilities rates were 93.6%, 93.9% and 94.3% respectively. Enterobacteriaceae demonstrated high resistance against ceftriaxone (51.4%) and cefotaxime (51.9%), followed by fluoroquinolones (39.1-42.2%). \u03b2-lactam+inhibitor showed high antibacterial activity against Enterobacteriaceae with susceptible rate 89.3% ( piperacillin/tazobactam) and 83.3% (cefoperazone/ sulbactam). Acinetobacter baumanii showed low susceptibilities to the microbial agents except for tigecycline (86.6%). The rate of carbapenem resistant A. baumanii (CRAB) was 80.2%. Amikacin, cefiazidime, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam showed high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa with susceptible rate 90.9%, 74.7%, 73.8% and 70.1% respectively. The resistant rate to imipenem and meropenem were 30.5% and 22.6% in P. aeruginosa. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to linezolid, daptomycin and glycopeptides. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 37.3% of all the S. aureus. No Enterococcus strains were found resistant to tigecycline, linezolid and daptomycin. Vacomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE) was found in Enterococcus faecium, accounting for 1.6% of all E. faecium strains. Conclusion: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa are the most common pathogens causing nosocomial infections.Nosocomial pathogens showed high susceptibilities against tigecycline. Vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid exhibit high potency to S. aureus and Enterococcus. Carbapenems remain high susceptibility against Enterobacteriaceae, however the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has increased, which should be monitored continuously in China.",

Background: To understand the possibility of that the MALDI-TOF MS applied on the vancomycin susceptibility detection of enterococci, this study performed the proteomics analysis for detecting the changes of proteins during the bacterial death of enterococci. Methods: The vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was treated either with or without vancomycin (6 ug/ml) for 1 hour. The bacterial death was confirmed with colony count and LIVE/ DEAD dual fluorescent stain. Then the whole bacterial proteins were extracted and separated with two-dimension-polyacrylamide-gel-electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and then the changes of proteins were analyzed. The interested changes in the protein spots were picked and subjected to perform the LC-MS/MS for examining the protein spots. Results: The result shown in colony count and dual fluorescent stain indicated that the Enterococcus faecalis treated with vancomycin for 1 hour caused bacterial death. Therefore, the proteins collected in the process of bacterial death were examined at 1 hour. Nine identified proteins were observed to be increase during the process of bacterial death. They were triggger factor, phenylalanine-tRNA ligase alpha subunit, 30S ribosomal protein S2, DnaK, 50S ribosomal protein L2, 50S ribosomal protein L1, uracil phosphoribosyl transferase, 30S ribosomal protein S4, and 50S ribosomal protein L10, respectivly. Conclusion: The vancomycin caused bacterial death in Enterococcus faecalis has been detected at 1 hour. The proteins induced during the bacterial death have been analyzed and 9 identified proteins could be applied as the protein markers during the bacterial death. This finding is contributed to help us in the early differentiation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci.",

Chi Mei Medical Center, Intensive Care Medicine, Yongkang, TaiwanIntroduction: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) affect multiple organ systems. Brain involvement commonly causes seizures, central nervous systemic (CNS) lupus may occur without systemic SLE activity, often leading to a delayed diagnosis. We discuss the case of SLE and presenting with an atypical movement disorder and partial continuous epilepsy. Case Reports: The 37 years old male patient with the past history paroxysms of altered consciousness with stupor, reduced awareness and poor responses nearly one hour and over eight times within half year suspect seizure was regular followed up at our neurological department. This time, he suffered from fever up to 39 degree, altered metal status and falling down episode and seizure was told at that time. He became stupor, general weakness and consciousness change. After admission, intravenous ceftriaxone was used for suspicious of meningitis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed suspicious of CNS lupus, electroencephalography (EEG) and lumbar puncture were done. Solu-medrol for pulse therapy was performed. However, progressive lower limbs weakness was noted. Then, cervical to thoracic spine MRI was done and C2-C6 spine cord edema was noted. So Cyclophosphamide was administered and steroid was kept for further treatment. Due to CNS infection couldn't be ruled out, we maintain antibiotics with ceftriaxone for ten days. However due to progressive weakness, and deteriorated consciousness, Double filtration plasmapheresis was performed and after treatment, his conscious and muscle power were improving and could answer simple questions. He was discharged and rheumatology OPD follow up was arranged. Discussion: Seizures often complicate systemic autoimmune disorders through a variety of mechanisms. Understanding the pathophysiology of epileptogenesis in these patients may help provide therapeutic targets for specific patients. Also, MRI and laboratory findings, including CSF analysis are rarely specific. Only a combination of several diagnostic procedures, additional specific serological tests, and, if possible, stereotactic brain biopsy may ensure a firm diagnosis.",

            "text": "Tamarixetin exerts anti-inflammatory activity and prevents bacterial sepsis by increasing IL-10 production Su Jin Lee, Seung Jun Lee, Yeong-Min Park, In Duk Jung. Department of Immunology, Lab of Dendritic Cell Differentiation & Regulation, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Chungju, 380-701, South Korea Background: Sepsis causes systemic inflammatory response due to pathogenic infection. Currently, sepsis treatment depends on antibiotics without specific drugs. Dysregulated host immune defense system against pathogenic infection might be a major cause of sepsis. Therefore, not only therapeutic agents but also prevention strategies that can strengthen the host immune defense system are needed for sepsis. Tamarixetin (4'-O-methylated quercetin) is a flavonoid derivative with anti-inflammatory properties against Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammation. The purpose of this study was to determine the antiinflammatory effect of Tamarixetin on inflammatory conditions induced by LPS or Escherichia coli K1. Methods: Dendritic cells (DCs) were pretreated with Tamarixetin followed by LPS or E. coli stimulation. Female Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with tamarixetin 1 hr before injecting LPS or E. coli K1. Serum and tissues were collected for further experiments. Results: Tamarixetin reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines but further increased the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in DCs induced by LPS. In addition, tamarixetin showed excellent anti-inflammatory effect on bacterial sepsis through eliminating bacteria and endotoxin. Moreover, tamarixetin further increased the population of immune cells secreting IL-10 in splenocytes of mice induced by LPS. Conclusion: Tamarixetin has anti-inflammatory effect superior to quercetin in bacterial sepsis mouse model. Its effect is associated with increased IL-10-secreting immune cells. Therefore, Tamarixetin could be used to prevent bacterial sepsis.PS 560 HCV incidence among HIV-positive MSM in Taiwan during an outbreak of acute HCV Shu-Yuan Ho 1 , Pi-Han Lin 3 , Li-Hsin Su 2 , Yi-Ching Su 2 , Chien-Ching Hung 2 , Sui-yuan Chang 1,3 . 1 Departments of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, 2 Departments of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, 3 Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University Background: Outbreaks of sexually transmitted hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have been recently reported in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in Taiwan since March 2015. We aimed to know the prevalence and incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV), which shares the same transmission route as HCV, among HIV-infected MSM receiving clinical care at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). Methods: During 2016-2017, a retrospective observational cohort study was performed to assess the incidence of recent HCV seroconversion among 2,337 HIV-infected MSM at the National Taiwan University Hospital using anti-HCV IgG kit (Mikrogen Diagnostik, Neureid, Germany). The seropositive specimens were further confirmed by anti-HCV western blot kit (Mikrogen Diagnostik, Neureid, Germany). When negative, a PCR with primers covering the NS5B region was conducted. The same PCR was used to amplify HCV sequences from seroconverters, and the HCV genotype was determined by phylogenetic analysis. Results: A total of 39 specimens (39/ 2337, 1.67%) were seropositive by anti-HCV IgG ELISA. Among the ELISA positive specimens, 9 and 39 were confirmed of HCV infection by anti-HCV western blot and HCV PCR, respectively. During a total follow-up duration of 2290 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), 30 patients had HCV seroconversion with an overall incidence rate of 16.9 per 1,000 PYFU, which is similar to the HCV incidence we observed in 2015 (16.8 per 1,000 PYFU). Of the 39 HCV seroconverters, 30 had HCV viremia and HCV sequences were successfully amplified from 30 patients. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted: 16 are genotype 2a (53.3%), 7 genotype 6a (23.3%), 4 genotype 1b (13.3%), 1 genotype 1a (3.3%), 1 genotype 3a(3.3%), and1 genotype 6n(3.3%). Three HCV transmission clusters were identified, belonging to genotype 1b, 2a, and 6a, respectively. No Sofosbuvir resistance-associated mutation S282T was identified in study subjects. Conclusions: During the outbreak of acute hepatitis C among MSM in Taiwan, the prevalence and incidence rate of HCV infection remains stable. Surveillance of HCV infection is warranted for the high-risk populations.",
