In this study, two recombinant baculoviruses were engineered and their ability to improve viral entry was examined: (1) cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) was fused with baculovirus envelope protein, GP64, to produce a cytoplasmic membrane penetrating baculovirus (vE-CTP); and (2) the protein transduction domain (PTD) of HIV TAT protein was fused with the baculovirus capsid protein VP39 to form a nuclear membrane penetrating baculovirus (vE-PTD). Transduction experiments showed that both viruses had better transduction efficiency than vE, a control virus that only expresses EGFP in mammalian cells. Interestingly, vE-CTP and vE-PTD were also able to improve the transduction efficiency of a co-transduced baculovirus, resulting in higher levels of gene expression. Our results have described new routes to further enhance the development of baculovirus as a tool for gene delivery into mammalian cells.",

            "text": "An essential requirement for baculovirus-mediated mammalian protein expression is the ability of the viruses to transport their genomes efficiently into the nuclei of the target cells. Baculovirus entry into mammalian cells is a multi-step process and is thought to be similar to that found in insect cells [4] . The first step in viral entry is the attachment of virions onto the host cell surface. The receptor on mammalian cells for AcMNPV attachment and entry is still unknown but since baculovirus can enter a variety of mammalian cells, Duisit et al. [5] and Tani et al. [6] suggested that it attaches to a common cell-surface component such as an integrin, phospholipid or heparan sulfate proteoglycan [5, 6] . The attached virus then enters the cell by endocytosis. Both clathrin-mediated and -independent endocytosis have been suggested as the route by which baculoviruses enter different types of mammalian cells [7, 8] . In the next step, a pH-dependent process mediated by baculovirus surface glycopro-tein GP64 causes fusion between the viral envelop and the endosomal membrane, and releases the viral nucleocapsids into the cytoplasm. Finally, the released nucleocapsids are transported to the nuclear pore complex [9] , enter the nucleus and are disassembled. The viral genome with the foreign transgene expression cassette is then released and transcribed [9, 10] .",

An alternative method of baculovirus-mediated gene transfer into mammalian cells is to modify the virus particle, specifically the envelope protein, GP64, or the major nucleocapsid protein, VP39, with the aim of improving the binding and entering of baculovirus to mammalian cells, thus delivering more transgene copies into the cell nucleus where they can be transcribed and expressed. Previously, pseudotype baculoviruses have been made by displaying vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG), the RGD motif, tumor-homing peptides, or avidin on the viral envelope, fused to the surface GP64 glycoprotein [14] .",

PTD-VP39 forward primer and a VP39HA reverse primer (Table 1) were used to ligate the PTD-VP39HA DNA fragment from the wildtype AcMNPV genome. The resulting PTD-VP39HA fragment was cloned into pABpaR2hX within the XmaI and NotI sites to get pABpaR2-hPTD-VP39HA. Finally the hPTD-VP39HA DNA fragment was placed into pAtE between the XhoI and NotI sites to get pAtE-hPTD-VP39HA (pE-PTD).",

In order to determine whether these modified proteins could be expressed and presented on baculovirus particles, the recombinant viruses were purified and analyzed by Western blot. CTP-GP64 and PTD-VP39 fusion proteins of predicted sizes were identified in the purified vE-CTP and vE-PTD viral particles, respectively (Fig. 1B) . Therefore not only were the proteins successfully modified; they were also able to integrate into the baculovirus envelope or capsid. To further characterize the location of these engineered proteins, immunogold labeling was performed (Fig. 1C) .

One way to measure the efficiency of viral entry is to determine the amount of viral DNA in cells after transduction. Either vE-CTP or vE-PTD was transduced into three types of mammalian cells, Vero E6, U-2OS and CHO-RD at MOI = 10, and washed three times. The eGFP-expressing recombinant baculovirus vE was used as a control. Viral DNAs from the virus transduced mammalian cells were collected at 48 hpt. These DNA samples were then subjected to Q-PCR quantification to obtain the number of virus particles within transduced cells (2.5 \u00c2 10 4 cells per sample). vE-CTP and vE-PTD showed an increased amount of viral DNA within all three types of cells in comparison with cells transduced with vE (Fig. 3A) . Vero E6 and CHO-RD cells in particular were very susceptible to vE-CTP and vE-PTD anchoring and/or penetration. This result indicates that VP39 fused with PTD, or GP64 fused with CTP, can indeed help baculovirus translocation into cells. We thus went onto investigate whether a greater number of viral particles entering cells actually led higher levels of transgene expression. Interestingly, the similar levels of viral genomic copies within the CHO-RD cells did not translate into comparable levels of transgene expression. In these cells, the total fluorescence intensity was extremely weak compared to that in U-2OS cells (Fig. 3) . This indicates that the baculovirus may encounter problems after entering CHO-RD cells and ultimately fail to express the transgene. In the cell lines which were already relatively susceptible to baculovirus transduction, Vero E6 and U-2OS, the improvements in transduction efficiencies were very significant. Recombinant vE-PTD virus (MOI = 10) raised the transduction rate from 24.9% to 73.9% in Vero E6 cells, while vE-CTP virus (MOI = 10) raised the transduction rate from 43.5% to 89.5% in U-2OS cells (Fig. 2) . The preference of a virus in different cell lines points out where is the major bottle neck for baculovirus transduction into these cells. In this case, both vE-CTP and vE-PTD worked fairly well in Vero E6, while only vE-CTP showed a significant improvement in U-2OS. This could mean that baculovirus, once penetrated U-2OS cellular membrane, would have no difficulty entering the nuclei. In CHO-RD cells, however, baculovirus may either encounter difficulty further entering the nucleus or may have difficulty expressing the target gene.",

To test whether vE-CTP and vE-PTD could also improve transgene expression of a co-transduced baculoviruses, a reporter virus vLUC (containing a luciferase gene driven by CMVie promoter) was used. The vLUC was co-transduced with vE-CTP or vE-PTD, and luciferase levels in each transduced cell sample were measured at 48 hpt. Comparing with vE, both vE-CTP and vE-PTD were able to enhance the transduction efficiency of the co-transduced baculovirus, vLUC, into target cells (Fig. 4A) . The recombinant baculovirus vLUC generated 1.7-and 2.4-fold more luciferase activities in Vero E6 cells when it was co-transduced with vE-CTP and vE-PTD, respectively, as compared to the control virus vE. In U-2OS cells, vE-CTP and vE-PTD enhanced the luciferase activity by 1.6-and 0.4-fold, respectively, comparing to the virus vE. In CHO-RD cells, enhancement of luciferase activity by vE-CTP and vE-PTD were 0.7-and 2.9-fold, respectively, to the virus vE. To confirm that this phenomenon was caused by an increased entry of vLUC virus, we performed Q-PCR using luciferase gene-specific primers (Table 1) to quantitate the copy of luciferase gene in the transduced cells. The result revealed that the copy number of vLUC DNA in the cells increased significantly when this virus is co-transduced with vE-CTP or vE-PTD (Fig. 4B) .",

In CHO-RD cells, although the overall levels of baculovirus gene expression were low, significant improvement in virus entry and gene expression were still evident. Interestingly, these membrane penetrating baculoviruses were able to improve not only their own entry into the susceptible cell lines, but also the transduction rate of a co-transduced baculovirus.

Although vE-PTD entered cells more efficiently than unmodified baculovirus vE (Fig. 3A ) in all cell lines tested, PTD led to no significant improvement in transgene expression in U-2OS cells (Fig. 3B) . A previous report by Li et al. [27] showed that expression levels of genes delivered by the assistance of PTD were cell-type specific. Although we found that PTD improved the transduction efficiency of baculovirus in CHO cells (Fig. 2) , the level of gene expression in this cell type is also very low (Fig. 3B) . Further studies showed that baculovirus actually enters CHO-RD cells quite well, indicating that baculovirus may encounter other problems perhaps relating to nuclear entry, difficulty in uncoating, poor gene expression, etc., after entering these cells.",

Electron microscopic study showed that vE-CTP or vE-PTD enters Vero E6 cells separately, without having an obvious physical association with the co-transduced reporter vLUC virus (data not shown). In other words, baculoviruses appear to enter the cells individually rather than as a group. Recently Laakkonen et al. had reported that baculovirus triggers non-phagocytic human cells uptake of Escherichia coli by clathrin-independent entry pathway [8] . We speculated that vE-CTP and vE-PTD, with their better transduction efficiency, may penetrate into mammalian cells quicker than un-modified ones and trigger these cells to take up vLUC more efficiently. Higher viral DNA contents of the reporter virus vLUC in the cotransduced cells also agreed with this speculation (Fig. 4B) .",

Further study will be required to determine the mechanism(s) that block transgene expression mediated by baculovirus transduction in different cells. We also demonstrated that the presence of an engineered membrane-penetrating baculovirus can enhance the transduction efficiency of a co-transduced baculovirus. As the uses of the recombinant baculovirus as gene delivery vectors for mammalian cells become ever more diverse, increased understanding of the interactions between baculoviruses and various mammalian cell types are crucial for foreign gene introduction into these cells. Amounts of viral genomic DNA determined by Q-PCR. Viral genomes in the transduced cells were quantified based on the sequence of luc gene. The DNA amount of luc gene, determined from the Vero E6 cells co-transduced with vLUC and vE, was set as one. The mean values and standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments are shown. All data were analyzed by t-test using independent samples. A P-value of less than 0.01 was considered significant. \u2044 P 6 0.01.",
