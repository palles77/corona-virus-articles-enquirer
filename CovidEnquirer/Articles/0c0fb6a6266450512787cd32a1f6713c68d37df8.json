            "text": "Some of the most dramatic and far-reaching advances in the understanding of the immunologic benefits of human milk have been made using newer techniques to demonstrate the specific contribution of the numerous \"bioactive factors\" contained in human milk (Table 5 -1). The multifunctional capabilities of the individual factors, the interactive coordinated functioning of these factors, and the longitudinal changes in the relative concentrations of them for the duration of lactation make human milk unique. The immunologically active components of breast milk make up an important aspect of the host defenses of the mammary gland in the mother; at the same time, they complement, supplement, and stimulate the ongoing development of the infant' s immune system. [107] [108] [109] The explosion of research on all the immunologic properties and actions of breast milk in the last 10 years makes it impossible to summarize all the important aspects of what we now know about the immunologic benefits of breast milk. The recently developed technologies of genomic studies using microarrays and proteomics promise to continue this rapid expansion of knowledge on the biology of the mammary gland, human milk, and the infant's developing immune system. This chapter emphasizes the important concepts of these immunologic benefits and refers the interested reader to the most recent literature for more extensive information on the many specific components.",

            "text": "One of the important considerations relative to measuring the immunologic benefits of breast milk is the exclusivity and duration of breastfeeding. The basic concept is identifying a dose-response relationship between the amount of breast milk received by an infant during the period of observation and the immunologic benefit gained with greater exclusivity and duration equaling greater volume of breast milk or \"dose.\" Dr. Labbok and Krasovec 149 have carefully defined breastfeeding in terms of the patterns of breastfeeding relative to the amount of supplementation with formula or other fluids or foods (full/nearly full, medium or equal, low partial, or token) to standardize the use of equatable terms in different studies. Box 5-1 outlines these definitions of the \"amount\" of breastfeeding. 153 Raisler et al 227 referred to a doseresponse relationship when they studied the effect of \"dose\" of breast milk on preventing illness in more than 7000 infants. \"Full breastfeeding\" was associated with the lowest rates of illness (diarrhea, cough, or wheeze) and even children with \"most\" or \"equal\" breastfeeding had evidence of lower odds ratios of ear infections and certain other illnesses. A number of other long-term studies demonstrated greater protection from infection with increased exclusivity of breastfeeding and durations of at least 3 months.* A couple papers demonstrated a \"dose\" effect relative to decreased occurrence of late onset sepsis in very low-birth-weight infants 73 and premature infants 245 associated with the infants receiving at least 50 mL/kg per day of mother' s milk compared with receiving other nutrition. The current recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics reinforce the importance of the doseresponse relationship between breastfeeding and the benefits of breastfeeding when it recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life and at least partial breastfeeding after the introduction of solid foods for an additional 12 months or longer. 1 Another important consideration relative to exclusive breastfeeding is the potential effect of other foods and fluids in an infant' s diet that could negatively influence immunologic benefits and infection-protective effects at the level of the GI mucosa.",

            "text": "The human immune system begins forming and developing in the fetus. Newborn infants' immune systems are immature and inadequate at birth. Immune systems rapidly adapt in the postnatal period related to the natural maturation of the skin and mucosal barriers and in response to the exposure of infants to inhaled and ingested antigens and microbial agents in the extrauterine environment. Infants' immune systems develop throughout at least the first 2 years of life. Overall, infants have limited abilities to respond effectively and quickly to infectious challenges, which explains infants' ongoing susceptibility to infections. \u2020 Box 5-2 lists most of the better understood deficiencies in infants' immune systems. An extensive discussion of these developmental immune deficiencies affecting infants is presented by Lawrence and Pane. 153 The B-lymphocytes and immunoglobulin production are deficient in the amount and specificity of antibodies produced. There is limited isotype switching and slow maturation of the antibody response to specific antigens (polysaccharides). 114, 177 The systemic cell-mediated immune response, including complement components, and both the \"classical\" and alternative pathways have limitations for complement activation. 2, 63, 251, 277 Numerous immune components are produced in limited amounts in infancy, including complement, interferon-\u03b3, secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A, interleukins (IL-3, IL-6, IL-10), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, lactoferrin, and lysozyme. 45, 87 Relative to these various immune deficits in infants, one can find various bioactive and immunomodulating factors in breast milk that are potentially capable of complementing and enhancing the development of infants' mucosal and systemic immune systems. 87, 110 This concept of bioactive and immunomodulating factors in breast milk is an important area of evolving research that has been extensively reviewed in the literature. 87, 88, 110, 144 The most intense focus of this research centers on the effects of human milk on infants' GI tract. 85, 201 ",

By this analysis, horses, with six placental membranes, pass little or no antibodies transplacentally and rely totally on colostrum for protection of foals. Humans and monkeys, having three placental membranes, receive more of the antibodies via the placenta and less from the colostrum. The transfer of IgG in humans is accomplished by active transport mechanism of the immunoglobulin across the placenta. Secretory IgA (sIgA) immunoglobulins are found in human milk and provide local protection to the mucous membranes of the GI tract. Other investigations have established that the mammary glands and their secretion of milk are important in protecting the infant not only through the colostrum but also through mature milk from birth through the early months of life.",

The data support the concept of a general system of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), which includes the gut, lung, mammary gland, salivary and lacrimal glands, and the genital tract ( Figure  5 -3). Through the immune response of MALT, a reaction to an immunogen at a mucosal site may be an effective means of producing immunity at distant sites. Antibodies against specific antigens found in milk have also been found in the saliva, evidence for transfer of protection to two different distant sites simultaneously. Evidence suggests that the mammary glands may act as extensions of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and possibly the bronchiole-associated lymphoid tissue. The ability of epithelial surfaces exposed to the external environment to defend against infectious agents has been well documented for the GI, genitourinary, and respiratory tracts. 142 sIgA and secretory IgM (sIgM) produced through the adaptive response of the mucosal-lymphoid immune system act by blocking colonization with pathogens and limiting the passage of harmful antigens across the mucosal barrier. Activated B cells and cytokines pass to the mammary gland where they contribute to the production of sIgA in breast milk. Direct contact between the antigen and the lymphoid cells of the breast is unlikely. 202 Peyer patches, tonsils, and other MALT structures appear to be well developed at birth. 24 Nevertheless, the actual effective production of sIgA to various antigens presented to infants' mucosal surfaces (respiratory and GI tracts) is still inadequate to protect against infection. A breastfeeding infant, as part of the maternal-infant dyad exposed to the same antigens via their mucosal services, can receive protective sIgA and sIgM in the mother' s breast milk produced by the mother' s MALT ( Figure 5-1) .",

Whether milk PMNs actually perform a role in protection of the infant has been studied by many investigators using many techniques. Briefly, animal studies have shown that (1) the mammary gland is susceptible to infection in early lactation, (2) a dramatic increase in PMNs occurs with mammary inflammation, and (3) in the presence of peripheral neutropenia during chronic mastitis, severe infection of the gland occurs. This implies, according to Buescher and Pickering, 33 that the primary function of milk PMNs is to defend the mammary tissue per se and not to impart immunocompetence to the newborn. This may explain the presence of large numbers of PMNs that are relatively hypofunctional early and then disappear over time.",

In animals, mothers may give their suckling newborn immunoreactive lymphocytes. The influence of maternal milk cells on the development of neonatal immunocompetence has been demonstrated in several different immunologic contexts. Congenitally, athymic nude mice nursed by their phenotypically normal mothers or normal foster mothers had increased survival.

Cell-free, defatted, filtered colostrum as well as mature breast milk showed an enhancing effect on B-cell proliferation and generation of antibody secretion. This was not seen with formula. Juto suggested that this could represent an important immunologic mechanism. Goldblum et al 82 were able to show a B-cell response in human colostrum to E. coli given to the mother orally, which was not accompanied by a systemic response in the mother. This suggests that the breast and breast milk reflect sites of local humoral or cell-mediated immunity, which were initially induced at a distant site such as the gut and transferred via reactive lymphoid cells migrating to the breast. Head and Beer 115 provided a scheme to describe this mechanism (see Figure 5 -1). The diagram depicts the progeny of specifically sensitized lymphocytes that originated in GALT, specifically Peyer patches, as they migrate to the mammary gland. As they infiltrate the mammary gland and its secretion, they supply the breast with immune cells capable of selected immune responses. Ogra and Ogra 202, 203 suggest that the cells may selectively accumulate in the breast during pregnancy. The responses of milk cells and their antibodies are not representative of an individual' s total immunity. 212 Most of these immunocompetent cells, initially stimulated in GALT, recirculate to the external mucosal surface and populate the lamina propria as antibody-producing plasma cells. A substantial number of these antigen-sensitized cells selectively home-in to the stroma of the mammary glands and initiate local IgA antibody synthesis against the antigens initially encountered in the respiratory or intestinal mucosa. 18 More recent work on human-milk-derived B cells demonstrates that breast milk contains activated memory B cells, different than those in the blood. These cells express mucosal adhesion molecules (\u03b1 4 \u03b2 7 -/+ , \u03b14\u03b2 1 + , CD44 + , CD62L -) suggesting origin in the mammary gland, but similar to GALT-associated B cells. 265 The mucosae-associated epithelial cytokine CCL28 may contribute to migration of and retention of these cells in the mammary gland. 274 This information supports the concept of the mammary gland as an effector site of the mucosal immune system.",

Plasma levels were poorly correlated. The findings suggest possible local mammary production rather than positive transfer. The question of whether IgE or IgD antibodies in breast milk have similar specificities for antigens as the IgA antibodies in milk remains unanswered. 171 Keller et al 139 examined the question of local mammary IgD production and its possible participation in a mucosal immune system by comparing colostrum and plasma levels of total IgD with specific IgD antibodies. From their work comparing colostrum/plasma ratios for IgG, IgD, and albumin and measuring IgD against specific antigens, the authors reported evidence for IgD participation in the response of the mucosal immune system, with increases in total IgD and IgD against specific antigens found in colostrum.",

            "text": "To address the question of total quantities of immunologic components secreted into human milk per day and available to an infant, Butte et al 36 Lysozyme, in contrast, rose during the same period in total amount available and amount per kilogram per day. The authors 36 suggest that production and secretion of these immunologic factors by the mammary gland may be linked to the catabolism of the components at an infant' s mucosal tissues. When the concentrations of sIgA, IgG, IgM, \u03b1 1antitrypsin, lactoferrin, lysozyme, and globulins C3 and C4 were compared in relationship to parity and age of the mother, no consistent trend was observed. When maturity of the pregnancy was considered, however, mean concentrations of all these proteins were higher, except for IgA, when the delivery was premature. Because several proteins in human milk have physiologic function in infants, Davidson and L\u00f6nnerdal 53 examined the survival of human milk proteins through the GI tract. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis showed that three human milk proteins transversed the entire intestine and were present in the feces: lactoferrin, sIgA, and \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin. Miranda et al 176 reported on the effect of maternal nutritional status on immunologic substances in human colostrum and milk. Maternal malnutrition was characterized as lower weight-to-height ratio, creatine/height index, total serum proteins, and IgG and IgA. In malnourished mothers, the colostrum contained one third the normal concentration of IgG, less than half the normal level of albumin, and lower IgA and complement C4. Lysozyme, complement C3, and IgM levels were normal. Levels improved with development of mature milk and improvement in maternal nutrition. According to one report in 2003, moderate exercise during lactation does not affect the levels of IgA, lactoferrin, or lysozyme in breast milk. 165 Immunologic components contained in human milk during the second year of lactation become a significant point as more infants are nursed longer. For a longitudinal study of lactation into the second year by Goldman et al, 89 women were included who had fully breastfed their infants for 6 months to a year, and were continuing to partially breastfeed. Samples were collected by fully emptying the breast by electric pump. Table 5 -2 summarizes the concentrations of the measured factors. No leukocytes were detected. Concentrations of total IgA and sIgA, lactoferrin, and lysozyme were similar to those 7 to 12 months postpartum and during gradual weaning. sIgA antibodies to E. coli were produced in the second year, demonstrating significant immunologic benefit to the infant with continued breastfeeding. 89 IgA, IgM, and IgG were measured in nursing women from the beginning of lactation and simultaneously in the feces of their children by Jatsyk et al 130 at the Academy of Medicine in Moscow. They reported IgA to be very high in the milk and rapidly increasing in the feces. IgG and IgM levels, however, were low in both milk and feces. In normal full-term bottle-fed infants, IgA appeared in the feces at 3 to 4 weeks of age but at much lower levels than in breastfed infants. Koutras 146 reported that in the first 8 weeks of life increased amounts of sIgA are found in the stools of breastfed infants compared with formula-fed infants. The authors ascribed this phenomenon to the presence of sIgA in human milk and a stimulation of the local GI production of immunoglobulin.",

Heat treatments include low-temperature, short-time 56\u00b0 C for 15 minutes; Holder pasteurization 62.5\u00b0 C for 30 minutes; high-temperature, short-time 70\u00b0 to 73\u00b0 C for 15 seconds; boiling 100\u00b0 C for greater than 1 minute; sterilization, variable time periods, Pretoria pasteurization 56\u00b0 to 62.5\u00b0 C for approximately 15 minutes 131 ; flash heating 56\u00b0 C for approximately 6 minutes with a peak temperature at 72\u00b0 C 127, 128 ; and microwave heating, with milk temperatures of 20\u00b0 to 77\u00b0 C for 30 seconds. 225 Boiling or sterilization essentially destroys 100% of immunologic activity. sIgA and lysozyme activities drop by 20% with Holder pasteurization and by 50% at 65\u00b0 C. Neither low-temperature, short-time nor high-temperature, short-time reduces the sIgA or lysozyme content markedly. IgG and IgM are greatly reduced by Holder pasteurization. sIgA differs antigenically from serum IgA. IgA can be synthesized in the nonlactating as well as in the lactating breast. It is a compact molecule and resistant to proteolytic enzymes of the intestinal tract and the low pH of the stomach. sIgA present in human milk is primarily manufactured by plasma cells in the mammary gland, modified in its translocation across the mammary epithelia and only minimally produced by the cellular lymphocytes in milk. Levels in milk are 10 to 100 times higher than in serum. Levels in cow milk are very low, that is, a tenth of the level in mature human milk (0.03 mg/dL). Later in life, the human intestinal tract's subepithelial plasma cells secrete IgA. The intestinal secretion of sIgA does not occur in the neonatal period but increases between 4 to 12 months of life.",

Lactoferrin has been shown to limit the formation of biofilms by specific organisms, inhibit adhesion to host cells by other organisms and to directly bind to viral particles of herpes simplex virus, HIV, and adenovirus. A proteolytic action of lactoferrin appears to inactivate virulence factors of some organisms. Separately, lactoferrin binds directly to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and integrins interrupting the binding of various viruses (herpes simplex virus, HIV, adenovirus, CMV, hepatitis B virus [HBV]) to host cells. Pepsin hydrolysate products of lactoferrin (B or H) may exert a direct bactericidal effect by binding to lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative organisms and disrupting bacterial membranes. 263 Lactoferrin may cause an increased release of cytokines by cells including antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. 50, 157 Others have shown that lactoferrin suppresses the release of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1, all proinflammatory cytokines, which would be more of an immune-modulating effect. 157 Other investigators using a recombinant human lactoferrin (talactoferrin) demonstrated evidence of lactoferrin causing increased maturation of DCs 252 and talactoferrin causing the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages 233 as other examples of how lactoferrin affects the innate immune protection of the growing infant. Several other effects have been proposed for lactoferrin, including inhibition of hydroxyl radical formation, decreasing local cell damage; lipopolysaccharide binding, also leading to a diminished inflammatory response; and DNA binding, affecting transcription and possibly regulation of the production of cell products. 198 Activation of natural killer (NK) cells, modulation of complement activity, and blocking of adhesion of enterotoxigenic E. coli and Shigella flexneri 98 are other proposed actions of lactoferrin. A specific region of lactoferrin, near the N terminus of the molecule, is strongly basic and is reported to mediate some of lactoferrin' s antimicrobial activity. \"Lactoferricins,\" small peptides containing this basic region, produced by proteolytic cleavage reportedly bind to lipopolysaccharide, leading to disruption of the bacterial cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane. 263 In another area of immune protection, lactoferrin may limit cancer development. 157 The proposed mechanisms of its anticancer effects includes increasing NK cell cytotoxicity, increased production of IL-18 and inhibition of angiogenesis, augmented apoptosis of cancer cells and initiation of cell cycle arrest in growing tumor cells. 157 The multiple roles and proposed mechanisms of action of lactoferrin in breastfed infants continue to be more specifically elucidated.",

They postulated that the low level of interferon-\u03b3 (0.7 to 2 pg/mL) might be adequate to protect against infection without hyperactivation of T cells. Interferon is produced by NK cells and by T cells, phenotypically Thy0 and Thy1. It can cause increased expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules, increase macrophage function, inhibit IgE and IL-10 production, and produce antitumor and antiviral activity. The exact role of interferon-\u03b3 in breast milk has not been delineated.",

Oligosaccharides are composed of a basic core structure derived from glucose, galactose, or N-acetylglucosamine and are linked to a variety of terminal fucose linkages or sialic acid linkages to create numerous different compounds. Oligosaccharides compose the major portion of glycoconjugates in milk and are present in the milk-fat globule membrane and in skim milk. 188, 192 Gangliosides are glycolipids found in the plasma membrane of cells, especially in cells in the gray matter of the brain. More specifically, gangliosides are glycosphingolipids that contain sialic acid, hexoses, or hexose amines as the carbohydrate component and ceramide as the lipid component of the molecule. The predominant gangliosides in human milk are GM1, GM2, GM3, and GD3, as reported by Newburg. 190 A diverse abundance of these complex carbohydrates are synthesized by the many glycosyltransferases contained in the mammary gland. Mucin and lactadherin are two glycoproteins included in this group that have antimicrobial effects. 238 Some of these carbohydrate molecules are structurally similar to glycans on the surface of small intestine epithelial cells that act as receptors for microorganisms. One proposed mechanism for the antimicrobial effect of these soluble substances is direct binding with the potential pathogenic organisms. 189, 190 Schroten et al 247 proposed that mucins contained in the human milk fat-globule membrane can block bacterial adhesion throughout the intestine after studying the adhesion of S-fimbriated E. coli to buccal epithelial cells.",

Two other groups of researchers have documented variation of the composition of glycans in human milk over the first 4 months of lactation 47 and variations in the composition of glycans in diverse populations. 64 Therefore a diverse repertoire of glycans are present in large amounts in human milk, which persist intact in the intestine and reach the urine, and have demonstrated inhibitory effects on a variety of pathogens.

Although much of their effect is on lymphocyte activation and differentiation, it is now known that ILs act on and are produced by a variety of cells. 91 Goldman et al 91 identified IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in breast milk (Table 5-6). Srivastava et al 254 reported measuring moderate amounts of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in the different stages of breast milk. Very low amounts of IL-1\u03b2 were detected, especially in comparison with the amount of IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA), which presumably could block the activity of the small amount of IL-1. Hawkes et al 113 reported on the amount of cytokines in breast milk over the first 12 weeks of lactation. The proposed \"proinflammatory\" cytokines, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, were present in only 7 of 36 mothers who donated samples at each point throughout the study. A broad range of concentrations of each of these cytokines was seen during the course of the study. The \"antiinflammatory\" cytokines, transforming growth factor (TGF) -\u03b1 1 and TGF-\u03b2 2 , were present in significant amounts in all samples. IL-2 has also been reported in breast milk in 81% of the mothers tested, with milk (aqueous) levels correlating with plasma IL-2 levels. IL-2 was constitutively produced from 57% of milk cell samples and IL-2 production was markedly increased by stimulation of the cells with Con A. 29 IL-6 has been identified in breast milk by other investigators, especially in the first 2 days of life. 209, 234 The authors suggest that IL-6 in human milk may augment the newborn' s immune functions before the body can begin full production of cytokines. Specifically, this is accomplished by increasing antibody production, especially IgA; enhancing phagocytosis; activating T cells; and increasing \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin production by mononuclear phagocytes. IL-7 is a chemokine known to improve thymic output in animals and appears related to the proliferation and survival of T cells in all stages of development. 194 Ngom et al 194 have described improved thymic function in exclusively breastfed infants associated with higher IL-7 concentrations in the mother' s breast milk. The breast milk of Gambian mothers contained variable levels of IL-7, but the geometric mean levels were higher in the first 8 weeks postpartum in mothers whose infants were born in the \"harvest-season\" (January to June) compared with those mothers whose infants were born in the \"hungry-season.\" The authors postulate that IL-7 in breast milk enhances T-cell proliferation and survival and overall thymic development in the infant, leading to long-term benefits in protection from infection.",

Leach et al, 154 recognizing the complex nature of digestion and absorption of nucleotides and related products, attempted to measure the total potentially available nucleosides (TPANs) in human milk using solid-phase extraction, highperformance liquid chromatography analysis, and enzymatic hydrolysis of the various fractions. They analyzed breast milk samples at various stages throughout lactation (colostrum; transitional, early, and late mature milk) from 100 European women and 11 American women. They used an aqueous TPAN-fortified solution containing ribonucleosides, 5\u2032-mononucleotides, polymeric RNA, and nucleoside-containing adducts to estimate the accuracy of their process.",

The mean ranges of TPAN values were 82 to 164 mmol/L for colostrum, 144 to 210 mmol/L for transitional milk, 172 to 402 mmol/L for early mature milk, and 156 to 259 mmol/L for late mature milk (Table 5-7) .

Effects on the immune system, related to nucleotide supplementation to the diet, have mainly been reported from animal studies and include increased mortality rate from graft-versus-host disease, improved delayed-type cutaneous hypersensitivity and alloantigen-induced lymphoproliferation, reversal of malnutrition and starvation-induced immunosuppression, increased resistance to challenge with S. aureus and C. albicans, and enhanced T-cell maturation and function. 218 Spleen cells of mice fed a nucleotide-free diet produce lower levels of IL-2, express lower levels of IL-2 receptors, and have decreased NK cell activity and macrophage activity. 40, 41 Presumably these nucleotide-associated changes are related to T-helper/inducer cells and the initial phases of antigen processing and lymphocyte proliferation. 41, 42, 266 In vitro and in vivo experiments have documented that ingested nucleotides increased iron absorption, perhaps affecting xanthine oxidase. 224 Although in vitro studies showed that added nucleotides enhanced the growth of bifidobacteria, conflicting results have been obtained on the influence of dietary nucleotides on the fecal flora of infants receiving breast milk or nucleotide-supplemented formula. 11, 224 Clinical studies in infants receiving nucleotide-supplemented formula demonstrated increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lower very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increased long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and changes in red blood cell membrane phospholipid composition. 11 Supplementation studies in animals have shown enhanced GI tract growth and maturation, improved intestinal repair after diarrhea, stimulation of hepatic growth, and augmented recovery from hepatectomy. 218 A recent review discusses the effects of dietary nucleotides on the immune system and protection against infection reported in studies in the literature. 244 Carver et al 41 \u2020Adducts are of the form nucleoside-phosphate-phosphate-X, where X is a biologically relevant moiety (e.g., uridine diphosphate-galactose or nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide). 4 months, NK cell activity and IL-2 production were higher in the breastfed and nucleotidesupplemented groups compared with those receiving formula without nucleotide supplements. Infections occurred infrequently in all groups, but slightly less in the breastfed group. No differences were noted in hematologic profiles and plasma chemistry values, and no toxicity or intolerance was associated with nucleotide supplementation. The sample size was small, marked variability was seen in the IL-2 measurements, and the differences noted at 4 months were less than at 2 months. Therefore the authors concluded that dietary nucleotides may contribute to improved immunity in breastfed infants.",

The numbers were too small to comment on the causative agents of diarrhea, although no apparent protection against any one agent was seen. The beneficial effect of nucleotides against diarrhea was proposed to be secondary to enhanced immune response to intestinal pathogens or improved intestinal integrity or a combination of both. In a larger study of 3243 infants younger than 6 months of age, the severity of the diarrhea (duration and number of bowel movements) as well as the incidence of diarrhea was lower in the nucleotide supplemented group. 152 Two groups of premature infants fed either nucleotide supplemented (20 mg/L) or unsupplemented formula were followed, measuring the concentration of plasma immunoglobulins throughout the first 3 months of life. 184 IgG plasma concentrations were not different in the two groups during the study period.

Each distinct mucosal surface has multiple other physiologic functions including gas exchange (in the lungs), nutrient absorption (in the gut), sensory detection (in the eyes, nose and mouth) and reproduction (in the uterus and vagina). The thin, permeable nature of these barrier mucosal surfaces, their large surface area and the constant exposure to microorganisms, foreign proteins, and chemicals predisposes the mucosal membranes to damage and infection. During the first year(s) of life, when the infant' s immune system is developing and maturing, it is doing so on a systemic and a mucosal basis as well as involving both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. That development must include the ability to respond to and protect against invasive pathogens at the same time as \"tolerate\" or \"ignore\" the multitude on commensal organisms that reside at these surfaces. During this early development, breast milk contains numerous bioactive factors that supplement the immune protection at the mucosal level while limiting inflammation and contribute to the immune modulation and growth stimulation of infants' mucosal and systemic immune defenses. The mucosal immune system involves both innate mechanisms and adaptive immune mechanisms functioning in concert. The development of the mucosal immune system occurs in the prenatal period and continues in the postnatal period. The functional mucosal barrier includes the action of enzymes, chemicals, acidity or pH, mucus, immune globulins and indigenous flora. In as early as 8 weeks of gestational age, researchers have identified changes in the intestinal barrier with the development of enterocytes, goblet cells and enterochromaffin cells along with evidence of development of tight junctions between the epithelial cells. 211, 222 Mucus production, which can block adherence of pathogens to epithelial cells, demonstrates both pre-and postnatal development beginning with evidence of expression of the muc2 gene as early as 12 weeks' gestational age. 34 This is approximately the same time that Paneth cells appear in intestinal crypts. These cells secrete various products, including \u03b1-defensin, lysozyme, secretory phospholipase A 2, and TNF-\u03b1, which contribute to protection from pathogens, stem cell protection within the epithelia layer and influence the selection and number of commensal organisms. 180, 240 Secretory immune globulins sIgA and IgM act at the epithelial surface, largely without inflammation, by limiting adherence and transmigration and facilitating phagocytosis of potential pathogens.",

Overlying the isolated lymphoid follicles of the gut are specialized epithelial cells called M-cells. M-cells (membrane, microfold, or multifenestrated cells) come in direct contact with microorganisms and antigens due to a lack of a surface glycocalyx covering. These remarkable cells endocytose, phagocytose and transcytose molecules, and antigens from their luminal surface to their basal surface. Antigenpresenting cells and lymphocytes process the trancytosed molecules, presenting them to submucosal aggregates of lymphocytes. The activated lymphocytes that have responded to the specific presented antigens migrate via the lymphatics to the thoracic duct and into the blood. These lymphocytes circulate in the blood, until they return to mucosal tissues, predominantly the same ones they originated from, where they now function as effector lymphocytes in the lamina propria. This process of \"directed migration\" to specific sites occurs due to the influence of cytokines and adhesion molecules, such as chemokine CCL28 (mucosal epithelia chemokine) expressed in the colon and salivary glands and CCL25 (thymus-expressed chemokine) which effects the site-specific migration. 217 The immune response of lymphocytes in the submucosa and the subsequent directed migration to the same and other mucosal sites produces a focused response to a selected repertoire of antigens at those sites. The lactating mammary gland is an essential component of MALT. A mother' s mature effective immune response to microorganisms in her and her infant' s environment through this antigenic stimulation of MALT in the mother' s gut and respiratory mucosa and the directed migration of cells to the breast results in activated lymphocytes and antibodies in the breast milk providing protection to the infant against those microorganisms. This is a wellrecognized example of how breast milk can provide additional immune protection to the infant. It is also one of the reasons to continue breastfeeding when a mother or the infant have a possible infection. The mucosal immune system undergoes significant postnatal development, in part due to the dramatic exposure of the mucosa to large numbers of microorganisms in early postnatal life. Peyer patches are rudimentary, and few immunoglobulinproducing intestinal plasma cells are present until several weeks after birth. 24 After several weeks, germinal centers within the lymphoid follicles develop, and the number of IgM-and IgA-producing cells in the intestine increase. Immunoglobulin-producing intestinal plasma cells (primarily IgA-producing cells) in the lamina propria increase in number from 1 to 12 months of age. 257 With normal maturation of the mucosal immune system, large numbers of immunoglobulin-producing cells locate in the intestinal lamina propria. The monomeric IgA produced by these plasma cells is transported through epithelial cells to the mucosal lumen. Attachment of an epithelial glycoprotein, the membrane secretory component to two IgA molecules leads to the formation of a dimeras; the sIgA molecule is \"secreted\" at the mucosal surface. IgM, in the form of a pentamer, contains a polypeptide J-chain and is transported by the same mechanism. 25 A portion of the secretory component remains attached to the sIgA and IgM, which protects these molecules against proteolysis and contributes to their stability. Large amounts of sIgA and IgM are produced, in a similar fashion, by the mammary glands and delivered to the infant via breast milk. The sIgA and IgM remain stable in saliva and feces 105 and provide specific protection by blocking adherence and entry and facilitating inactivation, neutralization, and agglutination of a wide variety of microorganisms.",

            "text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the complex interaction between indigenous bacterial flora and the intestine is an important aspect of research into the development of the mucosal immune system. Forchielli and Walker 69 have reviewed many of these immune mechanisms acting at the mucosal level. TLRs are transmembrane receptors (pattern recognition receptors) that are capable of detecting and discriminating among various groups of potential pathogens and initiate different immune responses to them. TLRs \"recognize\" pathogenassociated molecular patterns, conserved features in the pattern of molecules expressed by pathogens and commensal organisms. Specific TLRs recognize a particular repertoire of patterns: TLR2 identifies bacterial lipoproteins and peptidoglycan molecules; TLR3 recognizes double-stranded DNA and TLR4 identifies lipopolysaccharide. Ten TLRs are recognized in humans to date; some have identified legends (pathogen-associated molecular patterns from viruses, bacteria, and protozoa) to which they bind. TLRs are present on some epithelial cells, but are predominantly expressed on macrophages and DCs. 228 Intestinal epithelial cells are influenced by gut flora and local immune response to express specific TLRs. The recognition of specific antigens by epithelial cell TLRs stimulates different intracellular signal pathways that lead to different T-lymphocyte immune responses. It has been postulated that the ongoing immune stimulation elicited by the microbial flora in the gut \"programs\" the host to predominately express different T-helper cell responses: T H 1-like, T H 2-like and T H 3-like. This is referred to as \"crosstalk\" between the indigenous intestinal flora and the body' s immune system. The T H 1-like response is described as delayed-type hypersensitivity or cellular immunity; characterized by the predominant release of IL-2, IL-12 and interferon-\u03b3. The T H 2-like is primarily humoral immunity, antibody production (especially IgE) associated with ILs: IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6. The T H 3-like response is related to oral tolerance and antiinflammatory effects in association with the release of IL-10 and TGF-10. A theoretical \"ideal\" for this system is the ability of the host to respond to various stimuli with balanced protection against the microbial invasion without excessive inflammation or damage to the host. An imbalanced (or poorly regulated) response of this system could result in an allergic reaction against food proteins (T H 2 excess) or an autoimmune inflammatory response against self-antigens (T H 1 excess). 69 Ongoing research continues to explore these molecular mechanisms, their potential contribution to allergy, autoimmune disease and normal immune function development within a fetus, infant, and young child. The role of breast milk in the development of the systemic and mucosal immune systems takes on new significance when considering these concepts and mechanisms. This is especially true when examining the role of breast milk in adding to the innate and adaptive immune response at the level of the mucosa, the effect breast milk has on the respiratory and intestinal microbiota, the purported antiinflammatory effects of breast milk, and the proposed influence of breast milk on the maturational development of the intestine. Vorbach, Capecchi, and Penninger 270 postulated that the mammary gland evolved from a protective immune gland as part of the innate immune system. They present a list of various protective molecules that are part of both mucosal secretions and human milk. They discuss how specific nutritional factors in human milk have dual functions: nutritional and protective. This highlights the dual role of the breast as a nutritional and immune organ and should stimulate further research into the breast' s role in innate immunity as a component of the mucosal immune system.",

Much of this investigation has been driven by new molecular techniques involving the analysis of ribosomal RNA sequences of microbes that might not have been identified by traditional culture techniques. The diversity of the microbiota (all the microbes which colonize the GI tract) can be viewed from different perspectives based on the technical methods used. 255 Probiotics have been broadly defined as microorganisms that can exist within a host while affording benefits for the organisms and the host. Prebiotics are substances that (through different mechanisms) increase the growth and survival of probiotic bacteria within the host. Commonly recognized probiotic bacteria are Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacteria infantis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces boulardii, and Bifidobacteria bifidus. Many more organisms are considered to be probiotic, some of which are commercially available. 178 Prebiotics are predominantly nondigestible oligosaccharides that ferment within the colon changing the ambient pH and producing small-chain fatty acids. Breast milk with its significant composition of oligosaccharides functions as a prebiotic source for an infant, facilitating the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. 52, 249 Ongoing research is exploring the potentially mutually beneficial relationship between the microbes and the host with particular attention to nutrition (the availability of nutrients, energy sources, and synthesis of vitamins as influenced by the microbes), the developing GI tract (including angiogenesis and mucosal barrier repair), 75, 186, 210 the maturation of mucosal immunity, 140,216 both the innate system 119 and adaptive system, 170 and the bioavailability and metabolism of drugs and chemicals in the GI tract. 57, 121 Specific proposed mechanisms of how probiotic bacteria and prebiotic substances contribute to an infant' s developing immune system include competition with pathogenic bacteria for colonization, strengthening the tight junctions to enhance the mucosal barrier, producing antimicrobial bacteriocidins, stimulating mucus production, stimulating peristalsis, influencing the secretion of sIgA, stimulating the crosstalk interaction between intestinal cells and colonizing bacteria to affect the mucosal immune development, and increasing the production of certain cytokines (IL-10 and interfer on-\u03b3). 75, 140, 214, 216 ",

The remaining minority of bacteria include Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Micrococcus, Enterococcus, E. coli, and other uncommon organisms in small numbers. 178, 186, 282 Lactobacillus bifidus metabolizes milk saccharides, producing large amounts of acetic acid, lactic acid, and some formic and succinic acids, which create the low pH of the stool of breastfed infants. L. bifidus also produces short-chain fatty acids in the course of colonization. Large numbers of bifidobacteria can lower the pH of the intestine, which limits the growth of some pathogens such as E. coli, Bacteroides, and staphylococci. The flora of bifid bacteria is inhibitory to certain pathogenic bacteria. Substantial clinical evidence is available to demonstrate protection against intestinal infections from S.aureus, Shigella, Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae, E. coli, rotavirus, Campylobacter, and protozoa. 81 Two facilitory actions of breast milk are apparent. The first encourages the growth of L. bifidus and thus crowds out the growth of other bacteria. In the second, the number of pathogens is also kept low by the direct action of lysozyme and lactoferrin. When the number of pathogenic bacteria is kept low, immune antibodies can keep the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria under control and limit the invasion of bacteria through the gut wall into the bloodstream.",

The significance of the microhabitats and the effect of specific microorganisms has yet to be determined. 75 At weaning, the facultative anaerobes decline in number and obligate anaerobes (Bacteroides) become the predominant organisms in the intestine. Preterm infants are colonized with different types and numbers of bacteria from full term infants. The environment of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), including incubators, widespread use of antibiotics and parenteral nutrition, and illness influence the microbial colonization. The short-and long-term effects of the different and changing GI microbiota are a concern. 186,206 This is particularly true when one considers the contributing factors or causes for sepsis, NEC, chronic lung disease, or poor neurologic outcome in NICUs.",

Two infants who were breastfed had E. coli strain 0111 in their stools but showed few symptoms. Their mothers had no detectable antibodies for strain 0111 in their milk, which would suggest that other factors in human milk protect the infant from serious illness when no antibodies are in the milk. Hanson 106 also reported the results of another study in which after colonization with a specific strain of E. coli, mothers had large numbers of lymphoid cells in their milk with antibodies to that E. coli. The mothers' serum showed no such response. This supports the concept that antigen-triggered lymphoid cells from Peyer patches seek out lymphoid-rich tissue, producing IgA in the mammary gland. The mother is immunized in the gut at the same time as her milk. It has also been shown that E. coli enteritis can be cured by feeding human milk. Schlesinger and Covelli 246 studied possible cell-mediated immunity in breastfed infants. They showed that tuberculin-positive nursing mothers had reactive T cells in their colostrum and early milk. Furthermore, 8 of 13 infants nursed by tuberculin-positive mothers had tuberculinreactive peripheral blood T cells after 4 weeks. Cord blood had no such activity. No clinical or research data suggesting a protective effect of this apparently induced tuberculin reactivity in infants are available.",

The factor was found in the fat fraction and was not destroyed by extended heating, which distinguishes it from antibodies.

Goldman et al 90 hypothesize that human milk is poor in initiators and mediators of inflammation but rich in antiinflammatory agents. Several major biochemical pathways of inflammation, including the coagulation system, the fibrinolytic system, and complement, are poorly represented in human milk. Box 5-4 outlines the antiinflammatory properties of various constituents and the paucity of certain proinflammatory mediators in breast milk. The interaction of factors in the milk with one another or with host defenses cannot be entirely predicted by examining each factor separately. When the decreased response of human milk leukocytes to chemoattractant peptides was demonstrated by Thorpe et al, 262 the failure of the response of human milk leukocytes was not caused by alterations in maternal peripheral blood leukocytes. This suggests that inhibitors are in the milk and that human milk leukocytes may be modified in the mammary gland to protect through noninflammatory mechanisms. 262 Only low numbers of basophils, mast dells, eosinophils, and cytotoxic T-cells are present in breast milk. Many other studies have documented the decreased function of milk polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages in both colostrum and mature milk. 30 The antioxidant properties of human colostrum were demonstrated by Buescher and McIlheran 31 using aqueous human colostrum on human PMNs. The colostrum significantly interfered with PMN oxygen metabolic and enzymatic activities that are important in the mediation of acute inflammation.",

Breast milk contains a large variety of antimicrobial factors that exert their protective effect without causing significant inflammation (e.g., sIgA, oligosaccharides, lactoferrin, nucleotides). Many other cells and factors in breast milk participate in a complex interaction to both protect the infant and limit the potential damaging effects of an uncontrolled inflammatory response.

            "text": "Not surprisingly, many different antigenic specificities are recognized when the colostrum or milk of one species is fed to or injected into another species. Cow milk is high on the list of food allergens, particularly in children. Sensitivity to cow milk is responsible for at least 20% of all pediatric allergic conditions, according to Gerrard. 78 Evidence indicates that IgA antibodies play an important role in confining food antigens to the gut. Food antigens given to bottle-fed infants before they can make their own IgA, and when they are deprived of that in human milk and the plasma cells, may be expected to be more readily absorbed. Glaser 80 first made the association between the drop in breastfeeding and the rise in allergy. He pioneered the theory of prophylactic management of allergy. Allergy in infancy is associated with a familial history of atopic disease and elevated cord blood IgE levels. The introduction of \"foreign\" proteins to an infant' s diet and even to the mother' s diet in the breastfeeding dyad can lead to allergic symptoms in the infant. Exclusive breastfeeding does not protect high-risk children from allergic symptoms unless the mother also adheres closely to a restrictive diet that excludes common allergens. 5, 12 A large body of literature examines whether breastfeeding protects against atopic disease. In 1988, Kramer 148 defined 12 standards for methodology and the study of allergy and breastfeeding. The standards clarified the definitions of breastfeeding, measurable outcomes, and the diagnostic criteria for specific allergic syndromes, defined children at high risk for atopic disease, and addressed methods to decrease bias and control for confounding variables. Several recent large meta-analyses have been performed assessing the protective effect of breastfeeding against allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma. 76, 77, 175 Exclusive breastfeeding during the first 3 months of life protected against allergic rhinitis (summary odds ratio 0.74; 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 1.01) with or without a family history of atopy. 175 Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 3 months was associated with lower rates of atopic dermatitis in children with a family history of atopy. 76 Exclusive breastfeeding in the first months of life was protective against asthma during childhood (odds ratio 0.70; 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.81). 77 Chapter 17 discusses the prophylactic management of the potentially allergic infant.",

            "text": "The major elements in human milk related to the infant' s immune system are direct-acting antimicrobial factors, antiinflammatory factors, and immunomodulating bioactive compounds. 108 Epidemiologic studies have produced compelling information that suggests that breastfeeding for 4 months or longer can provide some immunologic protection against some childhood-onset diseases. 85, 91, 169 In 1991, Viirtanen et al 268 reported a prospective long-term study among children in Finland that showed a significantly lower incidence of type 1 diabetes in those at-risk children who had been breastfed for 4 months or longer. Other epidemiologic studies have demonstrated a decreased incidence of type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in breastfed children. 20, 169, 197 These clinical observations have been supported in the laboratory by studies of diet control in diabetic mice. The isolation of a bovine albumin peptide as a possible trigger of type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus makes further study imperative. 136 Based on limited data, the recent Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report cautiously concluded that breastfeeding for at least 3 months reduced the risk for type 1 diabetes compared with breastfeeding for less than 3 months. For type 2 diabetes, the same report concluded that breastfeeding in infancy produced a decreased risk compared with not breastfeeding. 126 The review of the national perinatal collaborative study by Davis et al 54 showed a protective effect against development of childhood cancer by being breastfed for 4 months or longer for children followed for 10 years. The effect was greater for acute leukemia and lymphoma. The role of infant feeding practices showed a similar effect of breastfeeding as protective in postponing or decreasing the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease in childhood. 145, 232 Greco et al 97 reported a decreased risk for celiac disease in breastfed infants. The AHRQ report concluded that an association exists between breastfeeding for at least 6 months and a decreased risk for developing acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia. 126 Maternal renal allografts have a better survival rate in individuals who were breastfed in infancy compared with those who were not breastfed. 37, 143 The mechanism of these apparent long-term immunologic benefits remains unclear, although theories abound. 85 Given the potential for confounding factors and bias in large long-term studies, confirmation of these proposed benefits by additional carefully controlled trials is required.",

These activated T-cell populations are transferred to the infant through breast milk along with a variety of ILs at a time when infants are capable of only limited production of ILs. A complex interaction of ILs and cells in human milk and at the mucosal level may provide antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits to the infant.",

They confirmed the presence of M-CSF throughout lactation, as well as TGF-\u03b2 1 and -\u03b2 2 , IL-1RA, GRO-\u03b1, MCP-1, RAN-TES, and IL-8, but reported insignificant amounts of GM-CSF, stem cell factor, LIF, MIP-1\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, sIL-2R, and IFN\u03b1 (see Box 5-3 for nomenclature). Srivastava et al 254 also used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure the production of cytokine mRNA by cells in breast milk. They reported the presence of mRNA for MCP-1, IL-8, TGF-\u03b2 1 , TGF-\u03b2 2 , M-CSF, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2, which may be another source of these cytokines in breast milk. Hawkes et al 113 demonstrated that human milk cells from lactating women at 5 weeks postpartum are capable of active cytokine production in vitro (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) with and without exposure to lipopolysaccharide. Continued cytokine production by human milk cells is another explanation for the variable amounts of cytokines identified in breast milk and is further evidence that the cells are capable of responding to an infectious stimulus. In their investigations of the possible antiinflammatory effects of breast milk, Buescher and Malinowska 32 examined milk for the presence of soluble receptors and cytokine antagonists. They demonstrated soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and soluble E-selectin in colostrum",
