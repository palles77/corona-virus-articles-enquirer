The primers and exo probe were designed to be specific for a portion of spike (S) gene conserved in TGEV, but absent in the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). The amplification was performed at 40\u00b0C for 20 min. The assay could only detect the TGEV, and there was no cross-reaction with other pathogens tested. Using the in vitro transcribed TGEV RNA as template, the limit of detection of the developed RT-RPA was 100 copies per reaction. The assay performance was evaluated by testing 76 clinical samples by RT-RPA and a real-time RT-PCR. Fourteen samples were TGEV RNA positive in RT-RPA (18.4%, 14/76), which were also positive in the real-time RT-PCR. The diagnostic agreement between the two assays was 100% (76/76). The R 2 value of RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR was 0.959 by linear regression analysis. The developed RT-RPA assay provides a useful alternative tool for rapid, simple and reliable detection of TGEV in resource-limited diagnostic laboratories and on-site facilities.",

            "text": "Rapid and specific detection of TGEV would be extremely important in the prevention and control of TGE. The conventional methods for detection of TGEV are time-consuming, laborious, and requiring welltrained technicians, such as virus isolation, immunofluorescence assay, electron microscopy and ELISA (Carman et al., 2002; Dulac et al., 1977; van Nieuwstadt et al., 1988) . A series of developed RT-PCR assays for PEDV require the high-precision, sophisticated and expensive instruments, well-trained technicians and good laboratory circumstance, thus unsuitable for being applied in under-equipped laboratories and on-site applications, such as RT-PCR (Paton et al., 1997) , nanoparticle-assisted RT-PCR (Zhu et al., 2017) and real-time RT-PCR (Vemulapalli et al., 2009) . Recently, RT-LAMP assays have been developed for TGEV detection (Chen et al., 2010; Li and Ren, 2011) . Six primers were needed in the RT-LAMP assays for TGEV, the reaction time was 30 or 60 min, and the results were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis (Chen et al., 2010; Li and Ren, 2011 T Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal gene amplification technique that has been demonstrated to be a rapid, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective molecular diagnostic method (Daher et al., 2016; Piepenburg et al., 2006) . RPA employs three core enzymes: a recombinase, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) and a strand-displacing polymerase. The recombinase forms a nucleoprotein filament with primers and probes. This filament scans the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) target searching for homologous sequences and invades the dsDNA once homology is found. Then a D-loop structure is formed, which is a local separation of DNA strands in which the complementary strand is stabilized by SSB and the target strand is hybridized with primer. Recombinase disassembly from the nucleoprotein filament, the strand-displacing DNA polymerase adds bases to the 3\u2032-end of the primer and extension occurs (Daher et al., 2016; Piepenburg et al., 2006) . Real time detection of RPA amplicons could be performed through adding exonuclease III and exo probes to the reaction mixture. The exo probe typically consist of an oligonucleotide backbone that contains an abasic nucleotide analogue (tetrahydrofuran residue or THF) flanked by a dT-fluorophore and a corresponding dTquencher group. In a double-stranded context the THF residue presents a substrate for Exonuclease III, which will cleave the probe at the THF position, thereby separating the fluorophore and the quencher and generating a fluorescent signal. Real-time RPA assays had been developed for the detection of a series of important viruses in swine (Wang et al., 2017a,b) . In this study, we developed and evaluated the userfriendly on-site detection platform integrating the real-time RPA technology and a field-deployable device (Genie III tube scanner) for the rapid detection of TGEV.",

The in vitro transcribed TGEV standard RNA was produced with RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System-T7 (Promega, Madison, USA). The length from the T7 promoter region to the NdeI cut site of the pGEM-T Easy vector is 97 nucleotides, generating a total transcript of 983 nucleotides in length. The in vitro transcripts were quantified using ND-2000c and the copy number of RNA molecules was calculated by the following formula: Amount (copies/\u03bcL) = [RNA concentration (g/ \u03bcL) /(transcript length in nucleotides \u00d7 340)] \u00d7 6.02 \u00d7 10 23 .

Ten nanograms of the different pathogen genomic RNA or DNA were used as template in the RT-RPA, and only the TGEV RNA were detected by RT-RPA while the other pathogens were not detected (Fig.1) . No cross detections were observed in five independent reactions, demonstrating the high specificity of RT-RPA assay for the detection of TGEV. In the analytical sensitivity analysis, the limit of detection (LOD) of the RT-RPA was 1.0 \u00d7 10 2 copies per reaction, which was the same as the realtime RT-PCR (Fig. 2) . The two-fold serial dilutions of the in vitro transcribed TGEV RNA were made from 1.0 \u00d7 10 3 to 6.25 \u00d7 10 1 copies, and from 1.0 \u00d7 10 2 to 1.25 \u00d7 10 1 copies, respectively.

Fourteen samples (18.4%, 14/76) were TGEV RNA positive in the RT-RPA, which were also positive in the real-time RT-PCR. The overall agreement between the RT-RPA and the real-time RT-PCR was 100% (76/76). The basic RPA assay were also performed for the 14 TGEV RNA positive samples using the TwistAmpTM RT Basic kit (TwistDX, Cambridge, UK), and the reaction system was the same as RT-RPA except the exo porbe was not used. The RPA amplification products were sequenced by a commercial company (Sangon, Shanghai, China), then were blasted in the GenBank. The blast results demonstrated that all the sequences showed more than 97.4% homology to TGEV strains in GenBank, which confirmed the good specificity of the RT-RPA assay for TGEV. For the positive samples, it took 4 \u221212 min in the RT-RPA to see amplification, while it took 37-56 min in the real-time RT-PCR with the Ct values ranging from 25.01 to 37.10. The performance of the RT-RPA was comparable to real-time RT-PCR, and the former is much faster. The threshold time (TT) and cycle threshold (Ct) values of the two assays were respectively well at an R 2 value of 0.959 (Fig. 3) .",

Recent advances of the RPA technology on the portable tube scanner device provide a simple, convenient and inexpensive method for the point-of-care (POC) detection of pathogens in clinical samples (Abd El Wahed et al., 2015a,b) . In this study, we developed a RT-RPA platform integrating the real-time RPA technology and a tube scanner Genie III for the rapid and sensitive detection of TGEV. Considering the close relationship between TGEV and PRCV, multiple alignment of the TGEV and PRCV S gene sequences were made, and a 561 nucleotide-long region corresponding to sequence between nucleotides 105 and 666 of the TGEV S gene ORF, which is absent from all PRCV strains, was set as the target of RT-RPA. Other TGEV strains were not included in the assay except for the isolated field strain HB-YX, which is the deficiency of this study. The RPA is tolerant to 5-9 mismatches in primer and probe showing no influence on the performance of the assay (Abd El Wahed et al., 2013; Daher et al., 2015) , and there were only 1-2 mismatches in this study with other circulating TGEV strains available in GenBank. It is assumed the assay would detect all the circulating strains of TGEV, based on the facts that the RT-RPA assay targeted the conserved S gene of TGEV.",
