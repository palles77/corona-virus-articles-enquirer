Tidal volume increases although the respiratory rate remains unchanged which results in an increase in minute ventilation that up to 50% higher than in nonpregnant women [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Minute oxygen uptake also increases, and allows for the increasing oxygen requirements as the pregnancy advances. There is no change in forced vital capacity, lung compliance, or diffusing capacity; however, functional residual capacity decreases by 15% to 20% at term. Total pulmonary resistance also decreases during pregnancy, possibly because of an increase in progesterone levels. Although overall hemoglobin amount increases and allows for an increase in total oxygencarrying capacity, the increase in blood volume-which is disproportionate to the increase in hemoglobin concentration-results in a physiologic anemia that 0889-8561/06/$ -see front matter D",

A common finding when bacterial infection develops in the setting of viral sinusitis is a report of two phases with improvement in between-a ''double sickening'' sign. A change in color of nasal discharge from clear/yellow to greenish also is an indicator of progression to bacterial sinusitis. Transillumination of the sinuses and plain radiographs of the sinuses may help to confirm sinusitis, but they cannot distinguish between viral and bacterial sinusitis [12] .

Analgesics and antipyretics; decongestants; and moisturization techniques, including nasal irrigation, steam inhalation, and warm packs are useful in providing relief. Recommended antimicrobial therapy to eradicate the bacterial pathogen varies among countries, depending on the common pathogens and patterns of antimicrobial resistance. In the United States [13] , the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery's Guidelines first line of treatment regimens include amoxicillin, amoxicillinclavulanic acid, or a second-/third-generation cephalosporin. These are acceptable regimens in pregnancy and should be given for 10 to 14 days. In penicillinallergic patients, a course of one of the macrolides, particularly azithromycin, is warranted. Macrolide resistance has become a major problem in many European countries and it is not recommended in these areas. Surveillance in the United States shows a lower rate of resistance, and macrolides remain an alternative first-line therapy for patients who have penicillin allergy. In penicillin-allergic patients, a course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole also may be considered. Telithromycin, a new antibacterial ketolide with a low propensity for drug resistance, is as effective as any first-line agent and has limited side effects [14] . Listed as pregnancy Category C, no data are available regarding its use during pregnancy in humans. Alternative regimens for bacterial sinusitis listed in the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery's Guidelines include the fluoroquinolones, but fluoroquinolones are not recommended during pregnancy and should be avoided if possible.",

A chest radiograph should be performed in patients who have the aforementioned findings and in whom pneumonia is suspected. The chest radiograph will confirm pneumonia, rule out other diagnoses, suggest a possible cause, and aid in determining the severity of illness. Multilobar pneumonia is considered a more severe process than is single lobar involvement [19] . Generally, all pregnant women who have pneumonia are hospitalized for observation and initial therapy. Work-up should include a complete blood count, electrolytes, assessment of oxygenation, and blood cultures; however, blood cultures are positive only 7% to 15% of the time [18, 21] .",

Ahmad and colleagues [30] reported 22 cases of PCP in pregnancy. The mortality was extremely high (50%). Fifty-nine percent required mechanical ventilation. These numbers may be inflated because none of the patients was on antiretroviral therapy; all were diagnosed with HIV when diagnosed with PCP.

HIV-infected patients with a CD4 + T lymphocyte count of less than 200/mL, a history of oropharyngeal candidiasis, or an AIDS-defining illness should receive prophylaxis [31] .

Influenza is caused by two RNA viruses in the family Orthomyxoviridae, influenza A and influenza B. Historically, influenza in pregnant women has been associated with a higher rate of morbidity and mortality. The course of influenza in pregnancy was reported first during the epidemic of 1918, when 1350 cases in pregnant women who had an influenza-like illness were evaluated. Pneumonia complicated 585 (43%) of the cases. In 52% of these patients, the pregnancy was interrupted. There were 308 (23%) maternal deaths. Mortality was highest in the last 3 months of pregnancy, and increased if complicated by pneumonia [33] . During the influenza epidemic of 1957, 22 pregnant women in New York City died from complications of the flu. Pregnant women accounted for nearly half of the deaths of women of child-bearing age [34] . During the same epidemic, 11 pregnant women died in Minnesota. All deaths were attributed to respiratory insufficiency secondary to pulmonary edema and pneumonia [35] . Mullooly and colleagues [36] reviewed influenza complicating pregnancy from 1975 to 1979. There were four epidemics in that 5-year period. Pregnant women sought outpatient medical attention for acute respiratory disease during the influenza season significantly more often than did nonpregnant women.",

In adults, fever generally lasts for 3 days with resolution of symptoms normally within 1 week; the cough and malaise may persist for longer than 2 weeks. Pneumonia, either viral or superimposed bacterial, is a well-recognized complication of influenza. Initially, patients present with respiratory distress in the case of viral pneumonia. On chest radiograph, diffuse bilateral infiltrates are seen. Signs of pneumonia include course rales and rhonchi, wheezing, dyspnea, and tachypnea. Typically, superimposed bacterial pneumonia occurs 2 to 14 days after symptoms of influenza have resolved. Local consolidation is seen on chest radiograph with superimposed bacterial pneumonia. Pregnant women who have influenza pneumonia should be evaluated, and may be treated with one of the antiviral agents that are approved for the treatment of influenza. The adamantines, M2 ion-channel inhibitors, include amantadine and rimantadine and have activity only against influenza A. They may be given within the first 48 hours of symptoms to reduce symptom duration. To minimize drug resistance, therapy should be discontinued within 24 to 48 hours after symptoms resolve, or within 3 to 5 days. The neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in the treatment of influenza A and B. Oseltamivir, given orally, is approved for treatment and chemoprophylaxis. Zanamivir is an inhaled medication that is approved for treatment only. There have been several reports of bronchospasm in patients who had asthma who took this drug. Both shorten the duration of symptoms by an average of 1 day. There are limited data on safety in pregnancy.

Massive hemoptysis can occur as a result of erosion into a pulmonary vessel in the wall of a tuberculin cavity. Other findings include wasting, rales, rhonchi, and clubbing of fingers because of hypoxia. On chest radiograph, the classic finding is that of an upper lobe infiltrate or cavity; however, the film may be normal or have other findings, such as nodules or diffuse infiltrates. Cavitation or mediastinal lymphadenopathy also may be seen. Although any organ system can be affected, the extrapulmonary sites that are involved most commonly in tuberculosis include lymph nodes, pleura, genitourinary tract, bones and joints, meninges, and peritoneum. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is being seen more often because of HIV coinfection. Five to 10% percent of pregnant women who have tuberculosis have extrapulmonary disease.",

Hematogenous acquisition commonly results in granulomatous complexes within the liver. Acquisition by way of aspiration results more often in complexes in the lungs or gastrointestinal tract [71] . Beitzke [68] detailed criteria for congenital tuberculosis: (1) firm diagnosis of tuberculosis in the newborn, (2) primary complex in the newborn's liver, or (3) if no primary complex is identified in the liver, tuberculous lesions must be documented in the first few days of life to exclude extrauterine infection. In many cases, the newborn is diagnosed before the mother. Hageman and colleagues [72] reviewed cases of congenital tuberculosis. The most common signs and symptoms, in descending order, were respiratory distress, fever, liver/spleen enlargement, poor feeding, lethargy, and lymphadenopathy. In this review, neonatal mortality was 46%; however, in three quarters of the deaths, there was no treatment because the diagnosis was made post mortem. Initially, tuberculin testing may be negative and may remain so for several months. Neonatal tuberculosis is far more common, and occurs when the newborn is infected after exposure to the infected mother or other family member.",

The PPD tuberculin skin test is the only test that can detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection reliably in asymptomatic persons. The test becomes positive 2 to 12 weeks after infection [73] . Sensitized CD4 + lymphocytes travel to the site, proliferate, and produce cytokines; consequently, a raised, erythematous area forms. The size of the reactive area determines whether the test is positive. The size of the reactive area that is used to define a positive test varies with risk factors. Induration of at least 5 mm is used for patients who have HIV infection, recent contact with a person with active tuberculosis, organ transplant, or fibrotic changes on chest radiograph that are consistent with old tuberculosis. An induration of at least 10 mm is used in patients who are recent immigrants (within 5 years) of high prevalence countries, intravenous drug users, residents or employees of high-risk settings (eg, jails, nursing homes, shelters, hospitals), or who have conditions that are associated with a high risk of disease after infection. An induration of at least 15 mm is used for low-risk people [74] . The test has low sensitivity and specificity in the case of active tuberculosis. In addition, false negative results are common in immunocompromised patients. Patients who have received the bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine can have a false-positive test, although the skin induration rarely exceeds 20 mm in false positive results [75] .",

If tissue is obtained for culture, it is important that it not be put in formaldehyde because this compromises test accuracy. Definitive diagnosis depends on the isolation and identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from a diagnostic specimen, such as sputum or tissue. Culture is a time-consuming process because Mycobacterium tuberculosis can take 4 to 8 weeks to grow; however, it is important because drug susceptibilities can be determined and treatment can be optimized for the individual patient [76] .",

INH, rifampin, and ethambutol (EMB) should be used in initial treatment regimens. If local prevalence of isolates that are resistant to INH is high, pyrazinamide should be added to this regimen until the results of susceptibility testing are available. These medications cross the placenta, but were not shown to have teratogenic effects [25] . Women who are being treated can breastfeed. Although these medications are found in breast milk, the amount of drug does not reach therapeutic levels, and is not sufficient for treatment of the newborn [79] . Pregnant and postpartum women should receive pyridoxine. Table 1 lists the medications that are used in the treatment of tuberculosis. INH dosing can be daily or two to three times per week. Side effects include aminotransferase elevations, hepatitis, peripheral neurotoxicity, and a lupuslike syndrome. Hepatitis seems to be more common in pregnant patients who take INH; thus, liver enzymes should be evaluated frequently and pyridoxine should be administered. The dose of pyridoxine in prenatal vitamins can vary, and generally, the dose is inadequate for this purpose. Rifampin also is a first-line agent with dosing once daily or two to three times per week. Side effects include rash, nausea/vomiting, and hepatitis. Patients must be warned that rifampin will turn urine, sweat, sputum, and tears orange [80, 81] . EMB is a first-line drug for treating all forms of tuberculosis. It is included in initial treatment regimens, primarily to prevent emergence of rifampin resistance when primary resistance to INH may be present. Adverse effects include retrobulbar neuritis, peripheral neuritis (rare), and skin reactions that require discontinuation of the drug. EMB is considered safe for use in pregnancy [25] . Pyrazinamide is a first-line agent that is highly active against dormant and semidormant bacterial populations [82] . Hepatotoxicity that is attributable to standard doses of pyrazinamide (PZA) occurs in approximately 1% of cases [83] . Mild anorexia and nausea are common. Transient morbilliform rash also can occur but usually is self-limited. There is little information about the safety of PZA in pregnancy. The benefits of PZA may outweigh the possible risks in areas in which drug-resistant tuberculosis is endemic [84, 85] . Streptomycin should be avoided in pregnancy because of an increased risk of congenital deafness.",
