Because infected horses remain infected for life, often without showing any recognizable clinical signs, there was a major research effort aimed at developing an accurate diagnostic test in the early 1970s. In 1972, Dr. Leroy Coggins developed su<::h a test. Known by most veterinarians and horse owners as the Coggins test: this test became the basis for widespread federal and state regulations aimed at eliminating carriers of the virus. Research on EIA slowed until the mid-1980s, when scientists recognized the close relationship between EIA virus (EIA V) and the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV). This has led to renewed research into the pathogenesis of EIA and to many new discoveries about the virus and the disease.",

Highest titers are found in serum, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, lung, and kidney. 58, 70, 85. 88 The majority of viral replication during a febrile episode appears to occur in mature tissue macrophages of these tissues, not in circulating blood monocytes. 88 Most horses spontaneously recover from the initial viremic episode over a period of several days, appear clinically normal for a variable period of time (days to weeks), and then experience recurring episodes of fever, thrombocytopenia, and depression!4 Each febrile episode is associated with viremia that resolves coincident with resolution of fever. Between febrile episodes, circulating virus is highly cell-associated and not free in plasma. The frequency and severity of febrile episodes decline over time, with most clinical episodes occurring during the first 12 months after infection.57 Many horses eventually cease having clinical episodes of fever and viremia and become inapparent carriers of the virus. 57 A few horses progress to a chronic debilitating form of the disease with classic clinical signs of weight loss, anemia, edema, and eventually death. Most EIAV-seropositive horses appear healthy, and owners frequently report that they never noticed clinical signs of disease. It is likely that horses infected with a less virulent strain of the virus or with a lower titer inoculum experience only a mild febrile or thrombocytopenic episode that could easily pass undetected by all but the most observant owner. Diagnosis is made more difficult early in infection because these horses may be seronegative until 45 days postinfection.' 6 Despite the fact that some horses show no recognizable clinical signs, they continue to harbor the virus, serve as a reservoir of infection for the remainder of their life, and are a risk to uninfected horses they contact. 23 , 41 Administration of immunosuppressive drugs such as ,dexamethasone can often precipitate viral replication and clinical disease in these horses. 6o",

Anti-EIA V antibody may be detectable by agar gel immunodiffusion (ACID) in the cerebrospinal fluid of horses with neurologic signs,64 TRANSMISSION EIAV is transmitted between infected and uninfected horses by transfer of blood or blood products, This most commonly occurs during the interrupted feeding of large hematophagous insects, especially of the family Tabanidae (horseflies and deerflies). 33, 34, 45, 96 Transmission may also occur iatrogenically through the administration of contaminated blood transfusions, use of contaminated hypodermic needles, or use of nonsterile, contaminated surgical instruments (including teeth floats), Transplacental and colostral transmission are also possible.53,loo EIA V can be transmitted by the interrupted feeding of single horsefly.34, 54 Factors influencing the efficiency of transmission include the availability of appropriate vectors, the distance between horses, and the virus titer in the blood of infected horses. Tabanids are more likely to transmit virus than mosquitoes for two reasons, The large mouthparts of tabanids are capable of carrying a much larger quantity of blood (up to 10 nL) than are the small mouthparts of mosquitoes. 22 In addition, these large mouthparts inflict much more painful bites than smaller insects. Because flies act only as mechanical vectors in the transmission of EIA V and virus does not live long on the mouthparts of these insects (between 30 minutes and 4 hours),34 effective transmission of virus requires that a fly begin feeding on an infected horse, be interrupted, and immediately fly to an uninfected horse and resume feeding. 54 The large mouthparts of horseflies and deerflies inflict painful bites, which horses are likely to interrupt by tail swishing, biting, or other body movements, When a fly is interrupted in the middle of a blood meal, it will immediately seek to complete that meal by rebiting the initial host or by biting a nearby animal. The flight range of horseflies can exceed 4 miles,94,95 but flies will seek to complete their meal as rapidly as possible on the nearest horse. If the initial host is separated from other animals by a distance of 200 yards or more, the fly is much more likely to resume feeding on the original host than it is to fly the distance required to find a new host. 2l These considerations form the basis for many state EIA V regulatory decisions.",

            "text": "Acutely infected horses undergoing a febrile reaction have higher plasma virus titers than infected afebrile horses by factors of 1000 to 100,000,60 Therefore, there is a greater probability of virus transmission from a febrile horse than from a horse with no clinical signs, and clinically ill horses probably serve as the major impetus for transmission during a propagating epizootic. 14 Despite these considerations, the inapparent carrier remains viremic indefinitely, and several studies have shown that these animals remain a potential source for virus transmission under field conditions?3, 46, 54 Most virus in these horses is highly cell-associated, confined to a small percentage of Circulating mononuclear leukocytes. 14 All serologically positive horses should be considered reservoirs of infection and potentially infectious to other animals. Venereal transmission of virus is possible but probably does not occur frequently. Subcutaneous inoculation of experimental horses with fresh semen from an EIAV-infected stallion will transmit the virus. 97 One mare, pastured only with EIAV-negative animals, seroconverted following breeding to a chronically infected stallion. lOo This mare exhibited slight hemorrhage from the vulva after breeding. Infected stallions may have reduced fertility. Evaluation of semen from two stallions chronically infected with EIA V revealed decreased motility, reduced sperm count, and abnormal morphologic features of spermatozoa. IOO Potential routes of infection between mares and foals include transplacental transfer, colostral or milk transmission, and vector transmission. Transplacental transmission of EIA V is most likely to occur if the dam experiences an acute febrile reaction with accompanying high titer viremia during gestation,50 This may result in abortion or in birth of infected foals. Experimental infection of equine fetuses resulted in abortion if foals were infected on or before 203 days of gestation. Abortion occurred between 21 and 64 days postinfection. If fetuses were infected later in gestation, foals were born seropositive but died within 60 days.\" Experimentally, less than 10% of foals born to mares with no clinical signs of EIA during gestation were born virus-and antibody-positive. 6 ,53 Uninfected foals that nurse colostrum from an infected mare will absorb anti-EIA V colostral antibodies. lOo Colostral antibody is generally undetectable by 6 months of age. 6 There is some evidence that virus may be transmitted in colostrum or milk, but this has not been definitively determined, Because insects preferentially feed on adult horses, insect transmission between infected mares and their uninfected foals does not appear to be a major problem. 24 ,48 In one pasture-based study of 22 mares and 13 foals, foals had only 2.43% of the tabanid feeding occurrences as compared to mares. 24 This was not due to the foal's smaller size, because flies are just as likely to feed on adult ponies as on adult horses if the two are grazing side by side. 24",

Retinal depigmentations and prominent choroidal vessels have been observed in the eyes of some clinically normal EIAV-infected horses, Histopathologically, chronic nongranulomatous choroiditis with foci of lymphocytic infiltrates is present in these horses.lO o IMMUNOPATHOGENESIS Immediately after infection, EIA V replicates to high titer, primarily in mature tissue macrophages of the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, lung, kidney, and adrenal glands. 88 Progeny virions are released into circulation, and titers of virus in plasma appear to parallel increases in rectal temperature. The presence of a high concentration of viral antigens in the circulation and in tissues stimulates host antibody production. Specific antiviral antibody is frequently detectable by Western immunoblot as early as 7 to 10 days postinfectionY By 45 days postinfection, antibody to the p26 core protein is detectable by ACID in almost all infected horses. 16 A marked antibody response also develops to the external envelope glycoproteins of the virus, gp90 and gp45. The net result is a heterogeneous hypergammaglobulinemia with increases in IgC, IgC(T), and IgM concentrations by 60 days postinfection, especially in horses that experience multiple febrile episodes. '1 Resolution of serum viremia and its associated febrile episode is dependent on specific B-and T-cell-mediated responses. B3 The rapid appearance of high levels of antibody in the serum of infected horses might implicate their involvement in clearance of virus from circulation. However, in vitro studies demonstrate that most neutralizing anti-EIA V antibodies are directed against highly variable antigenic epitopes of the surface glycoproteins. 38 \u2022 82 These antibodies are not detectable in the serum of infected horses until days to weeks after resolution of a febrile episode, implying that neutralizing antibody is probably not important in clearance of virus from circulation. Most investigators now feel that cellmediated immune responses must be critically involved in this important function.",

Local horse shows, race tracks, pony club meetings, trail rides, boarding stables, and so forth also have the option of requiring a negative EIA V test prior to participation or entry.",

Some states require tattoo or brand markings before that horse can be transported anywhere in that state.",

Brands may be hot iron, chemical, or freezemarking. They must be at least 2 inches high and should be placed on the left shoulder or left side of the neck. Lip tattoos should be not less than 1 inch high and 3/ 4 inch wide and should be placed on the inner surface of the upper lip.

            "text": "Since widespread EIAV control measures were instituted in the early 1970s, the incidence of EIA has decreased dramatically throughout the United States. In 1972, the first year of testing, most positive horses were found in Gulf Coast states where temperature and humidity favor a prolonged vector season. In Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, 12.8% of 12,086 horses tested were seropositive. In contrast, only 2.6% of 66,675 horses tested in other states were seropositive. By 1975, the percentage of seropositive tests had diminished to 4.4% and 1.06% in Gulf Coast and other states, respectively. The United States map in Figure 2 illustrates that the Gulf Coast region still has the greatest number of positive EIA tests, although the absolute numbers have decreased dramatically since the early years of testing. Of 993,712 EIA V tests reported in the United States between October 1, 1990 and September 30, 1991, only 2755 (0.277%) were positive. Arkansas had the largest absolute number of positive tests (494) and the highest percent positive (1.65%) . 55 Although federal and state controls have markedly decreased the incidence of EIA in the United States, the disease has not been eradicated. Outbreaks of disease still occur3\u00b0 and may be increasing in some areas because of a decrease in vigilance on the part of horse owners, veterinarians, and others. Owners and veterinarians can voluntarily implement a variety of control measures to decrease the chance of exposure of their horses to infected horses. These measures include 1. Require a negative EIA V test prior to purchase of any horse, donkey, or mule. 2. Require documentation of a recent negative EIA test prior to permitting entry of any new horse to the premises. If a horse originates from a state with a high incidence of EIAV-positive horses (e.g., Gulf Coast states), this test should probably be dated within 30 days of entry to the farm. If 331 a horse ongmates from a state with a low incidence of EIAV-positive horses, a test within 6 months to 1 year should be adequate. 3. Institute fly control measures wherever possible. 4. Encourage officials of any event involving the congregation of large numbers of horses to require a recent negative EIA test for all horses participating. 5. Test all horses, donkeys, and mules on the premises at least once a year. 6. Do not permit injections of different horses with a common needle. Thoroughly disinfect all surgical instruments, tattoo instruments, and teeth floats after each use.",

            "text": "The ability of EIA V to persistently infect horses in the face of a profound immune response by the host makes it a potentially devastating disease for the horse population of the United States. Its ability to evade host immune defenses by lying dormant in apparently healthy animals and by rapidly changing its antigenic determinants is proving to be a major obstacle to vaccine development. Because most infected horses appear clinically normal and a large proportion of horses in this country remain untested, the virus is not likely to be eradicated in the near future. Yet, for the same reason, because most horses infected with EIAV appear clinically normal, there is a tendency for the horse industry to become complacent in its efforts to control the virus. The cooperation of horse owners, veterinarians, and regulatory officials is necessary to keep the threat of EIA in check in the United States.",
