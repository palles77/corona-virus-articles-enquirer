            "text": "After the death of a premature infant from rotavirus-associated necrotizing enterocolitis, we instituted prospective surveillance for this disease in our neonatal intensive care unit. During the 4-month study period an additional six cases of necrotizing enterocolitis and eight cases of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis occurred. Rotavirus infection was documented in 11 of these 15 symptomatic infants, in comparison with only eight rotavirus infections in 147 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic babies (P <0.0001). Stools from 110 nursery personnel tested during the outbreak did not contain rotavirus. However, 12 of 59 staff members had serum IgM antibody against rotavirus, suggesting recent infection. In a case-control study we compared babies with severe gastrointestinal illness with a control group randomly selected from asymptomatic babies in the nursery during the time of the outbreak. Univariate analysis found six categorical variables and nine continuous variables that were significantly associated with disease. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, however, found only birth weight (P <0.0001), rotavirus infection (P <0.0001), and age at time of first nonwater feeding (P <0.02) to be associated with gastrointestinal illness. This study provides further evidence for the role of infection in some cases of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis and hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. ( In May 1983 an infant with NEC and bowel perforation was transferred to our NICU for surgical bowel resection. Five days later a previously asymptomatic (for GI disease) infant developed fulminant NEC with bowel perforation and died within 24 hours. His stool, surgically resected intestine, and autopsy intestinal tissue all were positive for rotavirus by multiple testing methods. Serologic studies confirmed rotavirus infection in both infants. We immediately initiated a two-part investigation: prospective surveillance for rotavirus prevalence in the NICU, and a case control study of risk factors for severe GI disease. In this report we describe the results of our investigation.",

Recently, howev-The Journal of Pediatrics January 1988 er, a prospective study of delayed feedings failed to show benefit in preventing NEC. 28 Rotaviruses are the most common cause of diarrheal disease among young children, but their role in neonatal GI disease is disputed. These agents are found in the stools of asymptomatic infants in some nurseries. 8, 9 This report may be the strongest evidence to date of an etiologic role for rotavirus in NEC and HGE. Prospective sampling of all infants during the course of an outbreak avoids many of the pitfalls of other methods for determining cause. Asymptomatic shedding of virus, if it occurs, should be readily demonstrable with such a study design. We did not observe such a pattern; rather, the presence of rotavirus was strongly associated with severe GI symptoms. In one instance, our progressive sampling protocol detected rotavirus 24 hours before the onset of symptoms. In two other babies, intermittent viral shedding, previously not well recognized in rotavirus infection, was demonstrated with this prospective approach.",

Our attempt to clarify this latter issue identified distinguishing characteristics that separated the sick infected babies from their infected but asymptomatic nursery mates.
