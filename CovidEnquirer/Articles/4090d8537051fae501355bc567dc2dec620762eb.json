As presented in Table 1 , the median age was 46.0 years and 23871 (51.6%) were men.",

            "text": "cardiovascular diseases, and their susceptibility conditions, may be linked to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Chronic diseases share several standard features with infectious disorders, such as the proinflammatory state, and the attenuation of the innate immune response. For instance, diabetes occurs in part because the accumulation of activated innate immune cells in metabolic tissues leads to the release of inflammatory mediators, especially, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, which promotes systemic insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell damage 17 . Besides, metabolic disorders may lead to low immune function by impairing macrophage and lymphocyte function 18 , which may make individuals more susceptible to disease complications 11 . Recently, Guo et al 19 retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients with viral pneumonia and found J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that the absolute count levels of CD3+ T cell, CD3+ CD8+ T cell and CD3+ CD4+ T cell in the death group were significantly lower than those in the survival group, suggesting that the levels of various inflammatory factors in the death group were higher than those in the survival group. A prospective case control study about seasonal influenza was conducted by Hong et al 20 , Their result showed that diabetes and chronic cardiovascular disease were significantly related to development of complications, and diabetes was an independent risk factor for severe seasonal influenza (odds ration OR: 3.63, 95% CI(1.15-11.51)\uff0cP=0.02). Furthermore, a study analyzed the risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) patients, finding diabetes, Smoking, and heart disease were also significantly associated with MERS-CoV illness 21 . Limitations of this meta-analysis should be addressed. First, the high statistic heterogeneity could be found. This may relate to the study designs and large variation among studies in the sample size (9 to 46248 patients). Second, different lengths of follow-up may miss the event leading to heterogeneity. Owing to some patients are still in hospital in the included studies. Third, because only a few studies compared the comorbidities of severe and Non-severe patients, we did not conduct sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis. If causality exists between chronic diseases and COVID-19, it will help the health sector guide vulnerable populations and assess the risk of deterioration. Lau et al 22 followed up the vaccinations of 91,605 people with diabetes, the results showed that the flu vaccine could make the incidence of influenza and pneumonia in people with diabetes aged (<65 years) decreased by 43%, and diabetes in the elderly (\u226565 years) people fell 55%. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar with those of influenza (e. g, fever, cough or fatigue), and outbreaks occur during the year of a high prevalence of respiratory diseases caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and other respiratory viruses. Vaccines can still be useful in helping prevent flu and will reduce possible confusion with the COVID-19 infection 23 . Hypertension, diabetes, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease period were identified as potentially important risk factors that should be included in future J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f vaccination recommendations. Given the limited level of evidence, more adequately and powered study should be conducted to prove the association. The prevalence of chronic diseases is increasing year by year, targeted public health vaccination interventions must be adopted to better protect people with chronic diseases from COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.
