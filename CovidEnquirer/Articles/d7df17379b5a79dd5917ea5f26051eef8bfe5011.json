A broad band of sub-Saharan Africa north of Namibia and Zambia is at risk (http:// www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/maps/africa.html), as is much of the northern portion of South America (http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/maps/south_america.html).

With a throughput of only 2 to 4 million doses per month, YF vaccine supply is inadequate given the large urban populations at risk for YF infection. In response to such shortage, dose fractionation has been proposed to maximize the public health benefit of the available YF vaccines. 4 Under dose fractionation, a smaller amount of antigen would be used per dose in order to increase the number of persons who can be vaccinated with a given quantity of vaccine. 3 This strategy was previously proposed to extend pre-pandemic influenza vaccine supplies. 5 If dose fractionation were consistently adopted, equity of YF vaccine access would also be enhanced both within and across countries at risk, as more people could benefit from vaccination without depriving others. 6 Indeed, following the SAGE endorsement on 17 June 2016, the WHO recommended dose fractionation in its emergency YF vaccination campaign in July-August 2016 to vaccinate 8 million people in Kinshasa, 3 million in anterior Angola and 4\u00b73 million along the DRC-Angola corridor. 7 Specifically, 2\u00b75 million standard-dose vaccines would be allocated to Kinshasa where 200,000 standard-dose vaccines would be given to children age 9 months to 2 years and the remaining allocation are to be fractionated five-fold and administered to the rest of the population.",

In particular, it is not known whether equal immunogenicity implies equal vaccine efficacy for YF vaccines. Moreover, the findings of equal immunogenicity of reduced doses are limited to healthy adults; no comparable data exist in children (thus the age cutoff of 2 years for fractional-dose vaccines in Kinshasa), elderly or immunocompromised individuals (e.g. HIV-infected people, pregnant women, etc.). As such, while noninferior immunogenicity of fractional-dose vaccines provide a strong basis for an initial consideration of dose-sparing strategies for YF vaccines, it would be prudent to ensure the robustness of this strategy by carefully evaluating the risk and epidemiologic impact of reduced vaccine efficacy in fractional-dose vaccines. Such an evaluation is nontrivial because even if dose fractionation reduces vaccine efficacy, higher vaccine coverage may confer higher herd immunity in which case the number of infections could be significantly reduced by the indirect effect of large-scale vaccination. 12 The lower the transmissibility, the larger the number of infections that can be averted by indirect protection, as illustrated by the previous study of dose fractionation for pre-pandemic influenza vaccines. 5 The importance of herd immunity for YF vaccination is unknown because transmissibility of YF in urban settings has never been adequately characterized due to limited data.",

We find that all dose-sparing strategies considered are likely to provide significant benefit epidemiologically, and that the best policy will be determined by balancing logistical and regulatory considerations against the extent of epidemiologic benefit.

To this end, we use the Wallinga and Teunis method 13 to estimate the reproductive number of YF from the daily number of confirmed YF cases recorded in the 17 April 2016 WHO Angola Situation Report, 14 assuming that all cases were attributed to local transmission (i.e. no importation of cases). When estimating the extrinsic incubation period, we assume that the average temperature in Angola was 28 degrees Celsius during the outbreak. To estimate the serial interval distribution, we make the following assumptions: (i) the extrinsic incubation period follows the Weibull distribution estimated by ref. 15 which has mean 12\u00b77 days at 28 degrees Celsius; (ii) the intrinsic incubation period follows the lognormal distribution estimated by ref. 15 which has mean 4\u00b76 days; (iii) the infectious period in human is exponentially distributed with mean 4 days; 16 (iv) the mosquito lifespan is exponentially distributed with mean 7 to 14 days. 17 We estimate the initial reproductive number of the YF outbreak in Angola as the average reproductive number among all cases who developed symptoms one serial interval before vaccination campaign began to affect disease transmission (see Figure 1 ).",

Under the WHO dose-sparing strategy, 200,000 standard-dose vaccines will be given to children aged between 9 months and 2 years (which is sufficient for vaccinating all unvaccinated children in this age range) and the remaining allocation will be fractionated to one-fifth of the standard dose and given to the rest of the population. We compare the outcome when the vaccines are administered (i) in standard dose only (strategy S) and (ii) according to the WHO dose-sparing strategy with alternative age cutoffs for fractional-dose vaccines ranging from 2 to 20 years (strategy F). For the latter, let Z be the age cutoff and p(Z) be the proportion of population targeted for standard-dose vaccination. For a given standard-dose vaccine coverage V, the proportion of population receiving standard-dose and fractional-dose vaccines are min(V, p(Z)) and 5 max(V \u2212 p(Z), 0), respectively. Therefore, the effective vaccine coverage after the vaccination campaign is B + min(V, p(Z)) \u00b7 VE(1) + 5 max(V \u2212 p(Z), 0) \u00b7 VE(5) where B is the vaccine coverage immediately before the campaign (i.e. at the end of June 2016).

Fractional-dose vaccination substantially reduces IAR if V > 10% and such reduction only diminishes to insignificant levels when V is close to the herd immunity threshold 1\u22121/R 0 (e.g. 75% and 88% for R 0 = 4 and 8, respectively).

Nonetheless, to assess the robustness of the conclusion that dose fractionation is likely to be beneficial, against the possibility that in fact efficacy of fractionated doses is lower than anticipated, we consider the possibility that five-fold fractionated dosing fails to immunize a proportion (1\u2212VE(5)) of recipients. We find that as long as at least 20% of recipients are fully immunized by the vaccine, more people would be immunized by vaccinating five times as many people with one-fifth the dose, and so the population-wide benefits of higher coverage would outweigh the lower efficacy of fractionated dosing for individual vaccinees.",

We assume homogeneous mixing of the population (reasonable at least locally for a vector-borne disease). We also fix a particular value of R 0 for each calculation, and assume this value is maintained until the epidemic has swept through a population. In reality, R 0 will vary seasonally as vector abundance, extrinsic incubation period, and other factors vary. The existence of a hightransmission season might enhance the benefits of fractional-dose vaccination. Most importantly, there will be a premium on achieving high vaccine coverage before the peak of transmission to maximally impact transmission, and this will be limited by supply constraints that could be partially relieved by fractionation. However, the cases-averted estimates might not all be achieved in a single transmission season if seasonal declines in mosquito abundance abrogate transmission before the large majority of the population has become infected.",

For vaccines whose standard formulations exceed WHO minimum concentration of viral particles, 10 this dose fractionation could be accomplished without changing the WHO recommendations.

Visual inspection of the data from a dose fractionation trial of the 17DD vaccine in Brazil shows that for doses down to 47\u00d7 below the standard dose, the distribution of serologic responses was indistinguishable from those for the standard dose, suggesting that efficacy should be nearly equivalent to that for full doses. This was confirmed by the analysis of peak viremia, which was equivalent for standard dose and for doses down to 11% of the full dose (9-fold fractionation). It was further confirmed by peak cytokine responses, which were comparable to the standard dose for all cytokines tested, down to at least a 9-fold fractional dose. For even lower doses, the proportion seroconverting after vaccination was lower than the 97% observed for the full dose, but the antibody response among the seroconverters appears to be similar at all doses. 9 These data collectively suggest that down to approximately 9-fold fractional dosing of this vaccine the response should be equivalent, and that for further fractionation there may be a failure to induce any substantial response in a fraction of recipients, but the neutralizing antibody titres in those who do respond should be comparable. This pattern is consistent with an all-ornothing model. ",
