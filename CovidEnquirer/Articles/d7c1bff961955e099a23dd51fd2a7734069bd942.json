Viral RNA templates for the S-gene amplification were directly extracted from raw clinical samples, including plasma, throat swab, sputum, and stool, during the course of the epidemic in the Beijing area. We used a TAcloning assay with direct analysis of nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products in sequence. One hundred thirteen sequence variations with nine recurrent variant sites were identified in analyzed S-gene sequences compared with the BJ01 strain of SARS-CoV. Among them, eight variant sites were, we think, the first documented. Our findings demonstrate the coexistence of Sgene sequences with and without substitutions (compared to BJ01) in samples analyzed from some patients.",

From March 4 to June 18, Beijing had 2,521 cases and 192 deaths from SARS (4) . Because of the poor fidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, genetic variation typically forms a heterogeneous virus pool in RNA virus populations, including coronaviruses such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (5, 6) . This feature makes viruses highly adaptable and contributes to difficulties in preventing and controlling viral disease. SARS-CoV, a single-stranded RNA virus, has been reported with relatively less variability in analyses of a limited number of viral isolate collections (7) (8) (9) (10) . Furthermore, no SARS-CoV quasispecies have been documented, as they have been in many other RNA viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) (11) , HIV (12) , and MHV (6) .",

For the S-gene amplification, 18 pairs of primers were designed by using MacVactor computer software (Accelrys Inc, San Diego, CA) based on the BJ01 strain of SARS-CoV (GenBank accession no. AY278488) (16) . Among them, six pairs (sense/antisense: S1aF/S1aB, S2aF/S2aB, S3aF/S3aB, S4aF/S4aB, S5aF/S5aB, S6aF/S6aB) were used as outer primers, six pairs (sense/antisense: S1bF/S1bB, S2bF/S2bB, S3bF/S3bB, S4bF/S4bB, S5bF/S5bB, S6bF/S6bB) were used as inner primers, and six pairs (sense/antisense: S1cF/S1cB, S2cF/S2cB, S3cF/S3cB, S4cF/S4cB, S5cF/S5cB, S6cF/S6cB) were designed for direct RT-PCR product sequencing. The sequences covering the fulllength S gene were amplified separately as six overlapping fragments (F1b, F2b, F3b, F4b, F5b, and F6b) ( Figure 1 ). The one-step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) was used for reverse transcription and the first round of PCR amplification with outer primers. Thermal cycling consisted of 50\u00b0C for 30 min; 95\u00b0C for 15 min; 10 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 57.5\u00b0C for 30 s (decreasing by 1.5\u00b0C every other cycle), 72\u00b0C for 1 min; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 54\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 1 min. Afterwards, 2 \u00b5L of the product was used as a template for the second round of PCR amplification in 100-\u00b5L ",

Theoretically, a replicating RNA virus expresses a range of genetic and phenotypic variants and has the potential to generate novel virions, which may be selected in response to environmental pressures. RNA viruses generally tolerate high levels of mutagenesis because of their limited genetic complexity (17) . Mutations have the potential to be pathogenic (e.g., giving the virus immunity to neutralizing antibodies, cytotoxic T cells, or antiviral drugs [18] [19] [20] ). The dynamics of error copying and sequence decomposition are time-dependent. In HIV infection, for example, one adaptive substitution in the env gene occurred every 3.3 months or 25 viral generations, averaging across patients (21) . In our study, a higher variation frequency in the S gene was identified for SARS-CoV compared to previous reports (7) (8) (9) (10) . This difference may be due to a broader sample collection covering a longer timespan of infection. In addition, since virus isolates were not passaged in culture, the whole mutant repertoire is more likely to be detected, since no reverse mutation occurs in cell culture. Our observation most likely reflected the real situation in vivo. Variations were unlikely to result from Taq polymerase errors, since we repeated the experiments for all variations from preparing independent RNA and RT-PCR products and used Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase, which has a high fidelity, to confirm the results in some cases. We could not exclude the possibility that some variations were from defective genomes. However, the fact that the variations remained detectable in the sequences from two or three specimens of the same patient, obtained at different times, suggested that these variations might be active and extensible in vivo.",

Notably, some modules in the S protein remain conserved, e.g., the fusion-important HR domains.
