Detailed evaluations of phenotypic expressions of illness are required to characterize important biological outcomes. We hypothesized that classifying dairy calf mortality phenotypes via a systematic postmortem analysis would identify different cause-of-death diagnoses than those derived from treatments alone. This cross-sectional study was carried out on a dairy calf ranch in the northwestern United States from June to September 2017 and focused on calves \u226490 d of age. Comparisons were made between causes of death based on 3 levels of information: on-farm treatment records alone, necropsy-based postmortem analyses in addition to treatment records, and Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WADDL) results in addition to all other information. A total of 210 dairy calves were necropsied during this study, of which 122 cases were submitted to WADDL. Necropsy-and WADDL-derived mortality phenotypes were in almost perfect agreement (Cohen's \u03ba = 0.86) when broadly categorized as diarrhea, respiratory, diarrhea and respiratory combined, or other causes. The level of agreement between onfarm treatment records and postmortem-derived results was low and varied by the level of diagnostic detail provided. There was just fair agreement (\u03ba = 0.22) between treatment-based and necropsy-based phenotypes without WADDL input and only slight agreement (\u03ba = 0.13) between treatment-based and corresponding necropsy-based phenotypes with WADDL input. Even for those cases in which causes of death aligned along a comparable pathologic spectrum, the lack of detail inherent to standard treatment-based causes of death failed to identify meaningful target areas for intervention. This was especially apparent for numerous cases of necrotizing enteritis and typhlitis (cecal inflammation) that were variously categorized as diarrhea and pneumonia by treatment-based diagnoses. The specificity of these lesions stood in stark contrast to the otherwise generic cause of death diagnoses derived from treatments. The findings from this study supported the hypothesis and highlighted the value of on-farm necropsies and laboratory-based diagnostics to (1) detect antemortem disease misclassifications, (2) provide detail regarding disease processes and mortality phenotypes, and (3) direct disease mitigation strategies.",

It is estimated that over 8% of nulliparous heifers die, with producer-derived surveys implicating infectious calf diarrhea as a cause of more than half (56.4%) of all preweaning calf mortality and respiratory problems as a cause of over half (58.9%) of postweaning deaths (USDA, 2017) . However, diagnostic detail and accuracy is hindered by a lack of necropsies and additional laboratory work-up.

Gulliksen et al. (2009) found that pneumonia was the most common cause of death among 65 necropsied calves on 35 Norwegian dairy farms but that enteritis was the most frequent postmortem diagnoses in the youngest calves. Given that <5% of dead heifers are necropsied in the United States, the reality is that many dairy calf mortalities are poorly categorized, with causes of death based solely upon previous treatment history rather than diagnostic input. The absence of diagnostic input is important because current estimations of the frequency of disease are then dependent upon standard treatment protocols serving as a proxy for unsubstantiated underlying disease. This lack of insight into heifer health problems is a major liability for efforts to accurately record disease phenotypes. Without a clearer understanding of the relationship between treatment and disease, approximations of treatment failures versus diagnostic inaccuracies are left unknown. Ultimately, understanding the timing and fates of animals that die on farms can be informative in their reflection of management conditions and production efficiencies and provide a foundation for improved understanding of animal health and features of farm management that present risks of poor outcomes.",

Time and personnel constraints dictated that necropsies were performed 2 to 3 times per week on up to 10 calves. If more than 10 calves were available for necropsy, a coin flip was used to determine the 10 calves to be necropsied. Only calves that had died the previous night were necropsied in an effort to avoid autolysis due to summer daytime temperatures. Necropsies were performed following a study protocol (Supplemental Figure S1 ; https: / / doi .org/ 10 .3168/ jds .2018 -15527) outlining the standardized procedures for calf necropsies (Severidt et al., 2002) , tissue sampling and tissue submission guidelines, and representative digital images. Once or twice per week, a coin flip was used to identify a subset of up to 6 necropsied calves to be sampled for additional diagnostics at WADDL. The minimum number of calves to be included overall was based on experiential evidence, and data related to diagnostic inaccuracies suggesting that on-farm treatment-based causes of death would agree with WADDL diagnostic results in up to 60% of cases (Gulliksen et al., 2009) . Necropsy-based postmortem findings and WADDL diagnostic results were anticipated to have no less than 80% agreement. These potential differences suggested that a minimum sample size of 82 cases (compared against themselves) would allow for detection of at least a 20% difference in classification agreement with a power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05. Necropsies were performed initially by the on-farm veterinarians and principal investigator (CSM), with help from 2 undergraduate summer interns. Within 2 wk of the study's commencement, the interns performed necropsies with or without a veterinarian present following the prescribed protocols. For all cases, a set of standard digital images was taken, demonstrating both thoracic and abdominal cavities. Additional images were taken to highlight specific pathologies and irregularities of interest. All images were uploaded into a group messenger application for smartphones (2017 WhatsApp Inc.; https: / / www .whatsapp .com/ ) and delivered to participating investigators for comment and discussion regarding lesions and relevant historical attributes. Images related to cases submitted to WADDL for further diagnostics were catalogued electronically at Washington State University for evaluation by the veterinary pathologists on record.",

On-farm necropsybased diagnoses were formulated with input from interns, on-farm veterinarians, and the principal investigator. The WADDL-based diagnoses were determined on a case-by-case basis by the pathologist of record following completion of ancillary diagnostics including histopathology. Resultant mortality phenotypes were then categorized broadly by the principal investigator for each of the 3 levels of information according to a modified categorization scheme for dairy calf causes of death using a calf death loss flowchart ( Figure 1 ; Lombard et al., 2019) . Although no information was available from the time of parturition, a category for calving problems was included to appropriately document trauma such as fractured ribs or pathology due to apparent hypoxic changes such as centrilobular hepatic necrosis within calves \u226448 h of age. Aside from those calves with lesions apparently associated with calving problems or due to a congenital defect or accident, all deaths \u226424 h of age were assigned to a postnatal death category as per the flowchart. Postmortem evaluations of the postnatal deaths provided insight into whether the underlying cause of death was something more specific than an ill-defined maladaptation to life. Additional categories for causes of death were as follows and depended upon the relevant treatments, timing and phenotypic expression of disease or injury: accident, diarrhea, diarrhea and respiratory, respiratory, joint or navel, lameness or injury, other digestive, other known reasons, and unknown reason.",

For example, a case of bronchopneumonia had the same underlying cause of death (respiratory) listed across sources even though the extent of disease only could be exposed through postmortem analysis. Compare this to a case of necrotizing, ulcerative typhlitis (cecal inflammation) variably categorized as diarrhea, diarrhea and respiratory, and other digestive for treatment-, necropsy-, and WADDL-based mortality phenotypes, respectively. Although the underlying issue was demonstrably aligned along a comparable pathologic spectrum ranging from diarrhea to sepsis, each diagnostic level identified novel phenotypic expressions of illness and death (e.g., lung pathology, intestinal necrosis and ulcerative lesions, peritonitis) that ultimately led to reclassifications of the cause of death.",

Informative phenotypic detail across the spectrum of dairy calf death categories was provided by postmortem evaluations founded on necropsies with input from WADDL when available (Table 3) . Aside from the specific lesions and infectious agents detailed within the \"other digestive\" category, most cases assigned to the other broad categories also benefited from insight into aspects of disease progression, severity, duration, and infection. For example, enterocolitis could be found across categories (diarrhea, diarrhea and respiratory, other digestive), but associated pathology (e.g., bronchopneumonia, peritonitis, septicemia) and level of severity (e.g., mild, suppurative, ulcerative) ultimately dictated how a case aligned within the calf death loss categorization scheme. The specificity of the mortality phenotypes stood in stark contrast to the otherwise generic cause of death diagnoses derived from treatments alone and provided meaningful insight into pathophysiological processes capable of informing therapeutic and preventive practices. This held true even for those cases that were assigned to the postnatal death category as a straightforward function of the timing of death (\u226424 h of age). Specific pathologic findings and infections still spoke to consequential problems beyond an ill-defined maladaptation to life. In fact, postmortem evaluations were informative even for the 1% (3/210) of cases for which a cause of death remained unknown, to the extent that the findings documented the absence of specific issues of concern.",

Necropsies are warranted when morbidity or mortality exceeds historic or comfortable levels, when there is a perceived treatment failure, for acquiring information necessary for confirmation of a tentative clinical diagnosis, when presenting signs are dramatic or unusual, or to characterize a disease process when no antemortem observation has been made (Mason and Madden, 2007; Thomsen et al., 2012) . Information derived from a necropsy and associated diagnostics should be viewed in conjunction with background information related to management factors such as the nutritional regimen, and clinical history, including treatments, to form a systematic postmortem evaluation. The findings from this study support the hypothesis that classifying dairy calf mortality phenotypes via a systematic postmortem analysis can identify differences in cause-of-death diagnoses compared with those derived from treatments alone. Differences in the characterization of underlying pathologies highlighted the value of on-farm necropsies and laboratory-based diagnostics to (1) detect antemortem disease misclassifications, (2) provide detail regarding disease processes and mortality phenotypes, and (3) direct disease mitigation strategies related to prevention and treatment.",

This categorization scheme is particularly useful in that it discriminates between uncomplicated diarrhea and other specific digestive ailments such as GI ulceration and peritonitis, and acknowledges the fact that many calf deaths present with ante-and postmortem evidence suggestive of both GI and lung pathology. In total, treatment-based records attributed 65% (137) of the 210 deaths evaluated in this study to diarrhea with or without respiratory problems, and 16% (34) were attributed to respiratory disease alone. Only 4% (8) had an unknown reason for the cause of death based on treatment records. Given that this study was 97% (203) populated with preweaning calves \u226460 d of age, these findings are similar to results from the USDA National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS)",

Disease processes operate along a continuum with the potential to affect multiple organ systems and manifest across the clinical spectrum. Without the benefit of information provided by necropsies as part of systematic postmortem evaluations, it is difficult to ascribe meaningful detail to causes of death. As demonstrated within the current study, the additional detail allowed for scrutiny of antemortem diagnostic accuracy and clarification of phenotypic expressions of illness and death. This was especially apparent concerning the surprising number of cases of necrotizing, ulcerative enterocolitis and typhlitis that particularly reduced agreement between levels of information ( Table 2 ). The clinical presentations and treatment regimens documented for those cases belied the specificity and severity of the pathophysiologic causal pathway. Without the detail provided by extensive postmortem evaluations that integrate gross, histological, and microbiological findings, those cases would have been relegated to categories that failed to acknowledge the particular pathology. As with human cases of necrotizing enterocolitis, the exact role of microbes in bovine cases remains incompletely understood and the apparent dysbiosis associated with the lesions certainly does not imply cause and effect (Coggins et al., 2015; Adaska et al., 2017) . However, the notion that a specific pathogen such as Rotavirus might have played a role in a rarely identified pattern of lesions potentially linked to stress-induced metabolic, immunologic, and microbial GI disturbances (Mitchell et al., 1981; Aoki-Yoshida et al., 2016) provides support for additional nutritional, therapeutic, and diagnostic investigations.",

Nonetheless, the postmortem evaluation as a whole proved informative for the majority of cases and provided insight into many deaths that would otherwise have remained poorly or inaccurately classified.

The inclusion of salient postmortem information can describe the causal pathway in such a way as to educate management moving forward. Describing the process leading to a death and mortality phenotype helps provide a narrative with the ability to convey complex and multi-layered ideas in a simple and memorable form to culturally diverse audiences. The power of the causal narrative is its ability to stimulate interest in a problem, facilitate learning, influence communication and cross-cultural under- standing, and drive change within a farm (Snowden, 1999 (Snowden, , 2000a . Formulating a narrative based on systematic postmortem evaluations therefore provides an avenue for exploring common sense solutions to otherwise complex problems, and affords an opportunity for real-time intervention in the form of employee education. Rather than viewing an individual calf death as a demoralizing end-point, the narrative provides an understanding from which to elicit change across the population. Rearing dairy replacement heifers should focus on limiting environmental impact, protecting animal welfare, and minimizing required inputs while returning the most profitable outputs (Hoffman and Funk, 1992; Heinrichs et al., 2017) . As such, reducing economic costs and impairment to animal welfare through improved understanding of dairy calf mortality provides a critical control point for accelerating whole-farm efficiency and sustainability.",

The NAHMS Dairy 2014 study indicated that very few (<5%) dead heifers are necropsied as part of a postmortem examination. Yet without information provided from postmortem examinations, a dairy calf health management team is limited in their assessment of outcomes related to antemortem clinical diagnoses and treatments. Rather than wading through the complexities of treatment records and making decisions founded on speculation, evidence-based veterinary medicine would suggest that necropsies and additional laboratory-based diagnostics should be used as part of a systematic postmortem examination of dairy heifer causes of death.",
