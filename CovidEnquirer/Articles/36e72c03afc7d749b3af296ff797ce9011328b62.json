It was named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and WHO issued a global alert about the disease on March 13, 2003. 5,6 SARS outbreaks occurred in South-East Asia, North America, and Europe, and gave rise to the first pandemic of the 21st century.",

Four patients required mechanical ventilation. 2 The second wave-since Jan 12, 2003, some complicated SARS cases from the neighbouring cities were transferred to the major hospitals in Guangzhou for better medical care. The index community SARS case of Guangzhou was a 46-year-old male seafood merchant who was admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan University on Jan 31, 2003. He had travelled to Zhongshan in mid-January. The patient stayed in the hospital for only 18 h, but caused more than 30 hospital staff to become infected. On Feb 1, 2003, the Guangzhou index patient was transferred to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan University. During the transfer, the ambulance driver, two doctors, and two nurses were infected. Within the next 8 days, 20 more medical staff who had been in contact with the patient became infected. At the same time, 19 family members or relatives of the patient fell ill with similar clinical manifestations after close personal contact with the patient. This patient generated a large cluster of secondary infections that further spread and gave rise to the outbreak in Guangzhou. In mid-February, one doctor working at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan travelled to Hong Kong, and became the major source of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, which led on to the pandemic. 4 D e c 2 9 , 2 0 0 2 D e c 3 1 , 2 0 0 2 J a n 2 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 4 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 6 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 8 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 1 0 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 1 2 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 1 4 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 1 6 , 2 0 0 3 J a n All patients had high fever (>38\u00b0C) lasting for a mean of 11 days (SD 6\u00b78), and developed pneumonia within 1-4 days of admission.

A few had other mild respiratory infection symptoms, such as cough and sore throat. Radiography confirmed the diagnosis of pneumonia in all patients.

So, all samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate were recultured on FRhK-4 cells. Positive cytopathic effect was noted in three samples after the inoculation. All three isolates were confirmed to be SARS CoV by RT-PCR and sequencing PCR products with specific primers. 12 The three viruses were isolated from specimens from a 36-year-old female health-care worker (GZ43), a 49-year-old female clerk (GZ50), and a 39-year-old male health-care worker (GZ60).

Serological tests and virus isolation confirmed that SARS CoV was the primary infectious agent of these early cases of SARS. Genetic analysis of these SARS CoV isolates showed that they belonged to two different subgroups, one closely related to that noted in Hong Kong and other countries, and one that seemingly had not spread to people in other regions.

The findings of our study show that most of the patients had serological evidence of infection with the novel SARS CoV, while healthy controls did not. Information generated here suggests that SARS CoV was also the primary infectious agent in the outbreaks in Guangdong Province. Because most people who had SARS in other countries were directly or indirectly linked to Hong Kong or Guangdong Province, we believe that the coronavirus might have originated from this region. Thus, SARS, a new emerging infectious disease that has become the first pandemic of the 21st century, probably originated in Guangdong. [7] [8] [9] [10] Our epidemiological findings suggest that SARS had been spreading in an unusual pattern. The pandemic began with just a few index cases clustered mainly in families and hospital health-care workers in cities around Guangzhou. That specific antibodies were not present in any serum samples from healthy controls suggests that this coronavirus has not previously been present in human beings in Guangzhou.",

This finding suggests that there were multiple lineages of viruses circulating in Guangdong. One of these lineages (GZ50) maintains an outgroup relation to the major cluster of cases in Hong Kong and could represent the precursor virus of the Hong Kong outbreak. Whether some lineages are more transmissible than others is not clear. 1 An analysis of more strains from Guangdong are needed to address this issue. The spread of SARS CoV in Foshan and Zhongshan in November and December, 2002, did not lead to an outbreak of the same scale as that in Guangzhou in January and February, 2003. Foshan and Zhongshan, like Guandong, are large urban conurbations of more than 1 million people. One possibility is that the virus was adapting to human beings-ie, human transmission with time. However, spread of the disease might have been promoted by the movement of people during the Chinese New Year holiday season that, in 2003, occurred at the end of January. Furthermore, Guangzhou, being a premier medical centre, received transfers of several patients with respiratory complications associated with SARS.",

Retrospective analysis of the pathway of the SARS spread from satellite cities to Guangzhou, then Hong Kong and other countries, showed that the major outbreak around the world could be linked to just a small number of so called super-spreading incidents. This finding implies that effective human-to-human transmission is firmly established and suggests that SARS CoV has become well adapted to human beings. 16 One important question that has arisen from the SARS outbreak is why the new coronavirus emerged in Guangdong, southern China. There might be a link to the culinary habits of some southern Chinese who consume wild game meat as a delicacy. To satisfy this demand, different kinds of wild animals have been hunted for consumption, or raised in captivity. These animals are a likely source of new emergent infectious disease to human beings. In fact, the emergence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in humans in 1997 18, 19 and in early 2003 (unpublished data) is also zoonotic. The SARS outbreak provides evidence to support the hypothesis that southern China could be a site for emerging pandemic infectious disease in the future. 20 The investigation of the infectious agent in SARS emphasises the importance of international collaboration as an effective strategy to control emerging diseases in people, especially for those diseases with the potential to become pandemic. The lesson from SARS outbreaks associated with coronavirus is that we cannot ignore or underestimate the effect of a new emerging infectious disease. The best way to control a new emerging infection is to intervene at an early stage in the outbreak.",

The outbreak was characterised by infection within hospitals and family clusters, suggesting that transmission arises through close contact with infected patients. By April 20, 2003, 1317 SARS cases and 48 deaths had been reported. 1 Clinical features Characteristics of 55 patients with SARS who acquired the disease between Jan 24, and Feb 18, 2003, are shown in table 1. 18 cases were transferred from neighbouring cities of Guangzhou during outbreaks from December, 2002, to January, 2003. About half (49%) of infected people in our study group were health-care workers, mainly from two hospitals, and the group who were infected during the transfer of the first index SARS case of Guangzhou.
