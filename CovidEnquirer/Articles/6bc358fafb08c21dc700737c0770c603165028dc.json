An oligonueleotide with a completely degenerate sequence of 17 or 23 nucleotides was inserted into a bacterial expression vector. This resulted in an expression library producing random hexa-or octapeptides attached to a fl-galactosidase hybrid protein. Mimotopes, or antigenic sequences that mimic an epitope, were selected by immur.oscteening of colonies with monoclonal antibodies, which were specific for antigenic sites on the spike protein of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus. We report one mimotope for antigenic site II, eight for site I!I and one for site IV. The site I!1 and site IV mimotopes were closely similar to the corresponding linear epitopes, localized previously in the amino acid sequence of the S protein. An alignment of the site II mimotope and the sequence of the S protein around Trp97, which is substituted in escape mutants, suggests that this mimotope mimics a conformational epitope located around residues 97-103. Applications of mimotopes to epitope mapping, serodiagnosis and vaccine development are discussed.",

These peptides, so-called mimotopes, can be found by a systematic ab initio approach without using the primary structure of the antigen. First, the binding of all po~ible (400) dipeptides to the mAb is tested with the mAb of choice, then the most antigenic dipeptides are selected to synthesize tripeptides, and so on. This has led to the construction of a hexapeptide that was recognized specifically by a mAb against foot-and-mouth-disease virus. However, this procedure was rather time-consuming, while it was not entirely clear how this mimotope was related to the actual antibody-binding site on the virus. A similar approach has been used by Houghten et al. (1991) .",

The epitopes recognized by these antibodies had been mapped previously using bacterial fusion proteins, PEPSCAN analysis and escape mutants (Correa et al., 1989; Posthumus et al., 1990a,b; Gebauer et al., 1991) . We obtained ten mimotopes specific for the viral epitopes, one of which was conformational.

The nonneutralizing site IV specific mAbs 57.51 and 1D.G3 recognized overlapping sequences in the same region (Posthumus et al., 1990b) . Screening with the neutralizing mAb 57.9 yielded one mimotope. This mimotope was also recognized by the neutralizing mAbs 57.24 and 57.99, but not by the nonneutralizing mAb 57.51 (Fig. 2) . Alignment of this mimotope with the 380-387 sequence (Fig. 3) again shows a close resemblance: the mimotope contains not only the three essential residues Phe382, Ser383 and Giy385, but also conforms to the allowable substitutions at positions 381 and 384.",

In principle, it obviates the synthesis of peptides and the cloning of gene fragments in an expression plasmid. Several mAbs can be combined during the primary screen and can be tested separately at a later stage. Likewise, positives selected by polyclonai antisera can be grouped by the immune-selection procedure (Stanley et al., 1987) . Furthermore, it may be of fundamental interest that this method provides an elegant approach to measuring the selectivity of a given antibody.",

Scientifically challenging as this may be there are a few caveats. Firstly, one should discriminate between structural and antigenic equivalence. Mimotopes are constructed or selected by satisfying the binding requirements of one particular antibody. Consequently, a mimotope may be a reconstruction of the antigenic surface that is biased by only one antibody rather than a realistic representation. In fact, we have observed that the mimotopes of sites II and 1V from TGEV are not recognized by mAbs specific for other epitopes within the same site.",

Thirdly, antigenic equivalence (recognition by the same antibody or antibodies) does not necessarily imply immunogenic equivalence (induction of the same antibodies). Posthumus et al.
