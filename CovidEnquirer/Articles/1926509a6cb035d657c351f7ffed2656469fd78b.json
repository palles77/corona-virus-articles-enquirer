More recently, the varicella vaccine has further reduced the risk of ADEM.

However, infection is limited to cells of macrophage origin. In the brain, macrophages and microglia appear to release a cytokine or similar soluble substance that results in demyelination (Kennedy et al., 1985) . A related lentivirus, human immunodeWciency virus (HIV), has subsequently been shown to infect the same restricted cell population in the human brain.

Molecular mimicry, in which an immune response to an environmental agent cross-reacts with a host antigen, has been a popular postulated mechanism. A similar amino acid sequence contained in both viral protein and myelin proteins might allow systemic virus replication to induce an immune response against an epitope on the CNS myelin. Searching sequence databases for commonality of encephalitogenic sequences of myelin basic protein and viral proteins turned up a sequence within the P protein of hepatitis B virus. Inoculation of this synthesized viral sequence into rabbits resulted in an inXammatory response in the brain (Fujinami and Oldstone, 1985) . In natural infections, Camphylobactor infections followed by the axonal form of Guillian-Barre syndrome are probably due to similarities between bacterial and axonal proteins (Moran and Prendergast, 2001) , and cellular damage in HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (tropical spastic paraparesis) appears related, in part, to homology between nuclear ribonuclear neuronal protein and the tax protein of HTLV-1 (Levin et al., 2002) .",

Subsequent studies showed inhibition of lymphocyte responses to mitogens for up to 4 weeks after uncomplicated measles virus infection. The magnitude of inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation was the same in children with uncomplicated measles, in those with pneumonitis related to immunodeWciency, and in those with ADEM thought to be due to an autoimmune response (Hirsch et al., 1984) .

The mechanisms underlying the profound suppression of cell-mediated immunity accompanying measles is still not fully understood. In vitro infection of human monocytes speciWcally down-regulates IL-12 production, a cytokine critical in cell-mediated immunity (Karp et al., 1996) , however disruption at other sites in the complex cytokine network is likely.",

The most frequent fatal complications of measles, pneumonitis, gastroenteritis, and secondary bacterial infections, result from a depression of cell-mediated immune responses extending for 1 to 4 weeks after the rash. Prior to the emergence of HIV, measles virus was the most important and lethal causes of a virus-induced immunodeWciency syndrome. However, the major neurological complication of measles infection, ADEM, was assumed to be an allergic or autoimmune disease.

Thus, populations such as those of West Africa tend to suVer high rates of measles mortality from opportunistic infections and infant deaths. On the other hand, more aVluent countries without adequate immunization programs have greater mortality and morbidity from post-measles encephalitis, because older children become infected. Although polyneuritis, toxic encephalopathy and acute hemiplegia of possible vascular etiology have been reported with measles, over 95% of the neurological illnesses are represented by ADEM. The incubation period of measles is 10 to 14 days. The prodrome and period of infectivity is marked by coryza, conjunctivitis, cough, and the pathognomonic Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa. Coincident with the antibody response and the end of infectivity, a maculopapular rash develops on the face and trunk, later spreading to the extremities. Virus can be recovered from the rash, and for up to 5 days after the appearance of the rash, viral antigen or RNA can be found in epithelioid cells of the lung, gut, bladder, and lymphoid organs (Moench et al., 1988) . On rare occasions, viral antigen and RNA can also be detected in cerebrovascular endothelial cells (Esolen et al., 1995) . Although there is no evidence of infection of neural cells, approximately 50% of children have an abnormal electroencephalogram during the rash (Gibbs et al., 1959) , and approximately 30% have a pleocytosis (Ojala, 1947) .",

Fortunately, mumps is not highly neurovirulent, and the common neurological complication is benign meningitis. In patients with mumps meningitis, virus can readily be isolated from spinal Xuid, and viral nucleocapsids can be visualized by electron microscopy within ependymal cells found in spinal Xuid . This suggests a similar pathogenesis of CNS invasion in humans as seen in hamsters, where mumps virus selectively infects ependymal cells (Johnson, 1968) . Serious CNS complications of mumps virus infections are rare. Even prior to immunization, when mumps virus infection was universal, only four to Wve deaths from mumps encephalitis were reported to the Centers for Disease Control each year.

The Wnding of viral DNA by PCR is not meaningful, since EB virus is latent in B lymphocytes and a single B cell traversing through cerebral circulation or drifting into spinal Xuid could give a positive signal. As with mumps virus infections, intrathecal antibody synthesis and oligoclonal bands of IgG in the spinal Xuid may be found; this is in contrast to post-measles encephalomyelitis but does not exclude an immunopathological mechanism.

Although the cause was ruled to be a result of leukemic cells that had inWltrated the brain, post-mortem examination revealed bizarre, enlarged nuclei and demyelination, which was not consistent with the diagnosis. A few years later, another patient with CLL developed similar neurologic symptoms. Again, autopsy revealed demyelinated plaques populated by cells with enlarged, dense nuclei, which were hypothesized to be oligodendrocytes with an unusual, undescribed pathology. The results were published in 1958 as the Wrst clinical and neuropathological description of a new disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), also known as Richardson's disease after E. P. Richarson, who was responsible for the initial description (Astrom et al., 1958) . There were early suspicions that PML was caused by a virus; however, the etiologic agent was not identiWed until 1971 as the human polyomavirus, JC Virus. Like other polyomaviruses, JCV was named after the initials of the patient from whom virus was Wrst isolated (Padgett et al., 1971) Initially the disease was mainly associated with patients suVering from lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative diseases such as CLL, Hodgkin's disease, and sarcoidosis (Richardson, 1974) . Following the description of PML, retrospective review of the literature uncovered several similar accounts in patients with dementia suVering from a variety of underlying immunosuppressive disorders. The accounts dated back as far as 1930 with pathologic features consistent with PML (Hallervorden, 1930) . PML is almost exclusively associated with an underlying cellular immunodeWciency. Prior to the AIDS epidemic, the association was most frequently observed in patients with Hodgkin's disease and CLL. In the decades following, the exponential rise in the incidence of AIDS resulted in a much larger and rapidly growing population of immunosuppressed individuals. Presently, PML has become an increasingly common complication in AIDS patients, and has been the AIDS deWning illness in approximately 1% of the cases. It is expected that approximately 4 to 5% of all AIDS patients will eventually develop this disease (Berger and Major, 1999) .",

The complete genome is a closed, circular supercoiled structure, approximately 5.13 kb in length (Frisque et al., 1984) . Transcription occurs in both directions starting from the highly conserved origin of replication, marked by a single EcoR1 restriction site. Extensive sequencing data has revealed that the genome can be functionally divided into three regions: the early region, encoding two nonstructural proteins; the late region, encoding three capsid proteins; and the regulatory region. The early region, located on the proximal side of the origin, is transcribed and expressed early after viral entry. Counterclockwise transcription of this region starting from the EcoR1 site, followed by diVerential splicing, produces two major mRNA species encoding the Large T and small t antigens. It is known that Large T is a nonstructural, DNA binding protein with multiple functions (Fanning, 1992) , one of which is the initiation of JC viral DNA replication by the unwinding and separation of the two strands of DNA so that the polymerases can function. Furthermore, it autoregulates to prevent transcription of the early genes during the later stages of infection, when the structural genes are being produced. Large T also plays a part in the malignant transformation of cells by binding to cell cycle regulatory proteins as well as tumor suppressors such as p53 and pRB, resulting in cellular malignant transformation.",

Clockwise transcription from the origin of replication yields the capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3, as well as the Agnoprotein. VP1, VP2, and VP3, as discussed earlier, are the structural proteins that make up the viral capsid. Agnoprotein in related viruses has been implicated in DNA binding and localization of VP1 to the nucleus (Cole, 1996, Carswell and Alwine, 1986) . A recent report describing the presence of JCV agnoprotein in the cytoplasm of infected cells, suggests that protein shuttles freely between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and is important for JCV proliferation (Okada et al., 2001) . Early gene expression must take place before viral DNA replication can proceed, since the early products, Large T and small t, are necessary for the expression of the late gene products. Thus, eYcient expression of those late structural proteins occurs only after viral transcription and translation have taken place. The noncoding sequences located between the early and late genes contain the origin of replication, the JCV promoter, and enhancer sequences. Collectively, this area is also known as the viral regulatory region (RR), thought to control host range for lytic infection.",

It has been shown that in cell culture systems, human glial cells are the most susceptible to infection as well as the most conducive to virion production (Wroblewska et al., 1980) . It was originally hypothesized that the Large T viral protein deWned the neurotropism of JCV, since the virus was shown to be able to replicate in nonglial cell types only in the presence of JCV or SV40 Large T protein, both of which share signiWcant homology (Feigenbaum et al., 1987) . Subsequent studies interchanged the JCV promoter with other viral promoters and used the constructs to infect various cell types. The results have suggested that the cell type speciWcity of JCV may also be a function of the viral promoter (Feigenbaum et al., 1992) . The restricted growth in cell types from extra neural tissue such as kidney and tonsil has led to questions regarding the nature of JCV susceptibility. Is JCV host cell restriction at the level of binding and entry or is it at the molecular level? The recent identiWcation of the speciWc cell surface receptor for JCV has provided some answers to these questions (Liu et al., 1998) . The receptor, an a 2-6 linked sialic acid, is a commonly expressed ganglioside found on the surface of various cells. Indeed, binding studies of JCV have shown that the virus can bind to and enter numerous cell types via this receptor, both susceptible and nonsusceptible.",

The focus has now shifted to intracellular factors that may contribute to the speciWcity of this virus. The regulatory region of JCV has several binding sites for the NF1 family of transcription factors. A comparison of relative NF1 expression between highly susceptible cells from the human fetal brain (HFB) and a nonsusceptible epithelial cell line (HeLa), demonstrated that one class in particular, NF1-D, was elevated in the HFB cells (Sumner et al., 1996) . Further studies have shown that overexpression of NF1-D in a normally nonpermissive cell line can render the cells susceptible to JCV infection, as determined by early and late gene production (Monaco et al., 2001) . The regulatory region of this virus has been of much interest, because it is becoming increasingly clear that despite eVective virus binding or the presence of viral DNA in the cells, productive infection only occurs in the cell types that express the appropriate transcriptional factors. The very narrow host range and the cell type speciWcity of JCV are unique properties of this virus.",

However, since the technology required to make a deWnitive diagnosis of PML may not readily be available in such areas, the actual incidence of this disease may be masked to some extent. As such, the entire worldwide incidence of PML has not yet been determined. However, serological studies of human polyomaviruses in geographically isolated regions have yielded much information on the natural distribution of JCV in human populations. The Wrst study published in 1973 described a random sampling of 406 individuals from the state of Wisconsin, screened for the presence of JCV antibodies. The results showed that approximately 70% of assayed individuals had signiWcant antibody titers to JCV in their blood. However, the percentage dropped dramatically in very young children, suggesting that initial infection and seroconversion most likely occurs during early childhood (Padgett and Walker, 1973) . Much larger studies were conducted shortly thereafter to study the worldwide distribution of human polyomaviruses. Again, JCV infection was prevalent worldwide, as demonstrated by the presence of antibodies in infected individuals. The majority of adolescents and a much higher percentage of adults (80%) showed elevated levels of JCV-speciWc antibodies (Brown et al., 1975,Walker and Padgett, 1983) .",

Seroepidemiologial studies have proven that the majority of the healthy, human population has antibodies against the virus, although the percentage drops in very young children. Thus, it is postulated that initial infection and seroconversion occurs within the Wrst 6 years of life with no associated clinical symptoms. The initial route of infection remains elusive, although one study has reported JCV replication in human tonsillar tissue, implicating a site of latency and also a primary infection route via inhalation (Monaco et al., 1998) . TraYcking B lymphocytes (Tornatore et al., 1992) may then carry the virus from the tonsillar and stromal tissue to other latent sites, including the bone marrow, tonsils, colon epithelial cells, and kidney (Jensen and Major, 1999; Laghi et al., 1999) (Fig. 40.3) . It is well documented that the virus is excreted in the urine of healthy individuals as well as patients with PML (Agostini et al., 1996) . Transmission via this route is unlikely, however, because the predominant genotype found in urine isolates has not be shown to be able to cause a robust infection in any type of human cell (Ault, 1997) . Systemic circulation of the virus to these diVerent compartments is thought to be via a hematogenous route, most likely involving infected B lymphocytes. Lymphocytes may shuttle the virus across the blood brain barrier during a period of severe immune deWciency, which sets the stage for the onset of PML when JCV infection is passed from the lymphocytes to the highly susceptible glial cell population.",

They can range in size from millimeters to centimeters in diameter, occasionally coalescing to form even larger lesions. The lesions have been identiWed throughout the white matter of the brain, including the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, medulla, and even spinal cord. However, lesions are most commonly located in the subcortical white matter, near the gray-white matter junction, which is an area of increased cerebral blood Xow. This lends support to the hypothesis of viral entry into the CNS via hematogenous dissemination. However, lesions do not follow the cerebral vasculature of the brain. Microscopic examination of the plaques shows lytic destruction of oligodendrocytes, myelin degradation, but sparing of the associated axons. Active viral replication and capsid formation in infected oligodendrocytes is followed by cytolysis and viral release to surrounding cells. Susceptible cell types will follow the same pattern, resulting in a lesion where infected oligodendrocytes are concentrated at the periphery, encroaching outwards as the lesion grows. Thus, JCV is disseminated by cell-to-cell contact. Oligodendrocytes can be found throughout the lesion, often with enlarged, basophilic nuclei. Astrocytes found in this area may be hypertrophied and severely enlarged, while neurons are typically spared. In some cases, lipid-laden macrophages have been identiWed in the center of the lesions as well, evidence of active myelin degradation.",

These investigations began after World War II when Dean (1970) observed that the majority of patients with MS in South Africa were immigrants from the United Kingdom or Northern Europe, even though they made up less that 10% of the population. He determined a prevalence of 50 per 100,000 in this population, compared with 11 per 100,000 in native born English-speaking South Africans, 3 per 100,000 in white Africaans speaking natives, and absence of MS in black, native-born South Africans. Further analysis showed that migration prior to age 15 years led to a risk similar to that of native born English South Africans; and migration as an adult resulted in a risk similar to that of the country of origin (Dean and Kurtzke, 1971) . Similar risk of early life exposure for migrants have been reported from Israel, Australia, Hawaii, and the Antilles. Recent studies of migrants from the United Kingdom and Ireland to varied latitudes in Australia showed prevalence in migrants was considerably less than their country of origin, but did not show a shift at age 15, suggesting that environmental factors may operate over a period of many years and not only in childhood (Hammond et al., 2000) . Studies of migrants from low risk regions to high risk regions suggest a similar phenomenon but are less complete.",

No cases of MS were documented prior to 1943; then 16 patients had onsets between 1943 and 1949 with three subsequent waves of cases. The onset of the initial outbreak coincided with the British occupation of the islands from 1940 to 1945, and detailed analysis showed a spatial relationship between villages where MS patients lived and where British troops had been quartered.

All cases contained at least one active lesion with inXammation, macrophages with myelin debris, and demyelination. CD3 T cells, macrophages, and occasional plasma cells characterized all patterns, but in some cases the demyelination was perivenular and in others not. Some had plaques with sharp margins, others were ill-deWned. In some, oligodendrocytes persisted in demyelinated foci and remyelination was evident, in others apoptosis of oligodendrocytes was associated with wider loss of myelin associated glycoprotein.

Subsequently other studies showed higher titers and intrathecal synthesis of antibodies to a variety of other viruses, but never with the magnitude or consistency of measles antibodies (Tab. 40.4) . In one study, 23% of patients with MS had disproportionately high antibodies to 2 or more viruses in the spinal Xuid (Norrby et al., 1974) ; in another study one patient was reported who had evidence of intrathecal synthesis of antibody to 11 diVerent viruses (Salmi et al., 1983) .

One group reported immunocytochemical staining in 90% of sections showing active demyelinating lesions and only 13% in tissue sections free of active disease (Knox et al., 2000) ; this level of sensitivity and speciWcity is unique among reports. Recently elevated serum and spinal Xuid levels of membrane cofactor protein CD46 were reported in MS patients; this is important because CD46 is a receptor for HHV6 (as well as measles, the traditionally most implicated virus) and is a regulator of the complement cascade involved in antibody mediated immunopathology (Soldan et al., 2001) . This provocative Wnding may lead to new mechanisms by which viruses might evoke in immune-mediated diseases.",

Comparisons to ERVs of apes and old world monkeys suggest that some entered our genome 25 million years ago (Voisset et al., 1999) .

PCR was positive in 97% compared to 18% in control patients. Spinal Xuid IgG directed against the bacterium was found in 97%, compared to 18% with other neurological diseases (Sriram et al., 1999) . Subsequently they reported that oligoclonal bands in spinal Xuids of patients with MS not only reacted with C. pneumoniae antigens (116 of 17 patients) but could be partially or completely adsorbed by antigens (Yao et al., 2001) . A large number of contradictory reports have followed. Some have been conWrmatory to some facets, but none with the high percentages of the initial report; the majority have been negative A recent report, for example, using PCR detected C. pneumoniae in spinal Xuid of 21% of MS patients, in 43% of patients with other neurological diseases, and in no healthy controls (GieVers et al., 2001) . This would suggest that inXammatory responses that recruit macrophages into the spinal Xuid, where under normal circumstances they are not found, can carry in C. pneumonia. Better standardization of both cultivation and PCR methods are needed before fair comparisons of studies can be made.",

The resulting viral infections can result in a wide variety of clinical and pathological symptoms. While some viruses may cause widespread inXammation and neurodegeneration, other viruses may remain latent in the CNS and only produce pathological changes during reactivation. Viral induced demyelination can occur both from direct infection of the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, as in PML, or by indirect mechanisms that have yet to be determined. The Wnal outcome of a viral CNS infection will depend not only on viral characteristics, but also the interaction between virus and host cell. Understanding factors such as immune modulation and host cell regulation of viral gene expression could improve current methods of diagnosis or even lead to innovative methods for therapeutic intervention.",
