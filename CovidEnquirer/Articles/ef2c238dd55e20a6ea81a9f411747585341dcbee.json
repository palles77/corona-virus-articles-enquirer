However, murine-derived monoclonal antibodies may cause an immunogenic response in human patients, reducing their therapeutic efficacy. Chimeric and humanized antibodies have been developed that are less likely to provoke an immune reaction in human patients than are murine-derived antibodies. Antibody fragments, bispecific antibodies, and antibodies produced through the use of phage display systems and genetically modified plants and animals may aid researchers in developing new uses for monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of disease. Monoclonal antibodies may have a number of promising potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of asthma, autoimmune diseases, cancer, poisoning, septicemia, substance abuse, viral infections, and other diseases.",

Since that time, many MAbs have been developed for use in diagnostic procedures and in immunotherapy. Ever since it was observed that the therapeutic use of heterologous MAbs elicited immunogenic responses in humans, significant research efforts have been devoted toward creating chimeric and humanized antibodies for use in human patients. Major achievements have been in the production of MAbs in transgenic plants and animals. The use of phage display libraries has created customized antibodies with defined affinity and specificity. This review describes how rodent, chimeric, and humanized antibodies have each been used, with varying degrees of success to treat cancer, septicemia, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases. We also describe here recent applications of antibody engineering, such as the use of bispecific antibodies and antibody fragments in immunotherapy.",

            "text": "Von Behring and Kitasato discovered in 1890 that the serum of vaccinated persons contained certain substances, which they termed \"antibodies.\" In 1895, they treated diphtheria with an antiserum raised against the toxin. On the basis of research on tetanus toxin and trypanosome parasites, Ehrlich proposed in 1900 the \"side-chain theory\" of antibody formation, which hypothesized that physiologically active substances, including toxins, attach to cell surface receptors that are produced in response to toxin-cell interactions and then ejected from the cells into the bloodstream, leading to circulating antibodies. 1, 2 Not until the 1950s, however, did scientists' understanding of antibodies become sufficient to lay the foundation for the development of MAbs. Jerne 3 postulated in 1955 a theory of natural selection for antibody formation. Animals vaccinated with an antigen were expected to produce several distinct antibodies against several epitopes of the antigen. Frank Macfarlane Burnet subsequently refined and expanded Jerne's theory. 4 Burnet's \"clonal selection theory,\" as it is generally known, postulates that cells specific for synthesizing 1 type of antibody are spontaneously generated due to random somatic mutations during the maturation of the immune system and that these cells proliferate when exposed to an antigen. At about the same time, Porter isolated fragment antigen binding (Fab) and fragment crystalline (Fc) from proteolytically cleaved rabbit \u2425-globulin. 5 Until the 1960s, antibody-producing cells were difficult to maintain in culture, because they died after a few days. In addition, only polyclonal antibodies could be obtained. In 1964, Littlefield 6 developed a way to isolate hybrid cells from 2 parent cell lines using the hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymi-dine (HAT) selection media. In 1975, Khler and Milstein 7 provided the most outstanding proof of the clonal selection theory from results of heterokaryons-cell hybrids formed by the fusion of normal and malignant cells. Twenty-five years after Kohler and Milstein produced the first monoclonal antibodies, dramatic progress has been made in using antibodies for diagnostic purposes, but the uses of MAbs to treat disease have-until recently-remained somewhat limited. 8, 9 However, as this review indicates, the potential of MAbs to aid in the treatment of a wide range of diseases is now beginning to be realized.",

There are 2 kinds of light chains, (k) and (l), which are common to all 5 classes. Four subclasses of IgG (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) and 2 subclasses of IgA (IgA1 and IgA2) exist, each with a distinct function. Secretory IgA exists in dimeric form held together by a J chain and is associated with a secretory component that helps it pass through the cell membrane. 10, 11 Each chain has a constant domain to bind host effector molecule and a variable domain to bind to the target antigen. Light chains have 1 variable (V L ) and 1 constant domain (C L ), whereas heavy chains have 1 variable (V H ) and either 3 (\u2423, \u2426, and \u2425 chains) or 4 constant domains (\u2440 and heavy chains) depending upon the isotype class. Each variable domain contains 3 regions known as \"hypervariable loops,\" also known as complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), that identify the antigen. The other amino acids in the variable (Fv) domain are known as framework residues and act as a scaffold to support the loops. The V L and the V H , the C H 1 and the C L , and the 2 C H 3 domains are paired; the 2 C H 2 domains have carbohydrate side chains attached to them and are not paired. The folded constant domains may be homologous among different species, allowing hybrid domains (eg, mouse-human) to be produced. The variable domain confers specificity and affinity. The CDR amino acid sequences are extremely variable and play a large role in interac-tion with the targeted antigen. The chain type, region, and distance from the amino terminus characterize the domains. Thus, C H 2 domain refers to the second constant domain of the heavy chain.",

            "text": "The conventional method of generating MAbs is the hybridoma technology in which spleen cells from immunized mice are fused with murine myeloma cells. Whereas the myeloma cell imparts immortality to the hybridoma allowing cells to be cultivated indefinitely, the immune spleen B-cell confers antigen specificity. Because each hybridoma is derived from a single cell, the cells within a hybridoma cell line are identical and make the same antibody molecule with same antigen-binding site and isotype, hence it is called a MAb. Among several excellent reviews that detail MAb production with hybridomas is a recent review by Dean and Shepherd. 12 Initial attempts to bypass the mouse to make human MAbs involved fusion of human immune spleen lymphocytes with nonsecreting human myeloma partners to obtain hybrid cells that continually secrete a specific antibody. However, poor fusion of human myelomas, unsatisfactory performance of the hybrid cells, and the difficulty in accessing immune lymphocytes have prevented success. Although heteromyelomas-which are fusions of hu-man and mouse myelomas-work better, these hybrids are usually unstable. Attempts to use mouse myeloma cells to create hybrids and derive human MAbs led to the loss of human chromosomes and the inability to make human Igs. 13 Unfortunately, in vitro immunization is limited by its inability to produce a secondary response and by the absence of the affinity maturation process that occurs in vivo. 13 Affinity maturation process is a complex phenomenon, a consequence of intense Bcell proliferation, somatic hypermutation of Ig variable domain genes, and selection for B cells with high-affinity antigen binding, all occurring in the specialized microenvironment of the germinal center within the lymphoid tissue. Thus, the search for an ideal fusion partner for generating human MAbs has been difficult, which is why the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) technique for immortalization of B lymphocytes is preferred. But immortalized B cells do not always replicate exactly the in vivo antibody response, because the tissues from which these cells were selected and the manipulations to which they are subjected to in the laboratory may alter the antibody specificity. 14, 15 Protocols for the preparation of EBV virus, B cells, and cell fusion have been described elsewhere. 14, 16, 17 Methods used for large-scale production of MAbs may include the generation of ascites tumors in mice or in vitro mammalian cell culture fermentation by using bioreactors and continuous perfusion culture systems. 18, 19 The key issues in scale-up productions are the growth media, fermenter size, fermentation time, and purification procedures. 19 Purification or downstream processing is accomplished by chromatography, fragmentation, conjugation with chelating agents, ultrafiltration, and controlled precipitation. 18",

            "text": "A more recent technique for producing antibodylike molecules uses what is known as the Phage Display Library. It involves the construction of V H and V L gene libraries and their expression on the surface of a filamentous bacteriophage. Developed in the 1990s, the phage display method requires repeated \"panning\" or screening of different antibodies based on their affinity for a specific antigen. Antibody genes are linked to bacteriophage coat protein genes and the bacteriophages with the fusion genes are used to infect bacteria to create the phage display library. The resulting bacteriophages express the fusion proteins and display them on their surface, and the phage display library comprises recombinant phages, each displaying a different antigenbinding site on its surface. The phage expressing an antigen-binding domain specific for a particular antigen can be detected and isolated by binding to the surface coated with that antigen. Libraries of V H and V L genes may be generated from nonimmunized donors, immunized donors who have an immune response against a particular antigen or from a synthetic library consisting of antibody fragments. 20, 21 One promising way to increase antibody yield or develop new antibodies may be by using genetically altered animals and plants. Abgenix, a company in Fremont, CA, has developed the transgenic \"Xeno-Mouse,\" in which the mouse antibody-producing genes have been inactivated and functionally replaced by approximately 90% of the human Ig gene loci in germline configuration, coding for the heavy and light chains. 22, 23 Upon immunization with any specific human or nonhuman antigens, the \"Xeno-Mouse\" generates MAbs, which are fully human Igs, with high affinities and antigen-binding specificities. \"XenoMouse\" strains producing specifically IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4 isotypes have also been created to generate panels of diverse and highly specific MAbs.",

[43] [44] [45] Humanizing Monoclonal Antibodies Rodent MAbs with excellent affinities and specificities have been generated using conventional hybridoma technology, but their use in clinical medicine is limited due to the immune responses they elicit in humans. For instance, the human antimouse antibody (HAMA) response can compromise the clinical effectiveness of murine MAbs. Although HAMA responses are directed against the murine constant regions, which represent the major antigenic features of the mouse Ig, significant responses are also directed toward the murine variable regions. As a result, patients may mount an immune response against the injected murine antibodies, leading to allergic or immune complex hypersensitivities, rapid clearance of the antibody, and reduced clinical efficacy. 13,46 -51 Initially, Morrison and colleagues 48,52 introduced chimeric MAbs in 1984, which showed several advantages over unmodified rodent antibodies. Generally, chimeras combine the human constant regions with the intact rodent variable regions, replicating the rodent antibody variable regions by PCR and then cloning them into eukaryotic expression vectors containing human constant regions. 49 Ideally, this allows better interaction with human effector cells and the complement system. Because the Fc region has little influence on the structure of the Fv region, the chimeric constructs' affinity and specificity are virtually unchanged, and both rodent and chimeric antibodies cause apoptosis at a similar rate and intensity against target cells in vitro. 50, 51, 55 Although chimeric antibodies have helped solve some of the problems associated with the use of rodent MAbs, they still show significant immunogenicity in humans; because of their approximately 30% mouse sequence, they cause an human-antichimeric antibody response.",

Numerous humanized antibodies have now been designed and constructed, and many are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. 13, 14, 39, 47, 54 Efficient procedures for constructing humanized antibodies have been developed. 13, 14, 47, 55 The first step is to clone and sequence the complementary DNAs (cDNAs), coding for the variable domains of the mouse antibody to be humanized. The mouse hybridoma cell line is grown in an appropriate culture medium, and cells are harvested for RNA isolation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers that hybridize to the 5' ends of the mouse leader sequences and to the 5' ends of the mouse constant regions are designed for cloning light chain variable regions and heavy chain variable regions. cDNA is synthesized from total RNA, followed by PCR amplification with light and heavy chain specific primers. Positive bacterial colonies containing mouse variable regions are then screened.",

The antibody may itself act as an effector-as in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-dependent complement-mediated cascade-or it may involve effector elements such as cytotoxins, enzymes, radioactive isotopes, signals for other parts of the immune system, and/or cytotoxic drugs. 49,50,60 -62 ADCC occurs if Fc regions on the antibodies are recognized by receptors present on cytotoxic cells, such as natural killer cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and monocytes. Complement-mediated cytotoxicity ensues if the antibody binding prompts a complement cascade to occur. Active immunotherapy can be accomplished if the antigen can provoke a long-lasting T-cell response, which may be achieved by administering whole cancer cell extracts or by using small antigenic peptides isolated from tumors in experimental patients or animals. 58 For instance, MAbs mimicking breast cancer-specific antigens elicit anti-idiotype antibodies; this is another way of creating active immunity, which can lead to a humoral auto antibody-like immune response. 58 The use of bispecific molecules that recognize antigens on both the target cell and effector cell can increase ADCC. The most effective mechanisms are blockade of a crucial ligand or growth factor or ADCC in which tumor cells are killed by Fc receptorbearing cytotoxic effectors. Cell killing by ADCC is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to a cell, whereas the blockade of an essential growth factor may not show effects until most of its receptor is saturated. A higher antigen expression by the target cell will increase antibody binding and subsequent ADCC. But high receptor expression will also make it difficult to prevent the binding of a cytokine or ligand at minimum threshold. 53, 59, 63 With a bispecific antibody, the specificity of MAb is combined with the cytotoxicity of immune effector cells, for instance, to neutralize a tumor. 9, 45, 63, 64 Bispecific antibodies link the tumor cell directly to the killer cell via cytotoxic trigger molecules, such as T-cell receptors or Fc receptors, leading to lysis and/or phagocytosis by the effector cells. Although bispecific antibodies can enrich effectors at the tumor site and activate tumor bound effector cells by enabling cross-linking between effector and target cells, they can cause system-wide immune activation because of T-cell receptor cross-linking. Bispecific antibodies can also mediate cellular cytotoxicity via various effector cells, including phagocytes, natural killer cells, and T-lymphocytes.",

            "text": "Another therapeutic technique relies on using antibody fragments, which may be produced by the traditional method (proteolytic digestion with papain) or with newer methods that may reduce damage to the binding sites. 66, 71 Some newer methods attempt to construct mimetics that combine multiple CDRs from several antibodies into single molecules with molecular weights substantially lower than single chain fragments. Because of their smaller size, antibody fragments may be able to penetrate tissues and tumors more readily and be less immunogenic than whole MAbs. However, although antibody fragments may have better penetration than whole antibodies, their shorter half-lives may compromise clinical usefulness. 68 Heteropolymerized antibodies have recently been developed by chemically linking a mouse IgG MAb, specific to a complement receptor site (CR1) on the human or nonhuman primate erythrocyte, to a second mouse IgG MAb that is specific to the targeted antigen. 72 The heteropolymer technique is based on immune adherence, in which antibody-antigen immune complexes bind to a complement receptor on the red blood cell, facilitating the phagocytosis of these complexes. 72 Once introduced into the patient, the heteropolymers will bind to both the red blood cells and the targeted antigen. The antigen-antibody heteropolymer complexes are then transported to the liver and spleen, where the complexes are destroyed by macrophages, whereas the red blood cells return to the circulation unharmed. [72] [73] [74] [75] A wide variety of conditions, of both autoimmune and foreign origin, may potentially be treated with this method, including HIV infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, Marburg virus infection, and myasthenia gravis. 76 -78 Although mouse antibodies are currently being used with this technique, chimeric mousehuman antibodies could also be constructed. 72 It may also be possible to use the heteropolymers as \"sentinels\" by injecting them before antigen exposure. In 1 recent study, multiple infusions of heteropolymers provided nonimmunized monkeys with protection against an antigen (\u233d174) for as long as 2 weeks. 79",

            "text": "When Milstein and Kohler announced their isolation of a MAb in 1975, many thought MAbs would provide an effective cancer treatment. However, early clinical trials were disappointing. 80 -81 Producing MAbs to tumor antigens is a complex process. First, proteins peculiar to human cancer cells are identified; then, mice are injected with human tumor cells (antigen) to stimulate an immune response. After about 30 days, the mouse lymphocytes are removed and fused with myeloma cells to isolate and reproduce hybrid cells specific to a predetermined antigen. Rodent antibodies alone have been used in several trials, but the clinical effects are often minimal because of poor activation of human effector or complement cells by the Fc region of the murine antibody and the accompanying HAMA responses. 55, 57 Substituting the rodent Fc region with a human Fc fragment may help overcome these effects. 81 With the discovery of proto-oncogenes, secondgeneration trials in the 1990s turned to more specific tumor antigens that could be potential targets. 58 In 1994, MAb 17-1A, an antibody to epithelial cell surface antigen expressed on human colorectal carcinomas, was approved for the identification of adenocarcinomas; MAb17-1A may reduce the mortality and occurrence rate of colorectal cancer. 82, 83 In 1997, rituximab, a mouse-human chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, was approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma. 53, 83 Rituximab binds to CD20 antigen on B cells and B cell tumors and then elicits a natural immune response that can kill malignant cells. Recent animal trials have shown the potential of MAb therapy in cancer. 52 Increases in epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression have been found on many human cancers, and a fully human anti-EGF receptor IgG2 MAb has been shown to inhibit human cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. 22 Other efforts are focusing on antibody to HER2 antigen in breast cancer. Patients with cancer often mount an immunologic response to tumor-associated antigens with increases in cytotoxic lymphocytes and antibodies. 14 Several tumor-reactive antibodies have been cloned against melanomas, colon carcinomas, ovarian, breast, and lung tumors. Often, these antibodies cross-react with other malignant tissues or cell lines. 14 Recently, trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized MAb that binds directly to the C-erB2 protein (HER2), has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer. 52,84 -89 Herceptin can be used to treat metastatic breast cancer in patients whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein (about 30% of breast cancer patients) and may be used in conjunction with other therapies such as paclitaxel (Taxol). 89 Antibody was developed by humanizing murine MAb 4d5 by inserting antigen-binding regions of MAb 4d5 into the framework of a consensus human IgG1, resulting in rhuMab-Her2 or trastuzumab. 85 Cancer cells have antigens that are specific to the tumor (tumor-specific antigens) or are present in greater concentration than normal (tumor-associated antigens). Antibodies may eliminate target cells by complement action or through ADCC. The variable region of the antibody recognizes and attaches to a specific antigen and the constant region, then joins with an effector cell capable of killing the targeted cancer cell. When the antigen and antibody bind, precipitation and agglutination may isolate the complex. Anti-idiotype MAbs that mimic-tumor associated antigens also may be used in cancer therapy. 82 The idiotype network hypothesis, formulated by Lindemann and Jerne, suggests that because each mature B cell secretes an antibody with unique antigenbinding specificity in the variable domain (referred to as the idiotype), anti-idiotype MAbs can be generated and used as surrogate antigens or vaccines for immunization against the tumor. 82, 90 A murine anti-idiotype MAb, ACA125, which mimics the tumor-associated antigen CA125, was recently found to induce a specific anti-anti-idiotypic immune response in 28 of 42 patients with platinum-pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer enrolled in a phase I/II clinical trial. 90,91 A positive immune response was associated with statistically significant (P \u03fd 0.0001) prolonged survival times (19.9 \u03ee 3.1 months in patients shown to have an anti-antiidiotypic response compared with 5.3 \u03ee 4.3 months in patients who were anti-anti-idiotypic negative). 90, 91 In addition, peripheral blood lymphocyte mediated lysis of CA-125 expressing tumor cells increased in 9 of 18 patients after vaccination with the MAb. 91 Despite the use of a murine antibody, both this study and a previous phase I study involving patients with ovarian cancer found minimal side effects. 90, 91 Promising early results have also been demonstrated in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma who received a murine anti-idiotype MAb that mimics an epitope of carcinoembryonic antigen (CeaVac) 82, 90 and in patients with malignant melanoma who received an anti-idiotype MAb (TriGem) that mimics disialoganglioside GD2 92 Despite promising developments, however, there are still several obstacles to effective cancer therapy with MAbs. Problems with the tumor, the MAb, or conjugate characteristics all continue to challenge researchers. 52, 63, 84 Thus far, chemotherapeutic MAb therapies have faced obstacles due to the poor ability of agents to affect tumor cells preferentially over healthy cells, the intrinsic insensitivity of many tumors to these drugs, and the rapid development of resistance in tumor cells. 65, 66, 93, 94 MAbs often decrease the size of tumors, but rarely lead to complete remission of solid tumors. 59 At the cellular level, MAbs at low doses ideally should bind with excellent affinities. Because no antigens have been identified that are expressed exclusively on tumor cells, cross-reactivity of MAbs must be examined with histochemical tests on tissue sections or in animal models. Careful testing must also be done to ensure that the effector molecules such as drugs, toxins, or isotopes in the conjugates do not inadvertently target healthy cells. Although humanized antibodies have greater affinity than murine antibodies, this potential has yet to be translated into improved clinical outcomes against cancer. 52 However, recent success using the XenoMouse technology to develop a fully human IgG2 MAb specific to epidermal growth factor receptor indicates the potential for future advances in this area. 22",

Disulfide-stabilized fragments may be more stable or have higher affinity for the antigen than scFV, in which the linker may interfere with binding or fail to stabilize the fragment. 66 Recombinant immunotoxins derived from Pseudomonas enterotoxin have been shown to be active against lymphomas, solid tumors, and leukemias. 66 Because binding specificity and affinity are the key elements, it is not known which form of the immunoconjugate is usually more effective in treating human tumors; some animal tests suggest that the whole antibody, with its longer half-life and bivalent binding, is more effective than the antibody fragments with decreased binding affinity.",

Using antibody fragments or constructs may modify this nonspecific uptake. 63, 68, 82, 93 Radiotherapy exerts most of its effect by emitting a low dose, which exponentially decreases continuous radiation, but the antibody per se may have a cytotoxic effect. The duration of radiotherapy is determined by the half-lives of the antibody and the isotope used. The success of radioimmunotherapy is affected by the specificity, affinity, dose, and immunoreactivity of the antibody, heterogeneity of antigen expression, diffusion rate, tumor volume, blood supply and tumor location, dose rate effects, and variability in dose deposition. The choice of radionuclide, selection of the chelate used to link the MAb to the radionuclide, and the MAb selected are critical in development of radiolabeled MAbs. 80 Suitable radio nuclides include yttrium-90, iodine-131, and copper-67. Iodine-131 was the first radioisotope to be used in treatment of Hodgkin disease and other lymphomas. 68 Yttrium-90 is potentially useful for lymphoma therapy because it decays with \u2424, but not \u2425, emissions that may kill other tumor cells in a cross-fire effect. 68 The energy released by yttrium is 5 times higher than that of iodine-131, which degrades rapidly after uptake into a tumor cell, causing toxicity. 80 In addition to their uses in radiotherapy, radiolabeled MAbs can also be used to diagnose cancer. 18, 56, 57, 82, 94 Radioactive isotopes linked with MAbs may help localize tumors in a form of diagnostic imaging called immunoscintigraphy. For instance, OncoScint, a MAb coupled to indium-111, may be used to detect an antigen (TAG-72) found on colorectal adenocarcinomas. 56",

The development of HAMA response in patients and the decreased effectiveness of murine MAb relative to human MAb have thus far compromised the effectiveness of this approach. However, humanized anti-Tac MAbs, with better human effector functions, may survive longer in vivo and may prove less immunogenic than its murine counterpart. Short-term CD4 antibody therapy may also contribute to long-term acceptance of skin and islet allografts, even after gaining immunocompetence. 102 More generally, the ability of MAbs to induce tolerance to transplanted tissues and self-antigens may hold great therapeutic potential. 97, 102 MAbs to CD4 and CD8 have been studied, although thus far these have not resulted in clinical success. 97 Depletion or blockade of T cells by antibodies may facilitate tolerance by preventing T cells from attacking the graft, and recent T cell depletion studies in primates have proven promising. 97 MAb treatments for other complications after transplants are also under study, including potential treatment of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder with the anti-CD20 MAb rituximab and the use of anti-LFA-1 MAb (odulimomab) to protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury after kidney transplants. [103] [104] [105] Daclizumab, a humanized antibody that targets the anti IL-2 receptor, may reduce the risk of acute rejection of a renal transplant and also lower cytomegalovirus infection rates among transplant recipients. 106 The inflammatory bowel disorder known as Crohn disease has also been treated with MAb therapy. 107 A chimeric IgG1k antibody, infliximab (Remicade), acts by binding to soluble and transmembrane tumor necrosis factor \u2423 (TNF\u2423), preventing it from binding to its receptors on activated macrophages. The anti-TNF\u2423 antibody may provide relief to patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. In addition, the FDA recently approved infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate. 108 -111 ",

Unfortunately, this may inhibit many cytokines, which can impair the patients' ability to fight infection and increase the risk of secondary sepsis; also inhibiting a few cytokines may not be sufficient. Although MAbs targeted toward components of the host immune system, such as individual receptors or mediator cells, help in the treatment of septic shock, targeting the bacterial endotoxin or lipid A of gram-negative bacteria with MAbs may be more efficacious. Lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, a component of the outer cell membrane of Gramnegative bacteria, consisting of a highly variable O-linked polysaccharide chain, an R core region, and lipid A, which in turn is composed of a glucosamine disaccharide backbone substituted with amide-and ester-linked long-chain fatty acids, is believed to be important in many cases of septic shock and septicemia, and can trigger an inflammatory cascade that can cause serious injury and even death. 119, 120 Lipid A is linked by the core region to the O-linked side chain, and variations in the O-linked side chains result in an enormous diversity among Gram-negative bacteria, making adoptive immunotherapy against the O-linked antigenic determinants difficult. 114 Directing antibodies to the core region or lipid A, which tend to be more conserved, would allow for therapy against a diverse array of Gram-negative bacteria. Favorable results with polyclonal J5 antibody have spurred attempts to develop a MAb. 116, 117 A murine IgM MAb, E5 (XOMA, Berkeley, CA) binds to an epitope on lipid A of E coli J5. A human IgM, HA-1A (Centoxin) is derived from a heterohybridoma fused from spleen cells of a patient vaccinated with E coli J5 before splenectomy. 116, 117, 119, 121 Both the antibodies have thus far shown mixed success in patients with sepsis and neither is currently cleared by the FDA for therapeutic use. Because patients with bacteremia often have endotoxemia, HA-1A, an IgM antibody to endotoxin may be effective against endotoxin in the bloodstream as well. Unfortunately, the high cost of antibody ($3500/dose in Europe) combined with the uncertainty that the sepsis is caused by Gram-negative bacteria has hindered the widespread use of HA-1A. 112, 115, 117 Although it is less efficacious, the only other option may be to target TNF\u2423, but 1 recent study reported a high (54.1%) rate of adverse reactions in patients receiving an anti-TNF\u2423 antibody. 118 The antibody was no more effective than the placebo given to control subjects.

            "text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes serious illness affecting the immunocompromised, such as patients with AIDS and those undergoing organ transplants. Infection rates may be up to 75% in those negative for CMV who receive kidneys from seropositive patients. 122 CMV infection can result in retinitis and gastroenteritis in HIV-infected patients and may also cause chronic intrauterine infection. 122, 123 Up to 40,000 cases of congenital CMV infection are reported each year; mental retardation and hearing loss may occur in about 25% of these cases. 122 Currently, there is no vaccine against CMV. Ganciclovir, foscarnet, and (S)-1-[3-hydroxy-(2 phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]cytosine are some of the potential treatments for CMV infection. 122 Another mode of treatment is via administration of anti-CMV hyperimmunoglobulin, derived from pooled sera of CMVseropositive persons. Passive immunization has been shown to reduce the severity of CMV and prevent mother-to-infant transmissions. 122 Moreover, antibodies may be able to clear the virus from infected tissues, a function previously thought to be exclusive to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Many physicians use a combination of antiviral agents and immunoglobulins in patients at risk for CMV infection. MAbs may also decrease the amount of antiviral agents required for treatment. MAbs against murine CMV polypeptides have been shown to be protective in animal models. 124 Although MAbs may act synergistically with foscarnet or ganciclovir in vitro, it is unclear whether this advantage could be extrapolated to in vivo conditions. Experiments in which murine CMV is used as a model system suggest that high concentrations of antibody, along with ganciclovir or (S)-1-[3-hydroxy-(2 phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]cytosine, synergistically inhibit the growth of murine CMV in cell culture, whereas lower antibody concentrations produce only an additive effect. However, antibody ad-ministered along with ganciclovir in severe combined immunodeficient mice also produced only an additive effect. 123 The extent to which a MAb can protect the host from CMV infection cannot reliably be predicted from its immunoreactivity, neutralizing titers in vitro, or from its antigen-binding data, because the mechanism of action of a MAb in vitro and in vivo may be entirely different. 124 If an antibody is used along with drugs, not only is the treatment efficacy improved but also the side effects of a high drug concentration may be avoided. For instance, 25 mg of ganciclovir/kg of body weight, along with an antibody, was almost as effective as 50 mg/kg ganciclovir administered alone in CMV-infected severe combined immunodeficient mice. 124 The MSL109 antibody, a human IgG1 directed against human CMV glycoprotein, is marginally synergistic in inhibiting CMV in vitro when conjugated to ganciclovir or foscarnet. In a recent trial involving 209 AIDS patients with active CMV retinitis, the rate of retinitis progression was similar in the group receiving the antibody (60 mg, intravenous) for 2 weeks and the placebo control group. 125 Surprisingly, mortality increased in the MSL-109 group, and the poor performance of MSL-109 in this trial may have been due to the inability of the antibody to neutralize the established CMV infection in AIDS patients or its failure to cross the blood-ocular barrier in sufficient quantities.",

            "text": "Liver transplant patients are also at risk of CMV infection and may require treatment with the murine MAb OKT3, an anti-T cell antibody that is directed to CD3 antigen, along with ganciclovir to mitigate transplant rejection. 126 Human MAbs neutralizing CMV were tested for their safety and pharmacokinetics over a period of 3 to 73 days in bone marrow transplant recipients and were found to be safe and efficacious, as evidenced by a steady increase in the neutralizing activity. 127 Also, a human anti-CMV MAb designated C23 that was purified from hybridomas generated by the fusion of human lymphocytes with mouse myeloma cells has virus neutralization titers about 1000-fold higher than those produced after conventional human \u2425 globulin used in humans. 128 A humanized MAb has been developed that binds to the 86-kd glycoprotein, gpUL75 (gH), of CMV, recognizes a variety of virus strains, and neutralizes clinical isolates of CMV; it could be used as a potential agent for the prevention or treatment of CMV infections in humans. 129 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring considerable supportive care, administration of humidified oxygen, and respiratory assistance. The FDA approved the use of a humanized MAb against RSV, which afflicts mostly infants and children younger than 24 months of age. 130, 131 Known as palivizumab, the antibody (produced by Synagis and MedImmune, Inc.) treatment showed a 55% reduction in RSV infection in hospitalized patients. 130, 131 The American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases has published recommendations on the use of this antibody in children at risk for RSV infection. 130, 131 MAbs have also been used in the therapy of HSV infections. The incidence of neonatal herpes is 30 to 50% in babies born vaginally to mothers with primary infection but only 1 to 3% in babies born to mothers with recurrent infections. 132 This difference is attributed to the passive transfer of protective antibodies to the fetus. Antibodies to HSV-1 may also confer partial protection against type 2 strains. Based on this observation, the potential of MAb therapy against herpes has been studied for more than a decade. Experiments in mice, for instance, indicate that microgram quantities of antibodies may promote healing of corneal opacity and blepharitis caused by herpes simplex. 133 However, attempts to confer immunity in humans and other higher animals by passive immunization alone have been disappointing, because antibodies to HSV are restricted to only a few specific epitopes. 133 Among the 11 glycoproteins expressed by the herpes virus on its surface, 5 glycoproteins (gB, gD, gH, gK, and gL) are thought to be crucial to infection. The initial step in HSV infection seems to be the binding of gC to heparan sulfate proteoglycans followed by the binding of gB, and the binding of gB and gC is stabilized by gD. gH is involved in initiation of viral fusion and other glycoproteins may help in expanding the fusion process.",

MAbs can target at least 7 different antigenic sites on HSV glycoprotein D in the murine model. 133, 134 Glycoprotein D is necessary for virus replication in tissue culture. Yamamoto et al 135 reported the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity effect of HS1, a neutralizing MAb to glycoprotein B of HSV, in athymic nude mice inoculated with HSV intracutaneously. When HS1 is administered, the skin lesions healed in 50% of the mice given the antibody. Also, latent infection in the ganglia was prevented in mice that survived, as evidenced by the failure to detect HSV upon co-cultivation with Vero cells. Administration of HS1 after development of zosteriform lesions (5 to 9 days after infection) reduced the virus in the ganglia and prolonged survival time; however, the disease was not totally avoided and eventually the mice succumbed to the disease. The antibody therapy could prevent or decrease the severity of herpetic keratitis, iritis, and blepharitis after corneal infection by HSV. 136, 137 Thus, MAbs could potentially be used to prevent congenital herpes and sexual transmission of the herpes virus. 47, 133, 138, 139 ",

Antibodies were first clinically used in the 1970s for protection against the toxin digitalis. 48, 102 Today, antidigitalis immunotoxicotherapy is a standard therapy. Digoxin is produced from sheep immunized with digoxin-serum albumin conjugate. IgG antibody specific for digoxin is purified and cleaved into Fabs, because the smaller molecular mass of the fragments allows faster renal clearance and more rapid action than the whole antibody. The Fab fragments bind to circulating digitalis molecules and generate a complex that is unable to bind to receptors. Adverse effects are rare, and the immunotherapy is generally effective against digoxin and digitoxin within 1 hour. 120, 141 However, because polyclonal antibodies may be difficult to produce and may cause hypersensitive reactions, researchers have attempted to develop humanized MAbs against digoxin and other toxins. 141 For example, 1 group has used a transgenic mouse to produce hybridomasecreted human MAbs against digoxin. 141 More recently, the effect of goat anti-colchicine IgG antibodies has been studied in mice exposed to a lethal intraperitoneal dose of anti-inflammatory colchicines, and preliminary studies in a 25-yearold woman with colchicine poisoning showed promise. 102, 141 Attempts have also been made to use drug-specific goat antibody fragments to treat anti-tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. 120, 141 Antidepressant overdose is the most common cause of intentional drug overdose in the US. However, lethal doses of tricyclics are 10-to 100-fold higher than those of colchicine, digoxin, and snake venom, which require higher antibody doses (up to several g/kg) to reverse the toxicity. 120, 142 High-affinity tricyclic antidepressant-specific MAbs have been shown to reverse the cardiovascular toxicity of antidepressant desipramine in rats and prolong their survival, and tricyclic antidepressant-specific Fab fragments, along with sodium bicarbonate, a standard treatment for tricyclic overdose, also minimizes the required dose of antibody. 142 The use of smaller antibody fragments, such as single chain Fv fragments, half the size of a Fab, may also be a promising approach because the single chain fragment retains affinity and has shorter half-life in the body.",

            "text": "The primary target of many abused drugs is the central nervous system (CNS), and immunotherapy against such chemicals must be able to penetrate the CNS. 149 PCP or phencyclidine (angel dust) is a type of arylcyclohexamine that affects multiple sites in the brain. 150, 151 It is linked to violent psychotic episodes that are similar to schizophrenia. 149 Treatment is difficult because there is no known antagonist identified, PCP has a high volume of distribution, and about 95% of it is cleared after being metabolized. 151 Recently, MAbs have been described that could bind to cocaine or PCP and act like sponges in the bloodstream to prevent them from reaching the brain. 152 It has been shown that a single dose of antibody reduced PCP effects for up to 2 weeks in animals, which might be equivalent to a several months in humans. High-affinity antibody 6b5 fragments against PCP function better in that the fragments with bound PCP are more quickly cleared from the body than the whole antibodybound PCP. 153 The crystal structure of the antibody fragment complexed with PCP has been studied in detail. 154 Antibody fragments are also preferable to whole antibodies in the treatment of PCP addiction because of their lower antigenicity and improved pharmacokinetics. 149, 151 Anti-idiotype antibodies could potentially be produced against the drug-MAb binding site and mimic drug structural features, although these antibodies do not cross the bloodbrain barrier. 151 By increasing protein binding in the vascular compartment and lowering the drug's volume of distribution, the antibody acts like a pharmacokinetic antagonist. 150 Evidence that the antibody can also reverse effects of other potent arylcyclohexylamine drugs suggests that antibody medications can be used to treat different classes of drugs. 150, 151 An anti-PCP IgG has been produced from a hybridoma cell line using both ascites and bioreactor methods, and the pharmacological and immune specificity of the antibody has been confirmed by administering the anti-PCP fragment to rats in three different studies without producing observable effects in behavior. 155 Active immunotherapy against methamphetamine addiction is also being contemplated. 156 Antibody therapy for cocaine addiction is also a possibility, especially with the development of catalytic antibodies having enzyme-like characteristics that can be used to inactivate drugs. 151, [157] [158] [159] Antibodies with esterase activity have been successfully mimicked, and because cocaine is believed to be metabolized by in vivo esterases, such antibodies would be useful in the treatment of cocaine addiction. 151 Catalytic antibodies probably would not be as useful as high-affinity anti-cocaine antibodies, but could be used in medical emergencies or as part of a withdrawal therapy. 151 Potential antibody applications against cocaine addiction have been tested in rats with a vaccine approach by (1) attaching cocaine molecules to a carrier protein for immunizing rats to produce antibodies against cocaine and (2) humanizing anticocaine antibodies derived from rats and producing them in bacteria. 152, 160 A catalytic MAb (15A10) has recently been reported to attenuate cocaine's cardiovascular effects in mice. 155, 159 Conclusion About 200 years have elapsed since Edward Jenner vaccinated a young child against smallpox. Since that time, the field of immunology has evolved at a rapid pace and has yielded many critical developments. Although vaccination has thus far proven to be the most cost-effective method of preventing diseases worldwide, the development of MAbs that use the specificity of immunological responses is one of the most successful applications of immunology to date. Chimeric and humanized antibodies have reduced the risk of allergenicity from exposure to nonself antibodies and heightened the clinical effectiveness of MAb treatments. Developments in radiology and pharmacology have allowed radiolabeled and immunoconjugated antibodies to be produced. Antibody fragments, heteropolymers, and bispecific antibodies are now available in addition to whole MAbs. These promising developments may soon allow MAbs to be used to treat afflictions as varied as substance abuse, cancer, asthma, viral infection, septicemia, and poisoning. As Heddy Zola observed in 1995, \"The therapeutic application of MAbs, whilst still limited in scope, promises to break its substantial shackles and realize the potential forecast by its proponents.\" 46 ",
