In 1929 Little established the Roscoe B. Jackson Laboratory at Bar Harbor, which acted as a major distributor of inbred mice. The work on mouse genetics goes on apace. Examination of enzyme polymorphisms among different inbred strains allowed the exploration of large, previously inaccessible portions of the mouse genome, and an impressive number of loci of a great variety of characters has now been defined and located on individual chromosomes.",

In 1951 Medawar and his colleagues, who had been studying skin graft rejection in rabbits, turned their attention to mice (12) and made their classic discovery that the rejection of homografts could be abrogated by the prior injection of cells from the donor strain into suckling mice of the recipient inbred strain.
