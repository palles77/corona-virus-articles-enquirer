PTSD therapists must avoid stereotypic assumptions in order to ensure that assessment and treatment are genuinely collaborative and sensitive to each client's ethnocultural and other expectations, goals, and preferences. A culturally competent approach to treating PTSD begins with a collaborative discussion in which the therapist adopts the stance of a respectful visitor to the client's outer and inner world-clarifying the client's expectations and preferences, and the meaning of sensitive interpersonal communication modalities (such as spatial proximity, gaze, choice of names, private versus public topics, synchronizing of talk and listening, use of colloquialisms, providing advice or education). 6. A systematic assessment of trauma history and PTSD thus should include not only a listing of events and symptomatic or resilient responses in the aftermath but how the person interpreted these events and reactions based on his or her cultural framework, beliefs, and values. 7. In contrast to the general pattern of stigma-related violence being directed toward girls and women, gay and bisexual boys and men were more likely to report violent victimization or threats than lesbian or bisexual women or girls. The findings from a survey of gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) adolescents suggest that stigma and victimization begin early in life, with physical and sexual attacks occurring as early as ages 8-9 years old. One in 11 GLB adolescents have been found to have PTSD, as much as 20 times more than other children and adolescents. 8. Poverty puts people at risk for traumatic violence, and not having a stable residence (homelessness) compounds this risk and further increases the likelihood of developing PTSD and associated mental health distress and health conditions. 9. Political repression, genocide, and mass armed conflicts involve psychological (and often physical as well) assaults by the people and institutions in power on people, families, communities, and organizations who are deprived of access to political power and socioeconomic resources-and therefore also on their fundamental freedoms and values. Without access to self-determination and the resources necessary to sustain independence, people are vulnerable not just to traumatic exploitation and violence but also to the traumatic loss of their intimate relationships, their families, their way of life, and their values. 10. Refugees and \"internally displaced\" or \"stateless\" persons who have been displaced from or lost their families, homes, and communities due to armed conflicts or mass disasters (such as tsunamis, hurricanes, or earthquakes) are at least 10 times (and as much as 30 times) more likely than other children or adults to develop PTSD, with as many as one in three refugees or disaster survivors developing Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) or PTSD.",

            "text": "In addition, gender-based biases and beliefs, many of which are based on longstanding religious and cultural traditions, have caused women to be systematically discriminated against and subject to routine physical and sexual assault. Genderbased discrimination and violence against females (whether intra-or extrafamilial) have been so widespread as to be implicated in what Kristof and WuDunn (2009) term \"gendercide.\" In their recent book, they cite examples of selective abortions based on a fetus's gender and differential nutrition and care beginning in infancy also based on gender preference. They are then often followed by lifelong major disparities in education and restricted role and career opportunities for females as compared to males. Unfortunately, even today, with all the advances that have occurred predominantly in Western societies, these same issues remain in place around the world. The increased recognition of the underclass status of the majority of women and girls and the discrimination they face, along with the violence perpetrated against them (often seemingly with impunity), in countries around the world (whether industrialized and \"advanced,\" or relatively primitive) has led to the recent development of major initiatives against global violence and discrimination against women. Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban for her espousal of universal education for girls, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the youngest recipient to date. The brutality of the attack against her was shocking, yet it served to highlight the traumatic threat to which many girls and women across the world are exposed when targeted for hateful acts by those who believe this is necessary to maintain the status quo and the subservience of females.",

When socially ascribed gender and culturally promulgated expectations for gender-based activities, such as mating, are a mismatch to an individual's sense of his or her own true sexual preferences and identity, the conflict can be psychologically devastating. Global initiatives therefore are underway to prevent or ameliorate the adverse impact of discrimination, stigma, and violence based on sexual orientation and identity providing an essential foundation for the basic liberties, freedom from assault, and the right to marry to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered (GLBT) individuals.",

Members of ethnoracial minority groups have been found to be more likely in some cases to develop PTSD than other persons, but in other cases they are less likely to develop PTSD (e.g., persons of Asian or African descent). 4. Members of ethnoracial minority groups often encounter disparities in access to social, educational, economic, and health care resources; it is these disparities that are the most likely source of the increased vulnerability of these persons to psychological trauma and PTSD. (Continued ) to psychological trauma in the immediate or most distant past, or both. Psychological trauma and PTSD occur across the full spectrum of gender, racial, ethnic, and cultural groups in the United States (Pole, Gone, & Kulkarni, 2008) . Psychological trauma and PTSD are epidemic internationally as well, particularly for ethnoracial minority groups (which include a much broader range of ethnicities and cultures and manifestations of PTSD than typically recognized in studies of PTSD in the United States; de Jong, Komproe, Spinazzola, van der Kolk, & Van Ommeren, 2005; de Jong, Komproe, & Van Ommeren, 2003) . The scientific and clinical study of PTSD and its treatment among gender and ethnoracial majority and minority groups is of great importance, especially given the disparities, adversities, and traumas to which they have been subjected historically (Miranda, McGuire, Williams, & Wang, 2008 )-and to which they are still exposed in health and health care, education and income, and adult criminal and juvenile justice (Ford, 2008) . Although Latinos (and possibly African Americans) persons are at greater risk than European Americans for PTSD based on available research findings (Pole, Gone, & Kulkarni, 2008) , it is possible that the elevated prevalence may be due to differences in the extent or types of exposure to psychological trauma (including prior traumas that often are not assessed in PTSD clinical or epidemiological studies; Eisenman, Gelberg, Liu, & Shapiro, 2003) or to differences in exposure to other risk or protective factors such as poverty, education, or gender-based violence (Turner & Lloyd, 2003 , 2004 . In addition, there is sufficient diversity (in norms, beliefs, values, roles, practices, language, and history) within categorical ethnocultural groups such as African Americans or Latinos to call into question any sweeping generalizations about their exposure and vulnerability or resilience to psychological trauma (Pole et al., 2008) .",

One partial antidote for this problem is for clinicians and researchers to be curious about these issues and to ask study participants or clinical patients to self-identify their own racial, ethnic, and cultural background and to essentially educate them about their unique characteristics and associated belief systems and traditions (Brown, 2008; Brown, Hitlin, & Elder, 2006) . It also is important to carefully assess factors that are associated with differential exposure to adverse experiences (such as racial-ethnic discrimination) or differential access to protective resources (such as income, health care, education, police protection), rather than assuming that each member of an ethnocultural group is identical on these crucial dimensions. However, when systematic disparities in exposure to stressors or deprivation of resources are identified for specific groups, such as persons from indigenous culturesthe original inhabitants of a geographic area who have been displaced or marginalized by colonizing national/cultural groups-are found to have a generally increased risk of discrimination, poverty, addiction, family violence, and poor health (Harris et al., 2006; Liberato, Pomeroy, & Fennell, 2006) , it is crucial not to mistakenly conclude that those persons are less resilient than others when they are confronted with traumatic stressors. Commonly, the very opposite is true: persons and groups who are subjected to chronic stressors or deprivations tend to be more resilient than others, but they also are more exposed to and less protected from traumatic stressors (Pole et al., 2008) .",

As of yet, few systematic studies have directly examined racism as a risk factor for exposure to psychological trauma, although the connection is increasingly recognized (Carter & Forsyth, 2009; Hunter & Schmidt, 2010; Miller, 2009) . Perhaps, the Holocaust and other forms of genocide have been the most investigated to date. Studies of survivors of the Holocaust and other types of ethnic annihilation provide particularly graphic and tragic evidence of the infliction of psychological trauma en masse in the name of racism (Staub, 2005; Yule, 2000) .

This study more precisely operationalized racism than any prior study, utilizing two psychometrically validated measures of race-related stressors and PTSD. However, as in the Pole et al. (2005) study, the stressors/traumas and PTSD symptoms were assessed by contemporaneous self-report, so the actual extent of racism experienced by the participants cannot be definitely determined. The Loo et al. (2005) study also did not control for traumatic stressor exposure other than that which was related to racism. In order to extend the valuable work these studies have begun, it will be important to utilize measures based on operationally specific criteria for categorizing and quantifying exposure to discrimination (e.g., Wiking, Johansson, & Sundquist, 2004 ) as a distinct class of stressors that can be assessed separately as well as concurrently with exposure to psychological trauma.",

Racism can also indirectly reduce access to protective factors (adequate nutrition and other socioeconomic and community resources) that protect against the adverse effects of stressors (such as poverty, pollution, disaster) and traumatic stressors (such as accidents, crime, or violence). Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath provided just such an example. It is important to determine whether PTSD is the product of either the direct or indirect effects of racism, or both, particularly given its demonstrated association with other psychiatric conditions (such as depression, anxiety, and addiction) and with increased risk of physical illness (such as cancer and cardiovascular disease) in ethnoracial minorities (e.g., among American Indians; Sawchuk et al., 2005) .",

When family and community relationships are severed-as occurs with massive political upheaval, war, genocide, slavery, colonization, or catastrophic disasters-racial and ethnocultural groups may find themselves scattered and subject to further victimization and exploitation. For example, there continue to be massively displaced populations in Central and South America, the Balkans, central Asia, and Africa. When primary social ties are cut or diminished as a result of disaster, violence, or political repression, the challenge expands beyond survival of traumatic life-threatening danger to preserving a viable life, community, and culture in the face of lifealtering losses and suppression of those very factors needed to maintain (Garbarino & Kostelny, 1996; Rabalais, Ruggiero, & Scotti, 2002) . Ethnoracial groups that have been able to preserve or regenerate core elements of their original cultural norms, practices, and relationships within intact or reconstituted families may actually be particularly resilient to traumatic stressors and protected against the development of PTSD. For example, persons of Asian or African descent have been found to be less likely than those of other ethnocultural backgrounds to develop PTSD. Whether this is due to factors other than ethnicity per se, such as having cultural practices and beliefs that sustain family integrity and social ties, is a question that has not been scientifically studied and should be a focus for research (Pole et al., 2008) .",

PTSD therapists thus must avoid stereotypic assumptions and become both a host and guest in the client's psychic world in order to ensure that assessment and treatment are genuinely collaborative and sensitive to each client's ethnocultural traditions, expectations, goals, and preferences (Parson, 1997; Stuart, 2004) . At times, it is helpful to involve other members of the family or culture in assisting with the treatment. Religious beliefs and spirituality are other dimensions of culture that have not yet been given sufficient focus in most psychotherapy but must also be assessed and understood by the therapist (Walker, Courtois, & Aten, 2014) .",

This is likely to be a serious mistake for several reasons. Sharing some general racial, ethnic, cultural, or national features (or an apparently identical language or religion) is not synonymous with shared identity, knowledge, or history. Even persons from as virtually identical backgrounds as monozygotic twins raised in the same family have substantial differences in physical and temperamental characteristics as well as often quite distinct social learning histories, and thus rarely if ever can reliably read one another's minds or exactly know one another's vulnerabilities and strengths.

Evidence-based PTSD treatment models are not necessarily incompatible with culturally specific healing practices and have in common the goal of fostering not just symptom reduction but a bolstering of resilience and mastery (see Chapters 7 and 8). The integration of culturally specific methods and rituals in prevention or treatment interventions for PTSD, however, requires careful ethnographic study (i.e., observing and learning about the values, norms, beliefs, and practices endorsed and enforced by different cultural subgroups and their particular idioms (ways of describing and explaining) traumatic stress and PTSD) so the PTSD clinician and researcher can truly work collaboratively withrather than imposing external assumptions and standards upon-the members of the wide range of ethnic and cultural communities.",

Physical and sexual abuse of girls and women in their families and by intimate partners destroys girls' and women's sense of self and resiliency, making them easy targets for pimps and traffickers who prey on those who have few options left to them.

The finding that girls and women are more often subjected to sexual and intrafamilial traumatic stressors, while boys and men more often experience physical, accidental, combat, and assaultive traumatic stressors is consistent with stereotypic sex roles that are found in many (but not all) cultures that assign females to the role of subservient helper and caregiver, while males are assigned to the role of leader and warrior. There are biological foundations for these differences-such as due to distinct levels of the sex-linked hormones estrogen and testosterone, and brain chemicals that differentially affect females and males (oxytocin and vasopressin; see Chapter 5). However, biology need not dictate a person's or a group's destiny, so it is inaccurate to assume that males or females must always fill these sex role stereotypes, particularly when there are severe adverse consequences, such as the epidemics of abuse of girls and women and of boys and men killed as violent combatants or as the \"spoils of war.\"",

That was a national survey of women with physical disabilities by the Center for Research on Women with Disabilities (Nosek, Howland, & Young, 1997) . On the one hand, the study found that disabled women were no more likely to report exposure to physical or sexual abuse than women without physical disabilities. However, in more detailed interviews with a subsample, more than 80% reported instances of abuse, on average two incidents per woman (each often lasting for a lengthy time period). For example, the report provides verbatim quotations: More than half of all respondents (52% with disabilities, 51% with no disability) reported a history of either physical or sexual abuse, or both, which is a substantially higher prevalence than that reported in epidemiological surveys of nationally representative samples of women. Notably, women with disabilities were more likely than women without disability to report emotional abuse from a caregiver or family member and to have experienced all forms of abuse for a longer time period than women without disability. Although PTSD was not assessed, women younger than 50 years old with spina bifida (39%), amputation, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or multiple sclerosis (>25%) were highly likely to be diagnosed with depression than women with no disability. In light of the extensive histories of potentially traumatic abuse and of depression, it appears that women with physical disabilities-particularly those in early to midlife adulthood with disabilities that involve progressive deterioration or mental or psychological disfiguration-may be at risk for having experienced traumatic interpersonal violence and other forms of abuse and suffering from undetected PTSD.",

TBI ranges from mild (no more than 30 minutes of unconsciousness and 24 hours of amnesia) to severe (coma of at least 6 hours or amnesia for more than 24 hours). Studies with adults and children of both genders who have sustained TBI demonstrate that they are as likely to develop PTSD as persons in equally severe accidents or assaults who have not (McMillan, Williams, & Bryant, 2003) . Fewer studies have been conducted with persons with severe than mild TBI, but they have not been found to be less likely to develop PTSD, as was originally hypothesized-due to not being able to experience or later recall the psychologically traumatic aspects of the injury as vividly as a person who does not lose consciousness or have amnesia. A subsequent study confirmed that adults with TBI were less likely to report acute traumatic stress symptoms immediately after the injury and to recall having felt helpless when interviewed several weeks later but that 3 months after the accident, they were equally likely to report PTSD symptoms as injury survivors with no TBI (Jones, Harvey, & Brewin, 2005) . TBI definitely exacerbates, and indeed may cause, PTSD, as tragically is illustrated by the extremely high estimates of prevalence of PTSD among military veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars with TBI.

Treatment included high doses of antipsychotic, antiseizure, antidepressant, and antianxiety medications and two courses of electroconvulsive therapy, with periods of relative stabilization sufficient for her to live in an assisted living residential home and on two occasions to live in an independent apartment with in-home daily case management and nursing care. Each period of improvement was relatively brief, lasting no longer than 3-6 months, at which time she experienced severe worsening in the apparently psychotic, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, requiring multiple rehospitalizations and progressive loss of social and cognitive abilities. For several years, family therapy was conducted, and the patient's history of traumatic stressors was assessed gradually in order not to lead to further destabilization. In addition to potential episodes of sexual assault as an adolescent and young adult, her mother disclosed that her biological father had been severely domestically violent during the patient's first 2 years of life, until the mother ended that relationship. When PTSD was confirmed and accepted by the treatment team and the patient and her family as the primary diagnosis, the patient felt that she finally understood why she was experiencing the cyclic surges in distress and was able to utilize affect by factors such as their race, socioeconomic class, gender, age, residential status, and legal status.

Associated risk factors include a lack of education, lack of work skill, physical or mental disability, substance abuse problem, minority status, sole support parent status, or the absence of an economically viable support system (Fischer & Breakey, 1991; Morrell-Bellai et al., 2000) .

Extremely poor women, whether homeless or not, have elevated rates of lifetime PTSD or other mental illness, and a history of such disorders is associated with having grown up in family and community environments with violence, threat, and anger (Bassuk, Dawson, Perloff, & Weinrub, 2001; Davies-Netzley, Hurlburt, & Hough, 1996) . However, homelessness per se may confer additional risk: homeless mothers and their children have higher lifetime rates of violent abuse and assault than equally impoverished housed mothers (Bassuk et al., 1998) . Thus, poverty puts people at risk for traumatic violence, but not having a stable residence compounds this risk and the likelihood of developing PTSD.",

Domestic violence (see Box 10.5) is a microcosm that shares much in common with large-scale political repression, because physical, psychological, and economic power is used to entrap, systematically break down, and coercively control the thoughts as well as the actions and relationships of the victim. On a larger scale, political repression involves similar psychological (and often physical as well) assaults by the people and institutions in power on the people, families, communities, and organizations that are deprived of access to political power and socioeconomic resources-and therefore also on their fundamental freedoms and values. Without access to self-determination and the resources necessary to sustain independence, people are vulnerable to not just traumatic exploitation and violence but also to the traumatic loss of their intimate relationships, their families, their way of life, and their values (Box 11.4).",

Valentino graphically describes a relentless series of traumatic experiences that include his village becoming a war zone, the deaths of family and friends, starvation and continual threats of being killed while traveling by foot with thousands of other \"lost\" children to escape Sudan, witnessing brutal acts of violence by children as well as adults (e.g., a boy beating another boy to death in a fight over food rations), and being robbed and beaten unconscious in his own home in Atlanta by a predatory African American couple.",

Preparation-out-group members are physically separated or confined in a \"ghetto.\" 7. Extermination-murder, starvation, infection, or other forms of inflicting pain and death. 8. Denial-refusal to accept responsibility or admit wrongdoing, maintaining the self-righteous position that the victim group deserved annihilation and were subhuman.",

Survivors also are faced with a choice of holding to their allegiance to their family, nation, culture, and racial identity, despite the punishment inflicted by the perpetrators, or abandoning these basic commitments and rejecting themselves and people like them. Faced with this impossible choice (as epitomized in William Styron's classic novel, Sophie's Choice), survivors often believe that they failed utterly and let down not only themselves but their family and culture no matter how resiliently they coped and the integrity of their efforts.

Torture may be euphemistically referred to as \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" and condoned in order to obtain \"intelligence\" from designated enemies of the nation, although this is completely prohibited by the UN resolution (Quiroga & Jaranson, 2008) . Widespread controversy has attended the use of such techniques by the US Central Intelligence Agency in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorism incidents, controversy that peaked in 2014 with the presidential decision to close the Guantanamo Bay military prison, and the release of the US Senate report revealing and questioning the legality and morality of torture tactics used in interrogation and incarceration. Basoglu, Livanou, and Crnobaric (2007) , in a sample from the Balkan War (1991-2001) studied from 2000 to 2002, showed that the torture need not inflict physical pain in order to produce PTSD.",

The psychological problems most often reported by torture survivors are emotional symptoms (anxiety, depression, irritability/aggressiveness, emotional liability, self-isolation, alienation from others, withdrawal); cognitive symptoms (confusion/disorientation, memory and concentration impairments); and neuro-vegetative symptoms (lack of energy and stamina, insomnia, nightmares, sexual dysfunction) (Quiroga & Jaranson, 2008) . The most frequent psychiatric diagnoses are PTSD and major depression, other anxiety disorders such as panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, and substance use disorders. Longer-term effects include changes in personality or worldview, consistent with complex PTSD (Quiroga & Jaranson, 2008) . The greater the degree of distress and loss of sense of control during torture, the greater the likelihood of PTSD and depression. Resilience, through being able maintain a sense of personal control, efficacy, and hope while enduring torture, is associated with less distress during torture and lower risk of PTSD (Quiroga & Jaranson, 2008) .

Several treatment modalities have been developed, but little consensus exists concerning the standard of practice, and treatment effectiveness has not been scientifically validated by treatment outcome studies (Quiroga & Jaranson, 2008) . A key element that is widely agreed upon is to pay careful attention to not inadvertently replicating in benign ways aspects of torture in the treatment (such as by pressing a survivor to recount traumatic memories without the survivor's informed and voluntary consent; by encouraging or discouraging political, family, and social activities except as initiated by the survivor; or by behaving in authoritarian ways rather than seeking to be collaborative with the survivor). It also is best to use medical, psychiatric medication, and psychotherapy modalities to address the PTSD symptoms of impaired sleep, nightmares, hyperarousal, startle reactions, and irritability. Quiroga and Jaranson (2008) also recommend using groups for socializing and supportive activities to reestablish a sense of family and cultural values, and supporting the traditional religious and cultural beliefs of the survivor. Currently, nearly 250 torture survivor treatment centers exist worldwide, 134 of them accredited by the International Rehabilitation Council of Torture Victims (Quiroga & Jaranson, 2008) . Most of these centers also involve the survivors' families and communities in developing shared approaches to recovery and reparation of the harm done to all.",

            "text": "The controversy concerning the use of torture on detainees in the so-called \"war on terror\" has led to deep concern on the part of not only the public at large but specifically by mental health professionals. The issue is that psychiatry and psychology professionals who are in the military or consult to the military have been involved in the detention and interrogation of suspected terrorists at high-security facilities such as the military base at Guantanamo Bay and the military prison in Iraq, Abu Ghraib. As a result, guidelines for mental health professionals working in these or similar facilities in which prolonged detention and interrogation may involve practices that constitute torture have been developed by a special committee of the American Psychological Association's Division (56) on Trauma Psychology (Box 11.5). The APA Council of Representatives \u2026 included in its \"unequivocal condemnation\" all techniques considered torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Geneva Conventions; the Principles of Medical Ethics Relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, particularly physicians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, the McCain Amendment, the United Nations Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment an \"absolute prohibition against mock executions; waterboarding or any other form of simulated drowning or suffocation; sexual humiliation; rape; cultural or religious humiliation; exploitation of fears, phobias, or psychopathology; induced hypothermia; the use of psychotropic drugs or mind-altering substances; hooding; forced nakedness; stress positions; the use of dogs to threaten or intimidate; physical assault, including slapping or shaking; exposure to extreme heat or cold; threats of harm or death; isolation; sensory deprivation and overstimulation; sleep deprivation; or the threat [of these] to an individual or to members of an individual's family.

In other words, these potentials for trauma extend beyond the narrow procedures that meet international definitions of torture. The evidence for risk of psychological trauma to detained enemy combatants is particularly compelling and well grounded in formal research, but there is also suggestive anecdotal and theoretical evidence of trauma induction in interrogators and the broader society. We were particularly struck by the fact that the potentially traumatic elements include not only activities designed to extract information from prisoners but also much of the detention process as it is currently conceived, beyond much oversight, or compliance with international law. Given the pervasiveness of these traumatogenic elements, it is questionable whether psychologists can function in these settings without participating in, or being adversely affected by, heightened risk for trauma. Nonetheless, as a group of psychologists with expertise in preventing traumatic stress and ameliorating debilitating posttraumatic sequelae, we believe that certain steps could \u2026 minimize the risk of psychological trauma.

            "text": "Psychologists should promote situations that maintain the risk of traumatic stress at acceptably low levels and avoid situations that heighten the risk for traumatic stress occurring. Among other things, this means that psychologists should not provide professional services in secret prisons that appear to be beyond the reach of normal standards of international law or in settings in which torture and other human rights abuses have been credibly documented to be permitted on the basis of local laws. It also suggests that psychologists should not support or participate in any detention or interrogation procedure that constitutes cruel or inhumane treatment or that otherwise has been shown to elevate risk of traumatic stress (e.g., prolonged isolation). 3. If psychologists work in settings in which detention and interrogations are conducted, then they should conduct or seek an assessment of the potential traumatic features of the treatment of detainees before, during, and after interrogation. This assessment can be informal or formal, depending on whether other systems of oversight are in place. This assessment should include an examination of the social psychological factors that could elevate risk of trauma. Because not all psychologists have expertise in assessing traumatic stress risk and/or social psychological (Continued ) factors, the assessment should be conducted by psychologists who have this specific expertise. Such assessments could inform decisions not only by psychologists but also by others working in facilities in which detention and interrogation occur. It is recommended therefore that APA advocate for appropriate governmental authorities to appoint an independent oversight committee for each facility of this type and that the oversight committees include psychologists identified by APA as having relevant expertise. 4. If psychologists work in settings in which risk of traumatic stress is found to be elevated then they should (i) formally recommend alterations that could reduce the traumatogenic potential of the detention and interrogation process (n.b. some recommendations may be aimed at policy makers rather than local authorities); (ii) conduct or seek an assessment of posttraumatic stress symptoms and associated features (e.g., depression, dissociation) in detainees, interrogators, and other directly or indirectly involved staff; (iii) recommend appropriate psychological interventions for any detainees or personnel found to be suffering from clinically significant psychological difficulties; and (iv) refuse to participate in any activities that significantly increase risk of traumatic stress. If a psychologist working in such settings does not have specific expertise required to meet some of the above recommendations, then she or he should consult with psychologist(s) who have this expertise to make the appropriate determination. 5. Because some detainee abuses have been credibly linked to an absence of appropriate training and/or expertise, psychologists should advocate for, participate in designing, and/or assist with providing appropriate and comprehensive training to all personnel involved in interacting with detainees. This training should include (i) clear ethical guidelines emphasizing the prohibition of causing harm and the importance of protecting detainee rights, (ii) a research-based overview of the nature and consequences of traumatic stress and posttraumatic impairment as they relate to the interrogation and confinement process and all parties involved in layperson terms with practical implications, and (iii) detailed review of research on false confessions, in layperson terms, with practical implications for enhancing the validity and utility of information gathered in the course of interrogation and detention. Because not all psychologists have expertise in these specific matters, APA should develop standardized training materials that cover the current state of psychological knowledge and practices on these important topics, and ensure that these materials are regularly updated by qualified psychologists in consultation with experts from other fields such as law enforcement, the military, and human rights. 6. Because protecting human rights reduces the risk for traumatic stress and posttraumatic impairment, psychologists should collaborate with legal, military, and other colleagues to advocate for due process for all detainees, including providing clear guidelines about finite lengths of detention prior to formal hearing or trial and enforcing the recent Supreme Court decision to reinstate habeas corpus and other international standards of human rights. Psychologists' support for these actions should not come from a blanket support for adherence to law but rather from an informed judgment that these \u2026 laws reduce the risk for harm. Psychologists should be prepared to disagree with any future international laws or US Supreme Court decisions that heighten risk for traumatic stress.",

Such increased transparency could reduce the likelihood of traumatizing practices, increase the likelihood that traumatizing practices will be identified and stopped as early as possible, and protect ethical psychologists and other workers within the system from being falsely accused of acting unethically. We recognize that this recommendation raises an apparent conflict with the goal of secrecy commonly endorsed by national security organizations. We concur that full transparency is unreasonable and counterproductive. Yet, we do believe that increased transparency is a safeguard against traumatizing practices. Though the details of resolving this conflict are beyond the scope of this task force's expertise, we believe that reasonable, knowledgeable intelligence experts, in consultation with psychologists, can construct a system of oversight that will both retain credible independence from the military chain of command and guard classified information. One suggestion may be to establish a greater presence of psychological expertise within a framework of oversight protection. 8. If psychologists are going to continue to be involved in interrogations, then it will be important to continue to segregate the function of interrogation consultant from that of mental health provider to reduce risk of perceived or actual betrayal by the detainee. It is unknown whether betrayal of trust due to dual roles can constitute a direct form of traumatization under these circumstances, but it is likely that betrayal in this context could exacerbate traumatic stress that occurs of other aspects of detention and interrogation (especially in light of the ways that such detention appears to disrupt attachment as outlined in the body of our report). Maintaining separate roles also may enable the psychologist to more effectively assist detainees with traumatic stress reactions by fostering a trusting therapeutic relationship. 9. Psychologists should advocate for extra protections for detainees who are from vulnerable populations such as minors, ethnic minorities, or other groups that have limited access to socioeconomic or political resources or are potentially subject to societal discrimination or prejudice because such groups may be more likely to receive coercive interrogations and/or excessive force and less likely to be sympathetically viewed by the general public. For this purpose, psychologists may work within sponsor/authorizing organizations to institute developmental, gender, and culture sensitivity trainings for interrogators and should review evidence concerning the impact of different forms of traumatic stressors and differential sensitivity to the interrogation/detention setting/process on different (and particularly vulnerable) ages, genders, and cultural backgrounds. Such psychologists should, to whatever extent possible, guard against such information being used to exploit vulnerable populations and instead emphasize ways to enhance safety and psychological wellbeing in the interrogation process. If psychologists lack relevant expertise to meet the recommendations, \u2026 they should seek or advocate for outside expert consultation. 10. Psychologists should collaborate with colleagues from a variety of professions and organizations, including the military and intelligence organizations, to conduct ethical research on several aspects of the detention and interrogation process, especially its potential for inducing trauma. Recent reviews suggest that most of the interrogation procedures used today have not received recent rigorous study (Intelligence Science Board, 2006) . Furthermore, very little of the recent study has been directed toward understanding the psychological effects of interrogation on not only the detainees but also the people working within and outside the interrogation and detention system.",

Refugees are defined by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as persons who have left their nation of origin to escape violence. Article one of the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees defines a refugee as someone who \"owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it\" (UNHCR, p. 16; http:// www.unhcr.org/home/PUBL/3b5e90ea0.pdf; accessed 19.01.09). Therefore, refugees are distinct from both legal and illegal immigrants, economic migrants, environmental migrants, and labor migrants (Weine, 2008) . Refugees must involuntarily leave home, community, and family and friends, often with limited resources or preparation and usually without knowing whom they can trust and where they can find safe passage and a safe haven. Thus, both prior to and during the displacement, refugees often suffer psychologically traumatic experiences, including having their community or homes attacked or destroyed due to war; racially, genderbased, or ethnically targeted genocide or terrorism; institutionally orchestrated deprivation and violence; along with torture, atrocities, rape, witnessing violence, fear for their lives, hunger, lack of adequate shelter, separation from loved ones, and destruction and loss of property (Weine, 2008) .",

Even though the extent of death and destruction was less in the worst-hit areas of Thailand than in Indonesia, symptoms of PTSD were reported by 12% of displaced and 7% of nondisplaced persons in the most damaged area of Thailand (and by 3% in the less damaged areas). Anxiety or depression symptoms were reported by three times as many persons, with similar proportions depending on displacement and the severity of damage to the community. Thus, this study adds to the findings of the study from Indonesia by demonstrating that displacement from home and community was a factor in PTSD and related symptoms soon after a mass natural disaster.",

Thus, the Thailand study showed that losing not only home or community but also one's ability to generate an independent income through gainful work may contribute to the development and persistence of PTSD and related anxiety and depression symptoms. The defining characteristics of becoming a refugee in the wake of disaster therefore include (i) exposure to life-threatening catastrophe; (ii) loss of or separation from family and friends, (iii) loss of home and community; and (iv) loss of one's personal or family livelihood. Each of these factors may result in acute posttraumatic distress, and the combination of several places people at risk for persistent PTSD.",

The half of all refugees who are resettled in cities experience economic pressures due to poverty and low-wage work and must live in communities that are crowded, segregated economically and culturally, and often adversely affected by crime, gangs, drugs, AIDS, and troubled schools (Weine, 2008) . Another half of all refugees are resettled in suburban and rural areas, which are more isolated (www.unhcr.org). In either case, refugees often face prolonged separations from family, friends, and loved ones, as well as the burden of having to find a way to subsist while saving money to bring others to their new home and to provide support to those back home who have stayed behind.",

Refugee children often display not only the symptoms of PTSD but also behavior problems (such as control, aggression, or defiance of authority), profound bereavement, and developmental, learning, or educational delays or deficits that are understandable in light of their often chronic deprivations before and during displacement.

To deliver culturally appropriate services, many programs involve traditional healers, socialization or mutual support groups, multifamily groups, and culturally based activities (Weine, 2008) . Services also tend to be provided by staff who themselves are members of the refugees' ethnic community, in collaboration with traumatic stress specialists and mental health professionals. The traditional model of Western professional \"expert\" doctor or consultant who unilaterally tells local staff or clients how best to do assessment, diagnosis, or treatment has been justly criticized as culturally insensitive and potentially harmful rather than helpful (Weine, 2008) . Instead, the joint experience and expertise of the refugee client, local professional and paraprofessional alike, traditional healers, and traumatic stress professionals are taken together in a team approach that validates the client's and local helpers' cultures and traditions. This approach enhances the providers' ability to make a true cross-cultural assessment of symptoms and diagnoses, to adapt interventions to reflect different cultural beliefs and practices, and to engage not just individual clients but families and communities in recovery from PTSD. Such an approach is consistent with new theoretical views of refugee traumatic stress, which include \"the concepts of cultural bereavement, cultural trauma, family consequences of refugee trauma, community trauma, and social suffering\" (Weine, 2008) . This more culturally grounded view of refugees' experiences of traumatic stress and recovery from PTSD has led to the development of innovative therapy approaches (such as incorporating personal testimony and reconciliation into treatment) that address refugees' psychological vulnerabilities but strongly acknowledge their (and their families' and communities') hopes and strengths (Weine, 2008) .",

The American Red Cross dispatched DMH providers from local and adjacent communities to provide mental health support and stress reduction assistance. National volunteers recruited from across the country arrived within a few days to augment that mission. Concurrently, ICISF-trained volunteers, some of whom were already part of military mental health systems, also arrived to provide assistance. Other agencies, such as FBOs, also organized support for victims. In Washington, the military was the gatekeeper for volunteers and worked closely with the American Red Cross to coordinate mental health support. In New York, civilian authorities collaborated with the American Red Cross. As family assistance centers were set up to aid grieving families, national DMH volunteers continued providing mental health support. Because the terrorist attacks created a crime scene, access was controlled and NGOs needed official standing to provide assistance. Incorporating lessons learned from 9/11, a similar event today would be different in several ways: all NGOs and government agencies would organize their response under the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the NRF, thus creating a more centralized, coordinated response and reducing overlapping or competing activities on the part of NVOADs. Because of ongoing coordination and outreach efforts since 9/11, a greater array of disciplines and specific types of expertise would be available through NGOs. The benefits of these efforts were seen during the responses to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.",

When traumatic stress occurs in a person's or community's life, its impact is influenced by these identity factors. When identity is used as a basis for stigma, discrimination, or socioeconomic disadvantage, those stressors compound the effect of traumatic stressors and can be traumatic in and of themselves. By addressing the vulnerability that this combination in a scientifically and clinically responsible manner (Alcantara, Casement, & Lewis-Fernandez, 2013; C'De Baca, Castillo, & Qualls, 2012; Ghafoori, Barragan, Tohidian, & Palinkas, 2012) to assist rather than stigmatize persons and communities (Ruglass et al., 2014) , the traumatic stress professional can play a crucial role in our society's quest for social justice.",

South Africa, meanwhile, was the largest recipient of individual asylum applications (107,000), a status it has held for the past 4 years. UNHCR's original mandate was to help refugees, but in the six decades since the agency was established in 1950, its work has grown to include helping many of the world's internally displaced people and those who are stateless (those lacking recognized citizenship and the human rights that accompany this). The Global Trends 2011 report notes that only 64 governments provided data on stateless people, meaning that UNHCR was able to record numbers for only around a quarter of the estimated 12 million stateless people worldwide. Of the 42.5 million people who were in a state of forced displacement as of the end of last year, not all fall under UNHCR's care. Some 4.8 million refugees, for example, are registered with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. Among the 26.4 million internally displaced, 15.5 million receive UNHCR assistance and protection. Overall, UNHCR's refugee and IDP caseload of 25.9 million people grew by 700,000 people in 2011. http://www.unhcr.org/4fd9e6266.htm, accessed 4/14/15 Most reside in neighboring countries, fleeing from conflict-torn places such as Burundi, Congo, Somalia, and Sudan in Africa; Palestine and Iraq in the Middle East; Afghanistan, China, Nepal, Myanmar, and Malaysia in Asia; Colombia in South America; and the Balkans and Russian federation.
