A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10774671, presumably responsible for alternate splicing of this gene, has frequently been associated with a variety of viral diseases, including emerging respiratory infections. We investigated the SNP-dependent expression of OAS1 variants in primary cultured human bronchial epithelial cells. Total RNA was subjected to real-time RT-PCR with specific primer sets designed to amplify each transcript variant. We found that the p46 transcript was mainly expressed in cells with the GG genotype, whereas the p42 transcript was highly expressed, and the p44a (alternate exon in intron 5), p48, and p52 transcripts were expressed to a lesser extent, in cells with the AA genotype. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the p46 isoform and a smaller amount of the p42 isoform were present in cells with the GG genotype, whereas only the p42 isoform was clearly observed in cells with the AA genotype. Cellular DNA fragmentation induced by neutrophil elastase was more preferentially found in cells with the AA genotype. Thus, our findings provide insights into the potential role of OAS1 polymorphisms in respiratory infection. \u00d3",

When viral infection is detected by pattern recognition receptors, infected cells produce type I (a and b) and type III (k) interferons (IFNs) [1] . Binding of IFNs to their specific receptors leads to the induction of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes, including OAS1, which encodes the enzyme 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) [2] . Typically, OAS1 is activated by the binding of double-stranded RNA and catalyzes the oligomerization of ATP into 2 0 ,5 0 -linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) [3, 4] . These 2-5A, in turn, bind to latent ribonuclease L (RNase L), which then dimerizes into an active form. The activated RNase L degrades viral and cellular single-stranded RNA [5] .",

In mice, a single missense mutation of the 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1B (Oas1b) gene, a murine ortholog of OAS1, determines resistance to flaviviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV) [12, 13] . In humans, the A allele of SNP rs10774671 in OAS1 was associated with susceptibility to infection with WNV [14] . An OAS1 SNP (rs2660) in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) 0198 with rs10774671 [10] was also associated with the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [15] . However, the allele associated with susceptibility to infection varied among studies, and the production of different OAS1 isoforms have not yet been fully investigated [16] . Considering that the interactions between virus and host are complex and cell-type-specific, OAS1 expression patterns should be characterized in a particular cell type infected by a virus of interest. In particular, host genetic factors affecting the airway defense mechanism against emerging respiratory viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza, which pose potential global threats, should be studied intensively in preparation for future outbreaks.",

Difference in the expression of OAS1 isoforms among genotypes. Western blotting was performed using antibody against the epitope common to all isoforms of OAS1. HBE cells with AA (n = 8), AG (n = 3), and GG (n = 2) genotypes of rs10774671 were analyzed, and the isoform expression pattern was the same in each genotype. Two representative results in each genotype are shown. As a loading control, the same blot was reprobed with anti-b-tubulin monoclonal antibody (bottom part). minal, HBE cells were pretreated with IFN-b and further incubated with NE, an apoptosis-inducing agent. Although NE itself did not affect OAS1 expression, as assessed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown), treatment with NE and IFN-b caused a larger amount of DNA fragmentation in cells with the AA genotype than in those with the GG genotype (p = 0.021). The genotype-dependent difference caused by NE in the absence of IFN-b did not reach significant levels (p = 0.068, Fig. 4 ).",

Laronde et al. reported that the p42 transcript accounted for 5% of the total OAS1 transcripts in a lymphoblast cell line with a GG genotype, as determined by RNA sequencing [19] ; this was in accord with the results obtained from our absolute quantification method. The translational efficiency may differ between p42 and p46 transcripts because they have distinct 3 0 -UTR sequences that may differentially bind to RNA-binding proteins [29] or to micro RNAs [30] . In Daudi lymphoid cells with a GG genotype [10] , only the p46 isoform was detected [26] .

They raised the possibility that the p46 isoform, arising from the G allele, has higher enzymatic activity than the p48 and p52 isoforms arising from the A allele. This suggests that individuals carrying the A allele are more susceptible to some viruses; consequently, Lim et al. demonstrated that the A allele was associated with susceptibility to WNV infection and that WNV replicated to higher levels in lymphoid tissues from donors carrying the A allele [14] . Lin et al. reported that p42 and p46, but not the other OAS1 isoforms (p44b, p48, and p52), blocked dengue viral replication via an RNase L-dependent mechanism [16] .

NE is a major apoptotic inducer in inflamed airway epithelium, and Suzuki et al. showed molecular mechanisms of leukocyte elastase-induced apoptosis in HBE cells [32] . We also found that NE increased the level of annexin-V staining in an immortalized HBE cell line, BEAS-2B (unpublished observation). However, we could not further investigate other key features of apoptosis than DNA fragmentation in the present study, because the number of experiments using primary cultured cells had limitations. Since the p48 isoform arising from the A allele was previously shown to have proapoptotic activity independent of RNase L activation [7] , it is conceivable that the increased DNA fragmentation in HBE cells with the AA genotype is attributed to this unique activity of the p48 isoform that is presumably absent in the cells with the GG genotype. RNase L activation may not be involved in the difference observed in the present study because OAS enzymatic activity is detectable in the presence of exogenous dsRNA [4] . However, it remains elusive whether genotypic differences in DNA fragmentation was derived from the p48 isoform, because its protein expression was not detected by the sensitivity of Western blotting. Alternatively, the predominant p42 isoform in cells bearing the AA genotype may be related to DNA fragmentation through an unknown mechanism. It is generally known that apoptosis can contribute to protection against viral infection by killing virus-infected cells, but it may also serve as a mechanism for virus-induced tissue injury and progression of disease [33] . We have postulated that HBE cells carrying the A allele are more likely to inhibit spreading of the virus infection through promotion of apoptosis of virus-infected cells; thus, the A allele is associated with resistance to SARS infection [17] . Our findings indicate a requirement for further understanding of allele-specific functions other than classical enzymatic activity of OAS isoforms.",
