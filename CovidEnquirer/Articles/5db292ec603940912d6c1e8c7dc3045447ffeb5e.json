This article considers the potential impact of on-line health information on women's health-care decisions, and the role of physicians relating to their patients' use of the Internet as an information source. In particular, the article examines the effect of on-line health information on the informed consent process. Physicians' disclosure obligations (their legal duty to provide information to patients) and the law of informed consent are briefly described. The article then considers the Internet as a source of health information, and instances and types of misinformation. Finally, the article suggests steps physicians may take to help their patients benefit from Internet health information and to become critical consumers who do not fall victim to inaccurate or misleading information. The article concludes by suggesting that physicians make a practice of asking their patients about alternate sources of information they may have accessed, in order to help ensure that patients' health-care decisions are based on current, accurate, and complete information.",

Physicians' responses to instances of misinformation must be sensitive to the cause of the patient's misunderstanding.

            "text": "Reibl v Hughe? in 1980, it has been clear that physicians are required to disclose material information to patients when seeking their consent to a proposed treatment, diagnostic test, or other medical intervention. This case involved a claim of lack of informed consent by a patient who underwent a carotid endarterectomy and suffered a stroke as a result of the surgery. Mr. Reibl had not been informed prior to the surgery that a stroke was a potential risk of the procedure. In Reibl v Hughes, the court articulated the physician's duty in terms of the information needs of the patient: what would the reasonable person in the position of this patient want to know before making a decision about the proposed procedure?6 The fact that the question is framed from the patient's perspective underlines the importance of patient autonomy as a foundation for the physician's duty of disclosure. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Reibl v Hughes, \"[w]hat is under consideration here is the patient's right to know what risks are involved in undergoing or foregoing (medical treatment].\"5 At the very least, Reibl v Hughes mandates disclosure of the material risks of the proposed treatment; the provision of information regarding alternative treatments, including their material risks; responses to patient questions; and the likely outcome if treatment is declined. In the more than 20 years since the decision in Reibl v Hughes, the courts have continued to add to the physician's duty of disclosure, which now requires a much broader range of information than had been envisioned in that case. As Bernard Dickens has explained, the respect accorded to individual autonomy by \"modern health law makes it likely that courts will continue to broaden the scope of required disclosure. ,,? Given that materiality of information is a matter to be determined in each case, the scope of material information must be capable of continued expansion?",

A recent report indicated that 62% of U.S. Internet users (73 000 000/118 000 000 people) \"relied on the Internet to make critical health decisions.\"!2 The report also indicated that \"health seekers,\" i.e., those who go on-line to access health information, are reassured by statements that are repeated on more than one Web site, and that 72% of these individuals (84 960 000/118 000000) say \"you can believe all or most of the health information online.\"!2 The lure of the Internet as a source of information is not specific to those seeking information on health care, as a recent Australian survey indicated that 53% of those surveyed (531/1001) said that the Internet was where they would most likely seek information about biotechnology. 13 Most of those who seek health information on the Internet find the information they discover to be helpful in health-care decision-making. As reported by Fox et aL,!2 \"Overall, when we asked these health seekers about their most recent search for information, 68% said it had some impact on their decisions related to their own health care or a loved one's care.\" 12 Studies specific to patient usage of on-line health-care resources have also been conducted, and have arrived at similar conclusions: a significant number of individuals turn to the Internet as a source of health information, and most are of the view that information obtained on-line is accurate and reliable. 2 . 3 This perception is particularly interesting in light of a 2001 study of on-line health information, which concluded that \"consumers using the Internet may have a difficult time finding complete and accurate information on a health problem. If people are relying on the Internet to make treatment decisions, including whether to seek care, deficiencies in information could negatively influence consumer decisions.\" 4 Similarly, Taylor et al.,2 in their study ofInternet use to obtain genetics-related information, noted that further consideration must be given to the extent to which \"patients actually do understand the information encountered and [to] whether the information is accurate.\"2 Other concerns include the reading comprehension level of on-line health information,2.4 the unregulated nature of the Internet,3 and the fact that much of the medical information available on-line is provided by entities unrelated to medical professionals. 3 The Internet has the potential to be a valuable resource for patients and physicians alike, in that it may permit patients to become more knowledgeable about health issues. Ifhealth information on the Internet were to become more reliable, physicians would be able to refer their patients to the Internet for information that could be reviewed and discussed at the next patient visit. Patients would have access to more infOrmation than physicians could provide during a visit and additional time to better comprehend what they have read. Currently, however, the quality of on-line health information is variable,2-4 and as the Berland study4 clarifies, there are often significant gaps in the information. The Internet has the capacity to inform patients as never before, but it also has the capacity to misinform.",

MSAFP is a test of the mother's blood ... 14 Much of the information in this statement is accurate (if incomplete), apart from the obviously incorrect statement that amniocentesis is a \"screening test\" and that it is \"routine.\" Amniocentesis is offered only if specific risk factors, the most significant of which is maternal age, are present. While these errors might seem insignificant, in light of the difficulty individuals have in understanding genetic testing 16 and the nature of a screening test as opposed to a diagnostic test (particularly in the context of prenatal testing), the errors have the potential to create misunderstanding. It is easy to see how the decision of a woman who had seen this or similar information prior to, or even in conjunction with, discussing prenatal testing with her physician might be \"negatively influenced.\" She might decide to go ahead with the MSAFP but not amniocentesis, regardless of the results of the MSAFP testing, because of her understanding that both tests provide essentially the same information and that amniocentesis carries more significant risks to her fetus. Furthermore, a woman might misunderstand exactly what the MSAFP test is able to tell her and, therefore, make a decision about testing that she would not have otherwise made.",

Again, it involves screening a blood sample from the mother. It is not wholly reliable, and is usually followed up byamniocentesis.\" 15 The problem is not so much that the information is entirely inaccurate, rather that it is accurate enough to sound close to what a physician may well have said, but is either missing key facts or contains some fundamental misconceptions. Apart from AFP measurement, the MSS also measures levels of other substances, depending on whether the double, triple, or quadruple screening test is used. 17 . 1B A pregnant woman who reads this on-line description of the screening tests might decide to forego both MSAFP and MSS testing because she perceives that she will definitely have an amniocentesis, whatever the results, and is concerned about the risks posed by that test. Likewise, a woman might forego MSS and proceed directly to amniocentesis, thus taking a risk she is not keen on taking, and might not have needed to take, depending on the results ofMSAFP and MSS screening tests. At the very least, a woman reading such information might not understand that the decision to undergo initial or follow-up testing is ultimately hers to make, and that it is therefore not inevitable that MSS testing will be followed by amniocentesis.",

Can anyone please advise me!!\" 19 The woman goes on to explain that her physician had informed her that there is a 1 in 200 chance of miscarriage as a result of amniocentesis, and that amniocentesis is only 62% to 65% accurate. By contrast, the Internet information she found indicates that there is a 1 % to 2% chance of miscarriage with amniocentesis and that amniocentesis is more than 99% accurate in detecting Down syndrome. The most likely explanation for this woman's confusion is not that her physician gave her incorrect information, but that she misunderstood her doctor's advice -the 62% to 65% accuracy referred to is probably in reference to the results of the serum screening. Whatever this might say about the timing and effectiveness of counselling during pregnancy, it does show that women may be willing to trust information found on the Internet, even if that information seems to conflict with advice provided by their physician. 20 ,21 As noted in a report on Internet usage by \"health seekers,\" one woman who participated in an on-line focus group explained that \"[b]ased on what [she] read on-line about the risks and trade-offs of prenatal testing, [she] decided not to go through with amniocentesis to find out if the baby had Down syndrome.\" 12 The potential influence of health information obtained from the Internet on patient decisionmaking should not be underestimated.",

Physicians can begin by educating patients about being critical consumers of on-line health information,23,24 particularly by explaining that the information provided on-line is not regulated,3 and is often not supported by medical organizations. 3 Physicians can inform patients that the health information they find on-line is potentially out of date, due to the rapidly evolving nature of health-care technology, and suggest that patients check the date the site was last updated. 23 Physicians can also provide guidance about sites they feel contain accurate, current, and helpful content, as well as offering literature to supplement the information they provide. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, for example, posts its Clinical Practice Guidelines on-line, including a guideline on prenatal testing,32 and the Alberta Medical Association provides an on-line pamphlet containing information on prenatal ultrasound. 33",

Likewise, it is suggested that physicians give some thought to the fact that large numbers of their patients use the Internet as a source of health information. It is clear from the case law that physicians are required to make efforts to ensure that patients understand the information that is provided to them. 35 ,36 It follows that where patients may have difficulty understanding a proposed treatment or its risks because of information they have obtained on the Internet, physicians would be wise to make efforts to ensure that the information they have provided has been understood. These steps are sound practice, whether or not there is any legal obligation resting on physicians to discuss alternate information sources with their patients.",
