Nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV encapsidates the viral RNA and plays an important role in virus particle assembly and release. In this study, the N protein of SARS-CoV was found to associate with B23, a phosphoprotein in nucleolus, in vitro and in vivo. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acid residues 175-210, which included a serine/arginine (SR)-rich domain. In vitro phosphorylation assay showed that the N protein inhibited the B23 phosphorylation at Thr199.",

The N protein is the major antigen recognized by convalescent antisera and can be used as a diagnostic marker for the detection of SARS [4] .

B23 protein is also identified as one of the substrates of CDK2/cyclin E and plays a critical role in centrosome duplication during cell cycle progression, which is regulated by the phosphorylation of B23 at Thr199 [26, 27] .

Interestingly, the N protein can arrest the cell cycle progression [10, 11] . To study whether the direct binding of B23 by N protein had a functional effect in cell cycle progression, first we examined the effect of the N protein on the phosphorylation of B23. As shown in Fig. 4A , the amount of B23 protein in control cells and N-expressing cells were the same but the amount of phosphorylated B23 was significantly decreased in N-expressing cells compared to that in the control cells. However, there are many factors which can influence the phosphorylation of B23 in vivo. To further test whether the inhibition of the phosphorylation of B23 was caused by the N protein of SARS-CoV, an in vitro phosphorylation assay using immunoprecipitated CDK2 kinase was performed. As shown in Fig. 4B , GST protein did not affect the phosphorylation of B23 at Thr199 but GST-N protein exhibited an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of B23 at Thr199. The above results indicated that the N protein inhibited the phosphorylation of B23 at Thr199.",

            "text": "In our previous research, we found that SARS-CoV N protein contained three NLS motifs and a nuclear export signal, acting as a shuttle protein between nucleus and cytoplasm, and it could arrest the cell cycle progression [10] . B23 protein can bind NLS, facilitate protein nuclear import and play a role in centrosome duplication during cell cycle progression [20, 21, 26] . Therefore, we studied the interaction of these two proteins and the functional effect of this interaction. We discovered that B23 interacted with SARS-CoV N protein in vitro and in vivo. Somewhat surprisingly, we mapped the B23-binding domain within the N protein to a SR-rich domain (aa 175-210) rather than any putative NLS motif. B23 usually plays a role in nuclear import of the viral proteins to which it binds [24, 25] . However, according to our previous study [10] , the deletion mutant N4 (175-422), which could interact with B23 protein, was shown to localize in cytoplasm and the deletion mutant N1 (1-225), which also could interact with B23 protein, localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Moreover, overexpression of B23 protein in HeLa cells did not change the cytoplasmic localization of N protein of SARS-CoV (data not shown). Therefore, we speculated that unlike other B23-binding viral proteins, the binding of N protein with B23 protein might not involve in sub-cellular localization of N protein.",

            "text": "B23 protein is also identified as one of the substrates of CDK2/cyclin E and plays a role in centrosome duplication during cell cycle progression. B23 associates specifically with unduplicated centrosomes and this association is controlled by CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation. B23 loses its affinity to centrosomes in its phosphorylated form. Dissociation of the centrosomal B23 is essential for the centrosome to initiate duplication [26] . The Thr199 amino acid in B23 is the phosphorylation site essential in this regulation of centrosome duplication [27] . In our previous research, we have shown that the N protein of SARS-CoV can arrest cell cycle progression [10] , which is in accordance with the result of Surjit et al. [11] . Here we demonstrated that N protein inhibited the phosphorylation of B23 at Thr199 in HeLa cells and in in vitro phosphorylation assay (Fig. 4) . Therefore, we hypothesize that when N protein interacts with B23, N protein may competitively inhibit the interaction of B23 and CDK2 kinase or the phosphorylation site of B23 may be masked by the bound N protein, resulting in lack of phosphorylation of B23 protein. This can lead to cell cycle arresting since the centrosome can not initiate duplication. In this model, the N protein of SARS-CoV manipulates the host cell cycle machinery by acting as a competitive inhibitor to B23 phosphorylation through its interaction with B23 protein.",
