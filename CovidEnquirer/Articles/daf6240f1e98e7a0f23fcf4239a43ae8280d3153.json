            "text": "The epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), designated SARS-CoV. The RNA genome of SARS-CoV is complexed by the nucleocapsid protein (N) to form a helical nucleocapsid. Besides this primary function, N seems to be involved in apoptotic scenarios. We show that upon infection of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV, which elicits a pronounced cytopathic effect and a high viral titer, N is cleaved by caspases. In contrast, in SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells, which show a moderate cytopathic effect and a low viral titer, this processing of N was not observed. To further verify these observations, we transiently expressed N in different cell lines. Caco-2 and N2a cells served as models for persistent SARS-CoV infection, whereas Vero E6 and A549 cells did as prototype cell lines lytically infected by SARS-CoV. The experiments revealed that N induces the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, resulting in processing of N at residues 400 and 403 by caspase-6 and/or caspase-3. Of note, caspase activation is highly cell type specific in SARS-CoV-infected as well as transiently transfected cells. In Caco-2 and N2a cells, almost no N-processing was detectable. In Vero E6 and A549 cells, a high proportion of N was cleaved by caspases. Moreover, we examined the subcellular localization of SARS-CoV N in these cell lines. In transfected Vero E6 and A549 cells, SARS-CoV N was localized both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas in Caco-2 and N2a cells, nearly no nuclear localization was observed. In addition, our studies indicate that the nuclear localization of N is essential for its caspase-6-mediated cleavage. These data suggest a correlation among the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, subcellular localization of N, induction of apoptosis, and the subsequent activation of caspases leading to cleavage of N.",

            "text": "In 2003, a novel and extremely severe respiratory disease spread worldwide from China and was denoted as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The etiologic agent associated with the clinical disease pattern was quickly identified to be a novel coronavirus (CoV) denominated SARS-CoV. 1, 2 CoVs are enveloped viruses harbouring a positivestrand RNA genome. 3 Like all other CoVs, SARS-CoV encodes four structural proteins-the membrane, envelope, spike, and nucleocapsid protein (N) proteins. In addition, nine predicted unique open reading frames (ORFs) of proteins with primarily mostly unknown function are encoded within the 3\u2032 end of the genome. 4, 5 However, it is already known that ORF7a and ORF3a are involved in the induction of apoptosis. [6] [7] [8] [9] ORF6 and ORF3b, as well as N, inhibit interferon-\u03b2 synthesis. 10 Furthermore, ORF3a forms an ion channel, thereby enhancing virus release. 11 Before the identification of SARS-CoV, CoVs were classified into three groups (I-III). Upon phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV was shown to belong to the novel group IV, 4,5 with a distant relationship to group II CoVs, including members such as the human CoV OC-43 and the murine hepatitis virus (MHV). [12] [13] [14] The RNA genome of CoVs, with about 30 kb in length, the largest known viral RNA genome, is organized by the N protein, which can dimerize via a C-terminal interaction domain. 15, 16 Expression of N is essential for the packaging of viral RNA into viruslike particles, 17 and N interacts with the membrane protein in order to fix the N to the viral envelope. Besides its implication in viral assembly, SARS-CoV N appears to fulfil other important tasks in the viral life cycle and pathogenesis of SARS. In several studies, it has been shown to interfere with cellular signalling pathways. 18, 19 Expression of N induces apoptosis in COS-1 cells 20, 21 and leads to the activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB in a highly cell typedependent manner, 22 up-regulation of COX-2 activity, 23 and activation of interleukin-6 expression. 24 One unique feature of SARS-CoV N is the presence of a lysine-rich stretch near the C-terminus of the protein, which might enable its nuclear localization. 4 Furthermore, two additional putative nuclear localization signals (NLSs) within N have been suggested, with one located at the N-terminal and the other at the middle part of the protein.",

[33] [34] [35] [36] Specifically, the African green monkey cell line Vero E6 undergoes rapid lysis upon infection, but viral persistence can be established. 33, 34 In contrast, colonic cancer cells and neuronal cells are persistently infected by SARS-CoV. 35 , 36 Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV N serves as a substrate for caspase-mediated cleavage upon viral infection or transient transfection into different cell lines, similar to the N protein of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis CoV. 37 Interestingly, for the first time, we found in our analysis that this caspase cleavage is highly cell line dependent. Furthermore, it correlates with nuclear localization of N, shown by biochemical methods and immunocytochemistry. Altogether, our data might indicate an important possible link among nuclear localization, activation of caspases, and mechan-isms for lytic versus persistent infection of cells with SARS-CoV.",

For infection, we chose Caco-2 and Vero E6 cells and verified their susceptibility and the respective propagation of SARS-CoV on the second day post-infection (p.i.). We found that the titer of SARS-CoV propagated on Caco-2 cells was significantly lower (6.5 \u00d7 10 4 pfu/ ml) than the titer of infected Vero E6 cells (1.8 \u00d7 10 6 pfu/ml). Consequently, we used Caco-2 and Vero E6 cells as a model for persistent and that for more lytic SARS-CoV infection, respectively. We inoculated both cell lines with SARS-CoV, lysed them on days 1, 2, and 3 p.i., and subjected the lysates to immunoblot analysis. Interestingly, depending on the cell line, we found only one N-specific band corresponding to the expected full-length size of 46 kDa or, in addition, a slightly faster-migrating band (indicated by an arrow in Fig. 1 ). In SARS-CoVinfected Vero E6 cells, we found full-length N and an additional N-specific signal at each time point of lysis (Fig. 1a) . In SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells, however, at any time point of lysis, only the fulllength signal of N was detectable (Fig. 1b) . were infected with SARS-CoV and lysed 1, 2, or 3 days p.i. The lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal anti-N antiserum. SARS-CoV N was transiently transfected into Vero E6 (c), Caco-2 (d) A549 (e), or N2a (f) cells. Cells were lysed 1, 2, or 3 days after transfection, and lysates were analysed in immunoblot as described above. Identical results were obtained using additional polyclonal antisera (rabbit and human; data not shown).

In order to test whether this form was generated by proteolytical cleavage, we initially used various protease and caspase inhibitors (CIs) to decipher the responsible proteases. SARS-CoV N-transfected Vero E6 cells were mock treated or treated with ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl), lactacystin (LC), or a cell-permeable pan-CI, and lysates were analysed in immunoblot. Whereas treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor NH 4 Cl and the proteasome inhibitor LC showed no effect, full-length N was detectable upon pan-CI treatment (Fig. 2a) , which prevents activation of caspase-1-and caspase-3-related caspases. This indicates that the lower band is the result of caspasemediated cleavage. Inhibition of caspase-3-related caspases prevents the activity of effector caspases-3, -6, and -7, which are the executors of apoptosis at the end of the caspase cascade. To define now which effector caspase caused the N processing, we used similar conditions as described in Fig. 2a , now using cell-permeable caspase-3-and caspase-6-specific inhibitors. As found before, mock-, NH 4 Cl-, or LCtreated cells still revealed cleavage of N. However, cells treated with caspase-3 inhibitor (CI-3, Fig. 2b ) or CI-6 ( Fig. 2c) showed only the full-length signal of N, indicating that N processing is mediated directly by caspase-6 and caspase-3 or indirectly by activation of caspase-6 by caspase-3.",

This mutant protein was found in both the cytosol and nucleus (data not shown), indicating that the deleted element was not the predominant NLS.

Since the analysis of the C-terminal deletion mutant (Fig. 3a) suggested that this region of N contains the caspase cleavage site, we examined this domain for aspartates that could constitute the putative cleavage site. Consequently, two aspartate residues were exchanged by site-directed mutagenesis to glutamates. This substitution mutant, designated D400/ 403E, and full-length N were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Both purified recombinant proteins were incubated in caspase activation buffer with recombinant caspase-6 (or left without caspase-6) for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. Then, the proteins were analysed by immunoblotting. Treatment of wild-type (wt) N with caspase-6 resulted in a signal shift to a lower molecular weight compared with untreated N, indicating that recombinant caspase-6 completely processed wt N. In contrast, the substitution mutant (D400/403E) showed a signal with the same size as that for uncleaved wt N, suggesting that the caspase-6 cleavage site was in fact destroyed by the double mutation (Fig. 3b ).",

            "text": "Mutation of the NLS at residues 257-265 prevents cleavage of N The SARS-CoV N primary sequence reveals three potential NLSs. 25 The N-terminal region of N contains a pat-7 motif (amino acids [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] , the middle harbours pat-4 and pat-7 sequences (amino acids 257-265), and, finally, the C-terminal domain exhibits two bipartite motifs, two pat-7 motifs, and one pat-4 motif (amino acids 369-390) (Fig. 6a) . To determine the main NLS of N, we first deleted the C-terminal NLS (360-422), including the five motifs. This deletion had no effect on the nuclear localization of SARS-CoV N (data not shown), however. Therefore, we investigated the NLS in the middle of N and substituted three lysines at positions 257, 258, and 262 with glycins (NLSII; Fig. 6b ). Lysines mediate the transport into the nucleus by binding to importins. To test whether this NLS is mainly responsible for the nuclear localization of N, we transiently transfected Vero E6 cells with the NLS substitution mutant (NLSII) and with wt N as a control (Fig. 6c) . On days 2 and 3 post-transfection, a nuclear fractionation assay was performed. In contrast to wt N, the substitution mutant (NLSII) did not localize to the nucleus. Moreover, only the uncleaved full-length signal for NLSII was detectable, strongly indicating a correlation between nuclear localization and processing of N. Although it was already demonstrated by immunofluorescence analysis in a previous study that the NLSII sequence of SARS-CoV is a general NLS, 26 we investigated whether we can confirm this by nuclear fractionation assay. Therefore, we fused the NLSII sequence to the N-terminus of the cytosolic protein Grb2 (NLSII-Grb2) and expressed it as well as Grb2 in Vero E6 cells. Two days after transfection, we separated the nuclear and cytosolic fractions and analysed them with anti-Grb2 antibodies in immunoblot. In contrast to the nuclear fraction of Grb2, we detected a signal in the nuclear fraction of NLSII-Grb2 (Fig. 6d) , indicating that NLSII is a functional NLS. To confirm the observation that the activation of apoptotic pathways correlates with nuclear localization of N, we investigated the activation of Bad under the same conditions as previously described (Fig. 3d) . Therefore, we transiently transfected cells with N and NLSII. Three days posttransfection, cells were lysed and analysed with an anti-Bad antibody by immunoblotting (Fig. 6e) . We detected phosphorylated and de-phosphorylated Bad in NLSII-transfected cells, in contrast to N-transfected cells containing only the de-phosphorylated form of Bad. To exclude that this effect is due to different expression levels of N and NLSII, we subjected an aliquot of the lysates to immunoblot analysis using anti-N antisera. This immunoblot analysis revealed that the expression of N and that of NLSII were nearly the same (Fig. 6f) .",

In addition, we demonstrated that the caspase-6 cleavage site is located at residues 400 and 403 of N. The N protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) is also cleaved by caspases during viral infection, pointing to a common feature and an important function of this processing. 37 Caspase-6 is an effector caspase that is, once activated by initiator and effector caspases, mediating the morphological changes characteristic for apoptotic cell death. 40, 41 Its transactivation is regulated by p53, and induction of caspase-6 expression induces apoptotic signals that activate caspase-6. 42 Previous reports already suggested that N is a pro-apoptotic protein. 20, 24, 43 Accordingly, we show that N triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by activation of the initiator caspase-9 as well as de-phosphorylation of proapoptotic Bad.",

N processing is only observed in cells known to be lytically infected by SARS-CoV, such as Vero E6 and A549 cells, but not in Caco-2 and N2a cells, which we used as models for persistently infected cells. 35, 36 Of note, characterization of SARS-CoV pathogenesis by autopsied tissues from SARS patients revealed viral signals in the lung with severe harm, whereas in the intestine and brain, no apparent damage was observed despite detectable amounts of SARS-CoV. [44] [45] [46] First, these give evidence that intestine and neural tissues might be persistently infected by SARS-CoV. Second, these raise the question of whether N is involved in the establishment of lytic or persistent infection. In infected Vero E6 cells, the transcription factor STAT3 is de-phosphorylated and disappears from the nucleus, 47 resulting in decreased cell viability. In N-transfected COS-1 cells, p38 MAPK and JNK as well as caspase-3 and caspase-7 are up-regulated. 20 In contrast, in persistently infected Vero E6 subclones, the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are up-regulated. Here, transient expression of N induced phosphorylation of Akt and JNK, possibly leading to the establishment of persistence. 33 In human intestinal epithelial cells and in neurons, the PI3/ Akt pathway can be involved in cell survival. [48] [49] [50] Therefore, the different regulation of survival pathways in various cell lines could account for the distinctions exhibited by N regarding activation of apoptotic pathways.",

This is also the case in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, 18 raising the common question of whether here induction of apoptosis is host defence or is even favourable for the viral life cycle. In the case of host defence, the infected cell initiates apoptosis to inhibit spread of progeny virus or to eliminate viral proteins at the end of the apoptotic cascade. However, a growing number of viruses were shown to adapt to the host cell death machinery in order to promote spread of progeny or to utilize caspases to cleave their own proteins for benefiting viral replication or persistence. 51 CoV-induced apoptosis occurs upon infection of cells with TGEV, and here the N protein serves as substrate for caspase-6 and caspase-7. 37 In defined SARS-CoV-infected cell lines, N is also cleaved by caspases. Moreover, we show here that upon transient expression, N itself is an inducer and subsequently a substrate of caspase-6 in Vero E6 and A549 cells. This is in contrast to many other viral proteins, which either provoke or are the target of apoptosis, and suggests that caspase-6 activity and subsequent processing of N have roles during viral maturation other than simply the induction of apoptosis to fend the virus. In general, the N protein would be an appropriate target for fending of viral invasion, since this protein is necessary for viral assembly. Moreover, in the case of TGEV, only full-length N is packaged in the virion, 37 indicating that caspase-6 processing might inhibit viral assembly. On the other hand, in Vero E6 cells, high viral titers are achieved despite N cleavage. Furthermore, a caspase cleavage site occurs also in TGEV N and has not been eliminated by mutations more beneficial for the virus, suggesting an important role for the viral life cycle.",

This means that only in cells exhibiting nuclear localization of N was the protein processed by caspase-6. This raises two possibilities: either N is translocated to the nucleus, leading to the induction of caspase-6 activity, or N can only be imported into the nucleus if caspase-6 is active during apoptotic processes. An example for such a mechanism is provided by the NS1 protein of Aleutian mink disease parvovirus. 52 When we analysed a mutant of N containing substitutions within the predicted NLS between residue 257 and residue 265, it was not imported into the nucleus. This demonstrates that this stretch contains a functional NLS, supported by the partial redistribution to the nucleus of transiently expressed cytosolic Grb2 fused to this NLS. Even more interesting are that the mutant was not cleaved in Vero E6 cells and Bad was not de-phosphorylated, indicating that apoptosis and, subsequently, caspase-6 were not activated. Furthermore, treatment of N-transfected Vero E6 cells with CIs did not prevent nuclear localization of N (data not shown), indicating that caspase cleavage is not necessary for nuclear import of N. This leads to the conclusion that nuclear localization of N is a prerequisite for the induction of caspase-6 activity. Of note, we found both processed and full-length N within the nucleus. This is reasonable, as the processed form of N still contains the NLS. Since caspase-6 cleaves lamin A during apoptosis, leading to an increased permeability of the nuclear pores, 51 N might also enter the nuclei of apoptotic cells non-specifically by passive diffusion. This was basically excluded by us because the cytosolic marker protein Grb2 was detectable exclusively within cytoplasmic fractions.",

The C-terminal double-substitution mutant D400/403E and the NLS K257G,K258G,K262G (NLSII) substitution mutant were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The NLSII sequence (amino acids 257-262) of N was engineered N-terminally to Grb2 (NLSII-Grb2) by PCR mutagenesis. Sequence analysis was always carried out to confirm the amino acid substitutions. For expression in eukaryotic cells, the full-length and all mutants were cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo (+) (Invitrogen).",

The eluate was refolded by dialysis against sodium acetate, Fig. 7 . Hypothetical model for correlation of nuclear localization and caspase-mediated cleavage of N in lytic SARS-CoV infection. N translocates into the nucleus (1) and may activate gene expression or interact with nuclear components there (2) , resulting in the de-phosphorylation of Bad (3) . In this form, Bad is enabled to interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (4). This interaction releases Bax and Bak from prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, enabling insertion of Bax and Bak in the mitochondrial membrane. The resulting membrane permeabilization facilitates cytochrome c efflux (5) , which provokes the activation of pro-caspase-9 by formation of apoptosome. Once caspase-9 is activated, the caspase cascade occurs and effector caspases (i.e., caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7) are activated (6) . Finally, N is cleaved by caspase-6 (7), but cleavage of N may additionally be caused by caspase-3 or caspase-7. pH 5.2, and quantified by Bradford assay (Coomassie protein assay reagent, Pierce, Bonn, Germany). The purified proteins were used for immunization of rabbits and for the in vitro caspase-6 cleavage assay.",
