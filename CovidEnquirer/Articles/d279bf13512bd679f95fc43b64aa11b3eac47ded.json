            "text": "Results Fifty-five studies (23 published in English), surveying a total of 8649 migrants, 40 were identified. The most commonly studied migrant nationalities were Brazilian (36%), 41 followed by Chinese (27%) and Filipino (8%). Thematic analysis of barriers to mental well-42 being among migrants chiefly identified \"language difficulties\", \"being female\" and \"lack 43 of social support\", whereas the primary facilitators were \"social networks\" followed by Global migration has increased markedly in recent decades and international migrants now 65 constitute 3.4% of the global population. [1] International migrants are considered to be Article Summary Strengths and limitations of this study \uf0b7 Our study is the first to comprehensively screen and synthesizes available research, published both in Japanese and English, on the mental well-being of international migrants to Japan. \uf0b7 Our study describes contemporary migrant health and social support networks were found to be the key facilitator of mental well-being. \uf0b7 The cross-sectional nature of the included studies limits the value in supporting causal effects and generalizability. \uf0b7 While English and Japanese databases were surveyed, grey literature was not comprehensively searched for relevant titles. institutional health research that includes non-citizens, [11] in Japan, only exploratory 89 research has been conducted on the health of migrants. 90 Facing such a demographic reality, the Japanese government has begun to publicly 91 acknowledge the need for more foreign workers; however, structural issues continue to 92 perturb the humanistic integration of international migrants. For example, a comprehensive 93 2017 survey showed that 30% of foreign residents had experienced discrimination in Japan, 94 with 40% having been rebuffed when seeking housing and 25% had been denied a job due Thematic analysis 235 Many more barriers than facilitators to mental well-being were cited among the included 236 studies and multiple themes were often described in a single study. Among the included studies, the most common barrier was trouble communicating in 240 Japanese as 10 studies described such difficulty as negatively impacting mental health.",

It seems awareness of migration as 355 a social determinant of health could be improved within the Japanese healthcare system and 356 society at large. 357 Robust sampling in migration research is understood to be difficult because migrant 358 populations are inherently mobile and often prefer to remain unidentified; thus, migrant 359 research is chronically underfunded as research agencies are reluctant to award grants 360 where rigorous methodology does not exist.[3] We found most studies on migrant mental 361 well-being in Japan were community-based and used convenience or snowball sampling. 362 Unsurprisingly, study populations were small, as half of studies enrolled less than 119 363 participants and only one publication included explicit sample size calculations.[79] The 364 study with by far the largest sample size, utilized government survey records from 365 Hamamatsu, Ibaraki Prefecture, to study the social connectedness of 1252 Brazilians",

In contrast, in 370 their systematic review of issues for immigrant women in the perinatal period, Kita and 371 colleagues surveyed more than ten studies with large samples sizes that reviewed Japanese 372 medical or governmental records.[61] In order to increase the rigor of migrant health 373 research in general, more analyses of health records and secondary analysis of government 374 administered surveys are needed like the large-scale surveys regularly carried out in the 375 European Union.[26] 376 Next, the representativeness of migrant sampling, in terms of proportionality to the 377 actual foreign national community in Japan, was found to be skewed. According to the 378 Ministry of Justice, the four most populous migrant nationalities as of 2018, in descending 379 order, were Chinese (29%), Korean (18%), Vietnamese (10%) and Filipino (10%).[27] 380 Contrastingly, the most populous migrant populations represented in our study were 381 Brazilian (37%), Chinese (27%), Filipino (8%) and Korean (4%). It seems that Brazilian 382 migrants and students, particularly Chinese students, have received more research attention 383 in Japan. However, the Nepalese and Vietnamese populations in Japan have exploded in 384 recent years but are not well-represented in the literature. Such disparities between the 385 literature and reality were remarkable and may carry across migrant studies in Japan and 386 should be addressed for accurate scoping of migrant health.Japan are relatively understudied compared to migrant groups in other 388 developed countries, especially in terms of mental health status. Japanese society, led by 389 government, is at a critical juncture with new visa categories launched in April 2019 390 increasing the number of foreign workers dramatically.[29] Key health policy documents, 391 such as the WHO Japan Health System Review, discuss health equity in depth but only 392 mention migrant health in passing.[30] As it becomes clear that Japan perhaps needs 393 international migrants perhaps more than the reverse, questions remain about whether 394 Japanese society, led by government, is seriously prepared to facilitate positive mental 395 well-being to create a flourishing society together with migrants regardless of nationality 396 and socioeconomic status.397 There are limitations to this systematic review that should be noted. Most of the 398 studies reviewed were cross-sectional and therefore could only describe correlation and not 399 causation so the strength of actionable conclusions may be impacted. As a narrative 400 approach was taken to data synthesis, all studies were given an equal weight regardless of 401 size, level of significance and quality. Heterogeneity testing or subgroup analysis of the 402 surveyed literature were not done as part of a meta-analysis leaving the study qualitative in 403 nature. Additionally, while this review aimed to analyze all published literature on the topic 404 of migrant mental well-being in Japan, grey literature was not assessed. The strengths of 405 this systematic review are its comprehensive nature in terms of search strategy and data 406 analysis as well as examining publications published in Japanese. In this way readers can 407 understand the scope of mental well-being as representative of general migrant studies in 408 Japan.",

While motivated by push and pull factors based on perceived opportunity, international migration has been well-documented to be a stressful, multifactorial process that can adversely affect health.[2][3][4] The 'right to health' of migrants is enshrined in the Declaration of Alma-Ata (1978) and states receiving countries should take73 a comprehensive approach to health care of such sojourners beyond basic infectious disease control.[5] Accordingly, migration is increasingly recognized as a structural socioeconomic 75 force that influences health outcomes as a social determinant of health, in general, and mental health, in particular.[6, 7]    As the world's third largest economy, Japan was home to 2.2 million international migrants in October 2018. This figure represents about 2% of the national population and approximately 200,000 foreign nationals were newly settled during that year.[8] While the number of foreign residents settling in Japan continues to accelerate, the total population of Japan is predicted to decline by 31% from a peak of 126 million in 2016 to 87 million by 82 2060.[9] Japan is a harbinger of the future as the first nation in human history to experience population decline due to \"super-aging\". Other developed nations like Germany and Italy, are on a similar demographic trajectories and such changes will swiftly increase the proportion of comparatively young foreign national populations.[10] However, unlike other developed countries with a history of large-scale, institutional health research that includes For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml non-citizens,[11] in Japan, mainly exploratory research has been conducted on the health of migrants.Facing a serious demographic challenge, the Japanese government has begun to publicly acknowledge the need for more foreign workers; however, structural issues continue to perturb the humanistic integration of international migrants. For example, a discrimination in Japan, with 40% having been rebuffed when seeking housing and 25% had been denied a job due to their nationality.[12] Additionally, the Migration Integration Policy Index (MPIX) recently highlighted strict working visa requirements and a culture of 96 overwork and harassment in Japan leading to occupational morbidity;[13] such 'push' factors may impact the positive functioning of migrants as part of Japanese society. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as, \"a state of wellbeing where every individual can realize his or her own potential, can cope with the normal 100 stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to 101 her or his community\".[14] Mental well-being is a dual continuum that includes mental 102 health and positive functioning open to sociocultural interpretation and includes concepts 103 such as contentment, absence of negative life determinants, absence of disease, or Japan as a host nation, has a unique cultural and linguistic context in which the 106 mental well-being and related supports for migrants are likely impacted. To the best of our 107 knowledge, there has been no synthesis of the literature on the mental health or well-being",

Contrastingly, studies by Qu et al. and Tsuji et al. found longer stays to be associated with worse well-being among different migrant populations.[17, 68] These For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml",

Ten studies concluded being female was a barrier to mental well-being; only one study suggested the female sex to be a facilitator of mental well-being.[29] This outlier assessed support-seeking behaviors among students, perhaps suggesting that while female migrants to Japan experience more barriers to mental wellbeing, they are more likely to reach out for solutions than males; as has been shown For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml",

As might be expected, the most discussed recommendation was the implementation of various support systems ranging from Japanese language education, medical systems and personal support networks. Such supports, like the provision of translated information and consultation desks, may address barriers for migrants; encouragingly local authorities have or are planning to implement many such mechanisms.[78] Notably absent from such government-backed systems, however, is support for a comprehensive medical interpretation system for healthcare357 A more novel suggestion raised by fewer publications was the importance of transcultural education about diversity or appreciation of different cultural backgrounds. This due in part to generalization on the part of mass media and a general lack of awareness among the domestic population as the Japanese the word imin, immigrant, is generally only applied to low-skilled workers.[80] For example, representative studies called for a more positive characterization of migrants by the mass media while other authors stressed the importance of transcultural competence both in the workplace and medical centers by For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml",

Robust sampling in migration research is understood to be difficult because migrant populations are inherently mobile and often prefer to remain unidentified; thus, migrant research is chronically underfunded as research agencies are reluctant to award grants where rigorous methodology does not exist.[3] Most studies on migrant mental well-being in Japan were community-based and used convenience or snowball sampling. Unsurprisingly, study populations were small, as half of studies enrolled less than 119 participants and only one publication included explicit sample size calculations.[64] The study with by far the largest sample size, utilized government survey records from Hamamatsu, Ibaraki Prefecture, to study the social connectedness of 1,252 Brazilians migrants.[65] There were also four retrospective surveys of institutional medical records over several years identified by our study.[27, 52, 54, 60] Taking into account the difficulty of sampling, samples were viewed as often justifiable to measure specific communities but representative cross-sections of entire migrant populations. In contrast, in their systematic review of immigrant women in the perinatal period, Kita et al. surveyed more than ten studies with large samples sizes that reviewed Japanese medical or governmental records.[46] Improving the rigor in migrant health research in Japan will, require more analyses of health records and secondary analysis of government administered surveys like the large-scale surveys including migrants that are regularly carried out in the European Next, the representativeness of migrant sampling, in terms of proportionality to the For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml",

The most populous migrant populations represented in our study were Brazilian (37%), Chinese (27%), Filipino (8%) and Korean (4%). It seems that Brazilian migrants and students, particularly Chinese students, have received more research attention in Japan. In reality, according to theMinistry of Justice, the four most populous migrant nationalities as of 2018, in descending Nepalese and Vietnamese populations in Japan have exploded since 2015,[8] and related research is only just appearing in the literature. Such research biases are remarkable and may carry across migrant studies in Japan and should be addressed for accurate scoping of 395 migrant health.[83] Migrants to Japan are relatively understudied compared to migrants in other highincome countries, especially in terms of mental health status. While the may be due to their comparatively low proportion (>12% in both Germany and UK), Japanese society is at a critical juncture with new visa categories launched in April 2019 dramatically increasing the number of foreign workers.[84] Key health policy documents, such as the WHO Japan Health System Review, discuss health equity in depth but still only mention migrant health in passing.[85] As it becomes clear that Japan perhaps needs international migrants perhaps more than the reverse, questions remain about whether Japanese social leaders are prepared to facilitate positive mental well-being to create a flourishing society together with migrants regardless of nationality and socioeconomic status.There are limitations to this systematic review that should be noted.
