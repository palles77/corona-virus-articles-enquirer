High-level information such as a desired area or volume, or a particular topology are only implicitly specified. In this paper we develop a segmentation method with explicit bounds on the segmented area. Area constraints allow for the soft selection of meaningful solutions, and can counteract the shrinking bias of length-based regularization. We analyze the intrinsic problems of convex relaxations proposed in the literature for segmentation with size constraints. Hence, we formulate the area-constrained segmentation task as a mixed integer program, propose a branch and bound method for exact minimization, and use convex relaxations to obtain the required lower energy bounds on candidate solutions. We also provide a numerical scheme to solve the convex subproblems. We demonstrate the method for segmentations of vesicles from electron tomography images.",

            "text": "Image segmentation is a fundamental task in image analysis. Consequentially, a large number of segmentation methods have been developed ranging from local thresholding to methods using statistical models of shape variation (Pham et al., 2000; Sonka et al., 2008) . The simplest available segmentation methods rely on local pixel-by-pixel segmentation decisions such as Otsu thresholding or methods based on clustering. These fully-local decisions are often not sufficient and because they neglect spatial dependencies, they are sensitive to noise and not directly applicable if an object is defined by its boundary surface only (e.g., if only the cell membrane or a cell membrane surrogate is imaged, but an image of the entire cell is desired). To overcome these limitations, nonlocal approaches have been proposed based on intelligent local merging decisions or by formulating optimization problems incorporating spatial dependencies. The former class of methods encompasses region growing approaches such as the popular watershed segmentation (Sonka et al., 2008) . The latter class of methods includes active-contours and -surfaces (Sapiro, 2001) as well as general parametric models which may use statistical information on shape and/or appearance (Cootes et al., 2001; Pizer et al., 2003) .",

However, for less structured cases these methods are not applicable. In microscopy, for example, images often contain hundreds or thousands of cells, cell nuclei, or organelles, with possibly large variations in shape and a priori unknown locations. While local thresholding or active-contour-type models may be applied in such cases, they are often too generic, too sensitive to noise, or require the judicial placement of seed points to assure an appropriate segmentation result to avoid over-or undersegmentations.",

A possible option is to use information about simple geometric properties. In this paper we explore an approach for a segmentation with constraints on the segmentation area. Such a method can counteract potential leakage or shrinkage biases in a principled way. Such biases can be observed, for example, for active contour (Sapiro, 2001) or graph cut (Boykov and Funka-Lea, 2006) segmentations when boundary regularity is encouraged by penalizing a weighted length of the segmentation boundary. Area constraints may not be appropriate for all biomedical segmentation tasks; however there are a large number of problems in which reasonable area or volume intervals are known a priori. Our objective in this paper is not to perform an actual study for a particular biological problem, but rather to demonstrate the behavior of a segmentation method with areaconstraints on realistic image data. We use electron tomography datasets of synaptic vesicles and of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) implicated in the SARS-coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) replication (Knoops et al., 2008) .",

While area-constraints can formally easily be added to the optimization problems for segmentation, solving the problems is hard. However, if finding a globally optimal solution is not of concern and a good initial guess for a solution is available, one can resort to standard methods from constrained optimization. For example, a curve evolution approach with an area penalty can be used (Ayed et al., 2008) . Proposed numerical solution approaches to obtain a global optimum or a good approximation.",

Integer programming solves this problem by intelligent pixel-by-pixel searching.

We use homogeneous image regions for the B k , which can be derived from super-pixels (Vedaldi and Soatto, 2008; Comaniciu and Meer, 2002) or from an image oversegmentation using a watershed method (Vincent and Soille, 1991) . Formulation (3) is more general than a direct super-pixel segmentation (e.g., one can use seed regions covering only a subset of the image to guide the segmentation while having complete representational freedom close to putative segmentation boundaries). To define the B k , we use quick-shift (Vedaldi and Soatto, 2008) to find super-pixels and erode them so that they do not touch the potential segmentation boundaries. Quick-shift is an efficient mode-seeking algorithm based on medoid shift (conceptually similar to the popular mean-shift segmentation algorithms Comaniciu and Meer, 2002) . It provides a tuning parameter to control under-and over-fragmentation of modes and can therefore be used to indirectly control the number of selection regions to be detected. Our method is not dependent on quickshift, and other clustering methods such as mean-shift or k-means (Jain et al., 1999) could be substituted. Fig. 2 shows an illustration of the selection regions. In addition to the max-flow method addressed in this paper we expect this approach of facilitating area-constraints through selection regions also to be generally useful for other segmentation methods.",

Segmentation boundaries can pass through such ''don't care'' selection areas if desired. Specifically, if only a lower-bound is imposed, then the selection regions drive the actual segmentation values u s through the inequality u s P b k . Therefore setting a selection region to 1 forces the segmentation value u s to be 1 for s 2 B k . However, setting a selection region to 0 amounts to leaving the segmentation values u s free. Hence, the solution will neither be forced to 0 or 1 in such an area and can be completely determined pixel-wise by the underlying image. The segmentation will be robust to selection regions that cross segmentation boundaries as long as there are a sufficient number of selection regions on the inside of an object that can be set to 1 so that the segmentation naturally ''snaps'' into the desired location. However, when we enforce a lower and an upper bound, we need to be able to increase and decrease the natural size of an unconstrained segmentation by setting regions to 1 or 0 respectively. In this case, selection regions crossing segmentation boundaries will matter because they have to be set to either 0 or 1. Consequentially, enforcing an upper and a lower bound may produce results which are worse than enforcing only a lower bound. This problem could easily be avoided by moving from binary to ternary selection variables (0: set to zero, 1: set to one, 2: do not care). This would leave the overall approach intact, but would result in a slightly different branch and bound implementation, which is not our focus here.",

Images for the epithelial cells were obtained from the cell centered database (CCDB) of the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research (NCMIR -http://ccdb.ucsd.edu). The images for the synaptic vesicles were approximately at a resolution of (1.0 nm by 1.0 nm)/pixel and for the SARS-coronavirus at (1.2 nm by 1.2 nm)/pixel. These examples were chosen to demonstrate the properties of our developed area-constrained segmentation method, because segmentations for these electron tomography images are known to be challenging. For example, for the synaptic vesicle segmentation task the vesicle wall is not directly visible in the electron tomography image. Instead it needs to be inferred from the location of proteins (which appear dark) penetrating the vesicle wall which results in a ''noisy'' appearance of the vesicle wall. Further, a large number of vesicles can be found in one image. Vesicles are closely packed in some areas, which even experts can have difficulty outlining precisely. In our experiments a user was asked to place individual seed points at the center of the objects to be segmented. The selection areas were obtained by eroding a quick-shift segmentation of the complete image. The selection region closest to the user-placed seed point was set as a foreground seed, and the selection areas at the boundaries of a 100 \u00c2 100 pixel box centered at the seed point were set as background seeds.

Segmentation results for a slice of the SARS 6021 (top) and of the SARS 6022 (bottom) electron tomography image. Seed points were placed manually with a single mouse click. Without using an area constraint (red) only few of the vesicles are accurately segmented and in the majority of cases the segmentations are too small indicating that a short boundary length was favored over a segmentation at the desired location of the cell wall. Adding a lower bound on the area (blue) greatly improves the segmentation results. Though a bias for short segmentation boundaries is still present, most of the vesicles are segmented accurately. Since the SARS 6022 image appears less noisy many of the vesicles are also segmented correctly without using a segmentation area constraint.

Italicized results do not have significantly different mean in comparison to the best method. For these images with a clear vesicle boundary watershed segmentation, maxflow with a lower bound, and random walker segmentation work well. (Knoops et al., 2008) , this is a conservative lower bound on the area. Similar conclusions as for the synaptic vesicle experiment apply. However, since the images for the double membrane vesicles are significantly less noisy than the images for the synaptic vesicles watershed segmentation, random walker segmentation, as well as the area-constrained segmentation method, work well. The area-constrained segmentation method matches the performance of the best segmentation method (seeded watershed) for both SARS images. Generally, the segmentation using a lower bound on the segmentation area performed better than the unconstrained segmentation. Fig. 6 shows overviews of the resulting segmentations for SARS 6021 and 6022, respectively, for the unconstrained and the area-constrained segmentations. Table 2 gives an overview of the obtained Dice similarity coefficients.

The method readily extends to higher dimensions using higher-dimensional generalizations of the selection regions. The proposed method relies on the solution of a mixed integer nonlinear program, which is solved using branch and bound. To reduce computational effort in solving the area-constrained segmentation, we proposed to use selection variables based on eroded super-pixels. This allows computation of the segmentations for practical problems. The behavior of the method was demonstrated for segmentations of vesicles from slices of electron tomography images. When area-constraints were available, statistically significant increases in segmentation quality were obtainable even in challenging cases. In particular, due to the global optimality properties of the algorithm, it performs well for noisy data.",

Extensions to multiple objects or the inclusion of topological constraints (e.g., to enforce one connected component) are other possible research directions.",

The branch and bound solver selects (and sets) a subset of selection variables b k and leaves the remaining ones free. To obtain lower energy bounds and feasible solution to MINLP (given the selected b k ) we use a relaxed formulation. The relaxed formulation is solved by ADMM. We can compute a primal and a dual energy from ADMM. From the ADMM energies we can obtain finite primal and dual relaxed energies by projections. We can obtain a feasible MINLP solution from the projected solution from which the relaxed energy was obtained by thresholding. A current candidate branch is terminated if the relaxed dual energy is larger than the best feasible MINLP solution or if ADMM converged to a feasible MINLP solution. Note that the termination criteria can be checked before ADMM convergence. The branch and bound solver builds a search tree for all possible choices for the b k , but never evaluates branches which can be discarded. Dashed lines indicate possible (but difficult paths), solid lines indicate the proposed approach. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 4 As for Eq. (3), we allow inequalities for the selection regions when only enforcing",
