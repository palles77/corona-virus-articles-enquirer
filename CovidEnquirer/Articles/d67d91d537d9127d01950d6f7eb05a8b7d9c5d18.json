The aim of the present work was to study if maternal IgG1 antibodies (Abs) to BCoV acquired by colostrum intake modulate the development of BCoV infection in calves reared in a dairy farm in Argentina. Thirty Holstein calves were monitored during their first 60 days of age. Animals were classified into two groups depending on their initial BCoV IgG1 Ab titers. The ''failure of passive transfer'' (FPT) group had significantly lower IgG1 Abs to BCoV than the ''acceptable passive transfer'' (APT) group of calves (log10 1.98 vs. 3.38 respectively) (p < 0.0001). These differences were also observed when the total protein levels in both groups were compared (p = 0.0081). Moreover, 71% (5/7) of calves from the FPT group showed IgG1 seroconversion to BCoV compared to 29.4% (5/17) of animals from the APT group. Regarding viral circulation, BCoV was detected in 10% (3/30) of all calves and BCoV IgG1 Ab seroconversion was detected in 42% of the total animals showing that almost half of the calves were infected with BCoV. In conclusion, calves with high titers of specific BCoV IgG1 (\u22651024) were mostly protected against viral infection, while animals with low titers of IgG1 (<1024) were mostly infected with BCoV. IgG1 Abs from colostrum origin are critical for prevention of BCoV infection. BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). mostr\u00f3.

Animals were classified into the FPT (titers \u2264 256) and APT (titers \u2265 1024) groups depending on their initial BCoV IgG1 ELISA Ab titers (Fig. 1) . The IgG1 Abs to BCoV significantly differed between groups depending on the time (GLMM Group-Time F (5,120) = 12.17, p < 0.0001). The FPT group had significantly lower IgG1 Ab titers to BCoV than the APT calves for up to seven days after the beginning of the experiment. These significant differences were also observed when measuring total protein levels by refractometry (Kruskal---Wallis rank sum test, p = 0.0081) which is the preferred method used to measure colostrum Abs transfer under field conditions. As expected, the higher the initial level of IgG1 Abs in the calves' sera, the longest it took for them to decrease to a susceptible level. When BCoV IgG1 Ab titers decreased to 16 or 64, BCoV infection was evidenced by either virus detection in feces, or by a minimum 16-fold increase of anti-BCoV IgG1 ELISA Ab titers for around two weeks (defined as seroconversion for the purpose of this study) (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). Moreover, 71% (5/7) of calves from the FPT group showed BCoV IgG1 seroconversion between 14 and 21 days of the experiment while only 29.4% (5/17) of the animals from the APT group presented sequential seroconversion during the same period (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.085) ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). However, the moments of seroconversion in the different groups of calves are not necessarily correlated with the days of age because, as we mentioned before, the calves' age was between 1 and 10 days at the beginning of the experience. The APT group average age at day 0 of the experience was 2.8 days while the FPT group average age was 5.4 days (data not shown).",

The outcome of BCoV infection was clearly affected by passively acquired Abs from colostrum.

            "text": "Refractometry is the commonly used method for total protein measurement to evaluate colostrum intake in calves' serum. However, the exact titer of BCoV-specific IgG1 transferred to calves from maternal colostrum required to prevent BCoV diarrhea in the field remains unclear. Total protein level \u2265 5.2 g/dl (corresponding with IgG \u2265 1000 mg/dl) in serum from a healthy calf is considered to be an optimal level of protein transfer 39 . In this study, we observed a mean protein level of 7.1 g/dl which is optimal; however, the FPT group had a significantly lower level of total protein in serum than the APT group at day 0 of the experiment (Kruskal---Wallis non-parametric rank sum Test, p = 0.0081). This correlates with the higher detection of BCoV IgG1 Ab seroconversion in the FPT group compared with the APT animals. This study also aimed to further define BCoV pathogenesis, and to better understand BCoV-specific Ab kinetics. In Argentina, we previously reported a significantly higher rate of BCoV diarrhea in dairy herds compared to beef herds 6 . We detected viral shedding in a small number of animals but high viral circulation manifested through BCoV seroconversion. Low viral detection could be due to a lower sensitivity of ELISA compared with the RT-PCR assay to detect BCoV in feces 7 . However, another country from the southern hemisphere shows a low detection rate using RT-PCR 1 . BCoV shedding was detected at high titers during only two or three days differing with other experiments in which BCoV shedding was long lasting 23, 32 . This supports the idea of a lower sensitivity of the ELISA assay for BCoV detection used. Moreover, we showed that calves with high BCoV IgG1 Ab titers were often protected against infection, while animals with low BCoV IgG1 Ab titers showed significantly higher BCoV infection rates (p < 0.0001). On the one hand, BCoV infection dynamics was drastically affected by these Ab titers since 71% of FPT animals showed BCoV IgG1 seroconversion during the experiment. The significant difference in Ab titers at the beginning of the study was also associated with a significant difference in total protein levels. Furthermore, when IgG1 titers decreased over time and reached non-protective levels (BCoV IgG1 Ab titers of 16 or 64), calves seroconverted confirming BCoV infection, even when the antigen was not detected in the feces by the methodology used. On the other hand, 70.6% of animals from the APT group maintained elevated IgG1 Ab titers over time and only five calves eventually seroconverted. Moreover, calves with maternal BCoV IgG1 Ab titers of 4096 or higher seemed to be protected against BCoV infection over the course of this study, suggesting that specific IgG1 Abs from colostrum are critical for the prevention of BCoV infection 20 . Although there was a tendency to observe more BCoV IgG1 seroconversion in calves from the FPT group compared with calves from the APT group, this difference was not significant (Fisher's Exact Test, p = 0.085). This could be due to a low number of experimental units in the FPT group.",

However, vaccination success can be affected by several factors including deficiencies in herd management and varying vaccine quality 29 . As was mentioned previously, we have no information either about the vaccination of dams against neonatal diarrhea or about the quality of commercial CoVB vaccines. Therefore, Abs transferred to calves through colostrum intake might be due to previous exposure to BCoV or to an active immunization of the dam with this agent. The lack of a good passive immune transference in addition to a diet based on milk replacer might only have contributed to the occurrence of diarrhea in 100% of the studied animals. All calves suffered a severe and long lasting diarrhea (17 to 19 days). The etiology of diarrhea could be diverse since other infection agents were not discarded, and neither antibiotic nor anti-parasitic drugs were used as preventive strategies. BCoV infection was evidenced by antigen shedding or seroconversion in 42% of the calves, while RVA infection was evidenced by shedding in 50% of calves. Thus, RVA is a major agent associated with NCD, as has been reported elsewhere 1, 2, 13 .",
