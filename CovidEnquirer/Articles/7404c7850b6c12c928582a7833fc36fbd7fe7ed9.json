Many cases of acute diarrhea are self-limiting, even if mucosal damage is severe, because intestinal epithelial cell turnover is rapid and new, normal epithelial cells will quickly restore normal intestinal function. Treatment need only be supportive and symptomatic, since most animals that die from diarrhea do so not as a result of the underlying cause of diarrhea but from the loss of water and electrolyte imbalance, with subsequent dehydration, acidosis, and shock.
