These included osteopathic, naturopathic and chiropractic care, in addition to standard medical care. The U.S. Dept Health & Human Services lists three reasons why, at that time, standard medical care was ineffective. First, physicians mistakenly believed Pfeiffer's bacillus (rather than a virus) was responsible, despite a lack of supportive scientific evidence. Secondly, masks were relied upon despite their ineffectiveness with viruses (masks CAN prevent bacterial spread). Lastly, although few physicians believed in miasmas and imbalances in the humours, their remedies derived from these theories. (U.S. Dept Health & Human Services 2009) Magoun (2004) has presented a well-documented approach to osteopathic care at that time e with implications for those who have influenza nowadays, whether regular seasonal, Avian H5N1, or the current model, H1N1.

(Patterson 2000) . the American School of Osteopathy, now the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine . contacted all their alumni. This effort culminated in 2445 osteopaths responding in treating 110,122 patients with influenza, with a resulting mortality of 0.25%. One of the few osteopathic medical hospitals, 400-bed Massachusetts Osteopathic Hospital, in Boston, also reported a mortality of 0.25% for that period. (Walter 1992) Building on this historical evidence, Hruby & Hoffman (2007) note that, although there were no controlled studies (and no descriptive comparisons between MD and DO patients), osteopaths achieved a high success rate perhaps due to osteopathic manipulative therapy What treatment did osteopaths use OMT (osteopathic manipulative treatment) comprised a series of modalities that attempted to enhance thoracic mobility and lymphatic drainage, as well as liver, spleen and abdominal function.",

Also included are other OMT procedures that, although not thoroughly researched, have been clinically observed to provide similar effects.

Paulus (2006) articulates this view when he says that the ''quintessential goal'' of the osteopath should be to: ''diagnose the lack of motion and to help restore any quality of motion to the disordered region .. restoration of motion, not alignment of the musculoskeletal system, activates the therapeutic process that bring about healing.''",

Manual methods were applied to elderly hospitalized patients with pneumonia, Hospital time was reduced from a mean of 8.6 days without OMT to 6.6 days for those receiving OMT. Additionally OMT patients required less intravenous antibiotics Nicholas & Oleski (2002) Described a four-step protocol, composed of rib raising and treatment of the thoracic inlet, respiratory diaphragm, and pelvic diaphragm e for postoperative pain. ''Patients who receive morphine preoperatively and OMT postoperatively tend to have less postoperative pain and require less intravenously administered morphine. In addition, OMT and relief of pain lead to decreased postoperative morbidity and mortality and increased patient satisfaction. Also, soft tissue manipulative techniques and thoracic pump techniques help to promote early ambulation and body movement.'' Knott et al.
