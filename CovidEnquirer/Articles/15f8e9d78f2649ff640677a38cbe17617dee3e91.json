            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) can cause a lethal disease in cats, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). The antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection has been recognised in experimentally infected cats, and cellular immunity is considered to play an important role in preventing the onset of FIP. To evaluate the importance of cellular immunity for FIPV infection, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against feline interferon (fIFN)-g were first created to establish fIFN-g detection systems using the MAbs. Six anti-fIFN-g MAbs were created. Then, the difference in epitope which those MAbs recognise was demonstrated by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IFN-g neutralisation tests. Detection systems for fIFN-g (sandwich ELISA, ELISpot assay, and two-colour flow cytometry) were established using anti-fIFN-g MAbs that recognise different epitopes. In all tests, fIFN-g production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from cats experimentally infected with an FIPV isolate that did not develop the disease was significantly increased by heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation in comparison with medium alone. Especially, CD8 \u00fe fIFN-g \u00fe cells, but not CD4 \u00fe fIFN-g \u00fe cells, were increased. In contrast, fIFN-g production from PBMCs isolated from cats that had developed FIP and specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats was not increased by heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation. These results suggest that cellular immunity plays an important role in preventing the development of FIP. Measurement of fIFN-g production with the anti-fIFN-g MAbs created in this study appeared to be useful in evaluating cellular immunity in cats.",

            "text": "Development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to feline interferon (fIFN)-g as tools to evaluate cellular immune responses to feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) F eline coronavirus (FCoV) is a coronavirus belonging to group 1 of the family Coronaviridae. FCoV is classified into types I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its spike protein. 1e3 Each of these types consists of two viruses: feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-causing FIP virus (FIPV) and non-FIP-causing feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). 4 FIPV and FECV of the same type cannot be distinguished by their antigenicity or at the gene level, and differ only in their pathogenicity for cats. 5 Thus, there are types I and II FECV and FIPV in FCoV. FECV is asymptomatic in cats, 6 but FIPV infection can induce FIP, ie, FIPV is a virulence biotype of the FECV. 5 There is no detailed evidence, but it is thought that certain strains of FECV are more likely to mutate to FIPVs. 7, 8 FIP is a fatal disease, characterised by a monocyte-triggered vasculitis accompanied by pyogranulomatous inflammation. 5, 9 To prevent FIP, various vaccines, such as virulenceattenuated live or inactivated FIPV vaccines, have been investigated, but none have shown sufficient efficacy, and these vaccines rather enhance the development of FIP. 10e14 Intraperitoneal inoculation with FIPV induced more severe clinical signs in anti-FIPV antibody-positive kittens and kittens that received passive immunisation with serum or purified IgG from antibody-positive cats, compared to antibody-negative kittens. 15, 16 These results of experimental studies suggest that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection can be a serious obstacle to the prevention of FIP by vaccination. Potent cellular immunity was induced in FIPV-infected cats without FIP. 17e20 Cellular immunity is considered to play an important role in the prevention of FIP onset. 5 Thus, one safety concern regarding FIPV vaccine is that it may induce marked cellular immunity. 5,17e20 Therefore, evaluation of the cellular immune response is essential for the development of vaccines against FIPV infection.",

Sandwich enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ELISpot kits (R&D systems, USA) are commercially available for the measurement of secreted feline IFN (fIFN)-g. However, these fIFN-g-measuring kits are very expensive. In addition, they raise concerns about non-specific reactions due to the use of an anti-fIFN-g polyclonal antibody (PAb) as a capture and detection antibody.",

Noko 3-31.1 inhibited 80% or more of the binding of Noko 1-12.3, Noko 5-23.1, and Ame 4-12.4 to rfIFN-g. However, Noko 3-31.1 differed from these MAbs in that it showed neutralising activity against fIFN-g. Ame 6-31.1 and Ame 7-19.1 mutually inhibited 80% or more of their binding to rfIFN-g. Both showed neutralising activity against fIFN-g. However, they seemed to recognise different epitopes because of the different inhibition rates for Noko 3-31.1 and Noko 5-23.1. Thus, Detection of fIFN-g in the culture supernatants of PBMCs using sandwich ELISA PBMCs were isolated from FIPV-infected cats without FIP, FIP cats, and SPF cats and cultured for 9 days with or without a heat-inactivated FIPV. The fIFN-g concentrations in the culture supernatants were measured by sandwich ELISA. The combination of unlabelled capture MAb and biotinylated detection MAb, used in sandwich ELISA, was examined based on the results of competitive ELISA and IFN-g neutralisation tests. The results demonstrated that the detectability was highest when Ame 6-31.1 was used as a capture antibody and biotinylated Ame 4-12.4 as a detection antibody. The detection range of the assay was from 0.1 to 100 ng/ml.",

This role has been exploited to obtain important information on the specificity and efficacy of the cellular immune response. 31e33 Anti-IFN-g MAbs are used for detecting IFN-g production both directly and specifically. Sandwich ELISA is a simple and robust assay, and a good choice to quantitatively measure IFN-g.
