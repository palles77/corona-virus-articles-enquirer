Historically, all three places were one political entity until Hong Kong was ceded to the British from 1842 through 1997, and when Taiwan became a Japanese colony from 1895 until 1945, followed by the establishment of a separate government by the Nationalists (or Kuomintang) retreating from the Communists in 1949.",

Because Hong Kong and Taiwan are not member countries of the World Health Organization, although the former has observer status at the World Health Assembly, their health and health-care statistics are seldom published in international compendia, and comparative examination of the three systems has not been systematically undertaken and disseminated. The present article attempts to fill this gap in the literature.",

We then assess each system's performance on the equity and efficiency axes, in particular drawing on evidence from standardized health accounts and recent work by the 15-country, pan-Asian Equity in Asia-Pacific Health Systems or EQUITAP consortium. We show how policymakers are trying or might attempt to rise up to and overcome these key challenges in the medium-to longterm. Finally, we conclude with important lessons and various solution options that these three economies could learn from each other as well as across neighboring countries in East and South-East Asia.",

China's economic liberalization at the end of the 1970s was associated with a sharp drop in government fiscal revenues, and led to financial difficulties for many SOEs and a dismantling of village collective welfare funds (Zhu et al., 1989; Liu et al., 1995; Liu et al., 2001; Liu 2002) . The CMS all but collapsed, and GIS and LIS came under increasing financial strain. The government's initial response was to encourage government health facilities to supplement budget allocations with direct charges to patients. Despite increases in government health expenditure (GHE) (approximately 8% per year in real terms since the early 1990s), the public share of overall health spending declined steadily, reaching just 12% in 2003. Over the same period, government subsidies to providers accounted for a steadily declining share of operational expenses.",

Building on these experiences, a new urban employee health insurance system, the basic medical insurance (BMI), funded by a social coordinated medical fund in combination with personal medical savings accounts, was established in 1998. The scheme covers government agencies, state and collective enterprises, and private companies. Although the BMI aims at broad coverage, dependants of BMI participants, students, and the unemployed are not covered. Moreover, some employers, in particular in the private sector, have also opted to remain outside the scheme.",

Direct taxes contribute about one-half of government general revenue. Only 55% of the working population (3.3 million out of a total population of almost 6.9 million) in Hong Kong pay any income tax, and only the richest 1.4% of the working population fall into the top tax bracket (i.e. 16% flat tax), contributing 38.8% of total salaries tax receipts. Personal income tax constitutes one-third and corporate tax makes up one-half of all direct taxes. The remaining direct tax is property tax, which applies to the 60% of the population who live in private housing but not to the 40% that live in National Health Surveys (1993 , 1998 , 2003 government-subsidized housing. Because of its colonial background, Hong Kong has reproduced a tax-financed system as per the UK National Health Service as it developed the welfare state since the 1970s. Government general revenue has funded most of hospital care, initially through publicly operated facilities and subvention of hospitals run by charities, and since 1991 these have been consolidated under the single corporatized umbrella of the Hospital Authority. In contrast, most of ambulatory care has always been privately financed and provided where OOP payments are common, amounting to about one-third of total health expenditure, with limited prospective payment arrangements through employer-provided (mostly multinationals or large local firms), and to a much lesser degree self-purchased, medical insurance.",

Collectively, this had covered about 57% of the total population by 1995. The 43% uninsured, mostly consisting of the two age extremes with the highest health-care need, were nevertheless deterred from seeking necessary medical services, which predictably resulted in socially patterned access to care, as in China progressively since the 1980s, that was consistent with Tudor Hart's Inverse Care Law (Tudor Hart, 2000) .",

The government planned its new NHI system to achieve two essential objectives: providing equal access to health care for all citizens, and controlling total health spending within a reasonable level. The NHI provides a comprehensive benefit package that covers preventive and medical services, prescription drugs, dental services, Chinese medicine, and home nurse visits (Lu and Hsiao, 2003) . It is financed mainly through premiums (in the form of payroll tax) and supplemented with direct government funding, and it compensates a mixed health-care economy of public and private (dominant) providers predominantly on a fee-for-service basis (Chiang, 1997) . Population coverage in the NHI scheme had reached 99% by the end of 2004 (International Symposium on Achievements and Challenges of National Health Systems, 2005) . Therefore, both Taiwan and Hong Kong have now achieved universal coverage through social insurance and tax financing, respectively, which were instituted in tandem with their economic development (the former lags the latter by about 15 years).

The HA introduced a modern managerialist culture and improved quality, explicitly taking reference from parallel reforms in Britain's NHS; however, without concomitant increase in user fees. Cost recovery has remained at 3-5% for inpatient care and 10-15% for outpatient visits. This predictably attracted away 10-15% of total bed-days from the private sector, further consolidating the already dominant market position of the public sector to 95% inpatient bed-days, whereas private providers have consistently looked after 70-85% of outpatient episodes, in a compartmentalized (between levels of care and at the public-private interface) mixed medical economy (Hsiao and Yip, 1999; Leung et al., 2005) . The HA, as a result of the economic downturn from the late 1990s until 2004 and the ever-upward cost spiral associated with technology diffusion, has sustained annual structural deficits since 2001. At the same time, the government has been handicapped by popular pressure (where most enjoy essentially free health care because of Hong Kong's narrow tax base and HA's universal entitlement policy), bureaucratic inertia, and political paralysis (arising from strained executive-legislative relations resulting from post-repatriation constitutional adjustments) from making any meaningful change to the system despite numerous consultancies and reports that have warned of an unsustainable future Welfare Bureau 1993, 2001; Hsiao and Yip, 1999) .",

The Japanese policy of rapidly scaling up the supply of Western-style allopathic physicians and midwives extended into the Kuomintang-led era post-1945 (Hsiao et al., 1990) ; in contrast, the Japanese suppressed and eventually banned the practice of Chinese medicine, thus resulting in a drastic decrease of licensed Chinese medicine practitioners from 1903 to 24 (1901-1945) (Lin, 2004) . Through the aggressive advocating of the Chinese medicine practitioners themselves, the government finally resumed the licensing system for them in 1947. To enhance its scientific attributes and gain market competitiveness, the practice of Chinese medicine has been modernized through establishing medical training programs within the formal medical school education system, which enrolls 270 medical students yearly (people can also obtain a license to practice through completing the Professional and Technical Special Examinations for Doctors of Chinese Medicine and undertaking an 18-month clinical training program) (Lin, 2004) .

Since NHI was implemented in 1995, there has been further sustained capacity expansion in Taiwan. Table 4 compares the health-care establishment for the three economies in Greater China, which shows that Taiwan has more than 15% more beds than Hong Kong in three times as many hospitals per 100 000 population, but providing only about half as many inpatient episodes per capita. Most of Taiwan's health providers operate in the private sector, where 86% of hospitals or 66% of all hospital beds, and 97% of clinics (including some with short-stay beds) are privately owned (Chang, 2001 (Chang, , 2003 Department of Health, 2005) . Therefore, there has been increasingly fierce competition for and inducement of patient demand. Recent research has shown that competition, mostly through non-price strategies, has intensified since 1995, particularly in the high-margin, competitive market of inpatient care. For instance, many hospitals are quick to adopt and exploit new medical technology to compete for patients (Lu and Hsieh, 2003) . By comparison, Taiwan and Hong Kong have similarly high (benchmarked against Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries) levels of outpatient utilization, distributed more or less similarly across Western allopathic, Chinese medicine, and emergency care and generated by about the same number of Western allopathic doctors per capita, although the population-standardized ratio of Chinese medicine providers registered in Taiwan is approximately one-sixth of Hong Kong's (Table 4 ). However, like the deep urban-rural divide in China and indeed in many Western countries with expansive land mass and uneven population densities, Taiwan's overcapacity varies unevenly by geography and between specialties (as physicians trade off risk, workload, lifestyle, and reward) (Cheng, 2003) .

Two yardsticks often used are 'equity' and 'efficiency,' with the latter being assessed in terms of how well the system deals with 'market failures' -instances in which a free market would produce socially inefficient outcomes. 'Externalities' and 'public goods' are a key pair of market failures in the health sector; together they provide the economic rationale for public health programs. 'Adverse selection' in insurance is another -some people are more likely to fall sick than others and can conceal this information from a prospective insurer. The final type of market failure is known as 'moral hazard.' Once insured, patients have an incentive to overconsume health care. This tendency will be reinforced if providers have a financial incentive to deliver extra care, and if, as is likely, providers are better informed than both patients and insurers about the patient's medical needs. Demand-side moral hazard will be reinforced by supply-side moral hazard; the effect will be upward pressure on health-care costs.",

This results in part because nearly half goes toward supporting urban health insurance schemes, the members of which are disproportionately from the higher income groups, even within urban areas. But it also reflects the heavy concentration of supply-side subsidies in urban hospitals (Ministry of Health, 2004) . Furthermore, there are large geographic inequalities in government health spending favoring richer localities, because China's intergovernmental fiscal system does relatively little to break the link between a province's per capita income and the resources it has available for government spending. Table 6 summarizes observed inequalities across the three economies and shows the rich-poor and urban-rural divide that characterizes the current Chinese health system. Some think that China's government ought to be doing more on public health.

In part, this discrepancy reflects the fact that the survey-based estimates do not include preventive visits, but other factors may also be important. with fiscal decentralization, appears to have impacted negatively on the coverage of personal public health interventions, such as immunization, and is also believed to have hindered the development of public-goodtype programs such as disease surveillance, especially in poor areas.",

Health-care costs have risen rapidly in recent years. One study found that 20% of expenditures associated with the treatment of appendicitis and pneumonia were clinically unnecessary (Liu and Mills, 1999) . China has one of the highest shares of pharmaceutical expenditures in total health expenditure in the world-46.2% in 2003, compared to an average of around 15% in the OECD, 8.4% in Hong Kong, and 22.8% in Taiwan (Table 1) . One study of village clinics found that only 0.06% of drug prescriptions were reasonable (Zhang et al., 2003) . In an attempt to curb overuse of services among the urban insured, China introduced demand-side cost-sharing by getting patients to pay a sizeable fraction of the cost of care out of their own pocket, through a complex system of medical savings accounts (MSAs). These may have done more harm than good: their effects on use appear to have been limited (Yip and Hsiao, 1997) , but they do seem likely to have caused financial hardship by limiting the amount the scheme will reimburse. More successful, it seems, has been the introduction in a limited number of localities of supply-side The prices of some drugs are regulated.

NCMS is to be subsidized where central government subsidies are to be targeted toward the country's poorer central and western provinces, and reinforced by subsidies from provinces to counties. The new medical assistance (MA) program is geared toward the poor. Both will help improve equity, but neither is likely to eliminate the pro-rich bias in government health spending. One option would be to reduce the emphasis on programs that disproportionately benefit the better off, such as government support to urban insurance and supply-side subsidies to hospitals, and to increase the share of spending going to pro-poor programs, such as central government spending on the NCMS. Another option is to keep the spending mix the same but reduce the degree to which pro-rich spending items benefit the better off, and increase the degree to which pro-poor items benefit the poor. Through changes to the contribution schedules, some existing government expenditure on urban health insurance could be redirected to making insurance more affordable for the poor. Supplyside subsidies could be targeted increasingly to lower-level facilities used by China's rural poor rather than to city hospitals. Central government support to the new rural insurance scheme could be targeted increasingly to poorer provinces. Many other options are possible.",

Geographical disparities in local government spending on public health remain an issue. Tighter targeting of resources from central or provincial government would be one option.

On the other hand, the process of economic reform and modernization may further facilitate the industrialization of Chinese traditional therapies in the form of standardized pills and ampoules that are subjected to western-style drug regulatory processes including randomized, placebo-controlled testing. The challenge will remain sorting out truly efficacious niche roles of Chinese medicine that are truly integrative with Western allopathy.

There is also anecdotal evidence to suggest that more generally Hong Kong people place considerable emphasis on individual responsibility (i.e., there is declining solidarity) for health care, and that attitudes to equity have changed from the 1970s and 1980s when the territory was transitioning through economic development (Fung et al., 1999; Health Welfare and Food Bureau, 2004) .

Notwithstanding its narrow tax base and low contribution rates, which essentially funds almost all inpatient and some outpatient care, Hong Kong only spends 5.0% of GDP on health overall.

Facing a nearly depleted reserve in 2005, NHI quickly promulgated a series of 'multi-facet micro-tuning' programs to expand the revenue base and further contain cost, but it deliberately circumvented further increase in the contribution rate across the board. Specifically, the contribution cap was raised so that the highest earning base became 8.3 times that of the lowest; tobacco tax was doubled; and new budgets were sought to finance high-priority and easily identifiable items such as preventive interventions, infection control, and medical education in the form of teaching cost from relevant government agencies.

In contrast, provision of unnecessary care and drugs is a welldocumented problem in both China and Taiwan. Taiwan has made important strides in addressing this problem, primarily through the introduction of new forms of provider payment and efforts to separate drug prescription and dispensing functions.
