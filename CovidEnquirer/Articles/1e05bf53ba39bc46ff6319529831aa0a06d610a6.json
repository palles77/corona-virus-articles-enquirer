            "text": "Introduction The common cold is the most common infectious disease affecting humans. It is usually a selflimiting disease; however, the common cold can cause significant morbidity and has a substantial economic impact on society. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), which cause up to two-thirds of colds, have temperaturedependent replication and most HRV strains replicate optimally at 33\u00b0C. Delivery of heated, humidified air to the upper airways has the potential to reduce viral replication, but evidence of the effectiveness of this treatment of the common cold is inconclusive. We plan to test the hypothesis that delivery of humidified air heated to 41\u00b0C at high flow, nasal high flow rhinothermy (rNHF), for 2 hours daily for five days is more effective in reducing common cold symptom severity and duration than five days of 'sham' rhinothermy. Methods and analysis This is a randomised, single-blind, parallel-group trial comparing rNHF to 'sham' rhinothermy in the treatment of common cold. We plan to recruit 170 participants within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms of common cold and randomise them 1:1 to receive one of the two treatments for five days. The study duration is 14 days, which includes clinic visits on the first day of randomisation and four days post-randomisation, and a phone call on the 14th day. Participants will complete daily symptom diaries which include a symptom score, the Modified Jackson Score (MJS). The primary outcome is the MJS after four days. Ethics and dissemination New Zealand Ethics Registration: 17/STH/174. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, presented at academic meetings, and reported to participants. trial registration number U1111-1194-4345 and ACTRN12617001340325; Pre-results.",

            "text": "The common cold is the most common infectious disease affecting humans. 1 The common cold is a viral upper respiratory tract infection with typical symptoms that include nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat and cough. 2 Many viruses cause the common cold but human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most frequent pathogen. 3 On average, adults have two to four colds per year. 2 The mean duration of symptoms of the common cold is reported to be between seven and 10 days and it is usually a self-limiting disease. 2 However, the common cold can cause significant morbidity and has a substantial economic impact on society. In the USA alone, non-influenza viral respiratory tract infections cause an estimated 20 million lost workdays, 110 million physician visits and 6 million emergency department visits annually, 4 producing an economic burden of US$40 billion each year. 4 Furthermore, HRV infection poses particular risks to those with other comorbidities, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where they are a major cause of disease exacerbations. 5 6 No effective treatment has been identified for the common cold and current treatments are mainly symptomatic. There are many strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba The 35 L/min flow rate using the nasal high flow rhinothermy device will enhance the delivery of heated, humidified air to the upper airways. \u25ba Use of 'sham' rhinothermy ensures an appropriate control treatment. \u25ba Nasopharyngeal samples allow subgroup analysis of subjects which are PCR positive for specific respiratory pathogens. \u25ba It is not possible to blind the investigators to the interventions being administered.",

The evidence for the effectiveness of many of these is inconclusive or, at most, demonstrates a limited benefit for symptom reduction. 3 rhinothermy HRVs cause up to two-thirds of colds, and importantly for the hypothesis tested in this research, have temperature-dependent replication. 7 The antiviral effect of temperature on HRVs has been investigated in vitro.

Studies conducted in vivo have delivered heated and humidified air to participants at a range of temperatures, from 40\u00b0C to 44\u00b0C, 8 12-15 and using a variety of devices, including an anaesthetic mask 12 and steam-venting nozzles held a distance away from the nares. 8 13-15 These delivery systems may be inefficient and inconsistently deliver humidified air to the upper airways at the desired temperatures. A recent Cochrane systematic review of six rhinothermy studies in which participants with the common cold were treated with heated, humidified air did not show any harms or benefits, but advised cautious interpretation of the evidence, concluding that its quality was low grade. 1 The review recommended that further double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed, which provide definitive diagnosis derived from viral cultures and use uniform symptom scores. 1 It is evident that future trials should use standardised treatment modalities, which effectively and consistently raise the temperature of the upper airways for the duration of treatment.",
