            "text": "Viruses are perpetuated as a consequence of many rounds of persistent or acute infections, with possible extracellular stages in which genomes remain basically invariant. Despite lacking direct evidence, we presume that multitudes of successive transmissions have allowed viruses to survive at least for thousands of years, probably undergoing continuous genetic change. Picornavirologists are familiar with an Egyptian stela dated 1550-1333 B.C. (18th Egyptian dynasty) that portrays the image of a man with an atrophic leg probably a consequence of infection with poliovirus (PV) or a related virus (Eggers, 2002) . In this chapter we deviate from the focus on how viral population numbers affect short-term survival and evolution, and we turn to features of viruses as they infect successive hosts to persist in nature. Viruses can be transmitted vertically or horizontally. Vertical transmission occurs from parental organisms to their offspring, and it includes infection through the germ line in animals and plants, from the mother to the embryo during fetal development, and also postnatal transmission to the newborn via blood, milk, or contact (Mims, 1981; Nash et al., 2015) . In the horizontal transmission, a virus spreads from infected individuals to susceptible recipients. This is the type of transmission we are most familiar with. It frequently gives rise to disease outbreaks (infection episodes localized in space and time that affect a few individuals), epidemics (that affect an ample geographical area and are often extended in time), and pandemics (that affect most areas of our planet), typically the periodic influenza pandemics.",

            "text": "All transmission modes have probably contributed to the maintenance of viruses in our biosphere. Persistent infections are likely to have played a major role when the number of individual humans or animals living in close contact was limited throughout the preagricultural era, earlier than 10,000 years ago. A favorable climate change during the Holocene (the geological epoch that began at the end of the Pleistocene, around 12,000 years before present; compare with Chapter 1) was probably an important driver toward large-scale domestication of plants and animals, 10,000-7000 years B.C. From the behavior of current viruses, there might have always been a dynamics of virus change for adaptability within individual hosts, and transmissions among animals or plants. The probability of transmission increased as host population numbers rose with agricultural practices and urban life in the last several thousand years. Intensive agriculture must have contributed to accelerated sequence space exploration by viruses with consequences for the emergence of viral disease (Section 7.7). There has been probably a continuous dynamics of viral emergences, reemergences, and extinctions with patterns that may be parallel to those observed with present-day viruses. Virology has existed as an organized scientific discipline with the possibility to isolate, store, and study viruses only for about one century. The challenge to reconstruct the events that might have led to viruses similar to the ones we isolate today was addressed in Chapter 1, with a critical first question being if viruses originated 4000 million years ago, or \"only\" 2000 million years ago (diagrams in Figures 1.3 and 1.4, and Section 1.5 in Chapter 1). In this chapter, we are more modest in our aspirations and we will analyze with the tools of genomics what happens when viruses evolve for months or years in what we call interhost virus evolution.",

At most, decades-old biological samples containing viruses (such as those from lung specimens or a frozen body infected with the incorrectly called \"Spanish\" influenza of 1918) have been preserved, and sequences have been retrieved. Fortunately, there is a different type of \"molecular fossil\" record of viral genomes in the DNA of differentiated organisms, in the form of integrated virus-like genetic elements. This research area is termed Paleovirology (Aswad and Katzourakis, 2012) . The presence of recognizable viral genomic sequences in cellular DNA suggests a history of long-term interaction between viruses and cells, in support of some models of virus origins that propose a long coevolution between precellular and cellular entities with virus-like elements (Chapter 1). Despite the current capacity to amplify tiny amounts of viral nucleic acids for nucleotide sequence determinations, proposals on how long-term viral evolution might proceed have to be based mainly on the comparison of viral genomes and the structure of viral proteins from modern representatives of different virus groups. First we should understand the basic concepts related to virus transmission, keeping in mind viral population numbers and the complexity of viral populations.",

            "text": "The basic reproductive ratio (R 0 ) is the average number of infected contacts per infected individual. At a population level, a value of R 0 larger than 1 means that a virus will continue its propagation among susceptible hosts, if no environmental changes or external influences intervene. A R 0 value lower that 1 means that the virus is doomed to extinction at the epidemiological level under those specific circumstances. The basic models of infection dynamics were developed by R.M. Anderson, R.M. May, and M.A. Nowak, with inclusion of the following key parameters: rate k at which uninfected hosts enter the population of susceptibles (x), their normal death rate (u) (so that the equilibrium abundance of uninfected hosts is k/u), number of infected hosts (y), mortality due to infection (v) (so that 1/u + v is the average lifetime of an infected host), a rate constant (\u03b2) that characterizes parasite infectivity (so that \u03b2x is the rate of new infections and \u03b2xy is the rate at which infected hosts transmit the virus to uninfected hosts). These parameters are schematically indicated in Figure 7 .1 and they provide a theoretical value for R 0 (Anderson and May, 1991; Nowak and May, 2000; Nowak, 2006) . R 0 values are not a universal constant for viruses because, as discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, virus variation may affect viral fitness and viral load in infected individuals, and the latter, in turn, may influence the amount of virus that surfaces in a host to permit transmission. Despite uncertainties, consistent R 0 values have been estimated for different viral pathogens based on field observations. Values of R 0 for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus range from 2 to 5, for PV from 5 to 7, for Ebola virus from 1.5 to 2.5. For measles virus (MV), which is one of the most contagious viruses described to date, the R 0 reaches 12-18 (Heffernan et al., 2005; Althaus, 2014) . Most isolates of the SARS coronavirus that circulated months after the emergence of this human pathogen had modest R 0 values, and this is consistent with SARS not having reached the pandemic proportions feared immediately following its emergence. In contrast, MV is highly transmissible, thus explaining frequent outbreaks as soon as a sizable population stops vaccinating its infants. Since some of the parameters that enter the basic equations of viral dynamics depend on the nucleotide sequence of the viral genome, mutations may alter R 0 values, allowing some virus variants to overtake those that were previously circulating in the population (Figure 7 .2). Viral replication, fitness, load, transmissibility, and virulence are all interconnected factors that contribute to virus persistence in its broader sense of virus being perpetuated in nature. These parameters can affect both disease progression in an infected individual and transmissibility at the epidemiological level. A schematic representation of the main parameters of viral dynamics that enter the equations that predict the rate of variation of uninfected and infected (internal horizontal lines in the human figure) individuals (shaded box on the left) and the R 0 value (shaded box on the right). The meaning of parameters and literature references are given in the text. 7.2 REPRODUCTIVE RATIO AS A PREDICTOR OF EPIDEMIC POTENTIAL The difference between the numbers of infectious particles that participate in transmission versus the total number of virus in an infected, donor organism provides a first picture of the indeterminacies involved in viral transmissions. The larger the population size and genetic heterogeneity of the virus in an infected individual, the higher will be the likelihood that independent transmission events have different outcomes. Individual susceptible hosts will receive subsets of related but nonidentical genomes. In a bright article that emphasized the molecular evidence and medical implications of quasispecies in viruses, J.J. Holland and colleagues wrote the following statement: \"Therefore, the acute effects and subtle chronic effects of infections will differ not only because we all vary genetically, physiologically, and immunologically, but also because we all experience a different array of quasispecies challenges. These facts are easily overlooked by clinicians and scientists because disease syndromes are often grossly similar for each type of virus, and because it would appear to make no difference in a practical sense. However, for the person who develops Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome following a common cold, or for the individual who remains healthy despite many years of HIV-1 infection, for example, it may make all the difference in the world\" (Holland et al., 1992) . Indeterminacies in the process of virus spread can be viewed as an extension of the diversification due to bottleneck events in the case of virus transmission, as visualized in Figures 6.1 and 6.2 in Chapter 6, when dealing with the limitations of the virus samples retrieved from an infected host as the starting material for experimental evolution approaches. Displacement of a virus variant by another, by virtue of the latter displaying a higher R 0 value. The competing viruses are depicted as horizontal lines with a distinctive symbol. Differences in R 0 recapitulate part of the determinants of epidemiological fitness (Section 5.9 in Chapter 5). Concepts of competition among clones or populations within infected host organisms or cell cultures, treated in previous chapters, can be extended at the epidemiological level, with the appropriate choice of the key parameters.

Yet, its mutation frequencies, measured by independent procedures are in the range of 7 \u00d7 10 \u22123 to 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (see also Section 7.4.2).

Thus, a rate of evolution is far from being a universal feature of a virus. A comparison of rates of synonymous substitutions (under the assumption that synonymous substitutions do not affect protein function; see Chapter 2 for limitations of considering synonymous mutations as neutral) for several RNA viruses, yielded a range of evolutionary rates of 6 \u00d7 10 \u22122 to 1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per year (Hanada et al., 2004) . The values were recalculated from primary phylogenetic data using maximum likelihood (ML) (Section 7.6), under the assumption of the molecular clock, and inference of the ancestral nucleotide sequences at the tree nodes. The five orders of magnitude variation were attributed mainly to the degree of virus replication rather than to differences in error rate. We will deal with the molecular clock hypothesis (constant rate of accumulation of mutations) in Section 7.3.3, but the major features of virus evolution studied in previous chapters (mainly those typical of mutant swarm-forming RNA and DNA viruses) should make us skeptical of similar evolution rates in different biological contexts. Rate variations were documented with HIV-1 subpopulations in different compartments of the human brain . The data did not fit a \"global\" molecular clock for the virus in the brain, and \"local\" clocks showed that meninges and temporal lobe HIV-1 subpopulations evolved 30 and 100 times faster, respectively, than other HIV-1 populations in the brain. It is believed that these differences were due to random drift rather than selection. An additional complication is that even restricting virus isolations to the same biological material in a standard epidemiological setting, several measurements indicated discontinuities in evolutionary rates. The discontinuities had at least two origins: the nonlinear effect of time, and some unique features of evolution occurring inside an infected host. These points are examined next.",

Estimates of the rate of evolution of the virus ranged from <4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 to 4 \u00d7 10 \u22122 s/nt/y, depending on the genomic region analyzed, and the time period between isolations (Sobrino et al., 1986) . Cocirculation of multiple heterogeneous foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) samples (\"evolving quasispecies\") was proposed. The result to be emphasized here is that the calculated rates of evolution were extremely high (higher than 10 \u22122 s/nt/y) if the two FMDVs compared were isolated at close time points, while lower values were calculated when the viruses were sampled from different animals at distant time points.",

Some viruses remain infectious in the environment for prolonged time periods, until they reach a susceptible host in which to initiate replication rounds. This is the case of viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route such as enteroviruses. FMDV can adhere and remain infectious on many objects (fomites), including dust particles, food products with neutral pH, or insects that can transport the virus mechanically. Infectious FMDV can traverse long distances (many kilometers) on dust particles, people, trains, and the like. Even if some infectivity is lost, a few infectious particles are sufficient to infect an animal (Sellers, 1971 (Sellers, , 1981 . There are some classic examples of long-distance transport of FMDV, a virus subjected to close scrutiny due to its economic impact. One is the spread of SAT1 and A22 FMDV during the 1960s in Turkey along the railway line from the cattle raising region of Lake Van to slaughterhouses in Istambul [this and other examples are described in (Brooksby, 1981) ]. Computer models have been developed to explain and predict possible airborne FMDV transmission in different geographical areas (Sorensen et al., 2000) . [As an anecdote, in my experience as a member of the Research Group of the Standing Technical Committee for the Control of FMD of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in the 1980s, FMD outbreaks in any country always came from somewhere else.].",

Animals sustain the replication (inside curved arrow) of virus that will be transmitted to a susceptible animal. The time that the virus spends outside an animal (absence of replication) is depicted by a horizontal arrow. The time between virus isolation is given by t1, t2, and t3. The number of nucleotide differences in the virus isolates relative to the sequence of the initial (reference) animal is given by d1, d2, and d3 (vertical arrows). Because of the increasing periods of stasis (addition of horizontal arrows), calculated rates of evolution given by the d/t ratio will be higher the shorter the time interval between isolations. See text for references. so on. (iii) In this case, virus transport is assumed to be mechanical (on dust particles carried by wind, aerosols, insects, etc.) without additional viral replication during transport. Yet, subpopulations of the most environment-resistant particles, or particles that adhere best to the transporter object, may bias the composition of the virus that will reach an animal to pursue replication. Such events, occurring for ten to hundred rounds of host infections, render the appalling virus diversity described in Chapter 1 a bit less appalling. Since several additional environmental circumstances are changeable and unpredictable, it is unlikely that rates of viral evolution in nature can remain invariant on the basis of some internal principle of constant mutation occurrence (as if accumulation of mutations was as monotonous as radioactive decay!).",

Several proposals have been made to account for this difference. A.J. Leslie and colleagues described cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-escape mutants of HIV-1 from infected patients. Some of the mutants reverted to the wild-type sequence after transmission to individuals negative for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles associated with long-term HIV-1 control (Leslie et al., 2004) . Strong intrahost selective pressures and reversion of part of the selected mutations upon transmission to a susceptible individual is one of the possible mechanisms behind diminished evolutionary rates when viruses from multiple hosts are compared (Figure 7 .4, Box 7.1).",

Mullins, and colleagues systematically observed lower nucleotide sequence divergence between HIV-1 isolates from different individuals sampled in primary infection than between isolates from individuals with advanced illness. HIV-1 regained some ancestral features when infecting a new host, again explaining a higher intrahost than interhost evolutionary rate (Herbeck et al., 2006) . In a study of HIV-1 transmission between several pairs of individuals over an 8-year period, A.D. Redd and colleagues reported that the viral populations found in the newly infected recipients were more closely related to ancestral sequences from the donor than to the sequences found in the donor near the time of transmission (Redd et al., 2012) . Preferential transmission of ancestral sequences may also contribute to lower interhost than intrahost rates of evolution (Box 7.1). K.A. Lythgoe and C. Fraser provided evidence that cycling of HIV-1 through long-lived memory CD4 + T cells is probably the main contributing factor to slower HIV-1 evolution at the epidemic level (Lythgoe and Fraser, 2012) . Ancestral sequences of HIV-1 in infected individuals may arise by the activation of proviral sequences kept in the form of quasispecies memory. In this case, it is the type of molecular memory that we defined as reservoir, anatomical, or cellular memory in Section 5.5 of Chapter 5. A related type of reservoir memory is found in HBV, in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) that persists in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes, and acts as a template for the synthesis of pregenomic RNA and viral mRNAs (Kay and Zoulim, 2007) . In this case, a record of ancient sequences is registered in the cccDNA. It should be noted that memory levels are dependent on fitness values, as evidenced experimentally with FMDV and expected from the theoretical basis of memory implementation (Chapter 5). In consequence, the most abundant memory genomes established early in an infection might be those displaying the highest fitness early in infection, and they might be better adapted to initiate infections than to sustain them (Figure 7 .4).",

Permanence of viral genomic sequences in cellular DNA is a mechanism of evolutionary stasis, as it was emphasized in Chapter 3 with the comparison of the evolutionary rate of the retroviral v-mos gene and its cellular counterpart c-mos (Gojobori and Yokoyama, 1985) , among other evidence. Considerable evolutionary stasis is also observed by comparing isolates of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 whose replication displays preference for maintaining its integration in cellular DNA (Melamed et al., 2014) .

The differences were mainly due to nonsynonymous substitutions at limited sites.

The authors referred to the colonization-adaptation trade-off (CAT) model, or alternations of virus facing an environment marked by a limited host immune response followed by a period of active immune response. In the former environment, viruses displaying rapid replication are selected, while in the latter environment, HBV escape mutants with lower productivity are selected.

Some of the mechanisms involve viral population numbers and competition among subpopulations of mutant spectra as critical ingredients. The molecular clock hypothesis dwindles as a conceptual framework because from all evidence, virus evolution is far from being dictated by a steady accumulation of mutations in viral genomes. The major event is \"replacement of subpopulations\" rather than \"accumulation of mutations in genomes.\" This conceptual change is as important for the long-term evolution of viruses as it was the consideration of the wild type as a cloud of mutants in the definition of a viral population (Chapter 3).",

According to the clock hypothesis, the rate of accumulation of mutations coincides with the rate at which mutations arise in the infected individuals. This holds for neutral mutations and, as documented in several chapters of this book, very few mutations occurring in highly compact viral genomes are truly neutral (with no functional consequences in any environment; see Section 2.3 in Chapter 2). Even for neutral evolution, spatial asymmetries in populations are sufficient to perturb the molecular clock rate, as documented with a theoretical model of broad applicability (Allen et al., 2015) . Yet, quasispecies and the operation of a clock are not totally irreconcilable. An epidemiological study with FMDV suggested that viral quasispecies could produce a transient molecular clock due to the periodic sampling of components of the mutant spectrum in transmission (Villaverde et al., 1991) . In this case, both time differences between transmissions and spatial heterogeneities would blur the transiently observed regularity.",

Remarkably, the antigenic variation over six decades was due to fluctuations among limited combinations of amino acid residues without net accumulation of amino acid substitutions over time (Figure 7 .5).

For the latter group of viruses, the same vaccine can maintain its efficacy over many decades; examples are rabies virus (RV) and MV, two RNA viruses that show remarkable genetic diversity in nature, and estimates of mutation rates and frequencies comparable to other RNA viruses. Antigenic constancy versus variation is also a determinant of long-lasting immunity after infection or vaccination. MV infection produces lifelong immunity (probably as a result of several factors) while patients that have cleared hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be re-infected by the same virus. Cases of patients infected with HCVs of different genotypes are increasingly identified, as more refined diagnostic tests are utilized. No correlation between virus structure (or morphotype) and antigenic diversity has been found. Among structurally closely related viruses, differences in antigenic diversity are apparent. A dramatic case is that of the picornaviruses since encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or hepatitis A virus (HAV) have a single serotype, while human rhinoviruses (HRVs) have been divided into more than 100 serotypes. Other picornaviruses have intermediate numbers of serotypes: three in the case of PV and seven in the case of FMDV. Although it may seem that a diverse antigenic structure may predict a broad host range, this is actually not the case. HAV is highly specialized for the human host while EMCV infects more than 30 species, including mammals, birds, and invertebrates (Knowles et al., 2010) .

First, as a conceptual precision, we assume that the number of serotypes is essentially determined by amino acid sequences located in the virus particle, and that either directly or indirectly can affect the interaction of virus with antibodies. Neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies may contribute to serological distinctions, depending on the assays performed for serotyping. Serum neutralization tests will identify differences in sensitivity to neutralization while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests will capture reactivity by all raised antibodies. Antibodies can be obtained from infected natural hosts, or from some laboratory animals which are not a natural host for the virus. An ensemble of amino acid residues forms an antigenic determinant which is usually composed of multiple epitopes [defined here as a unit of interaction with a monoclonal antibody (MAb)]. Epitopes can be either continuous (also termed linear) or discontinuous (also termed structured). Continuous epitopes are those whose primary amino acid sequence has the information to react with the cognate antibody. Discontinuous epitopes are those whose reactive residues come from distant positions of the same protein or from residues of different proteins. Many overlapping epitopes can be found within the same antigenic site. Epitopes can include modified amino acid residues such as glycosylated amino acids. Reactivity of discontinuous epitopes with the cognate antibody is generally lost as a consequence of denaturation of the proteins that form the epitope.",

Influences such as nucleotide sequence context or RNA structure may conceivably alter mutation rates. It was proposed that a predicted double-stranded RNA at the region encoding the major antigenic site of FMDV might increase locally the polymerase error rate and give rise to multiple amino acid substitutions (Weddell et al., 1985) . While at some specific sites polymerases may be more error prone than average, subsequent evidence for FMDV indicated that antigenic variation is due to amino acid substitutions at different antigenic sites and that even variation at the major site can be mediated by distant amino acids on the viral capsid (Rowlands et al., 1983; Geysen et al., 1984; Mateu et al., 1990; Feigelstock et al., 1996) . Later molecular studies have not provided evidence that viruses may have a large number of serotypes because their polymerases are more error prone when copying regions encoding amino acids that belong to antigenic sites.

Indeed, there is no universal procedure used to classify viruses serologically, and, therefore, strictly speaking, there in the possibility that different numbers may be obtained using alternative classification procedures. FMDV is a pertinent example. Its seven serotypes are defined on the basis of a very stringent test that cannot be performed with a human virus for obvious reasons: absence of cross protection resulting from vaccination or infection with a given FMDV. Infection or vaccination with FMDV of one serotype does not confer protection against FMDV of a different serotype. In contrast, the subtype classification of FMDV was based on serological assays such as cross-neutralization or complement fixation tests, usually using sera raised in guinea pigs. These assays allowed classification of FMDV in more than 65 serological subtypes. Subtyping was stopped when it was realized that using increasingly discriminatory assays such as reactivity with MAbs, virtually any new isolate could define a new subtype [ (Mateu et al., 1988) , see Domingo et al., 1990; Sobrino and Domingo, 2004 for review of serotype and subtype classification of FMDV]. Despite these considerations, it is unlikely that serological assays using in vitro tests would be responsible for a 100-fold difference between two human pathogens such as HRV and HAV.

Genotype differentiation is actually being witnessed during the expansion of HCV pandemics, partly due to a true genetic diversification of the virus as it circulated over the last decades, and partly due to increasing capacity of virus surveillance, and of molecular and phylogenetic tools for genome analysis.

It is the preferred model of molecular virologists. The initial concept was proposed by M.G. Rossmann, in his canyon hypothesis (Rossmann, 1989) , based on studies with HRV14. A canyon in the virus preserves the receptor-binding site inside the canyon, while permitting amino acid substitutions that affect antigenicity, without consequences for receptor recognition. A physical and functional separation between receptor and antibody binding allows extensive antigenic variation. Clearly, in many viruses there is an overlap between antigenic and receptor recognition sites (Section 4.5 in Chapter 4), that could limit antigenic variation. A difference in constraints is also supported by a structural comparison carried out by J.M. Casasnovas and his colleagues of the interaction of PV and HRV16 with their respective cellular receptors, that revealed a receptor-binding site more accessible in PV than in HVR16 (Xing et al., 2000) . This would render HRV the picornavirus most prone to antigenic variation, as indeed found in nature. Thus, constraints imposed by the requirement to interact with the cellular receptor may explain limited capacity for antigenic diversification, and perhaps with the contribution of other possible influences, the puzzle of widely different antigenic types despite similar high genome mutability. Additional structural and functional studies with viruses of different families are necessary to substantiate this proposal.",

            "text": "If some viruses have a limitation in accepting amino acid substitutions at their antigenic sites, they are expected to yield low frequencies of MAb-escape mutants [monoclonal antibody-resistant mutant (MARM) frequencies] in laboratory experiments. Comparison of MARM frequencies of different viruses shows that this is not the case (Table 7 .2). In particular, the cardiovirus Mengo virus (one serotype) displays similar MAR frequencies than HRV (hundred serotypes). In fact, none of the RNA and DNA viruses listed in Table 7 .2 deviate from a broad range of MARM frequencies of 10 \u22123 to 10 \u22125 , except for substitutions at some discontinuous epitopes of FMDV (Lea et al., 1994) . In several of the studies listed, the stability of the selected escape mutants was tested after a few passages in cell culture, but in other studies, lack of reversion of the antigenic change was not ascertained. Two FMDV escape mutants showed a selective disadvantage over the parental wild-type virus (fitness decrease); upon continued replication, the mutants acquired fitness-enhancing mutations without reversion of the antigenic change (Mart\u00ednez et al., 1991a) . Unless the escape mutations are selectively neutral, the expectation is that MARM frequencies may be an underestimate of the real rate at which the amino acid substitutions occur. Thus, it is possible that following selection by an antibody, some mutants may decrease in frequency due to a fitness cost, or that their level is maintained due to additional compensatory mutations acquired by the replicating genomes (Figure 7 .6). Viruses that are highly constrained for antigenic variation may be diagnosed through fitness decrease of MARM mutants despite them occurring at similar rates as those that affect unconstrained sites. This is a concept similar to the distinction between fitness and function that we made in Section 5.8 of Chapter 5. That is, the occurrence of an antigenic change does not guarantee that the change will be perpetuated in nature and contribute to natural antigenic diversification. Again, fitness should be considered as a relevant parameter, and fitness effects on antigenic stability have been largely unexplored. ",

The way to put order into such diversity is to classify viruses as done periodically by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (http://www.ictvonline.org/). The computational procedures developed to study phylogenetic relationships in evolutionary biology are routinely applied to virology to establish relationships among closely or distantly related viruses (Page and Holmes, 1998; Hall, 2001; Felsenstein, 2004; Salemi and Vandamme, 2004; Yang, 2006) . No phylogenetic tree that connects the viruses that have been characterized to date can be derived in a reliable way, not even a tree for DNA or for RNA viruses. What we can do is to produce trees for related viruses that probably share a common ancestor. Many data banks are available for viruses to retrieve sequences for comparison with new isolates. Despite the fact that data banks are periodically updated, some are listed in Table 7 .3, and can serve as the starting point to reach the desired uniform Stability of selected mutant subpopulations when selective pressure is removed. This scheme is the same portrayed in Figure 6 .3 of Chapter 3, but shifted toward the right of the time scale. Five different colors have been chosen to depict fluctuations of four genomic classes. In a real population, thousands of genomes may be involved in each infected cell. In the present diagram, the red line represents genomes selected for their resistance to neutralizing monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Once the antibody pressure is removed, the mutant genomes may remain dominant either because the relevant substitutions do not affect viral fitness or because compensatory mutations have been acquired (top diagram). In contrast, upon removal of the antibody pressure, the proportion of selected genomes may fade with time due to a fitness cost and absence of compensatory mutations (bottom diagram). In the latter case, the antibody-resistant mutant will not contribute to the long-term antigenic diversification of the virus. resource locator (URL) to implement a procedure for genome characterization. Prior to any comparative study of nucleotide or amino acid sequences (not only to establish phylogenetic relationships, but also to calculate genetic distances, to identify regulatory regions, functional domains, and structural motifs, to design oligonucleotide primers for amplifications, or other applications) it is essential to align sequences accurately, and some programs for sequence alignments are also given in Table 7 .3.",

Some of them offer a link with the web page of the ICTV thus providing background information to assign newly determined sequences to current taxonomic groups. A structure-based amino acid sequence alignment of protein homologues can be carried out based on three-dimensional structures of proteins. Such types of amino acid sequence alignments may help in the identification of relevant structural and functional motifs. Sequence variability among a set of aligned sequences can be quantitated by the number of variable sites, mean pairwise diversity, mutation frequency, and other estimators (i.e., the Watterson's estimator) (Page and Holmes, 1998; Mount, 2004; Salemi and Vandamme, 2004 ) (see also Chapter 3 for parameters used to quantify mutant spectrum complexity). Relevant information on protein evolution can be derived from alignment of the protein sequence of related viruses (or of isolates from one virus, or for components of the same mutant spectrum) and analyzing the statistical acceptability of the divergent amino acids at each position. Statistical acceptability derives in part from the chemical nature and shape of the amino acid side chains and from the limitations that the genetic code imposes on amino acid replacements (Porto et al., 2005) . The basic assumption is that the more conserved the amino acid sequences, and the more similar are the variant amino acids, the more likely is that the proteins derived from a common ancestor. M. Dayhoff pioneered the early comparison of protein sequences establishing a protein information resource (PIR) in the middle of the twentieth century. Tables named PAM (percent accepted mutation) were constructed and several evolved versions such as BLOSUM matrices, based on the BLOCKS database, are used to compare protein sequences. The BLOSUM62 amino acid substitution matrix groups amino acids according to their chemical structure and provides a probability of occurrence of each amino acid replacement: zero, amino acid replacement expected by chance; positive number, replacement found more often than by chance; and negative number, replacement found less often than by chance.",

Application of phylogenetic methods to virus evolution requires careful consideration of the evolutionary models to be used, including probabilities of the different types of nucleotide and amino acid replacements, and the rates at which they may occur. Statistical methods (i.e., likelihood ratio tests) are available to select an adequate models for a given data set (Salemi and Vandamme, 2004 ). At the nucleotide sequence level, it is often assumed that when transitions are more frequent than transversions in a set of related sequences, no saturation of mutation took place. In contrast, when transversions are more frequent than transitions, saturation is presumed 7.6 PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS AMONG VIRUSES (Xia and Xie, 2001) . Parameter \u03b1 applied to amino acid sequence alignments (e.g. using program AAml from PAML package, version 3.14) takes into account multiple amino acid replacements per site, as well as unequal substitution rates among sites (Yang et al., 2000) . Parameter \u03b1 can be calculated using the amino acid replacement matrix WAG available in the program MODELTEST (Posada and Crandall, 1998) . Despite their obvious utility, it is unlikely that these statistical procedures which were developed on the assumption of successions of defined sequences (rather than mutant clouds) can capture the complexities underlying long-term evolution of viruses in nature. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on nucleotide (and deduced amino acid) sequence alignments are generally possible with selected genes of relatively close viruses (i.e., that belong to the same family). The main methods used to derive evolutionary trees are: maximum parsimony, distance, ML, Bayesian methods of phylogenetic inference, and splits-tree analysis [reviewed in (Eigen, 1992; Page and Holmes, 1998; Mount, 2004; Salemi and Vandamme, 2004; Sullivan, 2005; Holmes, 2008) ] (Table 7 .3).",

            "text": "Distantly related viruses, with no discernible nucleotide or amino acid sequence identity, can sometimes be grouped on the basis of the three-dimensional structures of viral proteins. The evolutionary trace (ET) clustering method combines phylogenetic partition of sequences with structural information (Chakravarty et al., 2005) , and it may help identifying functionally relevant domains shared by divergent isolates in particular highly variable capsid and surface viral proteins. ET can be applied to proteins and nucleic acids, and its clustering features may reveal conserved structures that are overlooked when all sequences are compared together. As explained in Chapter 1, the great diversity of amino acid sequences recorded among viral structural proteins (several URL links in Table 7 .3) are actually reduced to a limited number of morphotypes at the structural level. In another approach, the probabilities of equivalence between pairs of residues in viral proteins are converted into evolutionary distances (Bamford et al., 2005; Ravantti et al., 2013) . The structure-based classification has grouped the coat protein of icosahedral viruses in separate classes, each of which, interestingly, embraces different domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya). A lineage of structurally related viruses includes tailed bacteriophages and the herpesviruses, suggesting that parts of the genomes of complex viruses may have a very ancient origin. They might have belonged to viruses that infected primitive cells, before the latter diverged into the domains of life that we identify in our biosphere (Bamford et al., 2005; Villarreal, 2005) (compare with models of virus origins in Chapter 1). Viral clades may cluster with clades of their host species, suggesting either virus-host coadaptation or an extended parasite-host relationship, with limited possibilities of jumping the host barrier (Section 7.7). Hantaviruses and their rodent hosts (Plyusnin and Morzunov, 2001) , lyssaviruses and bat species, spumaviruses and their primate hosts, and herpesviruses and their vertebrate hosts, are some among other examples of long-term host-virus coevolution (Mc Geoch and Davison, 1999; Woolhouse et al., 2002; Switzer et al., 2005) . (See, however, a discussion on time scale discrepancies of coevolutionary rates (Sharp and Simmonds, 2011) , and compare with section 7.3.3)",

It will depend on whether viral vectors or infected individuals carry the virus over long distances or not. A defined phylogenetic group may include viruses that produce similar or different pathology. This is because the capacity of a virus to cause disease may depend on modest genetic change (i.e., one or a few amino acid substitutions) that does not alter its position in a phylogenetic tree. It is important to emphasize that, independently of the time frame considered, the tips of phylogenetic trees are a cloud of mutants, that genomes within the cloud are the origin of future diversification pathways, and that individual cloud components may differ in pathogenic potential. Figure 7 .7 summarizes the diversification of HIV-1 since it entered the human population. Once HIV-1 originated from multiple introductions of a chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz), the four major HIV-1 groups M, O, N, and P were generated, and group M evolved into the multiple subtypes and recombinant forms that circulate at present. Many factors determine the pathogenic potential of any of the HIV-1 subtypes and the newly arising recombinant forms. The relevance of the mutant cloud in determining viral fitness and survival was documented by comparing five isolates of west Nile virus (WNV) that had identical consensus sequences and differed in the mutant spectrum, as analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) (Kortenhoeven et al., 2015) (Figure 7 .8). The study concerned a WNV lineage 2 that circulated in Europe during the beginning of the twenty-first century. Environmental changes modified the haplotype composition while maintaining an invariant consensus sequences, an example of \"perturbation\" manifested only at the level of the mutant spectrum (see Section 6 in Chapter 6).",

However, despite limited records, there is also evidence that some viruses that once produced human disease might be now extinct. One example is Economo's disease (also termed lethargic encephalitis or epidemic encephalitis), a degenerative disease of the brain that produced loss of neurons. The disease had an acute phase of variable duration and intensity, followed by a chronic phase, sometimes with a late onset of symptoms. The disease showed a seasonal character with maximum incidence in late winter. The first cases were recorded in Eastern Europe in 1915 and the disease was first described by Baron C. Von Economo in Vienna in 1917 . In 1920 -1923 the disease attained pandemic proportions, although the number of cases and mortality were limited. It was estimated that between 1917 and 1929 about one hundred thousand cases occurred in Germany and Great Britain and then, mysteriously, the number of cases decreased and the disease disappeared (Ford, 1937) .

Interestingly, in the 1980s the incidence of serotype C FMDV decreased to the point that at the beginning of the twenty-first century this FMDV serotypes was considered nearly extinct and its eradication feasible. It cannot be totally excluded, however, that type C FMDV is replicating in some persistently infected ruminant in some remote part of our planet and that the virus reemerges again. If not, its ecological niche has been occupied by FMDVs of other serotypes. This is one important issue behind virus eradication (smallpox in the late 1970s or rinderpest in 2011): the possibility that the niche left by an eradicated pathogen is occupied by a related pathogen. A.E. Gorbalenya, E. Wimmer, and colleagues examined the possible evolutionary origin of present-day PV, and that other picornaviruses might occupy the PV niche in the event of its eradication (Jiang et al., 2007) . Their phylogenetic analysis suggests that PV could originate from a C-cluster coxsackie A virus through amino acid substitutions in the capsid that led to a change of receptor specificity (other cases are discussed in Chapter 4). They generated chimeras of PV and its putative ancestors, and some of them were viable and pathogenic for transgenic mice expressing the PV receptor. The authors suggest that in a world without anti-PV neutralizing antibodies, coxsackieviruses may mutate to generate a new PV-like agent.",

Emergence is defined as the appearance of a new pathogen for a host, while reemergence often refers to the reappearance of a viral pathogen, following a period of absence. Being a popular topic, the reader will find numerous books and reviews on the subject. It is worth emphasizing that in the twentieth century many authors took the lead in emphasizing the problem of viral emergences, and the need to investigate the underlying mechanisms, notably S.S. Morse and J. Lederberg [see several chapters of Morse (1993 Morse ( , 1994 ]. Given the adaptive capacity of viruses, in particular the RNA viruses, the reader will certainly suspect that genetic variation of viruses must be one of the factors involved in viral emergences. Indeed, most of the high-impact new viral diseases recorded recently or historically are due to RNA viruses. A statement by J. Lederberg reflects our vulnerability in the face of the nearly unlimited potential of viruses to vary: \"Abundant sources of genetic variation exist for viruses to learn new tricks, not necessarily confined to what happens routinely or even frequently\" (Lederberg, 1993) . The situation is even more complex because genetic variation of viruses is only one of many ingredients that promote the introduction of new viral pathogens in the human population. A report issued by US Institute of Medicine in 2003 analyzed and documented 13 factors that individually or in combination participate in the emergence of microbial disease. They include a number of sociological, environmental, and ecological influences that act to promote the emergence and reemergence of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa (Smolinski et al., 2003 ) (Box 7.2).",

Such individuals are termed super-spreaders, and can contribute large amounts of variant viruses to the transmission lottery (Rocha et al., 1991; Paunio et al., 1998; Gavrilin et al., 2000; Khetsuriani et al., 2003; Small et al., 2006; Odoom et al., 2008) . Concerning the recipient hosts, the higher the number of potentially susceptible hosts that come into contact with an infected donor, the higher the probability of establishment of an emergent infection. It is likely that the advent of agricultural practices some 10,000 years ago, combined with increased contacts between humans and animals, inaugurated a time of new viral emergences. In the new scenario, viruses could shift from a persistent (low interhost transmission) mode into an acute (high interhost transmission) infection mode.",

As correctly emphasized by S.S. Morse, changes in viral traffic may allow viruses to come near potential new hosts that had never been encountered before. Several sociological and ecological factors that can impact directly or indirectly the accessibility to an infected donor play a role. A typical example that connects several of the points listed in Box 7.2 is provided by the increase of arbovirus vectors during a specially humid season Relevance of virus population size and mutant spectrum composition in the zoonotic transmission of a virus. Only a subset of the genomes that surface an infected pig may be able to establish an infection in humans. The scheme indicates that a single genome that reached a human was not adequate to establish infection (pathway A). When multiple genomes reached the human (pathways B and C), only those that included a subset that displayed a minimum fitness in humans were able to initiate an infection and expand in the new host (pathway B). For pathways A and B, events are as if the contact between donor and recipient host had not taken place (arrows with cross). See text for implications.",

Experts expect new influenza pandemics to arise somewhere in Asia from the avian reservoirs of IV, yet in 2009 the new influenza pandemic originated in Central America. Paradoxically, despite a general agreement that surveillance of human and zoonotic virus reservoirs should be intensified using new molecular tools (i.e., NGS to go beyond the consensus sequences), the reality is that what we have learnt are the reasons why emergences are unpredictable. The \"abundant sources of genetic variation\" that was emphasized by J. Lederberg (see Section 7.7.1) should be extended to refer to \"abundant sources of complexity in viral emergences.\" For the time being we have to be ready to react once the emergence has already occurred.",
