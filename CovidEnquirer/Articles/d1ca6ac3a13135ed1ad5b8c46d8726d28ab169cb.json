Second only to abdominal pain and cramps, fever was the second most common chief complaint for patients who came to EDs that year, and the most common chief complaint of patients younger than 15 years. The presence of fever prompts the question of whether antimicrobials should be administered empirically. The survey data also indicate that antimicrobials were the most prescribed drug category, second only to analgesics. 1 In EDs around the United States, 7% to 8% of visits involve the administration of at least 1 antimicrobial. 2 Antimicrobials are ordered in the ED every day. Sometimes the indication is straightforward and the choices are simple; at other times the decisions are more",

Frequently, the decision to initiate empiric treatment needs to be made before the definitive diagnosis is known. In such cases, an organized approach is helpful.

Ideally each patient enters the ED with a clear history, and classic physical examination findings and the results of diagnostic tests mark an obvious path.

It is important to investigate whether a history of intolerance is based on a true allergy or a less serious problem; for example, a patient might have experienced gastrointestinal distress after taking a macrolide in the past, and therefore refuses to take it despite not having a true hypersensitivity reaction to the antibiotic. 9 Patients with acute or chronic organ dysfunction might require antibiotic strategies that deviate from routine standard approaches. A particularly common example is renal dysfunction. Renal failure (whether acute or chronic) can affect elimination of antibiotics, which should be considered when establishing the appropriate dose and timing interval of antibiotics that are cleared by the kidneys.

Unless significant action is taken in altering the way antibiotics are stewarded by physicians, organisms that are resistant to the newest and strongest antibiotics will continue to emerge. In November 2012, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Pew Health Group published a study highlighting the absolute necessity of improving prescribing habits and educating patients. 11, 12 Many Americans understand the importance of antibiotic resistance and know that the full course of prescribed antibiotics should be taken, even if they do not always comply with such recommendations. Patients believe that organisms are becoming resistant to antibiotics in the community, but they have low suspicion that the organisms will affect them or a family member. 11 As physicians, our role in patient education and taking responsibility to not overprescribe antibiotics is of the utmost importance. Prescribing rates for antibiotics have fallen 17% nationwide since 1999, although some states have had more progress than others. 13 Emergency physicians frequently feel pressured by patients to prescribe antibiotics. The number of antibiotics and other antimicrobials being developed has fallen drastically over the past several decades. From 1983 to 1987, pharmaceutical companies introduced 16 new antimicrobial agents to the market. Since then there has been a steady decline in production; between 2003 and 2007, only 5 new antibiotics were introduced, and since 2007 only 1 new agent has been developed. 14 The Pew Health Group identified several challenges to antibiotic innovation. Scientifically, new classes of antibiotic with novel mechanisms of action are difficult to discover. Economically, antibiotics produce lower revenues than other pharmaceuticals. In addition, achieving approval for a new antibiotic from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become more challenging, because investigators find it difficult to amass a sufficient number of study subjects and regulatory measures are tighter, requiring that the new agent must show improved efficacy and decreased adverse reactions or toxicity. 13 The financial burden associated with resistant organisms is increasing. The CDC estimates that each year, resistant infections account for about $20 billion management costs and contribute to an estimated 8 million additional hospital days. 14,15 An increasing number of organisms have been identified as having resistant strains in North America and abroad. The most prevalent drug-resistant pathogens cited by the CDC are Acinetobacter, group B streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, MRSA, Neisseria meningitidis, Shigella, S pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Candida, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the organisms that cause anthrax, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, influenza, and malaria. 16 Therefore, in times of increasing resistance, the most efficacious antibiotic should be deployed, which will create the least amount of inducible resistance within the host and deliver the most precise targeting to the susceptible organism and the affected organ system.",

These facts, coupled with growing concern about bacterial resistance, have led the CDC to advise judicious use of antibiotics.

Increasing resistance over the previous decade emphasizes the importance of selecting antibiotics that are effective against b-lactamase-producing organisms.

Current guidelines suggest that routine blood cultures tend to not be helpful. Blood cultures are more likely to be helpful when patients are exhibiting signs of sepsis or are immunocompromised, and when resistant organisms are suspected. 38 Standard recommendations for empiric coverage in adult patients with mild or moderate disease call for administration of cefoxitin, ertapenem, moxifloxacin, tigecycline, or ticarcillin-clavulanic acid. When the illness is judged to be severe or when the patient's vulnerability is judged to be high (in someone at an advanced age or in an immunocompromised host), broader coverage is typically advisable. 38 Decisions regarding the treatment of nosocomial infections should be guided by culture data and local resistance patterns. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are typically needed. Treatment decisions must be adapted when uncommon sources are suspected; fungal infection (commonly Candida albicans) might require the addition of fluconazole, and resistant Staphylococcus species might require vancomycin or linezolid. 38 Diverticulitis is a relatively common abdominal infection that can be treated medically, and on an outpatient basis in selected cases. General recommendations suggest that uncomplicated cases (ie, patients with diverticulitis for the first time, those without bowel perforation or abscess formation, patients who can hydrate orally, and those who can achieve sufficient pain control) can be discharged with instructions to obtain outpatient treatment and follow-up.

Streptococci (most often group A b-hemolytic streptococci) and staphylococci are the most prevalent causes of soft-tissue infections in otherwise healthy individuals. The approach to distinguishing staphylococcal from streptococcal cellulitis is based on clinical findings. S aureus is often associated with furuncles, carbuncles, and abscesses. When cellulitis is not associated with a clear portal of entry and diffuse erythema is found, Streptococcus species are more likely. Blood cultures are not routinely useful. 47 Simple cellulitis should be treated empirically with a penicillinase-resistant penicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin. Penicillin-allergic patients should be treated with clindamycin or vancomycin when inpatient treatment is required. The prevalence of community-acquired MRSA is increasing across the United States. In settings where prevalence is high, the threshold to cover should be low. Clindamycin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and tetracyclines are effective for community-acquired MRSA. In inpatient settings, vancomycin remains the antimicrobial of choice although other options do show promise, including linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline. 48, 49 Necrotizing Infections Emergency physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for necrotizing infections. Features that should engender concern include pain out of proportion to appearance, skin necrosis, crepitus or gas detected on imaging, bullae, skin sloughing, marked edema or firmness of subcutaneous tissue extending beyond erythema, cutaneous anesthesia, rapid progression, and evidence of sepsis. 47 Necrotizing infections can develop in any patient, but those with vascular insufficiency are at heightened risk (eg, diabetics and patients with venous stasis, lymphedema, or peripheral vascular disease).
