            "text": "Background: Viral Infectious clone systems serve as robust platforms to study viral gene or replicative function by reverse genetics, formulate vaccines and adapt a wild type-virus to an animal host. Since the development of the first viral infectious clone system for the poliovirus, novel strategies of viral genome construction have allowed for the assembly of viral genomes across the identified viral families. However, the molecular profiles of some viruses make their genome more difficult to construct than others. Two factors that affect the difficulty of infectious clone construction are genome length and genome complexity. Results: This work examines the available strategies for overcoming the obstacles of assembling the long and complex RNA genomes of coronaviruses and reports one-step construction of an infectious clone system for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae. Conclusions: Future use of this methodology will shorten the time between emergence of a novel viral pathogen and construction of an infectious clone system. Completion of a viral infectious clone system facilitates further study of a virus's biology, improvement of diagnostic tests, vaccine production and the screening of antiviral compounds.",

MERS-CoV genetically clusters with the bat coronaviruses Neoromicia/PML, HKU4-1 and HKU5-1 which occupy lineage C of the betacoronaviridae, no other identified human coronavirus exists within this genus (Raj et al., 2014) . Epidemiological studies of MERS-CoV implicate camels as a possible zoonotic host (Memish et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2013) . Since its emergence, MERS-CoV has spread between 26 countries causing 1375 labora-tory confirmed cases and 587 deaths (ECDC, 2015; ProMED-mail, 2016) . No other coronavirus has so greatly impacted public health, or global economics since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013) . The unexpected introduction of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV into the human population combined with a lack of current antiviral therapies or vaccines to protect the public from coronavirus related disease, makes study of these and similar viruses important to public health. In order to improve the timeline between discovery of a novel coronavirus and completion of an infectious clone system, we undertook the rapid construction of the MERS-CoV cDNA genome EMC/2012 (JX869059.2) by homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae.",

Infectious clone systems for viruses with small unfragmented positive sense RNA genomes are less demanding to construct than those with large negative sense, positive sense or fragmented genomes (Ebihara et al., 2005; Yount et al., 2000; Stobart and Moore, 2014) .",

            "text": "Construction of infectious clone systems for viruses of the Coronaviridae has lagged in comparison to those of other viral families because qualities of the coronavirus genome restrict the use of traditional molecular cloning techniques (Stobart and Moore, 2014) . The prototypical coronavirus possesses a positive sense RNA genome from 27 to 32 kb in length. Multiple regions of sequence redundancy exist (Gorbalenya et al., 2006) , whichdecrease the availability of unique restriction sites. The MERS-CoV genome (JX869059.2) has only 12 unique restriction sites (Fig. 1a) ; their positions and the sizes of the corresponding DNA fragments preclude a simple cloning strategy. Highly cytotoxic regions have also been described within coronavirus genomes, which cause E. coli cloning strains to poorly tolerate plasmids carrying coronavirus genome cassettes (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2002; Yount et al., 2002) . Performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR), especially reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on coronavirus genomes proves troublesome, as the error rate of DNA polymerases increases in relation to copy number and amplicon size (Eckert and Kunkel, 1991) . In combination, these factors make the assembly of coronavirus genome's by traditional molecular cloning tedious and time consuming (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2014; Enjuanes, 2005) . Virologists have developed several alternative methods to overcome these obstacles; however, none of them allow for rapid construction and expression of a coronavirus infectious clone system. The attempted strategies include targeted RNA recombination, transfection of multiple or single plasmid vectors and vaccinia virus transduction. Almazan et al. conducted a concise summary of available strategies for coronavirus genome construction in their 2014 review. In summary, they concluded that several alternatives to conventional approaches have benefited the science of coronavirus genome construction over the last thirteen years. We hypothesize that construction of a coronavirus genome by homologous recombination within S. cerevisiae, will prove an additional efficient means to molecular cloning coronaviruses while preserving the strengths of the plasmid based method: long term stability and efficient expression ( Fig. 1c) (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2014) .",

Use of our method avoided some of the obstacles to coronavirus genome assembly reported by other authors. For instance, regions of the coronavirus genome that show cytotoxicity in E. coli had no observed affect on the growth of S. cerevisiae. The issue of restriction site scarcity was also avoided, because unique sites were not needed to complete construction of the system. The strategy of homologous recombination seems particularly attractive when combined with the availability of viral genome sequences on Genbank and the commercial synthesis of cDNA fragments. These three resources, allow for the rapid construction of a viral infectious clone system without possession of a viral isolate or great risk of introducing mutations into a viral genome during repeated RT-PCR and PCR amplification. Combining homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae with other modern molecular methods (i.e: Gibson Assembly \u00ae ) may further shorten the construction time of viral infectious clone systems (Gibson et al., 2010) . Interestingly two other methods of coronavirus genome assembly (Targeted RNA recombination, and use of a Vaccinia virus backbone) both involve a variation of the homologous recombination mechanism (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2014) . Homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae builds upon these technologies because it allows for single-step construction of the viral cDNA genome in a BAC vector. The BAC based design does not have the stability issues of a targeted RNA based system or require multiple steps for RNA expression like the vaccinia virus one (Enjuanes, 2005) .",
