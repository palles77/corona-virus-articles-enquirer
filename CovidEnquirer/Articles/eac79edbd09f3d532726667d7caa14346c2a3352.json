This report opens with a tribute to the late Chris McGuigan, a Past-President of ISAR, then continues with summaries of the principal invited lectures. Doug Richman (Elion Award) investigated HIV resistance, Bob Vince (Hol\u00fd Award) showed how carbocyclic nucleoside analogs led to abacavir and Jerome Deval (Prusoff Award) explained how his group chose to seek a nucleoside analog to treat RSV. ALS-8176 was active in a human RSV-challenge study and is being evaluated in children. The first keynote address, by Richard H. Scheuermann, reported on the remarkable progress made in viral genomics. The second keynote address, by Heinz Feldmann, gave an overview of Ebola virus disease. There were four mini-symposia, Structural Biology, Diagnostic Technologies, DNA viruses and Zika virus. Diagnostic assays are approaching an ideal aim, a compact instrument, simple to use with any type of sample, no sample preparation and a result within an hour. The diversity of HCMV is far greater than for other herpesviruses, typically, an individual having >20,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). During antiviral treatment, there is rapid CMV evolution which is presumed to be due to preferential selection of already present variants rather than by the creation of new variants. A selection of contributor presentations includes oral prodrugs for nucleoside triphosphate analogs, a new method for the synthesis of phosphoramidate prodrugs and the clinical evaluation of brincidofovir for treating transplant recipients with adenovirus infections.",

This year, the meeting opened with a heart-felt tribute by Andrea Brancale to his mentor and colleague, Chris McGuigan who died in March 2016. This meeting summary continues with reports of lectures by the recipients of ISAR's three major awards, held in memory of Gertrude (Trudy) Elion, Anton\u00edn (Tony) Hol\u00fd and William (Bill) Prusoff. These are followed by summaries of the two keynote addresses, the main presentations within the four mini-symposia on Structural Biology, Diagnostic Technologies, DNA viruses, Zika virus, and four contributor presentations.",

Any descriptions of favorable treatment outcomes should not be taken as a recommendation for clinical use. Generally, I have added my personal comments on the meeting within the conclusion. In a few instances, I have added my own comment within the main text, indicated either by the wording or by the use of square brackets. Although this meeting report covers only a few of the presentations, it aims to illustrate the great diversity of topics discussed at ICAR, bringing together knowledge and expertise from a wide spectrum of antiviral research.

The clinical milestones were quickly achieved, first into man -May 2010 and first efficacy in patients -Mar 2011. Unfortunately, the trials were stopped due to toxicity concerns. However, it did prove that the phosphoramidate prodrug approach was successful and it was adopted by others.

The 4 cohorts each had a loading dose (LD) of 800 mg intramuscular (im), then followed by a maintenance dose (MD) of CAB either 200 mg subcutaneous (sc) q 4 w 3 times, 200 mg im q 4 w 3 times, 400 mg im q 4 w 3 times or 800 mg im at 12 w, respectively. The target plasma concentration of CAB was 0.6 mg/ml. With the 12 w dosing interval, the CAB trough level was about 1 mg/ ml. The 200 mg sc and im dosing were similar, both less than the 400 mg im dosing (trough levels about 2 and 3 mg/ml, respectively).",

EFdA is a highly potent HIV RT inhibitor (PBMC, EC 50 \u00bc 0.2 nM). It is a nonobligate chain terminator but it prevents translocation of the RT. Following a single oral dose (50 mg/kg) to rhesus macaques, the peak plasma concentration of EFdA is just over 10 mM, reducing to about 10 nM at nearly 180 h (7 days). In rhesus PBMCs, EFdA is taken up and converted to the diphosphate (DP) and triphosphate (TP) rapidly, > 100 mM at the first time point. At 7 days, the DP and TP are above 10 mM. This suggests the potential for once-a-week oral dosing. In a Phase Ib study, a single 10 mg oral dose in HIVinfected patients resulted in a 1.6 log 10 decrease in viral load at day 7. The intracellular half-life (t 1/2 ) of EFdA-TP was 103 h. There was no evidence of resistance out to day 10 (1.8 log 10 decrease in viral load).

Although Howard Schaeffer had synthesised the compound and drafted this paper after his move to Burroughs Wellcome, he sent a letter to Bob suggesting that Bob should be an author as it had been his idea to synthesize these acyclonucleosides. This compound was shown to be a substrate for adenosine deaminase e so it was a biologically active molecule. It remained unknown if it could be recognised by a kinase to form the corresponding monophosphate (acycloadenosine-MP). With Howard's move to Burroughs Wellcome and Bob's move to Minnesota, this idea was shelved until acycloguanosine was later found active as an antiherpes agent at Burroughs Wellcome. Subsequently in 1978 (Schaffer et al., 1978) , the antiherpesvirus activity of acycloguanosine was published. [Over 3 decades later, acyclovir (ACV) and its oral prodrug, valacyclovir (VACV), are still in use. It is interesting to note that tenofovir, synthesised by Tony Hol\u00fd, is also an acyclonucleotide e it is included, as its prodrug, in some of the most used single-tablet regimens (STR) for the therapy of HIV infected patients.]",

As in cyclaradine, the oxygen was replaced with a carbon but a double bond was used to give a ring with a similar shape to the ribofuranose. Mei Hua synthesised the first carbovir compound. To improve oral bioavailability, various alkyl analogs of carbovir were synthesised (Fig. 13 ). All these compounds were very active as HIV RT inhibitors, each analog being converted intracellularly to carbovir-MP which was then further phosphorylated to the active carbovir-TP. On 5th December 1988, a patent was filed with Bob and Mei as the inventors. These carbovirs were licensed to GlaxoSmithKline(GSK). Cyclopropylcarbovir was synthesised by GSK which claimed that the cycloalkyl chains were not covered by the patent. However, as for all the other alkyl analogs of carbovir, cyclopropyl carbovir was converted to carbovir-MP and to the active form, carbovir-TP. Following a lawsuit, GSK had to pay University of Minnesota $600 million and royalties. Although the cyclopropyl group was not essential, GSK had done so much work with this compound that it was this carbovir analog that was developed to become abacavir. The royalties have enabled the university to start and fund the Center for Drug Design, with Bob as director. Jerome noted that there are very few small-molecule drugs approved for negative strand (\u00c0) RNA viruses, none of these being virus replication inhibitors. In 2010, there was just a single (\u00c0)RNA virus replication inhibitor in clinical trials, T-705 which is now known as favipiravir. It has been approved in Japan for treating serious influenza infections and is in Phase III trials in the USA. In 2016, favipiravir and VX-787 were in Phase III and Phase II trials, respectively, for influenza infections, and five other compounds in Phase I trials.

Past experiences with herpes viruses, (HSV-1 and -2, VZV), HIV, HBV and HCV have shown that nucleoside analogs have provided the drugs with good broad-spectrum activity against many strains of the virus and have shown a high genetic barrier, limiting the problems due to virus resistance.

About 12 h after the first detection of RSV or on the morning of day 6, whichever occurred first, subjects were randomised and received the first dose of ALS-8176 or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was the area under the curve (AUC) for viral load in nasal washes, as determined by a RT-PCR assay for RSV RNA. There appeared to be an advantage when a loading dose was used, the reductions in AUC for viral loads being 73.4%, 85.3% and 88.0% vs. placebo, respectively (Fig. 16) . A secondary end point was the clearance rate of RSV RNA (the slope of the viral load change). It was most rapid in the two regimens with a loading dose, with reductions even at the first post-dosing sample at 12 h. In contrast, the viral load in the placebo group peaked about 3.5 days after randomisation. Importantly, this peak in RSV viral load was associated with a peak of symptoms. In the three treated groups, the mean symptom score and the mucus weights remained at about baseline throughout the observation period.

As of 6th April 2016, a total of 31,460 complete genome sequences were known, of these, 28,308 were for influenza A, nearly 20,000 of these being sequenced by JCVI. With such a large data set, one is able to seek much more detail about how antigenic drift allows seasonal influenza to thwart pre-existing immunity. Many immune epitopes in the hemagglutinin protein (HA) have been defined experimentally. Some B-cell epitopes are formed from continuous amino acid sequences but others from discontinuous regions which come together in the folded HA. Three of the latter have been designated as Sa, Sb and Ca2. Is it possible that only a few of these B-cell epitopes are important for protective immunity? As a working hypothesis, sites, within which the epitopes of B cells and antibodies (Ab) overlap, may be the key targets of protective immunity. If a region of the HA protein is important for protective immunity, then non-synonymous substitutions will be selected (when a base change codes for a different amino acid). By comparing the rates of non-synonymous substitutions (e.g. CTA (Leu) \u00bc> CAA (Pro), dN) and synonymous substitutions (e.g. CTA (Leu) \u00bc> CTG (Leu), dS), it is possible to find amino acid positions which diversify more than expected (i.e. the ratio of dN/dS is large).",

One can start by learning the lessons from past experience with dengue viruses. There have been no inhibitors, specifically designed for dengue, which have been taken to clinical trials. However, existing compounds have been tried. For example, balapiravir, a known HCV polymerase inhibitor, was tested clinically but found to be inactive because the dengue-induced cytokine production inhibited conversion of the prodrug to the active form. An adenosine analog, NITD008 was shown to have activity against dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses in cell culture assays and in animal models, but was abandoned due to toxicity concerns. It was also active against Zika virus in both cell culture assays and in a mouse model. Naturally, safety concerns are paramount as the greatest medical need is to treat pregnant women.",

Virus replication occurs in wild-type (wt) mice but typically the infection does not cause disease. In contrast, AG129 mice, lacking alpha, beta and gamma IFN receptors, proved to be a good choice as a model for Zika virus infections. Following subcutaneous (sc) inoculation of AG129 mice with Zika virus, various parameters were evaluated: disease signs (including conjunctivitis, hunching, lethargy, excitability, hind-limb paralysis), body weight and measurable viremia. To test potential antiviral compounds, the mice were infected with Zika Malaysia virus (sc, 10 2 pfu) and observed for at least 4 weeks. Viremia peaked at day 5 and reduced to baseline by day 9. The compounds were administered twice daily (bid) for 8 days starting 4 h before infection. The study parameters were weight change, survival and viremia. Several known compounds have been tested, including NITD008 but the most active compound so far was BCX4430 (viral RNA polymerase inhibitor). Previously, BCX4430 had been shown to be active in cell culture assays against a wide range of RNA viruses including filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) and flaviviruses (e.g. yellow fever). BCX4430 was tested at two doses, 300 and 150 mg/kg. The higher dose gave good protection (90% survival) whereas the lower dose only delayed death (0% survival). On day 13, for both treated groups, there was little change in weight from baseline whereas the placebo group had lost weight. In this experiment, there were also uninfected untreated mice which gained weight throughout the 19-day period. In contrast, the mice, treated with BCX4430 (300 mg/kg), remained at their baseline weight. There was a dose-response reduction in viremia. The surviving mice (treated with the higher dose of BCX4430) were rechallenged but no more disease or mortality was observed.",

Recently, technological developments in assay platforms that perform multiplexed PCR reactions has broken this negative cycle. Much recent progress has been made. Having used one of the platforms in his diagnostic laboratory for 16 months (Fig. 20) , Mark commented that he had no idea that there were so many cases of adenovirus infections in the pediatric population in the hospital.

Its oral lipid-conjugate prodrug, brincidofovir (BCV, CMX001), appears to have a better safety profile but data in immunocompromised patients are limited. In patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the incidence of HAdV viremia reportedly ranges from 3 to 15% in adults and from 6 to >40% in children. According to the current ECIL (European Conference on Infections in Leukemia) recommendations preemptive therapy should be started at first detection of HAdV in blood. However, in the presenter's experience, favorable outcome is most dependent on early onset of therapy and current data suggest that treatment decisions should be based on the monitoring of stool specimens to prevent invasive infection. The source of HAdV complications post-transplant may be de novo infection but much more commonly reactivation of the virus persisting in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. HAdV replication in epithelial cells of the GItract can be conveniently measured by using stool samples. The risk of viremia is negligible in the presence of HAdV loads 1 \u00c2 10 6 copies/g, but increases to >70% above this critical threshold level (p < 0.001).

It is also possible to study the effect of host factors, in particular, the potential of estrogen to act as a co-factor. Without an inserted estrogen pellet, no cancer was detected. It was discovered that estrogen contributed to the progression of cervical cancer. Furthermore, if the estrogen pellet is removed, the cancer regresses. Although the role of estrogen in human cervical cancer remains to be demonstrated, the known risk factors (HPV \u00fe oral contraceptives, HPV \u00fe many pregnancies, HPV \u00fe hormone replacement therapy (HRT)) all point towards estrogen being a factor.",

Although in normal mice, no warts are detected, is it possible that UVB radiation may have an impact? If UVB radiation is given either 24 h before of 24 h after infection, immunocompetent mice become susceptible to virus-induced warts. By giving the UVB radiation with or without shielding of the head and ears, it was shown that UVB acts systemically. It is known that UVB can induce systemic immunosuppression and this seems to correlate with the onset of MnuPV1-induced disease.

Both viruses are transmitted via saliva, modulate the immune system, persist for life with widely dispersed latent reservoirs from which they reactivate periodically. The HHV-6 (A or B) genomes contain telomeric repeats (TAACCC)n which are involved in recombinational integration of the complete viral genome into the telomeres of human chromosomes. Such integration has been hypothesized to be a mechanism of HHV-6 latency. Importantly, germ line integration of HHV-6 genomes enables Mendelian inheritance of the virus (inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6, iciHHV-6). Following germ line transmission, essentially every cell throughout the body contains at least one virus genome. The iciHHV-6 prevalence is~1% in the USA and the UK, but~0.2% in Japan. Vertical transmission via iciHHV-6 should not be confused with the horizontal transmission that occurs in >90% of the population. In whole blood of individuals with iciHHV-6, viral loads are typically~10 6 copies/ml, but most, if not all, of the genomes detected are from cells that harbored quiescent integrated virus genomes. Thus far, iciHHV-6 has been associated with angina pectoris in large population-based studies, and with bacterial infections in solid organ transplant recipients.

In immunocompromised patients, for example, after solid organ transplant (SOT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), HHV-7 reactivation is common but causes little disease.",

The path towards discovery of HIV therapies, which combine good safety with the ability to prevent the emergence of HIV resistance, is an amazing success story. Even now, starting a new chapter, cabotegravir and EFdA both have the potential not only to be used for therapy but also to prevent transmission. Atripla showed the way how two companies can work together to create a new, simple and effective single-tablet regimen. Likewise, if EFdA and cabotegravir were to be combined into one long-acting injection (e.g. once every three months), it would have the potential to limit HIV transmission even in the poorer countries of the world. These two compounds have complementary activities, first to reduce HIV DNA production, then to inhibit its incorporation into host DNA. We know that preventing transmission is an achievable aim. When trial subjects took Truvada (FTC/TDF) once daily prior to exposure (PrEP), transmission was essentially prevented, there being no seroconversions in subjects taking the drug daily. However, this trial also proved that once daily dosing was not an acceptable regimen for most of the trial participants. If women can have an injection of EFdA/cabotegravir with their monthly contraceptive injection, preventing HIV transmission may become a practical reality.",

Although none of these trials proved that the active treatment reduced mortality, the various trends in mortality, viral loads and symptoms all pointed towards a benefit sufficient to warrant further evaluation. The two favipiravir trials used historical controls e the reports justified this decision as a pragmatic response to serious concerns raised by the local health care teams. The ZMapp trial was a randomised trial, although not blinded. It was not stated in the report, but I wonder if the number of available courses of ZMapp was so limited, there would not have been enough available ZMapp to treat all the expected patients, thus making a randomised trial more acceptable. However, in the ZMapp trial for patients recruited in Guinea, the standard of care included favipiravir, following the decision of the Ministry of Health. Surely, this points the way to a possible clinical trial design during a future Ebola outbreak -all arms of the trial should have potentially active treatments, for example, favipiravir, GS-5734, BCX4430 or ZMapp. Any highly active treatment would soon become apparent.

My report ends with brincidofovir which had good efficacy against adenovirus in hard-to-treat immunocompromised patients.",
