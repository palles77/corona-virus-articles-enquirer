            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first appeared in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. Although virus isolation and serology were useful early in the SARS outbreak for diagnosing new cases, these tests are not generally useful because virus culture requires a BSL-3 laboratory and seroconversion is often delayed until 2 to 3 weeks after infection. The first qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-coronavirus (CoV) were sensitive and capable of detecting 1 to 10 genome equivalents. These assays were quickly supplemented with quantitative real-time assays that helped elucidate the natural history of SARS, particularly the initial presence of low viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract. The unique natural history of SARS-CoV infection dictates the testing of both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, the testing of multiple specimens from the same patient, and sending out positives to be confirmed by a reference laboratory. Commercially available reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS have recently appeared; however, meaningful evaluations of these assays have not yet been performed and their true performance has not been determined. These CoVs have been identified in a wide range of animals including mice, rats, chickens, turkeys, swine, dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, cattle, and humans, causing a variety of severe diseases including gastroenteritis and respiratory tract diseases. Until 2002, there were only two CoVs know to infect man namely CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E. CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E were identified in the mid-1960s as a cause of mild self-limiting upper respiratory infection and were subsequently shown to cause approximately one third of common cold-like illnesses in adults. Overall, they account for between 5 and 30% of respiratory tract infections, and outbreaks may occur at 3-to 4-year intervals. 1 Based on genotypic and serological characterization, CoVs have been divided into three distinct groups, with CoV-229E in group 1 and CoV-OC43 in group 2. 2 Since 2002, three additional CoVs have been discovered, bringing the total number of CoVs infecting man to five. SARS emerged from China in the fall of 2002, and SARS-CoV was identified as the causative agent. 3 On the basis of genome analysis, SARS-CoV was originally assigned to a fourth CoV group but more recently has been recognized as distantly related to the group 2 CoV and has been considered as a group 2 subgroup. 4 In 2004, a novel group 1 CoV associated with respiratory tract infections, CoV-NL63, was discovered in The Netherlands and its genome sequenced. 5 In 2005, a fifth human CoV, a group 2 CoV, was discovered in patients with pneumonia in Hong Kong. 6 All CoVs belong to the genus Coronavirus within the family Coronaviridae and are enveloped viruses that possess a positive-strand RNA genome of 27 to 32 kb in size, representing the largest known genome among all RNA viruses. The genomic RNA is capped and polyadenylated and comprises several genes encoding both structural and nonstructural proteins. The genome organization of CoV has the characteristic order 5\u0408-replicase, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N)-3\u0408. 2 The GC content ranges from a low of 32% for CoV-HKU1 to a high of 41% for SARS-CoV. In addition to the S, E, M, and N structural proteins, the genome also encodes a chymotrypsin-like protease, replicase (polymerase), helicase, and hemagglutinin-esterase. For the replicase gene a frame shift interrupts the protein coding regions and separates open reading frames 1a and 1b. Both the 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 ends contain short untranslated regions. The RNA genome is translated as a polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved by the chymotrypsin-like protease. The S gene encodes the spike glycoprotein, which binds to the host cell receptor [ACE-2 in the case of SARS-CoV and aminopeptidase N (CD13) for human HCoV-229E] and leads to membrane fusion and viral entry.",

            "text": "Epidemiology SARS-CoV is believed to be zoonotic in origin, having crossed into humans most likely from an unidentified animal host in the wild game markets in Guangdong, China. Many of the first infected individuals in November and December of 2002 had contact with the live-game trade. The disease was first called \"infectious atypical pneumonia\" because it caused clusters of disease in families and health care workers. The etiological agent of SARS was identified as a new CoV by Peiris and coworkers 3 at the University of Hong Kong, and the viral genome was fully sequenced, in a record time of 3 weeks, by researchers at the University of British Columbia Center for Disease Control in Canada. 4 Genomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV was a new CoV not previously found in humans. The absence of antibody in healthy humans suggested that SARS-CoV had recently emerged in the human population and that animal to human interspecies transmission seemed the most probable explanation for its emergence. Specimens collected from apparently healthy animals in the wild-game animal markets in China indicated that a number of animals, including the Himalayan palm civet cat and raccoon dogs, yielded a SARS-CoV-like virus with more than 99% nucleotide homology to human SARS-CoV. 7 Many animal handlers with no previous history of a SARS-like illness were later found to have serum antibodies to SARS-CoV. Taken together with the fact that a number of SARS cases had an epidemiological link to wild-game animals, SARS-CoV was most probably introduced into humans from wild animals sold in wet markets in Guangdong, China.",

            "text": "At the beginning of the SARS outbreak, nosocomial infections played an important role in the outbreak. The first major outbreak in Hong Kong occurred in the Prince of Wales Hospital approximately March 10, 2003 , and resulted in 138 SARS cases, 69% of which were hospital workers. By the end of the outbreak, there were 1755 SARS cases in Hong Kong, 339 of which involved workers in 16 hospitals. In Canada, the first large outbreak also occurred in a community hospital, affecting 128 patients, 37% of which were hospital staff. The major sources of transmission in humans are droplets, aerosolization, and fomites. Deposition of droplets onto the respiratory epithelium probably initiates infection. Whether infection can occur through the oral or conjunctival epithelium remains unknown, but SARS-CoV has been detected in tears. Asymptomatic infection of humans appears to be a rare event. Despite the rapid spread of SARS worldwide, household transmission of SARS is relatively inefficient, 8 and the average number of secondary infections caused by any one case is low (2.2 to 3.7) compared with influenza (5 to 25). Superspreading events in which a few infected individuals disproportionately contribute to transmission (ie, a difficult intubation in the intensive care unit resulting in infection of a number of house staff) were characteristic of the outbreak. Factors associated with superspreading events are not well understood but may include co-infection with other viruses, host factors such as immunosuppression, and/or environmental factors. The number of infected staff in hospitals was strongly correlated with the number of admitted SARS patients, the length and type of exposure, and the use of personal protective equipment such as gloves and masks. Later in the outbreak it was shown that personal protective equipment significantly decreased nosocomial infections and played a significant role in outbreak management. 9",

A few days of cough and low-grade fever progress rapidly to full-blown pneumonia requiring hospitalization, often including mechanical ventilation. Fever, malaise, lymphopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, together with infiltrates and consolidation on chest X-ray, are typically present. 10 Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies have shown that the viral load is high in the lower respiratory tract but low in the upper respiratory tract. Viral load in the upper respiratory tract and feces is low during the first 4 days and peaks at approximately day 10 of illness. 10 This is in marked contrast to other respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, that peak soon after the onset of symptoms. This unusual feature of SARS-CoV infection explains its low transmissibility early in the illness and perhaps explains why outbreaks in some countries were limited to only a few cases. More importantly, it explains the poor sensitivity of early reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR tests on nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens collected early in the illness.",

Approximately a quarter of SARS patients had watery diarrhea, and virus can be cultured from the feces and urine as well as the respiratory tract. 10 Virus can also be detected by RT-PCR in serum, plasma, and peripheral blood leukocytes; however, the viremia might be short lived. Patients also have a pronounced peripheral T-cell lymphocytopenia with reduced CD4 and CD8 cell counts and with a third of individuals having a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm 3 . Infected individuals with high serum viral loads have a poor prognosis. Between days 10 to 15 of illness, high viral loads in NP aspirates, feces, and serum are independent predictors of adverse clinical outcome. SARS-CoV is invariably found in the lungs of individuals dying of SARS, but viral load is usually higher in those dying earlier in the course of illness (\u03fd21 days). Approximately one quarter of patients with SARS require management in intensive care units and the overall case fatality rate is \u03f311%. Disease severity and mortality correlates with age, the highest mortality rates (52%) occurring in those \u03fe65 years of age, and the lowest rate in the 0-to 24-year-old group.

The natural history of a viral infection indicates the most appropriate clinical specimens for diagnosis, ie, where the virus will be secreted and detected and when in the course of disease different specimen types would be expected to be positive for virus, and SARS-CoV is no exception. The evolution of diagnostics for SARS has been different from that of most viruses. The need for a BSL-3 facility for virus isolation and difficulty in culturing the virus from infected individuals late in the outbreak (possibly as a result of genetic drift of the virus) precluded the use of culture for diagnosis in most outbreak settings. Furthermore, the late seroconversion, 2 to 4 weeks after infection for most patients, all but eliminates a serological diagnosis for detecting recent infections. The first serological tests used SARS-CoV-infected cells on microscope slides and immunofluorescent staining or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests of crude cell lysates containing SARS-CoV antigens to detect serum antibodies. When used together with multiple specimens, virus isolation and serology proved useful for identifying patients at the beginning of the outbreak; however, they proved less satisfactory for diagnosing new cases in the first few days after onset of symptoms. Initial culturing of a CoV from patients in Hong Kong enabled the early identification of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy and led to the development of the first nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detecting SARS-CoV RNA. Identification of a CoV by electron microscopy led to the search for conserved regions of the CoV genome and the development of RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV RNA. Molecular diagnostic testing using NAAT quickly became the mainstay of SARS diagnosis.",

The first PCR primers were developed as a collaborative effort between 17 laboratories participating in the World Health Organization SARS Laboratory Consortium. These primers have been used for the development of both nested and nonnested, one-step or two-step (combined or separate reverse transcriptase reaction) conventional heat block RT-PCR, as well as real-time PCR assays (Table 1 ). Drosten and colleagues 12 used two sets of primers in a nested PCR format to amplify a 109-bp fragment. This assay had an analytical sensitivity of 10 genome equivalents (GE) per reaction. They also used the same primers in a real-time TaqMan assay and showed that the real-time assay had equivalent sensitivity to the nested assay in detecting SARS-CoV RNA in 18 clinical specimens. This study reported PCR results for only 49 specimens obtained from 3 patients in Frankfurt, Germany, and 18 patients in Hanoi, Vietnam. Ksiazek and colleagues 13 used different pol 1b gene primers and described a two-step assay with a sensitivity of 100 GE. Using specimens from six countries, they reported that RT-PCR was more sensitive than culture for diagnosing SARS. It is not clear, however, how many specimens were tested by both methods. Poutanen and colleagues 10 also described a two-step pol 1b assay for detecting SARS-CoV RNA in clinical specimens obtained from 10 patients in the Toronto SARS outbreak. These first three assays were used to test only a small number of clinical specimens and were not compared to any other NAATs, precluding an assessment of their performance. Lau and colleagues 14 described an enhanced RT (ERT)-PCR that involved target preamplification by using two separate amplifications of a region of the pol 1b gene. The first PCR was a conventional heat block assay followed by a TaqMan real-time amplification using product from the first reaction. The resulting product of the ERT-PCR was a 68-bp amplicon. The assay was used to test 120 specimens from 80 patients in Hong Kong and China. The enhanced assay detected 28 of 120 positives versus 21 of 120 positives for the TaqMan assay. 14 However, the analytical sensitivity of this assay was not provided, and additional testing of the discordant specimens was not performed to allow comparative assay performance.",

            "text": "The first RT-PCR assays for SARS were not evaluated for performance. At the time these assays were developed, little was known of the natural history of SARS, including when the virus was present in various body compartments. For this reason, care must be taken when reading early publications especially when the words sensitive or sensitivity are used. Early publications often used the word sensitive in the context of the rate of positivity; when articles said that PCR was only 40 to 60% sensitive for NP specimens in the first few days after infection, they really meant that the virus was present in only 40 to 60% of NP specimens. The assay may have had a clinical sensitivity higher than 60%, but the natural history of the infection dictated that the NP specimen would be positive at best only 60% of the time. Determining the performance (sensitivity and specificity) of a test involves comparing it to an appropriate gold standard or reference standard. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of any one RT-PCR assay, the test in question must be compared to the best possible reference standard that defines the true status of specimens. When one test is compared to another test, the discordant specimens (positive in one test and negative in another) should be examined by a third test that acts as an arbitrator to determine the true status of the specimen. In this way a true positive can be de-fined as being positive in two or more tests, and this can be used as the reference standard. 25 As new assays are developed, evaluation using three or more tests helps determine the performance of each individual test. Few of the NAATs described for SARS in Table 1 have been evaluated by comparison with other amplification tests. Only two reports in Table 1 involved comparison of three or more assays and only one study used a combined reference standard to determine sensitivity and specificity of specific tests. In the first report, Drosten and colleagues 17 tested 66 SARS specimens by three different tests including an in-house RT-PCR and two first generation commercial tests, RealART HPA coronavirus kit from Artus (Hamburg, Germany) and the SARS Coronavirus LightCycler kit from Roche (Branchburg, NJ). They indicated sensitivities of 70.8% for Artus and 67.1% for Roche, calculated by the number of positive samples divided by the number of samples tested. 17 They did not however indicate the results for each specimen in the three different tests or use a combined reference standard to calculate performance. In the second publication, Mahony and colleagues 15 tested 68 SARS specimens in seven different assays (six in-house and the Artus test) and used a combined standard of positivity in two or more tests to calculate performance. As shown in Table  2 , based on a small number of positive specimens, the sensitivities of the tests ranged from 83.3 to 100% while the specificities ranged from 94 to 100%. Of interest, the commercially available Artus test had a sensitivity of 94.4% (17 of 18) and a specificity of 100% (50 of 50). In Sixty specimens included 12 NP, 28 urine, and 20 fecal specimens. True positives were defined as positive in at least two assays (n \u03ed 18). Values in parentheses represent the number of specimens positive or negative for the specified assay/the total number of true positives (sensitivity) or true negatives (specificity).

NP specimens, which are often negative during the first week of infection, have the highest positivity rates in the second week of illness, peaking at approximately day 10. Quantitative PCR revealed that viral loads were highest in lower tract specimens (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum, endotracheal aspirates), and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens have been positive more frequently than NP specimens. 17, 27, 28 The collection of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, however, has been associated with increased risk of nosocomial transmission and risk to health care workers and was halted in many institutions. The low virus detection rate in NP specimens early in the course of infection underscores the importance of optimal timing and specimen type for diagnosis. The Centers for Disease Control has recommended that multiple specimen sources be tested by nasopharyngeal plus oropharyngeal and serum/plasma during the first week of illness and nasopharyngeal plus oropharyngeal and stool specimens after the first week of illness.

These include testing multiple or serial specimens, testing for transcripts as well as genomic RNA, and enhancing RNA extraction. Testing multiple aliquots of the same specimen, although not yet evaluated for SARS-CoV, has proven useful for detecting other microorganisms when present in low levels in clinical specimens. 31 Detection of nucleocapsid transcripts by RT-PCR should in theory enhance the sensitivity of PCR for diagnosis because subgenomic RNA transcripts contain nucleocapsid gene sequences following discontinuous transcription. This approach however, has not been the case as RT-PCR assays targeting the nuc gene have not been more sensitive than pol gene assays and subsequent studies have shown that most of the viral RNA in clinical specimens is genomic RNA. The availability of nuc RT-PCR assays however, did provide a confirmatory assay for positive specimens early in the epidemic and assisted with determining the specificity of early tests. 15 Another approach to improving sensitivity involves extraction of a larger volume of the clinical specimen and using more RNA in the RT-PCR assay. By extracting a larger portion of NP specimens (420 l versus 140 l), the investigators increased the sensitivity of RT-PCR from \u03f350 to 80% for specimens collected from days 1 to 3 after disease onset while retaining the specificity at 100%. 20 In this particular study, there was no increase in the prevalence of amplification inhibitors during RNA purification, but this should be controlled in future studies by using an amplification control in the PCR reaction to rule out false-negatives due to PCR inhibition.",

            "text": "Our laboratory policy as well as recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization for a positive test result include the following: for a positive RT-PCR result, repeat the test using a second aliquot of the original specimen, and if positive, confirm the result by sending the specimen to a reference laboratory; or test the positive specimen by a second RT-PCR test targeting a different part of the genome, and if positive, confirm by a reference laboratory (www.cdc. gov/ncidod/sars/guidance/f/pdf/app2.pdf). False-positive specimens can occur with poorly designed primers or, alternatively, with specimens collected from a low prevalence population (specificity decreases as prevalence of infection decreases) or if laboratory testing is performed improperly. A negative RT-PCR test on an NP specimen from a suspected SARS patient does not rule out SARS because SARS-CoV is present in low levels in the upper respiratory tract in the first week of infection. A negative result from an infected patient could be due to the presence of PCR inhibitors that co-purify with RNA, a poor quality specimen, or a specimen lacking virus. Because the level of viral RNA in the NP and stool rises in the second week of illness, a follow-up NP and/or fecal specimen should be collected and tested by PCR. Negative PCR results for specimens from the upper respiratory tract could trigger sampling from the lower respiratory tract where the titers of virus are higher, although collection of these invasive specimens are associated with an increased risk of medical staff infection. Detection of SARS-CoV in plasma or peripheral leukocytes should be considered because this approach provides sensitivities of \u03f380% during the first week of illness. The use of multiple, serial respiratory tract and fecal specimens will improve the sensitivity of PCR diagnostic testing especially when a larger volume of the sample is extracted and a larger proportion of the sample RNA is used for amplification. 20, 32 The first generation of commercially available PCR assays for SARS may have suboptimal sensitivity and should not be used alone without sending parallel specimens to an experienced reference laboratory for testing. Recognizing that the first human infections were caused by a zoonotic virus that adapted to its new human host and that mankind faces the continuing possibility for the introduction of new variants of animal SARS-associated viruses, greater vigilance will be required to make a diagnosis of infection if new animal CoVs are introduced into the human population. The use of RT-PCR assays using consensus primers and sequencing that can detect all known CoVs would be recommended in this scenario.",

Upwards of 20 different NAATs have been described for the detection of SARS-CoV RNA in clinical specimens, the majority being RT-PCR assays. These assays have been evaluated for the most part on small numbers of clinical specimens from infected patients, and their true performance characteristics are poorly defined. This is particularly the case for the first generation of commercially available assays. The unique natural history of SARS-CoV infection dictates the testing of both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, the testing of multiple specimens from the same patient and the sending out of positives to be confirmed by a reference laboratory before a positive diagnosis is declared.",

            "text": "and other issues related to diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection are discussed in this review. (J Mol Diagn 2005, 7:551-559) Before 2003 human coronaviruses (CoVs) were the interest of only a few select virologists, and CoVs were not even on the radar screen of most clinical virology laboratories. This changed dramatically in March of 2003 with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from China. SARS first appeared as a potentially fatal cause of pneumonia in Guangdong Province of China in November 2002. The first human case was identified on November 16, and within 6 months SARS had spread to 29 countries and had infected 8098 and killed 774 individuals (World Health Organization: Summary of probable SARS cases with onset of illness from 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003. http://www.who.int/cst/ sars/country/talbe20040421/en/). The last known case in North America was identified on June 22, 2003, in Toronto and globally on July 15, 2003, in Taiwan. Beyond public health the outbreak had a profound effect on economics worldwide with an estimated $100 billion lost from global economies. SARS has arguably been the most significant event in medical virology since the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the early 1980s.",
