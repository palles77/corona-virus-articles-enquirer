The open reading frame of BICP27 was fused with the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) gene to investigate its subcellular localization in live cells and BICP27 was able to direct monomeric, dimeric or trimeric EYFP exclusively to the nucleolus. By constructing a series of deletion mutants, the putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) were mapped to 81 RRAR 84 and 86 RPRRPRRRPRRR 97 respectively. Specific deletion of the putative NLS, NoLS or both abrogated nuclear localization, nucleolar localization or both respectively. Furthermore, NLS was able to direct trimeric EYFP predominantly to the nucleus but excluded from the nucleolus, whereas NoLS targeted trimeric EYFP primarily to the nucleus, and enriched in the nucleolus with faint staining in the cytoplasm. NLS + NoLS directed trimeric EYFP predominantly to the nucleolus with faint staining in the nucleus. Moreover, deletion of NLS + NoLS abolished the transactivating activity of BICP27 on gC promoter, whereas deletion of either NLS or NoLS did not. The study demonstrated that BICP27 is a nucleolar protein, adding BICP27 to the growing list of transactivators which localize to the nucleolus.",

            "text": "Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) is a typical alphaherpesvirus that causes significant economic losses to the cattle industry (Turin et al., 1999) . The viral genome is believed to encode at least 70 polypeptides, among of which 25-33 are structural components of the virion (Misra et al., 1981) . It also encodes regulatory proteins and enzymes involved in DNA metabolism (Schwyzer and Ackermann, 1996) . During the lytic cycle of BHV-1 infection, the viral proteins are expressed in a cascade of three temporally distinct and functionally interdependent phases termed immediate-early (IE), early and late phase (Wirth et al., 1989) . BHV-1 encodes three major IE proteins (BICP0, BICP4, and BICP22). They are the structural and functional homologues to infected cell protein ICP0, ICP4, and ICP22 from herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) (Fraefel et al., 1994; Schwyzer et al., 1993; Wirth et al., 1992) . The infected cell protein 27 (BICP27) is the fourth regulatory protein of BHV-1, and a structural homologue of HSV-1 ICP27 (Singh et al., 1996) . ICP27 is a multifunctional regulator of gene expression which assumes different roles during the course of infection (Sandri-Goldin, 2008) .",

Furthermore, there is only 32% similarity between ICP27 and BICP27 in amino acid sequence. Although ICP27 and BICP27 both have a zinc-finger-like domain (CCHC), BICP27 does not have an RGG motif. The transcriptional and translational expression profiles of ICP27 and BICP27 were significantly different, suggesting that their functions may be partially different (Chalifour et al., 1996) . The exact role of BICP27 in virus infection is still unclear, but it has several properties that make it of particular interest. Besides its transactivating activity on gC promoter region (Hamel and Simard, 2003) , it has been demonstrated that BICP27 may be involved in 3 processing of mRNA (Singh et al., 1996) , like its HSV-1 counterpart.",

The intracellular distribution of BICP27 protein has not been well characterized. As an important step toward understanding the detailed functions of BICP27 in vivo is to determine its precise subcellular localization, a study has been undertaken to characterize the exact subcellular localization of BICP27. Immunofluorescence and cell fractionation methods revealed that BICP27 was located predominantly in the nucleolus with a faint staining in the nucleus in BHV-1 infected cells and transient transfected cells. By sequence analysis and constructing mutants, the putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) of BICP27 were identified and confirmed by functional analysis.",

The deletion mutants of putative NLS, NoLS or NLS + NoLS of BICP27 were generated by ligating two PCR fragments with vector pEYFP-N1 (Clontech), in which one with EcoRI site in N-terminus and a blunt end in C-terminus, and another one with BamHI site in C-terminus and a blunt end in N-terminus. The BICP27 ORF and its NLS, NoLS or both deletion mutants were amplified from the respective EYFP fusion constructs by PCR into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to generate respective eukaryotic expression plasmids. The gC promoter sequence was inserted into the BglII and HindIII sites of pGL3 (Promega) to generate a luciferase reporter gene plasmid pGL-gCp-Luc. Each construct was confirmed by sequencing.

The ECFP-tagged ribosomal protein L23 (ECFP-L23) encoded by plasmid pECFP-L23, was used as a nucleolar marker. The ECFP-L23 has been demonstrated to localize to the nucleoli upon overexpression (Birbach et al., 2004; Gleizes et al., 2001) . Immediately after transfection with pECFP-L23, MDBK cells were infected with BHV-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The cells were fixed 16 h post-infection and analyzed by an immunofluorescence assay using antipeptide serum 50 (Singh et al., 1996) against BICP27. BICP27 staining exhibited predominant nucleolus localization with a faint staining in the nucleus (Fig. 1A ). Based on their size and numbers, these subnuclear structures appeared to be nucleoli (Fig. 1A) . To confirm this assumption we cotransfected virus infected cells with the pECFP-L23. Fluorescence microscopy showed clear co-localization of BICP27 and ECFP-L23 (Fig. 1A) . This also demonstrated that the dense, dark-staining, irregular shaped subcellular organelles in the nucleus are nucleoli (Fig. 1A , transmitted and ECFP-L23). Thus phase-contrast images were taken to indicate the nucleolus in the following experiments. To further confirm this observation, subcellular fractions were subjected to Western blotting analysis. Fig. 1B showed that BICP27 was enriched in the nucleolus-containing fraction. No fluorescence was observed when preimmune serum was used (Fig. 1C) .",

To avoid this problem, the fluorescence microscopy technique was applied using live cells expressing EYFP. To investigate whether BICP27 plays a role in transporting a heterogenous protein to the nucleolus, ORF of BICP27 was inserted into pEYFP-N1 to generate pBICP27-EYFP. BICP27 fusions with EYFP dimer (dEYFP) or trimer (tEYFP) were also constructed as shown in Fig. 2A . Western blotting analysis showed that BICP27-EYFP, BICP27-dEYFP and BICP27-tEYFP were expressed at the expected molecular sizes 78, 106 and 134 kDa respectively using antipeptide serum 50 against BICP27 (Singh et al., 1996) (Fig. 2B ) or polyclonal antibodies against EYFP (data not shown), indicating that they were fusions of BICP27 (50 kDa) and different copies of EYFP (28 kDa). The subcellular localization of BICP27-EYFP fusion protein in live cells was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Low level expression of BICP27-EYFP was observed in the nucleolus right after removing the transfection mixtures (about 3 h after transfection), and the localization of BICP27-EYFP does not change after 48 h transfection (data not shown). This also confirmed that the nucleolar localization was not an artifact of high expression levels. Fig. 2C showed micrographs of COS-7 cells 24 h after transfection with plasmids encoding BICP27 and EYFP fusion proteins.

Arrows indicate the nucleoli. Each image is representative of the vast majority of the cells observed. ilar patterns of localization. The fluorescence was predominantly restricted to the nucleolus by BICP27 (Fig. 2C) . On the contrary, the fluorescence was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm but not the nucleolar structures in cells transfected with plasmids encoding EYFP monomer (pEYFP-N1) or dimer (pdEYFP-N1) (Fig. 2C) . In cells transfected with plasmid ptEYFP-N1 encoding EYFP trimer, the fluorescence was localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5C, tEYFP) , due to the molecular size of EYFP trimer (84 kDa) which prevents passive trafficking between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Gorlich and Mattaj, 1996) . Western blotting analysis of subcellular fractions of BICP27-EYFP showed similar results to that of BICP27 in BHV-1 infected cells (data not shown). No fluorescence was observed in non-transfected cells (data not shown). In order to investigate whether the orientation of BICP27 affects its localization in cells, DNA construct was also made to express BICP27 fused to the C-terminus of EYFP (EYFP-BICP27) (Fig. 2C) . The expression of EYFP-BICP27 was confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). The fluorescence microscopy demonstrated identical subcellular distribution patterns of BICP27-EYFP and EYFP-BICP27, thus the following experiments were performed only for EYFP fusion to C-terminus of BICP27. The subcellular distribution of BICP27-EYFP was also probed with a BICP27 antibody. The result of indirect immunofluorescence was consistent with that of EYFP autofluorescence, indicating that BICP27-EYFP remained intact and localized to the nucleolus. Taken together, these results indicated that BICP27 was responsible for driving EYFP into the nucleolus.",

Since BICP27 fusions with EYFP monomer, dimer or trimer showed similar nucleolus localization patterns, the following experiments were performed with monomer EYFP fusion. To investigate the amino acid sequence of BICP27 that is responsible for nucleolar localization, plasmids were constructed to encoding BICP27 deletion mutants in frame with EYFP (Fig. 3A) . Subcellular localization of a series of deletion mutants encompassing amino acids 1-50, 1-85, 1-91, 1-100, 1-214, 101-400, 92-400, 86-400 and 81-400 fused with EYFP was investigated. The expressions of all these mutants were confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-EYFP antibody, which detected the proteins of the expected sizes (Fig. 3B) . COS-7 cells were transfected with these constructs and the subcellular localization of each mutant was viewed by fluorescence microscopy at 24 h post-transfection. aa1-50-EYFP showed similar distribution patterns as EYFP, with fluorescence in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, but not in the nucleolus (Fig. 3C ). aa1-85-EYFP and aa1-91-EYFP were demonstrated to be located in the nucleus, but completely excluded from the nucleolus (Fig. 3C) . The cellular distribution patterns of aa1-100-EYFP and aa1-214-EYFP were similar to wild type BICP27-EYFP fusion protein, with the fluorescence enriched to the nucleoli. aa101-400-EYFP was distributed exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C ). aa92-400-EYFP was found predominantly in the cytoplasm with faint staining in the nucleoli (Fig. 3C ). aa86-400-EYFP localized predominantly to the nucleolus with cytoplasmic staining and background staining in the nucleus (Fig. 3C) . However, aa81-400-EYFP was localized predominantly in the nucleolus with background staining in the nucleus. The pattern was identical to that of wild type BICP27 and BICP27-EYFP (Fig. 3C , comparing with Fig. 1A and Fig. 2C panel EYFP) . To confirm this observation, subcellular fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis as shown in Fig. 3D . Taken together, these results indicated that the putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuleolar localization signal (NoLS) of BICP27 were located in its Nterminus arginine-rich domain from amino acids 81 to 85 and 86 to 97 respectively.",

To identify the functional NLS and/or NoLS in BICP27, the specific deletion of NLS, NoLS or NLS/NoLS from BICP27 was made as shown in Fig. 4A . The expression of BICP27-EYFP-NLS-del, BICP27-EYFP-NoLS-del and BICP27-EYFP-NLS/NoLS-del was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4B) . The NLS, NoLS, NLS/NoLS deletions significantly attenuated protein accumulation in the nucleus, the nucleolus or both respectively. The subcellular localization pattern of BICP27-EYFP-NLS-del was almost identical to that of aa86-400-EYFP (Fig. 4C , comparing with Fig. 3B, panel 86-400) .

To confirm this observation, subcellular fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis as shown in Fig. 4D . Furthermore, mutation of arginine to alanine in the NLS, NoLS, or NLS/NoLS resulted in identical subcellular localization pattern to the respective deletion construct (data not shown). Therefore aa81-84 (RRAR) and aa86-97 (RPRRPRRRPRRR) were identified as the functional NLS and NoLS respectively in the context of wild type BICP27.",

Chemical fixation may lead to the artifact of the protein localization, so the EYFP was introduced in this study. EYFP was used as a marker to visualize the subcellular localization of BICP27 in live cells and to identify the NLS and NoLS. BICP27-EYFP fusion protein with a molecular mass of 78 kDa was not expected to passively diffuse into the nucleoplasm without an NLS/NoLS. A previous study has shown that BICP27 targeted mainly to the nucleus (Singh et al., 1996) , though the protein was obviously enriched in the nucleolus too. This is different from the results in this research (Fig. 1A) . This might be due to the different fixation reagent.

This suggested that NoLS does not display nuclear localization function in the context of wild type of BICP27. However, similar to previous reports, the NoLS motif is arginine-rich (Table 2 ). This suggested that NoLS plays nuclear localization function due to its arginine-rich residues only when there is no functional NLS present in the protein and translocates some of BICP27-NLS-del through NPC to the nucleus and targets to the nucleolus (Fig. 4 panel NLS-del and Fig. 5 panel NoLS-tEYFP) . This also suggested that NLS and NoLS function differently when expressed in the full-length protein. Furthermore, NoLS-tEYFP has stronger nuclear localization than BICP27-EYFP-NLS-del, this might be due to a potential NES in the C-terminus of BICP27.

Many viral and cellular proteins are expressed not only in the nucleoplasm but also in specific subnuclear compartments. Localization to the nucleolus has been proved to be part of the strategy for virus to control both host cell and virus subgenomic RNA translation. The coronavirus N protein which is located in the nucleolus disrupted host cell division (Hiscox et al., 2001) , and the HIV regulatory proteins Tat and Rev made use of nucleolus for trafficking of HIV-1 RNA (Michienzi et al., 2000; Siomi et al., 1990) . A number of transcription factors have also been found to be expressed in the nucleolus. Among these transcription factors, the tumor suppressor TBP (Jones et al., 1992) and Rb (Cavanaugh et al., 1995) , in addition to their roles in RNA polymerase II transcription, also regulate rRNA transcription. BICP27 may be involved in 3 processing of mRNA (Singh et al., 1996) , and it might act as a transcription factor, thus its nucleolar localization is expected. Viral proteins may serve pleiotropic roles in regulating viral and host functions. For Rev and Rex, the nucleolar localization is required for their functions in posttranscriptional regulation of viral mRNA (Dundr et al., 1995) . Us11, an RNA binding protein of HSV-1, is involved in regulating mRNA accumulation in the cytoplasm and can functionally substitute for Rev and Rex (Diaz et al., 1996) . The nucleolar localization of BICP27 may suggest a new function for this protein.",

Based on the analysis of BICP27 deletion mutants and EYFP fusion proteins, the arginine-rich domain is a necessary signal for nucleolar localization. The identified domain has a 12-basic-residue cluster which is longer than most NLSs but similar in length to the NoLS of viral proteins such as Rex, Tat, Rev and a number of other proteins ( Table 2 ). The alignment of identified NoLS reveals a hallmark of a long stretch of basic residues. It has been shown that Rev (Fankhauser et al., 1991) , Rex (Adachi et al., 1993) and Tat (Marasco et al., 1994) interact with B23, a nucleolar shuttling protein. The interaction domain for B23 was mapped to its highly acidic domain (Adachi et al., 1993; Szebeni et al., 1995) , whereas for Rev (Szekely et al., 1995) and Rex (Adachi et al., 1993) the interaction domains were mapped to their respective NoLSs. By analogy to Rev, Rex, Us11 and ICP27, BICP27 may be involved in the regulation of viral RNA processing or transport. To clearly define the role of BICP27's nucleolar localization in viral replication, it would be helpful if mutants that dissociate transcriptional function from nucleolar localization could be developed.",
