            "text": "Today's era of globalization is characterized by intensified interspecies encounters, growing ecological concerns and the (re-)emergence of infectious diseases, manifesting themselves in the interplay of medical and biological, but also social, cultural and political processes. One health approaches e which combine multidisciplinary efforts to stimulate collaborations between different health professionals such as veterinarians, medical practitioners, biologists, and public health professionals e can be understood as a response to this complex interconnectedness. Integrating a social science perspective might prove beneficial to this endeavor. This essay locates the one health discussion on disease ecologies in a more than human world within recent developments in cultural and medical anthropology that focus on the entanglements between health and a multitude of animals, plants or microbes, as they are characteristic of a globalized modernity. The paper aims to examine the social dimensions of humaneanimal-diseaseinteractions, claiming that disease is a biocultural phenomenon and that social factors generally play a crucial role in the emergence, spread and management of (infectious) disease. Consequently, it will be argued that there is a need to rethink our objects of inquiry and any given assumptions of human health, the human body or the constitution of \"the global\" as such. Incorporating the social sciences into one health approaches can help address topics such as consumption patterns, humaneanimal behavior or environmental conflicts in a novel way and on a grander scale than ever before. Yet, a greater sensitivity to context may entail some skepticism about the idea of one health e not in spite of the complex entanglements between humans, environments, animals and pathogens, but precisely because of them.",

The contemporary humaneanimal relationship e which is central to this endeavor e is considered to be \"complex and profound, ranging from exploitation of livestock for food and anthropomorphisation of animals as pets, to live 'wet markets' and international trade in animal species\" (Zinstag et al., 2012, p. 107) , and its impact is believed to constitute a threat to all humans on an equal proportion. Most scholars working within this field of research pay particularly close attention to zoonotic diseases e that is, diseases caused by pathogens that can be transmitted from animals to humans and also from humans to animals (e.g., HIV, influenza, Lassa Fever) e and aim to explore the health and disease impact caused by a broad ranges of hosts.",

In this article, the term \"one health\" will be used as a general framework for describing a broad range of approaches that aim to think about human and animal health in an integrative way. \"One World One Health,\" however, is a trademark protected term resulting from an expert consultation in Canada in 2009 (for a detailed description of \"one medicine,\" \"one health\" and \"One Health,\" see Zinstag et al., 2011) . Today, a wide scope of fields, including those in comparative medicine, public health, the environmental sciences, biochemistry, nursing science, and plant pathology, are taking shape under the umbrella term one health, and integrative approaches are institutionalized in organizations such as the WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization or the Resilience Alliance. However, in spite of this heterogeneity, it seems noteworthy to mention that the social sciences are much less present in the one health research-agenda, and it is in this context that central terms and concepts like \"globalization,\" \"nature,\" or the \"body\" might benefit from the integration of a social science perspective.",

            "text": "As this extract explains, it becomes clear that there is a growing recognition that the complexity of disease ecologies brought about by increasing global connectivity can only be explored by international and interdisciplinary cooperation. Since the 1990s, the holistic idea that human health is closely linked to the social, physical and biological environments that people inhabit has become more prominent, as is reflected, for example, by ecohealth and ecosystem approaches which offer the prospect of understanding these complex interactions and translating them into development strategies. Contributions made through the implementation of ecosystem approaches can be foreseen, for example, in the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (RCW), an intergovernmental treaty aimed at the conservation of wetlands e ranging from swamps, lakes and mangroves to coral reefs and fens e and their biological diversity. Since its adoption in 1971, the RCW has provided a framework for international cooperation as well as for national action. Each of the contracting parties, which meet every three years to promote policies and guidelines, have committed themselves to \"work towards the wise use of all their wetlands through national land-use planning, appropriate policies and legislation, management actions, and public education\", to \"designate suitable wetlands for the List of Wetlands of International Importance [\u2026] and ensure their effective management\", and to \"cooperate internationally concerning transboundary wetlands, shared wetland systems, shared species, and development projects that may affect wetlands\" (RCW, 2008, p. 2) . In its 2012 resolution on \"Wetlands and health\", a number of possible contributions to the achievements of the UN's Millennium Development Goals are invoked which illustrate the close interrelationship between wetland ecosystems, environmental health and infectious diseases e and the potential benefits of a programmatic implementation of ecosystem approaches: as many infectious diseases such as diarrhea, cholera or dengue are waterborne or occur in close proximity on water resources, interventions such as primary education in health and water, an increase in ecologically sustainable food production or the implementation of suitable water purification systems might help to overcome pressing health problems as well as to maintain the ecological character of wetlands (RCW, 2012). Although development projects such as these focus on ecosystems and biodiversity, they nevertheless rely heavily on the recognition of human practices and the way they contribute to the shaping of landscapes, water resources and agriculture.",

But, in thinking about contemporary humaneanimal encounters, it may be suggestive to situate them in wider naturalecultural borderlands. That is, seen from the perspective of cultural anthropology, research should question the actual scope, contradictions, effects, and reflections of microbial globalization processes. By applying ethnographic research methods e often including participant observations and in-depth interviews as well as providing a comparative perspective e anthropological approaches are sensitive to everyday practices and the numerous cultural, social, technological, political, and economical contexts within which these practices are enacted. These approaches contest traditional biomedical models accounting for disease emergence and transmission and focus instead on how biomedical knowledge is constructed to evaluate its standards and technologies. One of the most important features of anthropological theory is its recognition of context: in this line of inquiry, biology is no longer considered essentially universal just as culture is now believed to be an integral part of diseases, bodies, and biologies. Whereas the notion of \"one health\" is built upon the assumption of a shared biological destiny, the anthropological perspective might provide useful insights into the wide range of diverging practices, institutions, norms, and bodies that contribute to microbial globalization processes and their governance.",

Epidemiological research on the demographics of malaria movement (Pindolia et al., 2013) or antimicrobial drug resistance (MacPherson et al., 2009 ) bears witness to the fact that human activities e such as interregional migration, waste management or the use of bed nets e have to be integrated into the modeling of infectious disease dynamics in order to fully assess emerging public health risks. Given the case of drug resistant malaria strains, for example, the implementation of successful intervention strategies depends strongly on the identification of transmission patterns, demographic groupings and migratory routines.

While there is no general agreement among social scientists about the meaning, definition, or the consequences of globalization, it is nevertheless of great concern for many of them. It is in this context that Stephen Collier and Aihwa Ong (2005) identify three distinctive approaches to the transformation processes commonly associated with globalization: a tendency to conceptualize a \"new order of things\" (depicted, for example, as modernization or network society); the examination of local articulations of global forces; and finally the revision of some of our discipline's fundamental analytical categories such as \"culture\" or \"scape\" (p. 3). Ong and Collier, however, do not focus on structural transformations as such but they suggest analyzing the shifting forms of global phenomena as they are articulated in specific domains through which \"the forms and values of individual and collective existence are problematized or at stake, in the sense that they are subject to technological, political, and ethical reflection and intervention\" (p. 4). The authors draw on Sarah Franklin's (2005) ethnographic study on the refiguring of traditional notions of governance, biology, and economy in the emergence of a \"global\" stem cell industry, to illustrate how a new form of humanism is brought about, which no longer claims to relate to a certain culture or social group but to humanity and to human life as such. They are keen to emphasize e which is useful for our purposes here e that the actual scope of emerging forms of humanism is not necessarily all-encompassing but is commonly articulated within and closely connected to a particular political and technological setting. A careful observation of those processes that are characterized by instability, contingency and conflict might be useful for understanding how notions of global responsibility, global scope or \"one health\" are invoked within such settings as the implementation of surveillance systems, the marketing and distribution of drugs, or the debates on the property rights over a new virus, as the current example of MERS, the middle east respiratory syndrome, illustrates.",

            "text": "The global (and local) dimensions of cultural practices, norms, and artifacts, lately often discussed as assemblematic or shifting in form, have for a long time held a strong interest for anthropologists working on global health issues. Accordingly, the transnational mobility of risks, body parts, or biomedical standards is one of the most prominent areas of current medical anthropological research (see, for example, Inhorn, 2003; Scheper-Hughes, 2005; Song, 2010; Waldby and Mitchell, 2007) . Thus a number of questions arise in this context: how are technological innovations adapted to local contexts? How do they merge with traditional health behaviors? How are certain diseases conceptualized and treated within different communities? Why do diseases and bodies differ from context to context? Each of the previous questions are well established research questions in fields like medical anthropology, and they provide a rich area of ethnographic research: in his empirical study of dengue control programs in Nicaragua, for example, medical anthropologist Alex Nading (2012) explores why local antidengue campaigns e which advertise a participatory approach by integrating female community workers (brigadistas) into the management of urban mosquito populations e do not seem to solve the problem, in spite of rigorous education campaigns. These campaigns promote the vision of disciplined households where insects and humans are strictly kept apart, and they shift responsibilities to the female member of these households. Nading joined several teams of local brigadistas during their collective encounter, namely the hunt for hidden mosquito breeding sites such as bottle caps, flowerpots or coconut shells. He discovered not only the intimate pleasure of hunting, but also profound discrepancies between scientific attempts of separating insects from humans and the brigadistas' notion to accept their environment as a place of multiple interspecies encounters. Nading's empirical findings stress the close material-semiotic entanglements between women and mosquitoes, both being depicted as \"unsanitary\" and \"undisciplined\" by public health strategies. The author suggests as well, that mosquito intervention campaigns might address the wrong participants: instead of integrating adult women, children would be ideal candidates, claims Nading, as the playfulness of the mosquito hunt and its close relation to urban nature poses an ideal area of activity for children. Consequently, as this study illuminates, the call for more rigorous advertisement campaigns and \"more science\" is doomed to failure. Other anthropological studies illustrate the tensions between local food practices and infectious disease control programs (Lockerbie and Herring, 2009) , scrutinize the impact of Malaria eradication programs on mosquito behavior in the streets of Dar es Salaam (Kelly and Beisel, 2011) or focus on the diverging functions of domestic animals and their role in the transmission of infectious diseases such as Echinococcosis (Fuller and Fuller, 1981) , often presenting critical and surprising clues for understanding complex infectious disease ecologies and potential control of them. It is against this backdrop that scholars, like anthropologist Cecil G. Helman (2007) , depict the very nature of global health strategies as paradoxical and fraught with tension. While the spread of emerging infections, for example, requires health strategies that are global in scale, it is likewise impossible e given the diversity of local social worlds e to develop universal strategies that can be neatly adapted to any local context (p. 451).",

Yet, current epidemiological research suggests that challenges arising from the ongoing globalization of pathogens might be best solved by the application of systemic approaches (Leischow et al., 2008) , which are sensitive of social and environmental contexts and which understand health as a \"quantitative and qualitative interaction and outcome process in socialeecological systems\" (Zinstag et al., 2011, p. 153; Ostrom, 2007) .

While her observation that biological entities do not organize themselves within well-bounded populations is in line with much of the one health approach, she also scrutinizes the underlying notion of the global scale of pandemics. Lowe argues that the framing of the newly emerging H5N1-epidemic as global must not only be understood as a construction but that it also shifted responsibilities from an issue in Indonesian national public health to international intervention initiatives, thereby blaming the native human and chicken populations for posing a threat to mankind worldwide and causing a massive poultry cull. Similar to literary theorist Priscilla Wald (2008) , Lowe makes use of the concept of narrative to underline that the idea of a truly egalitarian threat only masks the fact that the assumed dynamics of the coming pandemic relies on a differentiation between \"there\" (Southeast Asia) and \"here\" (North America and Europe) and thereby articulates fears about a potentially deadly virus being brought to Western industrialized countries.",

Accordingly, we should be able to articulate a critical notion of a more than human world, which rejects any naturalized assumptions about the scope, meaning, and impact of emerging infections. Central to this approach is a perspective that focuses on the social, biological, political, economical, and medical landscapes entangled within the broad diversity of human practices e and human bodies. The recognition of these entanglements does not only contest the very idea of being bounded against otherness but also hints to the fact that humanity e both in its symbolic and material dimensions e is always in a process of formation and becoming, and that spaces of becoming necessarily are fluent and fragmented.",

What factors determine whether an infection will cross a species barrier? What measures will most effectively limit the burden placed on veterinary and human health?\" (p. 5). Answers to these questions, however, will facilitate the development of human and veterinary vaccines as well as the implementation of systems of infectious disease detection, surveillance, and response, but they do not fully exploit the complexity of disease ecologies.

Drawing on the concept of the microbiome, they argue for the integration of interconnected and diverse microbiological perspectives in order to reconceptualize traditional notions of \"life\" or the body. The concept of the microbiome has recently drawn attention to the contribution of microorganisms to the health and physiology of the human body. As multi-species scholars and natural scientists similarly stress, human organs, such as the skin or the intestines, depend on hostebacterial mutualisms that are beneficial to both humans and their microbial partners. B\u20ac ackhed et al. (2005) , for example, picture the gut microbiota as an organ placed within the host's organ: \"It is composed of different cell lineages with a capacity to communicate with one another and the host; it consumes, stores, and redistributes energy; it mediates physiologically important chemical transformations; and it can maintain and repair itself through selfreplication. The gut microbiome, which may contain 100 times Table 1 Approaches to diversity and humaneenvironment-interaction within the natural sciences. 1) Microbiome: Recent genomic studies claim that the human body has to be understood as a supraorganism which not only consists of human cells, but also of a vast number of microbial organisms (such as bacteria, fungi or protozoa), being estimated to outnumber human cells ten to one. The totality of microorganisms and their genetic material, which coexist with the human body e the so-called microbiome e is believed to have a profound impact on the causation of diseases and the maintenance of health. The analysis of microbial communities might help us rethink our understanding of biological and cultural diversity as metagenomic methods provide a window into intra-and interpersonal species variations and their potential impact on health and disease predispositions (Benezra et al., 2012) . Hence, research into the human microbiome also hints at the fact that our bodies are always in the process of formation and becoming, and that these processes are contingent on microbial and other environments. The permanent adaptation of our gut microbiome to changing dietary regimes might be one of the most prominent examples of these interactions. (Dove, 2013; B\u20ac ackhed et al., 2005; Hughes, 2012) . Other studies point to the importance of intestinal microbes in resistance to autoimmune diseases (Leslie, 2012) or to the linkages between microbial and host behavior (Ezenwa et al., 2012) . Combining metagenomic studies, for example on the gut microbiome, with anthropologically informed studies of human social lives and food practices might provide some insight into the complexity of human embodiment within different contexts (Benezra et al., 2012) . 2) Virome: The virome e that is, the totality of viruses coexisting with the (human) body e is a constitutive part of the microbiome, but unlike the latter, not much is known yet about the virome's functions, composition or complexity. While some of these viruses and their genetic information may indeed be linked to the emergence of chronic diseases (e.g., cancer), others seem to provide their hosts with distinctive advantages such as enhanced immune responses to harmful pathogens (Lecuit and Eloit, 2013) . Current approaches identify the human body as a human ecosystem, consisting of human, microbial, viral and other components, all of which are described as being subject to diverging environmental local conditions. Similarly to the microbiome, the virome shows intra-and interpersonal variations (Minot et al., 2013) . 3) Community Ecology: The study of community ecology e a branch of ecological biology e examines how different species interact with one another and with their environments. Central to this approach is the assumption that species organize themselves in communities that vary over time and space and lack distinct boundaries, that they compete for resources such as food, mates, water, air and space, and that different environmental conditions have a profound impact on the outcome of these interactions. Conceptualized as a co-evolutionary and contingent dynamic, numerous mechanisms regulate species diversity; however, scholars of community ecology are particularly concerned with the interrelation between local and broader regional processes and its influence on biodiversity (Mittelbach, 2012; Morin, 2011) . 4) Ecohealth: Closely related to one health approaches, ecohealth or ecosystem approaches aim to help us better understand how ecosystems impact human health and wellbeing. Different from one health scholars, advocates of ecosystem approaches apply a broader perspective on human health by integrating disciplines such as system science, philosophy and geography (Leung et al., 2012; Webb et al., 2010) . The redefinition of human health in terms of sustainability, equity and social justice offers the prospect of understanding complex environmental interactions as well as delivering multi-stakeholder solutions to pressing environmental hazards and healthrelated problems such as noxious effects of occupational toxins or malaria vector control in urban environments.",

Hence, the microbial communities in our bodies are constantly subject to change, depending e among other factors e on age, diet, and environment and hereby are inherently linked to human health. In her ethnographic study on the making of raw-milk cheese in the United States, anthropologist Heather Paxson (2008) makes clear that it is worth investing in the potentialities of human and microbial practices which she understands as cultural and collaborative. She describes how farmers and artisan cheese makers are coupled with the materiality of their specific local soils (the terroir) through milk and cheese consumption, flavor components, and digestive processes, and she suggests that the naturalecultural humanemicrobial entanglements are the ongoing outcome and not the raw material of history and thereby always in a process of formation. What is interesting about her research, for our purposes here, is that it illustrates how the relationship between humans e farmers and cheese makers e and nonhumans e bacteria and milk cattle e is created and modified by cultural practices such as the pasteurization of milk, the feeding of cattle, the use of soap and towels, milking techniques or practices of food preparation. Taking this embeddedness of the human body seriously, particularly by blending biological dynamics, environmental effects and social practice analytically, might help to overcome simplistic \"culturalistic\" causeeeffect relationships and the development of a thorough understanding of human embodiment within distinct historical and spatial contexts and infectious disease ecologies (Lock, 2012, p. 129) . In other words, a critical ethnographically informed exploration of e often unquestioned e concepts such as \"body\" or \"global\" provides an important window into the complexity of the social determinants of health.

Paul Farmer's (1997) insightful account of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in Haiti sheds lights on the embodiment of TB, as he presents the bacterium as contingent of social forces (\"ranging from racism to political violence,\" p. 356). Stressing the social determinants of MDR TB, Farmer makes clear that poor housing conditions, economic inequalities and violence have an impact on the materiality of humanepathogen-interactions within the body which enable the TB bacterium to accumulate resistant mutations, witnessing the multiple ways biology is situated in time and space. Uli Beisel's and Christophe Bo\u20ac ete's (2013) account of genetically modified mosquitoes as an instrument for malaria control describes how insects are transformed from a potentially dangerous vector into a potentially beneficial tool, shifting attention \"away from public health personnel or the people affected by the disease, instead it is centered on the body of the mosquito itself\" (p. 55). Ethnographic approaches such as these can provide useful information on how people in different geographical regions determine whether an agent is a pathogen, on how differences in the enactment of interspecies boundaries relate to patterns of disease transmission or how social activities of humans impact the emergence and spread of microbes. While the above mentioned examples are by no means exhaustive, they might prove to be helpful in reevaluating the larger field of complex disease ecologies and their social determinants.",

As biocultural phenomena, health care practices and the human body have to be situated into the numerous cultural, social, technological, political, and economical contexts within which these practices are enacted. By recognizing infectious disease ecologies as a product of social relations, it becomes apparent that in order to understand the scope and impact of these relations, we cannot rely on any given assumptions about the constitution of human health, the human body, or the constitution of \"the global\" as such. In fact, adding a social science perspective to one health approaches might help to study humaneanimal behavior, food practices, health beliefs, barriers, conflicts and environmental interactions on a much grander scale than ever before. But on the other hand, a greater sensitivity to context may also give rise to doubts about the idea of \"one health\" e not in spite of the complex disease interactions between microbes, domesticated animals and wildlife, humans and their environments, but because of them.",
