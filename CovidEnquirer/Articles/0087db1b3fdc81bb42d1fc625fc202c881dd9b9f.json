Cells used for the analyzes included four IL-2-dependent continuous T-cell lines (104-C1, 104-C7, MCH5-4 and DB FeTs) which arose from long-term passage, followed by limiting dilution cloning of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); two IL-2-independent T-cell lines (104-C1DL and MCH5-4DL) which originated from two of the IL-2-dependent lines, 104-C1 and MCH5-4",

In the simplest case, the lack of a receptor or low affinity interaction with that receptor on a given cell could limit virus infection and spread. The receptor for FIV has yet to be defined, although recent reports indicate that at least certain FIVs interact with the chemokine receptor CXCR4 to facilitate fusion events. Whether CXCR4 is a primary or secondary receptor remains to be determined. A molecule previously thought to be a possible receptor, CD9 (Hosie et al., 1993; Willett et al., 1994) , has recently been shown to be involved in virus release from the cell, rather than entry (de Parseval et al., 1997) . Relative to receptor binding affinity, it has been shown that changes in the V3 region of Env can impart the ability of certain FIVs to productively infect CrFK cells, whereas the parental molecularly cloned FIV could only productively infect PBMCs (Verschoor et al., 1995) . By analogy with HIV-1, this may mean that the V3 region is involved in chemokine receptor interactions Speck et al., 1997) .",

The influence of these sequences on host cell range has yet to be defined. We have recently shown that an intact ORF2 gene, a putative FIV transactivator (Waters et al., 1996) , is necessary for productive growth of FIV-34TF10 on primary T-cells and macrophages (Waters et al., 1996) . Also, a functional deoxyuridine triphosphatase (DU) is necessary for the efficient growth of FIV on primary macrophages, but is not required for growth in actively dividing T-cell lines (Lerner et al., 1995) . Tests in vivo have revealed that DU \u00c0 FIV-PPR is still able to infect the cat, but the distribution of infection is distinct from wild-type FIV-PPR (Lerner et al., 1995) . Also, there is a fivefold increase in mutations in viral DNA isolated from primary macrophages of cats infected with DU \u00c0 FIV, consistent with mutations arising from mis-incorporation of uracil into viral DNA (Lerner et al., 1995) . Although productive viral infection relies on several additional factors, all the above are examples of genotypes that influence growth in one cell environment, but are dispensable in another. Such factors influence the cellular distribution of the infection and this may potentially influence the timecourse, severity, and specificity of the resultant pathology.",

Total RNA was treated with RNAse-free DNAse (Stratagene) in the presence of an RNAse inhibitor (Stratagene) and extracted with phenol/chloroform. cDNA was synthesized using an RT-PCR kit (Stratagene). Table 1 summarizes the analyzes of cell lines employed in this study. The 104-C1, 104-C7, MCH5-4, and DB FeT-cells are uninfected IL-2-dependent cell lines established from long-term culture of PBMCs. The 104-C1 and -C7 cells were isolated from the same cat. The 104-C1 cells are fully infectable by most FIVs analyzed, whereas the 104-C7 cells are refractory to productive infection by all FIVs tested ( Table 2 ). The DB FeT-cell line is very similar to the 104-C1 in morphology (not shown) and virus susceptibility (Table 2 ), but differs in the lack of expression of cytokines IL-4 and IL-6, and lack of CD3 expression ( Table 1 ). The MCH5 cell lines were derived from an FIV-infected cat. All but the MCH5-4 line are either positive for virus expression (Fig. 2(A) ) or are FIV positive by PCR (Fig. 2(B) ). It is interesting that the MCH5-4 cells remained virus negative prior to limiting dilution cloning from the other cells, in spite of the fact that they are fully infectable by most FIVs (Table 2 ). The results imply that MCH5-4 cells differentiated from a non-infectable to infectable phenotype some time after single cell cloning. MCH5-4 cells are similar to 104-C1 in morphology (not shown), and differ only by the lack of expression of IL-4 among the markers and cytokines measured (Table 1) . Important to the present discussion, the overall virus susceptibility of all the three cell lines was similar, in spite of the distinctions noted in cell surface/cytokine expression. In contrast, the 104-C7 cell line, which was completely refractory to infection by all FIVs tested, differed from the susceptible 104-C1 cells only by the lack of expression of CD4 and CD38 among markers examined (Table 1) . However, the lack of these markers did not correlate with failure to infect with FIV, when all cell lines were compared (Table 2) . For example, the virus-producing MCH5-5 cell line lacks both these markers. Thus, the marker analyses described here serve to delineate these cells, but do not explain virus susceptibility per se. Experiments were performed to try to determine the level at which 104-C7 cells were blocked for FIV infection (Fig. 3) . A PCR-based assay (de Parseval et al., 1997 ) was used to assess virus binding to the cell, penetration, reverse transcription, integration, and transcription, as a function of time post acute infection. As shown in Fig. 3(A) , virus bound specifically not only to the fully infectable MCH5-4 and 104-C1 cells, but also to the refractory 104-C7 cells. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3(B) , Gag-specific viral RNA and DNA could be detected in both infectable 104-C1 cells and refractory 104-C7 cells within 3 h post infection, consistent with the notion that the block was not at the level of virus binding or initial penetration events. However, from 24\u00b172 h post infection, both unspliced and multiply spliced viral RNAs accumulated in the productively infected 104-C1 cells, whereas unspliced RNA decreased in the 104-C7 cells and multiply spliced mRNAs were barely detected (Fig. 3(B) ). Additional studies indicated a reduction in closed circular DNA in the 104-C7 cells compared to the 104-C1 cells (not shown), suggestive of a failure of the viral DNA to enter the nucleus. Further studies to delineate this apparent block to virus integration are in progress.",

Of the cell marker/cytokine expressions examined, only the loss of CD9 expression was noted as a correlate with IL-2 independence. Interestingly, the loss of IL-2 dependence changed the susceptibility of the cells to infection with certain FIVs compared to their respective parental lines (Table 2 ). In particular, both IL-2-independent cell lines failed to grow FIV-PPR to high titers after acute infection, in contrast to results with the parental 104-C1 and MCH5-4 cells. FIV-34TF10orf2rep also showed a marked reduction in ability to acutely infect the IL-2-independent cells ( Table 2 ). The simple addition of IL-2 back to the IL-2independent cultures was insufficient to facilitate productive infection by FIV-PPR (Fig. 4) and did not cause reconversion of the cells to IL-2 dependence. However, continuous passage of FIV-PPR on either of the IL-2-independent cells for a period of approximately three weeks resulted in the production of virus (Fig. 4(B) , only data for 104-C1DL shown). The progeny virus, termed FIV-PPRglial could be immediately propagated on 104-C1DL cells and 3201 cells (Fig. 4(A) ). Additionally, FIV-PPRglial, could productively infect CrFK and G355-5 cells (Table 2 ). This result indicates that low-level propagation of FIV-PPR did occur on the IL-2-independent cells, which facilitated sufficient replication to allow adaptation. FIV-PPRglial was also found to be more cytopathic than it's precursor, FIV-PPR on naive cells (Fig. 4(A) ). This phenomenon has also been observed when FIV-Petaluma was passaged through 3201 cells (Tochikura et al., 1990) , though expanded host-cell range was not described.",

Interestingly, the expression of CCR5 on the IL-2-independent MCH5-4DL cell line was very low in the absence of IL-2. As previously found using primate lymphocytes (Xu et al., 1996; Bleul et al., 1997) , higher levels of CCR5 expression could be induced by the addition of exogenous IL-2 (Fig. 5) . However, the increased expression of CCR5 did not result in imparting the ability of FIV-PPR to rapidly infect these cells (Fig. 4(B) ), indicating that some other factor or factors are involved in dictating distinct virus expression as a function of IL-2 dependence.",

Although one must apply caution in extrapolating ex vivo findings to an in vivo setting, the current findings were consistent with in vivo and ex vivo results reported for lentiviral infections including FIV, HIV-1 and SIV. Specifically, it has been reported that IL-4 (Zou et al., 1997; Benveniste et al., 1996) and IFNg (Zou et al., 1997; Cheret et al., 1996; Rosenberg et al., 1997) are upregulated in macaques experimentally infected with SIV and additionally, IFNg expression is upregulated in humans infected with HIV-1 (Breen et al., 1997) . Interleukin-12 is upregulated in both FIV-infected cats (Dean et al., 1997) and in HIV-1-infected humans (Fantuzzi et al., 1996) . Interestingly, IL-4, IL-12 and IFNg were each found to be upregulated in cats upon infection with the coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, FIP (Gunn-Moore et al., 1997) . An upregulation of IL-10 has also been a hallmark of FIV infection in vivo. However, IL-10 expression is generally considered a property of monocyte/macrophage Fig. 6 . Upregulation of MHC class II expression after infection of MCH5-4 cells with FIV-PPR. Cell lysates from 1\u00c210 7 cells, uninfected or infected with FIV-PPR, were prepared and analyzed by Western blot analysis using the anti-feline MHC class II monoclonal antibody CAG5-3DI (Hunt and McConnell, 1995) , and with convalescent cat serum, as detailed in Section 2. and B lymphocytes, which are not represented in our panel of cells. The findings are consistent with a direct effect on upregulation of these cytokines and cell markers as a consequence of FIV infection, rather than an indirect bystander recruitment effect, which may occur in a heterogeneous cell population. However, the findings do not rule out that these proteins may be upregulated sequentially, as a consequence of a cascade initiated by upregulation of one of the cytokines. For example, IL-12 has been shown to upregulate the expression of IFNg, which in turn can upregulate MHC class II. More rigorous examination of the time course of upregulation of each cytokine will determine the order in which upregulation occurs. The well-characterized cell lines described here will facilitate these studies, with a potential to perform both subtraction library and differential display analyzes to identify other upregulated species that may exist as a consequence of FIV infection.",

Since CD4 is the natural ligand for class II antigen, its expression on the surface of the virus in conjunction with the expression of the viral envelope protein gp120 increases the number of potential binding sites between the cell and the virus. This scenario fits well with the FIV model in that FIV preferentially infects cells of the CD4 lineage (Ackley et al., 1990; Novotney et al., 1990; Torten et al., 1991; Willett et al., 1991; Hoffmann-Fezer et al., 1992) .

Virus binding studies, followed by assessment of internalized viral RNA, viral DNA, and spliced viral mRNAs revealed that the block to the infection was not at the level of virus entry. FIV-PPR was able to bind to and infect the 104-C7 cells with essentially the same kinetics as observed with the productively infected 104-C1 cell line. However, analysis of viral DNA synthesis, integration, and appearance of spliced mRNAs revealed a marked reduction in the ability of the virus to integrate into the 104-C7 genome. This, in turn, resulted in a drastic reduction in the production of a new virus and resultant spread in the culture. The reason(s) the virus fails to integrate efficiently in these cells are unclear. One possible explanation is that the majority of viral replication complex fails to enter the nucleus, perhaps because it is shunted into lysosomal vesicles or because of lack of a transport protein. Another possibility is that the 104-C7 cells are deficient in some component needed to facilitate the integration event. Importantly, these cells offer a paradigm for study of cellular control on lentiviral replication, independent of control of virus entry.",

            "text": "The process of adaptation to infection of some of these cell lines by FIV is also of interest. In particular, we noted that FIV-PPR did not immediately grow to high titer on the 3201 cell line. However, after several weeks in culture, a virus emerged that possessed the ability not only to rapidly and productively infect 3201 cells, but also the nonlymphoid CrFK and G355-5 cell lines which were refractory to infection with wild type FIV-PPR. Similar results were noted with FIV-PPR infection of the two IL-2-independent primary cell lines, 104-C1DL and MCH5-4DL. No significant virus growth was noted for several weeks, after which virus (FIV-PPRglial) emerged with expanded host cell range. A simple explanation would be that IL-2 independence corresponded with the loss of a primary receptor used by wild type FIV-PPR. The emerging virus adapted to utilization of a new receptor found on the IL-2-independent cells. Clearly, sufficient infection and replication by wild type FIV-PPR occurred to facilitate the process of adaptation. However, the initial affinity of interaction may have been weak, so that the level of virus replication and spread was very low until mutations occurred to increase the receptor affinity. However, it could also be due to a phenomenon that has nothing to do with receptor binding, such as an internal downregulation of transcription or the lack of components needed for efficient virus release. It is interesting to note that 3201, 104-C1DL, and MCH5-4DL cells share two features: (1) all three cell lines are IL-2independent; and (2) all lack the surface marker CD9. Presumably 3201 cells are IL-2 independent' because they express IL-2 albeit at low levels (Table 1) . However, neither of the IL-2-independent primary cell lines express IL-2, so they are not independent simply because they possess an endogenous source of cytokine. The lack of CD9 expression is particularly interesting, given the previous findings that antibodies to this cell marker can block the propagation of FIV in tissue culture (Hosie et al., 1993; Willett et al., 1994; de Parseval et al., 1997) . However, we have recently shown that this is due to a block in egress, rather than to blocking of a CD9 interaction at the point of entry (de Parseval et al., 1997) . One possibility is that the lack of CD9 on the three cell lines requires that the virus adapt to an alternative pathway for egress. As with the cytokine responses noted above, the use of subtraction libraries and/or differential display on the IL-2-dependent and independent versions of 104-C1 and MCH5-4 will prove invaluable to defining the cellular distinctions that dictate each unique infection phenotype.",

In addition, we found that some of the primary T-cell lines could become IL-2-independent, and that commensurate with IL-2 independence, came a change in susceptibility to infection with certain FIVs. Adaptation to growth on these cells was observed after several weeks in culture, with resultant expansion of the host cell range and cytopathogenicity of the progeny virus. The cell lines described here offer a manipulable venue to further define the molecular mechanisms that control both the hostcell responses to viral infection and to identify factors that control the level and range of the virus expression.",

In steps 1 and 2, double-stranded arms were amplified from oligonucleotides encoding feline cytokine-and cell marker-specific sequences.

In step 5, the DNA fragments were ligated, and then used as a template in a final PCR to create a full-length construct (step 6). Finally, in step 7, the construct was ligated into the TA cloning vector and transformed into E. coli for DNA production. DNA was purified and quantitated as detailed in Section 2.",
