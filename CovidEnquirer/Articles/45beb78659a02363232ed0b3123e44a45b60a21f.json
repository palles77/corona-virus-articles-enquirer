Gatherings can be short term (for a few hours as in a sporting event or concert) or longer (for several days to weeks, as in the Olympic Games or the hajj). A gathering can be held at one location or spread over different sites. The sizes of mass gatherings vary. For example, there were around 3.4 million spectators during the FIFA World Cup in Brazil in 2014; the hajj pilgrimage usually attracts some 2 million Muslims each year; the Hindu pilgrimage Kumbh Mela in India can attract up to 130 million pilgrims. There is no consensus on a threshold of the number of people that constitute a mass gathering.",

The influx of large numbers of people, often from different parts of the world, and the infrastructural changes needed to support them are a formidable challenge for any public health system. Effective management of mass casualty incidents requires coordinated efforts across a wide variety of sectors.

Surveillance and public health response may not be developed for diseases that are usually not endemic in the host country. Gatherings with international participants potentially pose specific challenges for implementing control measures, such as contact tracing in case of an outbreak.

Saudi Arabia has developed a comprehensive program, which is updated annually to ensure that all aspects of hajj rituals are conducted safely and without major incident. 17 The inevitable overcrowding in a confined area of such large numbers increases the risk of respiratory infections. The hajj has historically been associated with outbreaks of meningococcal disease, with a major outbreak of serogroup A occurring in 1998. 4, 5 In response to this outbreak, the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia introduced vaccination against serogroup A as a hajj visa requirement. In 2000 and 2001 outbreaks of meningococcal disease due to W135 serogroup were reported, including a high acquisition rate of W135 meningococcal carriage. 18 Returning pilgrims with W135 carriage triggered various clusters of W135 meningococcal disease in household contacts. 19 Tetravalent meningococcal vaccine covering A, C, Y, and W135 became a mandatory hajj visa requirement in 2002, and no further hajj-related outbreaks occurred. The Saudi Ministry of Health also introduced eradication of meningococcal carriage through administering single-dose antibiotics to pilgrims arriving from the African meningitis belt. Monitoring carriage states of visitors and local inhabitants in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as the implementation of preventive measures that impact carriage, are warranted to reduce the risk of hajj-related and umrah-related meningococcal disease outbreaks. 20 Although H1N1 was a concern prior to Hajj 2009, massive amplification of this pandemic through the hajj did not take place, partly because of the preventive measures that were taken, and partly because Hajj 2009 took place at the tail end of the epidemic. 21 system enhancement. Event planners and other stakeholders are advised to work in close collaboration with local public health officials when planning events, taking into account local factors while conducting a risk assessment of the event. Preplanning includes a multisectoral approach that includes assessing the local health services, medical emergency services and blood supply, local law enforcement, and public health preparation for potential nuclear, biologic, chemical, and explosive terrorist actions. It also includes ensuring food safety, air quality, and vector control where needed. These are critical to identifying potential public health risks, both natural and manmade, and to preventing, minimizing, and responding to all emergencies.",

With regard to immunizations, particular attention should be given to recommending influenza vaccination, updating the tetanus/pertussis/diphtheria status, and ensuring that primary schedules for polio vaccination have been completed. For those traveling from areas where wild poliovirus is still circulating, polio vaccination 4 weeks prior to departure should be given. Yellow fever vaccination should be given for those traveling from yellow fever-endemic countries to countries where Aedes mosquitoes exist. Furthermore, the importance of being immune against measles cannot be overemphasized, particularly in light of declining vaccine coverage rates in some countries, highlighting that routine immunizations should be up to date. If prolonged crowding conditions are to be expected, quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine may be indicated. The quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine is a hajj visa requirement. As much as possible, travelers must be made aware of the risk of stampede, so that they are aware of the danger and can avoid critical situations.",

The influx of large numbers of people and accompanying infrastructural changes to support such events pose tremendous challenges for the public health system-including risk of importing infectious diseases, amplifying transmission and further spread spreading of infectious disease through global mobility networks. Although infectious diseases during mass gatherings may be of greater concern to global public health, noncommunicable diseases (eg. accidents and stampedes) are shown to have higher local impact with respect to morbidity and mortality during such gatherings.",
