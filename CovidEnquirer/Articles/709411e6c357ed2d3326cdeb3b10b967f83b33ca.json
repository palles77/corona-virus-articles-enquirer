The ICD-coding system allows physicians and professional coders to express their diagnostic impression of a patient at different levels of diagnostic precision, ranging from very precise (e.g., ICD code 022.1 for inhalational anthrax) to syndrome (e.g., ICD code 079.99 for viral syndrome) to symptom (e.g., ICD code 780.6 for fever). The diagnosis may be a working diagnosis (a provisional diagnosis) or a definitive diagnosis, although ICD does not allow the clinician or coder to indicate this distinction. A clinician or professional coder may record an ICD code early in the process of medical care. Professional coders, not clinicians, invariably encode hospital discharge diagnoses, which are not available until after a patient is discharged from a hospital. The important points to remember about ICD coding are the heterogeneity in diagnostic precision, who does the encoding, and when the encoding is done.",

FIG U R E 2 3.1 Points in the healthcare process at which chief complaints and ICD codes are recorded and transmitted to a health department or other biosurveillance organization. This figure illustrates a hypothetical patient with anthrax who seeks care at an emergency department (ED) and is subsequently admitted to a hospital. The patient's chief complaint is recorded at the time of registration and transmitted immediately to a health department via a HL7 message router. When the patient is discharged from the ED and admitted to the hospital, a professional coder reads the patient's ED chart and assigns ICD codes for billing purposes. The delay in transmission to a health department is indicated by a slanted arrow. Another ICD code may be assigned at the time of hospital admission. Finally, ICD codes are assigned by professional coders at the time of hospital discharge. These codes are transmitted to third party payers, who may submit them to data aggregators (e.g., commercial companies that analyze healthcare trends or health departments that assemble hospital discharge data sets for statistical purposes). In general, the diagnostic precision of the data available to a health department increases over time (moving from left to right in the figure). Note that there is variability from healthcare system to healthcare system. In some settings, the chief complaints are coded directly into ICD codes by physicians at the time of service (e.g., U.S. military).",

The syndromes used in automated analysis of chief complaints and ICD codes are diagnostically imprecise by intent. The developers of these syndromes recognize that chief complaints (and ICD-coded diagnoses obtained close to the time of admission) in general do not contain sufficient diagnostic information to classify a patient as having SARS or other more diagnostically precise syndrome. They create syndrome definitions that are sufficiently precise to be useful, but not so precise that few if any patients will be assigned to them automatically, based solely on information contained in a four-or five-word chief complaint (or ICD code assigned early during the process of medical care). Table 23 .2 is the set of syndromes used by the RODS system. The table shows each syndrome name (which is just a convenient handle to reference the syndrome definition) and its definition. The RODS system uses the syndrome definitions in two ways. First, it makes them available to epidemiologists and other users of the system to assist in interpreting time series and maps of chief complaint data that have been aggregated by syndrome. If the user sees an increase in a syndrome such as respiratory, his interpretation of the increase should be that it could be due to any disease that is consistent with the definition of the respiratory syndrome. Second, RODS provides the definitions to individuals who are developing training sets (discussed in Chapter 17) for the CoCo parser. 3 Tables 23.3 and 23.4 are syndrome classification systems used by Maryland Department of Hygiene and Mental Health and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, respectively.",

A limitation of the two-step approach is that it has not been validated. A real concern is that users of such systems can define syndromes for which the system's sensitivity and specificity may be extremely poor. A user may create a syndromic definition that is rational from an epidemiological standpoint but is not well-suited to the input data being classified. Without deep knowledge of the underlying processing method and its assumptions, a user will be completely unaware of this phenomenon and may be falsely reassured by the absence of disease activity when the newly created syndrome is put into operational use. As an extreme example of this problem, consider that a user might define a syndrome as a Boolean conjunction (AND statement) of five symptoms. Since the average registration chief complaint comprises four words, it is almost inconceivable that any patient would match such a syndrome definition. 4",

Several publications describe the technical approach to HL7based data collection and chief-complaint processing (Tsui et al., 2002 , 2003 , 2003 , Olszewski, 2003a . Briefly, when a patient registers for care at an ED, a triage nurse or registration clerk enters the chief complaint into a registration system. This step is part of normal workflow in many U.S. hospitals (Travers et al., 2003) . The registration system almost always transmits chief-complaints in the form of HL7 messages to an HL7-message router located in the healthcare system. To transmit these data to a biosurveillance organization, the healthcare system would configure the HL7-message router to de-identify these messages and transmit them via the Internet to a biosurveillance organization as they are received from the registration system. This configuration process is a native capability of commercial HL7-message routers and it is a routine task for an HL7 engineer or other information technology staff working in or for a healthcare system.",

These studies require chief complaint data collected from multiple healthcare facilities in a region affected by an outbreak. Research groups often expend significant time and effort building biosurveillance systems to collect the chief complaint data needed to conduct this type of research. Because outbreaks are rare events, many of the studies we will discuss are of common diseases such as influenza or of seasonal outbreaks (winter) that may be caused by multiple organisms. Adequate sample size (of outbreaks) is difficult to achieve in studies of outbreak detection. Only one of the studies computed a confidence interval on its measurements of sensitivity or time of outbreak detection. The scientific importance of adequate sample size cannot be overstated. There are two possible approaches to increasing sample size: (1) conduct research in biosurveillance systems that span sufficiently large geographic regions that they are expected to encounter sufficient numbers of outbreaks, or (2) meta-analysis. To emphasize the importance of adequate sample size, we divide this section into studies of multiple outbreaks (labeled N>I), prospective studies, and studies of single outbreaks (N=I).",

As a result, the syndromes used in research have many causes other than acute infectious diseases, which are the diseases of interest in biosurveillance. When monitoring aggregate daily counts, even a syndrome with 100% specificity will show baseline levels of counts in the absence of an outbreak due to the presence of these chronic and sporadic conditions. Prospective Studies. Prospective studies are field evaluations of a biosurveillance system. In a prospective evaluation, the detection algorithms are operated at a fixed detection threshold for an extended period and the ability of the biosurveillance system to detect known outbreaks or to identify new outbreaks is measured. Heffernan et al. (2004b) used the detection-algorithm method prospectively to study respiratory and fever syndrome monitoring in New York City (Heffernan et al., 2004b included that year in a three-year analysis, so we do not discuss it here. In New York City, EDs transmit chief complaints to the D O H M H on a daily basis as email attachments or via FTR The researchers estimated that the D O H M H system received chief complaint data for approximately 75% of ED visits in New York City. The NLP program was a keyword-based system that assigned each patient to exactly one syndrome from the set: common cold, sepsis~dead on arrival, respiratory, diarrhea,fever, rash, asthma, vomiting, and other (Table 23 .4). The NLP program was greedy, which means that the algorithm assigned a patient to the first syndrome from the list of syndromes whose definition was satisfied and did not attempt further assignment.",

In 36 of these outbreaks, few or no patients went to EDs. In two outbreaks, the victims were visitors to New York City who returned to their homes before onset of symptoms. In three outbreaks, victims visited EDs not participating in the monitoring system. In three outbreaks, victims visited EDs over a \"days or weeks\" (the algorithms used by DOHMH were sensitive to rapid increases, not gradual increases in daily counts of syndromes). In two outbreaks, the victims presented to the ED as a group and their chief complaints were recorded by reference to the group (e.g., \"school incident\"). In two outbreaks, a combination of the above causes explained the failure. N=I Studies. Irvin and colleagues (Irvin et al., 2003) used the detection-algorithm method to retrospectively study the ability of their anthrax syndrome to detect a single influenza outbreak. The paper is not explicit about the anthrax syndrome, but states, \"The presence of any of the following symptoms were sufficient to categorize a patient into anthrax: cough, dyspnea, fever, lethargy, pleuritic chest pain, vomiting, generalized abdominal pain, or headache,\" suggesting that the researcher included symptoms with which pulmonary anthrax may present. They studied an atypical monitoring system based on numeric chief-complaint codes from a commercial ED charting system. This charting system, called E/Map (Lynx Medical Systems, Bellevue WA, http://www.lynxmed.com), offers clinicians charting templates for approximately 800 chief complaints. Each template has a numerical code. A clinician's selection of charting template reflects the patient's chief complaint. The detection algorithm used a fixed detection threshold set at two standard deviations from a recent two-month mean. The algorithm signaled when two of the previous three days exceeded the threshold. The reference standard was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined peak week of influenza activity. The system signaled one week prior to the CDC peak and signaled one false positive. Yuan et al. (2004) used the detection-algorithm method to study the timeliness of detection of one influenza outbreak in southeastern Virginia. They manually assigned chief complaints to seven syndromes (fever, respiratory distress, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, disorientation, and sepsis). The detection algorithm was CUSUM, operated at three different moving averages (7-day window, window days 3-9, and 3-day window) and set at a threshold of 3 S.D. They reported that the CUSUM algorithm detected trends in fever and respiratory in one hospital that preceded the local sentinel influenza surveillance system by one week.",

Clinicians rarely have formal training in the rules for assigning codes. They typically have little time to ensure that the codes they assign are accurate. They often view the assignment of ICD codes to patient encounters as a distraction from patient care. To address these problems, physicians often use preprinted encounter forms that have check boxes for an extremely small subset of commonly used codes. Although these forms typically include a blank space to write in additional ICD codes, clinicians are extremely busy so an open question is how often they use the space and how accurate are the ICD codes that are hand entered. Another question is whether busy clinicians, who do not use the data on the encounter form for subsequent patient care, completely code all diagnoses made during a patient visit. One study found that, during patient visits, physicians addressed an average 3.05 patient problems but documented only 1.97 on billing forms (they documented nearly as many problems in the paper record as they addressed) (Beasley et al., 2004) .",

The other code sets that researchers describe in the literature were created for research studies. For example, Lazarus et al. (2002) used a slight modification of ESSENCE code sets and also created an influenza-like illness (ILI) code set. They based this code set on the CDC sentinel surveillance definition of ILI, which is fever (body temperature measured in the office > 37.8~ plus cough or sore throat without a known cause. Miller and colleagues created an ILI code set that includes 31 ICD codes (Miller et al., 2004) . Most of the codes in the set are symptoms of influenza. Ritzwoller et al. (2005) created an ILI code set. This code set included codes for respiratory illness plus fever (780.6). Espino and Wagner (2001a) created a respiratory code set that includes 64 ICD codes. To create this code set, experts reviewed all ICD codes assigned as ED chief complaints over a three-year period. Tsui et al. (2001) created an influenza code set from this respiratory code set and viral illness ICD codes . Ivanov created a gastrointestinal code set that includes 16 ICD codes (Ivanov et al., 2002) . As with Espino and Wagner (2001a) , experts reviewed all ICD codes assigned as ED chief complaints over a three-year period. Beitel et al.

To create the respiratory code set, they merged ICD codes 460.00-519.xx (encompasses all \"diseases of the respiratory system\"), 786.xx (encompasses all \"symptoms involving the respiratory system and other chest symptoms\"), and the ESSENCE respiratory code set except ICD code 079.99 (Viral syndrome). They then divided respiratory into lower respiratory and upper respiratory based on the part of the respiratory system implied by the code. When a code did not imply any anatomy or implied anatomy that spanned the upper and lower parts of the respiratory system, they added it to the upper respiratory set.",

Given the variability in diseases, ICD assignment by clinicians and coders, and diagnostic precision, it is unlikely that a one-size-fits-all ICD code set will be optimal for all settings and purposes. Moreover, it is trivial for computer systems to aggregate raw ICD-coded data using any desired code set in real time and as needed. 1~ We note that identifying an optimal code set is not trivial. A computer scientist would, in fact, call it an intractable problem, which means that it cannot be done. The reason: there are 10 A single microchip cannibalized from a discarded DVD player likely has sufficient processing power to keep up with all the ICD-to-code set translations required for biosurveillance by the entire world. approximately 12,000 ICD-9 codes and therefore 212,000 possible ICD code sets. This number is far greater than the total number of atoms in the universe or the number of milliseconds since the beginning of time. Thus, it is not possible for a computer, let alone a human, to try every code set to find the best one. That is not to say that it is not possible to determine whether Code Set A is superior to Code Set B for some specific biosurveillance application, just that it is not possible to establish that Code Set A is superior to every other code set for all ICD-coded data.",

But it is worthwhile to review the steps in the process of assigning ICD codes and transmitting them to a biosurveillance system (Figure 23.1) , and how these steps may contribute to time latency. First, an individual clinician or coder must acquire enough information about a patient to assign an ICD code. This individual may be a triage nurse who obtains the patient's chief complaint within minutes of the patient's arrival to the ED, or a professional coder who studies a four-inch thick medical record weeks after the patient left the hospital. Next, someone must enter an ICD code into a computer system. 11 For physician-assigned ICD codes, that may occur within minutes after she sees the patient (which in turn may be minutes to hours after the patient arrived at the office or ED) or even hours or days after the patient leaves the office or ED. Finally, the computer system must transmit the codes to a biosurveillance system or other computers that in turn transmit them to a biosurveillance system. Systems may either transmit ICD codes in real time (the exception) or in batch mode (the rule). Ideally, studies of ICD codes would measure and report the contribution of each step to overall time latency. Studies to datemwith one exception we discuss belowmhave not measured time latencies involved in ICD-code monitoring. Instead, authors provide general statements such as most records were received by the next day. Lewis et al. (2000) report a one-to three-day time latency for diagnoses encoded with ICD by physicians working at DoD clinics. They state that this latency is from the time of the patient visit to the time data are available for viewing and analysis in the ESSENCE biosurveillance system. They note two factors that affect this time latency: time delays prior to physicians assigning codes and frequency of data transmission to ESSENCE from the DoD's Ambulatory Data System.",

It is important to note that this study was of an atypical health system that expended effort to make physician-assigned ICD codes available to a biosurveillance system in real time, instead of using daily batch-mode extraction of ICD codes as other studies have described. Espino found that ICD codes for diagnoses (assigned by ED physicians) arrived at the RODS system on average 7.5 hours after ICD codes for chief complaints (assigned by ED registration clerks). The maximum time delay was 80.6 hours. Because the ICD codes for chief complaints and diagnoses were transmitted in real time, this measurement of time latency includes only a negligible transmission delay. Thus, nearly all of the 7.5 hours comprises patient waiting time, time for the physician to see the patient, and time for the physician to assign ICD codes to the visit using a point-of-care system.",

They studied the ability of ICD codes for ED chief complaints and ICD codes for ED diagnoses to detect patients with acute respiratory syndrome (defined as symptom duration of five days or less). In this ED, registration clerks assigned ICD codes to the chief complaints and ED physicians assigned ICD codes to the diagnoses at the time of the patient's visit. Two internists created the gold standard by reviewing the dictated ED visit note and assigning patients to acute respiratory if the duration of illness was five days or less and the patient had respiratory symptoms, abnormal pulmonary examination, or radiological evidence of pneumonia. The sensitivity and specificity of a respiratory ICD code set (that contained 64 ICD codes) for detecting patients with acute respiratory illness from chief complaints were 0.44 and 0.97, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the same respiratory code set for detecting patients with acute respiratory illness from diagnoses were 0.43 and 0.97, respectively. The accuracy of ED diagnoses was not significantly different from the accuracy of ED chief complaints. Betancourt (2003) studied the case detection accuracy of three DoD-GEIS ICD code sets. He used manual review of medical records by two primary care physicians as the gold standard. He found that the sensitivity of the respiratory, fever, and gastrointestinal code sets was 0.65, 0.71, and 0.90, respectively. All three code sets had a specificity of 0.94. Ivanov et al. (2002) studied the case detection accuracy of ICD codes for the detection of acute gastrointestinal illness (duration of illness two weeks or less) in EDs. ED physicians assigned ICD codes for diagnoses after seeing a patient. Review of the transcribed emergency-department report by two internists was the gold standard. As in the study by Espino and Wagner, the internists were instructed to label a patient as acute gastrointestinal if symptoms were of duration two weeks or less. They found that an ICD code set (that contained 16 ICD codes) had a sensitivity and specificity of 0.32 and 0.99, respectively, for the detection of acute gastrointestinal syndrome. Beitel et al. (2004) studied the case detection accuracy of ICD codes for the detection of respiratory, lower respiratory, and upper respiratory syndromes in a pediatric ED. They do not state whether physicians or billing administrators assigned the ICD codes that they studied (but mention that both groups assign ICD codes to ED visits). They used singlephysician review of the medical record as the gold standard. The sensitivity and specificity of their respiratory ICD code set was 0.70 and 0.98, respectively, for detection of respiratory syndrome. Similarly, the sensitivity and specificity of their upper respiratory ICD code set was 0.56 and 0.98 for upper Espino, J., Wagner, M. (2001a) .

They used correlation analysis and the detection-algorithm method to study the accuracy and timeliness of an ILl and a respiratory ICD code set for the detection of an influenza outbreak. TM Pneumonia and influenza (P&I) deaths were used as the gold-standard determination of the outbreak. The correlation analysis showed a two-week lead time for both ICD code sets relative to P&I deaths. 15 The detection algorithm analysis used the Serfling algorithm.

Detection of the influenza outbreak occurred one week earlier from both code sets relative to detection from P&I deaths at these false alarm rates and measurements of sensitivity. Miller et al. (2004) used correlation analysis and the detection algorithm method to study the ability of ICD data obtained from a large healthcare organization in Minnesota to detect an influenza outbreak. Using P&I deaths as a gold standard, Miller demonstrated a significant Pearson correlation of 0.41 of an ILl ICD cede set with P&I deaths. When they lagged the ILI time series by one week, the Pearson correlation remained 0.41. For the detection-algorithm method, they used a CUSUM algorithm. CUSUM detected the outbreak from ILl (sensitivity of 1/1) one day earlier than the date the health department confirmed the first positive influenza isolate. They did not report the false alarm rate of the CUSUM algorithm for this detection sensitivity and timeliness. Lazarus et al. (2002) used correlation analysis to study the ability of ICD codes to detect an influenza outbreak (Lazarus et al., 2002) . They obtained the ICD codes from a point-of-care system used by a large multispecialty physician group practice. Clinicians assigned ICD-coded diagnoses at the time of either an in-person or phone consultation. They used hospital discharge data as a gold standard. They created two time series using the same lower respiratory ICD code set (based on the DoD-GEIS respiratory code set): one from their point-of-care data and one from the hospital discharge data. The maximum correlation of these time series was 0.92 when point-of-care ICD codes preceded hospital-discharge ICD codes by two weeks. Lewis et al. (2002) used correlation analysis to study the ability of ICD codes to detect an outbreak of influenza. They used CDC sentinel physician data for influenza as a gold standard. Physicians assigned ICD codes at outpatient DoD facilities. The correlation of the DoD-GEIS respiratory code set with the CDC sentinel physician data was 0.7. They did not measure the correlation at time lags other than zero. Suyama et al. (2003) used correlation analysis to study whether ICD codes contain a signal of notifiable diseases reported to the health department. They used health department data about notifiable diseases as a gold standard. Billing administrators assigned ICD codes to ED visits.

Outbreaks vary in their rapidity, early syndromic presentation, and whether they cause people to seek hospital care versus outpatient care. It is likely that future research will show that chief complaints are superior to ICD codes for monitoring for some outbreaks and ICD codes are superior for other outbreaks. At the present time, the strongest statement about their respective roles is that chief complaints--because of the low time latency--may prove to be more useful for detecting sudden events.

Research to date has demonstrated that they can be readily obtained from emergency departments and hospitals, more often than not in real time as HL7 messages. They are less accessible in the outpatient setting. Chief complaints must be subject to NLP to extract information for biosurveillance. The two basic approaches are keyword matching and Bayesian text processing. The NLP assigns a chief complaint either directly to a syndrome category, or extracts symptoms that are then further processed in a second step to determine whether the patient matches a Boolean case definition. Research on the accuracy of automatic syndrome assignment from chief complaints shows that automatic classification from chief complaint data into syndromes such as respiratory and gastrointestinal can be accomplished with moderately good sensitivity and specificity. This accuracy is not sufficient to support detection of small outbreaks. When researchers have attempted to automatically assign patients to more diagnostically precise syndromes such as febrile respiratory, sensitivity declines quicklymchief complaints simply do not contain sufficient information to support such automatic assignments. Research has also demonstrated that detection algorithms can use daily counts of syndromes derived in this manner to detect large respiratory or diarrheal outbreaks such as those due to influenza and rotavirus. It is likely that large outbreaks of diseases that initially present with other syndromes monitored for would also be detected, although studies of such outbreaks do not yet exist, so this point remains a matter of opinion.",

They are far more heterogeneous in meaning than chief complaints as the ICD coding system contains codes for symptoms, syndromes, and diagnoses at different levels of diagnostic precision. Additionally, codes are collected at multiple points during the course of a patients illness and the accuracy and diagnostic precision of coding may vary across these points. ICD codes become available later in the course of the clinical care than chief complaints. From the perspective of biosurveillance, they contain indirect information about a patient's symptoms: the reasoning process that developers use when they include an ICD code in a \"code set\" is \"would a patient with disease X have respiratory symptoms? If so, let's include the code for disease X in a code set for respiratory.\" Research to date has demonstrated that ICD codes can be readily obtained from the healthcare system. The military fortuitously uses ICD to encode all services (and doctors do the encoding). There are several examples of ICD code sets developed for biosurveillance. A surprisingly small amount of work has been done on developing very specific ICD codes sets to automate the surveillance for conditions such as pneumonia. Research on the accuracy of automatic syndrome assignment shows results similar to chief complaints. As with chief complaints, this accuracy is not sufficient to support detection of small outbreaks. Research on the accuracy of automatic disease assignment using hospital discharge diagnoses shows higher accuracy. Research has also demonstrated that detection algorithms can use daily counts of syndromes derived in this manner to detect large respiratory or diarrheal outbreaks such as those due to influenza and rotavirus.

When the availability of additional clinical data (e.g., temperatures and laboratory test orders or results) allows monitoring of more diagnostically precise syndromes, we expect that smaller outbreaks will be detectable and the time of detection of larger outbreaks will improve.
