            "text": "Background: Patient-centered care (PCC) and integrative care approach are widely advocated. However, their implementation usually requires an extended consultation time. Despite significant advances in medical diagnosis and treatment, no studies have examined consultation time and patient centeredness in Korea. Methods: We conducted a \"15-Minute Consultation\" for first-time patients in outpatient clinics of 13 departments. A control group was selected from the same physicians' first-time patients, adjusting for age and gender. A total of 275 patients were selected for receiving in-depth consultation and 141 control patients were selected for regular consultation. Data were collected from patients using a questionnaire comprising a patient-centeredness scale and items on potential predictors such as socio-demographic and clinical factors. We also investigated the participating physician's professionalism. Results: As compared to the control group, the in-depth consultation group scored higher on 5 variables associated with PCC, including (patients' perception of ) medical professionals, wait and consultation times, treatment, patient advocacy, and patient satisfaction. While 92.4% of patients in the in-depth consultation group reported that the consultation time was sufficient, only 69.0% of those in the control group reported the same (P < 0.01). In the in-depth consultation group, scores on satisfaction level were the highest for the department of internal medicine, followed by departments of surgery and pediatrics. Participating physicians' improved satisfaction following the intervention proved that in-depth consultation facilitated building a rapport with patients. Conclusion: This study illustrated that the provision of sufficiently long consultation for serious and rare diseases could improve PCC and physicians' professionalism. Health authorities should reshuffle the healthcare delivery system and provide sufficient consultation time to ensure PCC and medical professionalism.",

In Korea, short consultation time in tertiary hospitals is attributed to 1) low reimbursement rate and the fee-for-service system, 2) patients' preference for a tertiary hospital, and 3) lack of gate-keeping or a referral system.",

In 2018, it was expanded to include 19 tertiary hospitals across the country. It is remarkable that this project was not a government-led policy; instead, it was a hospital-led pilot project propelled by the awareness of expert groups about the distorted healthcare delivery system. This 6-month study took place in the largest public tertiary hospital in Korea, which exhibited an average consultation time of merely 3.3 minutes for first-time patients. Patients with first-visit consultations for serious and non-curable diseases (four serious diseases: cancer, stroke, coronary artery disease, and rare and intractable disorders defined by regulations) in the outpatient clinic were assigned to an in-depth consultation group or a control group. We aimed to explore the differences in patient-centeredness, willingness to pay, and physician's professionalism with reference to consultation time. system for first-time patients in outpatient clinic based on the willingness of a few physicians to change outpatient clinic behavior and encourage shared decision making. In the previous \"15-Minute Consultation\" system, patients did not undergo a gate-keeping system and were therefore easily assessable by self-referral. To decrease this behavior, we tightly restricted the patient influx by introducing a gate-keeping system to establish an improved healthcare delivery system and sophisticated outpatient care in tertiary hospitals.",

This indicated that sufficient consultation time was the most potent factor for facilitating PCC and physicians' satisfaction.",

Additionally, type of disease, duration of disease, and patient's residence can subjectively influence patient centeredness. Lastly, we did not investigate the quality of the consultation, which is an important factor. It could have been measured by audio-or videotaping the consultations, but this was not captured or evaluated in our study due to the use of a selfreport questionnaire.",
