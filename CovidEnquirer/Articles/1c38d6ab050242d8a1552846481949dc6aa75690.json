We investigated distinctive clinical features of HBoV-positive children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Methods and results During April 2007-July 2009, for 402 hospitalized children younger than 2 years with LRTI, we prospectively examined virus genomes in nasopharyngeal swabs for HBoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenzavirus, and adenovirus. The HBoV genomes were identified in 34 patients (8.5%). Clinical and laboratory data of HBoV-positive and other virus/bacteria-negative patients (n=18) were analyzed and compared with data of RSV-single positive patients (n=99). The seasonal distribution of HBoV exhibits a concentration of cases during March-September, with most RSV cases occurring during winter in Japan. The minimum age of HBoV-positive patients was 5 months, although 44 patients (44%) with RSV were younger than 6 months. The main clinical features were respiratory distress and hypoxia. Hypoxia advances within 3 days after onset. The mean oxygen saturation on arrival was 92.8%, which was significantly lower than that in patients with RSV (p< 0.001). White blood cell counts were similar among groups. However, the percentage of neutrophils in white blood cells were significantly higher in HBoV-positive patients (62 vs. 45%, p<0.001). Their prognoses were good. Their hospital stays were 6.6 days. Conclusions HBoV-single positive patients show several clinical characteristics, such as seasonality, age, hypoxia, and neutrophilia, which differ from those with RSV infection.",

In fact, HBoV is detected year round, with rates of 0.5-19% in patients with LRTI [2, 7, 13, 15, 26] . Recently, this virus is propagated in an in vitro culture system [10] .

Then PCR/reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using previously described methods with slight modifications [1, 3, 4, 9, 22, 24] . Briefly, for the RNA viruses, a superscript one-step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for reverse-transcription and first-round PCR with virus specific primers under the manufacturer's instructions. For DNA viruses and also nested PCR, Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) was used along with the manufacturer's supplied buffer under the appropriate thermal cycle conditions for each primer. Each sample was examined for RSV, rhinovirus (RV), hMPV, HBoV, adenovirus (AdV), and parainfluenzavirus (PIV). Following amplification, PCR products were separated on the 1.5% agarose gel with Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer and visualized with SYBR-green (Cambrex Corp., Rockland, ME, USA) under a UV transilluminator. The PCR products were purified; their nucleic acid sequences were determined to confirm PCR results. Nucleotide sequences were processed using software (GENETYX) and compared to nucleotide sequences of the DNA database using a BLAST system [20].",

Specific examination of extremely young patients revealed a clear difference in the age distribution of HBoV-positive patients from that of RSV. In RSV-positive patients, 44% of all patients were younger than 6 months. In contrast, the minimum age of HBoV-positive patients was 5 months. Endo et al. measured the levels of the antibody in human serum samples aged from 0 months to 41 years and reported that the seropositive rate was lowest in the age group of 6-8 months [12] .

In our study, oxygen saturation on admission shows that hypoxia was more severe in HBoV-positive patients than in RSV-positive patients. Moreover, the short duration from disease onset to admission shows that respiratory distress and hypoxia progress rapidly in HBoV-positive patients. Oikawa et al. recently reported a severe case with HBoV associated with plastic bronchitis, which necessitated mechanical ventilation [21] . Many previous reports have not described severe cases of HBoV infection; however, the sample size is small and the studies were retrospective. In our study, one out of 18 patients had severe pneumonia and remained hospitalized for 19 days. A larger number of cases with HBoVpositive LRTI must be accumulated to discuss the disease severity. Patients with RSV infection sometimes need intensive care. Pediatricians have specifically addressed the care and protection of this infection. One reason is that the RSV infection is frequently found in infants who are younger than 3 months. Furthermore, patients younger than 3 months often require intensive care. In contrast, the minimum age of HBoV-positive patient is 5 months in our study. Therefore, the difference in the age of patients might affect the disease severity.",

It is particularly interesting that the rate of neutrophils in hMPV-positive patients is similar to that in RSV-positive patients (data not shown). This parameter might strongly support clinical diagnosis of LRTI with HBoV. Acute hypoxia induces a differential response in peripheral blood neutrophils and lymphocytes, resulting in neutrophilia and lymphopenia [27] . Hypoxia might be associated with neutrophilia in HBoV-positive patients. However, the precise mechanisms for neutrophilia remain unclear.",
