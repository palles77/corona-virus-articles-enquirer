The impact of disease on laboratory animals and the research these animals represent cannot be overlooked. Large sums of money, time, and effort can be wasted by ini tiating experiments with diseased animals or when animals de velop diseases while on experiment. The loss of breeding pro duction in rodent colonies or loss of the entire colony, which may represent valuable genetic stock, is disruptive to research programs. The outbreaks of mousepox beginning in 1979 in several animal facilities in the United States proved to be ex tremely expensive, not only in dollars but in lost effort and loss of animals (New, 1981) . Likewise, in 1973 and 1974 , out breaks of lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) in research in stitutions affected not only the rodent population but the human population as well (Hinman et al., 1975; Biggar et al., 1977) . Epizootics caused by Sendai virus, the rat coronaviruses (RCV/SDA),* and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) continue to disrupt research though they frequently are over looked or go unreported. Hsu et al. (1980) has summarized much of the data pertaining to the effects of murine viruses on biological systems (see Chapter 23).",

These programs evolved along sim ilar lines in many institutions and commercial firms and have been referred to by a number of terms: animal health monitor ing, disease surveillance, microbiological monitoring, quality assurance, preventive medicine, and animal health sur veillance program. For simplicity throughout the remainder of this chapter the term quality assurance (QA) will be used to refer to health monitoring programs. A QA program is not, in and of itself, a disease prevention program, but rather disease prevention is the result of proper management. As such, a well designed QA program can be a powerful adjunct to managing and maintaining a disease-free animal colony or a colony with a minimal amount of disease. Even in the absence of appropri ate physical facilities to maintain disease-free animals, the health status of animal colonies should be characterized and diseases, if present, should be identified.",

How well a QA program serves an organization is dependent not only on the design and function of the QA program but on how well the management program functions. A critical factor for the success of any animal facility program is that those respon sible for managing the animal facility have responsibility for and control of all animals and animal tissues entering the facili ty. Such control is in the interest of all concerned. Quality assurance begins with defining the microbiological status of the animals or tissues before they enter the research or breed ing colony, not after disease becomes apparent.

The degree of characterization and concern with the microbes identified will vary with the species and the na ture and purpose of the colony, i.e., germfree, defined flora, or conventional and experimental versus breeding. An animal facility should have access to competent assistance for the di agnosis of both infectious diseases and problems not of a mi crobial nature. Ideally, this assistance will be an inhouse diag nostic laboratory staffed by one or more trained professionals offering a full array of pathological, microbiological, and parasitological services. Few organizations have, or can justify, total inhouse diagnostic capabilities, and when additional ser vices are required, use can be made of consultants and com mercial diagnostic laboratories. More important is that neces sary tests be identified and done, results obtained promptly, and the results quickly and correctly interpreted. A theoretical table of organization for a diagnostic laboratory supporting an animal facility is shown in Fig. 1 . Environmental and equip ment monitoring functions of the diagnostic laboratory are de picted as well. While important to the successful operation of an animal facility, they have been covered elsewhere (Newton, 1978; Small, 1983 ; Chapter 17 by Hessler and Moreland) and will not be discussed further in this chapter. Information devel oped by the laboratory is passed rapidly to those responsible for clinical care and management. The exact routing of infor mation and the chain of events that occurs prior to action being taken are not as important as are speed and effective commu nication. Oral communications concerning laboratory results and recommended courses of action should be supported by documented reports. Written documentation of problems is important but should not be stressed to the point that it delays or eliminates communication of problems.",

The use of filter caps (Kraft et al., 1964; Sedlacek et al., 1981) has an effect on the rapidity of spread of aerosalized infections and the use of unidirectional mass airflow (laminar flow) systems (McGarrity and Coriell, 1973) or individually ventilated cages (Cunliffe-Beamer and Les, 1983) may, if used properly, offer significant protection to spread of infection. Reducing the rate of spread may delay the detection of infection, especially in the absence of clinical signs. With agents that spread slowly through a colony, a lower infection rate must be assumed, thus more animals need be tested to achieve the same degree of confidence. Accepting a 30% infection rate as the point of detection as suggested (ILAR, 1976 ) is probably adequate when characterizing an un known colony prior to receiving animals. This assumption should not be construed to mean that an infection rate below 30% is acceptable. Also, in a closed colony, even slow spread ing, persistent agents eventually infect nearly all susceptible animals. When a colony becomes infected, the ideal situation is to detect the infection in the initial cage (index cage) of animals before it spreads to other animals. This is highly im probable as, with some viruses, shedding of virus ceases with or shortly after the appearance of antibody. Further, depending on the animals' genotype, many viruses do not herald their arrival with obvious clinical signs [i.e., pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), mouse encepha litis virus (GDVII), and ectromelia virus] and, in the case of some bacterial infections (i.e., Salmonella spp.), animals may be intermittent shedders in the absence of clinical signs. Clinical signs of infection may appear following stress, i.e., exposure to radiation or corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant drugs. Population biology of infectious diseases has been reviewed May and Anderson, 1979) . Simple statistical analysis has its limitations when de signing a sampling program for an animal production colony. Unlike a room of isolated animals put on experiment at one time and held for an extended period of time (a cohort), the population of a production colony is constantly changing. Aged breeders are being replaced with young animals, and weaned animals are being removed. In the presence of many enzootic infections, it is the recently weaned animal which per petuates the infection. This is exemplified by Sendai pneu monia (Parker and Reynolds, 1968; Fujiware et al., 1976) . There are no hard and fast rules for sampling animals for routine testing. A comprehensive ongoing QA program accu mulates information over time from many small samples. This accumulated information serves as a basis for predicting the colony's health status (Loew and Fox, 1983 ).",

Jacoby and Barthold (1980) recommend examining five male and five female 90-day-old animals of each of two com mon strains twice a year. This examination should be as com-plete as possible, and the vendor should not be alerted that the animals are for monitoring purposes. In addition to animals purchased specifically for surveillance, many tests can be done on animals received for investigators without interfering with the animals use in research. Fecal pellets can be collected from shipping containers and examined for bacteria, such as Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas spp., and parasites. Fecal pellets can also be collected by holding newly arrived animals briefly in clean cages without bedding. In some cases, with approval of the investigator, blood samples can be collected for sero logie or other tests. It is important that the animals monitored come from the same production area(s) that supply the experi mental animals. Commercial producers frequently have more than one room or even more than one production facility pro ducing the same strain or stock. Therefore, it becomes critical to request animals from specific areas when ordering. The ex act source of the animal should be made a part of its permanent record. It is also important to determine if the vendor pools animals in a common stock room from different production rooms or areas prior to shipment. Use of a common stock room is an ideal means for spreading disease and makes monitoring of individual production areas difficult, if not meaningless. However, the health profile of animals that have been in a common stock room for even a short time is probably an ade quate reflection of the health status of all the animals.",

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus is found in wild mice and may cause serious illness and even death in people as well as being a problem in laboratory mice and hamsters (Lehmann-Grube, 1982) . Caution must be exercised and competent advice sought when introducing species with which you are unfamiliar. In addition to LCM, other viruses associated with wild rodents have proved lethal for humans, e.g., Lassa fever virus in Praomys (Mastomys) natalensis (2N = 32); Argentine hemorrhagic fever virus (Junin) in the genera Calomys, Akodon, and Oryzomys; and Machupo virus, the cause of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, in Calomys callosa (Acha and Szyfres, 1980; Casals, 1979) . The group of diseases designated by the confus ing term hemorrhagic fevers, not related to those mentioned above and caused by a variety of different viruses, has recent ly been the subject of considerable attention. The reservoir hosts for these viruses are a number of rodents belonging to the suprafamily Muroidae and the genera Apodemus, Clethrionomys, Microtus, and Rattus. Until recently these vi ruses were considered restricted to Asia and Russia; however, serologie evidence of Hantaan virus, formerly Korean hemor rhagic fever virus, and nephropathia epidemica virus, mem bers of the Bunyaviridae group of viruses, has been found in laboratory rats {Rattus norvegicus) in Japan and Belgium with transmission to people (Anonymous, 1982) . By the indirect immunofluorescent technique, antibody to the Hantaan virus was found in wild Microtus pennsylvanicus and Peromyscus leucopus, but not Mus musculus trapped in Frederick County, Maryland (Lee et al., 1982) . Similarly, antibody was found in 32 of 43 wild Rattus norvegicus trapped in three nonport areas of Baltimore, Maryland (Gibbs et ai, 1982) . Where possible, it is advisable to obtain wild rodents from established experi mental colonies. Even in these cases, the health status must be carefully determined as wild species in contact with estab lished animal colonies can acquire diseases present in the do mestic animals. More important, few colonies of wild rodents have been surgically derived. In addition to viruses, wild ro dents and rabbits frequently have ecto-and endoparasites. They may also harbor pathogenic bacteria, i.e., Salmonella spp., Leptospira spp., Yersinia pestis, Yersinia spp., Campylobacter spp., and Francisella tularensis. These organisms pose a threat to humans and experimental animals alike (see Fox et ai, Chapter 22) .",

Animals used for monitoring may be surplus stock or they may be animals specifically placed in the colony for that purpose. The use of specifically designated monitor animals has the advantage of not interfer ing with valuable breeding stock or animals on experiment. Also, it allows those responsible for surveillance to remove animals at any time if the need arises without consulting inves tigators. Placement of monitors is arbitrary; however, the lower shelves are favored as are cages without filter tops. This combination maximizes the opportunity for the monitors to contact microorganisms. The frequency of monitoring and the number of animals examined each time is a matter of prefer ence. Sample size has been discussed previously; however, Jacoby and Barthold (1980) suggest examining five males and five females, 90 days old and similar groups of aged animals at least twice a year from each area. The placement of females with litters as monitors has also been suggested (Jacoby et al., 1979) . A monitoring plan devised for the Frederick Cancer Research Center of the National Cancer Institute has been de scribed (Hsu et al., 1980) . It is based on the monthly examina tions of animals from all rooms at a confidence limit of 80-90%. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sci ences' mouse and rat colonies are monitored by placing unfiltered cages of four to five female animals in each of four areas of the room among experimental or breeding animals. After 30 to 90 days and then approximately 90 days thereafter, one animal is removed from each cage and sent to the laborato ry for examination. In this scheme, the remaining animals stay in the room until evidence of contamination with organisms incompatible with the needs of the colony are found. After 6-12 months new cages of sentinel animals are established.",

The rationale for housing animals together prior to testing is that if an active infection is present in any one animal, it is likely it will be passed to the others. However, with many of the viruses, i.e., Sendai, PVM, and RCV/SDA, the virus is present for only a short time, and passage of infection ceases following the ap pearance of antibody or shortly thereafter.",

Quarantine programs may be di vided into two major classes: passive and active, based on the testing done during the quarantine period. In a passive quaran tine, animals are merely isolated for a period of time, usually 7 to 28 days (more often the former), and observed for signs of illness or mortality. This form of quarantine will not reveal many infectious agents that rodents and rabbits may carry and is considered inadequate. However, a passive quarantine of 4-6 weeks will allow certain of the nonpersistent murine viral diseases, i.e., Sendai virus pneumonia and RCV/SDA, to run their course. During this period no breeding should take place, or if it does, litters should be destroyed. The animals will de in contrast, an active quarantine is one during which the ani mals or tissues are actively examined for the presence of unde sirable microorganisms. An active quarantine program devel oped originally for mice has been described by Small and New (1981) . Animals and tissues are presumed to be contaminated and are isolated from other animals in the facility. This usually means housing incoming animals or animals inoculated with tissues in plastic isolators (Trexler, 1983) , Illinois cubicles (Lang, 1983) , or Horsfall-Bauer units (Horsfall and Bauer, 1940) (Fig. 3 ). Blood is collected and screened for antibody to the murine viruses appropriate for the species. In addition, ani mals are thoroughly examined for ecto-and endoparasites, pathogenic bacteria, and mycoplasma as appropriate for the species (Tables III-VII) . The specific methods used vary with the diagnostic skills, preferences of the staff, available facili ties, and finances. The individual responsible for the quaran tine program must understand the limitations of the tests used, the nature of the agents being sought, and the consequences of admitting certain organisms to the animal facility. Parker and Collins (1984) have discussed the assays for the murine vi ruses. This publication should be consulted for details of the various procedures and the interpretation of the serologie tests. The current procedures used for testing for murine viruses are rapidly changing with the development of ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) tests for most of the viruses. Kits are commercially available for performing many of the viral assays and testing for Mycoplasma pulmonis. New tests are being developed at a rapid rate. Consultation with experienced ",

These additional animals must come from the same population as those received for experimental or breeding purposes. If ad ditional animals are not available and the experimental animals cannot be bled or otherwise worked with, two to three cohabi tant animals of the same species known to be disease-free, can be added to each of the cages of newly introduced animals for 4 weeks. In the case of mice, use of athymic (nude) mice in conjunction with euthymic mice as cohabitants has merit. However, athymic mice should not be depended on to develop antibody. Females should be used to avoid impregnating the animals received, should they be females. Also, in the case of many strains of mice, less fighting will occur among females than among males. Any litters born to cohabitants can be re moved and euthanatized or used for test purposes. At the end of the cohabitation period, the cohabitant mice are fully char acterized as to their disease status. The basic assumption is that any virus or other infectious agent being shed during this 4week period will be passed to the cohabitant animals and anti body, clinical disease, or the agent (e.g., parasite, bacterium, or mycoplasma) will be detected. Cohabitant animals will not develop antibody to viruses that the quarantined animals had previously and with which they are no longer infected or no longer shedding. In some cases this is not a problem; however, with this procedure the immunologie status of the cohabitants is determined, not that of the newly introduced animals. A statement of the test results should reflect this important point. During the quarantine period, even though the experimental or breeding animals may not be available for collection of blood, they can be examined for ectoparasites, and cellophane tape preparations for Syphacia spp. can be prepared and feces can be examined for parasitic ova and pathogenic bacteria. Three negative cultures of feces at weekly intervals for Salmonella spp. are recommended before declaring animals free of Salmonella spp. Even if the animals being quarantined are examined directly, the use of cohabitants is a useful procedure as they may be euthanatized and their tissues evaluated.",

With living animals, blood is collected and assayed for antibody using appropriate serologie tests. In the case of tumors or tissues, an antibody production test is usually done (Rowe et al., 1962; Collins and Parker, 1972) . The tumor or tissue is frozen and thawed a few times to break the cells and then inoculated into the appropriate host, usually by the intraperitoneal and/or intranasal route. The recipients should be of the same species as the origin of the tumor or tissue or the host through which it has passed or will be passed, i.e., mouse tissue or mouse tumors should be inoculated into mice as should tumors or tissues of other species that have been passed in mice [usually athymic (nude) mice]. In the case of tumors, a nonsyngeneic strain may be used so the tumor does not kill the recipient prior to completion of the test. The usual term for this test procedure is MAP (mouse antibody production) test. If rats are used, it is an RAP (rat antibody production) test, and if hamsters are used, it is an HAP (hamster antibody production) test, etc. After 28 days the recipients are euthanatized, blood is collected, and titers to the appropriate viruses determined. While this procedure was originally reported for detecting anti body to mouse viruses, antibody to Mycoplasma spp. and pos sibly other organisms may also be determined. Positive results with the ELISA test for Mycoplasma pulmonis should be con firmed by culture methods (Lindsey et al., 1982) . Likewise, the recipients may be examined further for the presence of other infectious agents. In addition, tumors and tissues, es pecially tissue cultures, should always be cultured directly for Mycoplasma spp. and other undesirable organisms.",

Lactic dehydrogenase virus is detected by measuring an increase in the level of LDH enzyme compared to control values following the inoculation of blood or other tissues into mice. The complement fixation test for LCM virus is not par ticularly sensitive; therefore mice are frequently inoculated with blood. The recent introduction of an ELISA test for LCM will reduce the need for mouse inoculation. Both of these tests are discussed by Parker and Collins (1984) . Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can cause serious disease in people and appropriate containment facilities and techniques must be used (see Fox et al., Chapter 22) .",

            "text": "Animal health surveillance needs to be an integral part of any biomedicai research program. Continued assurance of the quality of the animals used in a research project is fundamental to the integrity of the final research results. At the same time it must be understood that QA programs are evolving as new diseases are identified and the role of old diseases is more clearly defined and understood. The knowledge gained in re cent years concerning the epizootiology of Sendai virus pneu monia (Parker and Richter, 1982) and the rat coronaviruses (Jacoby et al., 1979) has been helpful in dealing with these troublesome diseases. Recent information concerning MHV suggests that this virus is not as persistent as previously thought (Barthold and Smith, 1983) . Thus, means for dealing with this disease are suggested. Recent advances in test pro cedures for infectious agents, especially the ELISA test, have raised the precision of diagnoses to new levels. New ELISA tests for many of the organisms affecting rodents and rabbits are being developed at this time. The rapid detection of anti body to Pasteurella multocida in rabbits with the ELISA tech nique is a step forward in identifying carriers or potential car riers (Peter et al., 1983; Matsumoto et al, 1983) . The occurrence of Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare in a colony of mice (Waggie et al., 1983) and the recent recognition of Campylobacter fetus subspecies jejuni as a potential pathogen for hamsters and other laboratory animals (Fox, 1982; La Re gina and Lonigro, 1982) are of considerable interest. The find ing of coronavirus-like particles in rabbits with diarrhea (Lapierre et al., 1980) and the identification of coronaviruslike particles in the serum of rabbits with cardiomyopathy, also known as pleural effusion disease (Small et al., 1979; Osterhaus et al., 1982) lengthens the list of diseases for this spe cies. The recent association of a gliding bacillus with chronic respiratory disease of rats is of interest (Ganaway et al., 1983) .",
