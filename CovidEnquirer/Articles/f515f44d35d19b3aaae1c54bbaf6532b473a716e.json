Total RNA was extracted from faecal suspensions and FCoV RNA was quantified using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The real-time RT-PCR threshold cycle (C T ) values were consistently high suggesting that the samples contained very little viral RNA. However, experiments in which RNA extracted from FCoV-infected cell culture supernatants was combined with RNA extracted from faecal suspensions revealed the presence of faecal factors that significantly inhibited the reverse transcription reaction. Consequently, three methods of RNA extraction were investigated and RNA dilution was undertaken to investigate whether the effects of the faecal inhibitors could be reduced. Our results show that using the QIAgen RNA mini kit for RNA extraction and dilution of the RNA samples helps to reduce the inhibitory effects. However, because the extent of the inhibitory effects varied between faecal samples, accurate quantification proved difficult. We, therefore, conclude that although real-time RT-PCR provides an excellent method for detecting the presence of viral shedding, quantification of FCoV RNA in faecal material has to take into account the possible effects of RT-PCR inhibitors. It is, therefore, essential that all new assays, and the methods of sample preparation, are carefully evaluated before being used in a clinical setting. Date",

Natural infections with FCoV are usually transient, although a significant percentage of infections may become persistent (Addie and Jarrett 2001) . Most infections are asymptomatic or result in mild, self-limiting gastrointestinal disease. However, in a small percentage of animals, a fatal multi-systemic, immune-mediated disease known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) occurs (Pedersen 1995) .

Cats recovering from coronavirus infection will shed virus in their faeces and are a potential risk to other susceptible cats. Most cats will shed virus for a period of a few weeks to months either continuously or transiently (Addie and Jarrett 2001, Lutz et al 2002b) . Occasionally persistent carriers are found which will shed virus indefinitely (Addie and Jarrett 2001) . In multicat households a large proportion of cats (75e100%) will be shedding coronavirus at any given time (Pedersen 1995) . Each individual cat will undergo cycles of infection, shedding, recovery and re-infection (Foley et al 1997a) . Close contact between infected and susceptible cats facilitates the most effective transmission and is important in the recirculation of virus allowing maintenance of endemic infection. However, coronavirus can persist in the environment for 3e7 weeks (Hoskins 1993) and the risk of transmission via fomites also exists. There is no known vertical transmission of the virus.",

            "text": "At the present time there are no effective treatments available for cats with FIP and the disease is invariably fatal. This means that, currently, controls to prevent FCoV infection are the most effective method for controlling FIP disease. A number of control strategies have been used based on either elimination or minimisation of infection. Environmental controls are the most widely used tool and good hygiene techniques are essential. Coronaviruses are inactivated by most household detergents (Maris 1990 ), but appropriate cattery design is required to facilitate effective disinfection and this is a major drawback in many 'household breeding' situations. Keeping small group sizes (not more than five cats housed together), reducing levels of intercurrent disease and minimising stress levels will also reduce the incidence of FIP (Addie and Jarrett 1992) . Isolation and early weaning protocols may also be beneficial to reduce the exposure of young kittens that are at high risk of infection. For multi-cat households with endemic FCoV infection separation of cats within the household according to their level of faecal shedding has been advocated to help to accelerate the rate of viral load reduction (Foley et al 1997a , Addie and Jarrett 2001 , Lutz et al 2002b . This strategy requires frequent monitoring of FCoV in faecal samples. Viral particles remain stable in faeces for at least 10 days and faecal shedding can be assessed using reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays to detect the viral genome (Lutz et al 2002b) . Recently, quantitative real-time RT-PCR methods have become available enabling the amount, as well as the frequency, of virus shedding to be assessed (Gut et al 1999) . This could potentially be a useful tool as high-level shedders pose a greater threat of disease transmission (Foley et al 1997b) . Using this approach, a recent study showed that the majority of cats (78%) were 'low-level' shedders with shedding frequencies of less than 30%. Approximately 20% of the cats were termed medium-level shedders with shedding frequencies of 30e90% and only 1% of the cats were highlevel shedders with shedding frequencies exceeding 90% (Lutz et al 2002a) . Taking four faecal samples over a 3-week period has been suggested to give a good indication of viral load (Lutz et al 2002b) .",

Subsequently, 'quantification graphs' (fluorescence vs cycle number) were used to compare threshold cycle (C T ) values using a standard fluorescence threshold of 100 rfu. Confirmation of reaction efficiencies for use of the assay with field strain virus was not possible due to low C T values precluding the use of serial dilutions. However, any reduction in the RT-PCR reaction efficiency using field strain RNA template would most likely result from nucleotide discrepancies within the PCR primer annealing sites. The P009, P010 and Taqman probe annealing sites on the RNA from several of the clinical FCoV strains were sequenced to check for primer mismatches. This revealed good sequence conservation with a maximum of two nucleotide mismatches per oligonucleotide (data not shown). Further investigation revealed that small reductions in RT-PCR reaction efficiency resulting from these primer mismatches could be eliminated by reducing the PCR annealing temperature from 59 to 56 C.",

At the 1:8 and 1:16 dilutions the C T values rose steadily suggesting that further dilution was of no benefit. A 7-cycle improvement in the C T value was seen at the 1:4 dilution which equates to an increase in the apparent initial virus concentration by a factor of w130 (2 7 ).

            "text": "The results of our study show that the quantification of FCoV RNA from faecal samples of domestic cats using real-time RT-PCR is problematic because of the presence of enzyme inhibitors. A series of 'spiking' experiments showed that this inhibition was a significant problem only for the reverse transcription reaction and not for the PCR amplification step. This finding could reflect the relative amounts of faecalderived material in the two reactions (50% of the RT reaction volume are derived from faecal RNA compared with only 2% of the PCR reaction) or it may reflect the specific inhibition of an enzyme activity. The effect of these inhibitors was minimised by the use of the QIAgen viral RNA mini kit for RNA extraction and by dilution of RNA samples prior to reverse transcription. A 1:4 RNA dilution could be used empirically to ensure that false negative RT-PCR results were minimised. However, as our preliminary results have shown that faecal samples contained variable inhibitor concentrations, we believe that quantitative assessment of faecal viral RNA content using this method may often be inaccurate. Given the profound effects of faecal inhibitors found in this study it may be that some cats designated as low level shedders using similar assays could actually be shedding virus at much higher levels. Such results could have significant clinical relevance if used as part of screening programmes within households attempting to reduce viral loads. The results of this study are in broad agreement with those of many other authors who have experienced problems amplifying nucleic acid from faecal material. For example, a recent study evaluating eight methods for extracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) RNA from faecal material concluded that the majority retained inhibitory substances preventing optimal amplification (Petrich et al 2006) . However, several previously published studies quantifying FCoV faecal shedding using real-time RT-PCR have not reported significant problems associated with faecal inhibitors. It is possible that this problem has not been specifically addressed previously and that faecal shedding of FCoV may, therefore, have been commonly underestimated. However, it is also possible that alternative protocols may succeed in satisfactorily overcoming the problem. For example, in this study we only investigated the use of one reverse transcriptase enzyme (Superscript II RNAse H \u00c0 ) and it is possible that other RT enzymes may be less sensitive to the effects of inhibitors. Nevertheless, our results suggest that internal positive RT-PCR controls should be included in future assays and that the potential for variable levels of inhibitory factors in faecal samples should be kept in mind. Performing multiple assays using various RNA dilutions may also be of benefit. The conclusion is, therefore, not that accurate quantification of FCoV RNA in faeces is impossible but that each individual assay should be carefully evaluated before it is used in a clinical setting. The results are expressed as threshold cycle (C T ) values and duplicate results are shown as run 1 and run 2. Negative results are represented as (\u00c0).",
