Although antibodies to T. gondii are widely prevalent in many species of felids, including the domestic cat, clinical toxoplasmosis is rare in wild felids (Dubey, 2009; Jones and Dubey, 2010) . However, toxoplasmosis causes severe illness in Pallas cats (Felis manul), and the parasite can be transmitted transplacentally from asymptomatic mothers to kittens (Kenny et al., 2002; Basso et al., 2005; Dubey, 2009) . Recently, a similar phenomenon was described for Sand cats (Felis margarita) from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Pas and Dubey, 2008a) .",

At the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife (BCEAW), the Sand cats are kept in large outside enclosures with an inner den.

In the present paper we report additional cases of fatal toxoplasmosis in Sand cats in UAE and the State of Qatar, and genetically characterize T. gondii isolates from these cats for the first time from this host. We also document prevalence of T. gondii antibodies in several other species of animals from the UAE and Qatar. (Pas and Dubey, 2008a) . The kittens were weighed and examined twice a week in an attempt to detect disease in the early stages. They were developing normally until day 26, when FM016 died of acute toxoplasmosis (Pas and Dubey, 2008a) . The surviving kitten, FM017, had a MAT titer of >3200 and was medicated with clindamycin (Dalacin C TM , Pharmacia, Puurs, Belgium) for 15 weeks at a dosage of 20 mg/kg given orally with a syringe. Once the kitten started eating solid food the clindamycin powder was disguised in liquid fat on the food. The animal developed no clinical signs during this period but at the age of 1 year however, it was observed to walk into objects and a severe bilateral mydriasis was seen. Direct and indirect pupil reflexes were negative and ophthalmological examination revealed a partial degeneration of the retina. Blood samples excluded infections with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or Bartonella sp. Further differentials for retinal degeneration included taurine deficiency and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) but no further indications could support these etiologies. Over several months the animal showed an increasing muscle atrophy of the hind legs and became ataxic. A general examination under anesthesia did not reveal any obvious cause for the problems seen. Liver values AST and ALT were slightly increased as well as bile acids (AST 78.9 U/l, ALT 144.5 U/l, and bile acids 35.98 mol/l). The animal was treated several times with vitamin B complex (B.Complex-C, Bio-Pharmachemie Co. Ltd., Vietnam) and anabolica (Ilium Boldebal-H, Troy laboratories PTY Limited, Australia) injections and de-wormed regularly. At the age of 3 years, she became incontinent. Hematuria and high alkalinity was seen and many crystals were found in the urine sediment. After 2 weeks of treatment with marbofloxacine injected and later given orally at a dosage of 2 mg/kg (Marbocyl 2% and Marbocyl 20 mg tablets, Vetoquinol, B.V.'s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands) there was no improvement and since the ataxia and general condition of the animal had already deteriorated for such a long time, the cat was euthanized. Samples of frozen liver and lungs were sent to the Animal Parasitic Diseases Laboratory (APDL), Beltsville, MD for further evaluation.",

            "text": "2.1.1.2. FM019 and FM020. On 12 March 2009 two new Sand cats, a 1-year-old male FM019 and a 2-year-old female FM020, were acquired from a nearby collection where they had been born in captivity. The animals were quarantined at the BCEAW for 6 weeks during which they were observed for signs of illness and examined once under anesthesia. Hematologic and biochemical evaluations were done at that time but no abnormal blood values were seen, and viral testing for FeLV and FIV (SensPERT kits, Combined FeLV Antigen/FIV antibody test, Vet All Laboratories, Korea) were negative. They were also seronegative for T. gondii antibodies (see serology section) on blood samples drawn on 4 April 2009. After their quarantine period, the animals were moved to a display enclosure in the zoo. In this enclosure Gordon's wildcats of which several had antibodies to T. gondii (Pas and Dubey, 2008b) had previously been housed. Shortly after it was noticed that the female FM020 was not eating well, but this was attributed to the rather low temperatures in the cage, which is regulated with air-conditioning. The animal received a general examination and blood was collected under sedation with medetomidine (0.05 mg/kg, Domitor, Orion Pharma, Finland). Liver enzymes ALT and AST were slightly increased (AST 110.2 U/l and ALT 144.2 U/l) as well as urea (19 mmol/l) but with a normal creatinine (60 mol/l). All other hematology and biochemistry val- ues tested were in normal range. No further abnormalities could be detected during examination and her weight was as expected. Radiographs of the thorax and abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities either. Apart from some subcutaneous fluid during the procedure, no other treatment was indicated and since it was thought that the low temperature might have been the reason for the inappetance, only environmental changes were made. This cat is now apparently healthy. A blood sample was obtained from cat FM020 on 15 July 2009 for T. gondii antibodies. Four weeks later her male cage mate FM019 looked depressed and ate less than normal. He was hand caught to perform an examination but during normal restraint and handling to take radiographs he developed a severe dyspnoea, collapsed and died on 15 June 2009. A necropsy was performed on the same day.",

In 2006 a blood sample was taken and the T. gondii antibody titer was determined with a latex agglutination test at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, using a commercial kit (Eiken, Tokyo, Japan), which showed a positive titer of >512. Testing for FIV, FeLV and FeCoV were negative at that time. In 2007 he started to show signs of ataxia in the hind legs and a slight head tilt. A full examination under sedation revealed no obvious abnormalities but hematology results revealed a severe increase in globulins (80 g/l) and proteinuria. Because of previous problems in the Sand cats with toxoplasmosis infection, the animal was started on clindamycin (Dalacin C TM , Pharmacia, Puurs, Belgium) at 20 mg/kg twice daily for 32 days. Clinical signs improved slowly but the animal never completely recovered and remained slightly ataxic. Behavioural changes indicated that he also might have had impaired vision and a full ophthalmological examination was performed which revealed an inactive chorioretinitis with partial degeneration of the retina.",

We are not aware of previous reports of serological prevalence in the long eared hedgehog (Hemiechinus auritus), white tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda), Indian grey mongoose (Herpestes edwardsii), Hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas) and the Arabian wolf (Canis lupus arabs). Sobrino et al. (2008) reported T. gondii antibodies in 59.1% of 22 Egyptian mongoose (Herpestis ichneumon) from Spain. Pas and Dubey (2008b) found MAT antibodies in 86.1% of 36 Gordon's wild cat from the BCEAW. In the present study, T. gondii antibodies were found in 5 of 5 Gordon's wild cat. Whether Sand cat, Gordon's wild cat, caracal, or leopard can excrete T. gondii oocysts is unknown (Dubey, 2009) , whereas it is known that cheetahs can excrete T. gondii oocysts (Marchiondo et al., 1976; Polomoshnov, 1979) . There are several Gordon's wild cats resident at the BCEAW. They were housed in the same pen 2 months before the Sand cats FM019 and FM020 were introduced in the enclosure. Oocysts excreted by these cats might have been present in the pen where the Sand cats were housed and could be the source of infection for Sand cats at BCEAW.",

This genotype was previously reported in T. gondii isolates of dogs from Sri Lanka (Dubey et al., 2007) , indicating it is widely spread in Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. In addition, the strain identified from Sand cat from Qatar belongs to the Type II lineage that is also widely spread at the global scale. The high seropositivity of T. gondii in captive wild animals tested in this study, in addition with the lack of epidemiological studies on this parasite in the Persian Gulf region, makes it necessary to carry out further studies to investigate the diversity and transmission of T. gondii in animal and populations in the region.",
