In addition, treating potential pandemic viral strains is problematic because of the many unknowns about the pathogenesis of infection. Current anti-viral drugs, which target a pathogen's enzymatic functions and provide a ''one-bug-one-drug'' approach, use resources inefficiently and are often limited by the emergence of viral resistance (Locarnini and Warner, 2007; Richman et al., 2004) . The drug-development process requires the ability to identify specific host factors that are necessary for viral growth and virulence that could also be potential drug targets. In light of the large unmet need for novel antiviral strategies, an efficient solution would be to repurpose currently approved drugs as broad-spectrum, host-centered antivirals that could impair viral transmission and prevent clinical pathology by identifying host factors that are targeted by existing drugs and are required for viral growth.",

We refer to each study (unique GSE ID) in GEO as a dataset and a set of samples for each comparison within a dataset as a cohort. Unlike a singlecohort experiment, where the goal is to control as many confounding factors as possible, we included broad biological and technical heterogeneity, such as treatment protocols and demographics, observed in the population by choosing discovery cohorts that were collected at different centers (with different treatment protocols and demographics) and that profiled more than one viral infection (influenza, RSV, HRV) across different age groups (infant and pediatric). We incorporated technical heterogeneity in our samples by choosing datasets that were profiled using microarrays from two different manufacturers and represented different technological confounding factors (e.g., length of oligonucleotide probes, sample preparation protocols). In order to avoid the potential influence of a single cohort on the results due to unequal sample sizes or other unknown confounding factors among cohorts, we performed a ''leave-one-cohort-out'' analysis. We hypothesized that the resulting set of genes that were significantly differentially expressed, irrespective of the set of cohorts analyzed, would constitute a robust signature of respiratory viral infection.",

As expected, the MVS scores in virus-infected children were significantly higher than those in virus-negative controls (p = 6.88 3 10 \u00c07 ; receiver operating characteristic [ROC] area under the curve [AUC] = 1). The MVS scores were significantly higher in afebrile RSV-infected children than in those with febrile bacterial infections (p = 6.21 3 10 \u00c04 ) and distinguished both groups with high accuracy (ROC AUC = 0.98) (Figures 2A and S1A ).

Interestingly, in GSE40396, the MVS scores were also higher for children with other viral infections (adenovirus, HHV6, and enterovirus) compared to virus-negative controls (p = 1.02 3 10 \u00c08 ) and those with bacterial infections (p = 0.012), although none of these infections were used to define the MVS ( Figure S1C ). The MVS scores also distinguished samples with these viral infections from those with bacterial infections and samples from healthy controls with relatively high accuracy ( Figure S1D ). This indicates that the MVS might be more broadly applicable than respiratory viruses. Next, we used an influenza challenge study (GSE: GSE52428), which inoculated healthy adults with H3N2 or H1N1 to evaluate changes in the MVS scores over the course of infection (Woods et al., 2013) . The MVS scores remained unchanged over time in asymptomatic subjects that were not shedding any virus in both groups. However, the MVS scores increased significantly for virus-shedding symptomatic subjects over 24-72 hr and began to decline toward asymptomatic baseline levels as symptoms resolved ( Figures 2C, 2D , S1E, and S1G). Specifically, the MVS scores for six of the nine H3N2 symptomatic volunteers (67%) were higher than those of the H3N2 asymptomatic volunteers at 36 hr after inoculation ( Figure 2C ). Similarly, the MVS scores for 9 of the 12 H1N1 symptomatic volunteers (75%) were higher than those of the H1N1 asymptomatic volunteers at 53 hr after inoculation ( Figure 2D ). The median onset time of symptoms for H3N2-and H1N1-inoculated volunteers was 49.3 hr (range 24-84 hr) and 61.3 hr (range 24-108 hr), respectively. Hence, the increase in the MVS scores preceded respiratory infection symptom onset in both strains and distinguished H3N2 and H1N1 symptomatic from asymptomatic volunteers with high specificity and sensitivity with ROC AUC for H3N2 and H1N1 of 0.94 at 36 hr (p = 0.009) and 0.84 at 53 hr (p = 0.008), respectively (Figures S1F and S1H).",

For H1N1 volunteers, who showed symptoms later than the H3N2 group (Woods et al., 2013) , the IMS score also began to increase at a later time point as compared to the H3N2 group, achieving maximum discrimination between symptomatic and asymptomatic volunteers at 60 hr (AUC = 0.9; Figure S4B ), which was also prior to symptom onset in all H1N1 volunteers. Thus, the kinetics of IMS gene expression might provide prognostic capability in the clinic for tracking potential morbidity after a known exposure by identifying susceptible individuals prior to symptom onset.",

(2014) , typically vaccine responders and non-responders are defined based on 4-fold change in hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay titers 28 days after vaccination. Therefore, we used this definition to categorize responders and non-responders in two independent vaccination cohorts (GSE: GSE48018 and GSE48023 from Franco et al., 2013) and explored whether the IMS scores showed difference between vaccine responders and non-responders prior to the 28-day mark. In a cohort of 128 females (GSE48023), the IMS scores increased significantly on day 3 after vaccination in responders for H1N1 (paired t test p = 0.002) and H3N2 (paired t test p = 0.015), but not in non-responders (paired t test p > 0.2) ( Figures   7B and 7C) . Similarly, in a cohort of 119 males (GSE48018), the IMS scores increased significantly in responders for H1N1 and H3N2 (paired t test p < 2.2 3 10 \u00c016 ) on day 1 after vaccination for both H1N1 and H3N2 ( Figures 7D and 7E) . However, the IMS scores also increased significantly in non-responders (paired t test p < 0.01) for H1N1 and H3N2 in the male cohort, although the increase in the non-responders after vaccination was lower than the responders (Figures 7D and 7E ). When we used 4-fold increase in the microneutralization titers on 28 days after vaccination to define responders, the IMS scores showed similar results for both cohorts ( Figure S5 ). These results show that the IMS score increases significantly in vaccine responders and could potentially serve as a marker for successful vaccination.",

However, the magnitude of the change in the average IMS score at 18 hr after infection was higher for cells exposed to influenza viral RNA, infected with PR8 influenza virus lacking NS1 protein, or treated with IFN-b and is probably due to the absence of the NS1 protein that inhibits vRNA-or IFN-b-induced pathways in each of these conditions. Furthermore, the increase in the IMS score was fastest in cells treated with IFN-b (1.5 hr), slowest for infection with wild-type PR8 influenza virus with or without NS1 protein (6 hr), and intermediate for transfection with only viral RNA (4 hr). Taken together, these differences in the timing of when the average IMS score begins to rise suggests that the IMS consists of host response genes that are directly or indirectly targeted by the influenza virus to suppress the host response, evade detection, and dampen the effects of IFN-b.",

Our results showed that the MVS is able to (1) distinguish virus-infected patients from those with bacterial infections or healthy controls with high accuracy and (2) identify influenzainfected subjects at risk for being ill before onset of clinical symptoms. Although the clinical utility of the MVS might be limited due to the large number of genes in the signature, it provides a potential starting point for simpler diagnostic gene sets. Importantly, it has identified novel pathways to better understand viral host response and identify targets for novel anti-viral therapies. We also showed that the IMS (1) is specific to influenza infection, (2) is able to distinguish influenza infection from bacterial infections, (3) is predictive of clinical illness in challenge studies, (4) is prognostic in influenza pneumonia patients, (5) is correlated with gene expression changes in subjects responding to influenza vaccination, and (6) showed different dynamics in males and females after influenza vaccination.",

For instance, although the total number of genes reported by these studies ranged from 25 to 615, none of the IMS genes were reported by all studies. For example, the most reported gene, MX1, was reported as being overexpressed by only seven datasets, whereas CD38 was reported as overexpressed by only one dataset. These observed discrepancies in the reported results of influenza infection across multiple studies also underscore the importance and advantage of using our rigorous integrated multi-cohort analysis approach. It enables the researchers to leverage the large amounts of publicly available datasets and the biological and technological heterogeneity present among them to create ''Big Data'' from multiple ''Small Data'' that are better representative of the heterogeneity observed in the realworld population. This approach has been previously found to be effective at uncovering genes with consistent expression profiles that are mechanistic, diagnostic, and therapeutic (Chen et al., 2014; Khatri et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015; Mazur et al., 2014; Sweeney et al., 2015) .",

            "text": "Compelling clinical data have shown that men and women differ in their innate, humoral, and cell-mediated response to viral vaccines (Klein et al., 2010) . For example, testosterone can have immunosuppressive role in response to influenza vaccination (Furman et al., 2014) . In line with this, the IMS scores changed significantly in responders on day 1 for males and on day 3 for females after vaccination. These results suggest that the effect of sex differences on immune response might be more nuanced in that males respond sooner to vaccination compared to females and that sex differences might also have an effect on the dynamics of an immune response, not just its magnitude. These results further suggest that future vaccination studies should be designed to sample subjects more frequently in the first 3 days after vaccination to further understand sex differences in immune response after vaccination. Jenner and Young (2005) previously carried out an analysis of 785 samples in 32 studies. However, contrary to our integrated multi-cohort analysis, which focused on identifying a robust signature of viral infection, their analysis focused on identifying a common transcriptional response to pathogenic infections irrespective of source (bacterial or viral). Furthermore, their analysis relied on a clustering of gene expression patterns across all studies to identify a ''common host response'' of 511 genes, where these genes were not ubiquitously expressed across all datasets. Instead, we employed an established statistical framework to account for the variability of gene expression, array types, and the number of samples within each study. In addition, all samples used in our analysis for the identification of MVS and IMS were peripheral blood samples, whereas Jenner and Young (2005) used samples from various sources including cell lines, sorted immune cells, and other tissues (liver, skin, astrocytes, fibroblasts, etc.) . Because of these important differences in study design, many genes identified by Jenner and Young (2005) as those mediating inflammation were not significantly differentially expressed in our analysis, because they are probably overexpressed during both bacterial and viral infections compared to uninfected individuals. However, a number of the IFN-inducible genes they identified were also overexpressed in our analysis, suggesting that although these genes are overexpressed during bacterial and viral infections, they have greater changes in their expression after influenza infection than bacterial infections.",

Thus, it has remained unclear which of these genes were most relevant to influenza infection. Herein we identified a concise influenza response signature with many ISGs. Indeed, IFN-b treatment of HBECs suggests that some or all of the genes in the IMS are stimulated by IFN. This finding indicates that whereas ISGs are a common element among signatures, a concise and specific gene subset features most importantly in response to influenza.",

However, not all IMS genes were overexpressed in these in vitro studies. For example, as expected, CD38 was not differentially expressed, since its expression is specific to lymphocytes (Moreno-Garc\u00eda et al., 2005; Sandoval-Montes and Santos-Argumedo, 2005) . These results suggest that the IMS response to influenza infection is present in both circulating blood and in separate tissue types. This paper has some limitations. First, the MVS gene set might include too many genes to allow for a simple clinical test; further optimization might be needed before reduction to practice. Second, the IMS signature was specific to influenza against the other viral infections for which data were available, but there are other clinical infections similar to influenza infection (i.e., parainfluenza infection) that would need further testing. Finally, prospective testing will be needed for both gene sets.",

First, the MVS could serve as a starting point to identify broad host factor targets for developing broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs. Most of the existing anti-viral drugs are based on the one-drug-one-bug philosophy, which is inefficient and ineffective because viruses often mutate to develop drug resistance and novel viral strains can emerge from animal carriers. Instead, developing anti-viral drugs that target host factors involved in multiple respiratory viral infections could provide protection against a broader group of viruses and be more effective against novel strains. Second, the IMS score can be used clinically to distinguish influenza infections, regardless of whether there is concurrent bacterial pneumonia, which could help clinicians to determine whether to initiate antiviral treatments in patients with potential co-infections. Third, the IMS score can be used as a more objective measure of a vaccination response. Our results in influenza-vaccinated individuals show that the IMS score increases significantly in responders but remains unchanged in non-responders.",
