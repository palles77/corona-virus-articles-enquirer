These included surfaces within hospitals where Nipah virus patients received care, surfaces within homes of confi rmed case-patients, trees where bats foraged, date palm sap collection pots, and fruits that may have been in contact with fruit bats. Surfaces were rolled with sterile, cotton-tipped applicators, which were stored in 500 \u03bcL Dulbecco modifi ed Eagle medium supplemented with an antibiotic-antimycotic solution. Viral RNA was extracted from 140 \u03bcL of the resulting suspension by using a Viral RNA Minikit (QIAGEN, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and eluted in a volume of 50 \u03bcL.

Our fi ndings are also limited by recall bias. Family and friends were often asked to provide information about a deceased patient weeks after their illness (data for 5 patients were collected >1 month after illness onset). When possible, medical records were used to supplement patient reports of illness history, but often these records were incomplete or nonexistent. However, the investigation began just days after onset of illness in most patients, which provided for optimal recall of events. In addition, case-patients or their proxies might have more carefully considered their exposures than controls. However, all community members were aware of, and concerned by, the outbreak, and we believe it is unlikely that any control did not remember their exposure to case-patients in their community.",
