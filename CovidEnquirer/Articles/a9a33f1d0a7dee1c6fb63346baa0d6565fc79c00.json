Their expression is upregulated following stress and viral infection, and they associate with the SRP9/14 protein dimer in the cytoplasm forming Alu RNPs. Using cell-free translation, we have previously shown that Alu RNPs inhibit polysome formation. Here, we describe the mechanism of Alu RNP-mediated inhibition of translation initiation and demonstrate its effect on translation of cellular and viral RNAs. Both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated initiation is inhibited. Inhibition involves direct binding of SRP9/14 to 40S ribosomal subunits and requires Alu RNA as an assembly factor but its continuous association with 40S subunits is not required for inhibition. Binding of SRP9/14 to 40S prevents 48S complex formation by interfering with the recruitment of mRNA to 40S subunits. In cells, overexpression of Alu RNA decreases translation of reporter mRNAs and this effect is alleviated with a mutation that reduces its affinity for SRP9/14. Alu RNPs also inhibit the translation of cellular mR-NAs resuming translation after stress and of viral mRNAs suggesting a role of Alu RNPs in adapting the translational output in response to stress and viral infection.",

The modern Alu element is composed of two similar, but not identical monomers named the left arm and the right arm ( Figure 1A ). Based on mutations at diagnostic positions, Alu elements are divided into three families of different evolutionary ages (8) . The most ancient family is named AluJ followed by AluS and AluY. Alu elements can be part of a polymerase II transcription unit and are therefore present in pre-mRNAs and mRNAs. These embedded Alu sequences can influence gene expression in many ways for example by providing alternative splice sites as well as target sites of miRNAs and editing enzymes (6) . Alu elements can also be transcribed by RNA polymerase III into the noncoding dimeric Alu RNA (7) , and under normal physiological conditions their expression is thought to be repressed by various cis-and trans-acting factors (8) most likely to keep retrotransposition events at low levels. However, their abundance is increased about 10-fold and higher in response to heat shock and viral infection (6) . Relatively little is known about cellular functions of Alu RNA. It has been shown to inhibit pol. II-dependent transcription, and its inhibitory activity was assigned to the right arm (9) .",

Our studies demonstrate that Alu RNPs interfere with the formation of the 48S complex by a novel mechanism in which Alu RNPs act directly on the 40S ribosomal subunit to prevent its association with the mRNA. Moreover, the SRP9/14 protein dimer constitutes the inhibitory component, which has to be transferred to 40S by the Alu RNA. This mechanism efficiently inhibits cap-dependent as well as IRES-mediated translation initiation. Overexpression of Alu RNA in HEK 293T cells inhibits in an SRP9/14-dependent fashion translation of mR-NAs that initiate protein synthesis de novo. Our results are consistent with a physiological role of Alu RNPs in the translational response to viral infection and stress.",

In the reconstituted mammalian system, the inhibition was maximal at 5-fold higher particle concentration (500 nM) than in RRL (100 nM), which we attributed to absolute and relative differences in the abundances of active ribosomes and initiation factors as compared to RRL. Moreover, a fraction of the Alu particles might be inactivated by nonspecific binding to components present at elevated and imbalanced concentrations in the reconstituted system. Figure S3A , Table 1 ). Furthermore, we produced AluY RNAs representing the different subfamilies of the genomic AluY elements to generalize our findings on AluY RNPs (Table 1 , Supplementary Figure S3C ). Particles were purified and analyzed as before and their RNA and protein contents were consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry of the complexes (Supplementary Figure S3E ). The effect of the AluY L and SA110 RNPs on translation efficiency was monitored at different concentrations in the pPL-primed RRL.

In contrast, the SA110 RNP had no effect at all concentrations tested.

To investigate whether the cap structure and the 5 UTR affect the inhibitory activity of Alu RNPs, we generated reporter constructs in which the Firefly luciferase coding sequence (Fluc) was fused to the 5 UTRs of the \u2424-globin (\u2424-glo), \u2424-actin (\u2424-act) and LINE-1 (L1) mRNAs. The \u2424-glo and \u2424-act mRNAs have relatively short 5 UTRs (53 and 84 nucleotides, respectively) while the L1 5 UTR is GC-rich and 900 nucleotides in length. Uncapped and capped transcripts of the three reporter con- structs were translated in RRL in the presence of AluY A and scAluY A RNPs. Translation efficiencies were not significantly different between the capped and uncapped transcripts and between the reporter mRNAs comprising different 5 UTRs ( Figure 4A ).

Remarkably, the scAluY A RNA migrated exclusively in the top fractions consistent with the notion that the 40S-bound h9/14 was dissociated from the Alu RNA. In contrast, free h9/14 bound quantitatively and nonselectively to both the 40S and the 60S subunits (Figure 5B) . We next examined the binding of the scAluY A RNP and h9/14 to 80S ribosomes. To this end, 80S ribosomes were allowed to associate from high salt purified 40S and 60S subunits for 10 min before the addition of the Alu RNP or h9/14. Only a fraction of the subunits assembled into 80S ribosomes in the presence of 1.5 mM magnesium acetate and individual subunits were therefore still present. Upon the addition scAluY A RNP we found h9/14 to be exclusively associated with 40S subunits whereas in the absence of the Alu RNA the protein bound nonselectively and was equally distributed between 40S and 60S containing fractions ( Figure 5C ). Hence, the presence of the Alu RNA appears to confer binding specificity to h9/14. This is further supported by the fact that all h9/14 bound quantitatively Nucleic Acids Research, 2015 , Vol. 43, No. 5 2883 to 40S subunits even when present in a 2-fold molar excess over 40S indicating that it has more than one binding site on the 40S subunit (Supplementary Figure S6) . In contrast the presence of 2-fold molar excess of scAluY A RNP over 40S did not increase the amount of the 40S-bound h9/14 suggesting that in this case the binding is saturable and occurs most likely to one specific site on the ribosome.",

If indeed the continuous association of the Alu RNA were not required to inactivate the 40S subunit, the released RNA might serve in another round of targeted delivery of free SRP9/14 to 40S. To assess this hypothesis, we supplemented the RRL translation reaction containing scAluY A RNP with an equal amount or a 2-fold excess of h9/14. The presence of excess h9/14 significantly enhanced the inhibitory activity of the scAluY A RNP, while the protein alone at the same concentrations had no effect on translation ( Figure 5F, left panel) . Hence, the Alu RNA is not part of the inactive 40S complex.",

An equal amount or a 2-fold excess of the scAluY A RNA over the scAluY A RNP attenuated the inhibition ( Figure 5F , middle panel). These results are consistent with the mutually exclusive and reversible binding of SRP9/14 to either the Alu RNA or to a functionally important site in the 40S subunit. The competition between 40S and Alu RNA may also explain why the inhibitory effect of Alu RNPs saturated at around 50% ( Figure 1B and F) . The targeted transfer of SRP9/14 from the Alu RNP to 40S leads to the release of free RNA and to the concomitant decrease in the amount of 40S subunits available for SRP9/14 binding. Saturation is reached when 40S subunits are no longer able to compete with the Alu RNA for SRP9/14 binding.",

Both Alu RNPs were incubated individually with 40S subunits and the complexes analyzed by sucrose gradients ( Figure 5E ). As observed in similar experiments with the protein alone (24), h9/14A5 was absent from the 40S fractions whereas h9-3A/14 bound as efficiently as the wild type protein to 40S subunits. These results indicated that SRP9/14 binding to the 40S subunit was required but not sufficient for Alu RNP-mediated inhibition of 48S complex formation. Supplementing the translation reactions containing scAluY A RNP with equimolar amounts of h9/14A5 did not significantly change the inhibitory activity of the scAluY A RNP ( Figure 5F, right panel) . However, a 2-fold excess of h9/14A5 over the scAluY A RNP diminished the inhibitory effect. Binding of h9/14 to Alu RNAs is characterized by high on and off-rates (25) . In the presence of an excess of h9/14A5 over the wild-type protein, the latter was presumably exchanged with the mutated protein forming the inactive scAluY A 14A5 RNP, which lead to a loss in the inhibitory activity of the RNP.",

We next studied the effect of Alu expression on global cellular translation by measuring total [ 35 S]methionine/cysteine incorporation following a 15 min pulse, and somewhat surprisingly, no significant changes were seen in [ 35 S]-incorporation in response to scAlu RNA expression ( Figure 6E , lower panel, \u2212Ars). Additionally, protein analysis by SDS-PAGE did not reveal any noticeable changes in the expression of specific proteins at high levels of scAluY NF1 RNA (Supplementary Figure S8B) . We therefore reasoned that the Alu RNP-mediated decrease in active 40S subunits might severely hamper protein synthesis from mRNAs starting translation de novo such as the newly synthesized reporter mRNAs whereas protein synthesis from polysome-associated mRNAs remained largely unaffected. Ribosomal subunits are presumably recycled via a closed-loop structure in already existing polysomes (44) . To strengthen this hypothesis we performed two experiments. First, we expressed an estradiol-inducible luciferase reporter plasmid in HEK 293T cells along with the scAluY NF1 RNA-expressing or the control plasmid. Fluc mRNA synthesis was induced by the addition of estradiol to the culture medium at 24 h post-transfection and luciferase activity was monitored during the next 24 h. While luciferase expression increased rapidly in control cells, it was strongly delayed in scAluY NF1 RNA-expressing cells ( Figure 6D ) consistent with our working hypothesis that reduced concentrations of active 40S subunits hampered de novo initiation ( Figure 6D ).",

We used the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a prototype negative strand RNA virus, as a model to investigate the effects of scAluY NF1 RNA expression on viral protein synthesis. VSV induces a shutdown of host translation by interfering with eIF4F complex formation (34) . Although VSV mRNAs are capped and do not contain IRES sequences, their translation proceeds via an unconventional mechanism, which bypasses the need of eIF4F for initiation (35) . HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing either scAluY NF1 or the 4.5S control RNA. After 48 h, cells were infected with VSV (MOI = 10) and harvested 6 h later by which time the host translation machinery was reprogrammed by VSV mRNAs. In cells overexpressing scAluY NF1 RNA we observed a reduction in viral protein synthesis by approximately 25% compared to cells expressing 4.5S RNA ( Figure 6F ).

We present evidence that Alu RNPs inhibit translation by interacting directly with the 40S subunit, although only SRP9/14 remains bound to 40S whereas the Alu RNA is released and can act in another round of SRP9/14 binding to 40S. Binding of SRP9/14 prevents the recruitment of the 43S complex to the mRNA, possibly because the entry of the mRNA into the small subunit is directly or indirectly blocked. In cells, this mechanism interferes with translation initiation on viral and reporter mR-NAs, and cellular mRNAs that resume the translation cycle after stress-induced shutdown of protein synthesis. The same mechanism of translation regulation is likely to be used in rodents and tree shrews, which also contain Alu-like elements in their genomes.",

The Alu RNA is not part of the inactive 40S-SRP9/14 complexes and is therefore able to function in several rounds of SRP9/14 targeting to the 40S subunit ( Figure 5F ). This conclusion is supported by a parallel study from our laboratory (24) . In this study, we show that upon addition of the 40S subunit to an Alu RNP immobilized on beads via its RNA moiety, a fraction of SRP9/14 dissociates within minutes from the RNA to bind to the 40S subunit. Indeed, SRP9/14 appears to equilibrate between the two binding partners ( Figure 5A , C, D and (24)) suggesting that the functional binding site of SRP9/14 in 40S has a similar affinity for SRP9/14 as Alu RNA. The capacity of SRP9/14 to exchange rapidly between binding partners has already previously been observed (25) and is consistent with a high off rate of the SRP14-9 fusion protein from a 7SL-Alu domain RNA (36) .",

The affinity of 40S for SRP9/14 would be insufficient to compete with these RNAs for SRP9/14 binding. A plausible explanation for the mutually exclusive binding of SRP9/14 to Alu RNA or to 40S subunits is to presume that the basic \u2424-sheet formed by the two proteins, which represents the major binding domain for Alu RNA (37), will also be involved in binding the 40S subunit, most likely via the 18S ribosomal RNA. The targeted delivery of SRP9/14 to a functionally important site in 40S also predicts that the Alu RNA itself transiently interact with the 40S subunit guiding SRP9/14 to its proper binding site.",

Short basic oligopeptides are frequently present in ribosomal and ribosome-binding proteins and have been shown to bind ribosomal RNA (38, 39) (Supplementary Figure S9) . The three residues K60, K61 and K64 in SRP9 are essential for the elongation arrest function of SRP (21) and are also required for 40S subunit inactivation ( Figure 2E and F). However, they are not required for 40S binding. Interestingly, in SRP-ribosomenascent chain complex these residues are located in close proximity to 40S (40) . Further studies will be required to determine the binding sites of SRP9/14 on the 40S subunit and whether the protein uses the same binding site in either function. Our data showed that SRP9/14 can be delivered to the 43S complex ( Figures 1I and 5D ) but not to the 80S ribosome ( Figure 5C ). This suggests that protein-binding site is not occupied by the ternary complex, eIF3, eIF1 and 1A but is blocked by the presence of the 60S subunit. The protein SRP9/14 alone had no inhibitory activity, which is consistent with earlier observations that high levels of SRP9/14 are well tolerated in primate cells (11, 41) Only few regulatory factors acting directly on the 40S subunit have so far been described: the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nsp1 protein and the proapoptotic protein Reaper (42, 43) . As for SRP9/14, the binding sites of these proteins in the 40S subunit remain to be revealed.",

In HeLa cells, Alu RNAs are about 500fold less abundant than ribosomes and it is therefore unlikely that Alu RNPs inactivate an important fraction of 40S subunits. However, expression of specific Alu RNAs can be increased in certain tissues, like NDM29 RNA and BC200 RNA in the nervous tissue (6) , and a transient increase in Alu RNA expression has been observed in response to viral infection and to various stresses (32, 33, 47) . In addition, Alu RNA can act in several rounds of targeted delivery of the protein ( Figure 5F ) thereby multiplying the effect of its upregulation. The SRP9/14 is already present and Alu RNA levels increase within one hour and decline to normal levels within \u223c7 h after heat shock (47) . Like other regulatory mechanisms in translation, the inhibitory action of the Alu RNP is therefore rapid and transient. It is therefore conceivable that lowering the pool of active 40S subunits might contribute to shaping the translational response in these adaptive processes and thereby also participate in cellular defense mechanisms used against viral infection. A recent study, which shows that HCV translation was more strongly affected by reduced cellular levels of 40S than cellular translation, supports this hypothesis (48) .",

Binding sites of h9/14 are indicated by analogy to SRP RNA. Preparation of Alu RNPs is described in Supplementary Figure S1. (B) Translation efficiencies of uncapped pPL mRNA in RRL supplemented with increasing concentrations of Alu RNPs or the h9/14 protein or the AluY A /scAluY A RNAs alone. [ 35 S]-labeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantified by phosphorimager (see Supplementary Figure S2A and B for SDS-PAGE autoradiographs). Translation efficiency was calculated as a percentage of the value obtained in the absence of RNPs. Error bars are shown as SD (n \u2265 3). (C) Translation efficiencies of uncapped pPL mRNA in RRL translation reaction synchronized by 0.5 M edeine in the presence of 100 nM AluY A /scAluY A RNP. Translation reactions were incubated 3 min at 30 \u2022 C before the addition of 0.5 M edeine. Translation mixtures were incubated another 1 min and then supplemented with the RNPs. See also Supplementary Figure S2C. (D) Schematic representation of the toeprint analysis.
