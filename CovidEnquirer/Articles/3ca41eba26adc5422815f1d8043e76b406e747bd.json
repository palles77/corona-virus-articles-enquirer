The MERS-CoV was imported by a returning traveler from the Middle East on May 4th, 2015. He developed fever 7 days after returning and was diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection on May 20th, 2015. The infection had spread within the hospital, and subsequently to other hospitals because of patient movements, resulting in nosocomial spread at 16 hospitals [1] . The epidemic lasted for 2 months, with the government declaring a \"virtual\" end to the epidemic on July 6th, 2015. In order to control the outbreak, 16,993 individuals were quarantined for 14 days, with the economic loss estimated at 9311 billion Korean Won [2] .",

They also found that the case fatality ratio was 30.8% (4/13) at Hospital A, and 70% (7/10) at Hospital B. Based on these findings, they suggested that the index patient might have shedded higher titers of MERS-CoV in respiratory secretions during his admission at Hospital B than at Hospital A. His chest computerized tomography scans obtained on May 28 (at Hospital B) showed more extensive infiltrates than that obtained on May 22 (at Hospital A).",

A recent study showed that a shorter incubation period was associated with a higher risk of death [6] . The authors reported viral shedding kinetics of MERS-CoV in a separate journal [7] , showing that the peak titers of MERS-CoV in respi-Oh MD \u2022 MERS and our responsibility www.icjournal.org 146 ratory samples were similar among the moderate, severe and fatal groups. These results suggest that severe pneumonia is possibly a result of host immune response to MERS-CoV, rather than the virus infection per se, as in severe acute respiratory syndrome [8] . Indeed, a recent autopsy study showed that the pathologic basis for MERS-CoV pneumonia was pulmonary edema, type 2 pneumocytes hyperplasia, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial pneumonia with lymphocytic infiltration and syncytium formation [9] . Therefore, a patient with severe pneumonia does not necessarily shed a higher titer of MERS-CoV in the respiratory secretion, and is not necessarily more infectious .",

He did not receive any aerosol generating procedures during the admission at Hospital A, whereas he received nebulizer therapy and underwent bronchoscopy at Hospital B. If MERS-CoV had been transmitted via the airborne route, a more widespread area of infection is likely to have occurred at Hospital B. Then, why did MERS-CoV spread more widely at Hospital A than Hospital B? Had the patient interacted with the patients in other rooms, and transmitted the virus by droplet contact? Had a nurse with possible MERS-CoV contamination on her hands, contaminated the surroundings in other rooms, leading to other patients being infected via fomite contact?",
