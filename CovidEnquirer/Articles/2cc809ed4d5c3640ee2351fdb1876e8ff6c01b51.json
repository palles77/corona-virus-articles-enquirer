Each potential new infection was assigned a time of infection drawn from the serial interval distribution. Secondary cases were only created if the infector had not been isolated by the time of infection. In the example in Figure 1 , person A can potentially produce three secondary infections (because three is drawn from the negative binomial distribution), but only two transmissions occur before the case was isolated. Thus, a reduced delay from onset to isolation reduced the average number of secondary cases in the model. Figure 1 : Example of the simulated process that starts with person A being infected. After an incubation period (blue) person A shows symptoms and is isolated at a time drawn from the delay distribution (green) ( Table 1) . A draw from the negative binomial distribution with mean R0 and distribution parameter determines how many people person A potentially infects. For each of those, a serial interval is drawn (orange). Two of these exposures occur before the time that person A is isolated. With probability \u03c1, each contact is traced, with probability 1-\u03c1 they are missed by contact tracing. Person B is successfully traced, which means that they will be isolated without a delay when they develop symptoms. hey could, however, still infect others before they are isolated. Person C is missed by contact tracing. This means that they are only detected if and when symptomatic, and are isolated after a delay from symptom onset. Because person C was not traced they infected two more people (E and F) in addition to person D than if they had been isolated at symptom onset. A version with asymptomatic transmission is given in Figure S8 .",

This occurs because with better contact tracing it becomes possible to control outbreaks with higher numbers of weekly cases. The maximum number of weekly cases is lower if the initial number of cases is 5 and higher if it is 40 (see supplement). In the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Liberia, each case reported between 6 and 20 contacts 8 , and the number of contacts may be higher, as seen in MERS outbreaks 10 .

Case isolation was more effective when there was little transmission before symptom onset and when the delay from symptom onset to isolation was shorter. Preventing transmission by tracing and isolating a larger proportion of contacts, thereby decreasing the effective reproduction number, improved the number of scenarios where control was likely to be achieved. However, these outbreaks required a large number of cases to be contact traced and isolated each week, which is of crucial concern when assessing the feasibility of this strategy.

Similar analyses using branching models have already been used to analyse the Wuhan outbreak to find plausible ranges for the initial exposure event size and the basic reproduction number 15, 19 . Our analysis expands on this by including infectiousness before the onset of symptoms, case isolation, explicit modelling of case incubation periods and time to infectiousness. A key area of uncertainty is if and for how long individuals are infectious before symptom onset, and if asymptomatic or subclinical infection occurs. Both are likely to make the outbreak harder to control 24 .",
