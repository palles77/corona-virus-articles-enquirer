The present study aimed to analyze the diagnosis pattern of childhood malignant diseases using public health data, and to compare this pattern with seasonal viral infection trends. Method: Using the open data source of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, we extracted data regarding all patients under 21 years of age and who had any cancer, aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between September 2009 and December 2013. The positive detection rates of 11 viruses was collected from the surveillance data of Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and seasonality analysis were conducted with both data. Results: In total, 9085 patients were diagnosed with malignant disease during the study period; there were about 175 new cases per month on average. Monthly stacked time series by year showed an apparent seasonal variation with the highest monthly average in January as 236, and the lowest in September as 120. In winter, significantly more patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, neuroblastoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma than in other seasons. There was a temporal correlation with the diagnostic trends of several diseases and the prevalence of recent human parainfluenza virus. Conclusion: This study tentatively suggests that the diagnosis of childhood malignancy follows a seasonal trend in Korea, and has a possible correlation with viral prevalence in several diseases. Further long-term analysis of epidemiological data is needed to explore possible causality.",

Such variations in the rate of diagnosis may arise from seasonal differences in environmental risk factors, such as infections. That is, childhood cancer might develop in a two-step process: exposure to infection may be the \"second hit\" that promotes overt malignancy in children with underlying genetic vulnerability [4, 5] .

Using this open claims data, we used selected diagnostic codes to extract the data of patients with pediatric malignant diseases. The source population comprised all patients under 21 years of age who had been diagnosed with cancer, aplastic anemia (AA) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD, 10th revision), between September 2009 and December 2013 (Table 1) .

To determine the general form of the model to be fit, residual ACF (Autocorrelation Function) was examined. Considering the ACF graphs, different ARIMA models were identified for model selection (Fig. 1 , Supplemental Fig. 1 ). The model of the minimum Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was selectd as the best-fit model. The Granger approach [10] was used to investigate how many of the current values in the time series y could be explained by other values in the time series y. The commonly used EViews software was originally developed for use in economics, but it can be useful in other statistical applications; EViews version 5.0 (http://www.eviews.com/) was used to analyze the data. The null hypotheses were that series x does not Granger-cause series y in the first regression, and that y does not Granger-cause x in the second regression. Seasonal differences in newly diagnosed childhood cancer were analyzed using the Chi-Square test, and P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To carry out time series modeling, we fitted an ARIMA model to the residuals of an order 3, polynomial, time-trend model with a significant trend. Table 3 shows the parameters of the ARIMA models in newly diagnosed childhood malignant disease patients, and the AIC parameters of the model. Table 1 shows the classification of disease groups, and Supplemental Fig. 2 shows a monthly time series of each disease group. Seasonal trends were apparent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and especially ALL and germ cell tumors (GCTs). In the case of ALL, the number of diagnoses was lowest in September; this increased towards a peak in December and January.",

These findings are more consistent with an infectious exposure than with any other environmental exposures. Variation in the peak seasons would be caused by climate changes, which clearly influence the timing of particular infectious outbreaks [5] . In our study, childhood ALL showed a seasonal trend: diagnosis increased in the winter, and there was decreasing trend subsequently until September, when the lowest number of cases were diagnosed. Childhood ALL is a relatively well-known disease associated with infection, with a peak age of development of between 2 and 5 years. The disease is associated with industrialization and modern societies, and increased prevalence has led to the formulation of two infection-based hypotheses: Kinlen's \"population-mixing\" hypothesis, and Greaves' \"delayed-infection\" hypothesis [15, 16] . Kinlen's hypothesis predicts that clusters of childhood ALL cases result from the exposure of susceptible individuals to common, but fairly innocuous infections after population-mixing with carriers [15] . The delayed-infection hypothesis of Greaves is based on a minimal \"two-hit\" model; it suggests that some susceptible individuals have a prenatally acquired, pre-leukemic allele, and that these individuals had little or no exposure to common infections early in life because they live in an affluent hygienic environment [16] . Such insulation from infection predisposes the immune system of these individuals to aberrant or pathological responses after subsequent or delayed exposure to common infections at an age when there is increased lymphoid-cell proliferation.",

In the present study, we could not classify the patients' stages; however, stage 4S NBL accounts for less than 5% of all NBL cases, so our seasonal NBL pattern is surely different from that reported in the Italian study [18] . With regards to AML, while ALL and AML are biologically different diseases with distinct etiologies [19] , it is possible that different infectious agents play a role in the development of both. Our preliminary evidence for seasonal peaks in several diseases warrants further investigation. We also found significant July and winter peaks in the diagnosis of GCTs. In Western countries, No GCT time series have been published; however, our results suggest that seasonal factors could influence the development of GCT.",

Approximately 18% of the global cancer burden has been attributed to infectious agents, with estimates ranging from 7% in developed countries to about 22% in developing countries [20] . Chronic infections by the hepatitis B and C viruses, human papilloma virus, and Helicobacter pylori are reportedly responsible for approximately 15% of all human cancers, especially in adults. Malignancies known to be associated with infection have been considered as resulting from the prolonged latency that occurs in chronic infections. In general, pathogenic infections could be necessary, but not sufficient for the initiation and progression of many cancers. That is, cancer initiation may require additional co-factors, including secondary infections [5] . Therefore, in patients with chronic infection by one agent, a secondary co-infection with another agent may be an important co-factor in cancer initiation and progression. Co-infections are relatively common in areas with a high prevalence of infectious agents, especially in developing countries. These co-infections can cause an imbalance in the host immune system by affecting the persistence of, and susceptibility to, malignant infections. In this study, we used the surveillance data for viruses from about 100 participating hospitals across the country. The participating hospitals are located in all the 16 provinces throughout the country; not only university hospitals but also primary medical centers are participating. Therefore, this data could reflect the nationwide viral prevalence and infection trends in Korea.",

First, the present study was an ecological analysis. We had no information at the individual level regarding potential confounding factors. Second, we had no information regarding the month of onset of clinical symptoms, which may be a more important indicator because there may be considerable variability in the time between the first appearance of symptoms and diagnosis. Thirdly, there may have been selection bias: although duplicated patients were excluded, it is possible that some of the patients had been diagnosed before the study period. This selection bias is inevitable in cross-sectional cohort studies; however, more long-term study could minimize such bias. The fourth, this type of study cannot evaluate exposure to specific infectious agents, and individual exposures to certain virus could not be confirmed in the open data source. Finally, because the etiology of most cancers is likely multifactorial, not all cases would necessarily have an infectious cause. However, the combinational effects would probably result in an underestimate, rather than an overestimate, of any putative seasonal influence.",

The average numbers of patients with newly diagnosed pediatric cancer were 233, 194, 174, 161, and 151 in 2009 (September-December), 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. An average of 175 patients were diagnosed each month; the highest monthly average was 236 patients (in January), and the lowest was 120 patients (in September). In 2010 and 2011, October had the fewest diagnoses, whereas in 2012 and 2013 September had the fewest. Conversely, in 2010 and 2011, December had the most diagnoses; in 2012, November had the most, and in 2013, January had the most.",
