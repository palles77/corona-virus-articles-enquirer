Efficacy of commercial bovine vaccines needs improvement and no human vaccine is licensed yet. We reported that nasal vaccination with the HRSV nucleoprotein produced as recombinant ringshaped nanoparticles (N SRS ) protects mice against a viral challenge with HRSV. The aim of this work was to evaluate this new vaccine that uses a conserved viral antigen, in calves, natural hosts for BRSV. Calves, free of colostral or natural anti-BRSV antibodies, were vaccinated with N SRS either intramuscularly, or both intramuscularly and intranasally using Montanide TM ISA71 and IMS4132 as adjuvants and challenged with BRSV. All vaccinated calves developed anti-N antibodies in blood and nasal secretions and N-specific cellular immunity in local lymph nodes. Clinical monitoring post-challenge demonstrated moderate respiratory pathology with local lung tissue consolidations for the non-vaccinated calves that were significantly reduced in the vaccinated calves. Vaccinated calves had lower viral loads than the nonvaccinated control calves. Thus N SRS vaccination in calves provided cross-protective immunity against BRSV infection without adverse inflammatory reaction. (S. Riffault). 1 Contributed equally to the work. more than 60% of the epizootic respiratory diseases observed in dairy herds and up to 70% in beef herds [2] . Mortality caused by BRSV infections ranges generally between 0.5% and 3% but can reach up to 20% in some outbreaks [3] . The control of BRSV infections is a high priority for animal health and farming organizations, not only for economic reasons, but also due to the impact on animal welfare. Several commercial BRSV vaccines, including modified-live virus and inactivated single fraction are available for use in cattle. Their efficacy needs improvement in terms of duration of protection, clinical and virological protection. Even though the commercial bovine vaccines probably have reduced the prevalence of infection, BRSV continues to circulate in cattle populations.",

The frequency and seriousness of BRSV diseases are regarded as the principal health problem in calf rearing worldwide and are responsible for large economic losses in dairy and beef farming. The frequency of BRSV infections is very high in cattle less than 1-year-old and the virus may be responsible for vaccine is the dramatic failure in the late sixties of a formalin inactivated HRSV vaccine that not only failed to protect against subsequent infection but also induced exacerbated disease in children [5] . Vaccine augmented disease has also been described in calves and some commercial BRSV vaccines were withdrawn from the market for that reason [6, 7] . Other obstacles to vaccination exist, such as the need to immunize immunologically immature young infants and the presence of maternal antibodies that can have a strong suppressive effect on the outcome of vaccination, both in animals and humans.",

Altogether these studies highlight the delicate tuning between cytotoxic anti-viral CD8 T cells and RSV-specific antibodies, which, although generally protective against RSV infection, may both have deleterious effect [8] . For instance, poorly neutralizing antibodies with low avidity for the protective RSV epitopes can lead to enhanced respiratory syncytial virus disease [9] . The RSV-F and G glycoproteins, which are situated at the surface of the virions, are the targets of neutralizing antibodies. Research on HRSV subunit vaccines has essentially focused on these two proteins, by using chimeric FG glycoprotein, full-length F proteins or a recombinant protein containing the central antigenic domain of the HRSV G protein fused to the C-terminal end of the albumin-binding domain of the streptococcal G protein [10] . However, recombinant G and F or chimeric FG were often found to cause enhancement of lung pathology upon RSV challenge, in association with the priming of Th2 cells [1, 11] .",

            "text": "In addition to the risk of disease exacerbation by vaccination, another critical issue for human or bovine RSV vaccination is the variability of the viral isolates circulating worldwide. An effective bovine or human vaccine should protect against all of them. The nucleoprotein (N) that covers the viral RNA genome, forming the viral nucleocapsid, is the most conserved of RSV proteins and is a major target of the cellular immune response against RSV [12] [13] [14] . Thus, contrary to F or G antigens, N based vaccines offer the possibility of T-cell-mediated cross-protective immunity against circulating RSV. Strategies aimed at using N in a vaccine to stimulate T cell immunity have focused on live-attenuated virus vector and on DNA vaccine. Vaccination of mice with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the HRSV N protein induced partial protection [15, 16] . Similarly, immunization of young calves with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the BRSV N protein induced non-neutralizing antibodies and primed BRSV-specific proliferative T response and IFN-\u2425 production that resulted in reduction of viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract [17] . DNA immunization by two administrations of plasmids encoding BRSV-F and N proteins primed a strong cell-mediated immunity in calves, which drastically reduced viral replication, clinical signs and pulmonary lesions after a highly virulent challenge [18] . More recently a nucleocapsidbased DNA prime-protein boost vaccination was shown to confer protection against BRSV replication and lung pathology [19] .",

            "text": "Compared to DNA, or live-attenuated vector vaccines, subunit vaccines are safer because they do not present the risk of replication/integration of genetically modified material. However subunit vaccines using the nucleoprotein (N) have been poorly investigated, in part because a recombinant N was difficult to produce as a soluble protein. We have set up an original technology to engineer circular nanoparticles composed of 10-11 recombinant N [20] , the 3D structures of which have just been solved [21] . These nanoparticles are named N SRS for sub-nucleocapsid ring structures [20] . Intranasal vaccination of mice with HRSV N SRS nanoparticles primes N-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells and significantly reduces titers of RSV in the lungs of mice following HRSV challenge without signs of disease exacerbation [22] . One major limit of the mouse model is the absence of respiratory disease in response to RSV infec-tion. Therefore the objectives of the present study were to evaluate the potency of N SRS as a vaccine in calves that are the natural host for BRSV and that display clinical respiratory symptoms and lung lesions upon infection. Because the N amino acid sequence is highly conserved between bovine and human RSV strains (\u224894% amino acid identity), we took it as an opportunity to test whether N SRS from HRSV strain Long would provide cross-protective immunity against viral challenge with a BRSV strain. The data presented in this study showed that vaccination with the nano-rings N SRS partially protected against both respiratory disease and virus replication upon BRSV challenge without signs of vaccine-mediated disease exacerbation.",

BRSV ELISA was also performed each week before inoculation, to rule out natural BRSV infection during rearing. Absence of BVDV in calves was assessed at birth and one week before challenge by negative detection of the BVDV p80-125 antigen (Serelisa BVDV-BD, Synbiotics, Lyon, France) and by negative RT-PCR [25] .

For the six calves of group N SRS i.m., one calf showed no clinical signs, 2 calves developed very mild respiratory symptoms and 3 calves developed a moderate dyspnoea. Finally, 3 calves of the group N SRS i.m. + i.n. developed very mild respiratory signs and the other 3 showed a moderate dyspnoea. The mean clinical scores are shown in Fig. 3 . Statistical analyses (three-factor split-plot ANOVA test) indicated group and time effects between the non-vaccinated group and the groups N SRS i.m. or N SRS i.m. + i.n. No differences were found between the two vaccinated groups (N SRS i.m. and N SRS i.m. + i.n.). Significant reduction of mean clinical scores (Bonferroni's test among contrast, p < 0.05) was found for the group N SRS i.m. at days 5 and 6, for the group N SRS i.m. + i.n. at days 5-7 post-infection when compared to the non-vaccinated group (Fig. 3) . Onset, peak and duration of clinical scores were calculated for each group (Table 2) , showing delayed onset, peak and shorter duration of clinical symptoms in the two vaccinated groups.

The strongest IFN-\u2425 production was recorded in the mediastinal LN and tended to be higher for T cells isolated from vaccinated calves (SI of 1.4 \u00b1 0.2, 2.7 \u00b1 0.6 and 2.4 \u00b1 0.5 for no vaccine, N SRS i.m. and N SRS i.m. + i.n. respectively, p = 0.07 between no vaccine and N SRS i.m. and p = 0.06 between no vaccine and N SRS i.m. + i.n.). Thus the IFN-\u2425 response in the lymph nodes draining the airways was suggestive of memory T cells primed by N SRS vaccination and boosted upon BRSV challenge.",

Difficulties of RSV vaccine development include the lack of a relevant animal model for human, the need to immunize immunologically immature young infants or calves with maternal RSV antibodies, the impact of RSV variability on vaccination and the risk of vaccineassociated disease enhancement. We were the first to publish an efficient and safe vaccination strategy against RSV using the nucleocapsid protein alone as a vaccine antigen, under the form of soluble nanoparticles referred to as N SRS [22] . In this previous study done in mice we have demonstrated that N SRS is highly immunogenic when delivered via the nasal route and that the immune response primed upon vaccination is protective against an HRSV challenge [22] . In the present study, we investigated the potency of N SRS as a vaccine in calves that are the natural hosts for BRSV and display clinical respiratory symptoms and lung lesions upon infection.",

The bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), which is widespread in 2-8-month-old cattle, reduces pulmonary defences [33, 34] and thus may enhance the severity of the BRSV pathogenicity. Both viruses, BRSV and BPIV-3, are important predisposing factors in the development of bacterial bronchopneumonia in cattle. In addition intrinsic host parameters seem to control the severity of the disease since severe pathology is associated with dysfunctions of the host's response [8] . In this study, we used a BRSV 3761 inoculum which was previously shown successful in reproducing severe respiratory signs after intranasal and intratracheal injections of 1 and 3-month-old Prim'Holstein calves (G. Meyer, unpublished results; [18] ). This inoculum contained BRSV with few passages in cell cultures and with 3 cycles of amplification in newborn calves, a condition also shown by others to induce severe respiratory disease in calves [35, 36] . By comparison with previous successful experiments, failure to reproduce respiratory distress syndrome in this study could be related to host intrinsic parameters. Indeed, another study, using the same inoculum and crossed Prim'Holstein/Normandy calves of same origin, also failed to reproduce respiratory distress [19] .",

The gene encoding the nucleoprotein is shown to be one of the most conserved between BRSV and HRSV with an average of \u224894% amino acid identity. The nucleoprotein from BRSV is recognized by bovine CD8+ T cells but the precise CTL epitopes have not been defined yet [29] . In human, HLA-B07, HLA-B08 and HLA-A02 restricted epitopes were mapped in the nucleoprotein [12, 14] and interestingly their amino acid sequence is fully conserved among various HRSV field isolates and with BRSV strains [14] . The mechanisms of CTL cross-reactivity have been recently investigated with well-characterized CTL epitopes from HIV showing that biochemically similar amino acid substitutions do not drastically affect recognition by TCR [37] . Some level of cross-protection between HRSV and BRSV has been demonstrated in the cotton rat model in which BRSV was tested as a possible Jennerian vaccine against HRSV [38] . Among the viral antigens that may be cross protective between BRSV and HRSV, the BRSV-F (81% amino acid identity with HRSV-F), delivered as DNA vaccine, was shown to protect mice against an HRSV challenge [39] . The present study brings new data to support the hypothesis of common B or T epitopes between BRSV and HRSV nucleoproteins. Indeed, in our study, primary BRSV infection resulted in antibody and cellular immunity that could be revealed with an N SRS coated ELISA assay or following an in vitro boost with N SRS , respectively. Conversely serum Ab from N SRS vaccinated calves reacted against a BRSV-infected cell lysate. This indicates that recombinant N from HRSV origin assembling into nano-rings and the nucleocapsid protein N from BRSV strain 3761 displayed at least some common epitopes and that vaccination with N SRS from HRSV protein sequences provide significant cross-protection against BRSV challenge in calves.",

In other studies implying N SRS vaccination in mouse or lamb animal models we have shown that N-specific memory CD8 and CD4 T cell are primed ( [22] and S. Riffault unpublished results). Recently a vaccination regimen using the nucleoprotein in a DNA prime-protein boost protocol was shown to be superior to DNA or protein vaccination alone to prime antigen-specific CD8 memory T cells, to protect against BRSV replication and to reduce lung pathology [19] . However, because DNA vaccination is not authorized in human, the use of N protein alone for vaccination of newborn children could be an interesting alternative approach. Moreover N SRS can be produced in large amount in bacteria and their nanoring structure is very stable either at 4 \u2022 C or 20 \u2022 C (our unpublished observations), making their production and storage cheap and easy.",

The nucleoprotein subunit approach described in the present study is efficient for inducing cross-protective immunity against RSV. Interestingly the N SRS structures are very potent at stimulating antibody responses both at the systemic and mucosal levels. We have recently obtained the X-ray 3D structure of the N SRS [21] and have been able to map exposed sites on the nano-rings to which other antigenic motifs can be grafted. Our next goal will be to improve the degree of protection by using RSV nucleocapsid nanoparticles grafted with peptidic epitopes from the BRSV fusion-(F) and glyco-(G) proteins in order to trigger neutralizing antibody responses in addition to anti-N cellular responses.",
