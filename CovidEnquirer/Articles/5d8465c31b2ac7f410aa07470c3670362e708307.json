Factors such as rising global trade, a growing middle class in developing countries, outsourcing, and increasing product complexity have all contributed to an expanded geographic risk footprint of many companies. At the same time, rising global competition, lean manufacturing, natural resource constraints, and consolidation of suppliers in some industries have made organizations more vulnerable to remote disruptive events.",

Next, the models extend to include the sites of suppliers. Third, understanding some categories of risks also entails understanding deeper supply-chain structures into which there is far less visibility on specific sites and vulnerabilities. With these three levels comes an understanding of how disruptions arise and propagate in supply chains; this understanding, in turn, enables companies to develop both quantitative and qualitative insights into the likelihood and impact of disruptions so that they can prioritize their risk management efforts.",

A dispute between the governments of China and Japan over the ownership of a group of uninhabited islands led to a Chinese boycott of Japanese goods, resulting in a 17% drop in value of Japanese exports to China between June and November 2012 (Perlez, 2013) . Following a 2014 decision by China to move an oil rig into disputed waters with Vietnam, Vietnamese mobs ransacked foreign factories, causing manufacturers around the world to halt production (Sevatopulo, Peel, & Grant, 2014) . In 2011, Spanish fruit and vegetable exporters lost h200 million/week after a food poisoning scare caused Germany to ban Spanish cucumbers (BBC, 2011) .

The surveys cover risk management issues such as supplier facility locations, subsupplier locations, business continuity planning, recovery times, emergency contact data, conflict minerals, and other concerns.

The software uses data on the supplier locations producing each part, the parts in each product, and the financial contributions of each product to estimate the VaR of each supplier location.

In turn, other vehicle-making companies such as Caterpillar (construction vehicles) and Deere (farm equipment) feel they play second fiddle to the large automakers who are more important customers to vehicle component suppliers.

Yet electronics were not the only items containing \"made in Japan\" components or materials. GM soon discovered that almost every type of part on many different vehicles required something from Japan. Xirallic, a sparkly additive made by Merck and used in the paint for the Corvette came from Japan. Special body trim plastics, rubber seals, and gaskets came from Japan. High-tech chrome plating on turbochargers came from Japan. Cooling fans, radiator caps, air conditioner compressors, and many more parts had some tie to Japanese suppliers. And each missing part raised the specter of halting production somewhere in GM's system.",

            "text": "The historical statistics of big, rare events hide a curse. No matter how bad the last \"big one\" was, a bigger one is inevitable. As history rolls onward, the list of major disruptions grows skyward. The next \"bigger one\" may take a long time to materialize, or it could happen tomorrow; but, unfortunately, the unlikely is not the impossible. With a growing global population and a growing global economy, the biggest disaster will always lie somewhere in the future. Taleb (2007) popularized the concept of very large and unexpected disruptions called \"black swans.\" These events arise and shock everyone, especially the experts, who are blinded by flawed reasoning about seemingly unprecedented events. The central fallacy that creates black swans is that a lack of evidence of a possible disruption does not constitute evidence of lack of that possible disruption. Events such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis are often cited as examples of these kinds of disruptions. By definition, the likelihood and impacts of a black swan are underestimated (or never estimated) under the mistaken belief that the event cannot happen or is not even conceived of its possibility. Black swans reflect a deeper kind of uncertainty than standard likelihood models because experts misjudge the likelihood of a black swan risk to be zero when, in fact, it is not. In essence, even the most thorough risk model misses some risks.",

Yet the examples also highlight the limitations of these models in terms of availability of fine-grained data on suppliers, especially those with no direct relationship with the company. Nonetheless, even if exact quantitative models are not practical, companies can understand and prioritize risks at a qualitative level. A company can understand such risks through a deeper understanding of the company's dependency on particular categories of deep supply-chain structures such as those related to natural resources (geographic concentrations, price volatility, environmental reputation risks), labor in developing countries (geopolitical and reputation risks), and technological or specialty materials produced by a very narrow or clustered supply base. Although black swans cannot be pinpointed, their nesting spots in the global economy can be considered, enabling companies to think about both obvious and less obvious risks.",

At the same time, companies and government are beefing up their defenses and their planning. Thus the research community has to keep up with both the risks and the responses (as well as the business opportunities hidden in many disruptions), helping laggard companies be better prepared. An area which can benefit from further research is the development of risk metrics and indices, helping companies assess suppliers, regions, network nodes, and customers in terms of the risk they pose. Such metrics have to be continuously updated, automatically, based on the ever-changing environment.",
