To achieve early and accurate diagnostics, determining the radiological characteristics of the disease is of great importance. In this small scale research we retrospectively reviewed and selected six cases confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection in West China Hospital and investigated their initial and follow-up HRCT features, along with the clinical characteristics. The 2019-nCoV pneumonia basically showed a multifocal or unifocal involvement of ground-glass opacity (GGO), sometimes with consolidation and fibrosis. No pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy was identified in our presented cases. The follow-up CT generally demonstrated mild to moderate progression of the lesion, with only one case showing remission by the reducing extent and density of the airspace opacification.",

GGOs detected on HRCT are very often missed on chest radiographs. 8 Considering that GGO is still the main manifestation of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia, HRCT should be the firstline imaging modality to sensitively detect pulmonary abnormalities. The manifestations of the selected cases in our study demonstrated a similar pattern with the reported cases in SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) events. 9 Our findings, namely, predominantly GGO, sometimes with consolidation and fibrosis, as well as absence of pulmonary mass, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy, were in agreement with the recently published study on 18 cases of 2019-nCoV. 10 Nevertheless, none of the included patients had severe pneumonia within the study period, thus further studies are needed to determine whether pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy would be present or absent in 2019-nCoV pneumonia.",

Besides, the frequency of consolidation and severity score were also much lower than in SARS, which might explain the lower death rates of 2019-nCoV pneumonia than SARS. 11 Similar to the MERS cases reported by Ajlan et al in 2014, 12 some of our patients also presented a distribution at the right and left lower lobes, but a more periphery distribution could be recognized in the right and left upper lobes. However, the number of cases reported in this study was too small to lead to a conclusion of a fixed pattern of the pulmonary lesions of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.",

In the presented 6 cases, the three who came to hospital early after the onset of the symptoms all had a clear and direct epidemiology history. But they were all with only minimal to mild abnormal pulmonary findings. In contrast, the other three had much more severe pulmonary changes including consolidation and fibrosis, which were reported more common in cases with severe disease in SARS and MERS. 13 Simultaneously, the delayed isolation for these three cases might have led to transmission to their families or other people.",

Secondly, only five of the six cases had follow-up HRCT within the study period, and thus the change in characteristics of their images cannot represent all of the cases.
