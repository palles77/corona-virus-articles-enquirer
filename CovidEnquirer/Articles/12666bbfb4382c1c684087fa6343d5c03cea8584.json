The authors isolated homogeneous microglia populations and show by single cell RNA Sequencing segregation of microglia in different subgroups apparently triggered by inflammatory processes. This topic is therefore of interest to the microglia community as it highlights the microglial response to an acute inflammatory stimulus and compares it to chronic stimuli such as neurodegeneration.",

By selecting population-specific cell surface markers, they were able to effectively isolate only brain-resident microglia, based on Cd11b+/Cd45int expression, as opposed to other intrinsic or peripheral cells (Fig. 1) . The authors show that upon an acute LPS injection or upon in vitro LPS stimulation, microglia lose their homeostatic and phagocytosing gene expression profile, whilst pro-inflammatory genes are upregulated (Fig. 2) . This data was confirmed using a single-cell sequencing approach, showing that microglia exposed to LPS show a distinct reactive phenotype compared to saline-injected control mice (Fig. 3) . By analysing the sequencing data more closely, the group could identify a specific microglia sub-population (\"subset LPS\") that showed an intermediate phenotype compared to control and reactive microglia (Fig. 4) . They postulate based on differential gene analysis that these cells might either be damaged cells, recovering from their activation status or a cell population with specific DNA repair properties. Lastly, in Fig. 5 the authors compared the gene signatures of LPS-exposed microglia to that of \"disease-associated microglia\" (DAM) that has been described by Keren-Shaul et al. (2017) in response to neurodegeneration and describe high inflammatory reactivity upon LPS treatment and a phagocytic gene signature in DAM.",

(2014) . The relevance of the study for neurodegenerative diseases -if there is any -should be increased by adding the following points: a. Analyse LPS-injected mice once the acute stimulus has resided to evaluate whether microglia stay \"primed\" or whether they return to their homeostatic state. b. Repeat the LPS injection to see whether the acclaimed neurodegenerative microglia signature (Bodea et al., 2014) can be triggered and associate this gene signature to the acutely treated mice. c. Comparing transcriptome signatures in two distinct genotypes, one being a model of Alzheimer's disease (in the case of DAM) could lead to a bias. The differences which the authors describe could simply reflect the distinct microglia properties inherent to the respective model. To be able to effectively compare the two populations it would be necessary to re-run the RNASeq analysis comparing the effects of LPS injection on microglia phenotypes with states of microglia in the Alzheimer model in the same laboratory with the same platform.",

Moreover, the authors could use other methods to confirm this heterogeneity, such as FACS based on differentially expressed surface markers, and immunohistochemistry to define the location of the 'subset' population.

Moreover, labeling of differentially expressed pathways in all figures often does not contain the full name of the pathway shown. The authors argue that microglial subpopulations exist that show differential responses to acute inflammation. By selecting population-specific cell surface markers, they were able to effectively isolate only brain-resident microglia, based on Cd11b+/Cd45int expression, as opposed to other intrinsic or peripheral cells (Fig. 1) . The authors show that upon an acute LPS injection or upon in vitro LPS stimulation, microglia lose their homeostatic and phagocytosing gene expression profile, whilst pro-inflammatory genes are upregulated (Fig. 2) . This data was confirmed using a single-cell sequencing approach, showing that microglia exposed to LPS show a distinct reactive phenotype compared to saline-injected control mice (Fig. 3) . By analysing the sequencing data more closely, the group could identify a specific microglia sub-population (\"subset LPS\") that showed an intermediate phenotype compared to control and reactive microglia (Fig. 4) . They postulate based on differential gene analysis that these cells might either be damaged cells, recovering from their activation status or a cell population with specific DNA repair properties. Lastly, in Fig. 5 the authors compared the gene signatures of LPS-exposed microglia to that of \"disease-associated microglia\" (DAM) that has been described by Keren-Shaul et al. (2017) We acknowledge the reviewer for his comments and criticisms regarding the relevance of the study for neurodegenerative diseases. Taking them into account, we strengthen the results regarding the acute inflammatory model and put less emphasis on the comparison with neurodegenerative conditions. Specifically: -we amended the title: \"Single-cell transcriptomics reveals distinct inflammatory and neurodegenerative microglia signatures\" now reads \"Single-cell transcriptomics reveals distinct microglia signatures under inflammation\" -we shortened the text describing the comparison with DAM as recommended below (minor point 7c \"The text describing Fig. 5 should be more to the point and less descriptive\") -we placed the results regarding the comparison with DAM in supplementary data (in the revised version, Fig. 5 has been moved to Fig. EV3 ) -we built up the analysis of our acute inflammatory model performing additional experiments and adding further results taking into consideration the suggestions from both reviewers. As a side note regarding the reviewer's statement \"The differences which the authors describe could simply reflect the distinct microglia properties inherent to the respective model\", we would like to point out that several relevant studies are conducted by comparing data obtained on different mouse strain backgrounds showing comparable results. Similar observations are also applicable to the reviewer's assertion \"To be able to effectively compare the two populations it would be necessary to re-run the RNASeq analysis comparing the effects of LPS injection on microglia phenotypes with states of microglia in the Alzheimer model in the same laboratory with the same platform\". For these aspects, please refer, for example, to the following article: Holtman et al (2015) Induction of a common microglia gene expression signature by aging and neurodegenerative conditions: a coexpression meta-analysis. Acta Neuropathol Commun. Fig. 2 : The in vitro LPS-stimulation should be done on cultured adult microglia since it represents the findings of in vivo LPS-exposed microglia of mice aged 3-4 months more closely.",

Thus, as suggested, we performed flow cytometry analysis for TMEM119 and P2RY12 and compared their expression levels between steady state and LPS-induced microglia. In agreement with the transcriptional results, the protein levels of TMEM119 and P2RY12 were decreased under inflammatory conditions compared to steady state. We included these results in Fig. 3D . We amended the text and the figure legend accordingly. We agree with the reviewer, therefore we carefully addressed these comments point by point. (a) As suggested, we identified and highlighted the top genes that distinguish the two populations. To do this, we listed top differentially expressed genes unique to \"Main LPS\" or \"Subset LPS\" versus steady state (FDR<0.05; upregulated genes, Log2FC\u22653; downregulated genes, Log2FC\u2264-3). We included these results in Table 1 and discussed the potential interesting genes in the text referring to the existent literature. (b) Please see our answer given to Referee #1 comment (please refer to major point 3d). (c) As advised, to address the differences that discriminate the \"subset\" versus the \"main\" LPS subpopulations from the na\u00efve microglia in terms of function, proliferation and cytokine expression, we extracted these information from our scRNA-seq data and built a new table (Table EV5) . We added the corresponding information in the text. (d) Although we agree with the reviewer that it would be very interesting to study the dynamics of these subpopulations along the inflammatory and resolution phases, in the present study we focused on a specific time point in order to provide a first screening of microglia heterogeneity under acute inflammatory conditions. Follow-up studies, which would analyse these subpopulations at different time points, would certainly provide highly relevant information regarding further characterization of microglia heterogeneity along the acute inflammatory process. In order to respond to the reviewer's questions, in this study we conducted a pseudotime analysis. From this analysis, we found that, along the activation process, the inflammatory mediators are upregulated first and the homeostatic gene markers are downregulated subsequently. Thus, the identified subset may correspond to an intermediate state of activated microglia having their homeostatic signature less affected than the main LPS group, thus being temporally at an earlier stage of activation. We describe these results in a new results section entitled \"Pseudotime analysis of LPS-activated microglia uncovers \"subset LPS\" as an intermediate activated state\" and included the related figures in Fig. 5 .",

We took advantage of primary cells to analyse Socs3 at gene expression level by qPCR and to investigate STAT3 phosphorylation levels by Western blot. Microglial cells treated with LPS showed increased amounts of STAT3 phosphorylation along with up-regulation of Socs3 expression levels compared to untreated cells (Appendix Fig. S1 ).",

Briefly, as mentioned above, we used the Monocyte Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) that has been developed for the isolation of monocytes from suspensions of mouse bone marrow. Remarkably, FACS analyses revealed pure populations of Ly6C + cells after depletion of magnetically labelled non-target cells, i.e. Fig. EV2 and the corresponding qPCR data in Fig. 2D , which further support the validity of our FACS gating strategy and purity of FACS-sorted cells. We revised the text and the figure legends accordingly. Figure 3C We thank the reviewer for highlighting these imprecisions. We corrected them accordingly. Please consider that the volcano plot in Fig. 3C is now shown in Appendix Fig. S3 . Thank you for the submission of your revised manuscript to our editorial offices.

For the second part of the remark, we believe that the comparison of the spatial distribution of \"subset LPS\" between male and female mice, although surely of high interest, goes beyond the scope of the current manuscript. As suggested, several additional genes have been included in the revised manuscript in Fig. 2E . We agree with the reviewer that a heatmap will be beneficial for a better visualization of the data. As suggested, in the revised manuscript the tSNE plots of single genes have been replaced with a heatmap. We amended the text and the figure legend accordingly. The addition of the headings has been done. We thank the reviewer to point out the inaccuracy regarding the number of states. Monocle 2 learns a principal trajectory for the centroids of the raw data cloud and afterwards puts the data points on this path. States are missing when cells in the transition state are very few and the corresponding points are projected to nearby branches. The correct number is actually 9 states for both Fig 5A and 5C .
