Low moisture content in cabins is known to be responsible for headache, tiredness and many other non-specific symptoms. In addition, current widely used air distribution systems on airplanes dilute internally generated pollutants by promoting air mixing and thus impose risks of infectious airborne disease transmission. To boost air humidity level while simultaneously restricting air mixing, this investigation uses a validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program to design a new under-aisle air distribution system for wide-body aircraft cabins. The new system supplies fully outside, dry air at low momentum through a narrow channel passage along both side cabin walls to middle height of the cabin just beneath the stowage bins, while simultaneously humidified air is supplied through both perforated under aisles. By comparing with the current mixing air distribution system in terms of distribution of relative humidity, CO 2 concentration, velocity, temperature and draught risk, the new system is found being able to improve the relative humidity from the existent 10% to the new level of 20% and lessen the inhaled CO 2 concentration by 30%, without causing moisture condensation on cabin interior and inducing draught risks for passengers. The water consumption rate in air humidification is only around 0.05 kg/h per person, which should be affordable by airliners.",

Under such an extreme ambient environment, human beings cannot survive without protection of an environmental control system (ECS). As a part of the ECS, an air distribution system plays roles including distributing air appropriately, cleaning up contaminated air, and minimizing cross airborne disease transmission, towards to creating a comfortable, healthy and safe cabin environment for passengers and crews. However, current widely-used mixing air distribution systems promote air mixing by supplying high-momentum air at the ceiling level and exhausting contaminated air at the deck level. The extensive air mixing is supposed to dilute occupant-generated pollutants, but may also impose risks of infectious airborne disease transmission because of easy access of the exhaled pollutants released by some infected passengers in the mixing context. The outbreaks of airborne communicable diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [2] , the later on possible multi-drug resistant tuberculosis transmission [3] , and the recent pandemic outbreak of the influenza A (H1N1) [4] , etc., confirm such risks are not hypothetical but may come to reality. A new air distribution system that can reduce air mixing on airplanes is extremely necessary.",

            "text": "In addition, significant attention should be paid to the numerous long complaints about cabin air quality and thermal comfort [5] . Since the current mixing air distribution system mixes the cabin air very well, temperature inside is highly uniform, hence it should not be the major reason leading to thermal discomfort. The mostly criticized in aircraft cabin is air dryness, which is known to be responsible for headache, tiredness, eye irritation, nasal allergy and other non-specific syndrome symptoms [6, 7] . During flight, the relative humidity of cabin air ranges averagely from 10 to 20%, as similar to typical indoor levels during wintertime [8] . The intercontinental flights may be even dryer, where measurements show 6-8% of relative humidity may last for long periods [9] . Low humidity in cabins is attributed to the frequent renewal (20-30 ACH, air change per hour) of cabin air with the outside air that is substantially dry during cruise. Such large air change rate is to dilute internally generated pollutants and also to maintain thermal comfort, though current cabin air quality is still being criticized. The other major reason without humidifying cabin air is to avoid moisture condensation on cabin walls which typically include three layers, i.e., from the outside to the inside the fuselage, insulation panel and lining. The cabin walls experience large temperature difference because of low temperature of aircraft shell at cruising. In addition, low humidity is thought to be helpful for inhibiting fungal and bacterial growth. Therefore, until a new air distribution system has been proposed that can prevent moisture condensation, and at the same time a method has been found to better remove the internal pollutants but without sacrificing thermal comfort so that the air change rate can be lowered, the air dryness and air quality problem in commercial cabins may not be well resolved.",

            "text": "Fortunately, concepts of new air distribution systems for aircraft cabins have been emerged, such as an under-floor displacement air distribution system and a personalized air distribution system. A typical under-floor displacement system supplies conditioned air from the low level at a low velocity and small temperature difference and extracts air at the ceiling level. The personalized air distribution system supplies conditioned air directly to the breathing region of occupants. Zhang and Chen [10] proposed the under-floor air distribution system with perforated-aisle air supply, and the personalized air system by supplying air from a seatbackembedded diffuser in front of a passenger in wide-body aircraft cabins, where both systems were found being capable of providing much better air quality than the current mixing air system. Schmidt et al. [11] applies computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to study the under-floor air distribution system for a single-aisle aircraft cabin and pointed out it may have draught risks for inside passengers. Again, with CFD Gao and Niu [12] investigated a personalized air system by supplying air through a flexible nozzle just beneath the nose and mouth of a passenger and claimed 60% of the pollutants can be shielded up from inhalation. Similarly, Jacobs and de Gids [13] proposed to supply conditioned outside air via the headrest of the seat, where each passenger can individually control their preferred condition. In addition, Gao and Niu [14] further explored humidifying the personalized supply air to relative humidity of 40-50%, but results show only the facial region may have higher moisture content whereas the whole cabin is still maintained very dry. It should be noted that a personalized air distribution system usually requires a mixing or displacement air distribution system as a background system, and moreover our preliminary survey shows not all passengers accept such system mainly due to draught complain, even though some of current airplanes are equipped with personal overhead gaspers.",

The air channel is designed to run the length of the aircraft, which is actually a curved air passage formed by the cabin insulation panel and the interior lining with warm air running upward after entering from the underdeck. Such design is in purpose of directly supplying conditioned, outside dry air to the upper region of the cabin, as well as warming the cabin interior linings to avoid possible moisture condensation on them, due to relatively low temperature of the airplane fuselage at cruising. Simultaneously, the other part of outside air mixed together with the recirculated air after humidification is supplied through both perforated under aisles ( Fig. 1(a) and (b)). Such under-aisle air supply is to ensure thermally comfortable cabin environment and also to elevate the cabin humidity level. Finally, the contaminated air is extracted through the both ceiling exhausts.",

As shown in Fig. 2 , the mixing air system supplies conditioned mixed air (outside air together with recirculated air) from both linear slot inlets on the ceiling and extracts air at the deck level. Other settings are the same with the under-aisle system. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) was applied as an indicator to quantify air distribution efficiency. To be comparable, the new system does not change the total outside air supply rate and air recirculation ratio as compared with the current mixing air system. Table 1 lists the design parameters for the two air systems. The designed average air temperature for both systems inside the cabin is controlled at 24 C. Each passenger is provided 10 l/s of conditioned air, in which 5 l/s is from the outside. A passenger is assumed to generate 0.005 l/s of CO 2 and 0.05 kg/h of moisture through respiration. Since in the new system, both channel inlets are only supplied with fully outside air, the supply CO 2 concentration is assumed to be 350 ppm without moisture. The aisle inlets supply the mixture of the outside air (3.572 l/s per person) with the recirculated air (5 l/s per person), so CO 2 concentration is around 933 ppm and has been humidified into 25% relative humidity (at the saturation temperature of 22 C). The mixing system supplies the mixed air directly and therefore the supply CO 2 concentration is around 850 ppm. Because the mixing system mixes the inside air very well, air supply temperature should be lower than the underaisle system to ensure thermal comfort. This investigation does not consider heat dissipation from electronics devices and other heat sources. Moisture content in the mixing air supply is only from air recirculation generated by inside passengers, where the corresponding relative humidity is around 6%.",

Since P1 and P2 are at the window side, the both poles are shorter. When calculating the inhaled moisture content, we have assumed a passenger does not inhale the moisture released by himself or herself. That means the inhaled water vapor content profiles for a passenger were plotted when temporarily turning off the moisture generation of that passenger. Generally, as shown in Fig. 5 the mixing system holds uniform relative humidity of around 10%, which falls within the range of the measured values on airplanes [9] . Such low level of humidity may lead to discomfort complain. However in the new system, after humidification the humidity level is much elevated reaching 20% on average. In the aisle along P3, relative humidity is slightly higher because the dry bulb temperature of air is lower in the aisle and thus a little smaller for the saturation pressure.

The region below the seats generally holds relative humidity of 25% because humid air is supplied from the both under-aisles. Above the passenger thighs, relative humidity reduces due to increasing air temperature with height in the displacement ventilation system, and thus elevating the saturated water pressure. Above the heads, because of respiration and the associated moisture generation, relative humidity increases. By observing the moisture content along the interior surfaces, none of locations reach saturation, so there should be no risk of moisture condensation on cabin linings. The highest relative humidity (less than 50%) is on the cabin ceiling as the moisture rises with air streams to the ceiling. The dry air supplied from the both channel inlets also helps reduce the moisture condensation as shown in Fig. 6(a) . Note at the both sides of the cabin and even on the windows that are usually at low temperature, the air is far from reaching saturation. This is in benefit of the elevated temperature on the airplane interior linings due to warm air running through both channel passages as that shown in Fig. 1(b) .",

The moisture distribution in the mixing air system is very uniform and the whole cabin is maintained very dry. However, against the current air system, the boost of relative humidity in the under-aisle air system is around 10%. Nagda and Hodgson [7] strongly recommend to increase 5-10% of air humidity on airplanes to alleviate the dryness related symptoms, and claim such enhancement of humidity is unlikely to induce microbial growth because there is no moisture condensation in the cabin interior. On the other hand, by calculating the moisture balance according to the design parameters provided from Table 1 , the water consumption rate used for humidification is about 0.05 kg/h per person, which should be affordable by the airliners. For example, for a commercial airplane carrying 300 passengers/crews for an 8-hour flight, an extra weight of 120 kg water is needed. The water load corresponds to one additional passenger weight (60 kg) since the water is continuously consumed during the flight. This research therefore concludes the humidification of aircraft cabins with the new under-aisle system is feasible.",

The CO 2 concentration in the inhaling regions (Z \u00bc 1.1 m) for the new system is around 930 ppm, which is much lower than the mixing system that reaches around 1500 ppm. The inhaled concentration in the new system is close to that at the under-aisle air supply, indicating that cross air motion among passengers is very weak, so that the exhaled CO 2 from one passenger is not transported to the inhalation region of the other passengers. The concentration values for the four passengers in either respective system are more or less the same. Even for P3 in the aisle, the inhaled CO 2 Fig. 11 . Comparison of air velocity magnitude between the under-aisle system and the mixing system at the five vertical poles: red solid lines for the under-aisle system and black dashed lines for the mixing system. around 1200 ppm, whereas the mixing system approaches 1600 ppm.

Due to air supply under very strong momentum along the cabin interior linings, the region near the cabin ceiling and both sides holds slightly lower CO 2 concentration. The strong air motion inside the cabin has refrained the CO 2 plumes from rising far away except for the middle passenger who is seated in the air recirculation zone. Generally, within a small region after the CO 2 being released, it has been diluted immediately. As shown in Fig. 10(b) , the concentration in the inhaling region or above the passengers has no significant difference. It reveals the cross mixing in the mixing system is evidently characterized. By comparing Fig. 9 with Fig. 10 , the reduction of air mixing by applying the new under-aisle system is very prominent.",

            "text": "An air distribution system shall create a thermally comfortable environment for the passengers and crews. As mentioned in the previous sections, the draught risk has been a major obstacle for a new air distribution system being accepted by the passengers. The following details our analysis of the under-aisle air system in terms of thermal comfort and draught risk. Fig. 11 compares air velocity profiles on the five poles between the two systems. In general, velocity magnitude in the new system is maintained at levels less than 0.2 m/s. This is because the driving force for air motion in the under-aisle air system is buoyancy generated by heat sources. Velocity increases slightly with height until Z \u00bc 1.3 m on P1, P2, P4 and P5, due to the continuous heating of the surround air by warm human bodies. In the aisle, air motion is even weaker since there is no heat source. However, air motion in the mixing system is much stronger, especially near the ceiling and deck level. As P5 is in the middle of the cabin, which falls in the air recirculation zone, the air motion is not so evident. The high velocity on P1 and the associated turbulence (with intensity of around 9%) at the head level may impose draught risk for the passenger seated near the window. More detailed analysis of the draught risk is in the latter part. Fig. 12 presents temperature profiles at the five positions. Since these vertical poles are very close to the passengers (in front of the passengers with a distance of 5 cm), temperature profiles between the two systems are similar with the dominant impact of metabolic heat dissipation. Combined with velocity distribution in Fig. 11 , the draught risk for the passenger seated near the window in the mixing system both in the head and ankle level is very high. This was also illustrated in the distribution of percentage of dissatisfied (PD) resulted from draught as shown in Fig. 13(a) , where the PD reaches around 30% at the head level and around 20% at the ankle level. The PD was calculated using the formulas recommended by the ASHRAE Fundamentals [19] . It may also have small draught risk on P2, P3 and P5 at the ankle level. However, in the under-aisle system, due to very weak air motion and also very low level of turbulence (generally less than 6%) inside the cabin, the draught risk is very minimal as can be observed in Fig. 13(b) , though slightly cool air (22 C) is supplied through both under aisles. This analysis therefore concludes there is no draught risk in the new under-aisle air distribution system.",

More research efforts, such as on the integration of the new system with aircraft structure and payload as well as the related economic analysis, are extremely required. With respect to the cabin wall, the insulation panel and the fuselage hold lower temperature than the lining during cruise, which may impose greater risk of moisture condensation. The study of condensation within the cabin wall itself is out of the scope of this paper. The modeling of flow and heat transfer in the channel passages also awaits more exploration.",

CFD was applied to investigate the performance of the new system after successfully validating it in a workshop environment with under-floor displacement ventilation. The new system was found being capable of boosting the relative humidity from 10% to 20% and can lessen the inhaled CO 2 concentration by 30% as compared with the current mixing air system. There should be no condensation on cabin interior linings because of the elevation of cabin side temperature with warm air running through the channel passage, and the dry air supplied from the both channels also helps prevent condensation. The draught risks are minimal on benefit of conditioned air supply from both under aisles and weak air motion created inside the cabin. The water consumption in air humidification is only around 0.05 kg/h per person, which should be affordable for airliners. Therefore, with comprehensively good performance based on this analysis, the new under-aisle air system is recommended for possible use on future airplanes.",
