In Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, these infections occurred primarily among healthcare workers and patients. To identify and describe epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of persons with healthcare-associated infection, we reviewed laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi during January 1, 2013-May 9, 2014. Of 65 case-patients identified with MERS-CoV infection, 27 (42%) had healthcare-associated cases. Epidemiologic and genetic sequencing findings suggest that 3 healthcare clusters of MERS-CoV infection occurred, including 1 that resulted in 20 infected persons in 1 hospital. MERS-CoV in healthcare settings spread predominantly before MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed, underscoring the importance of increasing awareness and infection control measures at first points of entry to healthcare facilities.",

Epidemiologic aspects of this virus remain poorly defined, but human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare facilities is recognized as a means of spreading infection (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . In Saudi Arabia, the country with the greatest number of MERS-CoV infections, exposures in healthcare facilities have resulted in repeated outbreaks and have been linked to spread of disease after the virus has been introduced from other sources (e.g., zoonotic) (5, 6, (8) (9) (10) (11) . The 2015 outbreak in South Korea is a dramatic example of extensive healthcare-associated transmission after a single introduction of MERS-CoV by an infected traveler; that introduction resulted in >180 documented infections in hospitals lacking adequate infection prevention measures (12, 13) . Because healthcare settings have the potential to contribute substantially to the spread of MERS-CoV infections, improving our understanding of infection risk and transmission patterns remains an urgent priority.",

As described during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, transmission in healthcare settings may be increased by various factors: higher than usual infectiousness of patients because of high viral loads or presence of symptoms that increase shedding; use of procedures that aerosolize infectious respiratory illness; close patient-HCW proximity during medical encounters; and other not-yetidentified factors (26) .

After diagnosis, >500 patient-days of hospital care were provided to case-patients in Abu Dhabi; among HCWs providing this care, 1 infection occurred in an ICU nurse who reported not fully adhering to recommended prevention measures while she cared for a casepatient. Although delayed diagnosis contributed to all other transmission events, reasons for delays varied, highlighting challenges faced by the healthcare community: 1 patient was infected early in the outbreak, before high visibility of MERS-CoV and prevention policies; 1 patient sought care from an ED but had no known epidemiologic risk factors for MERS-CoV; 1 hospitalized patient had MERS-CoV symptoms that could be explained by other concurrent conditions; 1 infected HCW with mild illness did not report symptoms and continued working while ill. In the largest cluster, despite strong hospital and public health policies for triaging and isolating patients with respiratory symptoms as part of the MERS-CoV response, the source case-patient was placed under standard precautions, rather than contact and airborne precautions (27) . Reasons for not implementing protocols in this instance are unknown, but the patient's lack of known risk factors (e.g., exposure to a case-patient) likely contributed to low clinical suspicion. This cluster underscores the importance of maintaining vigilance and adherence to infection prevention policy, particularly in regions where known MERS-CoV infections exist.",

            "text": "The severity of illness associated with MERS-CoV infection among case-patients in our investigation ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease, as has been previously reported (4, 5, 10, 18) . Severity of symptoms varied by type of case; death occurred among 2 of 3 source casepatients, 1 of 3 infected hospital patients, and no infected HCWs, who typically reported mild or no symptoms. We identified 3 instances in which transmission appears to have occurred from infected HCWs who reported no fever or symptoms of respiratory illness (patients III-B, III-G, and III-I). Although underreporting of symptoms or failure to recognize exposures cannot be ruled out, our findings show that increased understanding of transmission risks for persons with mild disease and improved strategies for early detection of illness are needed (1,4,7) . This investigation has several limitations. Although the healthcare clusters we describe are supported epidemiologically and steps were taken to ensure that clusters were conservatively constructed (e.g., excluding healthcare workers with known exposures in the community), other transmission pathways cannot be excluded. Genetic sequencing of a limited number of cases supports the epidemiologic characterization of cases and clusters, but we were unable to sequence and assess the molecular relatedness of all case isolates, a step that previous investigations have shown to be informative (11, 28) . On the basis of the current understanding of the mutation rate of MERS-CoV, the genetic differences observed in case isolates from clusters II and III are consistent with 2 separate introductions (11) ; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that these clusters are related. Furthermore, transmission pathways were generated on the basis of self-reporting or other documentation, and exposures may have been missed or forgotten. Such lapses might explain the difficulty in ascertaining a source of exposure for 1 healthcare-associated case (patient V). In addition, follow-up serologic testing for MERS-CoV-specific antibodies and repeat PCR testing were not performed on healthcare-associated contacts, so additional cases may have been missed. Last, by restricting our definition of healthcare-associated cases to persons with recognized exposures in healthcare settings, we may underestimate the true number of cases, particularly if sources of infection (i.e., case-patients) went undetected. Because our objective was to characterize transmission patterns among known healthcare-associated cases, we considered the conservative definition to be most appropriate.",

MERS-CoV can clinically appear with mild or nonspecific respiratory symptoms, and patients may seek care without having known risk factors for infection. Maintaining a high index of suspicion in every patient encounter, especially at first points of patient entry such as EDs or primary healthcare settings, is imperative, particularly in regions reporting MERS-CoV cases. Early detection of cases, full adherence to infection prevention recommendations, and recognition of illness among HCWs are necessary factors to prevent further transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings. Supporting healthcare facilities in these efforts remains a priority. *Of the 19 healthcare worker case-patients identified, 14 occurred in persons who provided care for a source case (cases I-B-I-E, III-B-III-J, III-L); these 14 healthcare workers are described here.

Individual patients are identified by cluster and a letter indicating the order in which cases occurred (e.g., I-A indicates the source case-patient for cluster I).

Arrows connect case-patients with likely source cases of MERS-CoV infection, with arrows pointing in the direction of transmission (i.e., from source casepatient to secondary case-patient).",
