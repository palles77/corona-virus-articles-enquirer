            "text": "Successful management of infections in the immunocompromised renal transplant recipient is complicated by a variety of factors. 1 These include increased susceptibility to a broad spectrum of infectious pathogens and the difficulty in making a diagnosis of infection in the face of diminished signs and symptoms of infection, an array of noninfectious etiologies of fever (e.g., graft rejection, drug toxicity), and the possibility that multiple processes are present simultaneously. Further, because immunocompromised patients tolerate invasive and established infection poorly with high morbidity and mortality, the urgency for an early and specific diagnosis to guide antimicrobial therapy is increased. Given the primacy of T-lymphocyte dysfunction in transplantation, viral infections in particular are increased and contribute to graft dysfunction, systemic illness, graft rejection, and enhancing the risk for other opportunistic infections (e.g., Pneumocystis and Aspergillus species) and for virally-mediated cancers.",

Some of these are latent while others are the result of bad timing-active infection transmitted at the time of transplantation. All of the known types of infections have been recognized in transplant recipients. The activation of these infections may reflect the intensity of immune suppression or result from the allogeneic response (graft rejection), which activates latent viral pathogens. Three types of infection merit special attention. First, in donors who are bacteremic or fungemic at the time of donation, these infections-staphylococci, pneumococcus, Candida species, Salmonella, E. coli-tend to \"stick\" to anastamotic sites (vascular, urinary) and may produce leaks or mycotic aneurysms. Second, viral infections, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are associated with particular syndromes and morbidity in the immunocompromised population (discussed later in text). The greatest risk of such infections is in recipients who are seronegative (immunologically na\u00efve) and receive infected grafts from seropositive donors (latent viral infection). Third, late, latent infections, including tuberculosis, may activate many years after the initial exposure. Disseminated mycobacterial infection is often difficult to treat once established due largely to interactions between the antimicrobial agents used to treat infection (e.g., rifampin, streptomycin, isoniazid) and the agents used in immune suppressive therapy.",

Routine preventive strategies from the Massachusetts General Hospital are outlined in Table 37 -6.

The technical skill of the surgeons and meticulous postoperative care (i.e., wound care, endotracheal tubes, vascular access devices, and drainage catheters) are the determinants of risk for these infections. Also among the common infections is C. difficile colitis. Limited perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (i.e., from a single dose to 24 hours of an antibiotic such as cefazolin) is usually adequate with additional coverage only for known risk factors (e.g., prior colonization with MRSA). For pancreas transplantation, perioperative prophylaxis against yeasts with fluconazole is used in addition, bearing in mind the interactions between azole antifungal agents and calcineurin inhibitors and sirolimus (levels may be increased significantly).

The implications of this observation are important: The net state of immunosuppression is not great enough to support the occurrence of opportunistic infections unless an exposure has been excessive; this observation suggests that it is not the daily dose of immunosuppressive drugs that is of importance but rather the sustained administration of these drugs, the \"area under the curve,\" in determining the net state of immunosuppression.

Given the toxicity of antimicrobial agents and the need for rapid interruption of infection, early, specific diagnosis is essential in this population. Advances in diagnostic modalities (CT or MRI scanning, molecular microbiologic techniques) may greatly assist in this process. However, the need for invasive diagnostic tools cannot be overemphasized. Given the diminished immune responses of the host and the frequency of multiple simultaneous processes, invasive diagnosis is often the only method for optimal care. The initial therapy will, by necessity, be broad with a rapid narrowing of the antimicrobial spectrum as data become available. The first choice of therapy is to reduce the intensity of immune suppression. The risk of such an approach is that of graft rejection. The selection of the specific reduction may depend upon the organisms isolated. Similarly, reversal of some immune deficits (neutropenia, hypogammaglobulinemia) may be possible with adjunctive therapies (colony stimulating factors or IgG).

In preemptive therapy, quantitative assays are used to monitor patients at predefined intervals to detect early disease. Positive assays result in therapy. Preemptive therapy incurs extra costs for monitoring and coordination of outpatient care while reducing the cost of drugs and the inherent toxicities. Prophylaxis has the possible advantage of preventing not only CMV infection during the period of greatest risk, but also diminishing infections due to HHV6, HHV7, and EBV.

[43] [44] [45] [46] Polyomaviruses Polyomaviruses have been identified in transplant recipients in association with nephropathy and ureteral obstruction (BK virus) and in association with demyelinating disease of the brain (JC virus) similar to that in AIDS. Polyomaviruses are small nonenveloped viruses with covalently closed, circular, double-stranded DNA genomes. Adult levels of seroprevalence are 65% to 90%. BK virus appears to achieve latency in renal tubular epithelial cells. JC virus has also been isolated from renal tissues but appears to have preferred tropism for neural tissues. Reactivation occurs with immune deficiency and suppression and tissue injury (e.g., ischemia-reperfusion).",

[47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] Active infection of renal allografts has been associated with progressive loss of graft function (BK nephropathy) in some individuals. This may be referred to as polyomavirus-associated nephropathy or PVAN. BK nephropathy is rarely recognized in recipients of nonrenal organs. The clinical presentation of disease is usually as sterile pyuria, reflecting shedding of infected tubular and ureteric epithelial cells. These cells contain sheets of virus and are detected by urine cytology as \"decoy cells.\" In most cases, such cells are not detected and the patient presents with diminished renal allograft function or with ureteric stenosis and obstruction. In such patients, the etiologies of decreased renal function must be carefully evaluated (e.g., mechanical obstruction, drug toxicity, pyelonephritis, rejection, thrombosis, recurrent disease), and choices must be made between increasing immune suppression to treat suspected graft rejection and reducing immune suppression to allow the immune system to control infection. Patients with BK nephropathy treated with increased immune suppression have a high incidence of graft loss. Reduced immune suppression may stabilize renal allograft function but risks graft rejection. Polyoma-associated nephropathy manifested by characteristic histologic features and renal dysfunction is found in about 1% to 8% of renal transplant patients.",

As for all infections in transplantation, invasive diagnostic techniques are often necessary in these hosts. The depressed inflammatory response of the immunocompromised transplant patient may greatly modify or delay the appearance of a pulmonary lesion on radiograph. Focal or multifocal consolidation of acute onset will quite likely be caused by bacterial infection. Similar multifocal lesions with subacute to chronic progression are more likely secondary to fungi, tuberculosis, or nocardial infections. Large nodules are usually a sign of fungal or nocardial infection, particularly if they are subacute to chronic in onset. Subacute disease with diffuse abnormalities, either of the peri-bronchovascular type or miliary micronodules, are usually caused by viruses (especially CMV) or Pneumocystis jiroveci. 66, 67 Additional clues can be found by examining pulmonary lesions for cavitation; cavitation suggests such necrotizing infections as those caused by fungi (Aspergillus or Mucoraceae), Nocardia, Staphylococcus, certain gram-negative bacilli, most commonly with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. [68] [69] [70] CT of the chest is useful when the chest radiograph is negative or when the radiographic findings are subtle or nonspecific. CT is also essential to the definition of the extent of the disease process, the possibility of multiple simultaneous processes (superinfection), and to the selection of the optimal invasive technique to achieve microbiologic diagnosis.",

There is a continued risk of infection in three overlapping groups of transplant recipients: (1) those who require higher than normal levels of immune suppression for prolonged periods of time due to poor allograft function or chronic rejection; (2) those with chronic cytomegalovirus infection; and (3) those undergoing treatments that increase the level of immune deficiency, such as cancer chemotherapy or neutropenia due to drug toxicity. The expected mortality due to Pneumocystis pneumonia is increased in patients on cyclosporine when compared to other immunocompromised hosts. The hallmark of infection due to P. jiroveci is the presence of marked hypoxemia, dyspnea, and cough with a paucity of physical or radiologic findings. In the transplant recipient, Pneumocystis pneumonia is generally acute to subacute in development. Atypical Pneumocystis infection (radiographically or clinically) may be seen in patients who have coexisting pulmonary infections or who develop disease while receiving prophylaxis with second choice agents (e.g., pentamidine or atovaquone). Patients outside the usual period of greatest risk for PCP may present with indolent disease confused with heart failure. In such patients, diagnosis often has to be made by invasive procedures. The role of sirolimus therapy in the clinical presentation is unknown. A number of patients have been identified with interstitial pneumonitis while receiving sirolimus; it is not known whether this syndrome is directly attributable to sirolimus or reflects concomitant infection.",

The burden of organisms in infected AIDS patients is generally greater than that of other immunocompromised hosts and noninvasive diagnosis (sputum induction) more often achieved. In general, noninvasive testing should be attempted to make the initial diagnosis, but invasive techniques should be used when clinically feasible. The diagnosis of P. jiroveci infection has been improved by the use of induced sputum samples and of immunofluorescent monoclonal antibodies to detect the organism in clinical specimens. These antibodies bind both cysts and trophozoites. The cyst wall can be displayed by a variety of staining techniques; of these, the Gomori's methenamine-silver nitrate method (which stains organisms brown or black) is most reliable, even though it is susceptible to artifacts. Sporozoites and trophozoites are stained by polychrome stains, particularly the Giemsa stain.",

Hydration and the gradual initiation of therapy may help. Alternate therapies are less desirable but have been used with success, including: intravenous pentamidine, atovaquone, clindamycin with primaquine or pyrimethamine, and trimetrexate. Although a reduction in the intensity of immune suppression is generally considered a part of anti-infective therapy in transplantation, the use of short courses of adjunctive steroids with a gradual taper is sometimes used in transplant recipients (as in AIDS patients) with severe respiratory distress associated with PCP.",
