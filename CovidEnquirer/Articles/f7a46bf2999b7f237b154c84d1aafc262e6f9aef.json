Although the majority of coronavirus infections of humans are associated with upper respiratory tract infections, several laboratories have attempted to correlate inflammatory neurological disease with coronaviral infection, and recent reports have demonstrated the presence of coronavirus RNA and antigens in demyelinating plaque lesions in the brains of MS patients 6,7. Furthermore, increased levels of antibodies against coronavirus have been detected in MS patients, as compared with control patients s, and a murine coronavirus [mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)], which had previously been thought only to infect mice, has recently been shown to replicate and cause demyelination in the CNS of nonhuman primates 9. At this time, however, there is no conclusive evidence that any human neurological disease, let alone MS, occurs as a result of human coronavirus infection. Certainly, other viruses, including herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) 1\u00b0, measles 11 and human T cell leukemia virus type i (HTLV-1) 12, have been suggested to be associated etiologically with MS (Ref. 13 ). However, the accumulated data suggest that the human coronaviruses are capable of infecting both the human and nonhuman primate CNS. Given the existing experimental evidence for murine coronavirus involvement in virus-induced CNS disease in rodents, the possibility that the human coronaviruses are capable of causing a similar encephalomyelitis in humans remains open. Clearly, the results indicate that the host range and potential to cause disease by coronaviruses are more complex than appreciated previously and reinforce the need for a better understanding of the biology of human and mouse coronaviruses 9.",

For example, intranasal (i.n.) and intracranial (i.c.) infection of susceptible strains of mice, such as BALB/c and C57B1/6, with wild-type MHV (MHV-JHM) results in a rapid and fatal encephalomyelitis that is accompanied by gray-matter involvement, with infection of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes and extensive damage to large areas of the olfactory and limbic system 14'15. The small percentage of mice that survive the initial bout of acute encephalomyelitis may develop a chronic demyelinating disease that is characterized by extensive white-matter involvement and episodes of demyelination ( Fig. 1) infected with these neuroattenuated strains generally do not develop fatal encephalitis but may develop neurological disease that is characterized by mononuclear infiltration into the brain and spinal cord, as well as chronic demyelination 14-16,37\" Neuroattentuated strains of MHV tend to spread very slowly through the CNS with little neuronal infection and the majority of infected cells being gila.

Although infectious virus was not detected in the brain beyond 13 days postinfection, viral RNA was easily detected by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. Sequence analysis of the cloned PCR products revealed that multiple point and deletion mutations had occurred, many of which were concentrated in both the S and N sequences. Greater than 65% of the nucleotide changes observed resulted in amino acid changes, suggesting that a strong selective pressure exists within the CNS. Many of the mutations and deletions reported in the S sequence were concentrated in the hypervariable domain, originally described by Parker et al. s3 and continued by Banner and Lai 54. These findings suggest that a diverse population of RNA quasi-species, many of which are likely to be defective, persist within the CNS. The consequences of this type of infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic demyelination by perturbing normal cellular function or, if the RNAs are translationally active, by chronically stimulating the immune system s3.

As discussed above, the pathological basis for disease depends on a variety of factors, including the system being studied (i.e. mouse versus rat), the age and genetic background of the rodent and the dose and strain of virus being used. Direct lysis of oligodendrocytes (the cells responsible for myelin production and maintenance in the brain) by MHV during the acute phase of infection has been suggested to be responsible for acute demyelinating lesions in the CNS ( Refs 19, 20, 35) .",

            "text": "The mechanism(s) responsible for demyelination in chronically infected animals is less understood. Although MHV infects glia, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, readily in vitro and in vivo, recent work by Perlman and Reis s8 has shown that astrocytes are the cells that harbor the virus within the brains and spinal cords of infected animals suffering from chronic disease. Moreover, histological evidence suggests that MHV-infected astrocytes are activated, as measured by increased staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 2s. These observations are interesting because astrocytes are closely associated with oligodendrocytes and are required by the oligodendrocyte for normal cellular function. Therefore, any perturbation of astrocyte function and/or production of toxic factors, for example cytokines and NO, may have dramatic effects on the surrounding microenvironment and may contribute potentially to demyelination 25 (Table 2) . Sun et al. 25 have measured increased staining for the cytokines TNF-ot, IL-1[3, and IL-6, as well as NOS-2, in the spinal cords of mice chronically infected with MHV and containing demyelinating lesions. Although associated with areas of viral infection and demyelination, the activated astrocytes were generally not infected with virus. Both NO and TNF-ot have been shown to be toxic to oligodendrocytes s9-61. In the murine EAE model, inhibition of NOS-2 activity ameliorates demyelination, suggesting a contributory role for NO in the demyelinating process 62. Furthermore, recent work by Boullerne et al. 63 suggests that NO may be involved in MS demyelination. Sun et al. 25 speculate that production of these factors may contribute TRENL)S IN MI(:R(-)BIOt_()C;Y",

Furthermore, glial cells can produce chemokines and potentially contribute to the development of EAE and, possibly, other neurodegenerative diseases 65,66.

In spite of major achievements in raising global vaccination coverage through routine infant immunization, today it is clear that infections such as measles, poliomyelitis and whooping cough are highly effective adversaries and continue to exact a huge toll in death and disability, particularly in the developing world z,3.Recent American successes against poliomyelitis and measles have been attributed to repeated 'pulse' vaccination campaigns. Whilst logistic and economic constraints will be crucial, a deeper epidemiological understanding of the mechanism, strengths and weaknesses of pulse vaccination will optimize the chances of success elsewhere in the world. In the light of greater understanding of their epidemiology and the level of resources and health service infrastructure that are likely to be needed to interrupt transmission, a less-sanguine outlook on our chances of global eradication of these childhood scourges now exists. Theoretical study has identified a level of vaccination coverage (achieving a 'herd immunity' threshold 4,s) above which persistence of infection would be unlikely. The threshold is agent and population specific but generally falls around 80-95% of the population having vaccine-induced immunity 4. Smallpox was something of an outlier, with a predicted threshold of nearer 75 % (Ref. 6) . Achieving these high levels of coverage represents a daunting task and, in the face of financial, political, motivational and communi-cation difficulties, may not be possible through routine primary health services in many parts of the world.In this context, it is not surprising that the achievements of the past decade in Central and South America have become a focus of attention. In 1994, the Americas were declared polio free; the last case recorded was in Peru in 1991 (Ref. 7). Furthermore, throughout the Americas reports of measles are at an alltime low, with sights firmly set upon regional elimination within the next few years 8. Much of this success has been attributed to the contribution of vaccination campaigns, repeated at intervals, in which children of a wide age range are offered vaccine 9,1\u00b0. Such campaigns, it is reasoned, achieve their effect by rapidly starving the infectious disease of its supply of susceptible individuals 1\u00b0-12. In a single campaign, a large fraction of the pool of susceptibles in a population may be immunized. The effect is to decrease incidence drastically. In contrast to this, routine infant immunization procedures only immunize part of each yearly birth cohort; the resultant impact on incidence is slower and less dramatic. In theory, following a campaign or pulse of vaccine, there is no further need to vaccinate until the susceptible fraction has been restored through births to its original or epidemic threshold13-xq",
