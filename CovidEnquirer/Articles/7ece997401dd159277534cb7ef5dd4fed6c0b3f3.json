This provides a health assessment of the individual; other cats may join the household; indoor cats may escape and expose other cats. \u2022 Tests should be performed at adoption, and negative cats should be retested a minimum of 60 days later. \u2022 Cats with known recent exposure to a retrovirus-infected cat or a cat with unknown status, particularly via a bite wound, should be tested regardless of previous test results. Testing should be done immediately and, if negative, should be repeated after a minimum of 60 days (when the type of potential viral exposure is unknown, retesting for both viruses after 60 days is most practical). \u2022 Cats living in households with other cats infected with FIV or FeLV should be tested annually. \u2022 High-risk cats (cats in cat-dense neighborhoods or cats that fight and get cat-bite wounds and abscesses) should be tested regularly. \u2022 Cats should be tested before initial vaccination against FeLV or FIV. \u2022 Always confirm an initial positive retrovirus test. \u2022 Cats used for blood or tissue donation should have negative screening tests for FeLV and FIV and should be negative for realtime PCR tests. \u2022 Intermittent retesting is not necessary for cats with confirmed negative infection status unless there is opportunity for exposure to infected cats or if they become ill. \u2022 Each cat should be individually tested. Testing of one cat as a proxy for another or pooling samples from multiple cats for testing is inappropriate.

Creamy pink discoloration of cornea may be seen with lymphoma. Corneal lipidosis appears similar; it may be secondary to hyperlipidemia from hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus, and familial hypertriglyceridemia. Most cases are caused by lymphoplasmacytic dacryoadenitis.
