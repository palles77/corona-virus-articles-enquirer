The mean \u2211PAH levels in the waste ashes varied widely from 4.16 mg kg \u2212 1 to 198.92 mg kg \u2212 1 , and the mean amounts of carcinogenic PAHs ranged from 0.74 to 96.77 mg kg \u2212 1 , exceeding the limits regulated by several countries. Among the three types of incinerators, two medium-scale incinerators generated relatively high levels of PAHs (mean \u2211PAH 22.50 and 198.92 mg kg \u2212 1 ) compared to small-scale and large-scale incinerators (mean \u2211PAH 4.16 and 16.43 mg kg \u2212 1 ). Bottom ashes were dominated by low molecular weight PAHs (LM-PAH; containing two-to three-ringed PAHs) and medium molecular weight PAHs (MM-PAH; containing four-ringed PAHs), while fly ashes were abundant in MM-PAH and high molecular weight PAHs (HM-PAH, containing five-to six-ringed PAHs). Statistical analysis indicated that there was a positive relationship (R 2 = 0.88) between organic matter and total PAHs thus it has the potential to be used as an indicator for PAHs in HW ashes. Moreover, it was found that PAHs in the ashes correlated highly with some metallic elements either positively (e.g. Fe, Ti, Mg) or negatively (Ca), indicating that these elements might promote or prevent PAH formation during HW combustion. Although bottom ash resulted from HW incinerators has not been classified as hazardous material, the results of this study indicated that this type of waste ash contained high levels of PAHs thus need special treatment before landfill.

            "text": "The annual generation of hospital wastes (HW) in China is estimated to be 1.65 million tons , and the main disposal way for this type of waste is incineration. However, most of the HW incinerators were built in the serious situation for dealing HW generated during Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), thus many of the facilities were old and improperly designed and usually lacks emission control system. Currently, many hospital-scale incinerators in some small cities are still operating although China EPA has closed some on-site small incinerators which pose a potential threat to the environment. In recent years, several large-scale and properly designed HW incinerators, equipped with wellmaintained air pollution control devices (APCDs), have been built in large cities. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known as an important species due to the carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of some of these compounds (IARC, 1983) . In developed countries, efforts have been made to reduce PAH emission. It is estimated that total benzo[a]pyrene emissions of 33 European countries were reduced from 1300 tons in 1970 to 590 tons in 1995 (Pacyna et al., 2003) . While in China, emissions of 16 PAHs from major sources have increased substantially from around S C I E N C E O F T H E T O T A L E N V I R O N M E N T 3 9 7 ( 2 0 0 8 ) 2 4 -3 0 18000 tons in 1980 to N25000 tons in 2003 (Xu et al., 2006) . Thus far, PAH has been listed among the most persistent organic pollutants detected in China (Zhang et al., 2007) .",

Studies concerning the emissions of PAHs in the process of fossil fuels combustion, organic matters burning (wood, straw), solid waste incineration under incomplete combustion have been conducted (Davies et al., 1976; Low and Batley, 1988; Liu et al., 2000; Johansson and van Bavel, 2003a,b) . Meanwhile, hospital waste was found to generate higher amount of PAHs compared to coal and municipal solid waste (MSW) because it contains high amount of plastic and rubber (gloves, containers, bags, packaging) (Levendis et al., 2001) . Mastral (1999) concluded that such wastes promote more PAHs formation as compared to coal combustion at the same combustion conditions. Thus HW incineration is an important emission source of PAHs, especially small-scale incinerators which lack emission control system.",

However, in the combustion processes, PAHs adsorbed on solid particles can also cause serious pollution when they evaporate into the atmosphere (Wild et al., 1992; Liu et al., 2000) , as most of the PAHs are associated with particulate material and the PAHs either remain in the bottom ash or are removed from the flue gases by the precipitators to form fly ash. Lee et al. (2002) and Wheatley and Sadhra (2004) reported PAH levels and concentrations in clinical waste incineration bottom and fly ash in Taiwan and UK. To the best knowledge of the authors, however, only limited reports are available on PAHs content in various HW incinerator ashes in China, though thermal treatment of HW has dramatically increased after the outbreak of SARS.",

Part or all of the furnaces are operated according to the amount of hospital wastes collected. Although APCDs are equipped to each furnace, fly ash could hardly be collected in this type of incinerator, thus only bottom ash were obtained. Three mixed samples were collected every 10 days from the incinerator within a month. HWI-II is a typical small-scale incinerator run by a hospital, representing hundreds of incinerators running in China. This incinerator has no APCDs equipped, thus no fly ash could be collected. The sampling activities were conducted within 3 months, and 12 mixed samples were collected once a week. HWI-III is a medium-scale incinerator operated in a large city. Fly ashes were collected in the bag filters, but the residue mainly consists of unburned glasses, plastics and metallic matters, thus bottom ash could not be collected. The sampling activities were carried out within 1 month and 3 mixed samples were collected. HWI-IV, which was properly designed and has well-maintained APCDs, is a large-scale incinerator with the batch capacity of 40 tons per day. From this incinerator, six mixed samples were collected every half-month during 3 months.",

Among the 16 PAHs, phenanthrene is the dominating PAH species in both HW bottom ashes, in the ranges of 13.9-29.9% and 19.5-22.3%, respectively. In addition, fluoranthene, pyrene and chrysene are also prevalent in most samples. An interesting result from Table 2 is that medium-scale incinerator (HWI-I) generated higher amount of PAHs than small-scale incinerator (HWI-II), i.e., 22.50 mg kg \u2212 1 and 16.43 mg kg \u2212 1 respectively. This could attribute to the operating conditions of this type incinerator, which are suitable for PAHs formation. For example, the operating temperature in HWI-I is generally below 800\u00b0C, while that in HWI-II is below 400\u00b0C. Therefore, medium-scale HW incinerators currently running in China may cause more serious environmental problems than small-scale ones.",

It was also much higher than those reported in literatures, i.e. 0 and 47.0 mg kg \u2212 1 (Lee et al., 2002; Wheatley and Sadhra, 2004) . The prominent species in the two types of fly ashes are quite different. Nine PAH species tend to predominate in ash samples from HWI-III, i.e., benzo [g,h,i] perylene, fluoranthene, benzo [b] fluoranthene, pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, phenanthrene, benzo[k]fluoranthese, chrysene and benzo[a]pyrene in descending order. While naphthalene is the most abundant species in samples from HWI-IV, the percentage of this species to total PAHs is in the range of 23.33% to 57.95%. These results indicate that fly ashes from medium-scale incinerators (HWI-III) contain much higher amounts of PAHs than from large-scale incinerators (HWI-IV). This could be partly attributed to the different exact operating temperatures of the two incinerators. Although the designed incineration temperatures were similar for the two types of incinerators (Table 1) , the real running temperatures in HWI-III were much lower than in HWI-IV because of the structural difference between the two incinerators. First, the color of the ash from HWI-IV was grey while that from HWI-III was black, indicating uncompleted burning in HWI-III. Second, the loss of on ignition (weight percent at 600\u00b0C for 3 h) of the two types of ashes were quite different, i.e. 20% for HWI-III ash and 3% respectively for HWI-III ash, indicating that HWI-IV ash contained much more unburned organic matter.",

            "text": "The results of this study demonstrated that PAHs generated from HW incineration was greatly affected by incinerator types. Among the three types of incinerators, two mediumscale incinerators generated high levels of PAHs, with mean total PAH values of 22.50 and 198.9 mg kg \u2212 1 , much higher than PAHs in ashes from large-scale (4.16 mg kg \u2212 1 ), and even smallscale (16.43 mg kg \u2212 1 ) incinerators. Although bottom ash has not been classified as a hazardous material, according to this study, bottom ashes from HW incinerator, especially from medium-scale and small-scale incinerators, contained high levels of PAHs thus need special treatment before landfill. Of the PAH species, the mean \u2211carcinogenic PAHs in the examined ashes are all above the limits for soil application, especially for ashes from two medium-scale incinerators, which exceed the limit values for 100 times, suggesting that these ashes must be pre-treated before they are disposed by landfill. Organic matter content was found to have a positive relationship (R 2 = 0.88) with the total PAH thus has a potential to be used as an indicator for PAH levels in HW ashes. Furthermore, it was found that PAH concentrations in the ashes correlate highly with some metallic elements either positively (e.g. Fe, Ti, Mg) or negatively (Ca), indicating that these elements may promote or prevent PAHs formation during HW combustion.",
