The incidence and occurrence of acute diarrhea in young calves under 3 wk of age is directly proportional to contamination with enteropathogeuic bacteria and perhaps viruses. Contamination will be directly proportional to the concentration of calves raised in close confinement and the occupation time of the calf barn (16, 17) . Occupation time is the length of time the calf barn has been occupied by calves since the last clean-out, disinfection, and vacancy. As occupation time increases, incidence of diarrhea increases and the build-up of infection increases, and weight gains are significantly reduced. Still further, all of these effects are magnified if inferior milk replacers are used (13, 18) . Contamination in a calf barn can be reduced and maintained at a low level by periodic depopulation, cleaning out, disinfection, and providing a period of a few days vacancy: This kind of regularly scheduled health work for the calf herd has not received widespread acceptance but will in the future considering the ever increasing number of dairy herds which are raising an increasing number of calves in facilities which are not increasing necessarily in size.",

Most cattle herdsmen are aware of what should be done to minimize calf losses from neonatal diarrhea, but it is only recently that calf survival and calf rearing have become an integral part of comprehensive herd management. Much emphasis has been placed on reproductive performance, nutrition of the dairy cow, and control of bovine mastiffs, but only little effort has been given to reducing calf losses. An effective herd health program will include constant surveillance of diseases of the calf and calf mortality on a regular basis (every month at least). In this way disease problems can be identified and measures insfftuted to resolve them before losses exceed economic limitations. 4) Increasing specific resistance. Newborn calves are deficient in immunoglobulin and must ingest colostrum and absorb factoglobulins, both in sufficient quantities, to obtain passive protection against common neonatal infections such as coliform septicemia and to prevent mortality due to acute neonatal diarrhea (19) . High immunoglobulins in the newborn calf protect it against coliform septicemia and, conversely, calves which have little (hypogammaglobulinemia) or none JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE, VOL. 58, No. 3 (agammaglobulinemia) are susceptible to coliform septicemia which is highly fatal. In addition, the death rate from acute diarrhea in calves is significantly higher in calves with low amounts than in calves with adequate amounts (9) . The nature of the protection provided by colostral immunoglobulins is not yet well understood but evidence suggests a nonspecifie factor (gamma globulin moiety) and a specific factor (specific antibody) are important components of the resistance provided (8) .",

This in part accounts: for the significant (linear) relationship between concentration of immune lactoglobulin in eolostral whey and 48 h serum concentration of absorbed immtme lactoglohulin. Krnse (10) also found that total amount of colostmm and concentration of immune laetoglobulin both increased with advancing age of the dam, thus providing a greater total mass of immune globulin for the calf bm-n to a mulffparons rather than the primiparous heifer.

This suggests that all newborn calves should be left with their dams for the first 6 to 12 h after birth. However, merely leaving the calf with the dam does not ensure that the calf will obtain sufficient co,lostnml voluntarily. To ensure that a calf receives sufficient quantities of colostrum early enough, it should be fed dam's colostrum by nipple bottle or pail within 1 h after birth at 6% of body weight. It could still be left with the dam for 12 to 24 h to obtain the benefits of maternal behavior. The efficiency of the calf attendant in bringing about maximal immune lactoglobulin absorption can be monitored by the zinc-sulfate turbidimetric test on a weekly basis and can constitute part of an \"early warning ~\" system that the calves are not absorbing sufficient quantities of globulins for the reasons already discussed above (20) .",
