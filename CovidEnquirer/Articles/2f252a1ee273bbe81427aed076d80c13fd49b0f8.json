            "text": "The applications of biosensor and bioelectronic devices may be placed in five categories (Talukder, 2002) : agriculture, food analysis, high-throughput screening, medical analysis, and nanobiotechnology. Each of these categories may be further subdivided into different applications, for example, Talukder (2002) indicates that in the category of agriculture one has sensor applications for the detection of herbicide(s) in soil, detection of heavy metals in soil, detection of genetic modifications of foodstuffs, etc. The author provides a thorough in-depth analysis of the market for biosensors, though the report is 3 -4 years old. Zarkoff (2002) indicates that the average annual growth rate (AAGR) for the biosensor market is around 7.5%. Some sectors such as nanobiotechnology have a higher growth rate (8.2%), whereas others such as food monitoring and biosensors used in agriculture have a lower growth rate of 7.2%. This author further indicates that the growth rate for highthroughput screening for the detection of drug targets is 7.5%. However, since presently this sector dominates the biosensor market (77%), Zarkoff (2002) indicates that it is this 7.5% which is also the AAGR of the biosensor market for all biosensor applications. This author further indicates that the market for (a) high-throughput screening and (b) medical analysis for the year 2004 was estimated to be $1,255 billion and $181.4 million, respectively. Table 13 .1 shows the estimated market value for high-throughput screening for the years -2009 (Zarkoff, 2002 .",

A Freedonia report (2002) on the market for biosensors till the year 2006 estimates that the market will grow at 8.6% annual rate. This report is a couple of years old. Further predictions are provided till the year 2011. A later report by Freedonia (2004) indicates that the demand for chemical sensors will grow at a rate of 8.5% through 2008. This is primarily driven by: (a) falling prices for novel sensors and high-performance sensors and (b) microfabricated innovations. The growth of optical sensors will be the fastest. According to this report, the present chemical sensor market stands at $2.8 billion. Forecasts till the year 2008 and 2013 are provided. Research and Markets (2004) estimates the biosensor market to grow to $10.8 billion by the year 2007 with an annualized growth rate of 10.4%. The report emphasizes that the medical application market continues to overshadow other application areas. It also points out that the rising rate of obesity in the world is leading to increase in rates of diabetics especially in the industrial world. The Research and Markets report (2004) also mentions other areas of biosensor application that include rapid assay biosensors for drug discovery, detection of biological and chemical agents for the war on terrorism, food monitoring, and environmental applications. As expected, there are differences in the AAGR for the biosensor market estimated by different authors or reports.",

These authors also estimate the biosensor market to grow to $10.8 bilHon by the year 2007. They expect the biosensor market to mushroom in the coming years. They emphasize that the biosensor market presents both opportunities as well as hurdles that need to be overcome. They also emphasize the importance of predicting the biosensor market, and the need to identify and convert promising biosensor technologies for commercial applications. Furthermore, these authors present alternate commercialization strategies for each specific biosensor application, and outline strategies to help predict the best one.",

This report was downloaded in the year 2004, and seems like quite an old report. However, in the year 2005, the report estimated the clinical diagnostics market to be around $8.5 million (with, as expected, 90% comprising the home glucose market). As expected, different individuals have come up with different numbers for the anticipated market for biosensors in different areas. Kissinger (2004) indicates that the electrochemical sensors market is at $100 million per year and $1 billion for all sensors. He indicates that the second most common analyte measured after glucose (which is the first) is lactate. However, lactate is a distant second to glucose, and its market is about two orders of magnitude (about 100 times) lower than that of glucose. The author emphasizes that in spite of the large number of publications in this area, the commercial applications of biosensors face severe challenges. The author classifies biosensors in to three types: (a) Single use. Ninety-nine per cent of the commercial market, easy to use, not very precise or accurate, and the cost versus data rate is very high. For example, the electronics cost approximately, $50, electrochemical cell and components ($0.50) (b) Intermittent use. Moderate complexity in use, excellent performance, but high up front cost (approximately $1000-10,000 per instrument cost), good precision and accuracy, moderate cost versus data rate. (c) Continuous use. Very easy to use, poor performance and accuracy, good precision, very low cost versus data rate.",

            "text": "The emphasis on the detection of harmful biological and chemical agents for protecting civilians and civilian infrastructure is underscored by the US government's Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget of $36.5 biUion for the year 2004 (Farrell, 2004) . It is expected to increase by about 10.1% to $40.2 billion for the year 2005. Biosensors are expected to play a major role here. It is of interest to note that, though the DHS does not do any research itself, it does fund other government agencies such as FBI, CIA, EPA, etc. Miller (2004) recently indicates that an after-effect of the September 11 attacks in the United States followed by the anthrax incidents have prompted the US Congress to approve plans and spend $500 million for new biosafety space (NIAID, 2003) . This biocontainment space is required to develop anti-bioweapon vaccines and drug treatments. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID, one of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD) also provided $7-21 million each to build nine new biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratories around the country. This emphasizes the seriousness of the situation and the perceived need for these new laboratories. Furthermore, Kostel (2004) also indicates that there are presently no rapid diagnostic methods to detect Category A bioweapons such as anthrax, botulism, plague, smallpox, tularemia, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Vaccines and post-exposure therapy are available to various degrees (yes, no, and limited). Kostel (2004) further adds that the number of biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories will also increase. These are laboratories which may handle lethal biologicals spread through the air, and for which there is no known cure. Farrell (2004) further emphasizes the need for rapid deployment, and also that biological agents are more difficult to detect than chemical agents. For the rapid detection of harmful biologicals, Baeumner in Farrell (2004) emphasizes the importance of improving the speed of biosensors. Microfluidics does that, but places a limitation on sample size. Baeumner is trying to increase the sample size. The detection is based on the movement of the reaction products along a test strip by capillary action.",

It is reasonable to anticipate that biosensing devices are available or will soon become available to facilitate in the early detection of other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), different forms of Cancer, SLE, etc. At least, this was the general sense gathered by this author whilst attending the International Conference on Immunology held in Stockholm, Sweden, in the summer of 2002, and Montreal, Canada in the summer of 2004. The Singapore Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (2003) has developed a very sensitive DNA/RNA biosensor for early cancer detection. It uses the principle of hybridization wherein a capture probe is immobilized on the biosensor surface. A DNA/ RNA sample hybridizes on the probe surface. The report indicates that the electrical signal generated correlates directly with the extent of hybridization (amount of diseased DNA/ RNA).",

            "text": "The autoimmune diseases are slow, insidious, and intractable. Timewise, the earlier one is able to detect these diseases, the earlier one can put the individual on a medical protocol, and help in the management of these diseases. Some of these diseases, like SLE, are difficult to diagnose, since more than one criteria (such as the presence of anti-DNA and creatinine above certain (normal) levels) have to be satisfied before the individual is said to be affected by this disease. It is reasonable to anticipate that in the future, in spite of the low market demand for the detection of autoimmune diseases, biosensors to help detect early markers for these diseases will become a reality, if they have already not done so. For the diagnosis of SLE, the application of microarrays would be a reasonable route to follow. This would permit the simultaneous quantitative detection of the different analytes required and if they are above or below a certain threshold level or range as indicated above for the correct diagnosis of SLE. Crow and Wohlgemuth (2003) recently indicate that physical insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of disease (for example, SLE) have been attained from the analysis of microarray data of gene expression. Some patterns of gene expression are confirmatory in nature with previous gene expression patterns using other methods, such as increased expression of immune cell surface activation molecules. However, the microarray analysis by Crow and Wohlgemuth (2003) indicates the increased pattern of interferon-induced gene expression in the blood of SLE patients. This study according to these authors underscores the interferon pathway in the hierarchy of gene expression pathways that are involved in systemic autoimmune reactions in general, and SLE, in particular.",

At the International Immunology Conference held in Stockholm in the summer of 2002, one of the invited speakers mentioned that if arthritis has been diagnosed in an individual, it should be 'attacked vigorously'. There should be no procrastination. All of this emphasizes the early detection of these autoimmune diseases, an area where biosensors can be of considerable assistance.

In lieu of this, it is imperative that biosensors be used to help detect autoimmune disease at an early stage. More companies need to invest in these areas.

            "text": "Cancer and other autoimmune diseases go through different stages. It is common knowledge that if a cancer is detected at an early stage, the prognosis is much better than if the cancer is detected at a later ('blast') phase. Roughly, one may characterize the three stages of cancer as: initial (time period typically in years), intermediate (time period typically in months), and blast (time period typically in weeks). Of course, the detection of the different forms of cancer is more and more difficult during the initial stages. This is perhaps true at least for some of the diseases such as arthritis. As expected, the detection of arthritis at an early stage (perhaps by a biosensing method) would greatly facilitate the management of this debilitating disease. Novel methods are required to facilitate the early detection of arthritis and other debilitating autoimmune diseases. DuBois and Shaw (2004) advocate the use of IR spectroscopy in clinical and diagnostic applications. These authors emphasize that IR spectroscopy provides a 'molecular fingerprint' of a sample. This is the basis of biomedical applications, for example, diseases lead not only to physical symptoms, but also to changes in the chemical composition of the organs, tissues, and fluids. DuBois and Shaw (2004) further emphasize that these changes are the basis of chemical tests and medical imaging techniques. Eysel et al (1997) initially attempted to extract diagnostic information from biofluid IR spectral patterns for the detection and diagnosis of arthritis. Arthritis, like most autoimmune diseases like SLE and cancer, is difficult to diagnose, and particularly to determine the stage the debilitating disease is in. These authors indicate that the onset of arthritis affects the synovial fluid in a systematic way. Each stage of the arthritis or arthritis variant has a unique molecular imprint. As compared to a normal joint, DuBois and Shaw (2004) indicate that the arthritic joint contains an increased volume of less viscous synovial fluid. The synovial fluid contains hyaluronic acid. This polysaccharide provides the lubricating properties and the high-viscosity properties to the synovial fluid. DuBois and Shaw (2004) indicate that subtle changes in spectral patterns reflect the different forms of arthritis such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and spondyloartropathy. These authors indicate the need for fail-safe algorithms that provide an indication of the form of arthritis and the state that it is in based on the spectroscopic signatures of individual fluid specimens. Finally, these authors state that an establishment of links between spectroscopy and diseases will go a long way in the management of these diseases and in lowering health costs.",

Finally, Mukhopadhay provides cost for portable FTIR spectrometers, which range from a low of $27,000 to a high of $76,000. The weight in kilograms is from a low of 7 to 145 (definitely not portable, as in back-pack form; portable if carried in a car or van) . Different sampling accessories are available. Thus, Mukhopadhay (2004) indicates the flexibility of these instruments to detect a wide variety of samples. Camilleri (2004) , CEO of Cambridge (UK)-based Rapid Biosensor Systems Ltd, indicates the development of a prototype biosensor (breath analyzer) to test for tuberculosis (TB). The disease apparently kills 2 million persons each year. A low-cost biosensor that detects TB at an early stage would be of considerable assistance. Camilleri (2004) indicates that the noninvasive biosensor is portable and also durable. Results are obtained within 5 min as compared to present-day blood tests that take 10 days or more. Besides, the biosensor can be used by nonmedics. This should find use in developing countries, for example, India. The biosensor system is based on the collection of a cough sample, followed by the detection of the pathogen. An immunoassay system is used along with fluorometry. The quick isolation of TB-infected patients should help considerably in the prevention of the spread of this re-emergent disease. The particular advantages of this biosensor are the high speed, low cost, and small size. Camilleri (2004) emphasizes that the intention is to develop a low-cost generic biosensor that would rapidly screen for other infectious diseases too. At present, the biosensor is also capable of detecting Escherichia coli.",

Mareno (2004) indicates the development of a biosensor within 18 months to detect organisms such as Legionella pneumophia. This organism causes Legionnaire's disease, which can cause devastating effects on human health. Researchers at RMIT University in Australia are developing a device that would provide rapid identification of pathogens on-site. This would be a significant improvement in laboratory testing of samples that takes days. Evans (2004) indicates that recently fluorescent polymer has been used to flag bacterial infections caused by E. coli. This technique is also being used for the detection of cholera, gingivitis, and hospital based infections. The principle used for detection is that bacteria bind to cell surface carbohydrates. These carbohydrates may be attached to fluorescent polymers. Evans (2004) indicates that the particular advantage of this method is the rapidity of detection. This technique can detect a few bacteria in 10-15 min, whereas other techniques take days to make a similar detection.",

This number is much larger in Japan and the European Union (1.2 million and 10.4 million, respectively). Some of these numbers (for testing) correlate with when the disease was first detected in the country or region and how many reported known cases have been accounted for. For example, Normile (2004) indicates that the first known case of BSE in US was reported on December 23, 2003.

The biosensor is based on an antigen (pathogen)-antibody reaction. The biosensor surface has a 'capture' antibody, and a 'reporter' antibody. The primary advantage of this biosensor is that no amplification of the cell counts is required, which is the major cause of the time delay. Furthermore, the biosensor is able to detect the pathogen in the presence of other contaminants. Another distinct advantage is the major reduction in the cost for the biosensor which ranges from $1000 to $5000 as compared to the common immunoassay laboratory equipment that may cost in the range of $12000-$20000 per instrument.

With a view to a commercial profit, this places a serious hindrance on investment in biosensor technologies. Walsh (2003) indicates that the development cost of a biosensor may exceed $20 million. It is reasonable to assume that the development cost of a biosensor lies between $20 and 30 million, and the time panel involved is between 7 and 10 years. This significant amount of investment and the losses incurred in the initial (recent) years before a profit occurs are bound to hinder smaller-sized companies from entering the market. Some of the drawbacks pointed out by Walsh (2003) include the reliability to produce a competitive product, and the commercial development of technology required to produce a large number of devices.

            "text": "Medical Technologies (1994) has listed some of the drawbacks or obstacles in biosensor technology that need to be overcome. Most of them are related to the sensing (biomaterial) of the biosensor. They include sterilization (which will inherently destroy, at least, part of the biomaterial), contamination (limits biosensor to a single use), immobilization of the receptor to the biosensor surface (not well understood, especially its impact on analytereceptor binding and dissociation kinetics; a focus of this book), and uniformity of receptor preparation. Other factors mentioned include selectivity, detection limit, and reproducibility. New nanofabrication devices to produce these miniaturized biosensors are urgently required. Also, emphasis needs to be placed on improving existing transduction technologies and the application of newer transduction technologies. A single use or a disposable biosensor would exhibit considerable potential to enhance the market share. This is especially true since very little is known about the regeneration of biosensors. Obducat (2004) indicates that biosensor technologies due to cost issues are relying on semiconductor processes that are one or two generations old. This limits their sensitivities and tends to make the detection slower. Besides, the sensor area is limited since patterns cannot be made smaller than 5-50 luim in line widths. This company indicates that its Obducat Micronano process can make structures that are 100 nm and less. The process uses electron beam lithography. The company emphasizes that these smaller structures permit the manufacture of sensors at a low cost that respond faster and also exhibit a high degree of sensitivity. van Hoof et al. (2004) recently indicate that microsystems technology is used presently to make tiny sensors. The principle is similar to that used for integrated circuit production. These authors emphasize the advantages of monolithic integration as compared to sideby-side integration. Figure 13 .1 shows the side-by-side and the monolithic integration. These authors indicate that monolithic integration saves volume, electric power, and possibly cost. However, this does come at a price in that different materials and processing techniques need to be combined on the same substrate, van Hoof et al. (2004) emphasize the two basic tenets of sensor technology: a good sensor material and a viable process technology. These authors further emphasize that for future smart sensors for personal health, comfort, and safety monitoring (such as glucose monitoring for diabetics), the sensors need to possess power autonomy, be miniaturized as much as possible, and also be disposable. The advantage of being disposable as suggested by van Hoof et al. (2004) is that they need not be as durable as present-day sensors.",

QTL's expertise lies in integrating chemistry, molecular and cell biology, and in instrumentation. United First Responders provides products and training services with regard to chemical and biological threat detection.

Furthermore, their printable materials may be used costeffectively in high-volume manufacturing processes for biosensors. The company states that it has been able to make these advanced materials for biosensor applications due to its strengths in materials science, chemistry, and fine particle technology. For example, their platinized carbon may be used as working electrodes in amperometric sensors for analyte detection.",

            "text": "As far as materials are concerned van Hoof et al. (2004) indicate that due to its large processing power per unit area, silicon will presumably remain the material of choice, generally used for smart sensors. The large processing power per unit area permits a decrease in area and a lower cost for the sensor. Finally, these authors indicate that future cheap materials for sensors may probably be polymers, metals, textile materials, or even paper (Ender et ai, 2004) . Biowise (2000) too has also mentioned the disadvantages of the receptor molecule used in biosensors. It has classified receptors into: enzymes, antibodies, and microorganisms. Other types of receptors for biosensors are also available. However, at present, we only analyze enzymes, antibodies, and microorganisms. These three types of receptors have advantages also, but here we concentrate only on the bottlenecks/disadvantages. As far as enzymes are concerned these receptors have limited shelf life, they are susceptible to inhibition by other (than the analyte) substances present in the sample, and ambient conditions. The shelf life of these types of biosensors may be increased by improving the way by which the enzyme(s) (or other receptors) are deposited on the biosensor surface (Biowise, 2000) . Adverse pH and temperature conditions may quickly inactivate the enzyme making it useless as a receptor. Though significant advances are being made in antibody technology, this is still classified as an emerging technology, and target analytes may thus be limited (Biowise, 2000) . Furthermore, antibodies are very specific and cannot detect unknown substances. The speed of response also needs to be improved when using antibodies in an ELISA format. The response time may generally decrease from hours (ELISA format) to minutes when they are used in a biosensor format. When microorganisms are used as receptors in a biosensor format, the results are often variable (Biowise, 2000) , and the response time is larger than when other types of receptors are used on biosensor surfaces. Biowise (2000) further indicates that the response time needs to be decreased to the order of 15-60 min when microorganisms are used as receptors on biosensor surfaces for them to become competitive. Raghupathy (2002) briefly mentions two requirements or performance parameters for effective biosensor operations. These are sensitivity and a fast response. The detection of analyte concentrations at nanomolar or lower is considered as highly sensitive, and the fast response has a time frame of milliseconds.",

This company has attempted to overcome or mitigate these limitations. They have a patented process that treats the optic fiber used for biosensors. The process minimizes nonspecific binding. The company indicates that previously proteins in biological fluids of interest such as blood, serum, and urine have prevented fiber optic biosensors from operating successfully. Furthermore, the natural fluorescence of biological substances present in serum, urine or in environmental samples has prevented fiber optic biosensors to be used in sensitive measurements. Three-fold sensors (TFS) has managed to use sensors wherein the fluorescence characteristics are clearly different from the biological fluorescence exhibited by the compounds that are not of interest.

TFS' biosensor design minimizes these losses, besides improving the collection efficiency for the fluorescence from the biosensor surface. The company emphasizes that their biosensor design permits the detection of analytes at the subpicogram level. A reason that hinders reproducible results is the variations on the fiber optic surface. This points to differing degrees of heterogeneity (different fractal dimensions, Df) (Sadana, 2003) . The present author is not surprised with this statement, since in this whole chapter we have indicated that, in general, the binding and the dissociation coefficient(s) are very sensitive to the degree of heterogeneity that exists on the biosensor surface. TFS, however, uses a unique self-calibrating method that minimizes the ill effects of these variations on the fiber optic surface on the reproducibility. Finally, tapered optical fibers result in yielding a better sensitivity. However, previous fabrication techniques were not suitable to manufacture these types of fibers. The TFS design process does overcome this limitation to a large degree.",

The company further states that the implant life of the biosensor is expected to be over a year. Finally, the company indicates the worldwide market for their implantable biosensor to be over $1 billion. Madou (2002) indicates that the high cost of disposable biosensors hinders the introduction of disposable biosensors in the POC market. This author is examining nonsilicon materials (biomaterials) for use in the manufacture of chemical and biosensors. This author indicates that the use of a polyimide material for biosensors has the potential of decreasing the biosensor cost by an order of magnitude than planar electrochemical sensors. Madou (2002) emphasizes that their polyimide biosensor is estimated to cost $0.3-1 (this cost is comparable to glucose-measuring strips) rather than the $3-10 cost for small biosensor arrays. The author emphasizes the additional advantage due to miniaturization, in that the biosensor size will be reduced approximately by 50% when compared with the present-day biosensors due to improved architectural design facilitated by placing the modular structure of the biosensor one on top of the other, rather than side by side. See Figure 13 .1. in a recent article, 'building a better biosensor', indicates that even though quite a few biosensors have been prototyped, they may not make it into the field. Biosensors are required that would detect agents at very low levels, in real time, and over long periods (preferably unattended). The trick is to take the laboratory know-how and effectively translate it for use in real-life applications. Portable, inexpensive, and rapidly deployable biosensors are required which can be used on-site. This author emphasizes that problems and challenges remain in translating biosensor detection technologies from the laboratory to the market. Ideally, one would require a universal biosensor that would be able to detect all harmful biological agents.",

Santana (2002) indicates the development of the Automated Bioaerosol Collection and Detection (ABCD) system. This system continuously monitors biological agents in carrier facilities. The system automatically conducts tests at intervals of 5 min for near real-time bioaerosol detection. Carriveau (2002) mentions the application of combining several sensor technologies to produce the next generation of chemical vapor detectors that reduces the false alarm rates during the detection of live chemical warfare agents and difficult interferents.

It is the leading provider of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. This instrument is continuously being upgraded by the company, and is very frequently used to analyze biomolecular reactions occurring on surfaces and interfaces. The advantage of the SPR biosensor is that it provides high-quality real-time data of these biomolecular interactions. The software that comes along with it does provide values of the binding and dissociation rate coefficients as well as affinity values. The SPR is an expensive piece of equipment and it generally costs around $300,000-400,000 depending on the model that one purchases. Unfortunately, and this may be the sole opinion of this author, the software program that comes along with the SPR biosensor does not take into account either the diffusional aspects or the degree of heterogeneity that exists on the SPR chip surface whilst analyzing the kinetics of biomolecular reactions. Other biosensor users are also gradually resorting to other types of biosensors to help analyze the kinetics of these biomolecular interactions. However, this point has been discussed quite a bit in the previous chapters of this book and will not be further discussed here. Over here, our main intention is to present an idea of the growth of Biacore from its inception in 1984. Mead (2001) indicates that Biacore has a niche which is to provide an analytical tool (albeit expensive) to help analyze biomolecular interactions in real-time. Pharmaceutical companies can use this SPR biosensor to help in drug discovery. This is a very popular biosensor and is used frequently in both the industrial and academic environments. This biosensor, as indicated earlier in this book, is finding increasing usage albeit its presumed 'shortcomings.'",

At the outset, please note that the numbers from the Hoover (internet source) and that given in Mead's (2001) article differ by $5.7 million. The Mead number for the year 2000 is $40.9 million, and the number in the Hoover Internet source for the same year is $46.6 million.

The company is making smart alliances worldwide (North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, India, and Asia). It has also sold its first biosensor system to Japan and has carried out successful tests of its drug detection systems with the Canadian and American Customs authorities.

Though only one example of a small biosensor company is given, these numbers do appear to be typical with regard to investment and time of what it takes to make a biosensor company profitable. Some examples of the investment and time involved in setting up a biosensor company were given above. Perhaps, it is instructive to provide some real life numbers if one wants to set up a stand-alone biosensor industry. The numbers presented here are different from the ones if one were to just expand or diversify into biosensors. In the second case, biosensors are not the only product that one manufactures and attempts to sell in the market. For much better, and a more detailed, analysis on the commercial applications of biosensors one may refer to Biosensors: A Clearer View by Newman et al. This is an expensive book that has recently come out in 2004, but is presumably well worth its price since it is written and compiled with the leading authority in biosensors.",

Criteria A. This is a highly competitive market. This company estimates that there are 18.3 million diabetics in the United States alone. Each year 1.3 million diabetics are added to this number. Most reports, along with the American Diabetic Association (ADA), indicate that this autoimmune disease is reaching epidemic proportions. There are quite a few big name companies that have diagnostic devices and POC monitoring devices for determining glucose levels in blood. If the disease is not treated properly or glucose levels are not monitored carefully, then heart disease, blindness, kidney damage, and other medical conditions may result. Criteria B and C. Measuring of blood glucose levels is extremely painful and inconvenient. This often leads to negligence in glucose monitoring which is undesirable. Better, less invasive and painful measurement techniques would promote the compliance of measuring glucose levels. Pelikan's innovative and novel technology is aimed to address this issue of inconvenience and pain, and help provide an efficient blood glucose monitoring sensor. Pelikan technology is aimed at transforming the multi-step, painful, and 'difficult to use' present-day glucose monitoring systems to a one-step, simple to use and automated, and much less painful procedure which is also reliable. Furthermore, the company hopes to use their technology platform for the monitoring of analytes in blood for the detection of other ailments. This aspect cannot be over-emphasized, that is making the POC test painless. Even at a higher cost, it is safe to presume that if the test is painless, most individuals would purchase the POC test, and this would lead to a significantly higher compliance rate.",
