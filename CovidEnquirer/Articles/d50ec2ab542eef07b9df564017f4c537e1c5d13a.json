In particular, ARIs are responsible for decreased job performance, loss of work-time, and hospitalization, which seriously impact unit readiness.

[18] In military environments, adopting simple hand washing programs that mandate hand washing at least 5 times daily significantly reduces the incidence of respiratory illness. [12] Despite the importance of hand washing for the prevention of ARIs, performing hand washing during field training might not be feasible under certain circumstances related to water shortage, that is, field training during a very cold winter season. However, a few data are available on whether adopting hand washing during field training can reduce ARIs among trainees participating in basic military training. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that implementation of hand washing during field training can reduce ARI incidence of military trainees. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of hand washing during field training on ARI outbreaks in an army training center.",

While one battalion (the early hand washing group) performed hand washing during field training beginning in the first week, the other battalion did not perform hand washing during field training for the first 2 weeks. Beginning from the third week of training, we implemented the same hand washing methods for the late hand washing group that had not implemented it in the first 2 weeks. It was impossible to implement the same hand washing methods during field training as those performed in the barracks due to the lack of available tap water. Because of this, the hand washing method was modified as follows: water and basins for washing hands were provided via military trucks. Four wash basins were provided to each squad (about 10 trainees each). Wash basins were located in a row. The wash basin in the first row was filled with soapy water (a piece of soap was dissolved in about 4 liters of water) and the others were filled with only tap water. Under supervision of the squad commander, every trainee in each squad washed their hands in a line one after the other. After washing in the 4 basins, the squad commander distributed a bucket of water to each trainee. Hand washing was generally performed 3 times during field training: once in the morning after training for 2 hours, again before lunch, and again after training for 3 hours in the afternoon during field training.",

If an individual trainee was infected with a virus, that virus would be transmitted to other trainees via hand-to-hand contact when sharing training tools.

Furthermore, this study was relatively well controlled because the environments of the 2 groups were almost the same, with the exception of their hand washing regimes. The lower rate of ARI prevention in the late hand washing group may be attributed to the ineffectiveness of hand washing when the pathogen is already widely spread throughout a group. Thus, our study suggests that hand washing during outdoor activities should be emphasized as early as possible, especially to those who live in groups in which endemic viral infections are expected. We also suspect this can be applied to the general population.",

Therefore, there might be lack of observed compliance with the hand washing technique described. However, since the hand washing in the field was performed under the control of a squad commander, this effect might not be significant. Another limitation is that this study was not fully controlled. For ethical reasons, we did not compare either hand washing group to a strictly non-hand washing group; specifically, after noticing that hand washing during field training was only implemented in 1 battalion, we implemented hand washing in the other battalion beginning from the third week. Therefore, in the near future, we will need a well-controlled and better designed prospective study at military training centers. Last, due to lack of tap water, we modified the hand washing methods used during field training. Recently, more convenient methods such as alcohol-based hand cleansing have been adopted and have shown their effectiveness in many clinical settings, including those at military training facilities, [8, 20, [24] [25] [26] [27] and may be applicable to our study population. Thus, future studies are needed to demonstrate whether other methods such as alcohol-based hand cleansing during field training further decrease ARI incidence at military training facilities.",
