The CDV Cornell A75-17 strain produces a delayed, subacute to chronic, demyelinating CNS disease . In contrast, the Snyder Hill (CDV-SH) strain-associated neurological disease is more acute in onset, is usually non-demyelinating and primarily produces lesions in the gray matter . In these studies we describe the effects of these two virulent and one avirulent CDV strain, Rockborn (CDV-RO), on astrocytes in dissociated canine brain cell cultures . In multiple replicate experiments, astrocytes were infected most rapidly by CDV-RO [100% of astrocytes were infected by 14 days post-inoculation (p .i .)] . This strain caused severe cytopathic effect (CPE) and cytolysis . CDV-SH similarly produced a rapid infection of the astrocytes . In contrast . CDV A75-17 infected less than 25% of the astrocyte population during the first 28 days p .i . (\u00b17 days) ; after 28 days p .i ., a rapid rise in astrocyte infection occurred . Both virulent viruses caused astrocytic syncytial formation but did not cause cytolysis of the astrocyte population as was observed with the attenuated virus . Titers of infectious virus, released into the supernatant fluid, reflected the degree of astrocyte infection . Virus released by the cultures late in CDV A75-17 infection showed enhanced ability to infect newly derived astrocytes ; in contrast, brain cell passaged CDV-SH did not show increased growth in these cells . These results show that (1) there is a difference in growth rate, CPE and capacity for adaptation of three different CDV strains in astrocytes in vitro, and (2) some aspects of the disease (such as persistence in white matter) produced by the virulent strains in vivo may be related to the course of astrocyte infection observed in vitro .",

CDV-SH which produces a more rapid disease course of disease in vivo also infected astrocytes much more rapidly in culture . However, in vivo, CDV also infects cells other than astrocytes (leptomeningeal cells, neurons, ependymal cells, pericytes and microglia) . Therefore the CNS disease pattern cannot be explained on the basis of astrocyte infection alone . However, the capacity to infect and spread between astrocytic cells in vitro without causing cell death, may be an indicator of the capacity of a virus strain to persist in the white matter of the central nervous system . The mechanism of demyelination associated with certain strains of CDV, such as A75-17, remains unknown . Oligodendrocyte infection by CDV in vivo has been documented 13 but appears to be rare and is of uncertain importance . The role of astrocytic infection in CDE has mostly been studied in dogs with the subacute to chronic demyelinating form of encephalitis caused by the A75-1 7 strain . Since type 2 astrocytes have been proposed to play a role in the myelination 14 infection of this cell type could be related to myelin breakdown .

Dissociated brain cell cultures were established from 1 -to 2-dayold specific-pathogen-free beagle dogs by a modification of the McCarthy and DeVellis 19 method . The animals were killed with ether and the brain aseptically removed . The cerebral hemispheres and midbrain were retained and the meninges were removed . This tissue was mechanically dissociated by gently triturating 15 times through a wide bore pipette . The brain tissue was suspended in 15 ml of Eagle's Basal Medium and shaken on a rotary shaker for 15 min at 150 rpm at 37\u00b0C followed by addition of trypsin (0 .1% final concentration) . The tissue then continued incubation for 20 min . The cell suspension in Eagle's Basal Medium containing 15% fetal calf serum (FCS) was filtered through cheesecloth and then nylon filters (Nitex 130 and 35) . The cells were seeded at a concentration of 5 x 10 5 live cells per ml in 1 .0 ml Leighton tubes containing 35 x 1 1 cm glass coverslips . After 4 days in vitro culture medium was replaced . After 7 days in vitro the FCS concentration was reduced to 10% and the medium was replaced three times a week . The cultures were incubated at 37' in the presence of 5% Co e . Confluency Detection of viral antigen in astrocytes . CDV antigen was localized within astrocytes by double immunofluorescence . Coverslips were fixed in acetone for 5 min at room temperature, rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Dako Corp .) diluted 1 :50 in PBS . This was followed by a PBS rinse and a second incubation in rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) diluted 1 :20 . Viral antigen within the astrocytes was then identified with anti-CDV hyperimmune dog serum directly conjugated to fluorescein .\" Cells were viewed on a Leitz epifluorescent microscope equipped with rhodamine (530-560 nm) and fluorescein (470-490 nm) filters .",

Using a 50xwater immersion objective, (Leitz Corp .) the total number of astrocytes in a field, identified by GFAP staining under rhodamine fluorescence, was counted . Changing the filter from rhodamine to fluorescein then allowed the number of CDV infected astrocytes in the same field to be counted (Fig . 2 ) . Ten random fields, containing an average of 20 astrocytes per field, were examined on each coverslip . The percentage of infected astrocytes in each field was determined and an average of these 10 fields was calculated . At each time point, three coverslips from CDV-SH, CDV A75-17 and CDV-RO infected cultures were evaluated and results averaged . Thus infection at each time point for the three viral strains is based on an examination of approximately 600 astrocytes . The data reported are from one representative experiment ; each experiment was repeated at least three times .",
