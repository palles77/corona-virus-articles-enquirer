Coronavirus infection is associated with the autophagic process, however, little is known about the mechanisms of autophagy induction and its contribution to coronavirus regulation of host innate responses. Here, we show that the membrane-associated papain-like protease PLP2 (PLP2-TM) of coronaviruses acts as a novel autophagyinducing protein. Intriguingly, PLP2-TM induces incomplete autophagy process by increasing the accumulation of autophagosomes but blocking the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Furthermore, PLP2-TM interacts with the key autophagy regulators, LC3 and Beclin1, and promotes Beclin1 interaction with STING, the key regulator for antiviral IFN signaling. Finally, knockdown of Beclin1 partially reverses PLP2-TM's inhibitory effect on innate immunity which resulting in decreased coronavirus replication. These results suggested that coronavirus papain-like protease induces incomplete autophagy by interacting with Beclin1, which in turn modulates coronavirus replication and antiviral innate immunity.",

Under stress conditions such as starvation, autophagic acitivity is greatly augmented from its basal levels, providing recyclable resources that help maintain metabolism and ATP levels for cell survival (Rabinowitz and White, 2010) .

It is tightly regulated by a number of autophagy-related genes (ATG) and other multiple protein complexes (Kroemer and Levine, 2008) . The ULK1-Atg13-FIP 2000 and class III PI3K complex, which contain Beclin1 and vps34, among other key components, Xiaojuan Chen and Kai Wang contributed equally to this work. regulate the initiation and nucleation of phagophore, the precursor of autophagic membranes. In the stage of elongation and complete closure of autophagosome membranes, two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems come into play. The first one is the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L complex conjugation system and the second involves Atg4B, Atg3 and Atg7. The net outcome of the ubiquitin-like reactions catalyzed by these two systems is the conversion of microtubule associated protein 1B light chain 3 (LC3) from its cytosolic form (LC3-I) to the membrane bound, phosphatidylethanolamine conjugated form (LC3-II), a process known as LC3 lipidation. The conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II is a hallmark of autophagy and is indicative of autophagic activity, which can be monitored by LC3 immunoblotting or immunofluorescence (to monitor LC3 puncta formation) Choi et al., 2013; Kabeya et al., 2000; Mizushima et al., 2010) .

            "text": "During their co-evolution with hosts, viruses have acquired elaborate strategies to evade, counteract and sometimes co-opt protective mechanisms of host cells. Unfortunately, the autophagy pathway is one of these. While this lysosomal degradation pathway can lead to degradation of viral components, acting as an intrinsic antiviral defense mechanism, many viruses either block autophagy or exploit it for their own replication (Dong and Levine, 2013; Dreux and Chisari, 2010; Richards and Jackson, 2013; Sumpter and Levine, 2011) . As a critical regulator in both the early and late steps of autophagy, Beclin1 has emerged as a prime target for different viruses, such as influenza virus, HIV, and herpes viruses (Munz, 2011) . However, targeting Beclin1 by a positive-strand RNA virus has not been reported. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large group of positivestrand RNA viruses that replicate in cytoplasm of host cells but don't induce high level of IFN products Devaraj et al., 2007; Zhou and Perlman, 2007) . These viruses induce the formation of cytoplasmic double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) which are believed to be the site for assembly of viral transcription-replication complexes (Gosert et al., 2002; Hagemeijer et al., 2010; Knoops et al., 2008; Snijder et al., 2006) . The origin of DMVs remains obscure, but these structures are often decorated with an autophage marker, LC3 (Bernasconi et al., 2012; Maier and Britton, 2012; Maier et al., 2013) . Although coronavirus infections are known to be accompanied with activation of autophagy (Cottam et al., 2011; Knoops et al., 2008; Prentice et al., 2004; Reggiori et al., 2010) , relatively little is known about the role autophagy may play in the coronavirus life cycle, as are the mechanisms of autophagy induction and its contribution(s) to viral regulation of host responses, especially those concerning innate immunity. Overall, these aspects have been under intense investigation, and new knowledge stemmed from such studies hold the key(s) to a better understanding of coronvirus pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Previously, it has been shown that the papain-like protease (PLP) domains contained in the nonstructural protein (nsp) 3 of coronaviruses of SARS-CoV , HCoV-NL63 and porcine epidemic diarrhea Virus (PEDV) (Xing et al., 2013) act as IFN antagonists. Several mechanisms have been proposed. First, the SARS-CoV PLpro forms a complex with IRF3 and blocks IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation . Second, SARS-CoV PLP and PLP2 of HCoV-NL63 and PEDV also interact with and impede the dimerization of stimulator of IFN genes (STING, a.k.a, MITA/ MPYS/ERIS) . Third, the aforementioned coronavirus PLPs possess de-ubiquitinating activity, which may also contribute to the ability of these PLPs to disrupt host innate immunity by removing ubiquitin moieties from signaling molecules in the innate antiviral pathways (Bibeau-Poirier and Servant, 2008; Chen, 2012; Loo and Gale, 2011) . Given that autophagy is increasingly implicated in virus-host interactions and activation of this pathway is dependent on ubiquitin-like reactions, we set out to determine whether PLP impacts on autophagy. Our data show that the membraneassociated PLP2 (PLP2-TM) of HCoV-NL63 and PEDV and PLpro-TM of SARS-CoV and the new-emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) represent a novel class of viral proteins encoded by coronaviruses that induce autophagy. Interestingly, we found that PLP2-TM induces incomplete autophagy, leading to accumulation of autophagosomes while impairing the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Intriguingly, PLP2-TM was found to associate with LC3 and Beclin1, two critical components of the autophagy pathway, and knockdown of Beclin1 partially reversed the blockade of PLP2-TM on innate immune signaling to the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. The PLP-TM targeting of Beclin1 to control autophagic activity may represent a novel mechanism of coronaviral regulation of antiviral innate immunity.",

HEK293T cells were co-transfected with an eGFP-LC3Bexpressing plasmid and the V5 eiptope-tagged PLP2-TM. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed, immunostained using an anti-V5 antibody, and examined for PLP expression and evidence of autophagosome formation by confocal fluorescence microscopy. As a positive control, cells transfected with eGFP-LC3B for 48 h were treated with Rapamycin, a wellknown autophagy inducer, for 6 h. eGFP-LC3 fluorescence microscopy is a well-accepted method of monitoring autophagosome formation, as measured by a change in the eGFP-LC3 fluorescence pattern from diffuse to punctate distribution (Klionsky et al., 2012) . As shown in Fig. 1B and Fig. 1C , HEK293T cells had very low basal autophagic activity, with less than 5% of cells exhibiting punctate eGFP-LC3. Shortterm treatment with Rapamycin efficiently induced autophagy, resulting in eGFP-LC3 puncta formation in \u223c40% of cells. Ectopic expression of PLP2-TM caused a clear redistribution of eGFP-LC3B to punctate structures, indicative of formation of autophagosomes (Fig. 1B) . Quantitative analysis revealed that while \u223c60% of cells expressing PLP2-TM exhibited eGFP-LC3 punctation (Fig. 1C) . These results suggest that besides the deubiquitinase (DUB) activity and IFN antagonist (Barretto et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2007; Clementz et al., 2010; Devaraj et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2012a) , the PLP2-TM encoded by human coronavirus NL63 is a novel autophagy-inducer.",

To further validate the finding that PLP2-TM promotes autophagy, we measured the expression levels of endogenous LC3-I and LC3-II in cells following expression of PLP2-TM, in comparison with cells expressing the control vector, by Western blotting. Consistent with the eGFP-LC3 fluorescence and TEM data, ectopic expression of PLP2-TM substantially increased the abundance of LC3-II in HEK293T (Fig. 2C) , HeLa (Fig. 2D ) and MCF-7 (Fig. 2E ) cells. Collectively, these data confirm that the induction of autophagy by PLP2-TM is not a cell-type specific phenomenon. It is of interest to point out that the basal levels of endogenous LC3-II were higher in HeLa cells than in HEK293T cells, an observation which was in agreement with the data on eGFP-LC3 punctation (Fig. 2B ).",

            "text": "As with HCoV-NL63 PLP2-TM, the PLpro-TM of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV PLpro-TM and PLP2-TM of PEDV also possess de-ubiquitinating and interferon antagonism activities Devaraj et al., 2007; Xing et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014) . The finding that PLP2-TM of HCoV-NL63 induces autophagy prompted us to investigate whether the PLP2-TM homologues encoded by other coronaviruses also have a similar function. Western blotting was carried out to determine the expression of LC3-I and LC3-II in HEK293T cells ectopically expressing various coronaviral PLPs Fig. 3 ). Although its effect was less pronounced, expression of the MERS-CoV PLpro-TM also caused substantial increase in LC3-II expression (lane 4, Fig. 3A ). Next, to determine if the protease activity of PLP2 is required for its induction of autophagy, NL63 PLP2-TM and its catalytic mutants (C1678A, H1836A and D1849A) (Fig. 1A) were transfected into HEK293T cells and the conversion from the cytosolic, soluble form, LC3-I, to the membrane-bound form was detected. We found that, like as the PLP2-TM, ectopic expression of all the catalytic mutants substantially increased the abundance of LC3-II, indicating that the catalytic activity is not required for induction of autophagy by PLP2-TM. Collectively, these results imply that the ability to promote autophagy is a shared attribute of coronavirus PLP2-TM and its homologs in a protease-independent manner. In subsequent investigations, we focused our efforts on using HCoV-NL63 PLP2-TM to delineate the molecular details underlying interactions of coronaviral PLP with the autophagy pathway. illustrating coronavirus NL63 genome, polyprotein (pp) 1a/b, the predicted processing of replicase polyproteins (pp) to nsp's. The domains, including the predicted transmembrane (TM), in nsp3, and the membrane anchored-PLP2 construct (PLP2-TM) that were used in this study are indicated. (B) PLP2-TM is a novel autophagy-inducing protein encoded by coronavirus. The plasmid of HCoV-NL63 PLP2-TM-V5 was co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-eGFP-LC3B into HEK2923T cells. As the positive control for induction of autophagy, HEK293T cells were transfected with eGFP-LC3B for 48 h and then treated with complete medium supplemented with 400 nmol/L Rapamycin for 6 h. The immunofluoresence of the cells were detected using a confocal microscope after stained with anti-V5-tagged primary antibody, followed by being stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The localization of eGFP-LC3B positive autophagosome accumulation (green) and the V5-tagged PLPs products (anti-V5, red) was visualized using a confocal microscope. (C) Quantification of cells displaying eGFP-LC3B puncta in PLP2-TM transfected cells. HEK 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with eGFP-LC3B and PLP2-TM-expression constructs. Forty-eight hours later, cells with eGFP-LC3B puncta formation were quantificated under a fluorescence confocal microscope. Three random fields, each containing at least 80 cells, were counted. Results from one representative experiment are shown in Fig. 1B . (D) PLP2-TM induces autophagosome-like structures detected using a transmission electron microscope. HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or PLP2-TM-V5 for 48 h and then cells were analyzed for autophagosome formation using a transmission electron microscope. The cells treated by 400 nmol/L Rapamycin were analyzed to serve as a positive control for induction of autophagy. Red arrows indicate representative autophagosome-like structures.

Significant eGFP-LC3B puncta formation was observed in cytoplasm of PLP2-TM-transfected cells as early as 24 h post transfection (Fig. 4A) , when PLP2-TM protein was first detected (Fig. 4C ). In addition, eGFP-LC3B puncta steadily increased at 48 h post transfection ( Fig. 4A and 4B), concomitant with an increase in PLP2-TM expression levels (Fig. 4C ). Approximately 40% of cells displayed cytoplasmic eGFP-LC3B puncta at 24 h postransfection, and that number climbed to >70% at 48 h ( Fig. 4B ). In contrast, cells co-transfected with control vector exhibited largely diffuse eGFP-LC3B fluorescence, with less than 7% of cells having background levels of eGFP-LC3B puncta, regardless of the time points monitored (at either 24 or 48 h post transfection, Fig. 4A and 4B). In line with these data, the abundance of endogenous LC3-II protein was reproducibly upregulated in a time-dependent manner in cells transfected with PLP2-TM ( Fig. 4C and Fig. 4D ), a phenomenon which was not observed with cells transfected with the control vector (data not shown). The increase in LC3-II protein levels by PLP2-TM, however, was substantially reduced in cells treated with 3-MA ( Fig. 4E and 4F), an autophagy inhibitor , providing additional support for the notion that PLP2-TM increases cellular autophagic activity. In aggregate, the time-dependent increase in eGFP-LC3B puncta formation and upregulation of LC3-II abundance in PLP2-TM-transfected cells but not in control vector-expressing cells confirms that the heightened autophagic activity results specifically from PLP2-TM expression.",

To answer this question, we measured the protein levels of a wellcharacterized autophagic substrate, p62/SQSTM1, which binds to LC3 and is specifically degraded as a result of complete autophagic flux (Bjorkoy et al., 2005; Pankiv et 5A ). These data reveal that PLP2-TM induces incomplete autophagy, with a disconnection between autophagosome accumulation and autophagic cargo hydrolysis, implying that PLP2-TM may interfere with the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes or impair the autolysosomal degradation.",

This reporter construct encodes a fusion protein composed of three open reading frames (ORFs), i.e., mRFP, GFP and LC3 (Amino-to Carboxyl-terminal order). In transfected cells, when autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes, the GFP-green fluorescence of the mRFP-GFP-LC3 fusion protein is quenched in the acidic autolysosomal environment, while red fluorescence emitted from mRFP (which is relatively acid-resistant) remains. By contrast, when fusion of mRFP-GFP-LC3-autophagosomes with lysosomes is interrupted, the mRFP-GFP-LC3-autophagosomes emit both green GFP-and red mRFP-fluorescences which colocalize as yellow puncta in merged fluorescent images (Tang et al., 2013) (Fig. 5B ). Validating this reporter system in our hands, we first showed that Rapamycin treated, mRFP-GFP-LC3expressing cells which underwent complete autophagic flux indeed exhibited predominant red fluorescence with only dim green fluorescence (Fig. 5C ). In contrast, cells coexpressing PLP2-TM and mRFP-GFP-LC3 displayed strong accumulation of mRFP-GFP-LC3-puncta which emitted colocalized red and green fluorescence (shown as yellow puncta in merged images, Fig. 5C ). The fluorescence pattern of mRFP-GFP-LC3 in PLP2-TM-expressing cells closely resembled that of cells treated with cholorquine (Fig. 5C) , a potent inhibitor of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. These findings indicate that PLP2-TM may impair the autophagosome maturation process by interfering with its fusion with lysosomes.",

In our efforts to further delineate the mechanisms underlying the induction of autophagy by PLP2-TM, we explored the possibility that PLP2-TM may physically associate with LC3, thereby regulating LC3-mediated phagophore elongation/closure. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed PLP2-TM substantially co-localized with eGFP-LC3 as cytoplasmic puncta in cotransfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 6A, left panels) , indicating that PLP2-TM is in close proximity with LC3 on autophagosome membranes. This was not a cell-type specific phenomenon, as it was also observed in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6A, right panels) . Coimmunoprecipation analyses showed that V5-tagged PLP2-TM formed a complex with endogenously expressed LC3 (Fig. 6B) . Interestingly, significantly more LC3-II than LC3-I As the positive control for induction of autophagy, HEK293T cells were treated with complete medium supplemented with 400 nmol/L Rapamycin for 6 h. The cells were then lysed for Western blotting analysis using a rabbit anti-LC3 antibody to detect endogenous LC3 expression (top panel in Fig. 3A ). The whole cell lysate (WCL) was blotted using anti-V5 antibodies to evaluate expression of PLP2 (PLpro)-TM (middle panel in Fig. 3A) , and \u03b2-Actin was detected in whole cell lysate (WCL) as a loading control (bottom panel in Fig. 3A ). (B) PLP2-TM-V5 and the catalytic mutants (C1678A, H1836A and D1849A) as showed in Fig. 1A were transfected respectively into HEK2923T, and induction of autophagy was detected as described in Fig. 3A .",

Furthermore, PLP2-TM physically interacted with endogenous Beclin1 (Fig. 7B , lane 2 in top panel), suggesting that Beclin1 expressed at physiologic levels also forms a complex with PLP2-TM.

In control siRNA transfected cells, activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter by the constitutively active RIG-I CARD (RIG-IN) was ablated by PLP2-TM. This was in line with our previous publications Devaraj et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2012a) . We found that knock-down of Be-clin1 slightly and not significantly increased the IFNbeta-Luc reporter activity when cotransfected with vector. Remarkably, knockdown of Beclin1 partially, but significantly reversed PLP2-TM blocking RIG-IN-activated IFN expression (Fig. 8A) . Immunoblotting demonstrated that Beclin1 siRNA efficiently depleted the target without affecting PLP2-TM expression (Fig. 8B) . Similarly, activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter by STING was inhibited by PLP2-TM in control siRNA transfected cells. However, knockdown of Beclin1 partially, but significantly reversed the inhibition that induced by PLP2-TM (Fig. 8C) . The data was also showed that Beclin1 siRNA efficiently knocked down the target of Beclin1 without affecting PLP2-TM expression (Fig. 8D ). Next, we tested how silencing of Beclin1 affected coronavirus replication. To achieve this goal, we took advantage of a Vero cell culture model for PEDV, the PLP2-TM of which also promotes autophagy (Fig. 3A) . While transfection of a control siRNA had no impact on M protein expression in PEDV infected cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Beclin1 significantly diminished M protein production ( Fig. 8E and 8F ). Taken together, these data suggest that coronaviral PLP2-TM exploits Beclin1 and the autophagy pathway to attenuate innate antiviral responses and concomitantly facilitate viral replication.",

A number of studies have shown that autophagy is induced during infections by various coronaviruses, although controversial results have been reported concerning whether autophagy is required for coronavirus replication (de Haan and Reggiori, 2008; Prentice et al., 2004; Reggiori et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2007) . At present, the underlying mechanisms by which coronaviruses promote autophagy are poorly understood. The nsp6 encoded by infectious bronchitis virus, an avian coronavirus, was recently reported to induce autophagosome formation, as were the nsp6 homologues encoded by MHV, SARS-CoV and the closely related arterivirus PRRSV (Cottam et al., 2011) . We present evidence in this study that expression of the membrane-anchored coronavirus papainlike protease PLP2 domain (and its homologues) alone is capable of activating autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions, assigning a novel function to this multifunctional viral protein which is known to act as a viral protease, a DUB enzyme, and an IFN antagonist (Barretto et al., 2005; Chen et al., Fig. 8E was measured by densitometric analysis using ImageJ software and then the ratio of M protein/\u03b2-actin was calculated.

Importantly, we have demonstrated this in multiple cell types (HEK293T, HeLa and MCF-7), and shown it to be an attribute shared by PLP2-TM/PLpro-TM of different coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and PEDV. This finding uncovers a previously unappreciated role for PLP2-TM/PLpro-TM in regulation of autophagy by coronaviruses and may provide novel insights into the mechanisms of coronavirus pathogenesis. Our data show that the PLP2 domain and the downstream hydrophobic TM motif are both needed to promote autophagy. Neither PLP2 nor TM alone is sufficient, as evidenced by the inabilities of soluble PLP2 and PLP1-TM to induce autophagosome (LC3 puncta) formation (Data not shown). Mechanistically, we found that PLP2-TM physically interacted with Beclin1 and LC3, both of which are involved in the early steps of autophagosome formation (Kraft and Martens, 2012; Mehrpour et al., 2010) . Interestingly, our data also reveal that PLP2-TM induces incomplete autophagy that does not culminate in autophagosome maturation to autolysosomes. Evidence supporting this notion came from the experiments showing that degradation of the autophagic substrate p62/SQSTM1 was retarded and that the autolysosome-liable GFP fluorescence of the mRFP-GFP-LC3 reporter protein was not lost in spite of enhanced LC3 lipidation. Beclin1, again, is likely the target responsible for the deficient autophagosome maturation in PLP2-TM expressing cells, given its involvement in the UVRAG-containing PI3K complex that controls fusion between autophagosmes and lysosomes (Kang et al., 2011; Liang et al., 2008) . Of note, accumulating evidence suggests that Beclin1 is a prime target for viruses that manipulate the autophagy pathway (Munz, 2011) . For example, Influenza A virus M2 and HIV Nef bind to Beclin1 to hamper the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (Gannage et al., 2009; Kyei et al., 2009) . We propose that the coronavirus PLP2-TM adopts a similar strategy to impede the maturation of autophagic vacuoles. However, the precise mechanism will need to be further studied. Regardless, the induction of incomplete as opposed to complete autophagy by PLP2-TM may represent an evolutionary advantage of the virus, in that it prevents autophagic degradation of viral products generated in infected cells, promoting maximal viral survival.",

A tempting hypothesis is that autophagy may facilitate viral propagation, as demonstrated for other positive-strand RNA viruses such as dengue virus, and Poliovirus (Richards and Jackson, 2013) . However, experimental evidence concerning whether autophagy is required for replication of coronaviruses has been contradictory. While earlier studies suggested autophagy to play a role (Cottam et al., 2011; Prentice et al., 2004) , several latest reports argued against it (Maier and Britton, 2012; Maier et al., 2013; Reggiori et al., 2010) . These recent studies support a model in which MHV and arterivirus EAV hijack the LC3-I-positive EDEMsomes, rather than autophagosome membranes, to form the DMVs in which viral replication takes place (Monastyrska et al., 2013; Reggiori et al., 2010) . However, the possibility that different coronaviruses may have a disparate requirement for autophagy for optimal viral replication cannot be ruled out. Supporting this notion, several studies have shown that autophagy is induced by infection with a closely related arterivirus, PRRSV, whose replication is crippled by inhibition of autophagy Liu et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012b) . We show here that knockdown of the master regulator of autophagy, Beclin1, impairs PEDV M protein production. Clearly, more studies with a greater number of different coronaviruses are warranted (Maier and Britton, 2012) .",

We have previously shown that coronavirus PLpro-TM/PLP2-TM negatively regulates antiviral defenses by inhibiting the activation of IRF3 Devaraj et al., 2007) , and that the PLPs disrupt STING-mediated IFN induction , but the mechanism(s) by which coronavirus PLPs target STING (and possibly other signaling molecules) to inhibit IRF3-dependent antiviral response is unknown. In this work, we have demonstrated that PLP2-TM promotes the interaction of STING with Be-clin1, but not with LC3 (data not shown), suggesting that PLP2-TM may sequester STING to autophagosomes through Beclin1, thereby inhibiting downstream innate immune signaling. Although not tested in this study, PLP2-TM-induced autophagy may also segregate other innate immune signaling components and perhaps even viral dsRNAs from ligation to cytoplasmic viral sensors. Supporting the exploit of Beclin1 and autophagy for viral immune escape, we found that knockdown of Beclin1 (and thus autophagosome formation) partially but significantly reversed the blockade of PLP2-TM on activation of the IFN response. The reason the relief was only partial was likely due to incomplete depletion of Beclin1 and existence of autophagy-independent immune evasion mechanisms, as exemplified by the deubiquitination of RIG-I, TRAF3, etc. by PLPs .",

Beclin1 is required for the PLP2-TM negative regulation of IFN expression and contributes to coronavirus replication. (A, C) HEK 293T cells were mock transfected or transfected with control-siRNA, and Beclin1-siRNA at a concentration of 100 nmol/L for 24 h, and then the cells were transfected with IFN\u03b2-luc reporter, pRL-TK, with expressing construct of RIG-IN (A) or STING (C) or empty vector and PLP2-TM for another 24 h. Cells were incubated for 48 h and firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed. The results were expressed as mean relative luciferase (firefly luciferase activity divided by Renilla luciferase activity) with a standard deviation from repeated experiments carried out in triplicate. For statistical analysis, the data of Vector or PLP2-TM between Beclin1 siRNA and control siRNA were subjected to unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test using the Microsoft SPSS 12.0 software, and a P value < 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant difference. (B and D) Proteins were extracted from the cells inFig. 8A(B) or Fig. 8C (D) and analyzed using Western blotting with an anti-Beclin1 antibody to visualize Beclin1 proteins (top panel) and anti-V5 antibody (second panel) to visualize the PLP2-TM construct expression. Anti-Flag (B) and anti-HA (D) antibodies were used to visualize RIG-IN and STING proteins (third panel). Beta-actin was detected using Western blotting as protein loading control (bottom panel). (E) Beclin1-siRNA reduces PEDV replication in Vero cells. Vero cells were transfected with either Beclin1 siRNA or control siRNA at a concentration of 100 nmol/L for 24 h, and then the cells were treated by PEDV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for another 24 h. Cells were incubated for 48 h and the M protein expressions were assayed using Western blotting assay. (F) The optical density of M protein band in",
