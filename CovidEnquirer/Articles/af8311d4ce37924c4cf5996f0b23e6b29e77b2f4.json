The acronym has been common in fire services, emergency medical services (EMS), and the military for quite some time. Essentially, PPE helps to ensure that individuals are safe from physical hazards that they may encounter in their work environment. PPE may be used to protect workers from general environmental threats (e.g., temperature extremes and noise), specific work-related threats (e.g., industrial equipment and falls from elevated work areas), or threats faced in an emergency situation (e.g., hazardous chemical and infectious agents). No equipment is appropriate for all individuals and threats: rather, equipment must be selected and properly used according to the setting of use and the level of risk.",

In March 1995, a crude form of the nerve agent sarin was released in the Tokyo subway system on separate cars bound for a common downtown station. This attack resulted in 12 deaths and more than 4000 persons presenting to the hospital for medical evaluation. None of the casualties was decontaminated before treatment or transport. Retrospectively, 135 prehospital and 100 hospital personnel reported symptoms consistent with nerve agent exposure. Fortunately, none required emergency treatment. 1 Eleven physicians caring for the sickest victims (including one in cardiac arrest and one in respiratory arrest) were most affected, and six of them required treatment with specific antidote. All recovered fully and did not have to cease their patient care efforts because of symptoms. 2 Approximately 80% of victims selfreferred to hospitals, which is consistent with U.S. experiences, indicating that few victims of chemical contamination events undergo decontamination before arrival at a medical facility. 3, 4 This has caused most jurisdictions to reconsider historical plans that contaminated patients would not be in contact with medical care personnel until they were \"clean.\" EMS and hospital personnel need to be prepared for contaminated patients presenting directly to them and recognize that in certain situations PPE may be required to safely provide care.",

            "text": "SARS posed unique risks and challenges to health care workers. This novel viral agent with incompletely defined transmission characteristics was controlled in 2002, with aggressive quarantine measures and use of PPE. In the first wave of SARS in Toronto, 79.2% of all cases were acquired in a health care setting. 5 Aggressive use of PPE, including N95 masks, barrier precautions, and gloves, was generally effective at preventing spread, although during one difficult and prolonged intubation attempt, at least 6 providers contracted SARS from a patient, despite complying with PPE recommendations. 6 This case led to recommendations that higher levels of PPE may be required during procedures that are likely to generate aerosols or provoke coughing, such as intubation, airway suctioning, positive pressure ventilation, and nebulized treatments. 7 Many of the lessons learned from the SARS epidemic, including the importance of appropriate respiratory PPE and compliance programs, were later applied to the 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic. Even so, H1N1 took a toll on health care workers, and analysis of both of these events has led to future improvements for disaster preparedness. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the RAND Corporation produced a comprehensive \"lessons learned\" report, summarizing issues from the 2001 terrorist bombings at the World Trade Center (WTC), anthrax incidents, and the 1995 Oklahoma City Murrah Federal Building Bombing. The report, titled Protecting Emergency Responders: Lessons Learned from Terrorist Attacks, describes in detail many of the challenges responders faced (Box 46-1). 13 It is clear from the WTC events that a large number of jurisdictions responding, conflicting messages regarding use of PPE and safety of the environment, unavailability of appropriate PPE, poor design characteristics of current PPE models, and lack of a plan to implement respiratory precautions can complicate a response and potentially place providers at risk. WTC responders continue to suffer respiratory symptoms attributable to exposures at \"ground zero.\" 14 ",

Hazard vulnerability analyses (HVA) are required for community emergency planning grants and are required of health care facilities that are accredited by The Joint Commission, previously known as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO). 15, 16 The HVA uses a numerical ranking of factors for specific threats (e.g., chemical release), including the risk of the event occurring, the current preparedness for the threat, and the risk to life. The numerical score determines the gravity of each threat to the community. Each community's HVA will reflect the unique risks that must be considered by its emergency responders. Choice of PPE may be affected by factors within the HVA, such as \u2022 Population density of the community and surrounding area \u2022 High-or moderate-risk terrorist targets in the community (e.g., government buildings, centers of commerce, or other symbolic sites) \u2022 Chemical hazards posed by community industry (e.g., use of cyanide and hydrofluoric acid in the electronics industry) \u2022 Risk of transportation incidents and major transportation routes, particularly highways and railroads \u2022 Proximity of health care facilities, schools, or other key locations to these potential targets and industrial and transportation hazards \u2022 Frequency of hazardous materials (HazMat) incidents in the community \u2022 Resources available to respond to HazMat incidents (e.g., rapid access to on-site decontamination may decrease, but not eliminate, contaminated persons leaving the scene)",

The EMS role in a HazMat event may vary depending on jurisdictional planning and the availability of resources. Fire services personnel may or may not be able to provide treatment in a \"warm zone\" (i.e., the area of reduced contamination outside of the immediate release zone) depending on their training. Nonfire-based EMS personnel may require PPE to triage and treat victims in the warm zone. In the event of a mass chemical exposure, victims will likely self-refer to visible ambulances, call for emergency assistance from locations removed from the site of release, or make their way to hospitals, by-passing organized EMS and fire services altogether. This movement of contamination on the bodies of patients essentially causes a \"migrating\" warm zone, resulting in contamination of previously clean (\"cold\") areas. This migrating contamination may require protective equipment for EMS responders and hospital personnel, and appropriate plans and equipment should be in place. The roles and responsibilities of the responders, as well as the equipment required, need to be defined and drilled in advance of an incident.",

            "text": "Even though HazMat releases seldom cause serious traumatic injury in the absence of concomitant explosions, the potential exists for both scene responders and hospital receivers to suffer serious consequences of exposure. The Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry (ATSDR) maintains a multistate voluntary accounting of hazardous substance releases. The National Toxic Substance Incidents Program (NTSIP), which replaced the Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) database in 2010, currently collects data from seven states on HazMat events. [17] [18] [19] From 1993 to 2001, 44,015 events were recorded in the database: 3455 (7.8%) of the incidents caused injuries, and 74% of victims were transported to a health care facility. 4 In another analysis of HSEES data, only 5% of victims required admission to a health care facility, with the vast majority of patients presenting with self-limited respiratory symptoms. 20 In 2011, the NTSIP reported 3128 separate incidents, resulting in 62 fatalities and an additional 1115 ill or injured patients. Carbon monoxide, chemicals for illicit methamphetamine production, paints/dyes, and petroleum products were the most common offending agents. A review of these events found that 344 of the patients were employees or first responders whose illness and injuries could have been prevented with appropriate PPE. 21 HSEES data from 2003 to 2006 shows that of 33,157 documented events, secondary contamination of facilities and providers occurred in 15 (0.05%) cases, resulting in illness in 17 providers. Of these secondary contamination victims, only two had employed any PPE when the contamination occured. 22 Even though secondary contamination events are relatively rare, they pose significant risk to health care providers and to the entire health care system because emergency departments and transport vehicles may be closed or taken out of service for proper decontamination. Events resulting in emergency department evacuation and/or provider illness are especially serious in situations of \"off-gassing,\" where toxic gases are released from contaminated patients and/or their clothing. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] The most serious of these incidents involve patients with suicidal ingestions of organophosphate pesticides. [23] [24] [25] Exposures to these patients have caused at least one provider to require intubation and receive aggressive treatment with specific antidote because of contact with pesticide in emesis and vapors during patient resuscitation. 23 Patients who have ingested organophosphate may \"off-gas\" for days and present an ongoing risk to health care workers. 25 In conjunction with the information from the Tokyo Subway Sarin Attack and the chemical terrorism risk posed by these agents, it is clear that these pesticides present a substantial risk of toxicity from secondary exposures.",

PPE must be selected on the basis that it does not impose unnecessary risks to the provider while at the same time offering an appropriate margin of safety against the hazard. Because the selection of PPE usually revolves around the selection of the respiratory component, various types of respirators must be reviewed. Each respirator has an assigned protection factor that reflects the degree of protection afforded to the user. Simply put, 1/protection factor equals the amount of exposure for the wearer. For example, a provider wearing a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) with an assigned protection factor (APF) of 1000 is exposed to 1/1000 the level of contaminant as compared with wearing no protection.",

This type of respirator is required for entry into environments where the identity of and/or the potential quantity of a hazardous substance are unknown or where the quantity of oxygen in the air is unknown. SCBA is the most common atmosphere-supplying respirator for emergency responses. It provides air via a tank, usually worn on the back. The operational time is limited by the capacity of the tank (usually less than 1 hour). Fire service personnel routinely use this form of respiratory protection, and fire-based EMS services personnel generally incorporate this PPE into their chemical protection planning. Limitations include the equipment's weight (approximately 25 to 30 pounds), cost, need for fit testing, duration of air supply, and need to refill air bottles. Even though SCBA provides excellent protection, its limitations make it inappropriate for many situations (e.g., caring for a patient with an infectious disease, providing hospital-based decontamination, or securing a perimeter in the warm zone). SCBA has an APF of about 10,000, the highest of any type of respirator. 38, 39 Supplied-air respirators (SARs) provide air via a hose line from a nearby clean air source (e.g., compressor or hospital supply line). To meet OSHA requirements for Level B, respirators must have a tightfitting face piece and an emergency supply of air in case of line failure or problems. 40 Loose-fitting hoods with a supplied-air source do not meet Level B standards but are used by some decontamination teams when an additional level of protection is desired because of institutional preference or local hazard profile. Advantages include a potentially unlimited supply of fresh air and longer duration of use. Limitations are primarily mobility and thus flexibility of response. These respirators are best suited to health care provider use in a decontamination room or well-defined area in which the air lines are unlikely to be tangled, stretched, or become a trip hazard. The APF of a typical tight-fitting face piece SAR is 1000, although there may be variability among models and designs (e.g., tight-fitting mask vs. loose-fitting hood). 38, 39 Air-Purifying Respirators Air-purifying respirators (APRs) have cartridges that filter the air in the user's environment to remove particulate matter and specific chemicals that the filter is designed to capture. These filters do not affect the oxygen concentration of the ambient air and thus cannot be used in potentially oxygen-deficient environments. Only those chemicals for which the filter is designated are removed. In addition, the capacity of the filter can be exceeded by large amounts of contaminant, thus these respirators are designed for situations in which the concentration of the agent is either established to be or assumed to be below the threshold for the canister. Nonpowered APRs use the wearer's work of breathing to pull ambient air through the filter. Examples include dust masks and military and civilian \"gas masks.\" The APF of a nonpowered full-face piece APR is 50 when appropriate quantitative fit testing is performed. 38, 39 Of note, this type of mask is used by military and tactical personnel for protection against dangerous lethal levels of nerve and other chemical agents. Advantages include low cost and long duration of use. Disadvantages include increased work of breathing and physiological stress, mask fogging, and the need for fit testing.",

Appropriate PPE for perimeter control and EMS warm-zone operations remain topics of debate at this time. Generally, suits should be sized far more generously than standard work clothing, to prevent tearing during squatting and other activities (e.g., an average-sized 70-kg man should plan to wear a size XXL suit). Many suit configurations are possible, and the optimal configuration will depend on the mission and other equipment in the ensemble. For example, suits without \"feet\" are preferred when worn with boots (to allow taping over the boot) but those with integrated bootie \"feet\" are preferred when pull-on \"sock\" type butyl booties are to be used.

Constant use of both contact and airborne precautions has generally been advised with the optional use of a PAPR rather than an N95 mask during \"high-risk\" interventions likely to generate aerosols or provoke coughing (e.g., suctioning, intubation, positive pressure ventilation). 6, 7 Patient care providers should have routine access to nonsterile examination gloves, barrier gowns that protect the arms and anterior torso, standard surgical (droplet) masks, and face shields that provide adequate splash protection (which may be integrated with the mask, a separate face shield, or goggles) according to the OSHA bloodborne pathogens standards. 47, 48 When needed, providers should have easy access to higher levels of protection. \"Precaution carts\" or \"Bad bug bags\" may be preassembled with appropriate gowns, gloves, face shields or goggles, N95 or PAPR respirators, and other supplies so that health care providers do not have to assemble the necessary components when hazards arise. Instruction sheets for donning or doffing and disinfection procedures can be included in these kits. 49, 48 Practitioners fitted for N95 respirators may use these for patient care, and others should have access to a PAPR until they can undergo fit testing for an N95 respirator. Plans to rapidly fit test additional employees during an event that might require prolonged use of airborne precautions (e.g., SARs) should be in place.",

There is experimentally developed PPE that are easier to don and doff, and which provide improved mobility and visibility to perform procedures. In one project completed at Brown University in conjunction with the Rhode Island School of Design, engineering and industrial design students paired up to develop a new model of Level B PPE that could be donned in half the time with a single user compared to two users with traditional PPE. Even though a prototype was developed and showcased, there were no clear funding sources available to bring this design to market. 54 Technology change is occurring far more rapidly than the current approvals process and new standards that have arisen in the wake of recent events. Clear guidance on appropriate technologies for warm-zone activities is lacking at this time. This can lead to confusion and difficult choices for agencies and facilities, knowing that their PPE selection may be either too much or too little to satisfy future standards. Currently, there is no recommendation or consensus on the level of PPE that is required for hospital-based personnel, much to the consternation of hospital preparedness leaders. Some have proposed a PPE Level H to meet this need. Additional research is clearly needed regarding safe but comfortable PPE, methods of decontamination, modeling of airborne concentrations of specific agents, and PPE selection.",
