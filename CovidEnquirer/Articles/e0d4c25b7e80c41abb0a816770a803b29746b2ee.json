N K cells are a heterogenous population of CD3 -, CD16`, CD56+ large granular lymphocytes (LGL)' capable of lysing a broad range of neoplastic, normal, and virus-infected cells in a non-MHC-restricted or antibodydependent manner (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [ADCC]) (1) . CD16 is a low affinity receptor for the Fc fragment of IgG (Fc-yRIII) (2) and represents one of the most important signal transduction structures capable of activating the NK cell functional program (1) . NK cells mainly circulate in the peripheral blood, and also can be found under physiologic and inflammatory conditions in several nonlymphoid tissues, including lung interstitium (3), intestinal mucosa (4), and liver (5) . This recirculation pattern indicates that they interact with endothelial cells, as well as with several extracellular matrix (ECM) components .",

Anti-c& mAb immunoprecipitated two proteins migrating at 140 and 110 kD under nonreducing conditions corresponding to the a6 and (31 subunits, respectively. Both proteins migrated at 130 kD under reducing conditions. Adhesion of NK Cells to LM Is Mediated by VLA-6. To determine whether VLA-6 present on NK cells is a functional Figure 3 . Immunochemical analysis of VLA-6 expressed on human NK cells. 125 1-labeled human NK cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with control rabbit anti-mouse Ig (lanes 1 and 5), AlA5 (anti-/31) mAb (lanes 2 and 6), control rabbit anti-rat Ig (lanes 3 and 7), or GoH3 (anti-a6) mAb (lanes 4 and 8), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing (NR) and reducing (R) conditions . 1253 Gismondi et al. receptor, we analyzed the ability of NK cells to bind to LMcoated surfaces . \"Cr-labeled human NK cells were incubated on LM-coated plates for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence of different doses of GoH3 (anti-cx6) mAb, or a saturating dose of anti-01 antiserum . 10-15% of highly purified NK cells bound specifically to different doses of LM (1-50 N.g/ml) and not to BSA (Fig. 4 A) , and this adhesion was completely blocked by anti-01 antiserum and, in a dose-dependent manner, by anti-a6 mAb . Control antibodies such as anti-MHC I (W6/32) mAb were not inhibitory (Fig. 4 B) . These data indicate that NK cells adhere to LM and that this adhesion is mediated by VLA-6 . Activation ofNK Cells by CD16-crosslinking or Phorbol Esters Increases Adhesion to LM We have investigated whether stimuli able to trigger several NK cell functions can modulate their adhesion to LM . \"Cr-labeled NK cells were treated for different times at 37\u00b0C with TPA (10 ng/ml) or, in a more physiologically relevant manner, with anti-CD16 mAb. As shown in Fig . 5 A, activation of NK cells with TPA or by crosslinking of CD16 antigen with saturating doses of B73 .1 or 3G8, two mAb directed against different epitopes of this molecule, resulted in enhanced adhesion to LM. Similar results were observed when NK cells were stimulated with 3G8 F(ab')2 fragments . Enhanced adhesion was already observed 10 min after treatment and remained at the same levels over the stimulation period (30 min) (Fig. 5 B) . VLA-6 Mediates Activation-dependent Adhesion to LM To investigate whether increased adhesion to LM induced by NK cell activation was mediated by VLA-6, we performed the binding assay in the presence of anti-c16 or anti-01 antibodies. Both anti-a6 and anti-01 antibodies but not control mAb (anti-MHC I) completely blocked adhesion of TPAor B73.1stimulated NK cells to LM (Fig. 6) . These data indicate that, as for constitutive adhesion to LM, the increased LM binding of stimulated NK cells is exclusively mediated by VLA-6 .",

The rapid enhancement of NK cell adhesion to LM upon activation occurs without changes in the levels of cell surface expression of VLA6 and the other (31 LMR (data not shown), as previously described for activated T lymphocytes (10), suggesting that a qualitative alteration of integrin is more likely responsible for enhanced adhesiveness .

Increased avidity for counter ligands as a result of cell activation is a behavior common to many integrin receptors (7) . Nevertheless, the molecular basis of enhanced integrin function is largely unknown . Quantitative changes in cell surface integrin expression appear not to be particularly relevant, as indicated by the failure to demonstrate increased receptor levels accompanying increased binding in many different systems (10, 11, 22) and also in our study. Therefore qualitative changes, i.e., posttranslational modifications of either a and/or /3 integrin subunits, as well as of other integrin-associated molecules such as cytoskeleton components, are likely to occur. Among the possible posttranslational modifications, phosphorylation appears to be a good candidate as a mechanism regulating integrin receptor functions because of its reversible nature. Cytoplasmic domains of a and a subunits have been shown to be substrates of kinase activities . Neverthe-less, changes in integrin avidity are not always associated with their phosphorylation, and in some cases they appear to be induced instead by nonproteic components (23, 24) .",

In the 02 family, all three a subunits are constitutively phosphorylated in PMN and monocytes (28) , but this phosphorylation does not appear to play, at least for \u00abL, any functional role. In the VLA family, a subunit phosphorylation correlates with the high avidity state of integrin receptor. Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of cx6 subunit and its association to increased adhesion to LM has been observed in our study and in activated murine macrophages (11) . c16 phosphorylation suggests an important functional role of a subunit cytoplasmic domain in affinity regulation of integrin receptors. Supporting this idea, recent evidence show that affinity of cilIbO3 is modulated by the cytoplasmic domain of celIb subunit (29) . Indeed, its truncation resulted in increased affinity for fibrinogen similar to that observed after exogenous platelet activation . Overall, it can be hypothesized that a sequence in the cytoplasmic domain of ot subunit may maintain integrin receptor in a low affinity conformation, likely interacting with an intracellular moiety with \"repressor\" activity. Modification of this interaction, which can be induced by cytoplasmic domain truncation or phosphorylation, as shown in our study and by Shaw et al .

In this regard, LM has been found to facilitate NK cell migration in response to several chemotactic stimuli (30) . The activation-dependent increase in VLA-6-mediated NK cell adhesion to LM may be relevant to temporarily immobilize NK cells at the site of ongoing inflammatory or immune responses, and prevent them from escaping into the circulation .",
