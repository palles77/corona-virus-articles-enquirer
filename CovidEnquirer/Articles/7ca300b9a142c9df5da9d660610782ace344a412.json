Therefore correlations between L-lactate concentrations and measures of BC were investigated in healthy horses and ponies. In ponies, the influence of endocrine status on L-lactate concentrations was also investigated. Blood samples were obtained from 101 ponies and 51 horses. Breed, weight, height, measures of BC and L-lactate concentrations were recorded. In ponies, triglyceride and ACTH concentrations were measured and an oral glucose test performed. Correlations between L-lactate and BC parameters were established. The association between L-lactate concentrations, equid type (pony or horse), BC, age, and glucose concentrations was investigated in a multivariable model. Weak (P = 0.001) negative correlations were detected between L-lactate concentration and the average BC score (r = \u22120.29), heart girth: height ratio (r = \u22120.27) and age (r = \u22120.27).",

Hospitalized horses are typically discharged within a few days of admission and subsequent detection of shedding, which increases concerns regarding transmission and prevention in home settings. In order to make best-practice, evidence-based recommendations regarding management of individual horses and populations, we must understand the duration of shedding among affected horses, a vital part of the epidemiology of Salmonella in equine populations. To that end, the objectives of this study were to, 1) characterize the duration of Salmonella shedding among culture-positive horses, 2) describe factors associated with shedding duration, and 3) investigate adverse effects created by exposure of Salmonella-positive horses to their stablemates.",

Typically, a transverse tear in the aorta occurs near the remnant of the ligamentum arteriosum, with formation of a fistula towards the pulmonary artery. The fistulation often is a relatively long and irregular shaped tract. A wide range of clinical signs may occur. Tachycardia and right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension are usually present. Often a holosystolic and early diastolic murmur are found dorsal to the aortic valve area. Obtaining good quality cardiac ultrasound images may be challenging in some Friesians due to their body conformation. The purpose of this study was to describe how to take diagnostic ultrasound images of APF, applicable in equine practice. Data from 9 Friesian geldings and 3 mares (mean body weight 591 AE 54 kg) were included. Age ranged from 4 to 12 years (median 5.8). All horses underwent a full echocardiographic exam including 2D, M-mode and color flow Doppler. In addition, specific views were acquired to visualize the APF. All horses showed ultrasound changes compatible with severe pulmonary hypertension and a decrease in aortic size. From the right parasternal left ventricular outflow tract view and right ventricular (RV) inflow-outflow view (Figure 1 ), APF could be visualized in the triangle between right atrium (RA), aorta (Ao) and pulmonary artery (PA) in 8 horses, but lesions were sometimes subtle. Color flow examination from these views did show abnormal flow suggestive for APF in 6 horses. One horse showed an aortic dissection with a circular pseudo-aneurism (cuff) of the entire visible aorta. Left-sided long-axis views of the PA from the third intercostal space were superior to visualize the APF. With cranial (45 ) and slight dorsal (10 ) treatment and after 4 weeks of treatment. A further gastroscopic examination was performed at 2 weeks in IO horses. Anonymised gastroscopy images were reviewed blind to details of treatment.

After 7 days of acclimation, calves were examined by clinical respiratory score (RS) and lung ultrasound score (USS); 30 calves with a normal RS and USS were selected for bacterial challenge. On the day before the challenge, a deep NP swab was collected. The next day, calves were sedated and a video laryngoscope was used to pass a catheter into the distal trachea; 25 mL of 10 10 CFU/mL P. multocida was administered. Calves were monitored at intervals by RS and USS; when USS showed significant consolidation, a second deep NP swab was collected and calves were randomized to receive either ampicillin trihydrate (n = 17, label dose x 3 days) or an equal volume and duration of sterile saline (n = 11). Two calves did not develop significant lung consolidation following bacterial challenge, so they were not included in the treatment randomization. Calves were monitored daily via RS and USS for 14 days. On day 14, a third deep NP swab was collected. Calves were then sedated and euthanized; postmortem samples of the NP tonsil, lung, and tracheobronchial lymph nodes were collected. NP swabs and tissue samples were stored in \u221280 C and were processed simultaneously.

The objective of this study was to continuously sample both a healthy and mastitic quarter from cows with naturally occurring mastitis to compare the drug concentrations of intramammary infusions of ceftiofur.

Lear -University of Tennessee, College of Veterinary Medicine; Marc Caldwell -University of Tennessee; Ky Pohler -Texas A & M University; Aaron Baumann -University of Tennessee Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flavivirdae family, is an emerging pathogen in humans. During gestation, ZIKV induces placental inflammation and insufficiency, limiting effective nutrient exchange and directly damages fetal tissues. The increasing spread of the virus along with lack of knowledge on mechanisms of viral pathogenesis have demonstrated a need to develop an appropriate animal model for pathogenesis investigation. The main objective of this study was to develop a relevant model to study the viral dynamics at the maternalfetal interface including fetal congenital abnormalities using sheep. Our research hypothesis was that pregnant sheep inoculated with ZIKV would be permissive to viral replication resulting in transmission to the developing fetus. In order to critically test this hypothesis, 12 pregnant ewes carrying 45-day fetus were enrolled in the study and randomly distributed between 3 treatment groups receiving intraamniotic (IA; n = 4), intravascular (IV; n = 4), and intravaginal (VA, n = 4) inoculation of 10 4 FFU of ZIKV strain PRVABC59. Clinical illness score was assessed daily. Blood was collected daily until 14 days post inoculation (dpi) and PCR performed to identify viremia in the dams. Transabdominal ultrasound was performed weekly, assessing fetal viability. Clinical illness was not observed in any sheep following inoculation. Following 7 dpi and 14 dpi, fetal wastage occurred in all sheep in the IA and IV group, respectively. Molecular techniques were performed, confirming ZIKV.

Binding of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) to its ligand (PD-L1) promotes activated T-cell exhaustion. Tumor cells (TCs) evade host's immune attack by expressing PD-L1 and stimulating PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Accumulation of intratumoral FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs) also results in effector T-cell inhibition and decreased anti-tumor response. Little is known about whether canine gliomas share these immunomodulating mechanisms.",

The most common IMs in humans are immune-mediated, and include polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis and inclusion body myositis. In dogs the immune-mediated IMs masticatory myositis, PM and myositis caused by infectious diseases, related dogs. Given the early onset of muscle weakness and presence of related affected dogs, an underlying genetic cause was suspected.Histopathology of skeletal muscle biopsies confirmed an inflammatory myopathy and immune-mediated, infectious or possibly dystrophic disorders were considered. Immunofluorescent staining was used to phenotype cellular infiltrates, determine if the major histocompatibility antigens MHC I and II were overexpressed, and for localization of the dystrophy associated protein dysferlin. A genome-wide association strategy was used to map a chromosomal locus to CFA36, followed by whole genome sequencing (WGS) that identified a homozygous L349P substitution in the SLC25A12 gene, encoding the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate transporter isoform (AGC1) most prominently expressed in the brain and muscle (heart and skeletal muscle).Transport studies performed by functionally reconstituting the recom-binant wild-type and mutant AGC1 in liposomes confirmed a dramatic decrease of AGC1 transport activity by the mutant carrier demonstrating pathogenicity of the variant. In addition, targeted, broadspectrum metabolomic analysis of skeletal muscle from affected dogs and controls demonstrated a proinflammatory milieu and strong experimental support for oxidative stress in affected dog muscles. This is the first description of a SLC25A12 variant associated with an IM in any species and the first report of an underlying mutation resulting in a metabolic defect associated with an IM. To date, 14 human inherited diseases associated with mitochondrial transporters of the SLC25 family have been reported that result in pure metabolic disorders including defective mitochondrial energy production, and well characterized biochemical and genetic defects. The reported diseases in humans are predominantly associated with the central nervous system and include developmental delay, congenital epilepsy, hypomyelination and possibly autism. The explanation for why muscle is primarily affected in dogs with the SLC25A12 variant will be the subject of future investigations.

Whittaker -Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine; Nicole Andre -Cornell University; Andrew Miler -Cornell University; Amy Glaser -Cornell University; Elizabeth Berliner -Cornell University Feline upper respiratory infection (URI) is an important infectious disease complex that affects the feline population, particularly those in densely-housed populations such as shelter and rescue facilities. Clinical signs include conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, and ocular discharge, as well as typical upper respiratory tract signs such as sneezing. Feline URIs are associated with a number of pathogens including feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), pneumovirus, Chlamydophila felis, Mycoplasma sp., Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. The role that feline coronavirus (FCoV) has as a primary causative agent of feline URI is not entirely clear. Here, we collected swabs from the conjunctiva and nasal cavity of cats diagnosed with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), as well as from the conjunctiva, and nasal and ororphangeal tissue of healthy cats and cats experiencing clinical signs associated with URI's. FCoV was detected in the conjunctival, nasal, and oropharygeal regions in cats displaying differing degrees of respiratory signs and detected within FIP cats upon necropsy. The nasal turbinates of an FIP cat were examined histologically and had multifocal regions of pyogranulomatous inflammation. Using immunohistochemistry, FCoV antigen was detected within macrophages in the areas of inflammation. These observations support respiratory tract infection due to FCoV and suggest that FCoV may be an under-recognized cause of feline URI.

A mandatory confinement order for infected dogs was issued by Public Health as part of one cluster. CIV was contained in each cluster and apparently eradicated. The largest cluster was eradicated in April 2018. CIV was not identified in Canada again until October 2018, when another cluster was associated with importation of dogs from Asia. This cluster was eradicated quickly and no further CIV diagnoses were made from November 2018 to the time of writing.",

Finno -University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine; Victor Rivas -UC Davis; Nathan Slovis -Hagyard Equine Medical Institute; K. Gary Magdesian -UC Davis Clinical signs of idiopathic hypocalcemia in Thoroughbred (TB) foals include hypocalcemic tetany, recumbency and variable seizure-like activity. The condition is invariably fatal. Based on the severity of the clinical phenotype, occurrence only in the TB breed, and similarity to inherited infantile hypocalcemia in humans, a genetic investigation was performed. Clinicopathologic data from two affected TB foals excluded other causes of hypocalcemia. Pedigree analysis revealed a likely autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, with both foals related on the sire's side within 2 generations and on the dam's side within 6 generations. DNA samples from both foals and their dams were whole-genome sequenced to~12x coverage on an IlluminaHiSeq2500. Sequence reads were trimmed, mapped to EquCab2.0, and variants identified. Initially, candidate genes implicated in human inherited hypocalcemia (CASR, GNA11, or TRPM6) were evaluated for putative genetic mutations but none were identified. To further investigate other potential variants, a whole-genome association study was performed. A segregating putative functional variant, resulting in a homozygous nonsense mutation in a gene encoding for a guanine nucleotide exchange factor,was highly associated with idiopathic hypocalcemia. The altered base pair is 100% conserved across 100 vertebrae species. Additionally, this genetic variant was not identified in 175 horses from 21 non-TB breeds. Comparative data revealed that, while expressed ubiquitously at the protein level, the transcript is predominantly expressed in parathyroid tissue. Therefore, a nonsense mutation in a guanine nucleotide exchange factor is a likely causative variant for idiopathic hypocalcemia in Thoroughbred foals.Report of the Fourth International Havemeyer Equid HerpesvirusWorkshop, Beaufort, North Carolina, USA D.

Many veterinary drugs are substrates for P-gp including anticancer agents(vincristine, doxorubicin), antidiarrheal agents (loperamide), and parasiticides (macrocyclic lactones). Because of P-gp significant influence on drug disposition and the risk of severe adverse drug reactions when P-gp function is defective, human pharmaceutical companies routinely screen candidate drugs to determine whether or not they are substrates for this transporter. The availability of similar information for canine P-gp is currently lacking. Our laboratory has recently developed an ex vivo 3D canine enteroid system, which accurately models the physiological and molecular features of the intestinal tissue environment. The aim of this research was to assess whether enteroids could serve as a drug testing assay for canine P-gpmediated intestinal transport. P-gp expression was assessed using qPCR of intestinal tissues and enteroids from a Healthy Control (HC), a protein losing enteropathy (PLE) dog, and a dog infested with roundworms (RW). Immunofluorescence staining of canine enteroids in a transwell culture system was performed to assess the localization of P-gp receptors. Functional assays were performed using rhodamine123 (Rh123), a fluorescent dye substrate for P-gp, with or without verapamil (P-gp inhibitor). P-gp function was then quantitated by fluorescent microscopy and Ima-geJ. Knockout of the gene coding for P-pg (Multi-drug resistance protein-1, MDR1), was achieved in canine enteroids by lipofectamine transfection with a CRISPR/Cas9 all-in-one plasmid targeting the naturally occurring MDR-1 deletion mutation present in Collies and other breeds. Transfection efficiency was monitored by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in both control and CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid transfected enteroids. An un-paired t-tests was used to compare the mean luminal intensity obtained with ImageJ. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the mean quantitation cycle obtained with qPCR, and P = 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. P-gp gene expression was not significantly different (P = 0.06) between enteroids and the epithelial layer of original intestinal tissues (quantitation cycle values expressed in Mean AE S.D): Organoid: PLE AE 0.7); HC (24.1 AE 0.5). These results confirm that enteroids express P-pg in comparable amounts as reported in vivo. The culture of primary canine enteroids in a Transwell system showed apical expression of P-gp, which is consistent with in vivo observations. Co-incubation with verapamil significantly reduced Rh123 fluorescence in the lumen of enteroids to approximately 50% of that seen with Rh123 incubation alone (P = 0.05), indicating that Pgp-mediated transport function was successfully blocked. In addition, canine 3D enteroids were successfully transfected in a stable manner with CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid to knockout MDR1.In summary, P-gp gene expression, localization, and function in canine enteroids were similar to those of intestinal tissues they were originally derived from. The knockout of P-gp expression in canine enteroids mimics the dysfunctional P-gp present in certain dog breeds and contributing to adverse drug reactions. To conclude, our novel enteroid model can serve as a useful ex vivo system for pharmaceutical drug transport and safety studies in veterinary medicine.Efficacy of Robenacoxib for the Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Disorder-Associated Pain and Inflammation in CatsDuncan Lascelles -North Carolina State University; Derek Adrian -North Carolina State University; Jonathan King -Elanco; Rudolph Parrish -Elanco; Stephen King -Elanco; Steve Budsberg -University of Georgia; Margaret Gruen -North Carolina State University Chronic musculoskeletal disorder (CSMD) affects an estimated 30 million cats in the US, with no medications approved for this indication.",
