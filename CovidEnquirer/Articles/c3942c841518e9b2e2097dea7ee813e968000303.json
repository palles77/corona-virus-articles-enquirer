We have previously contributed to an overview on the contemporary treatment of SARS [2] , and the whole topic has also been reviewed elsewhere [3] . In this article, we aim to focus on the management of a subgroup of critically ill SARS patients with more significant respiratory failure.",

More than onethird of all the SARS patients required high flow oxygen therapy [4] , 20-30% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission or high dependency care, and 13-26% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [5, 6] . The clinical course of some of these patients can progress relentlessly irrespective of all attempts at pharmacological treatment, eventually resulting in septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).",

Neutrophilia could be due to SARS per se, to superimposed infection or related to corticosteroid administration. Pancytopaenia, if present, could be due to haemophagocytosis syndrome [7] or reactivation of latent human parvovirus (unpublished data). Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and picture of disseminated intravascular coagulation has been reported [8] . Coinfections with other agents including Chlamydia-like agents [9] , metapneumovirus [10] or influenza virus (unpublished data) have been reported. Persistent and increasing elevations of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and transaminases levels are common [11, 12, 13] . Associated lung damage is believed to be the result of a virally-triggered inflammatory reaction mediated by a host of cytokines [14, 15] . In sicker patients, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-16, TNF-\u03b1) and TGF-\u03b21 were higher, with slower decline on clinical recovery [14] .",

Cavitation is rare but may be associated with superimposed infection in patients with a prolonged illness course and who are mechanically ventilated [17] . High-resolution computer tomography (HRCT) of the thorax showed focal ground-glass and scattered \"crazy paving\" patterns at presentation, followed by development of interstitial thickening, consolidation, pleural reaction, and scarring and fibrosis in later stages [18, 19] . Small (<1 cm) pulmonary cysts may be detected even if the patient is not receiving ventilatory assistance [19] . Subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothoraces or pneumomediastinum are distinct complications of severe SARS [18] . HRCT features of late-stage ARDS caused by SARS are similar to those arising from other causes [19] .",

Where effective anti-viral therapy is available, it should be started as early as possible after diagnosis, and even empirically if suspicious clinical features and especially epidemiological links are present. Since critically ill patients are deemed to have already progressed from the viral replicative phase to the immunopathological phase [5] , concomitant institution of an immunomodulatory therapy should also be considered [11] . Since there are no consensus regarding the most optimal treatment regimen in these respects, we will thus review the more commonly used agents and discuss their relative merits based on published reports. When respiratory failure eventually sets in, oxygen supplementation, assisted ventilation and intensive supportive treatments will be required.",

It can inhibit the coronaviral proteases, thus blocking the processing of viral replicase polyprotein and preventing the replication of viral RNA. Ritonavir inhibits lopinavir metabolism thus increasing its serum concentration, but it has no activity against SARS-CoV. In a retrospective analysis in Hong Kong [26] , 31 patients who had received Kaletra as rescue therapy together with high dose corticosteroids had no difference in rates of oxygen desaturation, intubation and mortality compared with a matched cohort. However, when given as initial treatment in combination with ribavirin in another subgroup of 44 patients, there were significant reductions in the need for rescue pulsed corticosteroid therapy, intubation rate and overall mortality. In addition to the prevalence of diarrhoea among these patients which may render oral drugs more appropriate and useful, synergism between kaletra and ribavirin might have contributed to the benefits since either drug alone has only weak anti-viral activities. Another Hong Kong study of 41 SARS patients treated with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin compared with 111 patients (historical controls) treated with ribavirin only showed that adverse clinical outcomes (ARDS or death) were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the historical controls at day 21 after symptom onset. Further randomised placebo controlled trials are required [27] .",

Clinicoradiological surrogate criteria have been used to indicate the onset of this immune hyperactive phase, thus providing a practical guide to the timing of starting corticosteroids [11] .

If fever is accompanied by obvious respiratory deterioration in the absence of superimposed pulmonary or systemic infection, most patients can be presumed to be suffering from a severe recrudescence of the SARS illness. In such critically ill SARS patients, further escalation of immunomodulation is warranted. Such deterioration could sometimes occur very rapidly; immediate administration of pulsed methylprednisolone therapy at 500-1000 mg per day intravenously for 2 days, followed by tapering doses in the subsequent weeks, has been associated with improved outcome [11, 34] . Up to one-third to one-half of critically ill SARS patients may benefit from this strategy [4, 33, 34] .

It was commonly employed in many Chinese hospitals [29, 31, 37, 41, 42] and our own centre in Hong Kong [11, 43, 44] . Early application may be beneficial because it could rapidly improve vital signs, oxygenation and tachypnoea [41, 43] , and may reduce the need for increasing dosages of corticosteroids for progressive respiratory failure. It could avoid intubation and invasive ventilation in up to two-thirds of critically ill SARS patients [29, 32, 43] . Use of NIV in immunocompromised subjects of other diseases has reported similarly reduced rates of endotracheal intubation and serious complications [45] . NIV in SARS may be of particular benefit, since high dose corticosteroids per se would already predispose to ventilator-associated pneumonia, and risks to healthcare workers (HCW) could also be markedly reduced through obviating the need for intubation, a potentially highly infectious procedure. Patients who respond to NIV will usually do so within 24 hours, non-responders who will eventually need endotracheal intubation can thus be identified early [43] .",

The usual contraindications to NIV apply, including impaired consciousness, uncooperative patient, high aspiration risk, and haemodynamic instability [35] . SARS-related respiratory failure responds readily to NIV given at low pressures. CPAP of 4-10 cm H 2 O, or bi-level pressure support with inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of <10 cm H 2 O and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) of 4-6 cm H 2 O are reasonable starting pressures [43] .

The tidal volume should be kept low (e.g. 5-6 ml/Kg predicted body weight), and plateau pressures maintained below 30 cm H 2 O. Because of a higher risk of barotraumas in SARS, the lowest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) which could achieve satisfactory alveolar recruitment and oxygenation, usually 5-6 cm water, should be employed. Other adjunctive measures employed in the usual ARDS cases had been tried in SARS, including: prone positioning [64, 47] , high frequency oscillatory ventilation [64, 47] , nitric oxide [47] , high PEEP and regular lung recruitment [64] , but their efficacy is uncertain.",

A low overall mortality of 3.4% (3/88) was obtained, with all three deaths occurring in patients over the age of 65 years. Twenty four percent required ICU admission: 14% received NIV (bi-level pressure support) alone and 10% had both NIV and invasive mechanical ventilation. HRCT thorax in all survivors taken 50 days after commencement of treatment showed most did not have clinically significant lung scarring. Another multi-centered study comparing four treatment regimens in Guangzhou, China, also found that a regimen of high dose corticosteroids adjusted according to clinical and radiological severity, coupled with nasal CPAP ventilation, produced the best result: zero mortality in all 60 clinically-defined SARS patients, mean age 30.5 years. With 40% treated with CPAP and none requiring mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, very low mortality was again recorded among a further 160 patients treated with the same regimen [29] .",

They include advanced age [4, 57, 58, 59] , diabetes [5, 13, 59] , heart disease [5, 59] , other significant coexisting conditions [53, 59, 60] , shortness of breath on admission [60] , degree of hypoxaemia [58] , high total leukocyte count on admission [4, 12, 60] , high initial lactate dehydrogenase [4, 57, 58] , low platelet counts [58] , and use of pulsed doses of corticosteroid [4, 60] . Compared to patients with nasopharyngeal aspirates negative for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR, PCR-positive ones are more likely to require ICU care and mechanical ventilation, develop acute renal failure and die [60] . In particular, mortality was high among ICU patients: 28-day ICU mortality was variously reported to be 26-37% [42, 64, 65] . Older age, severity of illness, lymphocyte count, decreased steroid dose, positive fluid balance, chronic disease or immunosuppression, and nosocomial sepsis were associated with poor ICU outcome [65] . Patients who had diarrhoea were more likely to require ventilatory support and ICU care [60] . Higher serum SARS-CoV concentration in the early stage of the disease was a prognostic indicator for later ICU admission [62] . Patients presenting with more extensive radiographic involvement also predicted the need for ICU care or death [63] . Age alone is a consistent and strong prognostic factor in all series. Age-stratified death rates were estimated to be <1% in patients below 24 years of age, 6% between 25 and 44 years, 15% between 45 and 64 years, and >50% in elderly patients over 65 years old [66] . Corresponding estimates in Hong Kong were 13% in those below 60 years of age, and 43% in those over 60 years [67] .",

It should be performed by the most skilful airway practitioner in a negative-pressure room behind closed doors. Should the operator choose to wear additional personal protective equipment like the Airmate HEPA Powered Air Purifying Respirator System (3M, MN, USA), he/she must be familiar with its mode of operation and the precautions required for gowning and degowning, and must be assisted by a colleague with similar knowledge [11] . A \"modified awake\" intubation technique has been suggested as the best possible compromise between patient and operator safety by administration of a combination of midazolam, fentanyl and lidocaine until the patient reaches the desired level of sedation [71] . The patient is then paralysed after intubation to minimize coughing. Alternatively, the \"rapid sequence induction\" technique with intravenous administration of midazolam and suxamethonium can also minimize patient coughing. It should however be emphasized that, unless there is prior preparation for a surgical airway, neuromuscular paralysis should be avoided in anticipated difficult intubation in order to maintain spontaneous respiration [71] . Both bronchoscopy and NIV should be performed in a negative pressure room. Although there is widespread fear of infective risk by NIV [6, 55] , centres with such experience, including ours, have found that its use is safe if the necessary precautions are taken [11, 29, 42, 43] .",
