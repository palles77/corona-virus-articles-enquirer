The animals were treated with a combination of cefperazone-sulbactam (80 mg/kg/day for 5 days, IM; Huirui, China) and fluconazole capsules (200 mg per day for 3 weeks, PO; Lanlin, China). After one month of treatment, the 26 year old female and the 12 year old male died with convulsions and other neurologic signs including repetitive muscle fasciculations, muscle stiffening, and collapse. The other female slowly recovered. Upon necropsy, the lungs, liver, and spleen of all animals had multifocal hemorrhagic foci. Hemorrhage and edema was present in the intestinal mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes.

The isolated virus was named as giant panda virus (GPV). To visualize the virus, the culture supernatants were examined under an electron microscope post negativestaining. As shown in Fig. 2A , coronavirus-like viral particles were clearly seen in the supernatant of samples. The ultrathin sections also showed multiple inclusion bodies within the cytoplasm of FCWF cells. Within inclusion bodies some virions had an electron-lucent center, with the nucleocapsid juxtaposed to the envelope, while others were relatively dark when the nucleocapsid was present throughout the particle (Fig. 2B) . A TCID 50 of GPV was calculated as 10 6 .30 /mL according to Reed-Muench's method [1] . The viral activity of GPV could be neutralized with CCV positive serum from dogs. The mean neutralization titer was 2.18, but when using the CCV negative serum, the neutralization titer was 0.3. This observation demonstrates that the activity of GPV could be specifically neutralized by CCV-positive serum but not by CCV-negative serum. The virus was further analyzed at the molecular level using RT-PCR. After RT-PCR a 514 bp fragment was amplified from tissues and infected FCWF cells, while PCR for non-infected FCWF cells yielded no results. By sequencing and analysis, the sequences from tissues and infected FCWF cells showed 100% nucleotide identity. As shown in Fig. 3A , the amino acid sequence of the amplified GPV S gene was 98.7% identical to the S protein of CCV K378. In addition, the sequence of the GPV S gene was also 84.3% to 100% identical to the other strains of CCV, including CCV1-71 (AF116246), CCV6 (A22882), CCV C54 (A22886), CCV INSAVC (D13096), UWSMN-1 (AF327928), CCV TN449 (AF116245), and CCV5821 (AB017789) (Fig. 3B) . The pandas in this case study did not respond to anti-bacterial or anti-fungal therapy. However, the clinical course of their disease suggested pathology caused by an infectious organism. Multifocal hemorrhagic foci on tissues including intestine, lung, liver and spleen indicated the organism could induce viremia while severe endosmotic lesions on hepatic lobules and micronodular proliferation of lymphoid cells implied that the organism might propagate in the cells. All of the findings were consistent with a viral disease process. In addition, coronavirus-like viral particles in supernatant from negative-staining spleen and liver tissues were seen under the electron microscope. Therefore, isolation and identification of a potential viral pathogen was pursued.",

However to date, there have been no published reports of CCV infection in pandas. In this study, we isolated a strain of CCV from two giant pandas, which suggests that pandas can be infected with CCV. To isolate the virus, two inoculation methods including simultaneous inoculation and monolayer-culture inoculation were tried and a coronavirus was successfully isolated.
