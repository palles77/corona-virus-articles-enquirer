Amino acids 319-510 on the S protein have been mapped as the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates binding to the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on SARS-CoV susceptible cells. In this study, we expressed a fusion protein containing the human codon-optimized RBD of the SARS-CoV spike protein linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (named RBD-Fc) in HEK293 cells. The RBD-Fc protein was purified by affinity chromatography. The flow cytometry assay showed that the purified RBD-Fc protein could bind to ACE2. We demonstrated that the RBD spike protein alone could be internalized into SARS-CoV susceptible cells together with ACE2. We also showed that the removal of N-glycans from the RBD spike protein did not abolish this phenomenon. Our discoveries may have some implications for the development of the SARS vaccine.",

Additionally, there are 23 potential Nlinked glycosylation sites in the SARS-CoV S protein , and two are in the RBD. Usually, ligand binding induces endocytosis of the receptors. Our previous study demonstrated that the binding of the S protein to endogenous ACE2 in mice resulted in down-regulation of ACE2 surface expression (Kuba et al., 2005) , implying ACE2 internalization. Therefore, we would like to explore whether RBD, the minimal receptor-binding domain on the S protein, could induce endocytosis of the receptor.",

For the B-lymphotropic papovavirus (LPV), the binding capacity is similar at 4 and 37 \u2022 C (Haun et al., 1993) . For HIV-1, the affinity of virion-bound gpl20 for soluble CD4 at 37 \u2022 C is higher than that at 4 \u2022 C (Moore et al., 1991) . However, internalization only occurs at 37 \u2022 C. It is known that cellular endocytosis is a mechanism for SARS-CoV entry (Inoue et al., in press; Wang et al., 2008) . Our previous study using a flow cytometry assay showed that SARS-CoV S protein is internalized by VeroE6 cells together with ACE2 at 37 \u2022 C (Kuba et al., 2005) . The RBD of the S protein binds to ACE2, which is the ligand of ACE2. To determine whether the RBD spike protein binding leads to the endocytosis of SARS-CoV by susceptible cells, a flow cytometry internalization assay was performed. A FITC-conjugated human IgG-specific antibody cannot pass through the plasma membrane of live cells, so it was used to detect the cell surface-bound RBD-Fc protein. The fluorescence intensity on the surface of VeroE6 cells incubated with RBD-Fc at 37 \u2022 C was much weaker than those incubated at 4 \u2022 C ( Fig. 2A) . We speculate that this decrease of fluorescence inten- To visualize the changes of the receptors on susceptible cells, we incubated ACE2-GFP-293 cells, which stably express human ACE2 fused with GFP at its C-terminus on the surface, with RBD-Fc at 37 \u2022 C for 3 h, using Fc protein as a control. We then observed them under a fluorescence microscope. According to Scearce-Levie et al. (2005) , the receptor-internalized cells (positive cells) were judged by the following criteria: (a) the green cell boundary became weak and vague; and (b) three or more clear and visible green vesicles existed in the cytoplasm. In the cells incubated with the Fc protein, besides the presumed protein synthesis and trafficking sites in the cytoplasm, strong green fluorescence was predominantly on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B) , which was similar to the fluorescence distribution of the untreated cells (data not shown). However, the intensity of the green fluorescence on the surface of those cells incubated with RBD-Fc was very low, accompanied by clear and visible green vesicles in the cytoplasm of almost all cells (96.2%; Fig. 2B , D and E). In contrast, only 6.1% of cells had visible green vesicles in the cytoplasm in the control ( Fig. 2D and E) . These results show that after incubation with the RBD spike protein, ACE2 internalization occurred, which suggested that ACE2 internalization was the RBD spike protein-dependent.",

After being incubated with RBD-Fc or Fc protein at 37 \u2022 C for 3 h, ACE2-GFP-293 cells were washed to remove excess RBD-Fc or Fc protein and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Next, immunostaining was performed using an Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated human IgG-specific antibody to detect the distribution of Fc or RBD-Fc protein in the cells. As shown in Fig. 2C , there were strong Fc fluorescence signals in the cells incubated with the RBD-Fc, whereas no Fc signal was detected in the cells incubated with the Fc. This indicated that the RBD spike protein was internalized into the cells after incubation. Furthermore, the Fc signals overlapped with the ACE2-GFP signals in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface (Fig. 2C, D and E) , which suggests that the RBD spike proteins are co-localized with ACE2 proteins in these cells. The Fc signals especially accumulated in the green vesicles seen in live cells ( Fig. 2B and C) . The results demonstrated that the binding of the RBD spike protein to ACE2 induced internalization by endocytosis.",

For the influenza virus, certain glycans near the receptorbinding site affect the binding of the HA to cellular receptors (Ohuchi et al., 1997) . We therefore explored whether glycosylation on the RBD spike protein has an effect on the interaction between SARS-CoV and ACE2. The S protein of SARS-CoV has 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites , and a minimal ACE2-binding domain (amino acids 319-510) contains two (amino acids 330 and 357), which are N-linked glycosylated when expressed in HEK293 cells (Chakraborti et al., 2005) . The RBD-Fc we expressed migrated at approximately 64 kDa on the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1) , which was slightly larger than the molecular mass of the RBD-Fc based on amino acid composition. We speculated that RBD-Fc might therefore be N-linked glycosylated. To confirm this, deglycosylation of the RBD-Fc was performed using PNGase F, which hydrolyzes all types of N-glycan chains. After treatment with PNGase F, the single band of approximately 64 kDa migrated as a 54 kDa band on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2) , which indicated that the RBD-Fc was N-linked glycosylated in HEK293 cells. To maintain the natural conformation, the RBD-Fc protein was deglycosylated with PNGase F under nondenaturing conditions. As shown in Fig. 3A (lane 3) , the N-glycans in the RBD-Fc were removed under nondenaturing conditions as completely as under denaturing conditions.",

Cellular endocytosis is often used by viruses for entry (Marsh and Helenius, 2006; Pelkmans and Helenius, 2003) . Viruses may enter different cell types via different endocytotic pathways. SARS-CoV mainly utilizes the clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway for its entry into HepG2 cells (Inoue et al., in press ). However, SARS-CoV can enter VeroE6 cells in a novel clathrin-and caveolae-independent endocytotic pathway (Wang et al., 2008) . Our previous study showed that the SARS-CoV S protein could induce the internalization and recycling of ACE2 (Wang et al., 2008) .

For instance, after binding with HIV gp120, CD4 was internalized and led to the impairment of immune cell functions (Wahl et al., 1989) , and the binding of measles hemagglutinin resulted in the down-regulation of its receptor, CD46, to disrupt the complement pathways and immune systems (Oldstone et al., 1999) .

Through treatment with PNGase F, we demonstrated that the RBD spike protein was N-linked glycosylated in HEK293 cells, which is consistent with the result obtained by site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Chakraborti et al., 2005) . Here, we demonstrated that N-glycans did not affect RBD binding to ACE2 through the ACE2 internalization assay induced by the RBD spike protein, which is in agreement with co-crystal RBD expressed in Sf9 cells bound with ACE2 (Li et al., 2005) and previous mutagenesis analysis (Chakraborti et al., 2005) . The role of glycosylation in SARS-CoV infection is to be further investigated.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we created the stable RBD-Fc-expressing cell lines, and we demonstrated SARS-CoV RBD spike protein induced cell endocytosis after binding to ACE2. Additional N-glycans on the RBD spike protein had no effect on its binding to ACE2. Cell endocytosis is an important mechanism for SARS-CoV entry. Our study shows that the RBD spike binding is the trigger for this entry pathway, which further confirms the importance of the RBD spike protein in SARS-CoV infection. Because the RBD spike binding to ACE2 contributes to SARS pathogenesis, the use of subunit vaccines based on the RBD spike should be considered carefully. A RBD spike protein mutant, which diminishes or eliminates its avidity with ACE2, but retains the major neutralizing epitopes, is desirable. Previous study has shown that the replacement of two active-site histidines of ACE2 by asparagines does not affect the syncytia formation mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein . A soluble form of enzyme-inactive ACE2 may be used for SARS therapy.",

The purified RBD-Fc (lane 1), the purified RBD-Fc was deglycosylated with PNGase F in the presence of SDS (lane 2), the purified RBD-Fc was deglycosylated with PNGase F in the absence of SDS (lane 3). (B) The deglycosylated RBD-Fc under nondenaturing conditions (dg-RBD-Fc) can still induce ACE2 internalization as the glycosylated RBD-Fc. ACE2-GFP-293 cells were incubated with the Fc protein (a), the RBD-Fc protein (b), the mixture of PNGase F and RBD-Fc (c) and the dg-RBD-Fc (d) at 37 \u2022 C for 3 h. The distribution of ACE2-GFP molecules in live cells was observed under a fluorescence microscope. (C) and (D) Statistical analysis of the differences among treatments of the RBD-Fc, the dg-RBD-Fc or the mixture of PNGase F and the RBD-Fc using Chi-square test. P < 0.05 was considered to be significantly different. sity might result from the internalization of RBD-Fc by VeroE6 cells.",
