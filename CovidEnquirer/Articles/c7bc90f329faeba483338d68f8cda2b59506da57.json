            "text": "As with many other viruses, the initial cell attachment of rotaviruses, major causative agent of infantile gastroenteritis, is mediated by interactions with specific cellular glycans 1-4 . The distally located VP8* domain of the rotavirus spike protein VP4 5 mediates such interactions. The existing paradigm is that 'sialidase-sensitive' animal rotavirus strains bind to glycans with terminal sialic acid (Sia), whereas 'sialidase-insensitive' human rotavirus (HR) strains bind to glycans with internal Sia such as GM1 3 . Although the involvement of Sia in the animal strains is firmly supported by crystallographic studies 1,3,6,7 , it is not yet known how VP8* of HRs interacts with Sia and whether their cell attachment necessarily involves sialoglycans. We found that VP8* of a HR strain specifically recognizes A-type histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) using a glycan array screen comprised of 511 glycans, and that virus infectivity in HT-29 cells is abrogated by anti-Atype antibodies as well as significantly enhanced in CHO cells genetically modified to express the A-type HBGA, providing a novel paradigm for initial cell attachment of HR.

Our crystallographic studies show that the A-type HBGA binds to the HR VP8* at the same location as the Sia in the VP8* of animal rotavirus, and suggest how subtle changes within the same structural framework allow for such receptor switching.

            "text": "Based on neutralization specificity of the outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4, rotaviruses are classified into G (VP7) and P (VP4) genotypes following a dual nomenclature system similar to influenza viruses 11 . The crystallographic structures of VP8* from two sialidaseinsensitive human strains, representing P [8] (Wa) 1 and P [4] (DS1) 12 , from two sialidasesensitive animal strains, representing P [3] (RRV) 6, 7 and P [7] (CRW-8) 1 , and the structures of two animal VP8* with bound Sia 1,6,12 have been previously reported. NMR, cell binding and neutralization assays, showed that the sialidase-insensitive P [8] Wa strain binds to gangliosides such as GM1 using internal Sia 3 . These studies suggested that while the sialidase-sensitive strains recognize glycans with terminal Sia such as GD1a, the sialidaseinsensitive rotavirus stains bind to gangliosides such as GM1 with an internal Sia moiety, and gave rise to the notion that Sia is the key determinant for host cell recognition in rotaviruses. Our goal was to determine whether all sialidase-insensitive HR genotypes recognize gangliosides with an internal Sia moiety for initial cell attachment or whether they recognize different glycans in a genotype-dependent manner. VP8* (aa 64-224), cloned from a HR strain (HAL1166), first isolated from a child in Finland 13 , was expressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and crystallized for structural analysis. The sialidaseinsensitive HAL1166 strain, phylogenetically and serologically belongs to G8P [14] genotype 14 . Although not as prevalent as the P [4] and P [8] genotypes, the P [14] genotypes are being increasingly documented by global rotavirus surveillance [15] [16] [17] , and P [14] HRs are thought to be able to jump from animal to human hosts 17 .",

The structure of P [14] VP8* superimposes well with all of the VP8* structures previously determined. One significant difference between these structures is in the width of the cleft separating the two twisted \u03b2barrel sheets (Fig. 1b) . In P [14] VP8*, it is narrower, similar to that in the VP8* of the animal strains, than the cleft in the VP8* of the other two human strains. In the animal VP8* structures, Sia binds near the cleft (Fig. 1c) . Although the cleft in the P [14] VP8* structure is of similar dimensions as in the animal VP8* structures, the structural features in this region of P [14] VP8* is not compatible with Sia binding. In addition to changes in the amino acid residues (Fig. 1d) and side-chain orientations, the positioning of the amino acid residues is slightly shifted in this region because of an insertion (aa 187). The side-chain of Y188 is oriented in such a way that it would cause steric hindrance to Sia binding (Fig. 1c) . Furthermore, the P [14] VP8* structure with a narrower cleft and several amino acid changes (Fig. 1d) is not compatible with binding of GM1 as suggested, based on computer modeling, for VP8* of the other human strains with a wider cleft 3 .",

The binding of HBGA, which does not cause any conformational changes in the VP8*, involves a network of both direct and solvent-mediated hydrogen bond interactions, in addition to several stabilizing hydrophobic contacts (Fig. S4 ). The terminal GalNAc and Gal of the HBGA participate in all of the interactions (Fig. 2c) . The GalNAc participates in direct hydrogen bonding interactions involving the side chains of R101 and T191, and hydrophobic interactions involving L190 and T191, whereas Gal participates in hydrogen bonding interactions with the main chain carbonyl groups of Y189 and S187, and hydrophobic interactions with Y189 and Y188.

The only positionally conserved common residue between P [14] and animal VP8* that participates in the ligand interactions is R101. Although the position matches well, its side-chain orientation differs significantly between the two structures ( Fig.  1c) . Without this change, the side-chain of R101 in the P [14] VP8* structure would cause steric hindrance to the GalNAc moiety of the HBGA. Most other residues that participate in the ligand interactions are upstream of position 187 in the VP8* sequence, where an insertion occurs in the P [14] VP8*. This insertion along with sequence variation alters the configuration of the binding site in the P [14] VP8* to allow specific interaction with HBGA. Insertion at position 187 causes a localized change which makes the side-chain of Y188 clash with Sia when placed in the structure of P [14] VP8* (Fig. 1c) . Following this residue, the polypeptide chain reverts back to the same course as in the animal VP8* structures such that Y189 and T191, which interact with HBGA, are now positionally equivalent to Y188 and S190 which interact with Sia in the animal VP8* (Figs. 1c and 2c).",

To examine the biologic relevance of HBGA binding to P [14] VP8*, virus infectivity assays were performed. Using intestinal HT29 cells isolated from a type A individual, dose-dependent abrogation of HAL1166 infectivity was observed, with a greater than 75% reduction at the highest concentration of anti-A-type HBGA antibody as compared to an isotype control antibody (Figs. 3a and 3b). In contrast, this antibody did not inhibit the sialidase-sensitive SA11 rotavirus strain (Fig. 3a) . To further ascertain the specificity of the HAL1166 to A-type HBGA, infectivity assays were performed using parental CHO cells, which do not express any HBGA, and genetically-engineered CHO cells expressing either A-or H-type HBGA. CHO cells expressing type A HBGA showed a large increase in infectivity with HAL1166, but not SA11, compared to parental CHO cells or those expressing type H alone (Fig. 3c) . Similarly, low infectivity was observed in Caco-2 cells, isolated from a blood type O individual, compared to HT29 cells that express type A HBGA (data not shown). Specificity to A-type HBGA was further confirmed by performing hemagglutination assays using P [14] GST-VP8*. Type A blood cells, but not type O or B, were hemagglutinated by soluble VP8* (Fig. S5) . This is the first study describing the structural interactions between a human VP8* and a cellular glycan. Importantly, it shows that binding of sialylated glycans is not obligatory among sialidase-insensitive HR strains. Our finding that P [14] VP8* specifically recognizes HBGA raises important questions such as whether other HR strains interact with similar or other HBGAs in a serotype-dependent manner like in human noroviruses 10 , and whether genetically controlled differential expression of HBGAs among world's population plays a role in susceptibility to HRs. In a recently published paper, G8P [14] rotavirus was identified in the stool samples from two adults with diarrhea, who lived in the same geographical area in Denmark 21 . The blood type of one of these patients and of another patient infected with a G6P [14] virus was type A (B. B\u00f6ttiger, personal communication). Although this is a small sample size, these findings warrant further epidemiological studies to determine whether HBGA is a susceptibility factor for rotaviruses. Based on sequence comparisons, our prediction that VP8* of the K8 HR strain (P [9] genotype) would also recognize A-type HBGA (Fig. S6) is firmly supported by infectivity assays with parental and derivative CHO cells (Fig. 3c) .",
