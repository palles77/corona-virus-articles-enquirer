The in vitro activity of 10 lozenge formulations has previously been investigated against S. pyogenes and S. aureus. 32 In this study, the in vitro bactericidal activity of AMC/DCBA lozenges against a broader range of potentially pathogenic oropharyngeal bacteria was assessed to evaluate the potential in vivo action of these lozenges against organisms associated with pharyngitis.",

For S. pyogenes, H. influenza, A. haemolyticum and F. necrophorum, the decrease in CFU/mL at 1 minute exceeded 3 log 10 (99.9% decrease), whereas greater than 3 log 10 reductions were recorded at 5 minutes for S. dysgalactiae and M. catarrhalis and at 10 minutes for S. aureus. Additionally, at all time points, the SD (Table 1 ) of the replicates was small (\u22640.9 log 10 CFU/mL), indicating consistent and reproducible observations. The results demonstrated that the AMC/DCBA lozenge exhibits broad bactericidal activity against a range of organisms implicated in pharyngitis and the rapid activity observed is consistent with the time taken for a lozenge to dissolve in the mouth. 16 For all test organisms, evidence of bactericidal activity for the AMC/DCBA lozenge was recorded at the 1-minute time point. Of particular interest is the robust bactericidal activity against S. pyogenes, the most frequent cause of bacterial pharyngitis. 4 Reductions exceeding 99.9% were achieved by 1 minute for S. pyogenes, H. influenza, A. haemolyticum and F. necrophorum, by 5 minutes for S. dysgalactiae and M. catarrhalis and by 10 minutes for S. aureus. The bactericidal activity of an AMC/DCBA lozenge within a 10-minute period is important as it is consistent with the duration that a lozenge remains in the mouth; furthermore, the active ingredients were also tested at the expected concentration achieved when a lozenge is dissolved in the mouth, assuming a volume of 5 mL of saliva.",

These data likewise complement recent studies showing the in vitro viricidal effects of lozenges containing AMC/DCBA (and the active ingredients as free substances) against parainfluenza virus type 3, cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 12, 13 In addition to antimicrobial activity, AMC and DCBA are proven to provide relief from the symptoms of pharyngitis, particularly sore throat, likely through their demonstrated local anesthetic-like action against voltage-gated neuronal sodium channels, 14, 34 and therefore may benefit patients presenting with either bacterial or viral pharyngitis. Furthermore, by relieving symptoms and managing patient expectations, the number of instances of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for viral pharyngitis may be reduced. A limitation of this study is that these observations were performed in vitro and therefore do not fully reflect the environment of the throat. For example, the throat may ",

The role of the patient's immune system and swallowing action on the antimicrobial activity of the lozenge or active ingredients can also not be determined using in vitro methodology. However, the incidence of these bacteria is relevantly low in the general population; therefore, studying the bactericidal activity of AMC/DCBA in vivo can be challenging. Consequently, an in vitro approach is advantageous allowing the rapid generation of robust data, for multiple organisms simultaneously, that can be used to evaluate the potential of AMC/DCBA for efficacy in vivo.",
