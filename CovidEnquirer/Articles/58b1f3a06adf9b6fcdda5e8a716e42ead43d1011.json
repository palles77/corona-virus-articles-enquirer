We reported the first Hong Kong patient without risk factors for severe A(H7N9) disease. Methods: Direct sequencing was performed on the endotracheal aspirate collected from a 36-year-old female with history of poultry contact. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to compare the current strain and previous A(H7N9) isolates. Results: The influenza A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 virus strain was detected in a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome, deranged liver function and coagulation profile, cytopenia, and rhabdomyolysis. The HA, NA and MP genes of A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 cluster with those of other human A(H7N9) strains. The PB1, PB2 and NS genes are most closely related to those of A/Guangdong/1/2013 strain identified in August 2013, but are distinct from those of other human and avian A(H7N9) strains. The other internal genes NP and PA genes are more closely related to those of non-A(H7N9) avian influenza A viruses. A unique PA L336M mutation, associated with increased polymerase activity, was found. The patient required salvage by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.",

In Hong Kong, the first human case of A(H7N9) occurred in November 2013. 15 In this study, we reported the clinical severity of this case and sequenced the viral genome directly from the endotracheal aspirate of the patient. We then performed phylogenetic analysis and compared the genetic differences between the virus from this Hong Kong patient and other human and avian A(H7N9) viruses.",

On 17th November 2013, she travelled to Shenzhen, China, where she visited a live poultry market. On 21st November, she developed malaise. Subsequently, she developed fever since 23rd November, associated with cough, sputum production, sore throat and dyspnoea. She did not have vomiting or diarrhoea. She was hospitalized on 27th November. On admission, her body temperature was 40.0 C. Her respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 97% while breathing ambient air. The pulse rate was 116 beats per minute, and the blood pressure was 120/63 mmHg. Her chest radiograph showed right lower zone consolidation and blunting of right costophrenic angle. Her condition deteriorated rapidly despite intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate 1.2 g every 8 h and oral azithromycin 500 mg every 24 h given from day 1e2 after hospitalization. She also received one dose of oral oseltamivir 75 mg on day 2 after hospitalization. Serial chest radiographs showed progression to bilateral lower zone consolidation. She subsequently required intubation and positive pressure ventilation on day 2 after hospitalization. With further deterioration and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was started on day 3 after hospitalization. Table) .",

            "text": "Although influenza virus A(H7N9) has been isolated from avian species for many years, it was not until March 2013 when the first human case was reported. 21 Phylogenetic studies using A(H7N9) viruses isolated from spring and early summer of 2013 showed that the human A(H7N9) virus was a reassortant of different avian influenza A viruses. 4, 22, 23 The HA gene was most closely related to A(H7N3) viruses and A(H7N9) viruses in wild birds. The NA gene was most closely related to influenza A(H2N9) and A(H11N9) viruses of wild birds from Hong Kong and mainland China. The internal genes MP, NP, NS, PA, PB1 and PB2 were most closely related to avian A(H9N2) viruses circulating in the domestic poultry of China. In earlier studies comparing human A(H7N9) isolates obtained from patients in spring 2013, it was found that the internal genes appeared to come from multiple sources. 21, 24 The PB2 gene of the human A(H7N9) strains isolated during spring and early summer of 2013 clusters closely together. 22 Many of the amino acid differences between the A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 and A/Guangdong/1/2013 isolates lie in the polymerase proteins which may affect the polymerase function and virus replication efficiency in mammalian hosts including humans (Table 3) . 25 In the PA protein, the L336M was only present in the A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 but not A/Guangdong/1/2013 strains or other human or avian A(H7N9) strains. In fact, L336M substitution is conserved among the 2009 pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates but rarely found in other human or avian influenza viruses. 19 PA L336M substitution has been shown to increase the polymerase activity. Mice challenged with recombinant A(H1N1) virus containing PA L336M substitution had more body weight loss and higher lung viral titres than those b Associated with enhanced polymerase activity in one study. 23 infected with the wild type virus, suggesting that PA L336M substitution is associated with higher pathogenicity in mammals. 19 This may have important clinical significance because our patient had no risk factors for severe influenza but she developed very severe pneumonia with rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome which finally required respiratory support by extracorporeal membrane oxygen. Moreover she also had multi-organ dysfunction as evident by impaired liver function and coagulation profile, cytopenia and rhadomyolysis. Another substitution, PB2 V139I, was identified only in the A/Hong Kong/470129/ 2013 and A/Guangdong/1/2013 strains, but not in other human or avian A(H7N9) strains. A previous study has also shown that V139I was enriched in human A(H7N7) viruses when compared to avian A(H7N7) viruses. 26 Further studies should be performed to ascertain the importance of these substitutions in A(H7N9) in terms of viral polymerase activity, viral load and cytotoxicity in infected cell lines or chick embryo, and virulence in animal challenge.",

In summary, our results showed that the A(H7N9) virus continues to evolve in nature and novel reassortants are likely to emerge in the future. Further studies are necessary to understand the virulence and transmissibility of this novel reassortant. ",

We have shown that while the HA, NA, and MP gene of A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 cluster with other human A(H7N9) isolates, the PB2, PB1, and NS genes are closely related to the A/Guangdong/1/2013 isolated in August 2013 but distinct from other human and avian A(H7N9) viruses detected during the spring outbreak in China. The PA gene of A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 does not cluster with any human or avian A(H7N9) strains but clusters with avian A(H9N2), A(H6N2) and A(H7N7) viruses.
