However, relationship between pollutant diffusion coefficient and viscosity in enclosed spaces has not been fully understood. In this study, turbulent Schmidt number (Sc t ) was modified as a function of turbulent kinematic viscosity rather than a constant value to better simulate dispersion of airborne contaminant in two typical enclosed spaces: an aircraft cabin and an office room. An experiment for airborne contaminant transmission was conducted in an aircraft cabin mockup. Combining with experimental data in the office room with an under floor air distribution (UFAD) system from literature, Sc t was modified based on airflow vortex structures. The performance of RNG k-\u03b5 model using the modified Sc t was found to be obviously better than that using the default Sc t value in both the two enclosed spaces. In addition, model applicability to different enclosed spaces was analyzed based on the airflow vibration frequency.",

The virus laden bio-aerosols like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1-A influenza generated by infected occupants through coughing or sneezing can be transported throughout the cabin and infect other occupants, as reported by Wilder-Smith [1] and Baker et al. [2] . In residential buildings and other indoor environments, people are continuously exposed to different air pollutants. Aerosol particles are regarded as major pollutant sources, and they are closely related to such adverse health effects [3] . Other pollutants, such as formaldehyde and volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) can increase the risk of chronic toxicity and even cancer due to prolonged and high-dose exposure [4] . Therefore, it is important to study mechanisms involved in spreading of airborne contaminants, in order to prevent transmission and make a quick respond for chemical and biological attacks in enclosed environments as well.",

            "text": "For airborne contaminant transport, turbulent Schmidt number (Sc t ) which represents the ratio between turbulent kinematic viscosity and turbulent diffusion coefficient is a key parameter for contaminant concentration prediction in turbulent airflow. Previous researchers have investigated the effect of Sc t on predicted contaminant dispersion for different situations. Sc t values ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for urban diffusion problems [5] [6] [7] . For jet flow simulations, Sc t values were suggested to be 0.2 for jet-in-cross flow [8] and 0.9 for free round jet [9] . Riddle et al. [10] reported reducing the Sc t from its ''standard value of 0.7\u2033 to 0.3 could improve the predicted ground level concentrations. From these studies, Sc t varies in value for different local flow properties, indicating its value should be performed based on the airflow structures. Shi et al. [11] proposed a new dynamic turbulent Schmidt number model based on local velocity gradient and density gradient, while their study focused on Sc t in the boundary layer. Mokhtarzadeh-Dehghan et al. [12] found Sc t should be associated with Richardson number in order to model the experimental spreading rates of heavier-than-air gases correctly in an atmospheric boundary layer. However, they didn't consider local flow properties based on the airflow structures.",

Some experimental studies were also conducted in aircraft cabins. Wang et al. [17] studied airborne contaminant transport using CO 2 as a tracer gas inside an aircraft cabin. Sze To et al. [18] studied dispersion of expiratory droplets with mixing ventilation inside an aircraft cabin mockup. Zhang et al. [19] measured and predicted contaminant distributions in a cabin mockup. They used SF 6 and mono-dispersed particles with diameter of 0.7 \u03bcm to simulate airborne contaminants. Li et al. [20] conducted an experiment for gaseous (SF 6 ) and particulate (3 \u03bcm particle) contaminant dispersion in an actual functional MD-82 aircraft cabin. They stated that in narrow cabin space, source location and thermal buoyancy had a significant effect on airborne contaminant distributions. These research made a great contribution to understanding of contaminant transport in enclosed spaces, however, they did not analyze effect of different airflow structures on the Sc t value. Airflow in enclosed spaces is a kind of interaction of different flow structures, such as vorticity and deformation; therefore, the Sc t value should not be a constant number, but be varying based on airflow structures.",

SIMPLE algorithm was applied to couple pressure and velocity, and standard and second-order were used for pressure discretization and all other variables. Residual was below 10 \u22126 for energy and 10 \u22123 for all other variables. Boussinesq approximation which is a common approach for indoor airflow simulations was employed to consider buoyancy effect. Standard wall treatment was applied to model near wall turbulence. For the boundary conditions of the aircraft cabin, the inlet velocity direction was measured by ultrasonic anemometers (UAs), while the velocity magnitude was measured by hot-sphere anemometers (HSAs). Thermal boundaries of the walls and heating manikins were measured by an infrared camera. The measured data were assigned into the diffusers which had same effective areas as the real model through userdefined functions (UDFs). The pressure outlet boundary condition was applied on the exhausts, and the reference pressure value was set to 0 Pa. Tetra-mesh was used in this study, with total grid number of nine million, and the meshes closed to diffusers and manikins were refined. Details of boundary and mesh grid conditions for the office and aircraft cabin simulations can be found in Zhang et al. [22] and Li et al. [28] respectively.",

Unlike Goldman's study, only one pair of working gases (air -SF 6 ) was used in our study, and b and c were constant. Therefore, it needed two sets of Sc t and \u03bd t data to determine these two parameters. Fig. 4 shows the predicted Q value in section CS4 of the aircraft cabin ( Fig. 1 (a) ). Blue regions are dominated by vorticity, red regions in the figure are dominated by deformation, and green regions are ambient fields. The Q value was higher in the vicinity of diffusers and at the aisle where two air jets from diffusers merged. While, the Q value was lower in the sides of the cabin due to two large flow re-circulations on each side. Two regions < D > and < M > with different vortex structures (Fig. 4) were selected to reveal the relationship between \u03bd t and Sc t in the aircraft cabin. In region < M > , source M was elected in the middle of the aisle dominated by deformation. Contaminant released from source M was transported downward by airflow and directly exhausted from the cabin. In region < D > , source D was at the breathing level of a passenger dominated by vorticity. Contaminant released from source D could travels repeatedly in region < D > and was locked up by eddy airflow. Mixed tracer gas (1% sulfur hexafluoride-SF 6 , 99% N 2 balance) was released from a rubber bulb recommended by Li et al. [20] . Diameter of the rubber bulb was 5 cm, and 200 holes with diameter of 2 mm were distributed on the bulb surface to make an almost zero momentum release. Volume flow rate of the mixed tracer gas released from each source was set to 1 L/min and was controlled through two gas rotameters with relative errors of 4% (Fig. 4) . Fig. 5 shows the predicted Q value in the cross section of the office room ( Fig. 1 (b) ). The Q value was higher near the middle of the floor, and lower in the vicinity of manikins. Two regions with different vortex structures (Fig. 5) were selected. Source 2 was in the vorticity dominated region of the cross section (X = 3.6 m), and Source 1 was in the deformation dominated region of the cross section (X = 3.28). Particles with mean diameter of 0.7 \u03bcm were used in their study. Murakami [34] and Li et al. [20] reported particles smaller than 3 \u03bcm have the similar concentration distribution as tracer gas in the room and aircraft cabin respectively. Therefore, concentration distributions for 0.7 \u03bcm particles could be used as a surrogate for that of SF 6 .",

Therefore, discrepancy for the simulated velocity fields may result in lack of improvement of the proposed procedure. Additionally, because pipe flow and air cabin flow significantly differed, application of the equation deduced from pipe flow may also result in some limited improvement.

Bazdidi-Tehrani et al. [37] proposed various non-linear eddy viscosity turbulence models and reported the traditional k-\u03b5 model using the Boussinesq's isotropic linear eddy-viscosity concept could overproduce turbulence kinetic energy at impingement zone and failed to predict complex flow structures around buildings. However, their study focused on flow and concentration fields on and around an isolated cubical building within the neutral turbulent boundary layer. Different with the turbulent core region in enclosed spaces, it is well known that, in the boundary layer, the turbulence is assumed to be anisotropic. In addition, some turbulence models, such as the v2-f model [38] , were also proposed to predict anisotropic turbulence near the wall and solve overestimated turbulence fluctuation perpendicular to the wall. Fig. 9 illustrated the modified Sc t equations and ranges of \u03bd t values for the selected different vortex structures in the aircraft cabin and office room. In these two spaces, most of the \u03bd t values fall within these ranges, but are not limited to these ranges. Because the equations of the modified Sc t are nonnegative and have specific physical meaning mentioned above, their effective ranges can cover all of the \u03bd t values in these two spaces. As shown in Fig. 9 , equations of the modified Sc t are observably different for the aircraft cabin (Eq. (12)) and office room Fig. 7 . Comparison of the experimental data with predicted SF 6 concentrations by: (a) default Sc t (0.7), (b) modified Sc t (Eq. (12) ) in the aircraft cabin. (Eq. (13)). We thought this may be caused by different airflow vibration frequencies. According to Prandtl's theory, vibration frequency is \u2032 u l / , where \u2032 u is mean fluctuation velocity, and l, per Shu's suggestion [39] , should be the Kolmogorov scale as follows:",

For the aircraft cabin, mean velocity of its inlets is 1.87 m/s [28] , and turbulence intensity is 40% [40] . For the room, mean velocity of its inlets is 0.76 m/ s, and turbulence intensity is 10-15% [22] . Accordingly, vibration frequency of airflow in the aircraft cabin is 12678 Hz, while it is 92 Hz in the office room with an UFAD system. The remarkable difference of airflow frequency between the aircraft cabin and office room may lead to different modified Sc t expression functions. Higher frequency may result in stronger diffusion ability corresponding to a lower Sc t value, and the relationship between airflow vibration frequency and Schmidt number need further research. Nevertheless, the proposed modification method expressing Sc t values as a function of \u03bd t associated with vortex structures can improve contaminant concentration prediction in turbulent flow. For other researchers in the field, if the enclosed spaces which they investigated have similar airflow structures and frequencies with ours, they can refer to our new Schmidt number; otherwise they can still use our method to modify the turbulent Schmidt number for their research.",

This study was focused on gaseous pollutants, which are common in indoor environments. Three turbulence models were evaluated. The RNG k-\u03b5 model performed the best and was employed to modify Sc t . During the modification, different airflow vortex structures including deformation and vorticity were taken into consideration. Comparing with the experimental data, performance of the RNG k-\u03b5 model using modified Sc t was found to be better than that using default Sc t value in both the two enclosed spaces. For the aircraft cabin environment, the improved model reduced the relative root mean square error from 1.13 to 0.82, and increased the correlation coefficient from 0.32 to 0.65. For the office room with an UFAD system, the improved model reduced the relative root mean square error from 1.20 to 0.92, but no observable increase was found in correlation coefficient. The application of proposed modified method for different turbulence models and environments with different airflow vibration frequencies needs further research.",
