An additional 17 probable cases have been reported from investigations 6, 8, 21, 23 . Using these sources, the following data were extracted into the line list shown in Table S1 ; reporting date either by WHO or to ProMed, symptom onset, age, gender, country where case was identified, nationality and sub-nationality of case, location where infection is believed to have occurred, whether the case was exported to a country outside of the Middle East, country where case was treated, severity of disease, patient outcome, exposure information (i.e., recent travel history to the Middle East and duration of travel, reported animal exposures, if case was a health care worker), co-morbid conditions, and genetic sequencing resulted from any patient samples. A cluster identification number was assigned to cases with specific reported epidemiologic-links and to those reported as being part of clusters.",

The distribution with the best Akaike Information Criterion is presented in the manuscript. A recent study estimated the mean serial interval to be 7.6 days 21 . However, this value was derived from a large case cluster in Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia, where infection control measures were intensified within two weeks of the detection of the outbreak, the effect of which would be to bias the observed serial intervals to be shorter than would be seen in the absence of control measures. The advantage of restricting our analysis to secondary cases caused by recent travellers to affected countries is that the source of infection can be more reliably determined than for cases arising in affected countries such as Saudi Arabia. It also provides a second independent estimate to be compared with the existing one 21 . Because the discovery of an index case prompts enhanced surveillance in contacts of that case, the timing of first detected cases of clusters presented in Table S4 is likely more representative of the relative magnitude of the epidemic over time than the incidence of cases.",

We therefore assume R index =2 in these 2 clusters. For 2 other clusters with missing data on onset dates (cluster 8 and cluster 10), we are conservative and assume that R index was equal to 1.

The data from World Tourism Organization did not exclude those who travelled on pilgrimages. However, this depends crucially on the assumed average length of stay. It is worth noting that the average was estimated to be 2.0 days for inbound tourists visiting Jordan in 2011 (World Tourism Organisation, 2012). However, as Saudi Arabia is has so many more inbound tourists than Jordan, the Saudi Arabia mean (4.0 days) is more indicative of the region as a whole. Table S9 shows the dependence of estimate on the assumed average length of stay as well as the upper and lower confidence limits based on the Poisson-likelihood-based 95% confidence bounds for the underlying rate of cases among returning non-resident travellers. These bounds do not incorporate uncertainty in either the country population sizes nor in the numbers of inbound tourists. These could be subdivided into the separate countries based on the proportion of inbound tourist arrivals to the four countries in total that were to a particular country (Table S10) . Although this is a simple approximation to a complex system, it yields useful estimates for cases in the affected Middle Eastern countries comparable to the four diagnosed among returning non-resident travellers. In particular, these estimates do not include mild cases that would not have warranted testing had they occurred in returning non-resident travellers. This does not allow for the fact that some comparable cases might well have occurred among returning non-resident travellers that returned to countries that do not test for MERS-CoV regardless of health status and travel history. It implicitly assumes that the per-day risk of infection of domestic citizens and returning non-resident travelers are the same. Of course, returning non-resident travelers might well have a higher or lower per-day risk than the domestic population, depending on the route(s) of transmission and any within-country regional variation in risk.",

Population sizes in BEAST, N B , are reported in units of effective population size in coalescent time, i.e. the population size is N B = N e \u00d7 T g where N e is the effective population size and T g is the generation time. The effective population size N e is related to the census population size N by a further transformation. Assuming a negative binomial offspring distribution and nearly neutral evolution, then the relationship between the effective population size and the actual population size is given by N 1 (t c ) = N B R 0 (R 0 + k)/(kT g ) 37, 38 , where t c is the current time. The population size at any other time is given by N 1 (t) = N 1 (t c ) exp[r (t \u2212 t c )]. In estimating N 1 , we assume by default that k = 1. An alternative, and simpler, way to estimate the number infected is as N 2 (t) = exp[r (t \u2212 t 0 )] where r is the growth rate, t 0 is the estimated TMRCA. Ideally, these estimates should be very similar if the epidemic has started from a single case and if estimates of T g and k are accurate, but this consistency is not enforced in BEAST.

Increased number of parameters compared to Table S13 reflects more branch lengths to optimise in the estimation of the tree (# params = # substitution rates + #branch lengths). Compared to the previous analysis, the data are now better fitted with models with Gamma rate variation between sites, so the revised list of favoured models used in the analysis are the TN93+G, HKY+G, GTR+G. Here, we focus on the TN93+G model (with four rate categories for Gamma rate variation). The resulting maximum likelihood tree is shown in Figure S16 . The regression of root-to-tip distance on calendar time is shown in Figure S17 , which shows a slight increase in the estimated clock rate, from 1.5x10 -3 per site per year for the previous analysis, to 1.8x10 -3 per site per year here. As in the earlier analysis, there is more than one well supported position for the root of the phylogeny, and the regression analysis of the alternative rooting is shown in Figure S18 . This also shows an increase in the clock rate estimate, from 4.9x10 -4 previously to 9.4x10 -4 substitutions per site per year here, with a TMRCA in late 2010. We find below that this latter estimate is the most consistent with a new in-depth analysis of the ingroup. We updated the phylodynamic analysis with BEAST 34 to estimate the dated phylogeny and the changing population size, using identical similar assumptions to our previous analysis, with one important modification. As we had more data, we estimated the clock rate rather than assuming fixed values and varying over a fixed range. We assumed a strict clock, and chose an (improper) clock rate with uniform distribution on [0,\u221e[. As before, convergence of the MCMC chains was excellent. We emphasise that it is not a prior assumption that the infected population is growing, since the population size parameter and the rate of exponential change parameters are independent. Figure S19 shows the estimates dated phylogeny drawn from the posterior distribution (maximum clade credibility). The estimates of the clock rate are presented in Figure S20 . The posterior median estimate is 1.0x10 -3 substitutions per site per year (95% credibility interval 6.8x10 -4 -1.3x10 -3 ). This compares to estimates by Cotten et al 39 , who find 6.3x10 -4 (95% credibility interval 1.4x10 -4 -1.1x10 -3 ). Differences in the central estimates may be the result of our inclusion of the new UAE|Dubai|France sequence which is relatively distant from the root, and exclusion of the controversial Bisha_1 sequence, which is relatively close to the root. These estimates are consistent, in that their credible intervals are highly overlapping. The updated results from the population dynamics are shown in Figures S21 and S22 and Table S18. In all cases updated estimates are consistent with previous estimates, but with reduced uncertainty. ",
