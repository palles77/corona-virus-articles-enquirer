Because only a subset of mouse primary macrophages have been identified that can support LDV replication in vitro, the precise molecular mechanism of viral entry and replication remains unclear. To analyze the LDV envelope proteins, which probably mediate viral attachment to the host cell, we developed a mammalian system for stable co-expression of LDV open reading frame (ORF) 5-and ORF 6-encoded proteins (ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins), which correspond to envelope VP-3 and M/VP-2, respectively, and compared these expressed proteins to the native ones. Western blotting analysis combined with Nglycanase digestion revealed that ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins were similar in size to native VP-3 and M/VP-2, and that ORF 5 protein was N-glycosylated, like the native VP-3. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that both ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins were distributed throughout the cytoplasm and were colocalized in most cells. Moreover, ORF 5 protein was localized both in the perinuclear region and the Golgi complex and transported to the cell surface. This mammalian expression system in which the exogenously expressed proteins closely resemble the native proteins will provide the experimental basis for further studies of the interactions between LDV envelope proteins and host cells.",

It is close to the N-terminal end of three potential adjacent transmembrane segments that mimic sequences in the corona virus M protein [11] . The larger protein is the envelope glycoprotein VP-3, encoded by ORF 5. It is generally heterogenous in size (25 -40 kD) due to varying amounts of N-glycosylation [12] . Li et al. [13] have postulated that LDV VP-3 may be the virus attachment protein. Their studies have shown that the neutralization epitope is located in the short envelope glycoprotein ectodomain and is associated with polylactosaminoglycan chains, which may affect neutralizing antibody binding to LDV virions.",

Because disulfide bond breakage causes viral infectivity loss, linkage between M/VP-2 and VP-3 appears to be required for host cell entry and is perhaps achieved by generating the virion receptor attachment site. Further analysis of the interaction between LDV VP-3-M/VP-2 heterodimer envelope proteins and host cells will require an expression system that includes glycosylation and cell surface localization. Using transient mammalian expression systems based on Sindbis and vaccinia virus-based expression vectors, the non-structural proteins 2 and 3 (nsp2 and 3) of EAV and ORF 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 products of PRRSV have been reported [15 -17] . Although in vitro translation of LDV ORF 5 and ORF 6 transcripts has been reported in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system [18] , a mammalian cell system expressing LDV proteins remains unestablished. While experiments with the transient expression systems described above are convenient for studying cytotoxicity [17] , cellular immune responses [15] , and viral processing [16] , there is considerable variability between individual experiments. Cell lines stably expressing viral envelope proteins would be useful for detailed molecular analysis of interactions between viral and host cell proteins and mechanisms underlying LDV susceptibility restriction. In this study, we established a stable mammalian cell system expressing both the LDV ORF 5-and ORF 6-encoded proteins (ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins) as viral envelope proteins and analyzed the expressed proteins by immunological methods.",

Application of this expression system will be useful for studies of the interaction between LDV envelope proteins and host cells.",
