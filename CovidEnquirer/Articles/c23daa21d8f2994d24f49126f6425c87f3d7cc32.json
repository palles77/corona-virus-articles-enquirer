Quantitative real-time PCR is often used for detecting various kinds of viruses; however, it requires more than 2 h per run. Detection assays were performed with super high-speed RT-PCR (SHRT-PCR) developed according to a newly designed heating system. The new method uses a high-speed reaction (18 s/cycle; 40 cycles in less than 20 min) for typing influenza viruses. The detection limit of SHRT-PCR was 1 copy/reaction and 10 \u22121 plaque-forming unit/reaction for viruses in culture supernatants during 20 min. Using SHRT-PCR, 86 strains of influenza viruses isolated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health were tested; the results showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for each influenza A and B virus, and swine-origin influenza virus. Twenty-seven swabs collected from the pharyngeal mucosa of outpatients were also tested, showing positive signs for influenza virus on an immunochromatographic assay; the results between SHRT-PCR and immunochromatography exhibited 100% agreement for both positive and negative results. The rapid reaction time and high sensitivity of SHRT-PCR makes this technique well suited for monitoring epidemics and pre-pandemic influenza outbreaks.",

Seasonal outbreaks of influenza present global health problems involving morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. Since 2003, the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa posing a pandemic threat of a highly lethal and contagious disease (Gambotto et al., 2008; Webster and Govorkova, 2006) . A pandemic caused by swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) infection occurred in 2009 (Dawood et al., 2009; Itoh et al., 2009; Shinde et al., 2009 ) causing more than 18,849 deaths in more than 214 countries; the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on September 10, 2010, that the pandemic had transitioned into a post-pandemic phase (WHO, 2010a,b) . The occurrence of outbreaks and pandemics indicates that rapid subtyping of influenza viruses, including avian and swine-origin viruses, is a high priority for public health response systems; rapid virus detection is expected to improve the control of the pandemic spread of influenza and patient care.",

This method offers high sensitivity and selectivity, but generally requires approximately 2 h per run; therefore, qRT-PCR is not appropriate for rapid virus detection or subtyping in outbreaks of fast-spreading and/or highly pathogenic viruses at public health centers, hospitals, airports, and other public transportation hubs. Super high-speed qRT-PCR (SHRT-PCR) is a recently developed version of qRT-PCR that is characterized by extremely short reaction times (less than 20 min per run for 40 cycles). In this assay, reaction mixtures of qRT-PCR are applied to thin compact disc (CD)-type sample containers, sealed, and rotated on heat blocks at 3 different temperatures (for denaturing, annealing, and extension temperatures).",

While SHRT-PCR is a unique variant of qRT-PCR, it can be applied to detect many kinds of microbes. In addition, the super high-speed reaction is well suited to the detection, diagnosis, and control of rapidly spreading pathogens such as those characteristic of seasonal pandemic influenza viruses. However, the clinical application of the disk-type qRT-PCR has not been reported at present. This study establishes a new method for high-speed (<20 min) typing of influenza viruses using SHRT-PCR. The analysis targeted the nucleotide sequences of the matrix protein segment of influenza virus A (A-MP), influenza virus B (B-MP), and hemagglutinin (HA) of the 2009 pandemic S-OIV and H5N1 avian influenza viruses. Using this system, 86 strains of influenza viruses isolated from hospitals in Tokyo and the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health were rapidly analyzed and subtyped. The typing results were correlated with those using a standardized qRT-PCR method. SHRT-PCR is expected to provide new strategies for controlling the transmission of influenza viruses.",

SHRT-PCR can also be applied to detect other rapidly spreading pathogens such as the SARS coronavirus (Poon et al., 2003; WHO, 2003) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (Oleksiewicz et al., 2001; Reid et al., 2001) . Rapid containment is critical for limiting the spread of these viruses, and containment depends on rapid and sensitive detection. Despite its advantages of rapidity and sensitivity, SHRT-PCT is subject to certain limitations. The SHRT-PCR system used in this study is limited to a sample capacity of 12. It is necessary for a quantitative assay to generate a standard curve with multiple defined amounts of samples; thus, SHRT-PCR may be more useful for performing qualitative rather than quantitative assays. The limitation of the number of samples can be resolved by increasing the number of sample wells on the sample container and increasing the design capacity of the testing unit. For clinical applications for public health surveillance, SHRT-PCR will be more useful than immunochromatography but less useful than qRT-PCR for influenza virus typing. This is because surveillance programs should be able to deal with large numbers of clinical samples. Overall, SHRT-PCR is a sufficiently powerful method to provide a basis for rapid pandemic containment at the WHO phase 4 stage.",
