Paired serum specimens (day 0 and days 10 to 21) can be collected for antibody titer rises if cultures do not grow viruses or bacteria. History and clinical findings may require additional culture for mycobacteria, fungal, or protozoal infection. Atypical cells may require examination of cytopathology to exclude tumor. Enterovirus and herpes simplex virus infections can be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). At least 65% to 70% of culture-negative CSF infections in patients with aseptic meningitis are enterovirus positive by PCR. Identification of specific viral pathogen is possible in as many as 55% to 70% of cases when consistent diagnostic methods are applied.",

Antibiotics should be given parenterally. Antibiotics may be used in some cases such as: a toxic looking patients, a CSF with high WBC counts, a young patient with an atypical or severe clinical presentation. Pleconaril is available for compassionate release for selected patients with enteroviral disease (i.e., antibody-deficient patients with chronic enteroviral infection).",
