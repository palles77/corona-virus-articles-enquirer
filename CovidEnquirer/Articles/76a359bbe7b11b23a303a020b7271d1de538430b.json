The WHO was notified of 27 countries have reported cases of MERS, the majority of these cases occur in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Saudi Arabia. Dromedary camels are likely to be the main source of Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) infection in humans. Methods: MERS-CoV infection rates among camels in livestock markets and slaughterhouses were investigated in Saudi Arabia. A total of 698 nasal swabs were collected and examined with Rapid assay and rtRT-PCR. Ten MERS-CoV positive samples were subjected to full genomic sequencing. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of the Rapid immunochromatographic assay (BioNote, South Korea) was evaluated as a diagnostic tool for MERS-CoV compared to rtRT-PCR. Results: The results showed a high percentage of dromedaries (56.4%) had evidence for nasal MERS-CoV infection. Phylogenetic analysis of the ten MERS-CoV isolates showed that the sequences were closely related to the other MERS-CoV strains recovered from camels and human cases. Moreover, the results showed that 195 samples were positive for MERS-CoV by rapid assay compared to 394 positive samples of rtRT-PCR, which showed low rapid assay sensitivity (49.49%) while, the specificity were found to be 100%. Conclusion: These findings indicate that these sites are a highly-hazardous to zoonotic diseases.",

In general, a significant proportion of the cases are suspected to be a result of zoonotic transmission. Serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection of dromedaries was reported from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Qatar, Jordan, Pakistan and Africa [2, 5, 6] .

The data showed that Out of the 698 camel nasal swabs tested, 195 were MERS-CoV positive and 503 were negative by the ICA, while 394 were positive and 304 were negative by the UpE and Orf1a real-time RTPCR, therefore, the sensitivity and specificity of the ICA compared to those of the realtime RT-PCR were 49.49% and 100%, respectively. Previous reports recorded sensitivity and screening quality of the ICA assay found to be 93.9% and 100%, respectively, compared with that of rtRT-PCR. Also they reported that the ICA was less sensitive for the detection of MERS-CoV antigen (10 5 TCID50) than was the UpE real-time PCR (10 4 TCID50). The difference between the assay sensitivities might be regarded to the release of subgenomic RNA after the onset of cytopathogenic effect (CPE) in cell culture, including the UpE target fragment, as previously reported [13, 14, 19] . Also the Rapid MERS-CoV Ag assay cannot detect MERS-CoV loads < 10 4 or Ct value >30. Previous report pointed out that the MERS-CoV rtRT-PCR assay is the specific assay for molecular studies in a variety of animal species and human [12, 13] . Overall, rapid screening tests are less sensitive than are confirmatory tests; however, the advantages of using rapid screening tests are the high throughput and rapid turnaround time, without requirements of sample preparation and the use of special equipment. Therefore, the ICA is considered satisfactory to be used for screening camel herds against MERS-CoV antigen across animal markets, and slaughterhouses, followed by a confirmatory test for positive samples.",
