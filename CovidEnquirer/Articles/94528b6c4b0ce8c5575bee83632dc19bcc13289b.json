            "text": "BACKGROUND: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is an immune-mediated disease that produces multiple inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord. METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluated 15 children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children and adolescents from a single institution in Adana, Turkey. RESULTS: The patients presented in a seasonal distribution, with 73.3%: (11/15) presenting in winter or spring. The majority of patients (13/15, 86.7%) had a history of acute febrile illness 2 to 40 days before presentation, and five children hadserologic evidence of specific triggers: mycoplasma (2 children), influenza-A (H1N1) (1 child), or Epstein-Barr virus. All children were treated with a standard protocol of 3 to 5 days of intravenous administration of methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin for patients who continued to deteriorate. Oseltamivir and clarithromycin were administered in patients with influenza-A (H1N1) and mycoplasma according to the serology. In 13 patients, all neurologic signs and symptoms resolved after treatment. Only one patient was left with severe neurologic sequelae and another child had recurrent attacks and was ultimately diagnosed with possible multiple sclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: The present series demonstrates that acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children occurs predominantly in winter or spring and often follows an upper respiratory tract illness for those along the southern coast of Anatolia (Mediterranean region). Early treatment with immunomodulative agents is recommended and is likely to result in a favorable outcome or full recovery. This study also suggests benefit from antiviral and antibiotic treatment initiated as soon as possible after the onset of illness.",

The clinical presentation must be polysymptomatic and must include encephalopathy in the form of alteration in consciousness or behavioral change. Systemic symptoms, such as fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, nausea, and vomiting, are common precursors to the neurologic symptoms 1,2 . The etiology and pathophysiology of ADEM are not fully understood, but ADEM usually follows an infection of the upper respiratory tract or immunization in children and young adults. An autoimmune response to myelin basic protein, triggered by infection or immunization, is considered among the most likely etiologic factors [3] [4] [5] .",

Patients presenting with a clinically isolated demyelinating syndrome (e.g., optic neuritis or transverse myelitis) or with clinical or radiologic evidence for dissemination in time and space suggesting MS were excluded 2,5 . Extensive workup for bacterial and viral infections was performed for all patients. Immunologic investigations were simultaneously performed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples. Besides those, investigation of CSF lactate for mitochondrial disorder and angiotensin converting enzyme for neurosarcoidosis were performed for all patients [7] [8] [9] . At the time of diagnosis, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood count, CSF analyses (cell counts and phenotypes, protein and glucose content, polymerase chain reaction tests for herpes simplex virus, oligoclonal bands, immunoglobulin-G, lactate, angiotensin converting enzyme), serum serologic tests for bacterial (salmonella, brucella, borreliosis, and mycoplasma pneumoniae) and viral infections (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus), and serum chemistry (serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels and immunoglobulin-G) were obtained. All physical and neurologic examinations performed in the hospital and during outpatient follow-up were performed by the same pediatric neurologist (IE).",

Patients showing continued deterioration were also administered IVIG (2 g/kg) divided over 2 days.

Due to recurrent attacks, one girl was put on daily prednisolone. Since new attacks occurred daily under prednisolone, she was also prescribed azathioprine and then daily azathioprine alone. In case 5, because clinical findings were improved spontaneously when MRI was applied, neither IVIG nor steroid treatment was given.

The presenting symptoms in the current series (Table 1) were gait disturbance (12 cases), altered consciousness (10 cases), behavioral changes (five cases), fever (seven cases), headache (four cases), seizures (four cases), meningismus (four cases), and vomiting (three cases). Analysis of CSF revealed pleocytosis or increased protein concentrations in the majority of patients with ADEM. However, the CSF can also be normal. Oligoclonal bands are seen in some patients with ADEM but are a nonspecific finding more often associated with MS 6, 10 . In this study, lymphocytic pleocytosis was detected in five patients and mild CSF protein elevation in four patients (Table 2 ). Tenembaum et al. 8 reported that in a series of 84 children with 54 CSF samples analyzed, none showed oligoclonal bands. However, CSF-restricted oligoclonal immunoglobulin-G bands were detectable in as many as 58% of patients with ADEM, according to recent reviews 15, 16 . In the present study, only one case had oligoclonal banding. Previous studies associated the presence of oligoclonal bands in CSF with a higher probability of MS 6, [17] [18] [19] . However, the single patient in the current study experienced no new attacks during 2.6 years of follow-up (although the possibly of MS in the future cannot be excluded).",

New deficits within 3 months of onset are considered to be part of the same acute episode. Additional ADEM episodes occur rarely and happen in two main contexts: recurrent ADEM and multiphasic ADEM 2 . The frequency of relapsing ADEM or ADEM progressing to MS has varied significantly among studies 14, 18, [20] [21] [22] . One patient in the present study was considered to have possible MS based on clinical and radiologic recurrence. International consensus definitions for MS require two subsequent non-ADEM demyelinating events in children with an initial ADEM event 2 . Banwell et al. 23 reported that 50-70% of pediatric MS cases had a polyfocal presentation and 30-50% had a monofocal presentation. Although MS is more commonly preceded by clinically isolated syndrome, there have been cases in which the initial presentation met criteria for ADEM. At what point a patient presenting with ADEM who has a subsequent event not associated with encephalopathy should be reclassified as MS remains unclear 2 . On the other hand, a review of 1540 childhood cases of MS showed that the first attack was more likely to be characterized by polyfocal features and encephalopathy (ADEMlike) 23 . A child with possible MS in the present study had altered mental status (lethargy) as well, so altered mental status was of no predictive value for subsequent MS in this series. Intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal bands was detected in over 90% of children with MS 24 . However, oligoclonal bands can be absent initially and are only detected later in the MS disease course 23 , and the one case with possible MS in the current study did not exhibit oligoclonal bands.",

            "text": "MRI is a more sensitive modality for diagnosis of ADEM than CT 14, 20 . Of the 14 patients who had head CT scans, only three exhibited lesions consistent with ADEM (Table 3) compared with 100% by MRI. This implies that ADEM is likely to be diagnosed with greater frequency as MRI becomes available in more regions and is used more often in pediatric medicine. The presentations of ADEM as revealed by MRI are variable. Lesions associated with ADEM are typically bilateral but may be asymmetric and tend to have poorly defined margins. Almost all patients in the current series had multiple lesions in the deep and subcortical white matter, while the periventricular white matter was generally spared. The thalamus and basal ganglia are frequently affected, and lesions in these locations are often symmetrical. Brainstem and spinal cord abnormalities on MRI are common in ADEM 8, 11, 13, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Only four patients featured isolated cerebral lesions, whereas the other 11 showed additional involvement of the brainstem (six cases), spinal cord (six cases), cerebellum (five cases), and thalamus (three cases). These lesion distributions, including common cerebral lesions in frontal and parietal subcortical white matter, are generally consistent with previous observations. Tenembaum et al. 8 divided ADEM MRI findings into four groups: small lesions (<5 mm), large confluent white matter lesions, symmetric bilateral lesions with thalamic involvement, and large demyelinating acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis. Liao et al. 30 suggest that ADEM is a broad spectrum disease and that patients showing bilateral large confluent lesions, focal demyelination lesions, or pure bilateral basal ganglia or bilateral thalamic lesions on MRI have classic ADEM and have a lower probability of progression to MS compared with patients with multiple small ovoid lesions. By this definition, all of the patients in the current study should be considered classic ADEM cases. Follow-up imaging after ADEM is typified by complete or near-complete lesion resolution and by the absence of new lesion formation. By contrast, follow-up imaging of MS usually demonstrates new, often asymptomatic, lesions 8, 10, 23, 31 . Fourteen of the patients in the current study had complete or partial resolution of the lesions as evidenced by follow-up MRI. However, one patient had five new symptomatic or asymptomatic lesions (Table 3) .",

ADEM has a wide range of neurologic presentations in children and should be considered in a child who develops multifocal neurologic abnormalities with encephalopathy following a febrile infectious illness. Early treatment with immunomodulative agents is recommended and is likely to result in a favorable outcome or even full recovery. On the other hand, this study shows the benefits of antiviral and antibiotic treatment initiated as soon as possible after the onset of illness. In 13 of 15 patients in this series, all neurologic signs and symptoms resolved after treatment. Only one patient recovered with severe neurologic sequelae and the remaining patient, who experienced recurrent attacks, was ultimately diagnosed with possible MS. It is still difficult to accurately predict progression to MS. Therefore, prolonged follow-up is required to establish a final diagnosis. Comprehensive long-term monitoring of such patients may provide additional information useful for etiologic insight and prognosis in this region.",
