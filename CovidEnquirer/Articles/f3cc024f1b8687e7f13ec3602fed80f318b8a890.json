Using the native pentapeptidylthioester substrates, GrsB PCP-TE catalyzes the dimerization and subsequent formation of the decapeptide lactam gramicidin S. Interestingly, the detection of linear decapeptidyl-SNAC as an enzyme-dependent intermediate supports the iterative mechanism in vivo, in which two pentapeptides, one bound as an ester to the active site serine of the TE domain and the second bound as a thioester to the adjacent pan-PCP, are ligated to a decapeptidyl-pan-PCP that subsequently transferred to the adjacent TE domain and cyclized. Moreover, GrsB PCP-TE can handle different substrates length, leading not only to dimerization, but also to trimerization and the formation of different ring sizes.",

A common feature of such nonribosomally synthesized bioactive peptides is their macrocyclic structure, which causes reduction in structural flexibility and may therefore constrain them into the biologically active conformation [2] . Macrocyclic products are released from NRPS assembly lines usually by the action of Cterminal thioesterase domains (TE domains, cyclases). These accomplish product release by diverse mechanisms, mainly including a head-to-tail or branched side chain cyclization resulting in the formation of the final cyclic product [3, 4] . Excised TE domains, separated from their biosynthetic machinery, are active enzymes in vitro when provided with substrate mimics. Due to the fact that stereoselective peptide cyclization is a difficult task in organic synthesis, chemoenzymatic methods have emerged for the production of natural products and their derivatives [5] . These approaches combine substrate generation by solid-phase peptide synthesis and stereoselective cyclization utilizing excised TE domains.",

Best characterized are the linear NRPSs (Type A), which are exemplified by the tyrocidine and the surfactin synthetases [1] . In these systems, the sequence of the assembled peptide chain is entirely determined by the number and order of modules within the corresponding peptide synthetase. Several TE domains of linear NRPSs are biochemically and structurally well characterized and are frequently used in chemoenzymatic approaches to generate macrocyclic peptide derivatives [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In contrast, iterative (Type B) and nonlinear (Type C) NRPS assembly line templates are more complex. For example, iterative synthetases use their modules and domains more than once to assemble their final products from repetitive building blocks. Prominent candidates for the iterative mechanism are the antibiotic gramicidin S, the siderophore enterobactin, the antitumor agent thiocoraline, and the potent anti-SARS-CoV valinomycin, as well as the anticancer drug bleomycin and the siderophore yersiniabactin for nonlinear NRPS-PKS hybrids [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . To clarify the mechanistic aspects and to explore the biocombinatorial potential of the iterative reaction, we investigated the TE domain of the gramicidin S synthetase for its substrate specificity, ligation capacity, and cyclization potential.",

            "text": "Gramicidin S is a potent and well-characterized antibiotic synthesized by Bacillus brevis [14] . It is a cyclic decapeptide with the primary structure cyclo(-D-Phe 1 -L-Pro 2 -L-Val 3 -L-Orn 4 -L-Leu 5 -D-Phe 6 -L-Pro 7 -L-Val 8 -L-Orn 9 -L-Leu 10 -), which is assembled on the GrsA and GrsB peptide synthetases that comprise one and four modules, respectively ( Figure 1 ). The modular organization of the peptide synthetases suggests a mechanism in which the gramicidin TE (GrsB TE) serves as a holding bay for the gramicidin linear pentapeptide intermediate. After formation of the first pentapeptide, the TE domain awaits the assembly of the second pentapeptide and catalyzes the dimerization and the release of the cyclic decapeptide lactam. This type of mechanism was first proposed by Stoll et al. back in 1970 and was previously supported by mass spectrometric studies on the TE domain of the iterative enterobactin (Ent) synthetase [15, 20] . Early studies also discussed enzyme dimerization, and they determined that the utilization of two TE domains to catalyze this two-step mechanism would lead to the same product. However, this seems rather unlikely, as it has been shown for GrsA and the iterative enterobactin synthetase EntF, harboring the TE domain, that NRPSs work as monomers [21] .",

To define the borders of the TE domain, we performed sequence alignments, which revealed that the published borders of gramicidin thioesterase [7] comprise about 25 amino acid residues as an N-terminal extension compared to most characterized linear TE domains [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Sequence alignments of GrsB TE with the iterative TE domains of EntF, DhbF, and TioS revealed that this N-terminal extension seems to be a unique feature of GrsB TE ( Figure 2 ). Based on these sequence alignments, it was possible to define two putative N-terminal borders of the GrsB TE domain. Based on this finding, a long version (TE Long , 33 kDa, 275 residues) and a short version (TE Short , 30 kDa, 250 residues) were cloned and expressed in the soluble and active forms ( Figure S1 ). Comparison of the reaction time courses of GrsB PCP-TE and GrsB TE Long incubated with the pentapeptidylthioester and the decapeptidyl-thioester revealed similar rates of product formation. In contrast, GrsB TE Short catalyzes a 5-fold slower product formation. Due to good solubility and the best yields of the GrsB PCP-TE, all further experiments were conducted with this construct.",

            "text": "A common mechanistic feature in iterative NRPS systems is the ability to combine two or more identical monomers. Therefore, the major question for excised GrsB PCP-TE was whether the recombinant protein is able to catalyze an iterative reaction in vitro. For this purpose, we synthesized the native pentapeptidyl-SNAC and -thiophenol substrates, GS5 SNAC , GS5 SPh (Table 1) , respectively, and incubated them with the GrsB PCP-TE. In both cases, the HPLC trace revealed that GrsB PCP-TE catalyzes the dimerization of the pentapeptides to a decapeptide and its subsequent cyclization, resulting in the formation of gramicidin S (t R = 43.1) ( Figures 3B  and 3C ). The formation of gramicidin S in this reaction occurred with a k cat value of 0.4 min \u00c01 for GS5 SNAC and a k cat value of 2.4 min \u00c01 for GS5 SPh . Taking into account that the linear gramicidin substrate possesses two nucleophiles, L-Orn 4 and the N terminus of D-Phe 1 , MS-MS sequencing of the cyclic decapeptide was conducted. The results obtained excluded the possibility that L-Orn 4 is involved in ring formation. Cyclization is exclusively mediated through a nucleophilic attack of the a amino group of D-Phe 1 ; fragment ions proving the predicted linkage of D-Phe 1 to L-Leu 5 were unambiguously identified (Figure S2 ). In addition to the main product, gramicidin S, and hydrolysis of the pentamer, linear decapeptidyl-SNAC (5+5) and a 15-membered ring (5+5+5) (at low concentrations) consisting of three pentapeptide monomers were detected as side products (ratio hydrolysis/gramicidin S: 1/4). In the case of GS5 SPh , such a linear decepeptidyl intermediate was not observed (ratio hydrolysis/ gramicidin S: 1/3). Interestingly, GS5 SPh forms a 5-membered ring in an enzyme-independent reaction, which is not observed with the SNAC-activated substrate. Comparison of the assay conducted with and without enzyme showed that the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is faster than the uncatalyzed formation of the 5-membered ring. For stability reasons, we used peptidyl-SNACs instead of thiophenols for all further studies.",

For this purpose, single amino acid residues in the native pentapeptide substrate were exchanged stepwise for alanine and were screened for the formation of the corresponding decapeptides. Substrates substituted in positions 2 (L-Pro 2 ), 3 (L-Val 3 ), and 4 (L-Orn 4 ) revealed the formation of a 10-membered ring with the corresponding linear SNAC intermediate and small amounts of the 15-membered ring, indicating the tolerance of GrsB PCP-TE for those positions within the pentapeptide (Tables 1 and 2 , the ratio of hydrolysis/linear and cyclic products is: GS5 SNAC , 1/4; GS5 Ala2 , 1/2.5; GS5 Ala3 , 6/1; GS5 Ala4 , 1/1.5). The velocity of the reaction was about the same for the tested substrates (conversion of substrate after 10 min: GS5 SNAC , 11%; GS5 Ala2 , 6%; GS5 Ala3 , 9%; GS5 Ala4 , 9%). Interestingly, in the assays with the alanine pentapeptide derivatives, the ratio of the 15-membered ring to the 10-membered ring is different (ratio 10membered ring/15-membered ring: GS5 SNAC , 6/1; GS5 Ala2 , 5/1; GS5 Ala3 , 2/1; GS5 Ala4 , n.d.). To corroborate these results, we determined the kinetic parameters for the cyclization reaction of the corresponding SNAC decapeptides GS10 Ala2,7 , GS10 Ala3,8 , and GS10 Ala4,9 (Tables 1 and 2 ; GS10 Ala2,7 : K M , 357 mM, k cat , 4 min \u00c01 ; GS10 Ala3,8 : K M , 485 mM, k cat , 3.4 min \u00c01 ). Unfortunatley, we had solubility problems with GS10 Ala4,9 ; thus, we were not able to determine kinetic parameters. Additionally, we altered the configuration of the amino acids at positions 1 and 5. Substrates carrying D-Leu at the C terminus (GS5 D-Leu5 and GS10 D-Leu10 ) showed low hydrolysis rates, whereas substrates carrying L-Phe at the N terminus (GS5 L-Phe1 and GS10 L-Phe1 ) were mainly hydrolyzed.

These results indicate that the dipeptide GS2 seems to be too short for the conversion catalyzed by the thioesterase. By using additional substrates of varying lengths it was possible to detect, in addition to hydrolysis, the formation of different ring sizes.

As iterative TE domains mediate the linkage of smaller monomers before cyclization, the question of whether the excised GrsB PCP-TE can potentially act as a ligase arises. To test this ability, we had to impede the GrsB PCP-TE from acting as a cyclase. This was achieved by blocking either the N or C terminus of the suitable linear monomers. In a first set of experiments, we incubated GrsB PCP-TE with a pentapeptide, GS5 OH , that was not activated as a thioester. As expected, no conversion was detectable. Additionally, an activated pentapeptidyl-SNAC, GS5 NAc , that was Nterminally acylated, was constructed. Assaying this substrate with GrsB PCP-TE resulted exclusively in hydrolysis, whereas coincubation of both substrates, GS5 OH and GS5 NAc , led to the ligation of these pentapeptides, which, in turn, resulted in a linear decapeptide (ratio ligation/hydrolysis: 1/2, using 300 mM of each substrate). This reaction clearly indicated the ability of GrsB PCP-TE to catalyze a ligation reaction. Following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, this ligation reaction was determined to a k cat of 4.9 min \u00c01 and a K M of 0.62 mM for GS5 OH and a k cat of 7.3 min \u00c01 and a K M of 1.1 mM for GS5 NAc .",

            "text": "Iterative Gramicidin Thioesterase Dimerization activity by TE domains of linear NRPSs has been described only once thus far [13] . Here, the gramicidin S pentapeptidyl-SNAC was used in combination with the excised tyrocidine TE, leading to hydrolysis as the major product and small amounts of dimerized and cyclized products. In comparison, dimerization and cyclization catalyzed by GrsB PCP-TE is indeed slower, but they are only accompanied by low rates of hydrolysis (ratio cycle(5+5)/hydrolysis 4/1 for GS5 SNAC ). Kinetic investigations show that the conversion of the pentapeptide into gramicidin S is slower than the conversion of the decapeptide, possibly due to the fact that the ligation reaction of the pentapeptide is the rate-determining step. Using the pentapeptidyl-SNAC as the substrate, a decapeptidyl-SNAC was generated in an enzyme-dependent reaction. The detection of this decapeptidyl-SNAC gave rise to speculations about the mechanism of iterative TE domains. The SNAC intermediate can be formed by the nucleophilic attack of the amino group of a free SNAC pentapeptide on the peptidylester of the TE-bound pentapeptide. If the free amino group of the TE-bound substrate would attack the thioester of the SNAC-activated peptide, only hydrolyzed linear substrates could be detected as side products. These observations can also aid in the understanding of the reaction catalyzed by iterative thioesterases in vivo. For the enterobactin synthetase, Shaw-Reid et al. [15] postulated that the first monomer is built up by the synthetase and is subsequently transferred to the active site serine of the TE domain. The second monomer is presented by the pan-arm of the PCP domain adjacent to Ent-TE. The ligation reaction results in a dimer bound as an ester to the active site serine of the TE domain. Two possible mechanisms for this elongation reaction can be postulated ( Figure 5 ). Either the amino group of the first monomer bound to the TE domain nucleophilicaly attacks the second monomer presented by the pan-PCP, resulting in a dimer bound to the active site serine of the TE domain (forward reaction), or the amino group of the PCP-bound substrate attacks the TE-bound monomer, resulting in a dimer bound to the PCP domain, that is subsequently transferred to the active site serine of the TE domain for cyclization (backward reaction). According to our results, there is strong evidence that the GrsB TE utilizes the backward reaction, as we were able to detect the formation of the decapeptidyl-SNAC. To date, it cannot be verified whether the decapeptidyl-SNAC is a side product or an intermediate of the reaction. In the forward reaction, a second catalytic center would be required to catalyze the ligation reaction because the serine of the catalytic triad is blocked by the first monomer. Comprehensive sequence alignments of several TE domains revealed that the gramicidin TE domain has an extension of about 25 amino acids ( Figure 2 ). Expression of this longer version of the GrsB TE domain (GrsB TE Long ) published by Kohli et al. [7] , and a short version (GrsB TE Short ) missing the 25 amino acids resulted in comparable dimerization and cyclization activity. Although the obtained products were found in equal parts, the catalytic efficiency of GrsB TE Short is 5-fold lower, indicating an important role of the N-terminal extension for protein stability. Also, the iterative gramicidin TE domain has a longer linker region between the PCP and the TE domain that was not observed in other PCP-TE junctions. This extended linker region may be important for flexibility of the thioesterase needed to catalyze two different reactions: the ligation of two substrates and intramolecular cyclization. Structural analysis of this iterative TE might provide insights into these mechanistic issues.",

The heptapeptide GS7 is elongated once, and subsequent cyclization led to a 14-membered ring. The 14-membered ring likewise has a stabilized b sheet structure that is preferred to an unstabilized 7-membered ring. This indicates that the elongation and subsequent cyclization to an energetically favored ring size is preferred by GrsB PCP-TE. Larger peptides containing more than seven amino acids were exclusively cyclized. Although the larger 18-membered ring is believed to have a b sheet structure, this cyclization was not observed when the TE domain was incubated with the nonapeptide GS9; instead, a 9-membered ring was exclusively formed. This can be explained by the maximum capacity of the catalytic pocket of the thioesterase. GrsB PCP-TE can sufficiently cyclize linear peptides consisting of 6-15 amino acids, reflecting the high variability, flexibility, and limitation of the binding pocket. For the tetrapeptide GS4, an 8-membered (4+4) and 12-membered (4+4+4) ring were observed. These products are not in accordance with the b sheet rule. It becomes clear that b sheet structures are impossible to assemble by monomers of this size.

Here, we present a comprehensive in vitro characterization of the excised iterative, bimodular PCP-TE of the gramicidin S synthetase GrsB. We show that the TE domain catalyzes the ligation and subsequent cyclization of peptidyl-SNAC and -thiophenols. Detection of linear thioester intermediates supports a mechanism in vivo, in which the ligation product of the two pentapeptides is transferred backward to the PCP domain to be cyclized by the TE domain afterwards (backward reaction).

In the backward reaction (indicated by red arrows), the amino group of pentapeptidyl-pan-PCP attacks the ester of the pentapeptide attached to the thioesterase.

Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 mM enzyme and were quenched after 90 min by the addition of 10 ml 4% TFA/H 2 O. In order to verify the role of the thioesterase in these reactions, a control without enzyme in which the formation of products was completely abolished was always performed. Assays were analyzed by RP-LCMS (Agilent 1100 MSD) on a Nucleodur 125/3 C 18 (ec) column (Macherey and Nagel; pore diameter, 100 \u00c5 ; particle size, 3 mm) utilizing the following gradient: 0-40 min, 5%-60% MeCN/0.1% TFA into H 2 O/0.1% TFA, 40-45 min, 60%-95% MeCN/0.1% TFA into H 2 O/0.1% TFA, 0.5 ml/min, 40 C; the identities of the products were verified by ESI-MS.Kinetic characterizations of the dimerization and cyclization reactions were performed by determining initial rates at 5-8 substrate concentrations by using 2 time points at each concentration within the linear region of the reaction. Kinetic parameters of the ligation reaction were determined by using one substrate in excess and by varying the other substrate concentration. The concentrations of all thioester substrates were calculated by using experimentally determined extinction coefficients at a wavelength of 215 nm. Concentrations of products were calculated by comparison with synthesized linear peptides with identical sequences. Assays were analyzed by RP-LCMS (Agilent 1100 MSD) on a Nucleodur 125/2 C 18 (ec) column (Macherey and Nagel; pore diameter, 100 \u00c5 ; particle size, 3 mm) with the following gradients: native penta-and decapeptide substrates activated as thioester: 0-35 min, 5%-90% MeCN/0.1% TFA into H 2 O/0.1% TFA, 0.4 ml/min, 45 C; ligation of GS5 OH and GS5 SNAC : 0-45 min, 5%-90% MeOH/0.1% TFA into H 2 O/0.1% TFA, 0.4 ml/min, 45 C.",
