            "text": "RNA degradation by RNase L during 2-5A-mediated decay (2-5AMD) is a conserved mammalian stress response to viral and endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). 2-5AMD onsets rapidly and facilitates a switch of protein synthesis from homeostasis to production of interferons (IFNs). To understand the mechanism of this protein synthesis reprogramming, we examined 2-5AMD in human cells. 2-5AMD triggers polysome collapse characteristic of a translation initiation defect, but translation initiation complexes and ribosomes purified from the translation-arrested cells remain functional. Using spike-in RNA-seq we found that basal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) rapidly decay, while mRNAs encoding IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes evade 2-5AMD and accumulate. The IFN evasion results from the combined effect of better mRNA stability and positive feedback amplification in the IFN response. Therefore, 2-5AMD and transcription act in concert to revamp the cellular mRNA composition. The resulting preferential accumulation of innate immune mRNAs establishes \"prioritized\" synthesis of defense proteins.",

            "text": "2-5AMD requires the coordinated activity of 2-5A oligonucleotide synthetases (OASs) and the pseudokinase-endoribonuclease, RNase L. The action of the OASs closely parallels that action of a structurally similar dsDNA sensor cGAS. cGAS synthesizes a second messenger cGAMP (cyclic-G 2',5' A 3',5' p) to activate the IFN response via the cGAMP receptor, STING (Civril et al., 2013) . The OASs use the same mechanism of regulation, but function as sensors of dsRNA (Civril et al., 2013; Donovan et al., 2013) . The OASs synthesize the second messenger 2-5A (5'-ppp-A 2'p5' A( 2'p5' A) n\u22650 ) facilitates its dimerization and high-order oligomerization, which provides the switch for activation of RNA cleavage by 2-5AMD (Han et al., 2014; Han et al., 2012) . Upon activation, RNase L cleaves single-stranded RNA molecules at UN^N sites (Floyd-Smith et al., 1981; Han et al., 2014) . The prevalence of this short motif results in 2-5AMD sensitivity of many tRNAs, rRNAs, mRNAs, Y-RNAs and vault RNAs (Cooper et al., 2014b; . During homeostasis, 2-5AMD regulates adhesion and migration activity of mammalian cells (Banerjee et al., 2015; Rath et al., 2015) . Upon acute activation by dsRNA, 2-5AMD arrests global translation by an immediate and poorly understood mechanism (Alisha Chitrakar et al., 2018; . In mammalian cells, dsRNA inhibits translation not only via 2-5AMD, but also via phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2\uf061 by the serine-threonine kinase protein kinase R (PKR) (Fig. 1A ). 2-5AMD and the PKR pathway are separated in time and in A549 human lung epithelial cells, 2-5AMD is the only mechanism responsible for the rapid translational inhibition .",

            "text": "To begin deciphering the mechanism of protein synthesis regulation 2-5AMD, we examined whether it affects polysomes in WT and RNase L -/cells by sucrose gradient sedimentation. In the presence of immunogenic dsRNA (poly-I:C), the 80S monosome peak became dominant within 30 minutes, whereas polysomes progressively and accumulation of the 80S monosomes during 2-5AMD is a signature of inhibited initiation of capped mRNAs. A similar polysome change takes place upon deletion of the RNA helicase DHX29 involved in recognition of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) (Parsyan et al., 2009) or inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that maintains translation initiation active (Gandin et al., 2014) . The 80S species that form upon DHX29 and mTOR defects are non-translating, as are the 80S species formed during 2-5AMD ( Fig. 1C; Fig. S1A ). Non-translating 80S species devoid of mRNA form readily in A549 cells following translation release with puromycin ( Inhibition of mTOR kinase is a common strategy to arrest bulk translation during stress responses (Hsieh et al., 2012; Zoncu et al., 2011) , suggesting that inhibition of translation initiation by 2-5AMD could depend on mTOR. To test this link, we assessed mTOR activity by measuring phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor 4E-BP1 whose phosphorylation by mTOR is required for translation initiation (Feldman et al., 2009 ). Activation of 2-5AMD did not affect 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, whereas a control treatment with the small molecule mTOR inhibitor INK128 (Feldman et al., 2009) worked (Fig. 2B ). Considering that 2-5A and INK128 inhibited bulk translation comparably but with different effects on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation ( Fig. 2A-B) , our data suggest that 2-5AMD inhibits translation initiation independently from mTOR.",

We depleted this lysate of ribosomes by centrifugation (Fig. S3B ) and re-supplied intact ribosomes purified from RRL, A549 cells, or cleaved ribosomes from dsRNA-transfected human cells (Fig. 3C ). Using capped luciferase mRNA translation as the readout, we assessed the activity of each ribosome type. In ribosome-depleted RRL, luciferase translation was absent, suggesting that we obtained a suitable assay. Addition of either rabbit ribosomes from nucleasetreated RRL, intact human ribosomes, or human ribosomes with rRNA degraded by 2-5AMD, readily supported translation. We observed the same specific activity for intact and cleaved ribosomes, which we reproduced over a range of ribosomal concentrations to exclude saturation effects (Fig. 3C ). Therefore, 2-5AMD does not functionally damage human ribosomes even after a nearly complete degradation of full-length rRNA (Fig. 3C, last lane) . In agreement with this observation, the single-exponential decay kinetics for rRNA lags behind the kinetics of translational shutdown (Fig. 3D ). Our data and the previously reported disconnect between rRNA cleavage and translation together indicate that the loss of global translation during 2-5AMD involves a process physically distinct from rRNA degradation.",

Cleavage of a tRNA would satisfy this criterion, and tRNA cleavage has been previously demonstrated . However, even the most sensitive tRNAs were intact at the time of translational inhibition, suggesting that the only RNA substrates that could account for the translational inhibition are mRNAs. RNase L has been shown to cleave exogenous mRNAs, viral mRNAs and select host mRNAs with a preference for longer RNAs with many AU-rich elements due to the specificity of RNase L for UN^N sites (Al-Ahmadi et al., 2009; Le Roy et al., 2007; Nogimori et al., 2018; Rath et al., 2015) . To produce the uniform loss of global translation by mRNA decay, 2-5AMD must act similarly on all housekeeping mRNAs. Indeed, there are no protein bands or protein groups that stand out during the time-dependent progressive loss of translation (Fig. 1C , S1A-B).",

These data suggest that RNase L eliminates the most actively translating mRNAs. As much as 11-12% of the poly-A + RNA is resistant (Fig. 6A ), indicating that resistant mRNAs must be shielded from RNase L, perhaps by being in the nucleus, in phase-separated complexes or in stress granules. The pool of RNase L-resistant poly-A + transcripts is enriched with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs; Fig. 6A ), suggesting that translation could render mRNAs more sensitive to RNase L compared to ncRNAs.

The hypothesized functions ranged from antiviral defense due to viral RNA decay (Cooper et al., 2014a; Han et al., 2004; Nilsen and Baglioni, 1979) to IFN amplification by cleaved self-RNAs (Malathi et al., 2007) or destruction of host RNAs as a mechanism to kill infected cells during the late pro-apoptotic stages of dsRNA sensing (Chakrabarti et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 1997) .

The remaining 11-12% of the poly-A + transcriptome is neither accessible to RNase L nor supporting translation, suggesting that RNase L may have a mechanism to preferentially target translationallyactive endogenous mRNAs.",

The uniform mRNA decay is a central feature of 2-5AMD, which is responsible for arrest of all housekeeping proteins rather than just proteins encoded by long and AU-rich mRNAs. We propose that this uniformity indicates that in live cells mRNAs are cleaved in Briggs-Haldane kinetic regime (Methods). Under Briggs-Haldane conditions, RNase L will cleave mRNAs independently of the binding (K m ) and catalytic constants (k cat ) of individual mRNAs, thereby acquiring a mechanism for uniform decay of the transcriptome. A notable feature of Briggs-Haldane regime is that once RNase L encounters an mRNA, it makes a cut before dissociating, i.e. every RNase L-mRNA binding event is productive. In cell extracts, RNase L is sensitive to length and AU content in mRNAs, indicating cleavage under Michaelis-Menten regime. Although it remains to be explained precisely how live .

This model agrees with the recently proposed mechanism for Dom34 rescue of RNase L-ribosome complex, which postulates a translation-dependent mRNA cleavage mechanism (Nogimori et al., 2018) . If ribosome-RNase L recognition (rather than mRNA-RNase L recognition) determines kinetics mRNA decay by RNase L, 2-5AMD would target all actively translating mRNAs. Further, RNase L could dwell on translating ribosomes, which would ensure efficient cleavage of mRNAs and achieve Briggs-Haldane conditions. The decay rate constants are similar, within several-fold, for basal mRNAs and for mRNAs encoding IFNs ( Fig. 4C; 6F ). We show that once this several-fold stability advantage is coupled with the positive feedback of the IFN response, defense mRNAs become desensitized to RNase L. A minimal model with experimentally determined kinetic parameters can account for decay of basal mRNAs and explain how IFNs and ISGs can accumulate to nearly the same levels in WT and RNase L -/cells ( Fig. 7A-B) .",

The RNA-seq data agreed well with our qPCR analysis (Fig. 5B). Reads for all decaying mRNAs disappeared across the entire transcript length, suggesting that once RNase L endonucleolytically cleaves a transcript, the resulting mRNA fragments are rapidly cleared. The decay kinetics determined from the top 5000 most abundant transcripts matches the time scale of translational inhibition (Fig. S4B; 4C). Together, our qPCR and RNA-seq data link translation arrest by 2-5AMD to mRNA decay, which can explain the accumulation of empty 80S monosomes in cells.",

It is important to note that positive feedback in the IFN response involves not only RNase L-sensitive mediators (IFN/ISG mRNAs), but also RNase L-resistant activators (accumulation of IFN proteins and phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT)(Fig. 7A). We developed a mathematical description of this positive feedback model to examine whether it predicts survival of defense mRNAs in the presence of RNase L. To define experimental parameters, we used the key observations that (1) basal mRNAs are downregulated by ~100-fold after 4 hours, (2) 2-5AMD has a small effect on the dynamics of defense mRNAs, and (3) measured halflives of defense mRNAs are longer than half-lives of basal mRNAs (Fig. S7A; Fig. 6F).A simple model with positive feedback and similar 2-5AMD sensitivity of all mRNAs predicts equal attenuation by RNase L of basal and transcriptionally induced mRNAs(Fig. 7B). Therefore, positive feedback per se is not protecting defense mRNAs",
