            "text": "The replicase of mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM) is encoded by two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, which are translated to produce a 750-kDa precursor polyprotein. The polyprotein is proposed to be processed by viral proteinases to generate the functional replicase complex. To date, only the MHV-JHM amino-terminal proteins p28 and p72, which is processed to p65, have been identified. To further elucidate the biogenesis of the MHV-JHM replicase, we cloned and expressed five regions of ORF1a in bacteria and prepared rabbit antisera to each region. Using the immune sera to immunoprecipitate radiolabeled proteins from MHV-JHM infected cells, we determined that the MHV-JHM ORF1a is initially processed to generate p28, p72, p250, and p150. Pulse\u00b1chase analysis revealed that these intermediates are further processed to generate p65, p210, p40, p27, the MHV 3C-like proteinase, and p15. A putative replicase complex consisting of p250, p210, p40, p150, and a large protein (\u03fe300 kDa) coprecipitate from infected cells disrupted with NP-40, indicating that these proteins are closely associated even after initial proteolytic processing. Immunofluorescence studies revealed punctate labeling of ORF1a proteins in the perinuclear region of infected cells, consistent with a membrane-association of the replicase complex. Furthermore, in vitro transcription/translation studies of the MHV-JHM 3Cpro and flanking hydrophobic domains confirm that 3C protease activity is significantly enhanced in the presence of canine microsomal membranes. Overall, our results demonstrate that the MHV-JHM ORF1a polyprotein: (1) is processed into more than 10 protein intermediates and products, (2) requires membranes for efficient biogenesis, and (3) is detected in discrete membranous regions in the cytoplasm of infected cells.",

Nido, Latin for`\u01f9est,'' was chosen for this order since the two virus families in the order, the Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae, synthesize a 3\u0408-nested set of mRNAs. Furthermore, the nested set of mRNAs is generated by an unusual discontinuous transcription process in which a short leader RNA sequence and the body sequence of the mRNA are joined (Baric et al., 1983; Lai et al., 1994; Spaan et al., 1983; van der Most and Spaan, 1995) . The mechanism by which this discontinuous transcription occurs to generate the nested set of mRNAs is controversial (Jeong and Makino, 1994; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990; Sethna et al., 1989 ; van Marle et al., 1995; Zhang and Lai, 1995) . However, it is clear that the enzyme that mediates discontinuous transcription is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or replicase. By understanding how this replicase is generated and functions throughout the infection cycle, we may gain insight regarding how it mediates the unusual mechanism of discontinuous RNA synthesis.",

Immunoprecipitations with these antisera led to the identification of two high-molecularweight proteins with apparent migrations of 250 and 210 kDa (Figs. 1 A\u00b11C, lane 4). Longer exposure of the anti-D3 immunoprecipitation revealed proteins of 72 and 65 kDa (Fig. 1A , lane 4), confirming our earlier report of these products (Gao et al., 1996) . In addition, we noted proteins with apparent migrations of 180 and 50 kDa which are nonspecifically recognized by all preimmune and immune sera from infected cell lysates. These bands likely reflect some nonspecific immunoprecipitation of the highly abundant spike (180 kDa) and nucleocapsid (50 kDa) proteins produced during viral replication, as has been previously reported (Denison et al., 1992 . Taken together, the immunoprecipitation results suggest that p250 and p210 may be co-amino terminal (as both are precipitated by anti-D3, which extends only 14.2 kDa into the predicted p250 region), and both proteins extend to at least aa 2820 (as both are precipitated by anti-D10).",

Immunoprecipitation of these lysates with anti-D3, anti-D5, and anti-D10 sera revealed a gradual decline in the intensity of p250 and concomitant increase in the intensity of p210, suggesting that p250 and p210 have a precursor\u00b1product relationship. We also expected to find a protein of approximately 40 kDa which would represent the remaining cleavage product of p250. However, we have been unable to detect p40 using this method. Therefore, we cannot yet definitively conclude whether p210 is co-amino-or cocarboxy-terminal with p250. Amino-terminal sequencing of p250 and p210 will be required to determine if they are truly co-amino-terminal, and at which precise amino acid they begin. To date, we have been unable to purify sufficient quantities of these proteins for amino-terminal sequencing studies.",

To determine if the MHV-JHM ORF1a processing is distinct from MHV-A59, we analyzed radiolabeled A59 and JHM lysates by immunoprecipitation with anti-D3 serum and SDS\u00b1PAGE ( Fig. 2A) . As seen in lanes 5 and 6, the high molecular mass proteins from both virus strains migrate identically under denaturing conditions in a 5\u00b115% gradient SDS\u00b1polyacrylamide gel. According to our molecular mass determinations (see Materials and Methods), these proteins migrate with apparent masses of 250 and 210 kDa. Furthermore, these molecular mass estimates are consistent with the expected molecular mass calculated for the region bounded by p72 and the downstream protein p150 described below (see Fig. 7 and Table 3 ). Interestingly, the p72 protein appears to be unique to the MHV-JHM strain.

Pulse\u00b1chase analysis with anti-D12 serum suggests a precursor and product relationship between p150 and p27, as reflected by the appearance of p27 30 min into the chase, and the concomitant decrease in intensity of p150 (Fig. 3C ). This result is consistent with proteolytic cleavages mediated by 3Cpro occurring at Gln/Ser cleavage sites upstream and downstream of the 3Cpro catalytic center, as has been reported for MHV-A59 (Lu et al., 1996) . The detection of p150 is the first report of a precursor to 3Cpro. We propose that the p150 extends from a putative cleavage site upstream of the hydrophobic domain termed MP1 (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991) to the end of ORF1a (Val 4474). The predicted molecular weight for this region is 150.5 kDa, similar to the apparent molecular weight of 150 kDa on SDS\u00b1PAGE gels (Table 3) .",

We routinely use highly denatured total cell lysates (prepared using lysis buffer A as described under Materials and Methods) for immunoprecipitations. As shown above (Fig. 1) , these conditions facilitate specific detection of MHV-JHM ORF1a gene products. Interestingly, when cell lysates were prepared using NP-40 lysis followed by isolation of postnuclear supernatants (lysis buffer B, see Materials and Methods), we detected coprecipitation of viral proteins, indicating that these proteins likely reside in the cell as a complex. Under these conditions, all five antisera described above precipitate viral proteins of \u03fe300 kDa, p250, p210, and p150 (Fig. 4) . A protein of approximately 40 kDa is also detected using the anti-D3, anti-D5, and anti-D10 sera. In pulse\u00b1chase analyses of NP-40 lysates with these same three antisera, p40 is seen to accumulate during the chase concomitant with the increase in p210 and decrease in p250 intensities (data not shown). This viral p40 likely represents the additional cleavage product generated when p250 is cleaved to generate p210. Since neither the anti-D3 nor anti-D10 serum specifically immunoprecipitates this product, it is unclear if p40 represents the amino-or carboxy-terminal cleavage product of p250. The large (\u03fe300 kDa) protein likely represents an ORF1a/ORF1b polyprotein generated by ribosomal frameshifting during translation. In addition to the highmolecular-weight proteins, some specific products are also detected: p65 using anti-D3 (Fig. 4 , lane 2), p27 using anti-D12 (lane 8), and p15 using anti-D15 (lane 10). The specific precipitation of the lower molecular-weight proteins demonstrates the specificity of the antisera. The coprecipitation of the high molecular weight proteins under these conditions is consistent with the hypothesis that the MHV polymerase exists as a complex of ORF1a/ ORF1b cleavage products in vivo.",

DBT cells were infected with MHV-JHM, fixed with formaldehyde at 5.5\u00b16.0 h after infection, and incubated with specific antisera as described under Materials and Methods. MHV ORF1a products were detected using anti-D3 and anti-D12 antisera (Fig. 5) . Both antisera revealed a similar, and somewhat polar, punctate staining pattern in the perinuclear region of infected cells. This pattern is consistent with MHV replicase association with discrete vesicular structures in the cells. Although not all gene 1 cleavage products are predicted to contain hydrophobic domains, it is possible that strong protein\u00b1protein interactions hold the subunits together in a membrane-associated complex. The MHV ORF1a localization we see is similar to the pattern of localization reported for ORF1b proteins in equine arteritis virus (EAV)-infected cells (van Dinten et al., 1996) . Further studies will be required to determine the precise subcellular localization site of the MHV replicase complex.",

Identification of the precursor and processed forms of the C-terminal region of ORF1a by immunoprecipitation with specific antisera. Immunoprecipitations and pulse\u00b1chase analyses were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 , using anti-D12 (A and C) and anti-D15 (B, D, and E) antisera. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 5\u00b115% gradient SDS\u00b1PAGE (A\u00b1D) or 15% (E) gels and visualized by fluorography. U, uninfected cell lysates; I, infected cell lysates; pre, immunoprecipitations using preimmune sera; remaining lanes immunoprecipitated with the indicated immune sera.

Molecular mass markers are indicated on the left, and exposure lengths are indicated below each gel. necessary for in vitro 3Cpro protease activity (Tibbles et al., 1996) . However, for MHV-A59 it has been demonstrated that 3Cpro (p27) does not strictly require membranes for in vitro trans-cleavage activity (Lu et al., 1996) , but that it does require membranes for efficient activity if major portions of the flanking hydrophobic domains are present in the expression constructs (Pin \u00c4o \u00c2 n et al., 1997) . To investigate the activity of the MHV-JHM 3Cpro, the predicted protease domain along with the full-length flanking hydrophobic domains (MP1 and MP2, membrane proteins 1 and 2) were cloned into the in vitro expression vector pET-11d under T7 promoter control and tested for protease activity in the presence and absence of membranes. A mutant 3Cpro construct was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis, resulting in a substitution of the catalytic cysteine residue with an arginine residue (Table 1) . Both wild type and mutant 3Cpro constructs were cotranscribed/translated in vitro with [ 35 S]methionine in the absence and presence of CMMs, and equal TCA-precipitable counts of each reaction were analyzed by SDS\u00b1PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 6) . Comparison of lanes 1 and 2 from this experiment indicates that the p27 cleavage product (3Cpro) is generated more efficiently from the 91 kDa translation product in the presence of CMMs (Fig. 6, lane  2) . This may be due to an effect of membranes on the conformation of the proteinase itself or to an alteration in accessibility of the cleavage sites. Longer exposures of the gel in Fig. 6 show small quantities of p27 generated in the absence of membranes, in lane 1 (data not shown). As expected, pET-mut3Cpro does not generate p27 in the absence or presence of membranes (lanes 3 and 4) . These results are consistent with the observations of Pin \u00c4o \u00c2 n et al. (1997) in that 3C processing events specifically leading to the release of p27 in vitro can occur in the absence of exogenously added membranes, but that they are greatly enhanced in the presence of CMMs. Finally, these data support the hypothesis that 3Cpro likely needs to be associated with intracellular membranes for efficient activity during virus infection.",

Based on apparent molecular masses of proteins identified by immunoprecipitation using antisera generated to ORF1a fusion proteins, as well as the known location of each fusion protein epitope, we deduced that the ORF1a polyprotein is initially cleaved to generate four products, p28, p72, p250, and p150 (Fig. 7) . P28, the amino-terminal cleavage product, is rapidly cleaved and is stable for at least 90 min after processing (Baker et al., 1989; Denison and Perlman, 1986; Gao et al., 1996) . P72, p250, and p150 represent intermediates in the proteolytic processing of ORF1a. P72 is processed to p65 (Gao et al., 1996, and Fig. 1D) . P250 is processed to p210 and p40, with p40 likely representing the carboxy-terminal cleavage product of p250 ( Figs. 1 and 4) . P150, which represents the carboxy-terminal region of ORF1a, is processed to p27, the MHV-JHM 3C-like proteinase, and p15 (Fig. 3) . P150 is likely processed into several additional products as well.",

Identical rates of migration by SDS\u00b1PAGE suggest that the two proteins, which under these conditions migrate with apparent molecular masses of 250 and 210 kDa, likely represent comparable regions of ORF1a from both strains. A processing event which is unique is the generation of p72 in the MHV-JHM strain. Immunoprecipitation of JHM and A59 lysates with anti-D3 ( Fig. 2A) and anti-647 sera (H. Q. Gao and S. C. Baker, unpublished observations) demonstrated that the p72 protein is unique to the JHM strain.

The 4474-amino-acid-long ORF1a polyprotein is cleaved to generate a series of intermediates and products depicted here, reflecting results described in this paper. Fusion protein domains used to generate antisera and detect cleavage products are depicted on the amino acid scale at the top. MHV-JHM ORF1a cleavage products are depicted with the observed molecular mass of each protein shown inside each box. Viral proteins labeled 6.0\u00b16.5 h p.i. cleave rapidly to generate p28 and the downstream intermediates p72, p250, and p150. Intermediates are processed at varying rates to generate products p65, p210, p40, p27, and p15, all of which remain stable during a 180-min chase period. The three previously defined cleavage sites at the carboxy-terminus of p28, the carboxy-terminus of p65, and the amino-terminus of 3Cpro (p27) are shown. The G/V and A/G cleavage events are mediated by PCP-1, and the Q/S cleavage is mediated by 3Cpro. The exact amino-and carboxy-termini of all other proteins have not yet been determined, as depicted by the dotted lines. The location of the internal cleavage of p250 which results in the generation of p210 and p40 has not been definitively determined. Question marks indicate putative products that remain to be identified. ucts, and clearly more products await identification. The proteolytic pathway used to generate these protein products is being actively investigated. To date, we know that the first papain-like cysteine proteinase (PCP-1) cleaves at G/V and A/G sites to generate p28 and p65, respectively Dong and Baker, 1994; Hughes et al., 1995) . Based on the size estimates of the cleavage products identified here and an analysis of potential cleavage sites, we speculate that PCP-1 (or potentially the PCP-2 domain located downstream of PCP-1) is responsible for cleavage of p72 and p250. Putative cleavage sites and size estimates of the resulting protein products are listed in Table 3 . The relative positions of p210 and p40 are currently unclear since neither anti-D3 nor anti-D10 serum specifically immunoprecipitates p40. Because the D3 antigen encompasses only the amino terminal 14.2 kDa of p250 and the anti-D3 antiserum detects both p250 and p210, it is likely that p250 and p210 are co-amino-terminal. However, if p250 and p210 are co-amino-terminal, the D10 antiserum should encompass regions of both p210 and p40. It is currently unclear why we are unable to specifically precipitate p40 with any antiserum.",

For the best studied Nidovirus, EAV, the 1727-aa (187-kDa) ORF1a polyprotein is cleaved into at least eight protein products (nsp1\u00b18) by three distinct viral proteinases. Furthermore, alternative (and likely mutually exclusive) major and minor processing pathways for the EAV ORF1a polyprotein have been proposed (Wassenaar et al., 1997) . In addition, provisional mapping of the EAV ORF1b polyprotein suggests that there are at least four ultimate ORF1b cleavage products. However, since proteolytic processing of the EAV ORF1b polyprotein occurs quite slowly, a number of intermediates are also present in EAV-infected cells (van Dinten et al., 1996) .

The cleavage of p250 to p210 and p40 occurs relatively slowly in infected cells, with p250 still detectable 120 min after pulse labeling (Fig. 1) . It is possible that MHV replicase complexes consisting of differentially processed ORF1a products are present in infected cells and exert distinct functions on viral RNA synthesis. In the Sindbis virus system it has been shown that replication of the viral RNA to negative sense and back to positive sense transcripts is regulated by differential processing of a nonstructural protein precursor P123 (de Groot et al., 1990; Lemm and Rice, 1993; Shirako and Strauss, 1994) . Early after Sindbis virus infection, P123 together with nsP4 forms the negative strand replication complex. In contrast, late in infection after the viral nsP2 proteinase has accumulated to significant levels, fully processed nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4 form the positive strand replication complex and shift viral RNA synthesis from the production of negative strand templates to the production of genome-sense transcripts. Similar to Sindbis virus, the coronavirus replicase contains numerous cleavage sites and several proteinase domains responsible for processing the large replicase polyprotein. Accumulation of the viral PCP-1 and 3Cpro proteinases during the course of infection very likely alters the kinetics of trans-cleavage events and the stability of the p72, p250, and p150 processing intermediates which may play distinct regulatory roles in coronavirus genome replication.",

Due to the presence of predicted hydrophobic stretches within the MHV gene 1 polyprotein (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991) , it is thought that some of the mature gene 1 products may be transmembrane proteins which serve to anchor the viral replicase complex to membranes via protein\u00b1protein interactions. In this report, we demonstrate that the MHV-JHM ORF1a proteolytic products are present as a complex in virus-infected cells. When infected cells are disrupted by mild detergent (0.5% NP-40), protein complexes are precipitated with ORF1a antisera (Fig. 4) . These complexes consist of: a high-molecularweight protein (\u03fe300 kDa) which we speculate extends from ORF1a into ORF1b by ribosomal frameshifting during translation; p250, p210, and p40 which represent the central domain of ORF1a and include the two papain-like cysteine proteinases, PCP-1 and PCP-2; and p150, which represents the carboxy-terminal portion of ORF1a and includes the 3C-like proteinase. Intracellular immunofluorescence analysis revealed that this complex localizes to the perinuclear region, likely the endoplasmic reticulum or intermediate compartment (Fig. 5) . Replicase complex formation and ER localization has also been reported for the EAV replicase (Snijder et al., 1994; van Dinten et al., 1996) . Similarly, one MHV-A59 ORF1a product has been localized to the Golgi apparatus by immunofluorescent staining (Bi et al., 1995) . It is interesting to note that although EAV ORF1b products localize to membranes, the only hydrophobic, potentially membranespanning regions of gene 1 are found within ORF1a surrounding the viral 3C-like nsp4 protease domain (Snijder et al., 1994) . Additionally, EAV ORF1a proteins have been shown to coimmunoprecipitate with ORF1bspecific antisera (van Dinten et al., 1996) , suggesting strong protein\u00b1protein interactions between the cleaved gene 1 products in vivo.",

For MHV-A59 it has been shown that the hydrophobic domains flanking 3Cpro associate with membrane fractions of in vitro translation reactions (Pin \u00c4o \u00c2 n et al., 1997) . Even after proteolytic processing, these transmembrane domains may anchor 3Cpro and other ORF1a/ORF1b proteins to membranes by strong protein\u00b1protein interactions. The results of Pin \u00c4o \u00c2 n et al. (1997) demonstrated that addition of membranes to an in vitro transcription/translation reaction significantly increased the efficiency of 3Cpro cleavage from flanking hydrophobic regions. Similarly, we found that addition of canine microsomal membranes to in vitro transcription/translation reactions of an MHV-JHM 3Cpro precursor dramatically enhanced the efficiency of the processing events, generating a p27 (3Cpro catalytic core; Fig. 6 ). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that membrane association of 3Cpro in vivo is probably necessary for it to adopt a proteolytically efficient conformation and that the regions surrounding this domain are responsible for mediating its membrane association.",

Amplification conditions consisted of 35 cycles of: 94\u00b0C for 2 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 68\u00b0C for 1 min. Each PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes and ligated into the XbaI and HindIII sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX-KG (kindly provided by Dr. Steven Broyles, Indiana University). Following transformation of the ligation reaction into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha cells, ampicillin-resistant bacteria were induced for fusion protein production using the method of Guan and Dixon (1991) . Briefly, bacteria were grown at 30\u00b0C in 2\u03eb YT containing 50 g/ml ampicillin until cultures reached an OD 600 of 0.5\u00b10.55. Fusion proteins were then induced by the addition of IPTG, as optimized for each transformant: 50 M IPTG for 1 h (D5, D12, and D15), 50 M IPTG for 2 h (D10), or 100 M IPTG for 2 h (D3). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 g). The bacteria from 1 l of culture was resuspended in 100 ml PBS and lysed by sonication. Fusion proteins were isolated from the soluble fraction by affinity chromatography over glutathione\u00b1 sepharose bead columns as described by the manufacturer (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The fusion proteins were eluted by competition with 20 mM glutathione in 120 mM NaCl and 100 mM Tris\u00b1HCl, pH 8.0. The yield per liter of culture varied greatly, ranging from 400 g to 7 mg, depending on the apparent solubility of each fusion protein. Approximate yields of purified protein were as follows: D3, 7.0 mg/l; D5, 970 g/l; D10, 800 g/l; D12, 400 g/l, and D15, 2.5 mg/l. Rabbits were injected intramuscularly and subcutaneously with 1 ml of 200\u00b1500 g protein emulsified in 1 ml of Freund's adjuvant (complete adjuvant for first injection; incomplete for two or three subsequent in-jections, each approximately 30 days apart).

Mock-infected and MHV-JHM infected DBT cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine from 6.0 to 8.0 h p.i., lysed in buffer B as described under Materials and Methods, and the postnuclear supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the indicated immune sera, electrophoresed on 5\u00b115% gradient SDS\u00b1PAGE gels, and visualized by fluorography. U, uninfected cell lysates; I, infected cell lysates. Using this technique, proteins \u03fe300 kDa, p250, p210, and p150 are detected with all sera from infected cell lysates. In contrast, p40 is detected with anti-D3, anti-D5, and anti-D10 sera (lanes 2, 4, and 6), p65 is detected only with anti-D3 serum (lane 2), p27 is detected only with anti-D12 serum (lane 8), and p15 is detected only with anti-D15 serum (lane 10). Molecular mass markers are indicated on the left, and exposure lengths are indicated below each gel.FIG. 5. Detection of MHV-JHM ORF1a proteins by immunofluorescence. DBT cells were infected with MHV-JHM and processed for immunofluorescence at 5.5 h p.i. as described under Materials and Methods. Antisera D3 and D12 detected ORF1a gene products in discrete punctate sites in the perinuclear region of infected cells. Typical fields are shown at 400\u03eb and 1000\u03eb magnification.",
