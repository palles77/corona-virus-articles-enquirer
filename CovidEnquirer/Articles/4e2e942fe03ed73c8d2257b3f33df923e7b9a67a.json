Two groups of calves from conventional dairy farms were studied. The animals were examined 10 times during the first six weeks after introduction into a new environment. Haptoglobin, SAA and fibrinogen were analysed and weight gain, disease symptoms and treatments were recorded. Analysis of antibodies against viral infections was performed. An acute phase reaction (APR) score was established at each sampling by combining the APP results and total leukocyte counts. The health status differed between the two groups, although no manipulation of health had been performed, except that the group with a higher incidence of disease had a concurrent experimental infection with lungworm as part of another study. In the group with a higher incidence of disease, the mean weight gain was significantly lower, and the number of sampling days with elevated serum concentrations of APPs, and the mean maximum concentrations of haptoglobin and fibrinogen were significantly higher compared to the healthier group. The APR score was significantly higher at days 4 and 8 of the study in the group with a higher incidence of disease. The results indicate that measurement of APPs could be a useful tool for evaluation of health in calf herds.",

This production system comprises transportation of young calves from their birth farms to specialised units, and mixing of individuals from several different breeders. Stress due to transportation and mixing, in combination with exposure to a variety of microorganisms often leads to outbreaks of infection such as respiratory disease (Dyer, 1982) . Important microorganisms include bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine corona virus (BCV), bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3), bovine adenovirus (BAV), and certain bacteria, e.g., Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida (Ames, 1997; Bengtsson and Viring, 2000; Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 2001) .",

The tissue damage induces a cascade of events that leads to the production of acute phase proteins (APP) in the liver. Haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA) are important bovine APPs, which increase in serum for example during viral and bacterial diseases (Murata et al., 2004; Petersen et al., 2004) , but are absent, or present in very low levels, in healthy animals (Godson et al., 1996; Heegaard et al., 2000; G\u00e5nheim et al., 2003) . Moreover, sub-clinical inflammatory disorders can induce increase in APP concentrations (Karreman et al., 2000) . The concentration of fibrinogen, another APP, is increased in the plasma of animals with inflammatory disorders (McSherry et al., 1970) and has been used for many years to evaluate inflammatory disease in cattle (Eckersall and Conner, 1988) . Lungworm infection (G\u00e5nheim et al., 2004) , and stress due to poor housing (Alsemgeest et al., 1995) , weaning, transportation and mixing (Arthington et al., 2003) , can also result in increased APP concentrations in cattle.",

Analysis of serum haptoglobin and SAA was performed using the Tridelta Phase Range Haptoglobin Assay and SAA Assay (Tridelta Development Limited), respectively; the working range for the haptoglobin assay was 0.05-6 g/L, and the intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 5% at the concentration 1.3 g/L . The SAA assay had been slightly modified by adding extra standard points. The working range was 1.4-750 mg/L with samples diluted 1:500. In this range, the intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation were <10%. Serum antibody titres against bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine corona virus (BCV), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3), bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and bovine adenovirus type 3 (BAV-3) were analysed on three occasions per group, i.e. days 1, 18 and 39, using ELISAs (Svanova Biotech AB for BRSV, BCV, PIV-3 and BVDV, BIO-X Diagnostics for BAV-3) and all analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The results did not differ between groups indicating that an above normal leukocyte count alone is not a good indicator of disease. The significantly higher number of eosinophils in group B was probably due to the experimental inoculation with lungworm, as eosinophilia is a rather consistent finding during lungworm infection (Radostits, 2000) . This result was Table 2 Mean (SD) number of sampling days per calf with levels of serum haptoglobin, serum amyloid A (SAA) and plasma fibrinogen values above basal levels A in two groups (A and B) of calves sampled on ten occasions during the six week period after housing surprising as none of the animals had a patent infection with the presence of larvae in faeces. However, the eosinophilia indicates that the immune system of the calves had responded to the parasites. Thus, the lungworm infection may be one factor responsible for the elevated APP levels observed in group B, as lungworm infection can induce production of APP (G\u00e5nheim et al., 2004) . The seroconversion against BCV and BAV-3 in group B indicates that these infections were probably the main reason for the disease symptoms in this group. It is likely that some calves brought the infection from the farm of origin and spread it in the new group. The four calves that seroconverted against BCV reacted with increases in haptoglobin and fibrinogen and three of them also reacted with an increase in SAA. However, as indicated above, the lungworm infection may also have affected the clinical outcome; mixed infections are likely to result in more severe symptoms as was shown when combining viral and bacterial infections (G\u00e5nheim et al., 2003) . There may also have been other infectious agents circulating in the group, such as other serotypes of adenovirus or secondary bacterial infections, e.g., with M. haemolytica, or other opportunistic invaders, but other viral or bacteriological examinations were not performed in this study.",

In our study, differences in clinical health status between groups A and B, were consistent with the differences in the APR score. However, the results need to be interpreted with care, as the experimental infection with lungworm may have been partly responsible for the APP elevation.",

At present, routine use of APP analyses at the herd level is not realistic because of the high costs involved. However, pooling of serum from several animals in a herd may offer a way to minimize the costs. If less expensive analytical methods become available, the calculation of mean APR scores could be a useful tool for the evaluation of herd health. However, to provide the best evaluation of health status in a herd, or in a group of animals, frequent samplings during the whole rearing period should be made and again this is probably not a realistic approach as it would be too expensive. Sampling during the first weeks after arrival in the herd would give an indication of the pressure of infections and/or stress during transportation and mixing and so may not give a fair picture of the management conditions of the actual farm. In our opinion, samplings at, for example, monthly intervals during the middle and later stages of the rearing period may be more relevant if the main interest is to evaluate the animal health conditions of a specific farm. The establishment of suitable APP or APR score thresholds for herd health would require analysis of a much larger number of herds.",
