Nevertheless, at least 70% of patients with acute bronchitis and tracheitis in the United States receive antibacterial antibiotics after visiting a physician. Importantly, although the same bacteria that are commonly implicated in community-acquired pneumonia are also isolated from the sputum in half the patients, their role in the pathobiology of acute bronchitis and tracheitis or its attendant symptoms is unclear, and bronchial biopsies have not shown bacterial invasion.",

Such data indicating viral infection of the lower airways may help explain the relationship observed between rhinovirus infection and exacerbations of asthma (Chapter 87). Furthermore, pathologic islands of inflammation have been found in the trachea with rhinovirus infection, thus supporting the idea of a patchy distribution. The viruses implicated in acute bronchitis and tracheitis include influenza A and B (Chapter 372), parainfluenza (Chapter 371), respiratory syncytial virus (Chapter 370), coronavirus (Chapter 374), adenovirus (Chapter 373), and rhinoviruses (Chapter 369), usually in this order from the most to the least common. However, a recent French study of influenza-vaccinated adults found a viral cause in 37% of 164 cases of acute bronchitis, 21% of which were rhinovirus. Thus, at least three variables can influence the yield of specific pathogens: the presence of epidemics, the",

At the bedside, the absence of criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (Chapter 108) suggests bronchitis and tracheitis and makes a diagnosis of pneumonia (Chapter 97) unlikely. The SIRS criteria are met if the patient has more than two of the following: temperature lower than 36\u00b0 C or higher than 38\u00b0 C, pulse greater than 90 beats/minute, respiratory rate higher than 20 breaths/minute, or white blood cell count less than 4000 cells/mm 3 or higher than 12,000 cells/mm 3 or with greater than 10% bands.",

Cultures for M. pneumoniae are slow and insensitive. In general, testing for atypical organisms should not be done because of the cost of PCR and both the insensitivity and slowness of cultures.

Antibiotics may reduce symptoms by a fraction of a day, but side effects, the emergence of antibiotic resistance, and cost must be weighed against their modest benefits. The mean duration of an office visit for adults in the United States with upper respiratory tract infections is 14.2 minutes when patients are prescribed antibiotics versus 15.2 minutes without prescription of antibiotics, but antibiotic use is not an independent predictor of visit length.
