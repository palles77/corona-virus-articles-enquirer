We sought to determine the impact of routine screening for HIV in cancer patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) many of whom have not previously been tested. Given the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of hepatitis B and hepatitis C during cancer treatment, we implemented routine screening for these as well. Materials and methods: We implemented HIV, hepatitis B and C testing in the ED of a large tertiary cancer center with approximately 25,000 patients seen annually. Testing information was obtained using billing and laboratory databases. HIV testing was routinely implemented in July 2014, with hepatitis B and C testing added in May 2015. Testing results are described. Results: Testing rates improved considerably after the intervention. Between July 2014 and August 2015, 1.4% (0.4% newly diagnosed) of 852 patients screened positive for HIV. Between May and July of 2015, addition of hepatitis B and C screening demonstrated 7.2% (2.0% incident) and 3.3% (1.0% newly diagnosed) hepatitis B and hepatitis C seropositive rates, respectively. Conclusions: Routine HIV testing is feasible in a comprehensive cancer center ED. Seroprevalence of HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C viruses is comparable to other non-cancer center EDs. These results demonstrate the importance of testing for these viruses, with potential to cure one cancer-associated virus (hepatitis C) and reduce transmission of another cancer-associated virus (HIV). The long term goal of this project is to demonstrate feasibility and serve as a model for routine HIV screening among the cancer population at our center and in other cancer treating facilities.",

Its aim was to assess the impact of HIV infection on the hospital system in Cameroon. This study identified among others, the prevalence of HIV among patients visiting public and private health facilities as well as their behavior. Materials and methods: The study was conducted within 2015. It was a quantitative transversal study carried out through an administration of a questionnaire to 1500 patients visiting health facilities randomly selected in 6/10 regions of Cameroon. Data was entered on EpiData and analyzed with R.3.1.3. Results: Results from patients revealed an overall HIV prevalence of 7.4%, among patients visiting the health facilities, an HIV prevalence higher than the national prevalence. According to the study site, the eastern regions (10.4%), South (10.1%), Central (8.2%) and Yaound\u00e9 (10%) had higher prevalences, while the Littoral (3.9%), the North West (3.4%) and South West (3.2%) had lower prevalences. By sex, women were more infected with a prevalence of 8.37% against 5.72% in men. According to age, patients within the age group 25-35 years old represented 50% of HIV-positive patients, with an HIV prevalence of 9.9%. The risk of having an HIV-positive patient was twice in the age group 25-35 years, compared to the age group of 18-24 years, ). This risk was not significant when compared to that of patients within the age group 18-24 and to those aged 35 and older, OR=0.75 (0.44-1.2). Conclusions: The relatively high prevalence of HIV in patients relatively increases the risk of infection for health care staff. The health caregivers thus, represents group at risk group for which targeted interventions for the fight against HIV and AIDS and care should be taken. There is also need to generalized the HIV screening of all patients visiting health facilities.",

Wall, William Kilembe, Bellington Vwalika, Lisa Haddad, Naw Htee Kh, Ilene Brill, Cheswa Vwalika, Elwyn Chomba, Amanda Tichacek, Susan Allen Emory University, Atlanta, USA Introduction: 'Dual method use' (condoms for HIV prevention plus an effective modern contraceptive method for unintended pregnancy prevention) is a public health priority for heterosexual couples and has beneficial impacts on: 1) primary HIV prevention; 2) prevention of unintended pregnancy; and 3) prevention of mother-to-child transmission via unintended pregnancy prevention. However, rates of dual method use remain low. Improved understanding of factors predictive of such use are needed. Methods: Heterosexual Zambian couples (M+F-and M-F+) were enrolled into longitudinal, 3-monthly follow-up between 1994 and 2012. Couples were censored during pregnancy. The outcome of interest, time-varying dual method use, was defined as having no indication of unprotected sex (no self-reported unprotected sex, no sperm on a vaginal swab wet prep, no incident pregnancy, no incident trichomoniasis, and no incident HIV seroconversion) plus use of a modern contraception method (implant, injectables, intrauterine device, oral contraceptive pills, or a permanent method). Multivariable, repeated outcomes survival analysis models accommodating both fixed and time-varying covariates (Anderson-Gill models) explored factors associated with dual method use. Results: In 3,049 couples followed for an average of two years, dual method use was documented in 23-27% of all study intervals. In multivariable analyses, the factor most strongly associated with non-dual method use was the women being up to 6-months post-partum versus not pregnant (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR=0.5; 95%CI: 0.3-0.6), even when controlling for fertility intentions.",

Introduction: The biological products that use human raw materials in their production, have a high probability of transmission of infectious agents, among which are the viruses. The study of viral markers is one of the recommended safety measures for the control of lots of these products; question that though disputed by the unavailability of means of specific diagnoses, has been used in many countries. In Cuba, the LISIDA was appointed to the quality control lots of hemoderivatives and other biological, using algorithms work that include serological and molecular techniques for the study of viral markers to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) . The aim of this study was to show the results of using the algorithms used by the LISIDA for final approval of these products during 2015. Materials and methods: A total of 252 lots of products were studied: 110 of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), 71 human albumin 20%, 43 intermediates for the production of total and specific immunoglobulins (bulk), 11 final immunoglobulin product for intravenous and intramuscular use, 16 of dialyzed leukocyte extract of transfer factor and 1 of chorionic gonadotropin, following the methodology proposed in our laboratory for the detection of antibodies against HIV, HCV, HBV surface antigen and polymerase chain reaction for HIV and HCV. Results: All lots were approved except an API of hemoderivative and a bulk specific immunoglobulin to be reactive to HCV, as well as a lot of dialyzed leukocyte extract of transfer factor to be positive by PCR of hepatitis C.

LabyA1 also inhibits highly contagious airborne pathogens such as the orthomyxovirus strains of influenza virus A, e.g. H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, and influenza B strains and the pneumovirus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (EC50: 0.4 \u03bcM).",

This is the time to become aware of the risks involved in times of strong emotions. It is also to reach change in collective representations of negative behavior related to HIV transmission and not using condoms during casual sex. Example: 'whatever happens, effective treatments exists'. Materials and methods: Identify a dozen party locations in the city of Kribi. Obtain the agreement of operators to facilitate the work of volunteers; a trained coordinator and fifty volunteers, including ten supervisors will be mobilized to all sites. A mandatory two-day training for volunteers is essential. The main themes to address communication and the attitude and strategies to be adopted by the volunteers on the sites with different configurations to focus on prevention, the incentive to test screening, and stigma. The mission of the coordinator and supervisors will be to be placed between the DJ (Disc Jockey) and other presenters to encourage them to get messages during the evening and before the entry of the artists on stage; they will do this using slogans and messages that appear on leaflets and postcards produced by the structures of the struggles against AIDS; The trained volunteers will be tasked with inviting users to participate, addressing briefly the bulk of themes, and distributing materials (condoms, pamphlets\u2026), affixing posters in strategic locations. It will therefore issue a presence in these places of life to remind users simply the legitimacy of fun and having fun while preserving their health.

Conclusion: Based on the results, the number of new HIV infections in the under-5 age group can be significantly reduced in the rural settings in South Africa through effective implementation of PMTCT programs. Proper ANC management plays a crucial role in the prevention of HIV mother-to child transmission. Thus, it is important to encourage early ANC bookings, exclusive breastfeeding till the age of 6 months, as well as to improve the referral system and monitoring/ recording movement of patients amongst health institutions. Much attention should be paid to the ARVs initiation for HIV-positive mothers-to-be, testing of HIV-exposed babies, and encouraging the rapid re-testing these children at the age of 18 months.

Seven mothers with low social status and education, belonging to transmissive category IVDU (intravenous drug users) and two of them are prostitutes. All mothers are co-infected HIV/HCV, two of them are infected with a third viral infection -HBV. Two of the mothers has data for latent tuberculosis infection (positive Quantiferone test). Mothers have poor adherence to follow-up. Therefore, they failed to appear for starting of antiretroviral treatment during their pregnancies. Among our cases, two completed with maternal-fetal transmission (22%). Both pregnancies that end with vertical transmission of the infection, the mothers were in third stage of HIV-infection with severe immune suppression (CD4 <200/\u03bcl) and high viral load of HIV > 100 000 c/\u03bcl. In the all described group, 72% of the mothers are in the third stage of HIV-infection and 80% of infants born prematurely and have reduced weight gain. Since the monitored children were hospitalized to no more than third month after birth, we could not have explicit about their infection with HCV, because follow up was interrupted. Four of the children were with clinical manifestations of withdrawal symptoms due to drug addiction of the mother. In all children we observed moderate intrapartal asphyxia and retention to weight gain. From the laboratory studies in eight of the children, we established anemia. Five of the children were with thrombocytosis. This may be an indication of other infectious process. The values of platelets ranging from 534 to 871 G/l (average 655).

Material and methods: A retrospective study performed in an outpatient clinic receiving nearly a thousand HIV-infected people (40% HCV-co-infected). Patients diagnosed with HCC between 2002-2015 were selected. HIV viral load (VL), CD4 and CD8 cell counts and CD4:CD8 ratio during 24m preceding HCC diagnosis (baseline, BL) were collected. Patients' characteristics were described at BL. Results: 24 HCC pts (83% male; median age: 49y) were identified.

Findings: The mean duration of viral suppression (HIV RNA in plasma <50 copies/ml) was 9 years, and mean CD4 count of 688 cells per \u03bcL. We observed that smokers presented with a higher neutrophil CD64 surface expression than nonsmokers (P=0.05, Figure P39 .1). Moreover, there was a link between daily smoking rate (r=0.24, P=0.05) or cumulative tobacco consumption (r=0.24, P=0.05) and neutrophil surface CD64 density in current smokers. Discussion: Smoking is associated with higher numbers of circulating neutrophils compared to nonsmokers. Our data establish that, in addition to increased neutrophil peripheral count, tobacco smoking is correlated to increased CD64 membrane expression on neutrophils. The role played by neutrophils in various immune responses is more and more considered as essential.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Under the management of a MDT and rapid intervention to prevent severe complications, the twin pregnancy in an HIV positive liver transplant recipient had a favorable outcome with no evidence Introduction: The persistence of the hepatitis C and HIV epidemics, as well as the recurrent outbreaks of Dengue (DENV) and West Nile (WNV) fevers in Europe emphasize the importance of prompt countermeasures to reduce fatalities and limit the viral spread. Most available antivirals have a limited spectrum of efficacy. The development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents represents therefore an urgent need. Human DDX3 is an ATPase/RNA helicase involved in the replication of many viral pathogens. Targeting such a host factor may thus represent a strategy to develop broad-spectrum antivirals and to limit the emergence of viral resistance. Materials and methods: In silico drug design, chemical synthesis and enzymatic inhibitory assays were used to identify the most active leads. Infected-cell based assays were used to validate their antiviral activity. Results: We identified the first small-molecule non-nucleoside inhibitor of the RNA binding site of DDX3 helicase with broad spectrum antiviral activity (HIV-1 wild type, HIV drug-resistant strains, HCV, DENV and WNV). The good toxicity profile suggests that the DDX3 activity, while essential for viruses, could be dispensable to the cells, validating DDX3 as a pharmaceutical target. Conclusions: Our results suggest that DDX3 inhibitors can be exploited in order to treat HIV/HCV co-infections, emerging infectious diseases such as Dengue and West Nile and HIV-1 patients carrying drug resistant strains. Each of these three medical conditions currently represents a major challenge for clinical treatment. Results: Overall, the prevalence of TDR was 12.2%, being 6.1% to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 3.2% to non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTIs) and 2.9% to protease inhibitors (PIs). The thymidine associated mutations (TAMs) were the most prevalent TDR mutation found in RT gene, followed by K103N, T215 revertants and F77L. The M46I PI associated mutation was the more frequent, followed by V82A and L90M. The subtype B was the most prevalent (79.3%), followed by F1 (11.9%), BF recombinants (4%) and subtype C (2%).

One-third of men described selling ARVs to pill brokers/dealers who sold ARVs to HIV-negative MSM or who sold ARVs to MSM in combination with other drugs (e.g., methamphetamine). ARVs including the combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (the same ingredients used in PrEP) were more highly valued in the informal market than other ARVs Generally, participants described feeling good about providing ARVs to HIV-negative men, as they believed it could help those men from becoming HIV infected. Participants were included if they were employed within a local HIV or SU facility, had a relevant position title, and had a minimum of one year of relevant experience. IDIs were 45-90 minutes, followed a semistructured guide, and were facilitated by a licensed clinical psychologist. Data are being analyzed using thematic analysis in an iterative process. Formal analysis to confirm these preliminary findings are being conducted using NVivo 11. Results: The themes supported a differentiation and dissonance found in what the providers recognized as 'needs' to promote coordination of care versus how the care continuum operates. Study results identified where the breakdown in care coordination occurs throughout the treatment cascade among HIV-infected PWUD. The conceptual model presented identifies patient-, provider-, and system-level barriers and facilitators within the care coordination process. Conclusions: Results highlight challenges among HIV and SU providers in coordinating care for high-risk populations. Both types of providers (HIV and SU) lack an understanding of treatment modalities, communication processes, and providers' roles outside of their domain of expertise.

Conclusion: HIV-infected boys with both parents living are most likely to attend school, possibly due to a more stable family with more income, enabling preferred sons to attend school.

We studied the extent and mode of use of commercial sexual lubricants as potential behavioral facilitators for future use of a rectal microbicide. Method: MSM aged 18-30 years who reported condomless receptive anal intercourse (RAI) in the prior year were enrolled in Pittsburgh, PA; Boston, MA; and San Juan, PR, USA, between 12/2010-6/2012. They responded to a Computer Assisted Self Interview on lubricant use during RAI in the prior three months. Results: Participants were 228 MSM with mean 23 years of age. Fifty-eight percent used commercial sexual lubricants always and 37% sometimes. Among the 217 lubricant users, 87% used water-based lubricants; 36% used about two and 35% three teaspoons of lubricant applied around their anus (93%), on partners' penis (84%), and inside the rectum (60%) by both partners (79%) during sex (78%); 47% reapplied lubricant once and 30% twice during RAI. Participants obtained lubricants mainly from pharmacies (51%) and sex shops (25%). A transparent product with no flavor or scent was preferred; 38% preferred it somewhat liquid, 26% somewhat thick, and 26% neither. Asked about the ideal dispenser, 38% preferred a tube like toothpaste, 25% a pump, and 21% a container with pop-up lid; only 13% wanted a single use disposable tube. Conclusion: Although use of rectal lubricants was widespread and frequent among young MSM, use will need to be boosted for a rectal microbicide gel to be effective, as 42% reported using lube less than always. A transparent and flavorless product could have good acceptability, but at least two different viscosities appear necessary. There was very limited interest for lubricants delivered with disposable tubes (as is the case with microbicide gels under study). Lubricant application and reapplication is frequently carried out by both insertive and receptive partners, which may support microbicide use by either.",

Due to the fact that HIV infects mainly adults during their sexually active years and is inevitably fatal, its socioeconomic implications for development are immense. In this regard, three kinds of impacts can be distinguished. The first one is the loss of the income and household production of the family member, in particular if he/she is the breadwinner. The second impact is the increase in household expenditure to cover the medical costs. The third impact is the indirect cost resulting from the absenteeism of members of the family from school or work to take care of the patient. Methods: The study was a longitudinal survey among household with persons living with HIV and AIDS and other household from the general population. It involved three phases in five out of the six regions in TOGO. A total of 1170 households consisting of 863 case and 307 control households were interviewed. Results: PLWHA's recorded a mean body mass index of 24.3; that for their family was 23.6 and the control was 23.9. Difficulty in paying for school expenses for their wards was observed in 36.6% (75) case households as compared to 21.3% (13) in control households. Due the difficulty in paying for school expenses by households, children had to miss school because of the inadequacy of resources, 12.3% (25) of children from case households and 7% (5) Results: In total, 25 studies were selected. All studies are recent, being published between 2011 and 2015. There is a general trend among MSM who use meeting applications as a way to reach a rapid and free of prejudices' sexual satisfaction. These men are more likely to engage unprotected anal sex, chemsex and in a series of casual sex partners. There is a low testing prevalence in this population, contrasting with a high exposure.",

This study was undertaken with the aim of determining the seroprevalence of HIV, HBV, HCV, syphilis and socio-demographic risk factors associated with blood donation in a regional blood transfusion center in Togo. Methods: Sera samples were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to HCV, HIV types 1 and 2 and to Treponema pallidum using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays and rapid plasma reagin test respectively. All the relative samples for HIV, HBsAg and HCV were confirmed using a second enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Antibodies to Treponema pallidum were confirmed with a Treponema pallidum haemagglutination test (TPHA). Results: From the total of 4,615 blood donors in 2010, 1,452 (30.2%) were infected with at least one pathogen and 148 (3.35%) had serological evidence of multiple infections. The overall seroprevalence rate of HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis was 2,20%, 15,1%, 9,1% and 4%, respectively. Among blood donors with multiples infections, the most common dual or triple combination were HBsAg-HCV (1.40%), HBsAg-syphilis (0.67%) and HBsAg-HCV-syphilis (0.12%).The highest prevalences of HBsAg and HIV were found among blood donors from rural areas and in the age groups of 24-30 years and >40 years old, respectively. Conclusion: HBV and HCV remain the greatest threats to blood safety in Togo. Strict selection and retention of voluntary, non-remunerated low-risk blood donors are recommended to improve blood safety in the regional blood transfusion center of Lom\u00e9.",

Nurses were the preferred source of health related info, although village chiefs and religious leaders were also listed as trusted sources. Conclusions: While vaccination was shown to be desired by this population, education targeting both genders prior to future vaccination campaigns will be crucial since males were identified as primary decision makers. We expect that this program will increase HPV vaccine coverage and could be used as a model prior to the introduction of a HIV vaccine. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) had an outbreak in 2003. Even though SARS-CoV now remains in the natural bat reservoir, it still has the reemergence threat. Vaccination is a prophylactic strategy for this disease control and prevention. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a mechanism by which viruses such as, dengue virus, feline coronavirus, and HIV, as alternative strategies, apply to infect host cells to gain entry into the target cells by taking advantage of anti-viral humoral immune responses. The ADE effect of SARS-CoV infection is controversial. Materials: SARS-CoV TW1 strain (GenBank accession no., AY291451) was obtained from Taiwan CDC and SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus particles harboring the SARS-CoV S protein with HIV core structure virus were constructed for infectivity assay. The anti-SARS CoV infected patient's sera and generated monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against spike proteins were used for infectivity and neutralization assay. Immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy observation were performed to assay the viral susceptibility and ADE on HL-CZ cells with SASR-CoV infection in the presence of the different dilutions of anti-sera against SARS-CoV. Results: We found that SARS-CoV uses ADE to enhance its infectivity towards a human promonocyte cell line-HL-CZ. Quantitative-PCR and immunofluorescent staining indicated that SARS-CoV can replicate in HL-CZ and display virus-induced cytopathic effect as well as increased TNF-\u03b1, IL-4 and IL-6 two days postinfection. Results from flowcytometry indicate HL-CZ cells express angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a SARS-CoV receptors and higher level of FcrRII receptors.",

The convenience sampling included all the patients registered in the period from 2010 to 2012 in the Health Center of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto Medical School, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Brazil. The data were obtained from: a) medical files (medication, exams and visits); b) interviews with health professionals of the Tuberculosis Control Program (TCP) (physicians, nurses, nursing assistants); c) interviews with professionals who monitored the medication use in the patients' homes (drivers, sanitary visitors), including the resources used to make feasible the visit for the DOT (fuel). Results: Table P95 .1 shows the distributed costs for both treatment strategies -DOT and SMT. Patients in the DOT strategy resulted in an average cost of US$ 572.61, and those in the SMT strategy in US$ 360.26 since the beginning of the treatment and follow-up of the disease until the discharge. The rate of treatment interruption for the patients in DOT situation was very similar to the rate for patients in SMT situation, that is, 0.82 and 0.87, respectively. The estimated ratio between the costs and the end of treatment/cure was US$ 701.73 to treat one case in DOT strategy, and US$ 411.72 to treat one case in SMT strategy. Conclusion: Monitoring the intake of TB medication carried out at the patients' homes in DOT strategy generates high costs for the health system; however, whether this treatment strategy is cost-effective depends on additional studies of health technology assessment.

            "text": "Background: The persistence of integrated HIV DNA within reservoir cells contributes to our inability to achieve viral eradication in infected individuals. At the same time, drug resistance against dolutegravir (DTG)-containing first-line regimens has not yet been observed. We have hypothesized that this is attributable to the fact that the mutations that are selected by DTG at positions R263K and/or H51Y diminish viral replication capacity by as much as 80%. Treatment failure in treatment-experienced, integrase inhibitor-na\u00efve individuals treated with (DTG) is commonly associated with the R263K mutation and the resultant plasma viral loads are usually lower than observed with regimens that do not contain DTG. R263K confers low-level resistance against DTG and also decreases both viral replication capacity and viral integrase activity in short-term infectivity assays. Now, we sought to determine the effect of R263K and/or H51Y on integration over multiple rounds of infection. Methods: We measured HIV integration by Alu-mediated QPCR over 5 weeks of infection of Jurkat cells with WT, R263K and H51Y/R263K viruses. Levels of integration were measured weekly relative to WT virus. Results: The R263K/H51Y substitutions impaired the formation of newly integrated HIV DNA over multiple rounds of infection, beginning with impairments of about 30% in an initial round and declining to <10% when the progeny of the initial infection was used to initiate infection in subsequent rounds. Less impairment was noted if only R263K was present, consistent with the notion that selection of a second mutation at H51Y acts to further impair viral replication rather than acting as a compensatory mutation as is true for other drugs. Conclusions: Our study explains the absence of drug resistance to DTG in first-line therapy and raises the possibility that the presence of the R263KH51Y substitutions might result in fewer cells that contain integrated DNA and a smaller viral reservoir. Studies to confirm this hypothesis using clinical samples are in progress. \u226550% of the viruses tested. Improvement in neutralization breadth and potency was observed with time. At baseline Subtype-C specific neutralization predominated; interestingly follow up samples showed cross neutralizing activity. N332A dependence was absent while AIIMS_329 and AIIMS_330 showed N160K dependence, suggesting the presence of V1/V2 directed neutralizing antibodies. CD4bs specific antibodies were found in AIIMS_523 which improved with time. RSC3 depleted flow through of AIIMS_523 plasma exhibited >50%ID50 decrease in neutralization capacity against four pseudoviruses. Semen-originated anti-HIV specific antibodies (IgG and IgA) are able to cross a tight genital epithelium. This observation contrasts with the suggested role of anti-HIV IgA on the inhibition of viral transcytosis but confirms recent data reporting that anti-HIV-IgG may facilitate free-particles transcytosis and therefore enhance the risk of HIV contamination by sexual route.",

Despite the scarily situation, there is a disjointed programming to ensure HIV+ FSWs already on treatment are retained in care. John Snow Inc and Bantwana Initiatives Inc implemented Strengthening TB and HIV&AIDS responses in East Uganda (STAR-EC) project to increase access to, coverage of, and utilization of TB and HIV&AIDS services in the East central region. Key priority areas of the project were key population (FSWs) programming with focus to integrate innovative interventions to improve their retention in care and treatment. Materials and methods: STAR-EC/Bantwana initiatives supported HIV+ FSWs from 10 hotspots to form psychosocial support groups of 10-25 membership. Ten (10) groups were formed with a total of 170 FSWs. Groups selected their leaders/contact persons who were tasked to liaise with health workers (H/Ws) to ensure HIV services were provided. Two (2) members of each group were trained as peers/buddies to provide peer to peer support, condom distribution, maintaining a register of new recruits and those who move from one hot spot to another. Peers mobilized fellows for health services, monthly adherence meetings and liaised with H/Ws in cases of stock outs of condoms. They conducted follow up of FSWs who missed clinic appointments and tracked self transfers from one hotspot to another. Additionally, orientations of H/Ws on FSWs' friendly services were conducted. Health facilities identified specific days/or time of the day convenient for FSWs at each facility to access friendly services. Focal point persons at health facilities were identified to work hand in hand with the peers identified from the community. Results: For the time period July to December 2015, the program cumulatively tested 208 HIV+ FSWs, of whom 202 (97%) were linked on ART. Monthly follow ups were done and by end December 2015, 139 (69%) FSW had attended all the six months, 56 (28%) skipped a month of treatment, 5 transferred out, 1 died and only 1 was a lost to follow up patient. Meaningful involvement of FSWs as peers/buddies in health services delivery improves retention of HIV+ FSWs. Direct linkage of community service provider to H/Ws improves collaboration and better retention results for HIV positive clients. On the other hand, high illiteracy levels, stigma and the mobility nature of FSWs' work, make programming a bit more demanding. Conclusion: The model of involving HIV+ female sex workers as peers in the management of their health and health of their fellows can be adopted by health programs targeting key populations with minimal additional resources. Peer support programs even for key populations are vital to improve quality of life.Aim: Premature T cell senescence is observed in cART-naive HIVinfected patients. We evaluated the impact of cART on senescent CD8+ T cells in patients receiving a first-line cART. Materials and methods: A longitudinal substudy nested on the multicentric ANRS-EP45 Aging Study that investigates the cellular mechanisms leading to aging in HIV1-infected patients. Proportion of senescent CD28-, CD57+ and CD28-CD57+ CD8+ T cell subpopulations, total CD8+ and CD4+ cell counts and CD4:CD8 ratio were assessed by flow cytometry from cryopreserved PBMC at Baseline(BL) and after 12m(M12) follow-up. Variations(DeltaM12-BL) of these subpopulations were compared between BL/M12 and between patient groups. HIV-VL was measured by RT-PCR. Results: 28 naive pts (group A) and 59 pts receiving first-line cART (group B) had median age 41y and 45y, and HIV follow-up of 4.4y and 6.2y, respectively.

Both viruses elicit inefficient T cell response in the presence of CD4+FoxP3+ CD25hiT regulatory cells (Treg) with perturbed homeostatic function. Treg accelerate liver fibrosis, and CD39+Treg were associated with unfavorable prognosis in HBV and HIV infection. We evaluated the impact of HCV co-infection on the differentiation of Treg in HIV+ patients with virologic response to cART. Patients and methods: Blood samples from HIV+ (n=22,A) and HCV+HIV+ (n=22,B) patients were studied before and 6 months after the start of cART.

It was combined with differentiation of con CD4 T (RA+R7/RA-R7-ratio 8.9 vs 2.3 at baseline; P<0.05), and domination of effector (RA-Foxp3hi) over resting (RA+FoxP3lo) Treg, (48% vs 15% P<0.01). Gr.A Treg were mainly of non-suppressive (RA-FoxP3lo/neg) phenotype (47% vs 29% eTreg, 24% nTreg, P<0.05). Gr.B was also distinguished by important share of CD39+Treg (42% vs 15% for A; P<0.05), and increase of exhausted CD39+ Tcon (9.2 vs 3.9 for A, P<0.05). Conclusions: In HIV/HCV co-infection, successful cART restores anti-HCV T-cell response together with induction and differentiation of potent Treg. Thus, the additional immune activation mediated by HCV may enhance the exhaustion of viral-specific T cells while increasing the risk of liver damage. Our results underline the importance of simultaneous HIV-and HCV-specific treatment for the co-infected.Influence of microbial translocation and inflammation on CD8 T-cell elevation in primary HIV-1 infectionIntroduction: CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic immune activation are the hallmark of HIV infection. Recently CD8 T cell elevation has been independently linked with non-AIDS events in chronically infected patients treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). We have previously shown the contribution of early initiation of ART in reduction in CD8 T cell counts. Here, we assessed the association of microbial translocation and inflammatory cytokines with CD8 T cell elevation in the primary HIV-infected patients.",

Materials and methods: This retrospective study took place from 2014 to 2015. A systematic pharyngeal, rectal and urine CT infection with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) was proposed once a year to every asymptomatic MSM received. Only the ones who have been tested on the three localizations were selected, that meant 1545 persons. The bacterial strain rectal identification concerning CT infection was done in the CNR of Bordeaux. Besides, every participant underwent both blood test for HIV and screening for STIs and syphilis. Results: Within the 1545 patients selected, 180 were CT infected on at least a localization, that is to say 11,65 %. Prevalence of CT was 9,19 % in rectal, 1,87 % in pharyngeal and 2,39 % in urines. Within the 142 patients presenting a rectal localization CT, a typage found 11 L strains. On the 180 CT positives patients, 42 of them presented at least an associated STI, that's to say 22,77 %. Most often, it was Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection (12,77 %), syphilis (8,33 %) or HIV positivity (4,44 %). Discussion: The isolated urinary screening, much more rarely positive, appeared insufficient. The rectal localization portage is the most frequent. The typage found an asymptomatic L strain on 11 patients which arises the issue of the lack of clinical signs for this infection that is subject to a strong epidemic rebound. The frequency of an associated STI confirmed the importance of a complete screening. Conclusion: These results could encourage to evaluate a systematic CT and NG screening towards the asymptomatics MSM, and to adapt the French regulation.Development of community-led education interventions for human papillomavirus vaccination as a model for future HIV vaccination campaigns cancer (CC) as well as willingness to be vaccinated for HPV in Bamako, Mali. By developing and testing a model for community-led education, GAIA hypothesizes that both the HPV and future HIV vaccine will have higher completion rates and coverage. Materials and methods: Beginning in April 2015, GAIA launched a 6-month campaign using a West African-style printed cloth to illustrate the connection between HPV and CC during education sessions in 4 neighborhoods and 5 clinics. Radio programs were broadcast throughout the city. A questionnaire was proposed to 317 women seeking CC screening at any of the 5 clinics to determine effectiveness of each communication method on knowledge about HPV and CC, as well as willingness to include adolescents in an HPV vaccination program. Results: Only 13% of the 317 women who responded to the questionnaire knew what HPV was, but 70% had heard of CC. 86% wanted the vaccine to be available in Mali, and 84% wanted their child vaccinated, although 45% said they would call their husbands to gain consent. 42%",

Reasons for women coming for cervical cancer screeningeffects to build upon our understanding of the epidemiology and overall the medical importance of arboviruses. Materials and methods: A multiplex one-step real-time PCR discriminatory for Zika and Chikungunya, with an internal control (IC), was standardized with virus culture. To assess the performance of our assay, it was challenged with clinical samples. From Oct/2015 to Jan/2016, plasma were collected from clinical suspected patients. The RNA was extracted with MDx equipment (QIAGEN), the one-step real-time PCR set up was performed automatically with Janus instrument (PerkinElmer) and the amplification was carried on the sequence detection system QuantStudio (Life Technologies). Results: The assay was adjusted for satisfactory performance, reproducibility, specificity and high sensibility. The IC successfully control all steps and reaction. The threshold line was fixed on 0.3. Eight replicates of ten-fold serial dilution (10-10 6 ) of Zika and Chikungunya culture virus were analyzed and showed 100% of detection. A total of 43 samples from patients suspected of Zika and 228 of Chikungunya were analyzed. Our assay detected 11 patients positive to Zika and 63 to Chikungunya. Laboratory diagnosis of Zika is challenging, viral RNA can be detected in serum only during the first days of the illness. Conclusions: Molecular techniques offer high sensitivity and specificity, and rapid availability of information. The approach of screening by real-time PCR is well suited for use in a clinical laboratory and can be easily adapted for high throughput screening. The rapid implementation of this Zika/Chikungunya multiplex NAT assay in Brazil will help identify endemic regions and the management of patients.SARS coronavirus has antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect through the autologous antibodies against envelope spikes on Fc\u03b3 receptor expressing cells Chun-Sheng Yeh 1,2 , Jyh-Yuan Yang 4 , Wu-Tse Liu 5 , Jason C.

A severe dengue fever (DF) outbreak reported in Taiwan in 2014. Notably, an accident underground pipeline explosion was occurred in the midnight of 1st August and subsequently accompanied with continuous rain. We hypothesized that underground explosion is an important factor to trigger this outbreak. Materials and methods: We collaborated with Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital system to collect 4,400 serum samples from DF patients. The virus isolation was conducted using C6/36 insect cells. RT-PCR and phylogenetic analyses using NS1 and Env gene for serotyping and genotyping respectively. The information of the DF and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) was collected from Taiwan CDC. The data of precipitation, temperature changes and consecutive raining days in Kaohsiung were offered by Taiwan Central Weather Bureau. Results: The data indicate that there were 15,732 reported cases of DF in 2014, including 15,492 indigenous cases and 240 imported cases. The mass of DF cases were reported in Kaohsiung City (15,043 cases; 95.6%). Results showed that after gas explosion, the percentage of Breatou index (BI) to be above 5-9% (level II) for the measure of mosquito density increasing from 36% to 48% and the DF cases also increased dramatically in 1-2 months after the gas explosion. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that all the outbreak-associated dengue viruses were belonged to serotype 1 and subgenotype E4. Climate changes have a significant impact on the transmission and incidence of DF. We found rainfall and higher temperature significantly correlate with 2014 dengue outbreak (Spearman correlation analysis; P<0.0001; r=0.87 and 0.78, respectively). Results also indicate that earlier trends of imported DF occurrences significantly caused the later indigenous epidemics or outbreaks during 2005-2014 (Spearman correlation analysis; P<0.0001). We found that the most dengue epidemics in Taiwan sourced from our neighboring countries. Conclusions: We conclude that three main factors that may have been associated with this DF outbreak in Kaohsiung: an underground pipeline explosion combined with subsequent rainfall and higher temperature. These factors may have enhanced mosquito breeding activity, facilitating DENV transmission.Identification of Dengue and Chikungunya viruses among suspected cases of Yellow fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo that can induce the same symptoms in patients enrolled in the yellow fever surveillance in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Materials and methods: Of 652 patients included in the surveillance of yellow fever in DRC from January 2010 to January 2012, 498 were selected for the study. Real time PCR was performed for the detection of dengue, West Nile, Chikungunya, O'Nyong Nyong, Rift Valley fever, Zika and yellow fever viruses. Results: The average age of patients was 24 years. Sixteen cases of dengue (serotypes 1 and 2) and two cases of Chikungunya were found. Tree cases of dengue were found in early July 2010 from Titule (Province Orientale) during the laboratory-confirmed outbreak of yellow fever, suggesting probably a simultaneous circulation of dengue and yellow fever viruses. Conclusion: These findings call medical staff and health authorities for vigilance. A prospective study is needed to establish the epidemiology of these diseases in the DRC.Investigation into an outbreak of Dengue-like illness in Pernambuco, Brazil revealed a co-circulation of Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue virus type 1Rodrigo Pess\u00f4a, Jo\u00e3o Veras Patriota, Maria De Lourdes De Souza, Alvina Clara Felix, Nubia Mamede, Sabri S.

            "text": "Aims: Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonosis with a worldwide distribution, more commonly found in developing countries and tropical regions. The global burden of leptospirosis is estimated to be 873,000 severe annual cases and 49,000 deaths. This neglected disease is expected to become an increasingly important health problem due to predicted global climate changes. A part of cases are currently under detected due to similar clinical presentation than other febrile illnesses. There is a need for an accurate and rapid diagnostic test that could detect precociously for increased antibiotic treatment efficacy. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a new generic commercial PCR kit, based on the protocol from the in-house test of the French reference center (CNR), for human leptospirosis diagnostic and monitoring. Materials and methods: DNA was extracted from 0.25 mL of plasma and eluted in 60 \u03bcL RNase-free buffer using QIAamp DNA mini Kit (Qiagen). Then, 5 \u03bcl of the leptospirosis DNA were added to the 15 \u03bcL of the reaction mix. Clinical validation was done on 35 selected blinded samples comparatively with the CNR method. A panel of leptospirosis DNA standard, positive and negative control as well as an internal extraction control were provided in the kit. Results: This assay was specific and showed linearity over a wide range from 1 to 106 l/\u03bcL. The 95% detection limit was 0.5 l/\u03bcL. Intra-assay variability ranged from 0.57 to 1.11%, whereas the inter-assay variability ranged from 0.31 to 0.51%. The kit is able to detect and quantify all pathogenic strains provided and showed similar bacteremia quantitation with the CNR reference test (Figure P91.1) . Conclusions: The kit derived from the French reference method is one of the first validated, standardized and easy-to-use real-time PCR kit for human leptospirosis diagnostic compatible with pathogenic strains detection and large distribution worldwide.",

Introduction: Information on the diversity and evolution of nonhuman primate retroviruses is limited by incomplete geographic sampling, particularly from India. Unlike the African primates, Indian Old World Monkeys are not known to be naturally infected by SIVs. This is based on negative results of sero-surveillance of primate plasma samples performed during early days of the AIDS pandemic, although rhesus macaques experimentally infected by SIVmac (variant of the African SIVsm) are used as primate models for HIV/AIDS. The aim of the investigation (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) was to explore evidence for lentiviral infection of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) from the Rajasthan forests, infected by novel Type D Simian Retroviruses (SRV) and Simian Foamy Viruses (SFV). Materials and methods: In the absence of commercial tests for SIV, plasma samples of the feral simian species were screened by HIV-1 WB, that identified antibody reactivity in a proportion of samples. Crucially, reactivity was observed with monoclonal antibody against HIV-1 p24 antigen, but not SIVmac p27antigen. Purified lentiviruses ",
