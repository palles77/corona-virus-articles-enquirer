We probed these membranes with four pairs of acute and convalescent sera from recovered SARS cases. We correlated positively reacting peptides with the in vitro SARS-CoV neutralizing activity of the samples. We found that convalescent sera with high neutralizing activity recognized exclusively only a limited number of peptides on the membranes. This suggests that antibodies against the epitopes represented by these peptides could be responsible for much of the SARS-CoV neutralizing activity. The findings have implications for monitoring humoral responses to SARS-CoV as well as for developing a successful SARS vaccine.",

            "text": "Shown in Table 2 are the 24 overlapping membrane peptides that were recognized exclusively, or much more strongly, in multiple pairs of convalescent compared with the respective acute sera. None of these peptides was recognized by the serum from the deceased case or the healthy control. There were two overlapping sequences from Orf 1a, one from Orf 1b, six from N-protein, eleven from S-protein, two from M-protein, one from E protein and one from Orf 10. The remaining open reading frames were not reactive in more than one serum sample. In the table, those peptides listed with a sequence of 14 amino acids were identified as a combination of three adjacent spots on the membranes, whereas those listed with 12 were identified as a combination of two adjacent spots. Common sequences therefore include residues 5 -10 of the 14-amino-acid peptides and 3-10 of the 12-aminoacid peptides. The note to the right of M4P1 shows the key to the Orfs with peptide totals in brackets. This membrane was spotted with dye instead of amino acids. In actual membranes, each spot is a 10-amino-acid peptide with adjacent spots being shifted by two amino acids. Characterization of the immune response against these single case epitopes promises to provide important insights into their role in the resolution of infection. However, epitopes recognized by multiple convalescent sera may be the most important targets of neutralizing antibodies. (b -d) Examples of membrane panels probed with various serum samples and developed with peroxidase-labeled goat antihuman IgA; (b) M1P2 probed with control serum, acute as well as convalescent serum from case 2, convalescent serum from case 1, and serum from the deceased case. Notice the triad of spots recognized only in the serum of the two convalescent cases. The peptide sequences from Orf 1a are SDDYIKLNGP, DYIKLNGPLT, and IKLNGPLTVG. (c) P3M2 probed with acute and chronic serum from case 2 and serum from the deceased case. Panel 3 has peptides from S-protein. Notice the triad of spots recognized only by the convalescent serum. The peptide sequences from S-protein are FQPFQQFGRD, PFQQFGRDVS, and QQFGRDVSDF. (d) P4M3 probed with acute and convalescent serum from case 2 and convalescent serum from case 1. Notice the triad of spots recognized in the two convalescent sera. The peptide sequences from N-protein are QLPQGTTLPK, PQGTTLPKGF, and GTTLPKGFYA. Additional peptides to those shown in Table 2 were recognized only by convalescent serum from one of the four cases. Among these single case examples were peptides from Orf 3, Orf 4, Orf 9, Orf 13, and Orf 14, indicating that the virus expresses these proteins and that antibodies against certain of their epitopes are being produced. Characterization of the immune response against these single case epitopes promises to provide important insights into their role in the resolution of infection. However, epitopes recognized by multiple convalescent sera may be the most important for developing antibodies that will protect against the virus.",

            "text": "Our knowledge of the functions of the SARS-CoV proteins is mostly derived from analogies with those of other well-characterized corona viruses. Over 21 kb of the total genome is taken up by Orf 1a and Orf 1b, which are presumed to encode for proteins such as proteases and polymerases that are associated with virus replication (Marra et al., 2003; Ruan et al., 2003) . The genome is sufficiently unique to be proposed as belonging to a separate group designated as Group IV (Marra et al., 2003; Ruan et al., 2003) , but this view is not consensual and it has been noted that SARS-CoV is most closely related to group 2 coronaviruses (Snijder et al., 2003) . Nevertheless, the structural proteins S, M, N, and E have been clearly identified in virus grown in infected cells (Marra et al., 2003; Ruan et al., 2003) . The spike, or S-protein, protrudes from the outer surface and is a strong candidate for facilitating viral entry into host cells. Li et al. (2003) have reported that the SARS-CoV Sprotein efficiently binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 of SARS-CoV permissive Vero E6 cells, suggesting that this binding is a key step in SARS-CoV infectivity. Interaction between the S-protein of a corona virus and specific mammalian receptors can determine species sensitivity. For example, when the S-protein ectodomain of mouse corona hepatitis virus was replaced with that of the feline infectious peritonitis virus, the viral particles were no longer infective for mouse cells, but became infective for feline cells (Kuo et al., 2000) . SARS-CoV has been reported to infect domestic cats and ferrets (Martina et al., 2003) so these relationships may have relevance to this broader species susceptibility. A further example of interaction between the S-protein and mammalian receptors involves CD13 or aminopeptidase N. It is the main mammalian receptor for the S-protein of many coronaviruses. Substitution on human cells of the human CD13 N-glycosylation site with the porcine N-glycosylation site resulted in a failure to bind human corona virus-229E (Wentworth and Holmes, 2001) .",

One possibility is to use a combination of peptides, such as those listed in Table 2 , as a Sequences with 14 amino acids represent three adjacent peptides with a common sequence from residues 5 to 10. Sequences with 12 amino acids represent two adjacent peptides with a common sequence from residues 3 to 10. The amino acid positions (aa) in SARS-CoV open reading frames are taken from BLAST at NCBI: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi. polyvalent antigen. Peptide-based vaccines have heretofore had only limited success but this can be attributed to a lack of knowledge as to which peptides to use. Such uncertainty is reduced by analyzing the antibody pattern in sera from cases that have successfully resolved the infection. Peptides making up the antigen can be screened in advance for homologies to mammalian proteins, reducing the possibility of self-attack. They can also be easily modified to cope with viral mutations that could escape traditional vaccines. Significant mutations have already been identified in SARS-CoV (Ruan et al., 2003; Martina et al., 2003) , indicating the necessity of developing adaptable vaccines.",

The software used for designing the arrays was from DIGEN, Jerini Biotools GmbH, Berlin, Germany. Membranes derivatized with a polyethylene (PEG) linker and a free amino terminal, as well as 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (fmoc) amino acids were obtained from Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments. The fmoc amino acids (0.25 M) were dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma, Oakville, Ont. Canada) and then activated with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT, Sigma) and N, N V -disopropylcarbodiimide (DIPC, Sigma) for at least 15 min. They were then delivered to the membrane in 60-nl aliquots per spot by the robotic synthesizer. Fifteen minutes after completion of each cycle, the membranes were removed from the apparatus and treated with 2% acetic anhydride in DMF to acetylate any free remaining amino groups. They were then washed and further treated with 20% piperidine in DMF to remove the fmoc protecting group. This was followed by washing with DMF and methanol, and finally by air drying. The membrane was then precisely repositioned on the robotic apparatus to initiate the next coupling cycle. After the final cycle, the side chain protecting groups were removed by treatment with a solution of the following composition: 5 ml of 50% trifluoracetic acid; 5 ml dichloromethane (DCM); 300 Al triisopropyl silane (Sigma); and 200 Al water. Membranes were then washed twice with DCM, twice with DMF, and twice with methanol. After air drying, membranes were stored in a sealed bag at 4 jC until used.",

After washing three times with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated at 37 jC for 1 h with 1/100 dilutions of serum samples of patients and controls. After washing, membranes were treated with 1/5000 dilutions (0.2 Ag/ml) of goat antihuman IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). After washing in TBS-T, membranes were developed with an ECL chemiluminescence kit provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, England). Four milliliters of the two ECL Western blotting detection reagents were mixed before being applied on the membranes. The membranes were scanned using a Bio-Rad Fluorescent Imager (Hercules, CA) and saved for later analysis. The membranes were regenerated by incubation in 8 M urea/1% SDS overnight followed by 60 min in 50% ethanol/10% acetic acid.
