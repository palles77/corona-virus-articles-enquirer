            "text": "To obtain a more sensitive and convenient diagnosis of the disease, we prepared monoclonal antibodies specific for the FeLV p27 to develop a rapid diagnostic test with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Among these antibodies, we identified two clones (hybridomas 8F8B5 and 8G7D1) that specifically bound to FeLV and were very suitable for a diagnostic kit. The affinity constants for 8F8B5 and 8G7D1 were 0.35 \u00d7 10 9 and 0.86 \u00d7 10 9 , respectively. To investigate the diagnostic abilities of the rapid kit using these antibodies, we performed several clinical studies. Assessment of analytical sensitivity revealed that the detection threshold of the rapid diagnostic test was 2 ng/mL for recombinant p27 and 12.5 \u00d7 10 4 IU/mL for FeLV. When evaluating 252 cat sera samples, the kit was found to have a kappa value of 0.88 compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), indicating a significant correlation between data from the rapid diagnostic test and PCR. Sensitivity and specificity of the kit were 95.2% (20/21) and 98.5% (257/261), respectively. Our results demonstrated that the rapid diagnostic test would be a suitable diagnostic tool for the rapid detection of FeLV infection in cats.",

            "text": "Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is one of the most important infectious pathogens that causes death in cats and is broadly spread worldwide [12, 17, 24] . FeLV was discovered among cats that lived in a cluster-household where several animals had developed lymphosarcoma [19] . The virus is an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA retrovirus. Cats are usually infected by direct contact with infected cats [12, 31, 33] , mostly via oronasal exposure to saliva and nasal secretions containing high levels of the virus especially through mutual grooming and sharing food dishes or water bowls [11, 12, 17] . Vertical transmission occasionally occurs [35] but is of secondary importance. FeLV-associated diseases include a variety of neoplastic disorders, anemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, neurological disorders, reproductive failure in female cats, and numerous secondary infections caused by FeLV-induced immunosuppression [12, 34] . Although the period of disease progression is highly variable, 83% of FeLV-infected cats die within 3 years [29] . Given these findings, the accurate diagnosis of FeLV infection is very important to break the cycle of horizontal and vertical transmission in feline populations. Several diagnostic tools have been introduced in veterinary clinics: the passive hemagglutination test [37] , complement fixation test [36] , immunofluorescent assay [13] , enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [25] [26] [27] [28] , saliva test [10] , and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) [7] . The RDT, also 92 Won-Shik Kim et al. known as the lateral flow rapid test, has several advantages such as quick turnaround, cost-effectiveness, and usability in locations far removed from laboratories. Consequently, the RDT has been widely used in clinics and elsewhere [30, 39] . In this report, we describe the preparation of monoclonal antibodies specific for the p27 of FeLV. We also provide details about the development of an RDT system using these antibodies and clinical characteristics of the assay. ",

The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) at 37 o C in 5% CO 2 . Before infection with the virus, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and inoculated with the viruses for 6 h in DMEM containing 5% FBS at 37 o C in 5% CO 2 . After 4 days, the culture media was changed and the infection progressed until 80\u223c90% of the cells were floating or lightly attached to the T-75 flask (typically 10 days post-infection) (Thermo Scientific, USA). The viruses were harvested and purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation (3% sucrose) as previously described [32] .",

Immunizations were carried out at 2-week intervals by injecting the mice with 0.5 mL (50 \u03bcg) of rec. p27.

Isotyping of the cloned mAbs was carried out using goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich).

Certain parameters such as steric hindrance may have affected antigen-antibody binding. According to a previous report [28] , the mean concentration of FeLV p27 in infected feline serum from a cat suffering from persistent viremia was 4,800 ng/mL (600\u223c15,000 ng/mL) and 3,600 ng/mL (300\u223c28,000 ng/mL) in serum from a feline with transient viremia. Therefore, the RDT using 8F8B5 and 8G7D1 which had a detection limit of 2 ng/mL for rec. p27 and 12.5 \u00d7 10 4 IU/mL for the virus would be very useful for practical diagnosis. According to other previous reports [14, 15] , the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of current commercialized diagnostic kits including enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) range from 92.0\u223c94.7% and 97.5 \u223c99.8%, respectively. The RDT system is typically believed to be less sensitive than an EIA because RDT does not include a washing step and various blocking reagents are used to prevent non-specific reactions. The RDT kit developed in the present study was found to possess excellent diagnostic properties (a sensitivity of 95.2% and specificity of 98.5%). Compared to the BioNote Rapid FeLV/FIV Combo Kit (cat. no: RC12-04, lot no: 1204172; Alere BioNote, Korea), the RDT we developed showed a lower level of analytical sensitivity (data not shown). Using 12 FeLV-positive specimens, both RDTs identified all samples as positive but the band signal of the RDT we produced was stronger than that of the commercial RDT (data not shown). We speculate that the high accuracy of our RDT was due to the properties of the monoclonal antibodies (8F8B5 and 8G7D1) with high affinity constants that we generated.",

A POCT for FeLV infection is important because it would facilitate field-testing of cats, especially stray animals, by veterinarians. In our study, none of the 155 household cats were FeLV-positive while 21 out of 127 stray cats produced positive results. To prevent the spread of FeLV infection among cat populations, stray animals should be rapidly diagnosed and treated. The RDT developed in our study could be used as a promising POCT tool for diagnosing FeLV infection in conjunction with other conventional antigen tests such as ELISAs [25] [26] [27] [28] and nucleic acid testing [1] [2] [3] .",
