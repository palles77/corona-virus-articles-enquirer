            "text": "Background: The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza emerged in April 2009 and spread rapidly and broadly all over the world. In addition to specific antiviral agents, massive vaccination is thought to be the most effective way of controlling the transmission. To understand the prevaccination status of certain risk groups, this study compared the baseline seroprevalence of antibodies to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus among hospital staff with different contact risks and that of the general population. Methods: A total of 295 serum samples from hospital staff and 244 control serum samples from people who came for physical check-up (control group) were collected between October 2009 and November 2009 before the massive vaccination campaign. The hospital staff was divided into first-line risk personnel (group 1) and second-line risk personnel (group 2) according to their potential contact risks. Hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests were conducted to determine the individual serological status. The seropositive rate (SPR, defined as the proportion with HI titer \u2265 1:40) of antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus and its geometric mean titer (GMT) were calculated and compared among the different groups. Results: The mean ages and sex ratio (% male) of the hospital staff and control groups were 36.9 \u00b1 10.6 years and 52.0 \u00b1 12.6 years, and 24.4% and 57.6%, respectively. The SPR of the antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus of the hospital staff was significantly higher than that of the control group (20.0% vs. 2.9%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the SPR antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus of group 1 were significantly higher than that of group 2 (30.8% vs. 12.6%, p < 0.001). However, the GMT of antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus of the hospital staff was not significantly different from that of the control group (p = 0.925). Conclusion: The SPR of antibodies against the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in the hospital staff was higher than that in the general population, reflecting a higher contact risk. Prevaccination surveillance of the immune status of different risk groups may help to prioritize which groups should be vaccinated first. [J Chin Med Assoc 2010;73(2):62-66] ",

Then, 600 \u03bcL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was mixed with RDE-treated serum to generate a 10-fold diluted solution. Next, 50 \u03bcL of packed guinea pig red blood cells (GP-RBC) were added to the solution for 1-2 hours at 4\u00b0C to remove nonspecific hemagglutination activity. The GP-RBC suspension was prepared as follows: approximately 10 mL of guinea pig blood was obtained and thoroughly mixed with a 1:4 ratio of Alsever's solution (anticoagulant). The GP-RBC suspension was filtrated through sterile 2-layered gauze and washed with PBS (pH 7.2) 3 times and then diluted with PBS to form a 10% RBC stock suspension.

The WHO issued a pandemic alarm in June 2009; this pandemic involved 200 more countries, with more than 1 million confirmed cases and 10,000 reported deaths. 1, 11 Initially, the case mortality rate was thought to be high (approximately 7% in Mexico), but it now appears that the mortality rate is no more than that of seasonal influenza. 12 The case mortality rate estimated by the Taiwan Center for Disease Control is approximately 1 in 10,000. 8 The decline in the case mortality rate of the novel H1N1 pandemic is not likely to be due to rapid virus evolution as genetic analyses have not shown significant mutations. 5, 6 Instead, stringent surveillance for infected people may be identifying a greater number of mild cases. The same phenomenon has been described in another swine-origin influenza outbreak in 1976 in Fort Dix, 13, 14 where 230 positive cases were diagnosed by serological survey but there were only 13 cases with clinical symptoms and 1 death. Our results are consistent with the notion that by serological surveillance, seropositive individuals can be identified from certain risk groups, such as hospital staff.",

            "text": "Although there are specific antiviral agents available for treatment, it is generally believed that the most effective approach is through a vaccination campaign. 15 Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of vaccination to prevent mortality and hospitalization, and recent studies have indicated that the 2009 H1N1 monovalent vaccine is immunogenic in both adults and children. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] The adverse effects associated with vaccination are mild to moderate. 17, 18, 21 Before initiating a massive vaccination campaign, it is imperative to understand the seroepidemiology of the population. Traditionally, the HI test is a standard to evaluate the antibody response to influenza vaccination. Since the novel H1N1 influenza virus has never circulated among people and previous seasonal vaccination offers limited cross-protection, the SPR should, theoretically, be low even after seasonal vaccination. 22, 23 However, there are certain risk groups that may contract the disease. Myers et al found that swine workers are at increased risk of being infected by swine-origin influenza virus through close contact. 24 Healthcare workers are susceptible to infectious diseases and our Seroprevalence of antibodies to H1N1 virus in hospital staff results support that notion. Hospital-acquired outbreaks were reported during the SARS epidemic. 9, 25, 26 For the mild pandemic (H1N1) 2009, our hospital issued guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment, such as the wearing of surgical or higherlevel masks, gloves, and facial protection equipment. A self-reporting system was also established to identify symptomatic individuals according to the clinical definition set by the Taiwan Center for Disease Control, i.e. (1) fever > 38\u00b0C; (2) influenza-like symptoms, such as cough, headache, general malaise etc.; (3) exclusion of illnesses with definite diagnoses, such as tonsillitis. In this study, the strikingly high SPR among the hospital staff, especially first-line workers, indicates that the symptoms were mostly mild or subclinical. The lack of significant differences in GMTs was not unexpected as the 2 groups had not yet been vaccinated and their immune statuses were presumably similar. However, the relatively low GMT levels indicate that the exposed individuals with mild or vague symptoms did not develop strong immune responses, compared to vaccination which usually elicits a strong immune response. Most of the recent studies on the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus focused on the clinical manifestations of symptomatic cases. 6, 27 However, the scope of this pandemic may be even more extensive, as admitted cases are likely to be the tip of the iceberg. Most infected individuals, as our data show, probably only have mild or even subclinical symptoms.",

In addition, for prevaccination surveillance, healthcare workers may serve as a target group in whom early seroepidemiologic changes of new emerging infectious diseases may be detected, and vaccine efficacy evaluated. Furthermore, for those who have already developed protective antibodies against the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, whether or not a booster dose of vaccination is needed is debatable. Given that a relatively high proportion of certain groups may have already developed protective antibodies and given the mild nature of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, the pros and cons of a massive vaccination campaign deserve further investigation.",
