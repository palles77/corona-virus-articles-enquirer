            "text": "Seven families of viruses contain minus-strand RNA [(\u2212)RNA], also called negative-strand RNA, as their genome. These are listed in Table 4 .1. Included in the table are the names of the genera belonging to these families and the hosts infected by these viruses. Six of the families are known to contain members that cause epidemics of serious human illness. Diseases caused by these viruses include influenza (Orthomyxoviridae), mumps and measles (Paramyxoviridae), rabies (Rhabdoviridae), encephalitis (several members of the Bunyaviridae), upper and lower respiratory tract disease (numerous viruses in the Paramyxoviridae), and hemorrhagic fever (many viruses belonging to the Bunyaviridae, the Arenaviridae, and the Filoviridae), as well as other diseases. Bornavirus, the sole representative of the Bornaviridae, also infects humans and may cause neurological illness, but proof of causality is lacking. Many of the (\u2212)RNA viruses presently infect virtually the entire human population at some point in time (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus), whereas others did so before the introduction of vaccines against them (e.g., measles virus and mumps virus). These viruses are thus responsible for a very large number of cases of human illness. The diseases caused by such widespread viruses are usually serious but have a low (although not insignificant) fatality rate. In contrast, some (\u2212)RNA viruses, such as rabies and Ebola viruses, cause illnesses with high fatality rates but (fortunately) infect only a small fraction of the human population. The (\u2212)RNA viruses are major causes of human suffering, and all seven families and the viruses that belong to these families will be described here.",

They are grouped into the order Mononegavirales (mono because the genome is in one piece, nega for negative-strand RNA). This was the first order to be recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and still is one of only three orders currently recognized. Viruses belonging to the other three families, the Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Orthomyxoviridae, possess segmented genomes with two, three, and six to eight segments, respectively. Regardless of whether the genome is one RNA molecule or is segmented, the genomes of all (\u2212)RNA viruses possess a similar suite of genes, as illustrated in Fig. 4 .1. In the Mononegavirales, the order of genes along the genome is conserved among the viruses (although the number of genes may differ). In the viruses with segmented genomes, the genes can be ordered in the same way if the segments are aligned as shown. In addition, many features of virion structure and of replication pathways are shared among the (\u2212)RNA viruses. are required to produce the mature glycoproteins, such as cleavage to release a signal peptide, cleavage to separate two glycoproteins produced as a common precursor, or cleavage to activate viral infectivity. The glycoproteins project from the lipid bilayer as spikes that are visible in the electron microscope (see, e.g., Fig. 2.18D ).",

The example of influenza virus is shown in Figs. 2.1 and 2.22D, and the paramyxovirus measles virus is shown in Fig. 2 .22C. The compositions of these virions are not rigorously fixed and some variability in the ratios of the different components, particularly in the glycoprotein content, is present. The rhabdoviruses are bullet shaped or bacilliform and appear more regular (Fig. 2.23 ), but even here variations in the composition of the glycoproteins in the envelope can occur. The filoviruses are filamentous (Fig. 2.23) . Orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses also produce filamentous forms as well as round virions (see Fig. 2 .25E). In fact, clinical isolates of influenza viruses and human respiratory syncytial virus are predominantly filamentous. The gene products are abbreviated as follows: le is a leader sequence; N is the nucleoprotein; P is the phosphoprotein; M (M1, M2) are matrix proteins; G (G1, G2) are membrane glycoproteins; F is the fusion glycoprotein; HN is the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein; L is the RNA polymerase; NA is the neuraminidase glycoprotein; HA is the hemagglutinin glycoprotein; NS (NV, SH, NSs, NSm) are nonstructural proteins; PB1, PB2, and PA are components of the influenza RNA polymerase; tr is the trailer sequence. Within a given genome, the genes are drawn approximately to scale. mRNAs for most genes would be synthesized left to right; however, an arrow over a gene means that it is in the opposite orientation (ambisense genes).

In (\u2212)RNA viruses with segmented genomes, it is obvious that multiple mRNAs are produced (the number of mRNAs produced actually exceeds the number of segments, as described later). In the Mononegavirales, multiple mRNAs arise from the use of a single polymerase entry site at the 3\u2032 end of the genome. The polymerase then recognizes conserved start and stop signals at the beginning and end of each gene to generate discrete mRNAs. The amount of mRNA produced for any given gene is controlled by the location of the gene relative to the single polymerase entry site, because mRNA synthesis is obligatorily sequential and attenuation occurs at each gene junction. Thus, more mRNA for the proteins encoded 3\u2032 in the genome is made and more protein is thus translated from these genes. The N protein, required for encapsidation of both genome and antigenome, is thereby produced in the largest quantities and the RNA polymerase, needed in the smallest quantities, is made in the smallest quantities. The synthesis of mRNAs is described in more detail in the sections on Rhabdoviridae.",

Multiple products can be produced from the same gene by the use of alternative translation initiation codons during translation of an mRNA; by the introduction of nontemplated nucleotides during mRNA synthesis, which results in a shift in the reading frame; or by splicing of an mRNA. The P genes, in particular, of most of the (\u2212)RNA viruses are translated into multiple products, and two of the segments of influenza virus, which replicates in the nucleus, can be spliced to produce a second mRNA encoding a different product. In no case are the mRNAs exact complements of virion RNAs. This is obvious in the case of the Mononegavirales, where as many as 7-10 mRNAs are produced from a single long genomic RNA, but is also true of the segmented (\u2212)RNA viruses, where the mRNAs lack cis-active sequences required for encapsidation and replication that are present near the ends of the antigenome segments.

Neither the genomic (\u2212)RNA nor the antigenomic template produced during replication is ever free in the cytoplasm. Instead, replication of the genome, as well as the synthesis of mRNAs, takes place in nucleocapsids (sometimes referred to as ribonucleoprotein or RNP), which always contain the phosphoprotein and the polymerase as well as N and the viral RNA. Replication can only occur in the presence of ongoing protein synthesis to produce the new proteins required to encapsidate the genome or antigenome. The mRNAs can be synthesized in the absence of viral protein synthesis and lack encapsidation signals, so that they are released into the cytoplasm where they can associate with ribosomes and be translated. Thus, early after infection, mRNAs are synthesized.

In other viruses, circles have not been seen but may form transiently during replication. It is possible that these complementary sequences exist to promote cyclization of the RNA, which may be required for replication of the genome or synthesis of mRNAs. It has been shown for influenza A virus that the viral RNA replicase interacts with both ends of the RNA during synthesis of RNA, similar to the story for alphaviruses and flaviviruses described in Chapter 3. Another possible explanation for the complementary sequences is that the promoter at the 3\u2032 end of the genomic RNA that is recognized by the viral RNA synthetase for the production of antigenomes is the same, at least in part, as the promoter at the 3\u2032 end of the antigenomic RNA that is used to initiate the production of genomic RNA.",

The nucleocapsid also contains about 470 molecules of P and 50 copies of L. It can synthesize RNA, and P, L, and N are all required for this activity. The organization of the genome and the production of five mRNAs from it are illustrated in Fig. 4. 2. There is a single polymerase entry site at the 3\u2032 end of the genome, and production of mRNAs is obligatorily sequential. Synthesis begins at the exact 3\u2032 end of the genome and a leader RNA of 48 nucleotides is first synthesized. The leader is released and synthesis of the first mRNA, that for N, is initiated. The RNA polymerase complex has capping activity, and the mRNA is capped during or shortly after initiation. At the end of the gene for N, the transcriptase reaches a conserved sequence AUACUUUUUUU, where it begins to stutter and produces a poly(A) tract at the 3\u2032 end of the mRNA. The polymerase complex will not terminate or stutter unless the conserved AUAC is present immediately upstream of the U 7 tract, and the sequence AUACU 7 is therefore a consensus termination-polyadenylation signal. The capped and polyadenylated mRNA for N is terminated and released, the transcriptase skips the next two nucleotides, which are referred to as the intergenic sequence, and initiates synthesis of the second mRNA, that for P, at the conserved gene start signal UUGUC. Following synthesis of this mRNA, the polymerase again stutters at the oligo(U) tract in the AUACU 7 signal to produce a poly(A) tract, releases the capped and polyadenylated mRNA, skips the next two nucleotides, and begins synthesis of the third gene, that for M. The process continues in this way through the fourth gene (the G protein) and the fifth gene (the L protein, L for large because it comprises about 60% of the genome). In this way, five capped and polyadenylated mRNAs are produced. In VSV, the intergenic sequence is always two nucleotides. After releasing the L mRNA, the polymerase complex terminates synthesis some 50 nucleotides before the 5\u2032 end of the genome is reached.",

This attenuation appears to be important for regulation of the virus life cycle, so that the mRNAs for proteins needed in most abundance are produced in most abundance. Reorganization of the genome to change the order of genes gives rise to viable virus, but the yield of such virus during an infection cycle in cultured cells, and thus the fitness of the virus, is reduced. The mRNAs for N, M, G, and L are each translated into a single protein. That for P is translated into three proteins. The major translation product of this mRNA is P, which is produced using an initiation codon near the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA. Initiation of translation also occurs at two downstream AUGs. These two downstream AUGs are in frame with one another but in a different reading frame from P. Use of these alternative AUGs leads to the synthesis of short proteins of 55 and 65 amino acids (of which the shorter protein is a truncated version of the longer one). The functions of these small proteins have not been established for VSV, but extra products translated from the P gene of the paramyxoviruses are known to interfere with host defense mechanisms, as described later.",

Replication requires producing a full-length antigenomic template, and the immediate encapsidation of the newly synthesized (+)RNA into plus-strand RNP containing N, P, and L during synthesis is required. In the absence of N for encapsidation, the system defaults to synthesis of mRNAs. The M protein also appears to regulate RNA synthesis. In the replication mode, the polymerase complex ignores all of the initiation, termination, and polyadenylation signals utilized to produce mRNAs, and instead produces a perfect complementary copy of the genome. The antigenomic RNA can be copied by the polymerase activity in the (+)RNP to produce more genomic RNA. This also requires that the RNA be immediately encapsidated. The new genomic RNP can be used to amplify the replication of viral RNA or, later in infection, can bud to produce progeny virions.",

The name of the virus comes from the vesicles that it induces on the tongue and lips. These symptoms resemble those caused by foot-and-mouth disease virus and epidemics of VSV disease in domestic animals result in disruptive quarantines as well as complications in efforts for control of FMDV. Human infection is common in rural areas where VSV is endemic in domestic animals; 25-90% of farmers in such areas may have anti-VSV antibodies, showing past infection by the virus. Human infection is largely asymptomatic or associated with a mild febrile illness, sometimes accompanied by herpeslike lesions in the mouth or on the lips or nose. Serological surverys also show that the virus infects bats, deer, and monkeys in endemic areas. The virus also replicates in numerous arthropods and has been isolated from mosquitoes, sand flies, black flies, culicoides, houseflies, and eye gnats. The natural cycle of VSV in nature is not understood and the epidemiological importance of mosquitoes or other hematophagous arthropods in transmission of the virus is not clear. VSV is endemic in Latin America from Mexico to northern South America where outbreaks of disease occur every year. VSNJV accounts for the majority of the clinical cases in this region. Sporadic outbreaks occur both north and south of this endemic area. In the United States, sporadic outbreaks occur in the Southwest at intervals of about 10 years, caused by both VSIV and VSNJV. In the Southeast, VSNJV was endemic until the 1970s. After this, VSNJV remained endemic only on Ossabaw Island off Georgia, where it is transmitted to feral pigs by sand flies. In the rest of the Southeast, no clinical disease caused by VSV has been reported since 1976 and there have been only occasional findings of seropositive wild animals.",

It is a uniformly fatal disease of man and of other mammals, and has been known since the twenty-third century b.c. Rabies virus is present in the saliva of a rabid animal and is transmitted by its bite. Infection begins in tissues surrounding the site of the bite. Without treatment the virus may be transmitted to the brain, where replication of the virus leads to the disease called rabies. It is believed that the virus enters neurons by using acetylcholine receptors as a receptor, followed by transport up the axon until it reaches the cell body. The probability that rabies will develop following the bite of a rabid animal depends on the location of the bite, the species doing the biting, and the virus strain. In the absence of treatment, bites on the face and head result in rabies in 40-80% of cases, whereas bites on the legs result in rabies in 0-10% of cases. The incubation period to development of symptomatic rabies can vary from less than a week to several years. Once the virus reaches the brain, it spreads from there to a variety of organs. To be transmitted, it must spread to the salivary glands. Infection of neurons in the brain may result in behavioral changes that cause the animal to become belligerent and bite other animals, so that the virus present in salivary fluid is transmitted. In humans, the disease may be paralytic or may result in nonspecific neurological symptoms including anxiety, agitation, and delirium. Biting behavior is not a consequence of rabies-induced neurological disease in humans, and human-to-human transmission does not occur. Two to 7 days after symptoms of rabies appear, coma and death ensue. Only three cases of humans recovering from symptomatic rabies have been recorded.",

In the late 1800s, Pasteur adapted rabies virus to laboratory animals and developed the concept of protective vaccination against rabies. The dessicated spinal cords from rabiesinfected rabbits became the first rabies vaccine. On July 6, 1885, this vaccine was used to immunize Joseph Miester, who had been bitten 14 times by a rabid dog. Because of the multiplicity of bites, he would almost surely have died, but the Pasteur vaccine saved him. A vaccine grown in nervous system tissue and inactivated by phenol rather than drying was the accepted rabies vaccine for decades. In the 1960s, a safer inactivated virus vaccine derived from virus grown in cultured human cells was introduced. The rabies vaccine is unique in that it is normally given after exposure to the virus, in conjunction with anti-rabies antiserum. This is possible because there is a window of time following the bite of a rabid animal before rabies develops, during which a protective immune response can be induced. Veterinarians and wildlife workers who are potentially exposed to rabid animals, as well as biologists who work with rabies virus in the laboratory, are immunized prophylatically, but the protective immune response can be of short duration and immunity must be tested at regular intervals.",

Fig. 4 .3 also shows the increase in rabies in wild animals since 1940. Fig. 4 .4 illustrates the explosive spread of rabies in raccoons on the eastern seaboard in the last 20 years. The focus of this spread in Virginia arose from the import of 3500 raccoons from Florida into the Washington, D.C., area by members of the cabinet of President Carter, for the purpose of raccoon hunting. These imported animals ignited an epidemic of rabies in raccoons that has slowly spread up and down the Atlantic seaboard, as shown in Fig. 4 .4. In other parts of the United States, foxes and skunks are important hosts for rabies and disease also occurs at times in wolves and coyotes. Bats are also an important carrier of rabies. In other parts of the world, where licensing and immunization of pets is not required, domestic dogs continue to be the principal vectors that transmit rabies to humans. Rabies remains a significant global health problem. More than one million people annually undergo antirabies treatment following exposure to the virus, and 50,000 people die of rabies each year.",

Virions are usually round but pleomorphic ( Fig. 2 .22C), and filamentous forms are also produced by some viruses that are more common in clinical isolates ( Fig. 2.25E ). Virions are produced by budding from the plasma membrane (Figs. 2.25E and F). The virion size differs even within a single species and the composition of the virion is not as well defined as for some enveloped viruses. There are two glycoproteins on the surface. One is a fusion protein that is required for the fusion of the viral membrane with the cell plasma membrane. Paramyxoviruses fuse with the plasma membrane, not with endosomal membranes, and fusion does not require exposure to low pH. The fusion protein is produced as a precursor called F 0 . When first synthesized, F 0 has an N-terminal signal sequence that results in its insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum during translation. The signal sequence is removed by signal peptidase and the resulting type 1 integral membrane protein is anchored by a membrane-spanning region near the C terminus. F 0 is cleaved either by cellular furin (many paramyxoviruses) or cathepsin L (henipaviruses) within the cell or by other cellular enzymes after release of the virion from the cell, depending on its sequence. Cleavage is required for the virus to be infectious and the cleavage products, F 1 (the Nterminal part of the precursor) and F 2 (the C-terminal part which is anchored in the membrane), remain covalently linked through a disulfide bond. The fusion domain consists of the N-terminal 20 amino acids of F 2 , but this domain is not fusogenic until cleavage of F 0 has occurred. Those strains whose F 0 can be cleaved intracellularly by furin (which recognizes the sequence RXRR or RXKR) or cathepsin L are able to spread systemically and in general cause serious disease. In contrast, viruses that require cleavage of F 0 by proteases after the release of (noninfectious) virions from the cell, usually at a single basic residue by trypsin-like enzymes such as Clara or miniplasmin that are limited in their distribution in the animal, cannot spread systemically and are usually restricted to the respiratory tract. F oligomerizes to form trimers that are visible as spikes on the surface of the virion. Table 4 .3.

Such an activity is called a luxury function because it is not needed for virus replication in cultured cells but is needed for a successful infection of an animal. Production of IFN is the first line of defense of birds and mammals against virus infection and the system is described in detail in Chapter 10. The importance of IFN in controlling viral infection is shown by the fact that most if not all viruses interfere with its action in some way. In paramyxoviruses, the V and C proteins act in different ways to block IFN production or its activity once induced. A potent inducer of IFN production is double-strand RNA (dsRNA), and there are at least two cellular sensors that detect dsRNA and induce the production of IFN (described in more detail in Chapter 10). Intracellular dsRNA can be sensed by a helicase called RIG-1. Through a complicated pathway involving caspase-recruitment domains (CARD), two transcription factors, IRF-3 and NF\u03baB, are activated and transported to the nucleus. These form a complex that leads to the transcription of the mRNA for IFN-\u03b2. An overlapping pathway can start from extracellular dsRNA, which is bound by a cellular receptor called Toll-like receptor 3. The resulting signal cascade results in the production of the same two activated nucleotides are inserted during transcription of P to shift the translation frame. Alternative translation start codons are also used. The result is the production of up to four proteins from this one gene. Adapted from Strauss and Strauss (1991) and Chua et al. (2000) . transcription factors. The V proteins of several paramyxoviruses interfere with either activation pathway, preventing the induction of IFN. In addition, the W protein of Nipah virus blocks the activity of IRF-3 in the nucleus. The cysteine-rich C-terminal domains of the V proteins are highly conserved and presumably work in the same way in this pathway. The V proteins, and in some cases the P proteins, also block the activity of IFN-\u03b2 once it is produced. IFN-\u03b2 is exported from the cell where it can be bound by Type I IFN receptors at the surface of the same cell or other cells. Once IFN-\u03b2 is bound, the receptor, which consists of two different subunits, heterodimerizes and associated adaptor proteins phosphorylate one another and phosphorylate transcription factors called STAT1 and STAT2. Once phosphorylated, the STATs heterodimerize and are transported to the nucleus where they form part of a transcription complex that transcribes mRNA from hundreds of IFN-responsive genes and the products of these genes establish an antiviral state. The V protein and P protein of Nipah virus cause the STATs to aggregate into large, inactive complexes. The V proteins of several other paramyxoviruses cause STAT1 or STAT2 to be degraded by proteasomes. The W proteins of Nipah virus also blocks the activity of the STATs in the nucleus by causing the proteins to aggregate. The net result of these activities is that the genes responsive to activation by IFN-\u03b2 are not transcribed and IFN activity is aborted (see also Chapter 10).",

One of the most intensively studied rubulaviruses (studied as a model system for replication of members of the family) has been SV-5 (simian virus 5). During the development of the polio vaccine, rhesus monkey kidney cells were used for replication of poliovirus in culture, and these cultures were often contaminated with monkey viruses. These simian viruses (SVs) were simply numbered as they were isolated, and any particular SV may be totally unrelated to any other. Two of the most widely studied are SV-5 and SV-40, which are not related to one another: SV-5 is an RNAcontaining paramyxovirus and SV-40 is a DNA-containing polyomavirus (Chapter 7).",

Immune suppression can result in secondary infections that may be serious, even life threatening, and interference with immune function is a major cause of measles mortality. Measles also has uncommon neurological complications, including encephalomyelitis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). In SSPE, the virus sets up a persistent but modified infection in the brain in which M protein is produced in only low amounts; downregulation of production of M protein appears to be necessary to establish the disease syndrome.

Although subhuman primates can be infected by the virus and suffer the same disease as humans, humans are the only reservoir of the virus in nature. Infection requires direct contact with an infected person and recovery from infection results in solid lifelong immunity to the virus. Thus, a minimum size population is required to maintain the virus, in which the continuing birth of new susceptibles occurs at a rate sufficient to maintain continuous virus infection within the community. The requirement for a minimum sized human population to sustain the virus is illustrated in Fig. 4 .9. In this figure, data from 1949-1964 (before tourism became as popular as it is today) are plotted that show the duration of measles epidemics on various islands. In Fig. 4 .9A, we see that an island must have a population sufficient to produce about 16,000 surviving newborns a year (population about 500,000) in order to maintain the virus continuously in the population. If the population is smaller, the epidemic burns itself out when all susceptibles have been infected. The island is then free of measles until sufficient new susceptibles have been born and measles is once again introduced into the island from outside. The smaller the population, the longer this takes. Note that Guam and Bermuda, with their heavy tourist influx, had measles present more than expected from the curve because the virus is introduced more often, that is, the island population is not truly isolated. Figure 4 .9B illustrates that the more densely packed the population, the more readily the virus spreads and therefore the sooner the epidemic burns itself out. The islands shown in this panel all have about the same population, but when the population is compressed into a smaller area, such as in Tonga, person-to-person spread is more efficient and epidemics do not last as long as when the population is dispersed over a larger area, such as in Iceland.",

These population centers were associated with the cultivation of food plants and the domestication of animals, including bovines. Measles virus is most closely related to rinderpest virus ( Fig. 4 .5), which infects cattle and swine. An obvious hypothesis is that the close contact between humans and their domesticated animals allowed rinderpest virus, or perhaps another virus of domestic animals, to jump to humans and evolve to become specific for humans.

The increased severity may have resulted from an unbalanced immune response primed by the formalin inactivated virus or to a lack of local immunity in the respiratory tract (see Chapter 10).

The live virus vaccine gives solid protection from disease caused by the virulent virus and has largely controlled the virus within the United States ( Fig.  4 .10). Following introduction of the vaccine, the number of cases dropped dramatically. The virus continued to circulate among nonimmunized individuals, however, and thousands of cases per year still occurred, sometimes associated with epidemics of more than 50,000 cases. As vaccine coverage became more effective, cases dropped to new lows, but another epidemic in 1989-1991 caused about 50,000 cases. This epidemic occurred in young immunized adults as well as in young children who had not been immunized. Some of the cases in young adults were due to vaccine failures (about 5% of humans immunized with a single dose of the measles vaccine fail to develop immunity to measles), but other cases appear to have been due to waning immunity. Thus, immunity induced by the vaccine is probably not lifelong, in contrast to natural infection by wild-type measles virus. The guidelines now call for a second immunization on entry to elementary or middle school. This not only boosts immunity in individuals whose immunity is waning, but also usually leads to immunity in those who did not develop immunity after the first dose. In addition, some colleges require immunization on entry. With these changes, the number of cases of measles in the United States was only 100 in 1998. Molecular genotyping has increased our understanding of the few cases of measles that occur annually in the United States today. In 1988-1992, all the reported isolates of measles virus were subgroup 2, the indigenous North American strain. However, by 1994-1995, all outbreaks were caused by one of four other subgroups that are endemic in other parts of the world. Thus, these outbreaks were initiated by viremic visitors from Asia and Europe. One notable outbreak is thought to have been initiated by a single visitor to Las Vegas and resulted in small epidemics in five states.",

Control has recently been established throughout most of the Americas, but measles remains a serious pathogen in other parts of the developing world. In fact, measles is the leading cause of vaccine preventable deaths in the world. The World Health Organization has initiated a campaign to eradicate measles but the campaign has met a number of stumbling blocks. Because the virus infects only humans in nature, it should be possible to eradicate it using the same techniques that were used for smallpox and that are being used for poliovirus. A major problem with measles, however, has been the inability to effectively immunize young infants against the disease before they become naturally infected by the virus. Newborns are protected from infection for 6-12 months by maternal antibodies, and a live vaccine does not take while they are thus protected. In many societies, measles is so pervasive that very shortly after the infant becomes susceptible to infection, infection by wild-type virus occurs, thus keeping wild-type virus in circulation. As described in Chapter 10, attempts to overcome maternal immunity by increasing the dose of the vaccine virus have not led to satisfactory results. New guidelines being developed recommend multiple immunizations against measles in such circumstances, starting at an earlier age, in order to catch the child with the vaccine as soon as it becomes susceptible to the virus.",

This neuraminidase activity differs in its specificity from that exhibited by the respiroviruses and the orthomyxoviruses, explaining why it had not been observed previously.

Immunity following infection is incomplete and reinfection is common in children and adults, but reinfection tends to produce less severe disease. Symptoms can include bronchitis and pharyngitis (itis = inflammation, so inflammation of the mucous membranes of the bronchi or pharynx), rhinorrhea (runny nose), cough, headache, fatigue, and fever. Pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs in which the air sacs become filled with exudate) can result, particularly in infants or the elderly. It is estimated that 17,000 people in the United States die annually from RSV infection, and the great majority of these are people over 65 years old. RSV infection is particularly serious in the immunocompromised. As one example, individuals of any age undergoing bone marrow transplantation have a 90% mortality rate if infected by RSV.",

Because of the widespread prevalence of infection by the virus and the severity of the disease it causes, especially in infants, efforts are ongoing to develop a vaccine that would provide protection against disease or that would at least protect against severe disease. A clinical trial with an inactivated virus vaccine in a group of children some years ago gave disastrous results, however. Not only did the inoculation with the candidate vaccine fail to protect the children against subsequent infection by RSV, but it was found that when infected the vaccinated group suffered a much higher proportion of serious illnesses such as viral pneumonia than did the control group. Thus, immunization potentiated illness, possibly because of an unbalanced immune response. This result has impeded efforts to develop a vaccine and made it clear that a better understanding of the interaction of the virus with the immune system is important.",

Four species of Ebolavirus are known, three from Africa (Zaire, Sudan, and Ivory Coast ebolaviruses) and one from the Philippines and/or Southeast Asia (Reston ebolavirus). The filovirus genome is 19 kb in size and contains seven genes, which result in the production of seven or eight proteins following infection ( Fig. 4.1) . The biology of filoviruses has been very difficult to study. Most filoviruses are severe human pathogens that must be handled under biosafety level 4 conditions (BSL-4), which restricts the number of laboratories that can work with the virus and the number of experiments that can be done. Furthermore, until recently the reservoir of the virus in nature was unknown, limiting studies of the ecology of the virus. A dendrogram showing the relationships among the filoviruses is shown in Fig. 4.11 .",

It has a nonsegmented, minus-sense genome of 8.9 kb, containing, by one definition, five genes. The general organization of the genome and the suite of genes contained in the genome resembles that of other members of the Mononegavirales (Fig. 4.1) . However, the virus replicates in the nucleus, not in the cytoplasm. Splicing of mRNAs occurs to form an incompletely characterized set of alternatively spliced mRNAs from the five genes. Furthermore, alternative start codons are used during translation of some of the mRNAs, a trait shared with other (\u2212)RNA viruses, so that overlapping open reading frames are present in some of the genes. Overall, the number of protein products produced and the complexity of the readout of the genome exceed that of other (\u2212)RNA viruses. The genome organization and transcriptional map of Borna disease virus, as currently understood, is shown in Fig. 4 .12. Borna disease virus is neurotropic and establishes a chronic or persistent infection despite an immune response to viral infection. The chronic infection results at least in part because the virus downregulates its replication, resulting in very low production of infectious virus. Downregulation to establish a persistent infection uses a mechanism different from those described in Chapter 3 for alphaviruses (shutoff of minus-strand RNA) and for pestiviruses (titration of a cellular component required for RNA replication). Borna disease virus, like other (\u2212)RNA viruses, has an inverted terminal repeat at the ends of the genomic RNA that contains promoters for RNA replication. During replication, the four terminal nucleotides at the 5\u2032 ends of both the genomic and antigenomic RNA are often trimmed so that the majority of RNAs are missing these four nucleotides. The truncated RNA can be transcribed to produce mRNA but cannot replicate, thus resulting in downregulation of RNA replication.",

Experimentally infected rats and primates also exhibit behavioral abnormalities. Because of these effects on other animals, several recent studies have tried to determine if the virus is associated with neurological disease in man, in particular with schizophrenia. Serological surveys have found that psychiatric patients are more likely to have antibodies to bornavirus than normal controls. Surveys which assay for the presence of viral RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) are even more suggestive: in some surverys up to 66% of psychiatric patients, including schizophrenics, are positive for bornaviral RNA, compared to <5% of normal controls. Furthermore, very small amounts of virus-specific RNA have been isolated from postmortem brain samples from patients suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but not from normal individuals or patients suffering from other neurological disorders. Interestingly, a recent study found that two patients hospitalized for severe depression exhibited a rise in bornavirus antigen in PMBCs during the course of the disease, which fell to very low levels on recovery. Whether these different associations are indicative of causality remains to be determined, but it is conceivable that the virus causes recurrent episodes of depression on reactivation of a latent infection.",

It binds to RNAs in the nucleus, including cellular pre-mRNAs, cellular snRNAs which are involved in splicing, and dsRNA. Its activities inhibit the transport of cellular mRNAs from the nucleus and promote the synthesis of influenza mRNA. NS1 also regulates splicing of influenza mRNAs and their transport from the nucleus to the cytosol. Another function of NS1 is to interfere with the interferon pathway (Chapter 10), in part by binding dsRNA, which is a major inducer of interferon and a cofactor for some proteins in the interferon response to viruses, and in part by interacting with cellular proteins involved in the interferon response. Influenza virus lacking NS1 is very sensitive to interferon and is replication defective in cells or hosts capable of synthesizing interferon, whereas the wild-type virus is resistant to the interferon pathway. NS2 is produced from a spliced mRNA. It interacts with M1 attached to influenza RNP and promotes the transport of the RNP to the cytoplasm. It is present in small quantities in the virion and so is not truly nonstructural. Protein M2 is produced from a spliced mRNA from segment 7. It forms ion channels in membranes, probably as a tetramer, that allow passage of H + ions. During transport of HA to the cell surface, the presence of M2 in the membrane of the transport vesicle causes the pH within the vesicle to equilibrate with that in the cytosol. This prevents low pH activation of the fusion activity of HA during transport, because transport vesicles are otherwise acidic. M2 is also present in virions and is required for the disassembly of the virus and for the activation of the RNA polymerase activity. To become active, the polymerase in the interior of the virus must be exposed to low pH. Influenza virus enters the cell in endosomes, which are progressively acidified. The acidic pH not only triggers a conformational change in HA that results in fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane, but it also activates the RNA polymerase of the virion through the activity of M2. M2 is the target of the drug amantadine, one of the relatively few drugs that are effective against a viral disease. Amantadine binds M2 of most influenza strains and prevents it from acting as an ion channel, which prevents the activation of the polymerase. When taken early during infection, amantidine ameliorates the symptoms of influenza. A worrisome trend is the appearance of amantidine-resistant variants of influenza, in particular the H5N1 strain referred to as \"bird flu.\"",

The precursor is called HA 0 and the cleaved products are called HA 1 and HA 2 (which remain covalently linked by a disulfide bond after cleavage of the peptide bond) (Fig. 1.6 ). Cleavage is required to activate the fusion activity of the virus and the nature of the cleavage site influences the virulence of the virus. If the cleavage site consists of a single basic amino acid, cleavage is extracellular and influenza replication is restricted to the respiratory tract, and in the case of birds the gut as well, where there are enzymes that can cleave this site. If the cleavage site consists of multiple basic residues that can be recognized by the intracellular enzyme furin, the virus can replicate systemically in at least some hosts. The SV-5 type 1 glycoprotein has only fusion activity and is called F. As described before, it is produced as a precursor F 0 which is cleaved to F 1 and F 2 , and the nature of the cleavage site affects the virulence of the virus (see Viral Glycoproteins under Paramyxoviridae earlier in this chapter).",

This makes possible the differential splicing observed for two of the mRNAs. Following infection by the virus, the viral RNPs are transported to the nucleus and mRNA synthesis begins. During synthesis of mRNA, influenza engages in a process called \"cap-snatching.\" Capped cellular pre-mRNAs present in the nucleus are bound by NS1, and the 5\u00a2-terminal 10-13 nucleotides, containing the 5\u00a2 cap, are removed by PB2. This oligonucleotide is used to prime synthesis of mRNA from the influenza genome segments, as illustrated in Fig. 4 .13. Once initiated, other aspects of mRNA synthesis resemble those that occur in rhabdo-and paramyxoviruses. Synthesis continues to near the end of the genome segment, where an oligo(U) stretch is encountered. Here the enzyme stutters to produce a poly(A) tail on the messenger and then releases it. In addition to its role as a primer, using a cap derived from cellular mRNA relieves the virus of the necessity of encoding enzymes required for capping and ensures that the virus mRNA has a cap suitable for the cell in which it is replicating. This mechanism also results in interference with the synthesis and transport of host mRNAs. Furthermore, because the mRNAs have a different 5\u00a2 end and lack the 3\u00a2 end of the antigenomic RNA, they lack promoters required for replication and packaging and are therefore dedicated mRNAs.",

Replication requires encapsidation of progeny genomic and antigenomic RNAs as described for other (\u2212)RNA viruses, and the mechanisms that lead to a switch between synthesis of mRNAs and replication are thought to be similar to those that occur in rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses. During replication, the viral genome is copied into a faithful antigenomic RNA (vcRNA) (Fig. 4.13) , which is a perfect complement of the genome and serves as a template for production of genomic RNA. Synthesis of viral RNA, whether plus strand or minus strand, requires that the synthetase interact with both ends of the RNA, whether vRNA or vcRNA; that is, the promoter for synthesis of RNA is composed of elements from both ends of the RNA. This is analogous to what has been found for alphaviruses and flaviviruses, described in Chapter 3, and may be a general mechanism used by many or all RNA viruses. Thirteen nucleotides at the 5\u00a2 end of the vRNA and 12 nucleotides at the 3\u00a2 end are highly conserved in influenza A viruses and these seem to contain the entire promoter element. These sequences form an inverted terminal repeat and are capable of forming a panhandle structure (Fig 4.15A) , bringing the two ends together where they might interact with the RNA synthetic machinery. An alternative structure, called the corkscrew structure, is thought to be the structure recognized by the synthetase for initiation of RNA synthesis (Fig. 4.15B) . Cyclization is also hypothesized to play a role in addition of poly(A) to mRNAs, by causing the polymerase to stutter at the oligo(U) tract located just before the doublestrand stem of the circular structure. Figure 4 .15C illustrates an experiment to examine the sequence requirements within the panhandle or corkscrew structure.",

Studies of a strain of influenza A that remained filamentous after passage in cell culture could be induced to form spherical particles by changes in the M1 protein.

Reassortment to produce viruses with mixed genomes is efficient-the segments are almost randomly reassorted to give all possible combinations of genome segments in the progeny virions. This process is analogous to the reassortment of chromosomes that takes place during sexual reproduction in diploid organisms. Budding must result in the packaging of the 8 different genomic segments that constitute the viral genome into one virus particle if it is to be infectious. Reoviruses (Chapter 5) have an assembly mechanism whereby the 10-12 different segments are recognized and assorted so that each virus particle has one each of the different segments. The case for influenza virus is not completely clear. Evidence has been presented that the virus appears to package more than 8 segments, possibly about 10, that are randomly chosen from the intracellular pool. Random packaging of 10 segments would result by chance in about 3% of the virions having at least 1 each of the 8 different genome segments. However, more recent data argue that the virions package exactly 8 segments, one each of the 8 different segments. For this to occur, the packaging machinery has to recognize internal sequences in each of the segments and not just a packaging signal in the conserved ends of the viral RNAs.",

The major reservoirs of influenza A in nature are wild ducks and other waterfowl such as gulls, terns, and shearwaters, and viruses containing all 16 subtypes of HA and all 9 subtypes of NA have been isolated from waterfowl. Influenza replicates in the lung and in the gut of birds and the infection is normally asymptomatic (but epidemics of fatal influenza have occurred in turkeys and chickens, and the emerging H5N1 virus has caused fatal infection in a number of different bird species). Ducks can excrete virus in feces for weeks, infecting other ducks via contaminated water, and a significant fraction of ducks may become infected by the virus in this process. Migratory ducks then spread the virus around the world, normally in a north-south direction. The viruses in birds are in stasis. Almost no differences in amino acid sequences of the various proteins are present in viruses separated by many decades, although the nucleic acid sequences encoding these proteins do drift.

Not all combinations of genes give rise to viruses that are capable of epidemic spread in humans. Only three subtypes of HA (H1, H2, and H3) and two or three subtypes of NA (N1, N2, and possibly N8) have been found to date in epidemic strains of human influenza virus. The first influenza virus isolated, in 1933, was called H1N1. This virus first appeared as the cause of the great influenza epidemic of 1918 (see later). The virus isolated in the epidemic of 1957 had a different subtype of both HA and NA and was called H2N2. The H2N2 virus replaced the H1N1 virus as the cause of influenza epidemics (Fig. 4.17 ). The H2N2 virus was itself replaced by H3N2 virus beginning with the epidemic of 1968. Serological surveys suggest that prior to 1918 the virus that circulated was an H3N8 virus that first appeared as the cause of an epidemic in 1890. The reason that only a subset of HAs appear to be capable of causing epidemics in humans is, at least in part, the fact that the receptors for the virus are somewhat different in birds and humans.

NS1 is also at least partially host specific and thus only certain NS1s are compatible with human infection. Other proteins also differ somewhat for optimal replication in birds versus mammals. It is thought that reassortment can result in the introduction of a new HA or NA gene into a human virus, that is, a virus whose other gene segments are optimized for human infection. The HA and NA proteins are the most important antigens of the virus, and change of one or both of these antigens gives rise to a virus for which the majority of the human population has no immunity and which is therefore capable of causing a global pandemic. One possible scenario is that pigs serve as intermediates (\"mixing vessels\") in the recombination process, because pigs can be infected by both avian and human viruses (they contain sialic acid in both \u03b12,3 and \u03b12,6 linkage) and reassortment could occur in this host.",

Although the very young and the elderly are normally at the most risk from influenza, this influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 was unusual in that mortality was highest in healthy young adults. The age distributions of people dying of influenza and the related pneumonia are compared for the years 1917 and 1918 in Fig.  4 .18. The much higher death rates in the young and the el-derly in 1917, the normal pattern, is apparent. The dramatic increase in the death rate in the 20-to 29-year-old group in 1918, in which people of this age were more likely to die than the old and the young, is striking. Death rates in young adults 15-34 years of age were more than 20-fold higher in the 1918-1919 pandemic than in the preceding years, and the death toll in young adults in the United States was high enough that overall life expectancy dropped sharply, as illustrated in Fig. 4.19 .",

Descriptions of the epidemic with a focus on its effects on U.S. society are found in the books Flu, by G. Kolata, America's Forgotten Pandemic, by A. W. Crosby, and, quite recently The Great Influenza, by John M. Barry. The reasons for the extreme virulence of the 1918 virus, and why healthy young people were more likely to die, a topic made even more important by the appearance of H5N1 \"bird flu\" (see Chapter 8) have been addressed recently using the power of modern molecular biology. The pandemic of 1918 occurred before influenza virus could be isolated. However, the sequences of all eight gene segments of the 1918 influenza genes have been obtained starting from a number of tissue isolates. Samples of preserved lung tissue taken at autopsy from two U.S. soldiers who died of influenza in September 1918 in New York and South Carolina were found to contain detectable influenza RNA, albeit in fragmented condition. A third source of influenza RNA came from an Alaskan Inuit victim who died in November 1918 and was buried in permafrost, and whose body was sufficiently well preserved that lung samples containing (fragmented) viral RNA were obtained. Two additional sources of influenza sequences come from two victims of influenza who died of pneumonia in November 1918 and February 1919 at the Royal London Hospital. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technology was used to obtain sequences from influenza RNA in these tissue samples that could be used to reconstruct the complete sequences of genome segments. The sequences from these five victims are almost identical and showed that the virus belonged to strain H1N1. The HA genes from these five humans differ by only one to three nucleotides despite the fact that they came from five humans whose deaths were separated by over 7500 miles and several months in time. The sequence of this gene places it in the human-swine lineage, not in the avian lineage, and at the root of the tree leading to later isolates of human or swine influenza (Fig. 4.20) . Thus, the HA of the virus does not appear to have come directly from an avian source.",

Infectious influenza virus is produced and buds from the cell. Using this system influenza virus has been produced that contains various combinations of the 1918 HA and NA genes with other cloned genes from the 1918 virus or from recent isolates, including virus that contains the complete complement of the 1918 genes and thus is a complete reconstruction of the 1918 virus.

Certain elements of the innate response were attenuated, perhaps because of the activity of the NS1 gene which is known to interfere with the immune response. In contrast, other immune responses, in particular inflammatory cytokines, were enhanced, resulting in a \"cytokine storm.\" The results are consistent with the hypothesis that in humans the 1918 virus provoked an extreme but unbalanced reaction by the immune system, and that healthy young people, who have the strongest immune systems, suffered from more extensive release of potent cytokines that resulted in more extensive tissue destruction.",

Adapted from Fanning et al. (2002) . strains that arise from antigenic drift and of new subtypes that arise from antigenic shift lead to continuing epidemics. Normally, two or three strains of influenza A circulate in the human population at any one time. Spread from person to person is by respiratory droplets, requiring close proximity, but people travel extensively and new strains of the virus speed around the globe as they arise. Antigenic drift is the process by which mutations accumulate in the virus genome, usually because of immune selection, that result in the development of new strains of the virus. These new strains are partially resistant to the immunity induced by infection with previous strains of virus. After several years of drift, the strain may be sufficiently distinct to cause disease in a person previously infected, but the illness is usually less severe because of partial immunity to the new strain. However, new strains capable of causing serious illness can arise by antigenic shift whereby reassortment results in change of the surface glycoproteins of the virus. The reassortants that cause the biggest problems are those belonging to a new subtype (as illustrated by Fig. 4.17 ). As described, such a new subtype may cause a pandemic in the human population because there is little immunity to the virus carrying these new surface antigens, as happened in 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2). H1N1 virus, which had disappeared with the appearance of the H2N2 epidemic strain in 1957, suddenly reappeared in 1977. This H1N1 virus, which first appeared in northern China in May 1977 and was called the Russian flu, was virtually identical to influenza virus isolated from an epidemic in humans in 1950. It circulated in young people who had not been exposed to H1N1 virus. Because it was virtually unchanged despite 27 years having elapsed, it seems unlikely that it arose again de novo. Presumably this virus had been preserved in a frozen state, probably in a laboratory freezer. In 1976, in response to reports that investigators outside Western Europe planned to develop and test vaccines against H1N1 influenza, a WHO meeting report urged extreme caution in developing live vaccines from epidemic H1N1 strains because of the possibility of spread of the virus. One year later the virus reappeared.",

One possibility that is being pursued is to use influenza A M2 protein as an antigen. This protein is highly conserved among all A strains but is not normally seen by the immune system for some reason. Preliminary studies have shown that this protein linked to hepatitis B core protein is highly immunogenic in mice and provides protection against influenza A infection in mice, regardless of strain.

This surveillance also serves to watch for the possible appearance of another killer strain of influenza. An episode that occurred during the Ford administration, however, illustrates the potential difficulties of identifying such a strain and reacting in time. In February of 1976, a young soldier at Fort Dix died of influenza and others became seriously ill. Tests showed that most of the soldiers were suffering from the A/Victoria strain of influenza that was epidemic in the United States at the time or from adenovirus infection. However, the soldier who died and three other soldiers who were ill were infected with an influenza strain that was epidemic in pigs, referred to as swine flu. Serology studies indicated that 200 or more other soldiers had been infected by this virus as well, showing that the virus was being transmitted from person to person. The swine flu virus was closely related to the 1918 pandemic virus, and is thought to have been introduced into pigs in 1918 from humans and to have continued to circulate in pigs after it had died out in humans. Could it be possible that the 1918 virus had reappeared as an epidemic virus in humans? The decision was made by President Ford, in consulation with leading scientists, to begin a crash program to develop a vaccine against swine flu and to begin to immunize the American population. It was thought, with some justification, that to wait for an epidemic to begin before an immunization program was undertaken would mean that it would be too late to be effective, given the speed with which influenza epidemics spread. Further, influenza is usually epidemic in winter, and the early detection of this virus made possible the preparation of a vaccine before the (next) winter flu season set in. Forty million Americans were immunized against swine flu. No epidemic of swine flu developed, however, and litigation began. The pharmaceutical companies had been reluctant to participate in the program, pointing out that at any one time a certain fraction of Americans would develop encephalitis or rheumatoid arthritis or any one of hundreds of other diseases. If disease developed in proximity to receiving a new and relatively untested vaccine, a lawsuit would certainly follow and the potential damages were enormous. The program could only advance when Congress agreed to indemnify the pharmaceutical houses. The vaccine was never conclusively shown to cause disease, although there seemed to be a slight increase of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome following inoculation. Litigation went on for years and substantial damages were paid out. In retrospect it is easy to criticize the program as an overreaction, but what would have been the reaction if nothing had been done and an influenza epidemic developed that resulted in 50-100 million Americans becoming seriously ill with 1-2 million deaths? Given the state of knowledge at the time, many leaders felt there was no choice. Further, the decision to vaccinate was not so different from current policy, where strains of influenza A circulating in the spring are incorporated into a vaccine to be given in the fall. A quote from the U.S. Surgeon General at a meeting of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officiers in 1957 is worth thinking about: \"I am sure that what any of us do, we will be criticized either for doing too much or for doing too little.\"",

The culprit was an avian influenza (H5N1) that was epidemic in birds being sold in the markets for food. Avian viruses do not normally infect people, and there was fear that an avian virus had made the jump to humans and might cause an epidemic of lethal influenza. The Hong Kong authorities destroyed 1.6 million domestic birds in order to eradicate the epidemic in birds. No human-to-human transmission took place and the virus disappeared. In 2002, however, H5N1 virus reappeared and by 2006 it has spread throughout Asia and into Africa and Europe. This virus has a mortality rate of about 50% in humans and more than 140 people have died of H5N1 infection as of this date. There is no person-to-person transmission to date, but there is concern that the virus might mutate and cause a wide and devastating pandemic of influenza. This subject is considered at more length in Chapter 8.",

For this reason, the current strain of circulating influenza B is included in the annual flu vaccine. However, wide-ranging pandemics do not occur and the virus is therefore not as much of a problem as influenza A. Less attention has accordingly been given to the study of this virus. Influenza C is not a serious human pathogen and has been even less well studied. ",

Some of these pathogens were listed in Table 3 .11, which contains a partial listing of arboviruses that cause disease in humans. All members of the Bunyaviridae except the hantaviruses are transmitted to their vertebrate or plant hosts by arthropods, and transovarial transmission is important in the maintenance of many of the arboviruses in nature. The hantaviruses, in contrast, are associated with rodents and are transmitted to humans by aerosolized excreta from infected rodents.

The promoter for mRNA synthesis and for RNA replication involves nucleotides located at both ends of the genomic template, which are complementary and form hairpin circles, but with some unpaired nucleotides that are thought to be important recognition signals (Table 4 .11). Thus, as with many other RNA viruses, the viral RNA polymerase must interact with both ends of the RNA template in order to initiate synthesis, and complementarity between nucleotides at the 5\u00a2 and 3\u00a2 ends is required for promoter recognition.

It encapsidates the viral RNA, interacts with L to synthesize viral RNAs, and is believed to interact with one of the glycoproteins during virus assembly.

About 100 cases per year of encephalitis are caused by La Crosse virus, concentrated in the Midwest. Mortality is low (0.3%) but 10% of patients suffer neurological sequelae. No vaccine exists for the virus and control measures have involved control of the mosquito vector. The principal vector of La Crosse is Aedes triseriatus. This mosquito breeds in tree holes, but abandoned tires filled with rainwater constitute an important breeding area for it close to human habitation. Such abandoned tires serve as a beautiful incubator for the development of mosquito larvae, and efforts to eliminate this source of mosquitoes, as well as the institution of other mosquito control measures, has resulted in a reduction in the number of cases of disease.",

The most important of these is Rift Valley fever virus, an African virus that was first isolated in 1930 in the Rift Valley of East Africa. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes hemorrhagic fever in humans. It also causes disease in domestic animals, and many widespread epidemics in cattle, sheep, and humans have occurred over the years in Africa. In 1977 -1978 example, an epizootic in Egypt infected 25-50% of cattle and sheep in some areas, and 200,000 human cases resulted in at least 600 deaths. A more recent large epidemic in East Africa in 1997-1998 was associated with the heavi-est rainfall in 35 years, 60-100 times normal in some areas. As described before, the epidemic was caused by Rift Valley fever virus and by Garissa virus. Losses of 70% of sheep and goats and 20-30% of cattle and camels were reported, and there were hundreds of cases of human hemorrhagic fever. Contact with livestock was statistically associated with acute infection with Rift Valley fever virus, indicating that during epidemics contact transmission becomes important as a means of spread to humans. Laboratory-acquired cases contracted through aerosols are also known.",

Puumula virus occurs in Western Europe (Fig. 4.25) and causes a disease characterized by acute fever with renal involvement. Seoul virus, first identified in Seoul, Korea, is associated with wild urban rats (Rattus norvegicus) and has been found all over the world because wild urban rats have been inadvertently introduced almost everywhere. It causes a mild form of Korean hemorrhagic fever in Seoul but does not cause apparent illness in most other areas where it has been found. The discovery of Seoul virus led to an intensive study of rats in central Baltimore, where it was found that a high percentage of them were infected with Seoul virus and, furthermore, that a substantial fraction of the people living in the slums of downtown Baltimore showed evidence of infection by hantavirus. No disease is known to be associated with this virus, but statistical studies suggest that infection may lead to high blood pressure and, possibly, renal failure. The New World hantaviruses that cause disease in humans cause a syndrome called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome or HPS, which has a fatality rate of 20-40%. The first such virus to be identified was Sin Nombre virus, which caused an epidemic of HPS in the Four Corners area of the United States in 1993 that resulted in about 25 deaths. The virus is associated with the deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus. Sin Nombre virus or related viruses have now been identified in virtually all states within the United States and into Latin America, and fatalities due to infection by the virus have occurred in many states. One of the cases in California is of interest because the person died more than a year before the Four Corners epidemic; retrospective studies of serum collected from the patient at the time of his hospitalization showed that he was infected with a hantavirus. The number of cases of HPS in the Americas from 1993 to 1998, totaled by country, and the names of the viruses responsible in various areas are shown in Fig. 4 .26. Of interest is Andes virus, which has the potential for human-to-human transmission.",

There is an N-terminal signal sequence that leads to the insertion of the precursor called GPC into the endoplasmic reticulum. The signal sequence is removed by cellular signalase. The resulting precursor is cleaved by the cellular subtilase SKI-1/S1P, the same enzyme that processes the hantavirus glycoprotein precursor, into the N-terminal G N (sometimes called G1 or GP-1) and the C-terminal G C (sometimes called G2 or GP-2). G N and G C remain associated as a heterodimer.

Many cause hemorrhagic fever in humans following infection by aerosolized virus excreted in urine or feces. They appear to have coevolved with their hosts: An evolutionary tree of arenaviruses resembles the tree that describes their rodent hosts, as was true of the hantaviruses. The many similarities in genome organization and expression, the association with a single rodent species, and the nature of the disease caused in humans all suggest that the arenaviruses are closely related to the hantaviruses. A reasonable hypothesis is that the arenaviruses arose from the hantaviruses by fusion of the S and M segments to form one segment, which allowed finer control of the virus life cycle.",

This protein is widely distributed in animals and many arenaviruses have a broad tissue tropism. For example, Lassa infection of humans results in high virus titers in spleen, lung, liver, kidney, heart, placenta, and mammary gland. Viruses that have a high binding affinity for \u03b1-dystroglycan replicate preferentially in the white pulp of the spleen and infect large numbers of lymphocytes that are important in the immune response to viral infection. The ability of these lymphocytes to act as antigen-presenting cells results in impairment of immune responses resulting in a generalized immunosuppression. Such viruses are more virulent than those that bind less avidly to \u03b1-dystroglycan. Immunosuppression may be important for the establishment of persistent infections in the rodent host, in which the virus does not cause disease. of two segments of RNA, L and S. Both segments are expressed using an ambisense strategy. The nucleocapsid protein mRNA is synthesized from the 3\u00a2 end of the genomic S RNA, while the GPC mRNA is synthesized from the vc S RNA. A similar strategy occurs with the L segment. In this case, however, more than 95% of the coding capacity is used for the L protein, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Also note that the 5\u00a2 nontranslated region of L mRNA is 157 nt, which is unusually long for an arenavirus.

Mice are small, reproduce rapidly, and there is a great deal of experience in maintaining this animal in the laboratory.

The diseases caused by these viruses are often referred to as emerging diseases because the number of human cases has increased with development and expanding populations. The increasing number of cases results from development of the pampas or other areas for farming, bringing humans in closer association with the rodent reservoirs. Furthermore, the storage of grain near human habitation results in an increase in the local rodent population, and plowing of the fields leads to the production of aerosols which may transmit the disease to humans. An attenuated virus vaccine against Jun\u00edn virus has been developed and is widely used in populations at risk. The vaccine is effective and has reduced dramatically the number of cases of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. No vaccines are in use for the other viruses, however.",

The (\u2212)RNA viruses with segmented genomes also have the ability to undergo ready reassortment, which is clearly advantageous in the Orthomyxoviridae and probably important for all viruses with segmented genomes. (+)RNA viruses that infect animals do not have segmented genomes, except for a few insect viruses with bipartite genomes, for reasons that are not clear. (+)RNA viruses of plants with segmented genomes are common, however. It is perhaps suggestive that the (\u2212)RNA viruses have not been as successful in plants as they have been in animals, and the (\u2212)RNA plant viruses that do exist also replicate in arthropods, which serve as vectors for transmitting the virus to plants.",
