Numerous studies are being conducted to identify B-cell epitopes because the localisation of these specific areas is of clinical interest for the development of diagnostic tools, vaccines and immunotherapies.

This classification is tightly related to the different experimental techniques developed to locate epitopes on antigens. The ability of synthetic overlapping peptides to bind antibodies leads to the identification of continuous epitopes. Usually, such epitopes consist of peptides of around ten amino acids, but their minimum size remains poorly defined (Van Regenmortel, 2006) . In the context of allergic response, the identification of critical amino acids for antibodybinding may be useful in the development of immunotherapy strategies by modifying B-cell epitopes to prevent IgE binding while preserving T cell epitopes (e.g., Cocco et al., 2003; Robotham et al., 2002) .",

The creation of a random peptide library displayed at the surface of phages or yeasts followed by immunopanning, whereby antibodies bind to surfaceexposed peptides that mimic the epitopes, is an alternative method to identify discontinuous epitopes known as the mimotopes technique (Levy et al., 2007; Prabakaran et al., 2006; Riemer et al., 2004) . Nevertheless, the fine identification of discontinuous epitopes is generally achieved by microscopic techniques that resolve antigen-antibody complexes, such as the electron-microscopy density map (e.g., Belnap et al., 2003) , the NMR (e.g., Morgan et al., 2004; Naik et al., 2008 ) and X-ray crystallography (e.g., Padavattan et al., 2007) . Epitopes are then deduced from these observations by identifying the points of contact between the two molecules at the atomic level, which usually encompasses between 15 and 22 amino acids (Rubinstein et al., 2008; Van Regenmortel, 1996) .",

Consequently, the antibody repertoire contains an almost infinite capacity to bind various peptides with different affinities. Accurate prediction tools could therefore help by reducing the number of potential epitopes. Further, the development of experimental techniques increases our understanding of these epitopes and their binding characteristics. B-cell epitope-specific databases centralise this information and enable statistical studies to describe B-cell epitopes in a predictive manner. AntiJen (Toseland et al., 2005) mainly contains continuous epitopes whereas Epitome (Schlessinger et al., 2006) is composed of epitopes identified from the structural analysis of antigen-antibody complexes. The Immune Epitope DataBase (Vita et al., 2010) gathers data on both B and T cell epitopes that have been curated from several publicly available databases, the scientific literature and those directly submitted by authors. Epitopes collected in such databases are described by their amino acid sequences plus the residue positions within the antigen sequences, particularly for discontinuous epitopes.",

            "text": "The most cited characteristic of an epitope is its presence on the protein surface. It is generally calculated from the three dimensional structures by determining the solvent-accessible surface (SAS) of the residues or by examination of their protrusion index, an alternative to the influence of atomic radii parameter on surface computations (Pintar et al., 2002) . The importance of surface exposure for antibody binding has been observed for the first time by Novotn\u00fd et al. (1986) and Thornton et al. (1986) using lysozyme, myoglobin, cytochrome c and myohemerythrin. This surface exposure characteristic has even been integrated with experimental work as a confirmation of in vitro epitope identification methods (Dolimbek et al., 2008; L\u00f3pez-Torrej\u00f3n et al., 2007; Robotham et al., 2009) and as an element of the epitope localisation by the mimotope technique (Pacios et al., 2008; Tordesillas et al., 2009 ). The basic assumption that epitopes will be found in regions of proteins that have a high degree of exposure to the solvent was also an element taken into account for both continuous and discontinuous epitope predictions. Epitope predictions are based on either protein sequence or three dimensional structure. In this last case, SAS visualisation of the known or homology-modelled antigen structure is often associated with changes in the electrostatic potential and these two features enable to select candidate sequences for immunoassays or for directed mutagenesis to build less reactive molecules (Garc\u00eda-Casado et al., 2003; Sordet et al., 2009) . Moreover, the accessible characteristic of epitopic elements is one of those integrated into prediction servers based on 3D structures, such as Discotope (Haste Andersen et al., 2006) and Ellipro (Ponomarenko et al., 2008) .",

However, a complete benchmark of the available scales from the AAindex database, including the surface accessibility propensity (Emini et al., 1985) , has been achieved by Blythe and Flower (2005) and displays a weak predictive performance. As an illustration of these results, a recent work comparing experimental data with epitope predictions does not show a correlation between the continuous epitopes identified and the computed sur-face accessibility for the dengue virus 3 protein sequence (da Silva et al., 2009) . Aiming to improve the accuracy of continuous B-cell epitope predictions, some other tools using learning approaches have since been developed to classify sequences from two types of datasets: one from epitope fragments and one from non-epitope fragments. Indeed, these methods slightly improve performance predictions compared to amino acid scales; however, one drawback is that they work in a black box without giving any consideration to the underlying molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, their nonepitope dataset construction collects randomly selected fragments from SWISS-PROT database or randomly constructed peptides (El-Manzalawy et al., 2008; Saha and Raghava, 2006) . These true negative datasets cannot be validated but their content may influence the prediction accuracy. The incorporation of structural predictions about secondary structures and solvent accessibility into the learning techniques of support vector machines seems to improve slightly the outcome, particularly improving specificity at the expense of sensitivity (Sweredoski and Baldi, 2009 ). Unfortunately, this work requires entire protein sequences and as a consequence it has been done on a very limited dataset (14 well known antigens and HIV antigenic proteins).",

The second value corresponds to the protrusion index of the alpha-carbon of each residue, as described by Pintar et al. to compare the CX results with the solvent accessibility values. In other words, the maximum value represents the protrusion of the residue side chain whereas the c-alpha value represents the protrusion of the amino acid due to the structure folding. The mean atom value per residue corresponds to the third value, which represents its average protrusion from the protein surface. As expected, maximum and c-alpha protrusion values are generally correlated (spearman correlation rho = 0.9017408, p-value < 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u221216 ).

However, the PI seems to better represent the shape of the protein surface because that value takes into account the surrounding atoms. Thus, the epitopic amino acids displaying more than 50% of RSA (i.e., a ratio greater than 0.5) do not systematically appear as prominent areas on the molecule's surface; the structures TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME TOXIN-1 X-ray diffraction 3 3 8LYS",

The almost complete coverage of epitopes all along some of the sequences was also surprising. As such, the relationship between the number of bibliographic references and the overlapping of the identified epitopes was examined on several structures and the results are presented in Fig. 4 . The 2VUA structure represents the A type botulinum enterotoxin heavy chain and four bibliographic references report epitopes. The 3BLG structure represents a milk allergen for which nine references report identified epitopes. The 2ZB6 structure represents a fragment of the measles hemagglutinin protein referred to in seven references. Finally, the 1AG2 structure represents a fragment of a prion protein where epitopes have been collected from 10 references. The domains corresponding to the structures of 2VUA and 2ZB6 are responsible for the binding of the toxins to cells and are therefore studied in immunotherapy contexts. With the exception of the 2VUA structure, some areas of protein sequences seem more frequently identified in the literature as belonging to an epitope. For instance, there appear to be epitope \"hot spots\" around position 250 for 2ZB6, around the positions 140, 150 and 220 for 1AG2 and at the positions around 60 and 150 for 3BLG.

Each bar is then split vertically according to the amino acid values for accessibility. index demonstrates a nice correlation for the 2ZB6 structure. Unfortunately, this site also corresponds to an unresolved gap in the 3D structure between positions 239 and 247.

In order to evaluate the average level of exposure for a given epitope, a generic approach has been applied to a set of diverse antigens for which epitopes have been experimentally identified and collected from the IEDB database. This approach involves comparing the accessibility values of epitope residues to the remaining elements of the molecules. Two numeric values have been calculated: the RSA, representing the residue accessibility in terms of exposed surface, and the PI, representing its distance from the overall shape of the proteins. Comparing the RSA and PI results, the distributions of amino acids into classes of values or protein surface profiles are similar. More precisely, it appears that the amino acids within epitopes are not distributed above any threshold for either RSA or PI values. Moreover, they cannot be classified into any specific range of accessibility values, since the epitope distribution is equivalent to any other fragment of the structures. These observations suggest that this approach could not be used to help describe potential epitopes or to locate unknown epitopes.",

Therefore, surface ratio values have been preferred to exposure percentages, because terminal amino acids often display higher values. Some residues have a value greater than 1 when they occur in sharp turns, when they have unusual conformations or when they are chain termini with free amino or carboxylate groups.

Assuming that the experimental protocols vary in their precision level, reported con- tinuous epitopes may also include some discontinuous epitope pieces. Epitope sequences longer than 20 amino acids have been removed from our analysis as being less informative and therefore less precise estimates of epitope localisation. The precision level is a stronger consideration for immunotherapy or vaccine developments than for the development or implementation of diagnostic tools. Consequently, this gives rise to a multiplicity of identification techniques, as illustrated in our epitope dataset by more than 30 different assay types (and more may be referred to in IEDB). Sometimes the same technique yields different results. As an example, epitope mapping of a midge allergen (Chi t 1.01) by immunoassays with different synthetic peptide lengths has localised epitopes to different areas (van Kampen et al., 2001) . It has already been noted that uncontrolled events appear throughout the binding assays and may generate partially misleading results (Albrecht et al., 2009; Van Regenmortel, 2006) . Some of the molecules used for immunisation have become denatured before or after being injected into the animal or may become denatured by adsorption to plastic when used in solid phase immunoassays. Fragments of the native protein may then cross react with antibodies. Likewise, an antibody will not recognise a peptide in the same manner when it is free in solution or adsorbed onto a solid phase.",

It is tempting to associate the number of covered antigen sequences and the number of identified epitopes of each type.

The identification of discontinuous epitopes often comes from the interaction of a monoclonal antibody with the antigen, which represents only one potential interaction among a mass of others. The limited number of known discontinuous epitopes or of Ab-Ag complex structures could partly explain the poor performance of current prediction tools obtained from Ponomarenko and Bourne's benchmark (2007) . In contrast, the identification of continuous epitopes requires less expensive methods and are therefore more frequently used, resulting in an increase in the number of continuous epitopes identified. By extension, the sequences covered could reflect the antibody diversity coming from different pools of sera used by the different research teams. No distinctions between major vs minor epitopes have been introduced in the present work. Such distinctions would imply an epitope hierarchy, which does not lend itself to a generic treatment of the dataset.
