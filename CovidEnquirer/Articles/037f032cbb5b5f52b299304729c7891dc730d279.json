The test is based on the detection of antibodies against the Salmonella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigen; flagellar H antigen is more indicative of past and current Salmonella infection and not the carrier state. 12 The PCR for typhoid has yielded a sensitivity of >90% using nested primers, but on other hand the DNA from uncultured and dead bacteria can also be amplified by PCR, therefore colony-forming units cannot be specifically correlated with the PCR diagnosis. Moreover molecular methods for the detection of S. typhi are very technically demanding. 13 Proteomics-based methods are currently being employed to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of enteric fever and to explore the peripheral signatures of enteric fever. 13 The molecular signature can be of host or bacterial origin, or a combination of both, produced during the process of infection. 13 Biomarkers for intracellular pathogens, such as tuberculosis, have been developed using proteomics and mass spectrometry. 14, 15 The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) protein biomarker has been identified using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF). 15 The present study was conducted to investigate the expression of differentially expressed proteins in asymptomatic chronic typhoid carriers, acute typhoid cases, and healthy controls. Two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry techniques were used to identify newer proteins that may provide an insight into the host-pathogen interactions after Salmonella infection and in further colonization of the host leading to the chronic typhoid carrier state. A transcriptomics-based analysis was further conducted to correlate the changes occurring at the mRNA level translated exponentially at the protein level. The results of the present study will provide a better understanding and insight into the mechanism of the pathogenesis of Salmonella and allow the development of better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to enteric fever.",

Each set of experiments was reproduced twice and the data analyzed by ImageMaster 2D Platinum software. Figure 1 shows the complete resolution of the proteins on 2D gels. A percentage volume change of spots for the typhoid groups greater than two-fold that of the controls was taken into consideration. The expression of four protein spots was found to be significantly upregulated in chronic typhoid carriers as compared to controls and acute typhoid cases, however very little change was observed between the expression of the four spots in acute typhoid cases as compared to controls. Further, the differences in expression of all four spots showed a significant upregulation in cases of chronic typhoid carriers as compared to acute typhoid cases (Figure 2 ). Mass spectrometric analysis using MALDI-TOF and LC-MS identified these proteins as proprotein convertase subtilisin, furin, haptoglobin, and albumin ( Figure 2 ). MALDI mass spectra and the probability plot corresponding to proprotein convertase subtilisin, furin, haptoglobin, and albumin, provided m/z values for each protein; these were used to search proteins in the available protein database. With regard to the ion score (\u00c010*log (p), where p is the probability and the observed match was random), protein scores greater than 33 for proprotein convertase subtilisin, furin, and haptoglobin, and greater than 34 for albumin, were considered significant (p < 0.05). The probability-based MOWSE score obtained for albumin was 157 (p < 0.05); the score was 143 for haptoglobin, 58 for furin, and 38 for proprotein convertase subtilisin. Details of the peptide summary report are given in Table 4 , as per the minimum information about proteomics experiment (MIAPE) standard.",

            "text": "The exploitation of host furin in the activation of bacterial toxin, allowing entry into the host cell, has also been well reported. 48 Proteolytic processing by furin is an important determinant of pathogenicity for viruses and bacterial toxins. 34 The presence of furin in the trans-Golgi network requires a minimum recognition motif for the optimal processing of various bacterial and viral endotoxins in the disease pathogenesis. 34 The cell-specific type expression of furin is not clear; T-cells predominantly express furin, which activates T-cell-activated genes that modulate an important immunosuppressive cytokine. 48 The increase in furin expression in our study might have some role in the induction of immunosuppressive cytokines. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) upregulates the expression of the fur gene, which in turn increases pro-TGFb1 maturation. 35 The roles of proprotein convertase subtilisin and furin in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMP), which are involved in extracellular matrix degradation, are known. 33 An increase in TGF-b upregulates the activity of MT-MMPs, and their involvement in different types of cancer is well established. 33 A large cohort study of a typhoid outbreak in 1964 showed a markedly increased risk of gall bladder cancer in chronic carriersas high as 167 times that of non-carriers. 35 The expression of MT-MMP in the stromal component may be essential for the malignant potential of gall bladder cancer. 36 The increase in furin and proprotein convertase subtilisin indicates that after infection with Salmonella, these proteins may induce the expression of MT-MMPs, which play an important role in cancer invasiveness in gall bladder cancer. 37 Typhoid fever can cause anemia by a variety of mechanisms. 38 In acute infection or hepatic dysfunction, there is usually very little change in serum albumin levels, because albumin has a long biological half-life. 39, 40 The level of albumin was upregulated in chronic typhoid cases in our study, and this might be due to an increase in free radicals during Salmonella infection; the release of hydroxyl radicals and nitric oxide in cases of Salmonella has already been reported. 41, 42 The increase in albumin found mainly in chronic typhoid carriers in the current study might occur in order to counteract the generation of free radicals, because albumin is known to have antioxidant properties during free radical generation in the case of infection. [43] [44] [45] The antagonistic effect of haptoglobin on endotoxin was first demonstrated by Baseler and Burrell. 46 The effect of haptoglobin on endotoxin-induced cytokine release is not yet known. 47 However, it is evident from past research that haptoglobin enters monocytes and neutrophils and interrupts the intracellular function triggered by intracellular LPS. 47 The role of haptoglobin in the modulation of proinflammatory cytokines and antiinflammatory cytokines is debatable and needs further investigation. 47 The present study showed an increase in haptoglobin, which is an acute phase protein, in chronic typhoid carriers, and this might have a significant role in triggering the intracellular signaling of monocytes and neutrophils during typhoid carriage. The role of haptoglobin as a modulator of inflammation in pathological conditions such as respiratory infections and endotoxic shock is already known. 47 Thus, increased levels of haptoglobin during typhoid carriage provide the environment for S. typhi to modulate the release of cytokines during infection and to sustain its survival in the host. The data from the present study clearly indicate the role of the proteins identified in chronic typhoid carriers, which have a potential effect in perturbing the host inflammatory response triggered by S. typhi during its carriage. Further, the role of these proteins in the intracellular cell signaling of monocytes in chronic typhoid carriers needs further investigation in order to understand the mechanism of the host-pathogen interaction and to develop diagnostic kits and therapeutic drug targets. vs. chronic typhoid carriers, and ## p < 0.01 for acute typhoid cases vs. chronic typhoid carriers in the case of proprotein convertase subtilisin; *p < 0.05 for controls vs. chronic typhoid carriers, and # p < 0.05 for acute typhoid cases vs. chronic typhoid carriers in the case of furin; **p < 0.01 for controls vs. chronic typhoid carriers, and ## p < 0.01 for acute typhoid cases vs. chronic typhoid carriers in the case of haptoglobin; **p < 0.01 for controls vs. chronic typhoid carriers, and ## p < 0.01 for acute typhoid cases vs. chronic typhoid carriers in the case of albumin.",
