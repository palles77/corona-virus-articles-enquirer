Major advances have been made in identifying RIG-I ligands, but our knowledge of the ligands for MDA5 remains restricted to data from transfection experiments mostly using poly(I:C), a synthetic dsRNA mimic. Here, we dissected the IFN-a/b-stimulatory activity of different viral RNA species produced during picornavirus infection, both by RNA transfection and in infected cells in which specific steps of viral RNA replication were inhibited. Our results show that the incoming genomic plus-strand RNA does not activate MDA5, but minus-strand RNA synthesis and production of the 7.5 kbp replicative form trigger a strong IFN-a/b response. IFN-a/b production does not rely on plus-strand RNA synthesis and thus generation of the partially doublestranded replicative intermediate. This study reports MDA5 activation by a natural RNA ligand under physiological conditions.",

RIG-I can be activated by 5 0 -triphosphate (ppp)-containing RNAs as well as short (<2 kbp) dsRNAs (Kato et al., 2011) . The ligand specificity of RIG-I provides an explanation for how it differentiates viral RNAs from cellular RNAs. Many RNA viruses carry genomes that contain 5 0 ppp or produce 5 0 ppp-containing RNAs during their replication cycle in the cytoplasm of infected cells, whereas cytoplasmic cellular RNAs generally lack 5 0 ppp. The ligands of MDA5 are as yet poorly defined. MDA5 is activated by transfection of a long (>2 kbp), synthetic dsRNA analog of artificial sequence, namely polyinosinic:polycytidylic [poly(I:C)]. Additionally, transfection-based experiments showed that the L segments of the reovirus genome ($3.9 kbp dsRNAs) induce an IFN-b response that is partially dependent on MDA5 (Kato et al., 2006) . Based on these findings, it is believed that MDA5 recognizes long dsRNAs, which would be intrinsically ''nonself.'' However, little is known about the identities and characteristics of physiological ligands of MDA5 in infected cells.",

            "text": "Many (+)RNA viruses, including picornaviruses, produce dsRNAs during infection. Picornaviridae is a large, highly diverse family of human and animal viruses, including many pathogens of great medical and/or economical significance. The picornavirus genome is a 7.5-8.5 kb ssRNA molecule that harbors a single open reading frame flanked by structured 5 0 and 3 0 nontranslated regions and a poly(A) tail at the 3 0 end. The 5 0 terminus contains a small (20-24 aa) viral peptide, VPg, linked via an unusual tyrosine-RNA phosphodiester bond. Upon virus entry and uncoating, the virion RNA (vRNA) is released into the cytoplasm where it is directly translated. Viral RNA templates used for protein synthesis no longer contain VPg due to the activity of a yet unknown cellular enzyme (further referred to as unlinkase) (Rozovics et al., 2011) . The viral polyprotein is proteolytically processed to release the viral proteins that engage in genomic RNA replication. During this complex process, several species of viral RNAs with unique features are generated ( Figure 2A) . First, the viral genomic ssRNA is transcribed into a complementary (\u00c0)RNA by the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using VPg as primer, yielding a 7.5 kbp dsRNA named the replicative form (RF). The (\u00c0)RNA is subsequently used as a template for VPg-primed synthesis of large amounts of new (+)RNAs, which are identical to vRNA. Newly synthesized (+) RNAs either enter a new cycle of translation and RNA replication or are encapsidated to form new virion particles. During the process of (+)RNA synthesis, a partially ds replicative intermediate (RI)-consisting of multiple incomplete (+)RNAs undergoing active transcription along the full-length (\u00c0)RNA-is formed.",

Here, we set out to investigate the role of RLRs in the recognition of representative picornaviruses from various genera using wild-type (WT) and RIG-I \u00c0/\u00c0 , MDA5 \u00c0/\u00c0 , or MAVS \u00c0/\u00c0 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). To bypass the requirement for specific entry receptors, we introduced vRNAs into the cytoplasm by transfection rather than infection. Figure 1A shows IFN-b responses in WT and knockout MEFs triggered by transfection of vRNA of WT mengovirus (a strain of EMCV) or infection of a mutant mengovirus (mengo-Zn). This virus generates high levels of IFN-b because its IFN antagonist has been compromised (Hato et al., 2007) . Both methods resulted in a MDA5and MAVS-dependent, but RIG-I-independent, IFN-b induction, demonstrating the suitability of the transfection method to identify the RLR(s) responsible for detecting picornaviruses.",

These newly synthesized (+)RNAs could serve as template to make additional RFs in the DIP-treated cells, but not in the CHX-treated cells, and result in the increase of IFN-b induction observed at 3 hr p.i.

Furthermore, the RF contains a large unpaired poly(A) tail at the 3 0 end of the (+)RNA (van Ooij et al., 2006) . To investigate whether these features are important for MDA5 activation, we produced CVB3 and mengovirus dsRNAs with 5 0 ppp and perfectly paired termini by in vitro transcription (ivt dsRNA) and compared them with viral RF purified from infected cells for their ability to activate MDA5. Strikingly, all dsRNAs triggered a similar IFN-b response upon transfection into RIG-I \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs ( Figure 5F ). Additionally, CVB3 ivt dsRNA activated MDA5 to a similar extent as CVB3 RF in our in vitro ATPase assay ( Figure 3F) .

Furthermore, a virally encoded peptide, VPg, is covalently attached to the 5 0 terminus of picornavirus RNAs via a unique tyrosine-RNA bond, providing a potential ''nonself'' signature at the 5 0 end.

Here, we provide experimental evidence that purified picornavirus RF can not only induce an MDA5-dependent IFN-a/b response upon transfection, but also directly bind to, and activate, MDA5 in vitro. Viral ssRNAs, on the other hand, proved poor MDA5 stimuli. Neither vRNA (VPg-containing) nor viral mRNA (VPg-lacking) induced an IFN-b response when transfected into cells. This is in line with the observation that the full-length EMCV RNA failed to activate MDA5 ATPase activity in vitro (Peisley et al., 2011) . Although we could not test IFN-stimulatory activity of purified RI, this molecule does not seem to play a crucial role in inducing IFN-a/b because treatment of the CVB3 ssRNA fraction with RNase A did not affect its ability to induce IFN-a/b. This observation also speaks against the hypothesis that other (viral) ssRNAs-which might have been produced by the action of cellular RNases like RNaseL-may be recognized by MDA5. Collectively, our transfection experiments clearly identify the RF as an MDA5 agonist. Previously, Pichlmair and colleagues identified two virus-induced RNA species in their total RNA extract from EMCV-infected cells: one dsRNA of approximately 12 kbp and one high-molecular-weight RNA (HMW-RNA) that consisted of both ssRNAs and dsRNAs (Pichlmair et al., 2009 ). The HMW-RNA, but not the 12 kbp dsRNA, was found to be IFN-a/b stimulatory upon transfection. We never observed either of these RNAs in our total RNA extracts or the fractionated RNA preparations. The identity of the HMW-RNA and the IFNstimulatory element(s) within their mixed RNA population remains unclear.",

First, transfection delivers large amounts of viral RNA directly into the cytoplasm at once. This is different from the RNA release process during infectious entry as well as the gradual accumulation of viral RNAs during virus replication. Second, purified, and therefore ''naked,'' RNAs are transfected into cells whereas viral RNAs are heavily coated with viral and host factors during infection. Third, (+)RNA viruses induce the formation of membranous replication organelles, which may restrict access of MDA5 to replication intermediates such as RF and RI. To gain insight into MDA5 activation in a more physiologically relevant situation, we studied MDA5 activation in infected cells. Our data show that the incoming genomic ssRNA alone cannot induce any detectable IFN-b response even when large amounts were delivered by high MOI infection. When (\u00c0)RNA synthesis (i.e., formation of RF) was permitted but (+)RNA synthesis (i.e., formation of RI) was inhibited, a significant upregulation of IFN-b mRNA was observed. These data further support the idea that picornavirus RF is the essential MDA5 agonist in the course of infection. Of note, a much higher IFN-b response was observed when RNA replication was allowed to proceed fully (i.e., in the absence of inhibitor). Although this finding may be interpreted as that RIs also activate MDA5, this increase can be attributed, at least partly, to the increased amount of RF produced from newly synthesized (+)RNAs that enter new rounds of RNA replication.",

Changing the physiological terminal groups of RF into 5 0 ppp and fully complemented 3 0 end did not change its ability to induce IFN-b upregulation. Other features such as secondary structures are common requirements for ligand recognition; however, the picornavirus RF is not known to contain distinct higher structures. Thus, it is likely that the long ds nature of the RF, and not its unique termini, renders this RNA a potent MDA5 activator.",

We tested dsRNAs of viral sequence in vitro that span a wide range of sizes (0.1-7.4 kbp), and found that although longer dsRNAs activate MDA5 more efficiently when provided at equal mass, short dsRNAs could also induce some levels of MDA5 activation when present in large quantities. These data suggest that MDA5 may not require its substrate to be longer than a strict cut-off size. In line with this, others have demonstrated efficient activation of MDA5 ATPase activity by dsRNAs as short as 112 bp (Peisley et al., 2011) . Authors of this paper also showed that MDA5 ATPase activity, which is triggered by ligand binding, induces disassembly of MDA5 from the RNA ligand, the rate of which is inversely related to the length of the bound RNA molecule (Peisley et al., 2011) . This provides some molecular explanation why longer dsRNAs are more efficient in activating MDA5 than shorter ones.",
