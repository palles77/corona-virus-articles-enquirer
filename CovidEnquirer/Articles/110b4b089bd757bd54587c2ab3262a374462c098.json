Active transport requires 40 metabolic energy to passage molecules across the plasma membrane in the direction 41 against the concentration gradient, whereas passive transport moves molecules down its 42 concentration without needing an energy input, which can be further classified as 43 facilitated diffusion and free diffusion, respectively. Active transport and facilitated 44 diffusion are dependent on the specific molecular binding between cargo and transporter, 45 thereby exhibiting stereospecificity, transport saturation, and competitive inhibition 46 (Cirillo, 1961) . Moreover, numerous sugars are taken up with concomitant 47 phosphorylation via the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): carbohydrate phosphotransferase 48 system (PTS), which may cause carbon catabolite repression (CCR), leading to a diauxic 49 cell growth (St\u00fclke & Hillen, 1999) .

In contrast, free diffusion is a non-mediated transport 52 with a linear rate in proportion to the concentration difference.

In bacteria, this channel is 60 formed by the SecY complex (SecYEG) and is located in the plasma membrane 61 (Brundage et al, 1990; Akimaru et al, 1991; Breyton et al, 2002) . The X-ray crystal 62 structure revealed that the SecY channel has an hourglass shape with a narrow central 63 constriction consisting of six hydrophobic amino acid residues termed the pore ring, and (Kornberg et al, 2000) , these 74 findings prompted us to hypothesize that whether the SecY channel can be designed as a 75 free diffusion passageway for efficient transport of carbohydrates, thus developing an 76 entirely novel paradigm for sugar passage and addressing the problems encountered with 77 the specific transporters. In the present work, we engineered the SecY channel by plug 78 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

In contrast, the limited growth on glucose 91 caused by insufficient import of the sole carbon source was partially rescued. We 92 reasoned that the SecY (\u0394P) channel might allow glucose to diffuse through the plasma 93 membrane due to its small V A (\u2248 0.178 m 3 /kmol) and large diffusion coefficient (D AB \u2248 94 1.009\u00d710 -9 m 2 /s) in water (Appendix Table S1 ), which was confirmed by a [ 14 C]-labelled 95 glucose transport assay (Fig 2C) . With the purpose of further enhancing the glucose 96 uptake, SCVE was co-expressed with the SecY (\u0394P) channel (Fig 2A and B) . The SCVE 97 has the ability to permeabilize the outer membrane of E. coli by formation of the 98 transmembrane pores as porins (Liao et al, 2004) . The reduced permeation barrier of the 99 outer membrane might increase the glucose gradient across the SecY (\u0394P) channel, thus 100 accelerating the glucose diffusion into the cytoplasm ( Fig 2C) and resulting in a marked 101 All rights reserved.

The SecY channel is structurally conserved in prokaryotes, thus it may 28 be engineered to serve as a unique and universal transporter for bacteria to passage sugars 29 as demonstrated in Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum. Introduction 34 Synthetic biology aims to design and build biological systems to reprogram organisms 35 or even create artificial life (Smanski et al, 2016; Ausl\u00e4nder et al, 2017). Sugars are the 36 major carbon and energy sources for living cells, thus transport of sugars across the 37 plasma membrane into the cytoplasm is an essential cell physiological function, which 38 relies on the sugar-specific transport systems involving active and passive mechanisms 39",

The SecY plug domain serves as a physical 66 barrier that ensures the channel is sealed in its resting state (Li et al, 2007). During 67 protein translocation, the plug is displaced away from the center of the channel toward 68 the open position by the incoming polypeptide (Tam et al, 2005; Li et al, 2016), and the 69 pore ring forms a 'gasket-like' seal around the polypeptide chain (Park & Rapoport, 70 2011), preventing the permeation of other molecules. 71 Given the widespread interests in sugar transporters in basic biology research and 72 biotechnology application (Galazka et al, 2010; Luo et al, 2014), as well as the 73 challenges surrounding their broad substrate profiles",

We compared the Monod growth kinetic parameters of the E. coli (\u0394PtsG) co-109 expressing SecY (\u0394P), SCVE and Glk with those of the wild-type strain (Fig 2F). Both 110 strains had a maximum specific growth rate (\u03bc max ) of 0.347 h -1 , but the half-saturation 111 constant (K S ) of the mutant strain (\u2248 4.803 mM) was 1.49-fold that of the wild-type E. 112 coli (\u2248 3.234 mM). 113 Then, we selected fructose and mannose as two other models of the PTS-dependent 114 hexoses. E. coli with damaged fructose PTS (\u0394FruA) (Ferenci & Kornberg, 1974) or 115 mannose PTS (\u0394ManXYZ) (Erni & Zanolari, 1985) did not grow on fructose (Fig 3A and 116 B) or mannose (Fig 3D and E), respectively. On the other hand, SecY (\u0394P) and SCVE 117 were found to help both mutant strains to recover cell growth, especially for the one 118 grown on mannose. By co-expression of an E. coli fructo(manno)kinase (Mak) which 119 catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose or mannose in the cytoplasm (Sproul et al, 120 2001), the strain lacking FruA grew on fructose at a similar rate to that of the wild-type 121 E. coli",

Also, as in the case of glucose, the SecY (\u0394P) 132 channel exhibited a higher half-saturation constant for fructose (K S \u2248 1.579 mM) and 133 mannose (K S \u2248 4.719 mM) than the fructose PTS (K S \u2248 0.843 mM) and the mannose PTS 134 (K S \u2248 3.181 mM), respectively. 135 Functional transport of the non-PTS-dependent pentoses via SecY (\u0394P) channel 136 Next, we tested xylose and arabinose, which are non-PTS-dependent pentoses. The 137 main transporters for xylose (XylFGH) (Sumiya et al, 1995) and arabinose (AraFGH, 138 AraE) (Schleif, 2000) in E. coli were deleted independently, thus the obtained strains 139 either did not grow on xylose (Fig 3G and H) or arabinose (Fig 3J and K) as the sole 140 carbon source. As expected, co-expression of SecY (\u0394P) and SCVE fully supported the 141 growth of the mutants. The lag phases of both mutant strains were obviously shortened 142",

The LacY transporter (Abramson et al, 2003) was deleted from E. 162 coli, thus the obtained strain could not grow on lactose as the sole carbon source (Fig 163 4A).

More 179 seriously, an excessively high sugar gradient across the cell membrane may force the cell 180 to lose water, causing significant growth inhibition. As shown in Fig 5A-C, the specific 181 growth rates of E. coli at 50, 100, and 150 g/L of glucose were 0.137, 0.127, and 0.026 h -182 1 , while the rates of the E. coli (\u0394PtsG) with SecY (\u0394P), SCVE and Glk were 0.175, 183 0.228, and 0.184 h -1 , respectively. It indicates that use of the SecY (\u0394P) channel was able 184 to improve the cell growth at high sugar levels. Similarly, Clostridium acetobutylicum, a 185 Gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium, was found to grow faster when the SecY (\u0394P) 186 channel was employed for xylose transport rather than using the native XylT at 70 g/L of 187 xylose (Fig 5D). The specific growth rate increased by over 18%, from 0.364 h -1 to 0.431 188 h -1 . Moreover, Fig 5E and F suggest that the SecY (\u0394P) channel was able to reduce the 189 competitive inhibition caused by the glucose analogs, methyl-\u03b1-D-glucoside (\u03b1-MG) and 190 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), on transport of glucose in E. coli. Thereafter, simultaneous 191 utilization of mixed monosaccharides by the channel-engineered E. coli was tested. As 192 expected, the wild-type E. coli exhibited CCR when grown in the presence of glucose al, 2015) (Fig 5H). Our results show that replacing the glucose PTS with SecY (\u0394P), 197 SCVE and Glk in E. coli enabled the cells to simultaneously utilize glucose and xylose 198 (Fig 5I), overcoming the CCR phenomenon, and the consumption rates of both sugars 199 were accelerated as compared to the non-channel-engineered E. coli (\u0394PtsG)used in this study were E. coli Top10 and E. coli BL21 (DE3), which have 205 the genotypes: F -mcrA \u0394(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) \u03c680 lacZ\u0394M15 \u0394lacX74 recA1 206 ara\u0394139 \u0394(ara-leu)7697 galU galK rpsL(Str R ) endA1 nupG, and F -ompT hsdS(r dcm (DE3), respectively.
