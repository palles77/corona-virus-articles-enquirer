In this study, a TGEV JS2012 strain was isolated from the feces of piglets in Jiangsu Province, China. The phylogenetic analysis showed that TGEV JS2012 was placed between the Purdue and the Miller clusters. Analysis of recombination confirmed that TGEV JS2012 is a natural recombinant strain between Miller M6 and Purdue 115. Similar to Miller M6, virulent Purdue and China strain TS, in S gene the JS2012 maintained genetic integrity and the characteristics of the TGEV virulent strains. In vivo, TGEV JS2012 caused 100% mortality in newborn piglets, indicating the strong pathogenicity of this isolate. These results reveal that the JS2012 is a novel natural recombinant TGEV with high virulence. Our findings provide valuable information about genetic diversity and infection mechanism of the coronavirus family.",

Since then, outbreaks of the disease have been reported in many swine-producing countries, including England, Japan, China, Belgium, Africa and Australia (Kemeny and Woods, 1977; Pritchard, 1987; Wood et al., 1981) . It causes viral enteritis and severe diarrhea with high morbidity in pigs of all ages, especially fetal diarrhea in neonates, leading to high mortality in suckling piglets (Enjuanes et al., 1995) . TGEV causes significant economic losses at swine-raising farms (Enjuanes et al., 1995; Wesley et al., 1991) . There have been many recent reports of TGEV infection in China (Hou et al., 2012; Li et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2017) . Epidemiological investigations have shown that TGEV is often present in mixed infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) Zhang et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2017) .",

Both viruses belong to the family Coronaviridae and genus Alphacoronavirus. The genomic sequence length of TGEV is about 28.5 kb (Vaughn et al., 1995) . The genome contains nine open reading frames (ORFs) encoding four traditional coronavirus structural proteins: receptor-binding spike glycoprotein (S); envelope protein (E); membrane glycoprotein (M); nucleocapsid protein (N); and five nonstructural proteins (replicase 1a and 1b, 3a, 3b, and protein 7) in the order 5\u2032-replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab)-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032 (Enjuanes et al., 2008) . The spike (S) gene of TGEV is about 4.3 kb in length. It encodes a protein of 1450 amino acids (aa), composed of S1 and S2 external domains, transmembrane domain, Cterminal cytoplasmic domain, and signal peptide. Four major antigenic sites, A-D, have been characterized at the N terminus of S protein (Delmas et al., 1990) . The S protein plays a role in virulence, growth adaptation, receptor binding, and virus-cell membrane fusion (Ballesteros et al., 1997; Collins et al., 1982; Jimenez et al., 1986; Krempl et al., 1997; Sanchez et al., 1999; Xiao et al., 2008) .

ORF3 consists of ORF3a and ORF3b. Deletions in ORF3a are found in many TGEV strains and respiratory coronaviruses (Kim et al., 2000; McGoldrick et al., 1999) . Previous studies have suggested the gene 3 play a potential role in virulence of swine enteric TGEV and respiratory coronaviruses (Paul et al., 1997) . Although some studies have suggested that ORF3a is not essential for virulence (McGoldrick et al., 1999; Sola et al., 2003) .",

In recent years, mixed infections have occurred frequently with TGEV and PEDV Zhang et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2017) . In the present study, TGEV JS2012 strain was obtained from a farm with a diarrhea outbreak, in which TGEV and PEDV co-infection was detected by RT-PCR. Experimental infection indicated that the piglets had severe diarrhea with vomiting after TGEV JS2012 infection. Both infections cause destruction of villous enterocytes and villous atrophy in the jejunum and ileum (Kim and Chae, 2001; Madson et al., 2016) . In TGEV JS2012 infection, viral nucleic acid was detected as early as 12 h after inoculation, as described previously (Kim and Chae, 2002) . Piglets showed characteristic clinical symptoms at 12 h after inoculation and anal swab detection was positive, which indicated that virus had colonized the small intestine 12 h after challenge. This phenomenon was similar to recent infections with virulent PEDV strains (Fan et al., 2017a; Lin et al., 2015; Madson et al., 2016) . The significant differences showed that virus-positive cells are present in villous epithelial cells as well as the jejunal crypt enterocytes.",

This classification indicates significant genetic diversity within TGEV strains. The traditional TGEV group could be further divided into two subgroups: Miller and Purdue. The phylogenetic analysis based on the genome demonstrated that JS2012 was clustered into the Miller subgroup. However, in the phylogenetic trees based on the S gene, TGEV JS2012 belonged to the Purdue subgroup. The recombinant analysis showed TGEV JS2012 is a recombinant virus between Miller M6 and Purdue P115. Purdue strain group viruses with high homology to attenuated strain Purdue 115, such as TGEV SHXB, HX, WH-1 and AYU are also prevalent in China, which providing increased opportunities for reorganization. The recombination breakpoints of TGEV JS2012 was located at the end of the S gene. The binding site of host cell receptor aminopeptide N and four major antigenic sites, A-D, are present at the N terminus of S protein (Delmas et al., 1990; Reguera et al., 2012) , which influences the antigenicity, growth adaptation, receptor binding, and cell membrane fusion of TGEV (Ballesteros et al., 1997; Collins et al., 1982; Jimenez et al., 1986; Krempl et al., 1997; Sanchez et al., 1999; Xiao et al., 2008) . Meanwhile, the results of animal experiments suggest that this recombination does not affect the virulence of the virus.",

The T to G mutation at nt 1753 of the S gene leads to the serine-to-alanine mutation at aa 585, which is located in the main major antigenic sites A/B of the TGEV S protein. This mutation may significantly influence receptor binding or interaction with neutralizing antibody and have a significant effect on antigenicity, which is also considered to be a sign of attenuation (Li et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2007) . A 6-nt deletion is considered to play a role in viral attenuation (Penzes et al., 2001) . There was no deletion or mutation in the S gene of JS2012. This predicted that JS2012 retained the genetic characteristics of the TGEV virulent strain and integrity of the S gene, and suggested that JS2012 was a virulent strain, which was further confirmed by the high pathogenicity in piglets in this study. Although there were 3 other amino acid mutations in S protein of JS2012, they were not located within the four major antigenic sites, regions A-D.
