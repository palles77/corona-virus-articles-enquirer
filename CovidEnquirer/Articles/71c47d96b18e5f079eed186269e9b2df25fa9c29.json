            "text": "Objectives: Though respiratory viruses are thought to cause substantial morbidity globally in children aged <5 years, the incidence of severe respiratory virus infections in children is unknown in India where 20% of the world's children live. Methods: During August 2009eJuly 2011, prospective population-based surveillance was conducted for hospitalizations of children aged <5 years in a rural community in Haryana State. Clinical data and respiratory specimens were collected. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR for influenza and parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, and adenovirus. Average annual hospitalization incidence was calculated using census data and adjusted for hospitalizations reported to occur at non-study hospitals according to a comunity healthcare utilization survey. Results: Of 245 hospitalized children, respiratory viruses were detected among 98 (40%), of whom 92 (94%) had fever or respiratory symptoms. RSV accounted for the highest virusassociated hospitalization incidence (34.6/10,000, 95% CI 26.3e44.7) and 20% of hospitalizations. There were 11.8/10,000 (95% CI 7.9e18.4) influenza-associated hospitalizations (7% of hospitalizations). RSV and influenza virus detection peaked in winter (NovembereFebruary) and rainy seasons (July), respectively. Conclusion: Respiratory viruses were associated with a substantial proportion of Journal of Infection (2014) 68, 281e289 hospitalizations among young children in a rural Indian community. Public health research and prevention in India should consider targeting RSV and influenza in young children. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The British Infection Association.",

However, the burden of respiratory virus-associated severe illness among young children in India is unknown. In addition, the few studies that evaluated respiratory viral etiologies of severe illness among children in India were conducted before the advent of newer and more sensitive diagnostic tests, including tests to detect more recently discovered viruses. 17e20 Using data from population-based surveillance of approximately 9500 children for hospitalizations for acute medical illness in rural northern India and concomitant testing for respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), we estimate the incidence of respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations among children aged <5 years.

            "text": "Based on surveillance of approximately 9500 children, this study is the first prospective, population-based study to measure the incidence of respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations among children aged <5 years in rural India. We found that respiratory virus infections were associated with 40% of acute medical illness hospitalizations among children aged <5 years, and one in five children hospitalized for acute medical illness had RSV infection. Consistent with prior studies, we also found that virus-associated hospitalization rates were highest among children aged <1 year. RSV was the predominant virus identified among children aged <1 year. Among children aged 1e4 years, incidence rates of RSV and influenza viruses were similar. RSV and influenza viruses circulated with clearly defined but different seasonality and were infrequently detected among children without fever or respiratory symptoms or signs, similar to prior studies. 9, 10, 30 The incidence of RSV-associated hospitalizations in our study community was substantial, with an incidence of 35 per 10,000 child-years among children aged <5 years and 99 per 10,000 child-years among children aged <1 year. Many studies have reported RSV as the most common respiratory virus resulting in hospitalization in young children, but relatively few have estimated the incidence of RSVassociated hospitalizations. RSV-associated hospitalization rates per 10,000 children ranged from 109 to 274 among children aged <1 year in studies from rural Thailand, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, and the United States; 25e30 among children aged <5 years in Hong Kong and the United States; and 194 and 450 among children aged <5 years without and with HIV infection in South Africa. Our estimates are similar to those of prior studies from the United States, Europe and Asia. Given the high incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization in our study, availability of an effective and accessible RSV vaccine for young children in India would profoundly impact hospitalization rates in this age group. Because the incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization is highest in infants aged <6 months in whom maternal antibody interference with immune responses may make vaccination challenging, RSV vaccination 0.7 (0e3.9) 0.9 (0e5.5) a Adjusted to account for hospitalizations that occurred at non-study facilities based on data from healthcare utilization survey. b Children with co-detection of more than 1 respiratory virus were included in the incidence estimate of each respiratory virus detected. c Among infants aged <6 months, the adjusted incidence of hospitalization for RSV was 136.8 hospitalizations/10,000 (95% CI 91.1e207.6). d Among infants aged <6 months, the adjusted incidence of hospitalization for influenza was 17.8 hospitalizations/10,000 (95% CI 6.3e51.9). of pregnant women has been suggested as another potential vaccination strategy. 27e29 Though licensed RSV vaccines are not currently available, candidate vaccines are under development 15, 16 and data on RSV disease burden will be important for policy decisions about RSV vaccine introduction if a licensed vaccine becomes available.",

            "text": "Although we found that influenza viruses were associated with a lower incidence of hospitalization than RSV among children aged <5 years, influenza-associated hospitalizations accounted for 7% of all acute medical hospitalizations and up to 42% of monthly hospitalizations during peak circulation. A similar population-based study conducted in western India during the same time period as ours found similar influenza-associated hospitalization rates among children aged <1 year and higher rates among children aged 1e4 years. 31 The contribution of influenza to severe respiratory illness among children in India deserves attention because influenza vaccines are not currently recommended and are not widely available in India. Both traditional inactivated influenza vaccines 32e34 and live attenuated influenza vaccines 35e38 have been shown to be effective against influenza in children in high-income countries. Additional studies are needed to further develop the evidence base for policy makers in India to decide whether to support influenza vaccination recommendations for children. These studies should include data on the incidence of severe influenza in other regions of India, the effectiveness of influenza vaccine among Indian children, and the costs of influenza in India. A study of influenza vaccine effectiveness among children aged <5 years in rural India is underway. 39 The timing of respiratory virus circulation varies globally. RSV and influenza viruses circulate during the colder winter months in some but not all temperate countries. However, influenza viruses circulate year-round in some tropical countries and both RSV and influenza virus circulation seems to coincide with increased rainfall in some places. 40, 41 India is a large and geographically diverse country with temperate, sub-tropical and tropical climates. In our study, conducted in a temperate area, we found that RSV and influenza circulated during clearly defined but different periods. Studies from western India suggest that influenza virus circulation is less defined there, with peaks during the rainy season but perennial influenza virus circulation. 20, 31 Additional studies of influenza virus seasonality in other regions of India are needed to determine optimal timing for influenza vaccination and other prevention measures.",

            "text": "The advent of highly sensitive PCR assays for respiratory viruses allows easier detection of a wider array of viruses but also presents the challenge of interpreting positive test results. Prior studies have shown that some respiratory viruses are frequently detected by PCR among children without fever or respiratory symptoms. 9, 10, 30 Respiratory virus detection in these children may reflect acute infection with atypical symptoms or prolonged shedding of virus from a prior infection highlighting the utility of a control group of children without acute illness to aid interpretation of test results. Our study did not have a control group, but the large majority of children with respiratory virus detection had fever or respiratory findings that support the clinical diagnosis of respiratory infection. Our estimates of RSV and influenza-associated hospitalization incidence are supported by prior studies of hospitalized children in which detection of these viruses was rare from control groups comprised of hospitalized children without fever or respiratory symptoms or non-hospitalized children. Though adenoviruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza viruses have all been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of severe illness, our hospitalization incidence estimates for these viruses should be interpreted with more caution as detection of these viruses has varied among control groups in other studies. 9, 10, 30 Several points should be considered when interpreting our findings. First, our study was conducted at primary and secondary level health facilities without capacity to provide mechanical ventilation and intensive care for critically ill children. Thus, we may have missed hospitalizations of children with more severe illness who were directly admitted to tertiary care hospitals outside the study area. Our study community may also have been too small to evaluate the frequency of rare but severe outcomes such as death. Second, although we attempted to collect the discharge diagnosis of all enrolled children, these data were largely absent from the medical record and therefore could not be used to aid interpretation of respiratory virus testing results. Third, we included testing results for only a select group of respiratory viruses previously identified as being associated with a large proportion of respiratory illnesses in children. Therefore, our results reflect the burden of respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations caused by this select group of viruses. We did not include test results for rhinoviruses because interpretation of rhinovirus detection in the absence of a control group is difficult, although rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus in children with respiratory illness in some prior studies. Additionally, we did not conduct testing for coronaviruses other than coronavirus 229E, and may have underestimated the incidence of coronavirus-associated hospitalization in the study community. Lastly, respiratory virus circulation and incidence is known to vary by year. Our study was conducted over a two year period and we present average annual cumulative incidences of virus-associated hospitalization. Additional studies of respiratory virusassociated disease burden during additional years will be useful for comparison with our findings.",

Incidences were then adjusted for missed hospitalizations occurring at non-study facilities by dividing the unadjusted incidence by the proportion of hospitalizations among HDSS area residents occurring at study facilities.Written informed consent was obtained from the parent/ legal guardian of each participant prior to enrollment.The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of the Indian Council of Medical Research and AIIMS. The Human Research Protection Office of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved reliance on the AIIMS IRB in accordance with 45 CFR 46.114. During August 2009eJuly 2011, 245 children aged <5 years were hospitalized with acute medical illness at study hospitals, of whom, 68 (28%) were aged <6 months, 176 Of the 6 children with respiratory virus detection without fever or key respiratory symptoms or signs, 4 had RSV and 2 had adenovirus; all had vomiting and diarrhea.",
