In the 1980s and 1990s, the etiology of NHAP was considered to be similar to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This belief was reflected in CAP guidelines until 2005 when the designation healthcare-associated pneumonia or HCAP was introduced and nursing home residents were included in the HCAP category. Patients in the HCAP group were thought to be at high risk for pneumonia because of multidrug resistant organisms and required empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy much like people with hospital-acquired infection. Subsequent studies of the etiology of NHAP using sophisticated diagnostic testing found limited evidence of resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or resistant gram-negative organisms or atypical organisms. In terms of management of NHAP in the nursing home there are several considerations that are discussed: hospitalization decision, initial oral or parenteral therapy, timing of switch to an oral regimen if parenteral therapy is initially prescribed, duration of therapy with an emphasis on shorter courses, and follow-up during therapy including the use of the \"antibiotic time out\" protocol. The oral and parenteral antibiotic regimens recommended for treatment of NHAP in this report are based on limited information because there are no randomized controlled trials to define the optimum regimen. In conclusion, most residents with pneumonia can be treated successfully in the nursing home. However, there is an urgent need for a specific NHAP diagnosis and treatment guideline that will give providers guidance in the management of this infection in the nursing home.",

The focus is on management in the nursing home because most episodes of NHAP are treated in that setting. 1 In the past 3 decades, there has been an evolution in the view of the etiology of NHAP from one that is similar to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to one in which resistant organisms predominate that has been termed health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP). However, almost all of the studies of etiology of NHAP have been in hospitalized residents and it remains to be determined if these findings are applicable to management in the nursing home. And despite remarkable advancements in nonculture methods for detecting organisms in clinical specimens, there continues to be almost total reliance on culture-based methods to identify an etiologic agent in those suspected of having pneumonia. 2 This report will provide the clinician with information about etiology of NHAP and recommendations for empiric antibiotic therapy in the nursing home.",

            "text": "In 1998, a review of NHAP included an evaluation of 18 studies published between 1978 and 1994 that provided information on etiology. 3 Almost all of these studies utilized sputum cultures to identify etiology. However, the results of sputum cultures differed substantially depending on whether or not strict criteria (>25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes and <10 epithelial cells per 100 power field of undiluted sputum sample) were used to exclude oropharyngeal contamination of the sample. Studies that did not evaluate sputum samples for oropharyngeal contamination identified gramnegative bacilli in 3% to 55% of sputum cultures, whereas in the studies that used strict criteria 0% to 12% of cultures contained gramnegative bacilli. In the studies that utilized strict criteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 4% to 25% of sputum cultures, nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae in 0% to 22%, and Staphylococcus aureus in 1% to 6; atypical organisms were rare, and only 1 study evaluated for viruses. The role of atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma and Chlamydia and viruses could not be determined due to lack of information about these pathogens in the studies available. Thus, the pattern of sputum isolates from residents with pneumonia resembled that found in hospitalized patients with CAP. The results of this review informed, in part, recommendations for treatment of NHAP in the nursing home in CAP treatment guidelines in 2000 and 2003. 4, 5 In 2005, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), in collaboration with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), published an update on the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia. 6 Included in this guideline was a new category referred to as healthcare-associated pneumonia or HCAP. The basis for the HCAP category was the finding that resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were being identified more often in patients from the community with infection and this pattern of isolates was more consistent with those isolated in hospital-acquired pneumonia than CAP. 7e10 The HCAP category consisted of a heterogenous group of community-dwelling patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia (Table 1) . These patients had a common risk factor: frequent or recent contact with the healthcare system and/or recent antibiotic therapy. Inclusion of nursing home residence in the HCAP category was based on 2 studies of residents with severe pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation in whom invasive methods to identify the etiology of pneumonia were utilized. 11, 12 In these residents with presumed severe bacterial pneumonia, there was a high rate of isolation of gram-negative aerobic bacilli and MRSA. For patients with 1 or more HCAP criteria, the guideline recommended empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy consisting of 3 antibiotics (2 antipseudomonal agents and 1 for MRSA) that would also be effective for other potentially multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli such as K pneumoniae and Acinetobacter species. 6 The rationale for recommending this regimen was to make sure a patient received appropriate therapy initially, which was identified as an important predictor of morbidity and mortality. 13, 14 Following publication of the ATS/IDSA guideline, 6 a controversy developed regarding the validity of the concept that patients with pneumonia admitted to the hospital and meeting 1 or more of the HCAP criteria had a high probability of infection because of a resistant organism and required empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Recent publications have reviewed this controversy in detail. 15, 16 The major concern was that such an approach would expose patients unnecessarily to multiple antibiotics and promote further development of resistance as well as other adverse effects such as C difficile infection. These reviews found evidence that the patient groups included in the HCAP category did not accurately identify the presence of resistant organisms, and hospital mortality was not increased in patients in this category after adjustment for age and comorbid disease. 15 In addition, the majority of studies comparing guideline-concordant and -discordant treatment of HCAP did not demonstrate an advantage to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy in terms of hospital mortality. 15, 16 As a result of these findings, the approach shifted from the HCAP categorization that focuses on particular clinical groups to identifying specific risk factors for the presence of resistant organisms that can be applied generally. 17 Several algorithms that incorporate risk factors for resistant organisms were developed and found to perform better than HCAP criteria for identifying these organisms. 17 Many of these models included residence in a nursing home as a risk factor for a resistant organism. Given all this pushback regarding the HCAP category, the updated ATS/IDSA guideline published in 2016 did not include this group and indicated that it would be part of an updated CAP guideline. 18 Since 2005 there have been several studies that provide information regarding the etiology of NHAP (Table 2 ), but none have been done in the United States or Canada. All of the studies listed in Table 2 were done in hospitalized residents and used multiple diagnostic techniques including polymerase chain reaction to identify bacteria and viruses. The size of the study populations was small except for 2 studies. 21, 23 The proportion of cases with an identified etiology varied from 12% to 72%. The most consistent finding was that S pneumoniae was one of the most common identified causes of NHAP in all 7 studies. S aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and P aeruginosa were infrequently identified as a causative agent. Atypical organisms such as C pneumoniae and M pneumoniae as an etiology of NHAP were rare in 2 studies, 21,22 but common in 2 Japanese studies done by the same group of investigators. 19, 20 Methods to detect viruses were used in 4 studies and 3 detected viruses 19, 20, 22 ; influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common viruses identified.",

Although this clinical pathway has not been validated, it provides a reasonable basis for evaluating residents suspected of pneumonia regarding the hospitalization decision.

There was no difference in the rate of hospital transfers or 30-day mortality in those treated parenterally vs orally in the nursing home. In a study of treatment of patients hospitalized with CAP, investigators developed criteria to determine when clinical stability was achieved during parenteral therapy to assist in deciding when switch to an oral regimen was appropriate: improvement in signs/symptoms, afebrile for !16 hours, no acute cardiac or other significant events in the first 2 to 3 days of treatment, and able to take oral medication. 42 If all 4 criteria are met, the patient is considered clinically stable and ready to be switched to an oral regimen. Using these criteria, by day 3 of parenteral therapy in the nursing home, 75% of residents achieved clinical stability and were switched to an oral regimen. 1 Criteria for stability are readily available to nursing home staff as the resident is monitored during the first days of treatment and can be included in an \"antibiotic time-out\" protocol (discussed in a later section) to assist the provider in making the \"switch\" decision.",

As a result, very small doses of penicillin were utilized for 1 to 4 days with excellent results.

Since 2003, the IDSA CAP guideline has been revised twice: 2007 49 and 2019. 50 Neither guideline made any recommendation for the treatment of NHAP in the nursing home. The 2007 guideline recommended that nursing home residents admitted to the hospital with pneumonia be treated according to the 2005 ATS/IDSA guideline as a HCAP, but made no recommendations for treatment in the nursing home. 6 However, the 2019 ATS/IDSA CAP guideline recommended abandoning the HCAP classification and assessing patients for risk factors to determine need for MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage, but made no recommendations for treatment of NHAP in the nursing home. 50 In the nursing home, there are several risk factors to consider that put a resident at risk for pneumonia due to a resistant organism (Table 3) . 51 The most important factors in the nursing home resident are a prior culture positive for a resistant organism, especially in the respiratory tract, and recent antibiotic therapy. Tables 4 and 5 provide recommendations for the treatment of NHAP in the nursing home if there are no risk factors for a resistant organism. Table 4 provides recommendations if the decision is to start with a parenteral regimen followed by a switch to an oral regimen. Table 5 provides recommendations if it is decided to treat with an oral agent. There are several points to emphasize about these recommendations. First, there has been concern about using a macrolide alone because of increasing resistance of pneumococci, but there is little evidence to support the clinical relevance of this resistance. 52 Nevertheless, the authors of the latest CAP guideline did not make a strong recommendation for the routine use of monotherapy with a macrolide for the outpatient treatment of CAP. 50 Second, an oral fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, is no longer considered a first-line agent for treatment of NHAP because of multiple potential adverse effects. 53 Third, it is not necessary to cover for atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma or Chlamydia, although doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone provide that coverage.",

However, some of the oral regimens described in Table 5 for treatment of NHAP have coverage for anaerobes.",

This documentation includes history, signs and symptoms, and suspected diagnosis. In addition, the provider should state the diagnostic studies to be ordered, and the plan of treatment pending work-up results. The problem for the provider is that he or she is often not in the nursing home when a resident has a change in status, and must rely on nursing staff to assess the resident and provide the information with which to base decisions. Nursing staff vary in their ability to carry out the necessary evaluation at the bedside and collect all the appropriate information before calling the provider. To deal with this variability, templates have been developed to assist nursing home staff in the evaluation of residents with a change in status and to prompt them to collect the appropriate information before calling the provider. 58, 59 Although there has been pushback from providers regarding the use of electronic medical records (EMR), the EMR is useful for documentation especially when the provider is not on site or there is a covering provider. The \"thought process\" can be documented in the EMR by the resident's usual provider or by a covering provider in the absence of a face-to-face evaluation. This documentation will be useful for follow-up (discussed in the next section) of the resident as the infection is treated.",

Because of the importance of follow-up, nursing home antibiotic stewardship programs should consider incorporating a \"time-out\" protocol in a follow-up procedure. 60 The \"time-out\" protocol consists of an evaluation of the resident by staff and provider on day 2 to 3 of treatment to assess response to treatment and determine if the regimen should be changed or continued. In addition, at the same time, a determination of the duration of treatment can be made. For example, if clinical stability has been achieved as discussed in a previous section, consideration should be given to complete treatment on day 5. \"Timeout\" decisions should be documented in the medical record. If the resident is responding to therapy, it is not necessary to repeat laboratory tests or a chest radiogram.",

            "text": "There have been no studies of the etiology of NHAP in the nursing home setting, mainly because it is difficult to obtain reliable respiratory specimens for culture in this population and the yield of blood cultures is too low to recommend it routinely. Future research may be able to utilize molecular testing to define the etiology of NHAP, but the practicality of this approach in the \"real world\" setting is unclear given the cost of this testing and the need to have testing done at an off-site laboratory. Given the rarity of identifying the etiology of NHAP in the nursing home setting, treatment is almost always empiric. However, the optimum regimen(s) for the treatment of NHAP (including duration of therapy) in the nursing home has not been defined. For example, is there any additional improvement in outcome with the addition of a macrolide to a beta-lactam or cephalosporin in treatment of NHAP? A concern is the role of resistant organisms such as MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the etiology of NHAP. Clinicians practicing nursing need to be aware of the risk factors for colonization with a resistant organism (Table 3 ) and adjust empiric therapy accordingly. The most important risk factor for colonization with a resistant organism is respiratory colonization with MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa or recent antibiotic therapy. As discussed in a previous section, studies of the duration of treatment of CAP have documented that 3 to 5 days is equivalent to 7 to 10 days of therapy in terms of efficacy. However, these studies have excluded nursing home residents. Therefore, studies of the duration of NHAP in the nursing home setting should be considered, as this might impact on antibiotic resistance levels as well as other adverse events such as C difficile infection.",
