Propranolol and timolol, b 1 / b 2adrenergic receptor antagonists were not effective and the cholinergic receptor antagonist, atropine, was effective in only slightly reducing amylase secretion but not lingual lipase. Differential secretion of the two enzymes was observed for basal and stimulated secretion. Thus, exocytosis may not be the only pathway involved in SP-evoked protein secretion.

It was originally isolated from brain and tissue extracts by von Euler and Gaddam (55) and characterized by Chang and Leeman (8) . SP modulates a variety of biological responses including vasodilation, hypotension, contraction of nonvascular smooth muscle, and secretion from exocrine glands (30, 34) . SP stimulates salivary flow from the rat parotid (29, 56) and submandibular glands (56) . SP also evokes amylase release from isolated parotid cells (29) , parotid slices (36, 40) , guinea pig pancreas (43) , and in vivo from rat parotid gland (56) . In addition, SP stimulates phosphoinositol turnover in the parotid (24, 39) , submandibular (24, 31) , and sublingual glands (24) . Thus there are considerable data on the effects of SP on the pancreas and major salivary glands. However, no studies of the effects of SP on protein secretion from minor salivary glands have been reported. Von Ebner's glands are minor exocrine salivary glands that are embedded in muscle fiber beneath and anterior to the circum-vallate papilla and medial to the foliate furrows in the posterior and pharyngeal portion of the tongue (22, 50) . They contain serous acinar cells that are morphologically similar to those of the parotid gland and exocrine pancreas (9, 22, 28, 50) and are thus a good model system for studying secretion from exocrine glands. These serous glands of the tongue are the sole source of an important digestive enzyme, lingual lipase (21) , as well as amylase (11) (12) (13) 19) . Lingual lipase, which hydrolyzes triacylglycerols to fatty acids and partial acylglycerols in the stomach at an acid pH (18, 20, 21) , is the enzyme responsible for the first step in fat digestion. The optimal pH for enzyme activity by lingual lipase is a broad range from 4.0 to 6.5 (14) . The activity of lingual lipase was not decreased after incubations with pepsin at pH 2-6 for up to 1 h (37). In addition, the secretions of von Ebner's glands bathe the taste buds that are found in the troughs of the circumvallate and foliate papillae, and thus they play a role in the perception of taste (48) . Recently, a putative tastant carrier, MWr\u00c518,000, was found in rat von Ebner's glands and in human von Ebner's gland saliva (3, 27, 42, 49) . standard error, and n is the number of experiments, each using the pooled glands of 8 rats according to the analytical and statistical methods described. Secretion of both enzymes increased with time, p \u00c5 0.0001, secretion of amylase was greater than lingual lipase, p \u00c5 0.0001, and the time courses of the enzymes and the curvature of the curves differed, p \u00c5 0.0102 and p \u00c5 0.0001, respectively.",

Although, when combined with SP, a trend was seen towards inhibition of SP-evoked secretion, there were no statistically significant changes in the time courses of SP-evoked secretion of lingual lipase or amylase in the presence of CP-96,345 (p \u00c5 0.0587 and 0.0671 for lingual lipase and amylase, respectively). CP-96,345 (1 mM ) alone did not significantly stimulate secretion of either enzyme at this concentration. However, with 10 mM CP-96,345 (Fig. 7B) , there was inhibition of SP-evoked secretion. The percentage reduction in lingual lipase secretion was 79. Since SP-analog receptor antagonists did not inhibit SPevoked secretion of lingual lipase or amylase, the effects of antagonists to other receptors were investigated. The effects of SP on major salivary glands involved the phosphoinositol pathway mediated by cholinergic stimulation ( 24 ) . Cholinergic stimulation is the major effector of protein secretion from von Ebner's gland ( 12 ) . Therefore, the cholinergic receptor antagonist, atropine, was used to inhibit any cholinergic responses that could possibly be due to SP. Figure 8 shows the effects on secretion of lingual lipase and amylase elicited by SP after preincubation of minced von Ebner's gland tissue with atropine followed by incubation with SP and atropine. Statistical analyses did not demonstrate a significant effect of atropine on the SP-evoked secretion of lingual lipase. There was no significant difference between atropine and atropine / SP on amylase secretion at the individual time points, however, statistical analysis by repeated measured ANOVA revealed an overall effect ( sum of 30 and 60 min ) of the atropine treatment, p \u00c5 0.0298. Thus, there was some evidence of cholinergic mediation of SP-evoked amylase secretion, but not lingual lipase secretion. Two b-adrenergic receptor antagonists, propranolol ( Fig. 9 ) and timolol ( Fig. 10 ) , having both b 1 and b 2 activities had no significant effect on SP-evoked secretion, nor did they evoke secretion when incubated alone ( data not shown ) . DISCUSSION Our experiments showed that SP stimulated secretion of both lingual lipase and amylase from von Ebner's gland in a doseand time-dependent manner. In addition, recent histochemical studies of rat von Ebner's glands revealed degranulation of acinar cells in response to SP (53) and the presence of SP immunoreactivity in selective cells (38) and neuronal elements (33) . SP-evoked responses are mediated by NK-1 receptors (6, 45) . Receptors for SP have been implicated in the secretory responses of the submandibular (4, 15, 24, 56) , parotid (17, 24, 32, 56) , and sublingual glands (24) , and of the exocrine pancreas (26, 47) . Although most tissues have distinct types of receptors for a variety of tachykinin peptides, there is a lack of specificity among the tachykinin receptors, making it difficult to find specific antagonists (5, 6, 30) .",

Species specificity of the NK-1 receptor was revealed when CP-96,345 was found to be a more potent inhibitor of the human than the rat NK-1 receptor (16) . A minor change in the structure of the receptor could increase the binding of one class of antagonists while decreasing another (16) . A species difference was also observed in the affinity of the nonpeptide NK-1 antagonist, CP-96,345, between rat and guinea pig brains (35) . In addition, in contrast to the rat, SP had no effects on parotid or submandibular secretion in the mouse, but the responses to carbachol and isoproterenol in the mouse were similar to those in the rat (51) . An example of organ specificity was found between rat submandibular glands and the pancreas (52) .

            "text": "Another interesting finding was that there was differential secretion of lingual lipase and amylase in both basal and SP-stimulated secretion. During basal secretion more amylase than lingual lipase was secreted in the first 15 min. Significant differences were found between the curvatures of the lingual lipase and amylase secretion time courses (Fig. 2) . The slope of the amylase time course decreased after 30 min, whereas the slope of the lingual lipase curve remained the same. If exocytosis was the only pathway of secretion, these slopes should have been identical. Similar differences were also seen when the secretion was stimulated by carbachol (12) , isoproterenol (12) , and histamine (10) . The only explanation for these findings is that factors other than exocytosis may be involved in basal or stimulated secretion of these enzymes. These factors include unstimulated or constitutive secretion (7) , and the maturative secretory pathway. This pathway is postulated to exist between the trans-Golgi network and the mature secretory granule and to provide a continuous delivery of protein to the cell surface (54) . It has been suggested that this pathway accounts for differences observed between the patterns of proteins secreted from the exocrine pancreas of conscious hogs when secretion is blocked by atropine as compared to regulated (cholinergic) secretion (54) . It is possible that the constitutive, maturative, or another as yet unknown pathway that operates in addition to exocytosis is responsible for the differential secretion of lingual lipase and amylase. In a recent review article (25) , it was suggested that processes, in addition to exocytosis, for the secretion of digestive enzymes would be important to allow for modulation of the amounts of different enzymes secreted depending upon the content of the food ingested. Whereas, exocytosis allows for the secretion of stored enzymes that have been previously synthesized, other means of secretion could modulate the synthesis and independent, immediate secretion of enzymes needed to digest a meal that required more of a particular enzyme.",
