            "text": "The emerging disease SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus that encodes several unusual RNA-processing enzymes, including non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15), a hexameric endoribonuclease that preferentially cleaves at uridine residues. 1-3 How Nsp15 recognizes and cleaves RNA is not well understood and is the subject of this study. Based on the analysis of RNA products separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis, Nsp15 has been reported to cleave both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the uridine. 1,2 We used several RNAs, including some with nucleotide analogs, and mass spectrometry to determine that Nsp15 cleaves only 3\u2032 of the recognition uridylate, with some cleavage 3\u2032 of cytidylate. A highly conserved RNA structure in the 3\u2032 non-translated region of the SARS virus was cleaved preferentially at one of the unpaired uridylate bases, demonstrating that both RNA structure and base-pairing can affect cleavage by Nsp15. Several modified RNAs that are not cleaved by Nsp15 can bind Nsp15 as competitive inhibitors. The RNA binding affinity of Nsp15 increased with the content of uridylate in substrate RNA and the co-factor Mn 2+ . The hexameric form of Nsp15 was found to bind RNA in solution. A two-dimensional crystal of Nsp15 in complex with RNA showed that at least two RNA molecules could be bound per hexamer. Furthermore, an 8.3 \u00c5 structure of Nsp15 was developed using cyroelectron microscopy, allowing us to generate a model of the Nsp15-RNA complex.",

SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV, which has a \u223c30 kb, capped and polyadenylated positive-strand RNA genome. 4, 5 The genome of coronaviruses code for several proteins not usually found in RNA viruses, including enzymes that putatively function in RNA processing. 6 These proteins include: Nsp14, an exonuclease and Nsp15, which has similarities to the U16 SnoRNA processing endonuclease, XendoU. 7, 8 The roles of these putative RNA processing proteins in SARS-CoV infection remain to be elucidated. Bhardwaj et al. and Ivanov et al. demonstrated independently that the recombinant Nsp15 protein of the SARS-CoV produced in Escherichia coli has endoribonuclease activity that preferentially cleaves RNAs at uridylate in a reaction stimulated by Mn 2+ . 1,2 Furthermore, a single-nucleotide mutation in the Nsp15 gene of the human coronavirus prevented viral RNA accumulation, suggesting that Nsp15 is required for successful viral infection. 1 A more thorough analysis of mutations in the Nsp15 ortholog of the related Arterivirus revealed that several mutations, including those in the putative active site, reduced viral plaque formation, but did not abolish infection in cultured cells. 9 In contrast, several other mutations prevented infection and reduced subgenomic RNA accumulation. It is thus likely that Nsp15 may have more than one role in the infection cycles of coronaviruses and its relatives.",

            "text": "E-mail address of the corresponding author: ckao@tamu.edu A number of mechanistic questions remain concerning how Nsp15 recognizes and cleaves RNA. First, it is not clear what features in the RNA can direct higher affinity recognition of the RNA substrate. While Bhardwaj et al. observed that single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) is preferred for cleavage, Ivanov et al. proposed that the preferred substrate is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). 1, 2 Second, Guarino et al. demonstrated that Nsp15 exists as a hexameric structure (a dimer of trimers), whose formation is correlated with endoribonuclease activity. 3 This raises the question of whether hexamers are required for RNA binding. Third, whether Mn 2+ participates in cleavage or RNA binding has not been determined. Lastly, there is a discrepancy in the literature about the activity of Nsp15. Ivanov et al. concluded that Nsp15 cleaves both 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 of a uridine base in structured RNA, while Bhardwaj et al. reported cleavage 5\u2032 of the uridine. 1, 2 In both of these reports, the claim of 5\u2032 cleavage was based primarily on the migration of the RNAs relative to molecular mass markers in denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Additional analysis of RNA recognition and cleavage by Nsp15 is thus needed to define its mechanism of action.",

For the other RNAs, only the residues surrounding the modifications are shown. m denotes a 2\u2032methoxy group and f denotes a 2\u2032-fluoro group. p denotes a phosphodiester and s denotes a phosphorothioate. T 50 and T 70 values for each RNA were derived from plots of the amount of products formed over a 1 h time-course. the unmodified R16.4 (T 50 ) was 14 min (Figure 1(c) ). Furthermore, RNAs with U13 modified with a 2\u2032methoxy or a 2\u2032-fluoro group (RNAs mU13 and fU13, respectively), were not cleavage by Nsp15 (Figure 1(c) ). Next, we determined whether methylation of the neighboring nucleotides (mC12 and mA14) affected cleavage. The T 50 for mC12, and mA14 was 12 min and 14 min., respectively, which is similar to that for R16.4 (Figure 1(c) ). These results indicate that only the ribose in the target uridylate influences cleavage at that nucleotide.",

A \u223c4-fold reduction in cleavage was observed when the base 3\u2032 of the target uridylate was changed from the original A to a G (Figure 3(a) ). Furthermore, C at position 14 (relevant sequence of -CUC-) resulted in two cleavage products, suggesting that two cleavages took place at the positions indicated by the backslash: -C/ UC-and -CU/ C (Figure 3(a) ). These cleavages were not observed with a target sequence of -GUC-or -AUC-( Figure  3 (b)). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to confirm the Nsp15 cleavage site in the RNA with the -CUC-target sequence. The spectrum of untreated RNA showed a single peak of 5126. All of these results demonstrate that the identity of the nucleotide immediately 3\u2032 of the uridylate can influence cleavage by Nsp15. Also, Nsp15 could cleave at a cytidylate in a certain sequence context. It is important to note, however, where Nsp15 did cleave at a cytidylate, it did so 3\u2032 of the cytidylate. Determination of the kinetic parameters for cleavage at C12 and U13 indicates that these cleavages occurred at similar rates, with K m = 15 \u03bcM and V max = 0.05 \u03bcM/min for cleavage at C12 and K m = 26.9 \u03bcM and V max = 0.08 \u03bcM/min for cleavage at U13.",

Next, we replaced the C4 carbonyl group of U13 with a thio group in RNA 4SU and found that the T 50 was increased from 13 min to 33 min (Figure 4 (a)). Lastly, we replaced the imino group of the uracil with an N3 methyl group (N3-Me) and found that cleavage was abolished ( Figure 4 (a)). Thus, moieties in the target uracil are required for cleavage by Nsp15. Since these moieties would be blocked in a base-paired portion of the RNA, we hypothesize that Nsp15 will preferentially cleave only sites within unpaired RNA.",

Robertson et al. recently solved the crystal structure of a highly conserved 48 nt RNA from the 3\u2032 non-translated region of the SARS-CoV. 15 This RNA, called s2m, contains several interesting features, including a right-angle turn and a 5 nt loop that mimics a tetraloop ( Figure 4 (b)). s2m contains a potential cleavage site in the 5 nt loop at position 25 and in the right-angle bend at nucleotide 30 ( Figure 4 (b)). When s2m was labeled at the 5\u2032 terminus and subjected to cleavage by Nsp15, a 30 nt product accumulated over time, indicating preferential cleavage at U30 (Figure 4 (c)). A fragment corresponding to U25 was not detected, perhaps due to other interactions within the tetraloop, which would protect it. Larger fragments of \u223c40-48 nt were detected, which could correspond to RNAs that were cleaved at U residues near the 3\u2032 end. When the products were resolved in a 25% polyacrylamide gel, fragments of 5 nt or 6 nt in length were detected. These products likely arose from cleavage of the long helix when the ends frayed and the exposed uridylate bases became accessible to Nsp15 (Figure 4 (c), lower panel). This observation explains the apparently non-stoichiometric conversion of the full-length s2m to the 30 nt product (Figure 4(c) ). Significantly, we did not observe efficient cleavage at base-paired U42, U37 or U9. Altogether, the results in Figure 4 suggest that Nsp15 cleavage is influenced by RNA structure, and that only some uridylate bases in the loops of RNA are cleaved preferentially.",

Since Nsp15 has a cleavage mechanism similar to that of RNase A, we selected two fluorogenic RNase A substrates that have been P]ATP were used as molecular mass markers. The denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel on the top was electrophoresed using conditions that better resolve the longer RNAs while the denaturing 25% polyacrylamide gel at the bottom retained the smaller molecular cleavage products generated from the 5\u2032 end of s2m. developed for real time assays, named rU and rC. Both substrates contain three deoxyribonucleotides and either a uridylate or a cytidylate as the only ribonucleotide. In addition, rU and rC both contain a 5\u2032 carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and a 3\u2032 fluorescence resonance energy transfer quencher, tetramethylrhodamine. Cleavage by ribonuclease is expected to relieve quenching and increase fluorescence ( Figure  5(a) ). Fluorescence from these substrates was recorded continuously at 518 nm, a wavelength suitable for FAM. As expected, no increase in fluorescence was observed in reactions containing rC and Nsp15, even in the presence of Mn 2+ , since Nsp15 does not cleave RNAs efficiently at cytidylate, except in a specific sequence context ( Figure 3 ). Some fluorescence was observed with rU in the absence of Mn 2+ , but the addition of Mn 2+ increased the rate of cleavage significantly ( Figure 5(a) ). The role of Mn 2+ in Nsp15 activity will be addressed later. Furthermore, the addition of the inactive mutant H234A resulted in only a minimal change in the fluorescent emission over the same time-course (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the assay can be used to examine the effects of competitors.",

Importantly, the primary structure is that of a hexamer arranged in the form of a dimer of trimers, corroborating the structures observed previously. 3 However, this data set is more complete than that used for image construction by Guarino et al. 3 and revealed significantly more features of the hexamer; nearly all of the potential particle orientations were observed, as represented by the asymmetric triangle in Figure  8 Figure  8(e) ).

To determine how Nsp15 recognizes RNA, we used the lipid monolayer method to produce 2D crystals of Nsp15 K289A in the presence or in the absence of RNA. K289A was selected because it is catalytically inactive and forms hexamers efficiently. 3 For ease of manipulation, these 2D crystals were stained with uranyl acetate, which will obscure some features of Nsp15. However, we were able to detect the location of three different RNAs in complex with Nsp15. The first is Stem-loop T, which has tightly compacted structure that was solved by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and demonstrated to interact with Nsp15. 2, 18 The second is a 40 bp poly(I:C) synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide (Supplementary Data Figure 3 ). The third RNA is U16, which binds well to Nsp15 (Figure 9 (a), (b) and (d)). In all of the crystallization attempts, the RNA was at a tenfold higher stoichiometry than Nsp15.",

This projection closely resembles the side-on view of the 3D structure of Nsp15 that was determined by singleparticle analysis. 3 However, Nsp15 in complex with U16 produced lattices with a slightly different unit cell dimensions and distinct additional densities at the inter-trimer interface (Figure 9 (d); a = 9.6 nm, b = 18 nm, with \u03b3 = 83.8\u00b0).

It is possible that not all bound RNA molecules are visible in the orientation we are using, since there is no differentiation of information along the z-axis in the projection.

While an endoribonuclease may be useful in the processing of the SARS-CoV RNAs and/or in attacking cellular RNAs, its presence raises the question of how can Nsp15 be regulated to prevent unintended cleavage of the viral genome. Some precedence is provided by the pestivirus endoribonuclease E rns , which is also a structural glycoprotein. 29 E rns could be kept in an inactive form until is it assembled outside of the viral capsid. We note that the Nsp15 hexamer is the form that binds RNA efficiently ( Figure 6 ), and that all three Nsp15-RNA cocrystals have the RNA positioned at the interface between the dimers of trimers (Figure 9 and Supplemental Data Figure 3 ), suggesting that hexamer formation needs to precede RNA binding, and that the active site is on the surface of the hexamer. Also, the specificity required for RNA cleavage could protect the SARS-CoV RNA, since not all uridylate bases within an RNA molecule are equally sensitive to cleavage, as seen with s2m (Figure 4 (c) and (d)D). The complex of Nsp15 and RNA awaits further structural and biochemical analysis in order to confirm the proposed model of interaction (Figure 9 (e)).",
