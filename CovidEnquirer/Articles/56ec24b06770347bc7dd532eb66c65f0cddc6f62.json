Indeed, public awareness and attitudes can help in disaster risk reduction and management efforts toward reducing mortality and economic losses. In Saudi Arabia, many cities have been recently experiencing incidences of disasters, such as floods, disease epidemics, and sandstorms. However, studies on public perception of disaster risk in the country are few and nascent. Therefore, based on a questionnaire survey (n \u00bc 683), this paper explores public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in Dammam, a coastal metropolis in Saudi Arabia. The findings indicate that although almost two-thirds (64.7%) of the participants are aware of disasters, and 81% are concerned about disaster risks, less than half (47.3%) believe that their settlements could be at risk. While 37% opine that disasters are caused by both natural factors and human activities, about half (54%) indicate that they can personally contribute to reducing disaster risks. Chi-square analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between place of residence and perception of disaster risks (\u03c72 (6) \u00bc 56.18, p < 0.05), and between place of residence and concern about disaster risks (\u03c72 (12) \u00bc 68.47, p < 0.05). The paper recommends raising public awareness and encouraging positive behaviors in reducing disaster risks in the study area and similar environments.",

From 1990 to 2013, about 90% of global mortality caused by disasters happened in low and middle-income countries [2] . Asian countries are the most vulnerable to disasters in the world.

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11.5 targets, by 2030, to \"significantly reduce deaths and economic losses caused by disasters, including water-related disasters\" [7] . Also, advancing climate change adaptation is contingent upon managing the hazards of extreme events and disasters [8, 9] . The literature stresses the importance of public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in developing and implementing disaster management plans, building resilience and adaptation measures, which refer to adjustment in the existing physical, socioeconomic or political systems in response to actual or anticipated risks [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Developing risk management procedures is also hampered by the dearth of data. According to the 2018 review of SDGs implementation, \"a number of challenges in data availability to track progress towards implementation of SDG 11 also present significant barriers to assessing global progress on the goal\" [1] . Enhancing public awareness of disaster risks is found to effectively enhance disaster risk management by formulating more effective hazard mitigation policies and intervention measures. Citizens are nowadays seen as active partners in risk management, which is an emerging and popular field of disaster science [4, 16, 17] .",

The country is placed on the 84th highest position on the 2018 Global Climate Risk Index due to frequent coastal flooding, lack of freshwater sources, high temperatures, and vegetation cover of less than 2% of the total land area [19] . Despite the existence of many seismic and volcanic areas, the country has only experienced low-magnitude earthquakes of not more than 4 on the Richter scale [18] . The most catastrophic disasters in the country are floods, sandstorms, and disease epidemics such as swine flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Rift Valley fever [16, [20] [21] [22] . In 2009, swine flu affected 15850 people and caused 124 deaths throughout the country [20] ; p. 12). Jeddah and Dammam cities being coastal settlements, and Riyadh being surrounded by valleys are the three major cities that faced yearly incidences of floods in the country. However, \"less attention is paid to natural disasters, despite their frequent occurrence and the devastation they caused on people's lives and property\" compared to human-made disasters such as fires, stampedes and road accidents [21] ; p. 3256).",

Similarly, social capital can provide considerable social protection that can mitigate the adverse effect of disasters [4] . In Nagoya City (Japan) for example, the four main factors that influence people's preparedness for disasters are the level of disaster anticipation and fear, disaster experience, the enormity of damage from a previous disaster, and homeownership [33] . Disaster awareness fosters behavioral change for reducing a wide range of risks. It is a facilitator of taking precautionary measures and protective behaviors such as taking property insurance, staying in a safe area and away from windows, not driving, informational listening and checking for updates, and following evacuation instructions from local authorities [24] . Given that disaster perception and awareness are useful in assessing the level of public preparedness, it is imperative to ask: to what extent do the residents of cities that are vulnerable to natural hazards such as Dammam perceive the risks of disasters?",

To reduce the vulnerability of citizens during flood disasters, the study called for \"improving the communication and dissemination of information on environmental hazards in a given area\" (p. 172). In Cologne, Germany, Grothmann and Reusswig [24] investigated why some residents took precautionary actions against flood risks while others did not. The authors found that to encourage people to participate in damage prevention, it is essential to communicate flood risks and its consequences, and the feasibility and efficacy of personal precautionary measures.

However, the study neither asked the residents their perceived causes of floods nor their preferred methods of disaster risk communication. In Jingdezhen City (China), Wang et al. [17] found that previous flood knowledge and experience, and trust in government significantly influenced public perception of flood risks but did not investigate whether the respondents were willing to participate in risk mitigation activities in the event of a disaster. As such, the present research contributes to filling these knowledge gaps and builds on the literature using the following methods.",

It is the third-largest metropolitan area in the country after Riyadh and Jeddah. The metropolis' population was 1.166 million people in 2018, and it is one of the seven metropolises that house half of the country's 33 million population [35] . In about half a century (1950-2014), the population has dramatically risen from 100,000 to almost 1.66 million people, which is expected to reach 2.13 million in the next decade [36] . The size of DMA has expanded from a small fishing town to a metropolis spanning about 562 km 2 with a population density of about 2000 persons/km 2 [37] . DMA consists of the three main cities; Dammam, Khobar and Dhahran, in addition to the suburban area of Aziziyah and Half Moon Bay (Fig. 1) . While the city of Dammam contains most of the regional administrative institutions, Khobar city consists of commercial centers and corporate headquarters, and Dhahran city serves as the center for science and technology, as it hosts Dhahran Techno-valley and the headquarter of Saudi Arabian American Oil Company. Aziziyah and Half Moon Bay area is a new sprawling residential development along the Arabian/Persian Gulf, famous for its recreational and tourist centers. The study area has been recently experiencing severe storms that left streets drenched, homes and schools in low-lying areas flooded and residents stranded when their day-to-day lives were disrupted [38]. These incidences have caused road and rail accidents, injuries, loss of properties and damage to infrastructure and the local economy [39] .",

Globally, out of 335 cases of disasters that killed 9697 people in 2017, there were more incidences of floods (37.9%), followed by storms (37.6%), with earthquakes coming distant third (6.6%) [2] ; p. 3).

Most of the questions were close-ended requiring responses on a five-point Likert Scale: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree. Other questions require ranking of responses as well as selecting from yes, no, or neutral options. The questionnaire was designed in English with Arabic translation.

The link to the survey was distributed via email and social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) using a snowball sampling technique in which respondents were asked to share the link with others living in the study area [44] . After four months, the questionnaire has reached 683 participants, which according to Cochran's formula is considered an adequate sample size for a city of 1.17 million people and based on 0.05 level of significance [45] . Ethical issues have been taken into consideration. The confidentiality of all participants and utilizing the survey data for only academic purposes have been guaranteed in writing, as well as the voluntary nature of participation in the study. Snowballing, albeit being a non-probability sampling approach, is considered a robust scientific approach that enables a researcher to anonymously study a community and with a high response rate [44] . Moreover, it is beneficial in circumstances where it is challenging or expensive to reach study participants. For instance, in Saudi Arabia, it is quite difficult to distribute print questionnaires to the public or recruit female respondents due to cultural privacy concerns [46] .",

Pearson's Chi-square test is suitable for establishing whether there is a statistically significant relationship between a dependent variable such as public perception/attitudes to disaster risks and a categorical predictor variable with at least two independent groups such as place of residence, gender or educational level [11, 33] . To ensure the consistency of questionnaire items, checking data reliability is essential, and the Cronbach's alpha of 0.6 or higher is an acceptable level of reliability in exploratory research [47] . In the present study, the Cronbach's alpha is 0.72, thus the overall reliability of the questionnaire items is adequate. Table 1 illustrates the general characteristics of the respondents who are largely male (73%). This low representation of women is not unexpected in a patriarchal society, coupled with the fact that the local culture frowns on women interacting with unrelated persons. Low female response rates in Saudi Arabia have been reported in similar studies, such as 25.3% [11] and 31% [16] . About two-thirds (69%) of the participants are married, comparable to 72.3% documented by Alshehri et al [11] . Around 63% of the respondents have household sizes of at least three, comparable to the country's average family size of 5.6 [35] . Two-thirds (66%) of the participants are aged 18-40 years, which reflects the country's demography that is dominated by the youthful population: 30 years median age [48] . All the participants are educated up to high school, which mirrors the country's 94.7% literacy rate [48] . As expected, the public sector is the main employer of this study respondents (45%), which is similar to 57% government sector employment reported by Alshehri et al. [11] , followed by 23.7% students, 16.2% company employees and few retirees, while 9.4% are unemployed, which is close to 7.6% unemployment rate reported in a similar study [11] , but quite lower than the 2018 estimated national unemployment rate of 24.3% [44] .

First, they were given a list of seven major disaster events [2] to select those they consider as having risks to their lives and properties ( Table 2 ). The result shows that, despite the absence of a high-magnitude earthquake in the whole country, it was selected by 73% of the respondents, perhaps due to its destructive nature that respondents often observe through the media. The flood came second (67%), trailed slightly by disease epidemics (65%), while the least chosen event was landslide (40%), which is not surprising considering that the country being in a desert environment does not experience landslides. However, as mentioned earlier, floods followed by epidemics are the most common natural hazards in the country [11] . Disaster risk awareness and perception are indeed influenced by the type of disaster and persons' character.",

Because the four settlements that constituted DMA differ in proximity to the Arabian/Persian Gulf, this study also explored whether there is a significant relationship between the difference in respondents' place of residence and their perception of disaster risks. This is because previous studies have strongly linked location with different levels of risk perception [24] . The Chi-square value (56.18) shows a statistically significant (p < 0.05) relationship between respondents' thoughts about the likelihood of imminent disasters and their location (Table 3 ). In all the four cities that constitute the study area, respondents that believed that they could be affected by a disaster at any time are almost twice those that think that they cannot be affected. This could be attributed to the incidences of floods that occur almost annually in their cities [23] .",

In this study, a little over half of the respondents (56%) indicated being aware of the emergency procedures that need to be followed in the event of disasters (Fig. 5) . By contrast, 25% of them were not aware of these procedures and 19% had no opinion. The result from Chi-square analysis reveals a statistically significant association (p-value \u00bc 0.001) between the place of residence and awareness of the emergency procedures during disasters (\u03c72 \u00bc 58.87). More respondents living in Dammam (21.0%) are aware of emergency procedures, followed by those living in Khobar (14.5%), Aziziyah (11.9%) and Dhahran (8.6%). Even though public awareness can help lessen the harmful effects of disasters, a prior study found that \"cultural misconceptions and incorrect beliefs and attitudes\" could cause inadequate public behavior in disaster preparedness and response [30] . Apart from educational institutions, informal education acquired at the family and community level is also valuable in encouraging an individual to act for reducing risks [22, 50] . Also, identifying the most effective means of accessing disasterrelated information is important in communicating risk information among citizens and developing more adaptive and resilience schemes for disaster management involving educating the public. The present study found that 67% of the respondents do access information about disaster risks and mitigation and they were given eight options to select their main existing and preferred methods of accessing the information. As Table 7 shows, television is the main existing avenue respondents used to access disaster-related information (28%), followed by mobile text messages (24%). However, close to half (46%) preferred to access such information via text messages, followed by social media like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp (27%). By relegating from the first existing information source to the fourth preferred source, it seems that television is becoming an outdated avenue of disseminating information about disasters. The radio, newspapers, family and friends and other approaches such as meetings and seminars also remain the last four (ranked 5-8) existing and preferred approaches. Thus, mobile phone text messages and social media are key in contributing to raising public awareness about and raising their confidence level in responding to disaster risks.",

A prior national study has reported that 78% of the participants were aware of the risks of the last disaster that affected the country [16] . In Taiwan, landslide received the highest risk rating followed by floods and earthquakes, but contagious diseases were considered the least risky [12] . Globally, in 2017, floods ranked first (34.4%) in terms of human loss due to disasters, followed by storms (25.9%), landslides (23.8%) and earthquakes (10.4%) ( [2] ; p. 4).

In Cologne, self-protective manners by residents of urban areas prone to floods helped in reducing the economic cost of floods by about 80% [24] . In Jingdezhen city in China, only 13.8% of the participants of a study held that the public should also be responsible for flood protection [17] . In the north of Italy, 60% of study participants felt willing to adopt some behaviors for reducing their vulnerability to floods or landslides [13] . Thus, residents of DMA should be encouraged to be more willing to partake in disaster risk reduction activities using platforms such as online social media and educational institutions, which are effective avenues for changing common perceptions of disaster risks, increasing public awareness about disaster management, and encouraging them to take cautionary behaviors [30, 32] .",

This result is consistent with that of a similar study that found that raising public risk awareness was rated as the first factor for reducing disaster risks followed by early warning systems [11] . However, our respondents' opinion sharply contrasts with experts' assessment of the quality of flood disaster management by Civil Defense and Red Crescent after the 2009-2010 floods in Jeddah. According to the experts (40 senior officials involved in disaster and emergency management in the city), response time and efficiency were the most important factors for reducing disaster risks [21] . In line with the findings of this study, adopting protective behaviors such as having a working flashlight, a list of emergency phone numbers and teaching relatives and neighbors what to do in emergency cases are the most important approaches for reducing flood risks in the north of Italy [13] . Choices of cautionary and protective behaviors made by persons living in disaster-prone settlements are related to their risk awareness, perception, and evaluation [5] .",

Instead of utilizing the existing traditional approach of using state-owned television, the government should rather utilize text messaging services, social media, and the Internet (ranked as the first, second and third most preferred approaches of getting disaster-related information, respectively) for timely communicating of disaster risks. In another study, Alshehri et al. [16] found that 55% of study participants access official information about biological disasters through the Internet. After the 2011 flood in Jeddah, online social media was used for publicizing the gravity of the disaster, advising people what to do and what to avoid, and mobilization for help and rescue [32] . Social media has been useful in communicating the impacts of disasters, their possible causes and who was responsible, and suggesting actions for remedying the situation. The Internet and social media have been considered as promising in providing opportunities for greater social and political participation. Given the Internet penetration rate of 40.2% in the Middle East, compared to 34.3% global average [30] , the social media should be extensively used for sharing information about disaster situations and identifying the needed support, which is indeed the approach most preferred by the citizens. There is also the need to improve public access to vital information about disaster preparedness for increasing community awareness, knowledge and skills in disaster risk mitigation [52] . In 2013, the Saudi Ministry of Interior has developed emergency call and operation centers for event reporting and dispatch operations towards enhancing disaster response efficiency to be established in each of the country's 13 provinces [53] . While these centers could support the operational capacities of safety and security agencies [53] , utilizing social media can facilitate citizen participation and engagement in public affairs. Social media can be effective for disaster warning and evacuation procedures and it can influence decision-makers to be more responsive in disaster mitigation. They are also effective in motivating and guiding inhabitants of disaster-prone areas to actively partake in risk preparedness and prevention [24] . Integrating local knowledge with scientific and technical know-how is crucial to disaster risk management for minimizing human and economic losses [31] .",
