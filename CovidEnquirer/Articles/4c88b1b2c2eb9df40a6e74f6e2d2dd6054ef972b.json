            "text": "O NLY OVER THE last 5 years have measures been implemented to reduce the risks of 2 of the 3 leading causes of transfusion-related deaths; these are the risks of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated sepsis (TAS). Together with ABO and non-ABO hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs), these 3 appear to be the most common causes of allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT)-related mortality seen in the United States today. 1 Although the etiology of these risks had been known for years 2-4 and measures for their prevention had been advocated previously, 5,6 it was only in March 2004 and November 2006, respectively, that the AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) recommended that blood establishments limit and detect bacterial contamination in all platelet components, 7 as well as collect fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and single-donor platelets solely from male donors (or female donors without a history of pregnancy or shown not to have white blood cell [WBC] antibodies). 8 Bacterial contamination of blood components results from the introduction of low concentrations of skin bacteria at the time of phlebotomy, less commonly from asymptomatic donor bacteremia, or rarely during blood processing. 9 Before various process improvements started to be introduced around 2004, platelets and red blood cells (RBCs) were, respectively, responsible for 70% and 30% of fatalities from TAS. 9 This is because platelets are stored at room temperature-allowing for bacterial proliferation-and also because platelets are more often given to patients susceptible to bacterial infection, that is, to neutropenic subjects who also often have an impaired immune system. Accordingly, most efforts to reduce the risk of TAS have hitherto specifically targeted platelet components. 7 The efforts to reduce the risk of TRALI have targeted specifically FFP and single-donor platelets. 8 This is because, depending on how TRALI is defined, 10,11 WBC alloantibodies are identified in 25% to 90% of the donors implicated in TRALI cases. 12 Such donor antibodies are believed to attack the recipient's WBCs in the microcirculation of the lungs, causing noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. 2,5 Most donors implicated in TRALI have been multiparous women alloimmunized to paternal WBC alloantigens during pregnancy. 13 Blood products containing a large volume of plasma from an individual donor, thus, could contain a large amount of a WBC antibody directed against a cognate WBC antigen of a particular transfusion recipient. As a result, such products could be more likely to cause TRALI than products containing a small volume of plasma if transfused into a recipient carrying the corresponding WBC alloantigen. 5 This possibility led to the recommendation that FFP and single-donor platelets be collected solely from male donors (or female donors without a history of pregnancy or shown not to have WBC antibodies). 8 It was the hemovigilance reports from France, 14 the United Kingdom, 15, 16 and the province of Quebec in Canada, 17 along with the reports on transfusion-related deaths from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 1,4,18-21 that focused our attention on TAS and TRALI, along with HTRs, as the major contemporary causes of ABTrelated mortality and major morbidity. These reports 1, 4, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and the ensuing mandates 7, 8 resulted in the risks of TAS and TRALI being at least partly addressed over the last 5 years, although the risk of HTRs still remains to be directly confronted.",

            "text": "Well into the 1990s, the attention of transfusion medicine professionals remained concentrated on the morbidity and mortality associated with transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). Although only 3 years had elapsed between the recognition of the threat that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) posed to blood safety (1982) and the implementation of donor testing (1985) , approximately 12 000 cases of transfusion-acquired HIV infection were estimated to have occurred in the United States. 22 When the interval between recognition and introduction of testing was longer, the number of transfusion-acquired infections was correspondingly higher. Thus, in 1970 to 1990, there were 4.8 million cases of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmitted through ABT. 23 Even if only 3% of these resulted in fatal cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term survivors, 24 and if only 30% of transfusion recipients survived long enough to develop such complications, 25 43 200 ABT-related deaths could still have ensued. 26 This mortality from TTIs before the 1990s dwarfed the concomitant mortality from TRALI, TAS, and HTRs, focusing blood safety efforts toward the prevention of TTIs. As a result, the past 2 decades have witnessed an impressive reduction in the probability of transmission of HIV and HCV through ABT by up to 4 log. 27 Although the risks of TTIs have been greatly reduced, the risk of a new, or poorly understood, infectious disease with a long incubation period that can be transmitted by ABT, while it is accumulating in the blood donor base before its clinical consequences become apparent, remains a \"fixed and inevitable property of transfusion medicine.\" 28 Thus, ABT can still transmit lethal infections due to known pathogens, especially bacteria, 1,14,16,21 even while novel transfusion-transmitted, or potentially transfusion-transmitted, pathogens continue to emerge. 29 In addition to the deaths caused by the noninfectious and infectious complications of ABT, there are also deaths attributed to ABT by observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) through pathophysiologic mechanisms that we do not yet understand. In particular, RCTs comparing cardiac surgery patients randomized to receive non-WBC-reduced RBCs vs RBCs from which the WBCs had been removed by WBC reduction filters have attributed increased mortality to the receipt of non-WBC-reduced (compared with WBC-reduced) ABT. 30-32 Non-WBC-reduced (compared with WBC-reduced) ABT has not been associated with a defined cause(s) of death in these RCTs. 33 Nevertheless, the magnitude of the absolute risk reduction attributed to WBC reduction in the RCT of van de Watering et al 30 was impressive, a statistically significant greater mortality of 7.8% vs 3.5%, in subjects receiving non-WBC-reduced vs WBC-reduced RBCs, respectively. Although overall mortality has been lower in the United States 32 than reported in the Dutch 30,31 RCTs, such potentially WBC-mediated adverse ABT effects 30-32 could account for a larger number of ABT-related deaths than all the currently established complications of ABT combined! Observational studies comparing transfused and untransfused patients [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] have also reported increased mortality in association with ABT per se, independently of the receipt of non-WBC-reduced vs WBC-reduced RBCs. In the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) RCT patients allocated to receive RBC transfusion based on restrictive vs liberal transfusion criteria demonstrated a trend (P = .11) toward increased 30day mortality, as well as increased in-hospital mortality (P = .05), in association with greater exposure to ABT in the liberal transfusion arm. 39 This review will thus present estimates of the mortality from infectious and noninfectious ABT complications in the United States today and will advocate for the adoption of 6 specific interventions to prevent transfusion-related deaths. In particular, these 6 strategies to further reduce ABT-related mortality will be assessed for their impact upon reducing deaths from ABT.",

            "text": "Data on transfusion complications, including deaths from transfusion complications, come from passive surveillance (\"hemovigilance\") studies, active surveillance studies, as well as both RCTs and observational studies. Both the observational studies and the RCTs evaluate consecutive transfused patients at a particular setting(s) as part of a research protocol and-in theory-would be expected to produce the most reliable data. Their downside, however, is that they usually enroll a number of transfused patients that is much too small to document the incidence of rare transfusion complications (or the risk of death from ABT). Active surveillance studies are conducted at a particular hospital or at \"sentinel\" sites in which there is heightened awareness of, and special arrangements have been made for detecting, usually a specific transfusion complication. Passive surveillance systems rely on passive (and often voluntary) reporting of adverse events associated with ABT, including ABT-related deaths. Such hemovigilance systems have been in place in various countries-including France, 14 the United Kingdom, 15, 16 other European countries, and the province of Quebec 17 in Canada. No coordinated hemovigilance system exists yet in the United States, although a pilot program was recently introduced. 40 Moreover, the reporting of all identified transfusion-related deaths to the FDA has been required since 1976. 1, 4, 18 Reporting to hemovigilance systems can be mandatory (as it is in France 14 ) or voluntary (as it used to be in the United Kingdom until recently 16 ). Adverse events, including deaths, captured by these systems depend on whether a particular adverse event caused by a transfusion was suspected of being, investigated as possibly being, and/or deemed to be transfusion related based on the criteria used locally for the diagnosis of each specific transfusion complication. Whether ABT is considered as the possible cause of an adverse event or death varies with the medical and nursing staff awareness of transfusion complications at each particular clinical setting, as well as with local culture, resources, and logistics vis-\u00e0-vis the extent of the investigation and the reporting of such adverse events along the designated channels of the hemovigilance system.",

The 2 surveillance studies 41,42 encompassed all transfused patients, whereas the observational study of ICU patients 43 included only critically ill patients. This is especially important because TRALI is believed to result from an interplay of both patientand transfusion-related factors and may thus be much more common in critically ill (than other transfused) patients. Critically ill patients may also have a lower threshold for TRALI than the average transfusion recipient 44 because of sepsis, trauma, and other factors that may represent the \"first hit\" in the \"2-hit\" hypothesis of TRALI pathogenesis. 45, 46 In such critically ill patients, too, many cases of acute lung injury (ALI)-occurring in the presence of one or several alternate causes of ALI-can be misdiagnosed as TRALI because of a merely temporal association with ABT.",

Both of these conditions were satisfied, before the implementation of bacterial detection in platelets, at the Johns Hopkins Hospital (Baltimore, MD). 47, 48 Over 12 years, Ness et al 47 had implemented a system of prospective monitoring, whereby all febrile transfusion reactions to platelets were assessed by culture. Starting from a baseline of 51.7% of the therapeutic platelet doses at their hospital provided as single-donor platelets, they observed that-as the proportion of therapeutic platelet doses provided as single-donor platelets (as opposed to platelet pools) increased from 51.7% to 99.4%-the risk of TAS declined from 1 in 4818 to 1 in 15 098 platelet transfusions. 47 This 3-fold decrease in risk could be extrapolated to a 5-fold reduction (with an expected risk of TAS of 1 per 3000 platelet pools) had the authors started from no therapeutic platelet doses provided as single-donor platelets. 47 ,48 A virtually identical risk (1 per 2282 platelet pools in 2000 and 1 per 4149 platelet pools in 2001) was observed during the first 2 years of the Quebec hemovigilance program, which relied on hospitals that cultured 40.4% to 51.6% of platelet pools implicated in transfusion reactions and that were staffed with transfusion officers. 17 In contrast, in 1994 to 1998, the French hemovigilance system-probably the most comprehensive passive surveillance system that entailed mandatory reporting-observed a risk of sepsis secondary to platelet transfusion-if pools of 6 platelet concentrates are assumed-of only 1 per 13 000 platelet pools. 14 The reported risk was far lower in the United Kingdom hemovigilance program. 15, 16 Data from hemovigilance systems must therefore be interpreted in the light of this \"passive surveillance artifact\" that results in the underreporting of the overall adverse transfusion events, along with the relative overreporting of specific transfusion complications (of which the medical and nursing staff become more aware at one time or another) compared with all other transfusion complications. Influential publications in the literature and highprofile preventive efforts initiated by national blood safety agencies or professional societies, heighten clinicians' awareness of specific ABT complications, generating more diagnoses of those particular ABT-related adverse events and more reporting of such events to the hemovigilance systems.",

Together, these 3 causes of death accounted for 84% (178/212) of all fatalities reported to the US FDA. The remaining deaths were due to transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion-transmitted babesiosis, anaphylaxis, or graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). 1 When the number of deaths from the 3 leading causes of transfusion-related mortality in the United States was compared between 2004 to 2008 and 2001 to 2003, TRALI appeared to have displaced HTRs as the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality (Fig 3) . The FDA alerted transfusion medicine professionals in the United States to the possibility that transfused patients may be at increased risk of TRALI on October 19, 2001 . 49 Between 1992 and 2001, the FDA had received 45 reports of transfusion-related fatalities secondary to TRALI, and-at that time-TRALI was thought to be the third leading cause of transfusion-related mortality in the United States. As the FDA had not received any reports of TRALI fatalities before 1992, they ascribed the increase in the number of received reports of deaths due to TRALI to better recognition and reporting of TRALI. 49 The overall limited   awareness of TRALI as a transfusion complication  and as a clinical entity separate from the acute  respiratory distress syndrome 50-52 (ARDS-from  which TRALI is often clinically indistinguishable) is underscored by the fact that TRALI was not identified as a specific transfusion complication by the French hemovigilance system in 1994 to 1999. 14 Around 2004, TRALI awareness increased by the publicity associated with the United Kingdom decision to convert to \"male-only\" FFP to mitigate the risk of TRALI (October 2003) 16 and by the publicity associated with the Canadian Consensus Conference on TRALI convened to generate a standardized definition of TRALI (April 2004), followed by the promulgation of the consensus criteria for the diagnosis of TRALI (December 2004). 11 At approximately the same time, the AABB standard that blood establishments limit and detect bacterial contamination in all platelet components became effective (March 2004). 7 Various other process improvements were also implemented to reduce the risk of TAS secondary to platelet transfusion. 9 The presumed increase in TRALI awareness and the measures to reduce TAS were temporally associated with an increase in the ",

The recording by the United Kingdom SHOT system of deaths from transfusion-acquired vCJD is due to the active surveillance efforts made in the United Kingdom to identify cases of transmission of vCJD through ABT. Thus, passive surveillance systems are likely to miss even some acute infections transmitted through ABT, as has been demonstrated for TAS, 59 and was likely the case with some West Nile virus (WNV) infections occurring in New York in the summer of 1999 (when no transfusiontransmitted cases were reported) and with some dengue fever virus (DFV) infections occurring in endemic areas over many decades.",

            "text": "Since the mid-1980s, the incidence of HBV, HCV, and HIV infections has significantly declined in blood donors because of better predonation screening criteria and also a decrease in the incidence of these infections in the general population. 27 There have been no reports of fulminant transfusion-transmitted HBV infection in North America and Europe, and only a minority of transfusion recipients survive long enough 25 to develop transfusion-acquired AIDS, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma due to chronic HBV or HCV infection, adult T-cell leukemia, or HTLVassociated myelopathy. The risk of transmission of HBV infection through ABT is higher than that of HCV or HIV infection, and it will likely remain so even with the impending implementation of testing for HBV nucleic acid that will reduce the 38-day window period by 5 to 8 days. 67 Most adults infected with HBV resolve their infection. There is only a 5% chronic carrier rate in adults, and severe liver disease occurs in 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons several decades later. Immunocompromised patients and infants infected through transfusion may have a higher chronic carrier rate, as well as a higher risk of developing severe disease than the general adult population. 68 Furthermore, despite lack of HBV surface antigen detection in peripheral blood, HBV DNA can persist for decades in the serum and liver of some patients, and the clinical importance of this finding remains to be assessed in long-term studies. 69 One concern remains, that is, the concern that a benign infection may become a serious pathogen in transfusion recipients who have been rendered immunocompromised by modern medical treatments, especially immunosuppression. These transfusion-transmitted agents include Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other herpesviruses, human parvovirus B19, and Babesia species. In this context, low birth weight neonates and immunocompromised patients are at particular risk for (potentially fatal) transfusion-acquired CMV disease. Transmission of the latter may be prevented by testing donors for CMV antibody and/or removing the mononuclear cells that harbor the CMV virus by WBC reduction. Nonetheless, a small, but real and probably intractable, risk of transmission remains, whether CMV-seronegative or WBC-reduced blood components are used. This contemporary risk is 2% to 4% per transfusion recipient in the setting of bone marrow transplantation. 70,71 Thus, in 502 CMVseronegative patients enrolled in the study of Bowden et al, 70 there were 10 cases of CMV infection and 6 deaths from CMV disease. Three of these deaths could definitely be attributed to the ABT, as they had occurred in patients developing CMV disease 21 to 100 days posttransplantation. 70 In 2002, the US mosquito-borne WNV epidemic resulted in 23 confirmed cases of transfusiontransmitted WNV infection with 7 WNV-related deaths. 72 Testing for WNV nucleic acid was introduced in North America in July 2003, but WNV transmissions and deaths have occurred even after the introduction of such testing. 73 In late summer 2002, the risk of transfusion transmission of WNV may have been as high as 1 per 1000 in the most severely affected geographic regions, even though most transmissions resulted in asymptomatic infections. 74 77 The number of vCJD cases worldwide has barely exceeded 200, most of which have occurred in the United Kingdom. 78 The vCJD incidence appears to be falling; mathematical projections have suggested an upper limit of around 70 further clinical cases in the United Kingdom, 79 or that 3800 people aged 10 to 30 years (1 per 11 000 in the United Kingdom population) may be incubating the disease. 80 The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (such as vCJD) may have incubation periods of up to 50 years, 81 with infectious particles (prions) potentially circulating in the peripheral blood for much of the presymptomatic phase of the infection. 82 Thus, 86 VAMVAKAS AND BLAJCHMAN measures to protect the blood supply from the abnormal proteinaceous particles of vCJD are being actively evaluated in the United Kingdom, and implementation of a protective measure(s) is expected in the near future. Possible measures include filtration of blood components through prion-retention filters and/or testing of donor blood for the abnormally conformed prion protein by such methods as protein misfolding cyclic amplification. 82 Five probable cases of transfusion transmission of vCJD have been reported from the United Kingdom in patients who had received blood from asymptomatic donors who later developed vCJD. 83 Donor screening for protozoal transfusion-transmitted diseases began in the United States in 2007, with the introduction of testing for Trypanosoma cruzi, although various testing approaches had already been used in Europe. Between 1963 and 1999, 93 cases of transfusion-acquired malaria were reported in the United States of whom 10 (11%) died. 84 Three cases were reported in Canada between 1994 and 1999, 85 but in endemic countries, the risk of transmission can be as high as 50 cases per million RBC units transfused. 86 More than 3000 cases of transfusion-transmitted malaria have occurred worldwide, 87 although the reported cases may represent less than 50% of the actual cases. 88 Furthermore, more than 70 cases of transfusiontransmitted babesiosis-including many fatalities -have been reported from the United States. 58 This figure captures splenectomized and immunocompromised recipients at risk for severe disease and is likely an underestimate. 89 A study in an endemic area (Connecticut) estimated the risk of transfusion transmission to be 1 per 601 transfused RBCs. 90 Other potentially fatal TTIs include leishmaniasis 91 and Chagas' disease. 92-95 Any agent that even transiently traverses the human circulation during an asymptomatic phase of infection may prove transfusion transmissible. Sixty-eight potentially or known transfusion-transmitted agents were prioritized by an AABB Task Force in a special report published in July 2009. 29",

            "text": "The most dramatic example of an emerging infection is the appearance of a completely new infection, as was the case with the HIV infection. The latter probably occurred as a result of a crossspecies transmission of simian immunodeficiency viruses from monkeys to great apes and then to humans. 96 The original transmission probably occurred as a result of the preparation of bushmeat derived from apes. Another cause of the emergence of novel agents is the expansion of existing infections into a larger geographic area; a striking example of such expansion was the recent appearance of WNV in the Americas. 97 In a similar manner, DFV and Chikungunya virus may very well be expanding their current geographic regions. [98] [99] [100] Provided that an agent can survive in blood components and can be transmitted by the intravenous route, any infection with an asymptomatic blood-borne phase has the potential for transmission by ABT. This possibility exists, whether the infectious phase is prolonged (as is the case with HIV, HBV, or HCV infection) or short (as is the case with WNV or DFV infection). The frequency with which an infection is transmitted to a transfusion recipient depends on the length of the asymptomatic blood-borne phase, how often blood is donated during this period, and the immune status of the recipient population. 29 The AABB Task Force 29 recently prioritized 68 potentially or known transfusion-transmitted agents based on both the existing scientific and epidemiologic evidence of their transmissibility through ABT and their potential for severe clinical outcomes that could result in public attention and concern. Four priority categories were assigned to convey a particular agent's significance as follows: white, yellow, orange, and red. Agents included in the red category were the vCJD prions, DFV, and Babesia species. Agents included in the orange category were Leishmania species, Plasmodium species, Trypanosoma cruzi, Chickungunya virus, and St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV). 29 With the exception of the last 2 agents (Chickungunya virus and SLEV), all other agents prioritized as red or orange have been shown to be transfusion transmitted.",

For both Chickungunya virus and SLEV, the Task Force's concern was that these agents have the potential to replicate the 2002 WNV US experience in the future. Concerning the United States, the Task Force judged the medical and scientific evidence 87 TRANSFUSION-RELATED MORTALITY for transmission of Babesia species to be moderate to high, whereas the evidence for DFV and vCJD prions was judged to be low. Nonetheless, concerning the effect in developing countries, the medical and scientific evidence for transmission of DFV was judged to be moderate. 29 Three transfusion-transmitted agents have emerged in the last 30 years as follows: HIV, vCJD prions, and WNV. Therefore, it is not prudence but common sense to assume that what happened in the past can (or will) happen again in the future. The worst that can happen is that an HIV-like pathogen with a long incubation period could emerge that-owing to its long asymptomatic blood-borne phase-could accumulate to a significant extent in the blood donor population before it becomes recognized, thereby almost reaching the prevalence of the HIV infection in the US blood donor population before testing for HIV antibody was introduced. In 1984-the year before testing of US blood donors for HIV infection commenced-the prevalence of HIV infection in donors exceeded 1 per 1000. 101 Because of the surveillance systems put in place after the 1980s epidemic of transfusion-acquired HIV infection, it is unlikely that a new viral agent causing chronic infection could go undetected for as long as HIV went undetected, and therefore, infection with a new viral agent would be most unlikely to reach a prevalence of 1 per 1000 US blood donors.",

Thus, worst case scenarios of all strategies to further reduce ABT-related mortality should consistently model the possibility of an HIV-like pathogen reaching a prevalence of 1 per 10 000 US blood donors before measures are introduced to interrupt its transmission through transfusion. 102 Importantly, we cannot exclude the possibility that the accumulation of such a pathogen in the US blood donor population may have already started occurring.",

Thus, the risk of contracting a TTI from a transfusion of n units (or from exposure to n donors) would equal 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) n , where p is the per-unit probability of transmission of the emerging TTI. Because transfusion risks are very low (eg, 1 per 10 000 in the case of a future HIV-like agent), 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) n approximates p times n, and the perrecipient risk can be calculated by multiplying the per-unit risk by the number of donors to whom a recipient is exposed.",

Given that skin bacteria are the major sources of contamination, the difference between measured contamination rates in stored components and septic reactions in transfused patients likely can be explained by low-level contamination that does not evoke a clinical response, concomitant antibiotic therapy that blunts a clinical response, and/or failure to (correctly) attribute sepsis to the platelet transfusion in patients with neutropenia or fever.",

Reducing the allowable storage time to 3 days would prevent such episodes but would very likely result in supply problems. Moreover, 50% of the SHOT fatalities were due to platelet components aged 2 to 3 days. Reducing the storage time would not prevent fatal cases such as these. In some European centers, the introduction of bacterial detection in platelets using automated culture systems enabled the storage time to be extended to 7 days. The US FDA had allowed the storage time of platelets to be extended to 7 days in 1983, but it soon returned the shelf life back to 5 days because of a reported increased incidence of fatal TAS episodes. 107 Recently, experimental protocols considering extension of the storage time of platelets to 7 days (after the introduction of automated bacterial culture systems) were halted in the United States because of an increased incidence of TAS. 108 The same relationship between prolonged storage and increased risk of TAS has been reported for RBCs contaminated with Yersinia enterocolitica. Yersinia grows well at 4\u00b0C, uses the citrate of the preservative solution as a source of energy, and, owing to its lack of siderophores, requires iron for optimum growth. Stored RBCs thus provide an ideal growth medium for this microorganism. In almost all serious reactions to RBCs containing Y enterocolitica, the RBCs had been stored for more than 3 weeks. 109 Before or around 2004, improved donor selection (intended to exclude prospective donors with bacteremia), improved donor arm disinfection, diversion of the initial flow of donor blood (presumed to contain the skin contaminants) from the collection bag into a pouch, overnight hold of the collected whole blood, and/or WBC reduction had reduced, but not eliminated, the risk of bacterial contamination of blood components. 9 In 2004, the AABB required measures to limit and detect bacterial contamination in all platelet components. At that time, suitable automated bacterial culture systems were available only for apheresis platelets in the United States but have since become available to be used for pooled whole bloodderived platelets as well.",

            "text": "Transfusion-related acute lung injury has emerged as the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality in the United States (Figs 1 and 2). 1 Transfusion-related acute lung injury is a new ALI occurring within 6 hours after a transfusion, with a clear temporal relationship to the transfusion, in patients without risk factors for ALI other than transfusion. 10,125 Thus, the Canadian Consensus Conference definition of TRALI 11 was based on the American-European Consensus conference definition of ALI 50 and a temporal relationship to the transfusion. The definition of ALI requires that the possibility of circulatory overload (ie, left atrial hypertension) be ruled out. Once circulatory overload has been excluded, however, the consensus definition of TRALI 11 allows for a diagnosis of \"possible\" TRALI to be made in cases in which patients have other risk factors for ALI temporally 90 VAMVAKAS AND BLAJCHMAN related to the transfusion. 11 The latter include sepsis, aspiration, pneumonia, toxic inhalation, lung contusion, near drowning, multiple trauma, burn injury, acute pancreatitis, cardiopulmonary bypass, and drug overdose. Transfusion-related acute lung injury has a clinical presentation mirroring ARDS 50-52 after ABT. 10, 11, 125 In contrast to ARDS, however, patients with TRALI typically recover with resolution of their pulmonary infiltrates within 96 hours, and the case fatality ratio is only 5% to 10%. 2 To avoid (1) spurious associations between TRALI and transfusions of blood components collected from female donors or donors with circulating WBC antibodies, or (2) a diagnostic suspicion bias for TRALI when WBC-antibody tests on female donors show WBC antibodies in the plasma of a donor(s) of a component(s) given to a patient with ALI in the presence of other risk factors for ALI (Fig 8) , the diagnosis of TRALI is to be made solely on the basis of the clinical presentation, regardless of what laboratory tests follow and their results. 11 The incidence of TRALI is unknown because a standardized definition 10,11 has not been available until relatively recently. Early reports quoted an incidence of 1 per 5000 transfused blood components, 2 with subsequent reports ranging from 1 per 432 platelet pools 42 to 1 per 557 000 RBCs. 15 TRALI has been reported with the use of all types of blood components. Most blood components implicated in published case-reports and small caseseries have contained more than 50 mL of plasma, and FFP has been the most frequently implicated component. 2,126,127 However, TRALI also occurs with whole-blood-derived platelets 128-132 and with components containing as little as 10 mL of plasma. 133 Importantly, not all the pre-2004 literature had indicated that FFP or components containing large volumes of plasma are the principal culprits. 17, 42 Theories of TRALI pathogenesis. Transfusionrelated acute lung injury can be due to WBC antibodies, soluble biologic response mediators accumulating during the storage of cellular blood components, or other still unidentified agents contained in transfused blood components. 10 The WBC antibodies in transfused plasma can be directed against the recipient's WBC antigens and interact with antigens on the patient's WBCs in the microcirculation of the lungs. 2,5 Neutrophil-specific antibodies, especially antibody to the human neutrophil antigen-3a, appear to be relevant. [134] [135] [136] [137] Nonetheless, the presence of a WBC antibody in a donor does not predict the occurrence of TRALI in 102 The depicted historical risk represents empirical data from settings 17, 47 in which all febrile reactions to platelets were monitored and cultured. 102 The estimates of current risk are based on the assumption that all whole blood-derived platelets distributed in the United States will soon be prestorage-pooled and cultured. For estimates of risk in the contemporary (October 2009) setting-when surrogate methods (rather than bacterial culture) are usually used to screen pooled whole blood-derived platelets for bacteria-see Vamvakas. 102 91 TRANSFUSION-RELATED MORTALITY the recipient. 138 Most WBC antibody infusions do not cause TRALI, making it possible that alloantibodies-albeit present in most TRALI casescould be a surrogate for another etiologic factor. The clinical evidence that relates TRALI to WBC antibodies can indeed be explained by such spurious associations as those shown in Figure 8 , and the link between TRALI and WBC antibodies remains circumstantial. 139 In support of the antibody hypothesis of TRALI pathogenesis, the infusion of WBC antibodies in an ex vivo animal model precipitated TRALI in the absence of other factors precipitating TRALI. 140 More specifically, a crossover RCT in 105 ICU patients showed impaired pulmonary function occurring more frequently in patients receiving FFP from multiparous women vs controls. 142 After the conversion to male-only FFP in the United Kingdom, a before and after observational study in multitranfused patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair demonstrated a reduced risk of hypoxia when only male-only FFP was administered. 143 A prospective observational study comparing 55 recipients of male-only FFP with 27 recipients of \"mixed\" (ie, both male and female) FFP in Japan 144 observed development of pulmonary distress-defined as a PaO 2 /fraction of 13 and multitransfused patients are likely to have received some blood components from previously pregnant female donors, such recipients will be likely found to have received components from donors whose plasma contains WBC antibodies, regardless of whether TRALI is (or is not) present. Therefore, female donors and WBC antibodies are likely to be spuriously associated with TRALI when the results of such laboratory tests are considered in making the diagnosis. Such spurious associations may have been the origin of TRALI in some of the cases included in series compiled by blood suppliers on the basis of passive surveillance reports received from hospitals when the recipient's serum was no longer obtainable. For these reasons, the consensus criteria 11 require that the diagnosis of TRALI be made clinically, without considering the results of laboratory tests. Provided that the diagnosis of TRALI has been made in this manner, 11 the further designation of alloimmune TRALI should be reserved for cases of proven WBC incompatibility between an implicated donor and the relevant cognate recipient WBC antigen. In the case of common WBC antigens (and antibodies), even WBC incompatibility between an implicated donor(s) and the recipient can occur by chance. Thus, although such WBC incompatibility strengthens the belief in the correctness of the diagnosis in the appropriate clinical setting, it should not be used as the basis for the diagnosis.",

Initial insult to the vascular endothelium (due to infection, surgery, trauma, or massive transfusion) attracts and primes neutrophils that adhere to the endothelium. A second \"hit\" is then mediated by biologic response modifiers contained in transfused plasma (eg, lipid-priming molecules found in the plasma supernatant of stored [as opposed to fresh] RBCs and platelets, cytokines, CD40 ligand, and/or WBC antibodies). These molecules activate the sequestered neutrophils to release oxidases and proteases that damage the endothelium and produce capillary leak and ALI. A rat model demonstrated that TRALI is the result of 2 events; the first is the clinical condition of the patient and the second consists of antibodies that prime neutrophils and/or plasma from stored blood. 45 The findings of the completed prospective observational studies 43,144 (which underscored the role of patient-related factors) are also consistent with this 2-hit (or bioactive-lipid/neutrophil-priming) hypothesis.",

Such an approach to the diagnosis may explain the very high prevalence of WBC antibodies (as well as the female sex of the donors of the implicated blood components 13 ; Fig 8) in the pre-2004 literature on TRALI. Accordingly, the Canadian consensus criteria 11 permit the diagnosis of \"possible\" TRALI in patients who have other risk factors for ALI yet the clinical setting makes the diagnosis of TRALI likely. If the consensus criteria 11 are not adhered to, however, many clinicians and laboratorians will be dissuaded from making a diagnosis of TRALI either in the absence of donor WBC antibodies or in the presence of alternate risk factors for ALI.

            "text": "Approaches to TRALI prevention. The Canadian Consensus Panel 11 noted that the 2 hypotheses for the cause of TRALI suggest different strategies for prevention. The antibody hypothesis 2,5 supports the exclusion of plasma from donors with pathogenic antibodies, whereas the bioactive-lipid/neutrophil-priming hypothesis 44,45 supports a reduction in the length of storage or the washing of cellular blood components regardless of donor characteristics. The Consensus Panel 11 noted that both preventive strategies have the potential to reduce the blood supply by excluding safe donors (in accordance with the antibody hypothesis of TRALI pathogenesis) or safe products (in accordance with the bioactive-lipid/neutrophil-priming hypothesis). Hitherto, no country appears to have implemented a reduction in the length of storage or the washing of cellular blood components to reduce the risk of TRALI. 145 Following the United Kingdom, several European countries as well as the United States and Canada 146 converted to male-only FFP as a risk reduction strategy. These countries, however, have yet to convert to a single-donor platelet supply collected solely from male donors (or female donors without a history of pregnancy or shown not to have WBC antibodies). 147 The US Leukocyte Antibody Prevalence Study enrolled 5700 female donors, 1100 transfused male donors, and 1100 nontransfused male donors, and it used a validated questionnaire to elicit a history of all pregnancies, including miscarriages and terminations. 13 The HLA antibodies were detected in 24.4% of females with a history of pregnancy, 1.7% of females who had never been pregnant, 1.0% of nontransfused males, and 1.7% of transfused males. Females who had never been pregnant, nontransfused males, and transfused males had the same prevalence of HLA antibodies. Transfusion alone did not result in increased prevalence of HLA antibodies. However, the time since the last transfusion in the donors enrolled in the Leukocyte Antibody Prevalence Study was very long (a median of 22 years). The study did not evaluate recently transfused donors who might have circulating HLA antibodies even if such antibodies fall to undetectable levels in a matter of months after ABT. 147 The reason for the 1.0% and 1.7%, respectively, prevalence of HLA antibodies in nontransfused males and never-pregnant females is uncertain. They could represent false-positive results, antibodies cross-reacting with bacterial antigens, or immunization associated with vaccination. 147 Impact of the Canadian 2004 Consensus Criteria on diagnoses of TRALI. The United Kingdom SHOT system has not been using the Canadian consensus criteria 11 for diagnosing TRALI, thereby, perhaps excluding cases in which WBC antibodies are not demonstrated or relegating them to a \"possible TRALI\" category. 148 Similarly, 2 years after the publication of the consensus definition, 11 45% to 66% of US hospitals were basing their diagnoses of TRALI on a combination of clinical and serologic findings. 149 Workups regularly included HLA class I and II antibodies and sometimes neutrophil antibodies as well. Which donors were screened for WBC antibodies often hinged on a donor's sex, and policies bearing on the diagnosis of TRALI were decided on a case-by-case basis. Figure 8 shows how this (historic) approach to the diagnosis would have produced associations of female sex and WBC antibodies with clinical diagnoses of TRALI as well as reports of TRALI in the pre-2004 literature. Even in the recent literature, however, the Canadian consensus definition has not been consistently adhered to. For example, in a recent RCT 150 of the efficacy of WBC-reduced blood components in preventing TRALI, none of the diagnoses of TRALI assigned in either arm of the trial pertained to ALI occurring within 6 hours of ABT. 151 Because ALI is very common in critically ill multitransfused patients, many cases of ALI can be misdiagnosed as \"TRALI\" because of a temporal association with the transfusion. The demonstration of WBC incompatibility between an implicated donor and the recipient (as opposed to the mere presence of WBC antibodies in an implicated donor's serum) strengthens the evidence that a particular case of ALI (in which all consensus criteria 11 have been met and the diagnosis of TRALI has been made before the laboratory workup) represents TRALI. However, whether TRALI is mediated by its own pathogenetic mechanisms (distinct from the generic mechanisms of ALI) remains unknown. 152 Even when the Canadian consensus criteria 11 are adhered to, a diagnosis of TRALI represents best clinical judgment rather than a firm diagnosis buttressed by a pathognomonic diagnostic test. This is because the criteria 11 are broad and subjective, and they do not specify how the principal differential diagnosis of TACO is to be made from TRALI in routine clinical settings. The subjective nature of the diagnosis is highlighted when clinically and serologically \"documented\" cases of TRALI not meeting the consensus definition are reported. 153 Forty-nine cases of TRALI were diagnosed in the Netherlands between January 2005 and July 2007, by both adhering strictly to the Canadian consensus criteria and performing a complete TRALI workup (which included both tests for WBC antibodies in the sera of all implicated donors and a WBC incompatibility test between the implicated donors and the recipient). 148 Of 49 patients, 44 underwent such complete laboratory workups the purpose of which was not to make the diagnosis of TRALI per se but to identify the subcategory of cases of \"alloimmune\" TRALI. In 36 cases (73.5%), at least one implicated donor had WBC antibodies. In 21 cases (43%), serologic incompatibility was demonstrated between at least one donor and the recipient (ie, the donor's antibody was directed against a cognate WBC antigen of the recipient).",

Seventy-four patients developed TRALI. Of these, 62% had another risk factor for ALI, highlighting the interaction between ABT, patient factors, and development of TRALI. This finding underscores the risk of ARDS (diagnosed as either ALI or TRALI) in critically ill patients with preexisting risk factors of ALI who receive transfusion of even a single-unit of blood. 157 Gajic et al 43 compared the 74 TRALI cases to 74 controls drawn from among the patients who did not develop worsening respiratory status within 24 hours of the ABT. The cases received more units from female donors and donors with more pregnancies, as well as more FFP and FFP from female donors with more pregnancies.

The WBC antibodies were not associated with TRALI in the multivariate analysis that included the various patient-related risk factors for ALI, yet the most straightforward opportunity for TRALI prevention would be the exclusion of female donors from making donations of FFP.

            "text": "In HTRs, the transfused donor RBCs are attacked by the recipient's \"naturally occurring\" antibodies to ABO antigens, and/or antibodies to other RBC antigens, produced after immunization through a previous transfusion or pregnancy. An acute HTR occurs within 24 hours of the ABT, although-in the case of an ABO-incompatible transfusion-it usually begins during the transfusion. A delayed HTR (DHTR) begins after there has been an anamnestic (secondary) immune response to a donor RBC antigen to which the recipient has been alloimmunized by a previous transfusion or pregnancy. From 19.5% to 48.6% of clinically significant RBC alloantibodies to non-ABO antigens disappear over time, predisposing a transfusion recipient to the development of DHTR. 158 It is very rare for a DHTR to cause death, although deaths have been reported. 4, 159 The outcome of an 95 TRANSFUSION-RELATED MORTALITY immediate HTR depends on the potency of the (usually ABO) recipient antibody and the volume of blood transfused; infusion rate may also be a factor. Most fatalities have been associated with transfusions of 200 mL or more, and mortality approaches 44% for transfusions exceeding 1000 mL. 4, 18 Of 44 fatalities reported to the FDA because of HTR in 1976 to 1978, 38 were due to ABO incompatibility. 18 The commonest cause of HTR was the failure to identify the intended recipient correctly, and most such incorrect blood component transfusions had occurred in the operating room. Of the deaths reported to the FDA (1976-1985) , 4 160 This is identical to the figure calculated from French hemovigilance data 14 (1 per 1.8 million transfused RBCs; 95% CI, 1 per 5 million to 1 per 773 000) and similar to the figure of 1 per 1.4 million components issued for transfusion obtained from the SHOT system. 15 Deaths from ABO HTRs. Proper identification of the transfusion recipient (at the time of transfusion) and of the pretransfusion blood specimen (at the time of specimen collection) are critical for the prevention of ABO HTRs. It is human error that causes transfusion of the wrong unit or miscollection (or mislabeling) of the pretransfusion specimen. Therefore, administrative systems have been developed to analyze errors and prevent their future recurrence. 161 Moreover, because proper identification of the transfusion recipient is crucial, barrier systems intended to physically prevent the transfusion of blood without correct identification of the patient have been devised. These include a plastic lock that must be unlocked by the entry of the correct identification code, 162 use of a special wristband for identification of transfusion recipients, 163,164 multiple barcodes (on patient wristbands, blood sample tubes, blood component bags, and nurses' identification badges) along with point-of-transfusion reading devices to verify identity, 165,166 as well as other similar approaches. 167, 168 These tools require investment in information technology, but they can be integrated with other systems such as medication administration. To guard against miscollection (or mislabeling) of the pretransfusion specimen, some US transfusion services require verification of the recipient's ABO group by the collection of 2 independent pretransfusion samples. 169 Figure 9 shows a reduction in these avoidable deaths from ABO HTRs reported to the US FDA between 1976 to 1985 and 2005 to 2008. The recent decrease in deaths 1 was temporally associated with the February 2004 FDA requirement that machinereadable information be included on blood container labels by April 2006. 170 A similar reduction in ABO-related fatalities was recently recorded by the United Kingdom SHOT system. 16 Deaths from non-ABO HTRs. Despite the reduction in ABO fatalities, the mean annual number of all deaths from acute HTRs has remained stable between 1976 to 1985 (15.8/y) and 2005 to 2008 (14.0/y) (Fig 9) . This is because reported fatalities due to acute HTRs secondary to non-ABO antibodies have increased in recent years. 1 The increasing number of such reports to the FDA probably reflects improved awareness of the potential for non-ABO HTRs to cause death. In 2005 to 2008, non-ABO antibodies were implicated in 60.7% of all fatal HTRs. 1 Implicated RBC antibodies included Jk b , Jk a , Kell, Fy a , Fy b , E, Js a , I, as well as multiple antibody specificities.

However, hematooncology patients experience multiple transfusion events in a short period, which probably causes overestimation of the number of transfusions needed for additional antibody formation in hemato-oncology patients, as compared with obstetrical, surgical, and other medical patients.",

To prevent such problems, the standard of care has been elevated at many US hospitals for patients with hemoglobinopaties. 179 These multiply-transfused patients receive units matched for the C, E, and K (and sometimes also for the Jk a and Fy a ) antigens, for preventing the formation of alloantibodies to these antigens. 179-182 Such extended antigen matching between donor and recipient is generally performed phenotypically, that is, using the traditional serologic techniques of hemagglutination. 173 A driving force for doing extended antigen matching for patients with hemoglobinopathies has been the difference between donor and recipient phenotypes due to ethnic-pool gene diversity. 183, 184 Extended phenotypic antigen matching is generally not performed for other multiply-transfused patients either because the clinical benefit from such an elevated standard of care has not been empirically documented or because the additional effort generated by the extended phenotypic matching is considered to be prohibitive. Genotyping for C, E, K, Jk a , Fy a , and other clinically significant RBC antigens is now available, however, and it can be performed on patients as well as donor units (using DNA extracted from the residual WBCs in WBC-reduced RBC units). 185-189 The feasibility of providing extended antigen matching between donor and recipient through genotyping was recently demonstrated in a multicenter US study for several categories of patients (in addition to patients with sickle cell disease). 190 This study used random-donor units from existing inventories, and it used a computerized inventory management system to create and maintain an inventory of genotyped units, as well as identify compatible blood for transfusion recipients at increasingly stringent levels of antigen matching.",

Irradiation always prevents GVHD, yet sporadic cases do occur. In 1996 to 1999, 12 fatal cases were captured by the SHOT system (4/y), 15, 16 although there has been only 1 further case after universal WBC reduction was implemented. 191 Of the 13 cases, 2 patients were not known to be immunocompromised at the time of their transfusion; 6 had B-cell malignancies not listed as an indication for irradiation in the United Kingdom, and 5 were apparently immunocompetent (although there may have been partial haplotype sharing between donor and recipient). 15 A higher risk of TA-GVHD has been reported from Japan where the population is racially homogeneous and likely to share HLA haplotypes. Four of 847 patients receiving fresh (b7-day-old) blood for cardiac surgery developed TA-GVHD. 192 Rososhansky et al 193 estimated that 1 per 2000 patients transfused in the United States may share an HLA haplotype(s) with a donor. This figure is far higher than the reported number of TA-GVHD cases, perhaps because blood transfused in the United States is more than 7-day-old and does not contain viable lymphocytes. Some hospitals (especially cancer and pediatric centers) irradiate all blood transfused to their patients because (1) patients at risk for TA-GVHD may not receive irradiated blood due to errors, (2) there is no consensus on the list of conditions that render a patient at risk for TA-GVHD, 194 and (3) some apparently immunocompetent patients do develop TA-GVHD. The WBC-reduced components do not eliminate the risk of TA-GVHD, although it may be possible to develop WBC reduction technologies in the future capable of doing so. 195",

[223] [224] [225] Consequently, an excess production of reactive oxygen species in subjects from the liberal transfusion arm (who received 3 more RBC units, or 600 mg of extra iron, compared with a total body iron of 2.8 g) may have worsened the preexisting oxidative stress. 225 39 For each comparison, the figure shows the OR of an adverse outcome in patients from the restrictive (compared with the liberal) transfusion strategy arm. Each OR is surrounded by its 95% CI. When the 95% CIs include the null value of 1, the corresponding OR is not statistically significant (ie, P N .05). Of 22 categorial comparisons reported by the authors, only the number of organs failing (N3 vs b3), septic shock, catheterrelated sepsis, and pneumonia occurred less frequently in the liberal (compared with the restrictive) strategy arm. The differences were minimal, with only the difference in septic shock approaching a trend (P = .13). All other differences in categorical outcomes favored the restrictive strategy arm. Differences in any cardiac complication (P b .01), myocardial infarction (P = .02), and pulmonary edema (P b .01) were statistically significant, whereas the difference in ARDS (P = .06) approached significance. Five more outcomes were analyzed as continuous variables, and they all favored the restrictive strategy arm. Three of these differences were minimal, but the differences in adjusted MODS (P = .03) and for the change from baseline score (P = .04) were statistically significant.",

These investigators undertook another RCT that confirmed the association between ABT and short-term mortality but did not find an association between non-WBC-reduced ABT and increased MOF. 31 In the late 1990s, the United Kingdom, Canada, and several other countries implemented universal WBC reduction of cellular blood components by means of prestorage filtration, permitting \"before and after\" comparisons of the mortality of recipients of non-WBC-reduced RBCs before implementation of WBC reduction with the mortality of recipients of WBC-reduced RBCs after implementation of WBC reduction.

This hypothesis was buttressed by the findings of a companion before and after study in premature infants. 228 In that setting, the implementation of universal WBC reduction coincided with a reduction in several secondary morbidity outcomes from several organ systems (ie, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis)-an observation consistent with a diffuse proinflammatory microvascular effect of allogeneic WBCs (or their products). In contrast to these observations, however, a meta-analysis of all available before and after studies found neither an unadjusted nor an adjusted association of WBC reduction with decreased short-term mortality. 229 Eleven RCTs comparing recipients of non-WBC-reduced vs WBC-reduced allogeneic RBCs have presented information on short-term (up to 3 months posttransfusion) mortality from all causes. 30-32,230-237 Across 5 RCTs conducted in cardiac surgery 30-32,234,236 that had transfused RBCs filtered before storage to the non-WBCreduced arm, non-WBC-reduced (vs WBC-reduced) ABT was associated with a 72% increase in postoperative mortality (summary OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.05-2.81; P b .05). 238 In contrast, across 6 RCTs conducted in other settings, 230-233,235,236 non-WBC-reduced (vs WBC-reduced) ABT was not associated with any increase in postoperative mortality. 238 The adverse effect seen across these open heart surgery studies 30-32,234,236 may be associated with factors prevalent in the setting of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",

However, based on the existing findings, 39 physicians should endeavor to limit their patients' exposure to ABT by administering RBC transfusions to raise the hemoglobin level only when a patient's hemoglobin level falls to 7 g/dL or less (provided that the patient is not actively bleeding and does not have ischemic heart disease). Once a hemoglobin level of more than 7 g/ dL (with a maintenance hemoglobin level of 7-9 g/ dL in the TRICC RCT 39 ) has been reached through ABT, further RBC transfusion(s) should be withheld unless a patient has symptoms or signs relating to the anemia. This is because the TRICC RCT 39 unambiguously demonstrated that transfusion for a hemoglobin target level of less than 7 g/dL is as good as transfusion for a hemoglobin target level of less than 10 g/dL (with a maintenance hemoglobin level of 10-12 g/dL) in the absence of symptoms or signs of anemia (Fig 11) . In the analysis of all patients, there were no statistically significant (P b .05) differences between the arms other than for the adjusted MODS (and difference from the baseline score), as well as the development of myocardial infarction and pulmonary edema. All 4 significant differences favored the restrictive strategy arm. Moreover, with the sole exception of septic shock (Fig 11) , all observed trends favored the restrictive strategy arm as well. Compared with the liberal strategy arm, the patients in the restrictive strategy arm consistently demonstrated better clinical outcomes in mortality, MOF, length of stay in the hospital or the ICU, organ-specific complications, or any studied complication. 39 Admittedly, the TRICC RCT 39 left open the possibility that both trial arms might have had a worse outcome than would have been the case had a third, \"standard-of-care\" arm also been included, that is, an arm in which physicians would have been allowed to use their own judgment to transfuse for a hemoglobin target level of between less than 7 g/dL and less than 10 g/dL based on their assessment of each patient's clinical presentation. 248, 249 This possibility remains to be examined in future RCTs, including the recently completed Functional Outcomes in Cardiovascular Patients Undergoing Surgical Hip Fracture Repair (FOCUS) transfusion trigger trial. 250 The pilot study for the FOCUS RCT showed no difference in mortality between the liberal and restrictive transfusion strategy arms. 251 Except for the TRICC RCT 39 and the pilot for the FOCUS trial, 251 there are no RCTs evaluating RBC transfusion triggers in adult patients. Therefore, at the time of this writing and for clinically stable adult patients, there is no evidence from RCTs that a \"liberal\" transfusion strategy (administration of blood transfusion for a hemoglobin level falling lower than any target value N7 g/dL) confers any benefit to patients compared with a \"restrictive\" transfusion strategy (administration of RBC",

In contrast to the overall results of the TRICC RCT 39 (which showed a trend toward reduced mortality in patients randomized to the restrictive strategy arm), the subgroup analysis of 257 patients with ischemic heart disease showed a trend toward reduced mortality in the liberal strategy arm. 252 For this reason, the FOCUS RCT 250 enrolled 2600 patients to determine whether subjects with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors undergoing surgical repair of hip fracture benefit from a higher (b10 g/dL) vs lower (b8 g/dL) transfusion trigger. When the findings of FOCUS are finally presented, it is to be hoped that they will end the debate whether the recommendation 253 to use RBC transfusion to maintain hemoglobin levels greater than 10 g/dL in high-risk patients should be adhered to. The rationale 253 for transfusing patients with impaired ventricular function to a hemoglobin level more than 10 g/dL has been that the lack of compensatory increase in cardiac output leaves ABT as the only means to increase oxygen delivery postoperatively.",

The composite outcome consisted of death before discharge from the hospital, survival with severe retinopathy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and/or brain injury on cranial ultrasound. 254 Owing to multiple exclusion criteria, the neonates enrolled in the Premature Infants in Need of Transfusion trial 254 may have had a \"better-thanaverage\" prognosis. Recently, these same infants had their neurodevelopmental outcomes assessed at 18 to 21 months of age. 255 There was no statistical difference in the primary outcome (death or presence of cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, or severe visual or hearing impairment), which was found in 45% of the infants from the restrictive arm and 38% of the infants from the liberal arm. There was also no difference in any of the preplanned secondary outcomes. However, the difference in cognitive delay (Mental Development Index score of b70) approached statistical significance. A post hoc analysis, with the Mental Development Index score redefined as b85, showed a statistically significant difference favoring the liberal strategy arm. 255 A small US RCT enrolling 100 infants with a birth weight of between 0.5 and 1.3 kg concluded that infants in the restrictive strategy arm were more likely to have intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia, and they also had more frequent episodes of both mild and severe apnea. 256 These conclusions, however, were based on a very small number of events (with 0 vs 4 and 0 vs 6 infants, respectively, having grade IV brain hemorrhage or grade IV brain hemorrhage and/or periventricular leukomalacia) and any benefit from a liberal transfusion strategy needs to be investigated further in future RCTs.",

Conversely, with a platelet count of greater than 50 000/\u03bcL, the available observational studies suggest that an INR of less than 3 is adequate for performing these procedures without the need for a prophylactic plasma transfusion. 241 There are no data from RCTs, however, to support the safety of such conservative transfusion 106 VAMVAKAS AND BLAJCHMAN triggers, and thus, liberal transfusion guidelines for prophylactic platelet and FFP transfusions are used at many US institutions, in accordance with available (published) transfusion guidelines.

In the absence of such reports, active surveillance studies 2,42 conducted at sentinel sites that transfuse both singledonor and pooled whole-blood-derived platelets can be informative. Until such data are reported, however, it is impossible to reach any definitive conclusion about the relative risk of TRALI in association with single-donor vs pooled whole blood-derived platelets from the available conflicting databases. 102 If our current single-donor and pooled whole blood-derived platelets are associated with an approximately equal risk of TRALI (Table 3) 102,108 and single-donor platelets in the future are collected solely from male donors or female donors without a history of pregnancy or shown not to have WBC antibodies, these future single-donor platelets should be associated with a lower risk of TRALI than our current pooled whole blood-derived platelets. A mathematical model 108 considered that the TRALI risk associated with future single-donor platelets (collected from male donors or appropriately screened female donors) would be 40% to 80% lower than the risk of TRALI associated with our current single-donor or pooled whole bloodderived platelets. Because TRALI is the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality in the United States today (Figs 1 and 2) , moving to an all-apheresis platelet supply that would rely exclusively on male donors or female donors without a history of pregnancy or shown not to have WBC antibodies would be a major improvement in transfusion safety, replicating to some extent the success story presumably realized by the conversion to male-only FFP (Figs 5 and 6) . It was recently estimated that the exclusion of female donors who have circulating WBC antibodies would result in a loss of only 6% of our current US plateletpheresis donors. 147 It should thus be possible, through donor recruitment efforts, to both replace this small percentage of our current plateletpheresis donors and attract additional plateletpheresis donors to harvest the 12.5% of therapeutic platelet doses that continue to be provided as pooled whole blood-derived platelets in the United States.",

The counterargument relates to the magnitude of the expected benefit and consequently to the costbenefit ratio associated with genotype technology vs other technologies discussed in this review (as well as others) and other necessary functions presently vying for our resources. 175 For patients with sickle cell disease, the higher standard of care can be justified because the inflammatory response associated with the transfusion reaction can provoke sickle cell crisis, stroke, or other severe complications. This considerable benefit does not apply to the alloimmunized hematooncology patients (or other alloimmunized transfusion recipients) for whom extended antigen matching is intended to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with acute and delayed HTRs.

Moreover, even the PR methods under development could not protect the blood supply from all the emerging agents prioritized by the AABB Task Force. 29 For example, of the agents listed in that report, 29 pathologic prions, human parvovirus B19, and hepatitis A virus would not be inactivated or would probably be inadequately inactivated by PR. It should also be borne in mind that the very concept of emerging infections is that their evolution and manifestations, as well as the properties of the associated pathogen, are intrinsically unpredictable. This is because PR procedures are almost always validated against transfusion-transmitted agents that are already known. 276 Thus, emerging infections may be neither inactivated by PR nor associated with specific high-risk groups whose deferral from blood donation could prevent transmission to transfusion recipients. The latter would be the case if the next major transfusion-transmitted pathogen to emerge were foodborne (such as vCJD), vector-borne (such as WNV), or even airborne (such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). 102, 277 Therefore, reducing the number of donors to whom a patient is exposed is the only strategy that can reduce the risk of transmission of any TTI that might emerge in the future. 26,102 Most of the success of this strategy depends on the prevention of unnecessary transfusions through the enforcement of evidence-based transfusion guidelines on the hospital side, but a lot can be accomplished on the blood center side as well, by avoiding the distribution of pooled blood products, especially pooled whole blood-derived platelets. 26, 102 To provide the same therapeutic benefit to a recipient that could be obtained from the transfusion of a single-donor platelet concentrate, pooled whole blood-derived platelets expose a patient to 4 to 6 times as many donors as an apheresis product. Table 4 shows the number of cases of TTIs that could be prevented annually in the United States if the United States provided all therapeutic platelet doses transfused to patients in the form of singledonor concentrates.",

Some observers have reasoned that because 12.5% of therapeutic platelet doses con-tinue to be provided as pooled whole bloodderived platelets in the United States, 56 1 to 2 TRALI fatalities ascribed to pooled whole bloodderived platelets should have been passively reported to the FDA between 2004 and 2008 if transfusion of platelet pools was indeed associated with a risk of fatal TRALI. Alternatively, the absence of any such fatalities 1 may be due to chance because such reported deaths represent exceedingly rare events. Yet another explanation could be a lack of TRALI awareness and recognition in environments where pooled whole bloodderived platelets are administered-certainly a possibility because TRALI is known to be grossly underrecognized and underreported. 278 Similarly to TRALI, during the 2004-2008 period-when pooled whole blood-derived platelets were not subjected to bacterial culture but were screened for bacteria by surrogate methods 4.6 times less sensitive than culture 55 -no fatalities from TAS ascribed to the transfusion of pooled whole blood-derived platelets were reported to the US FDA 1 (Fig 13) . During this same period, fatalities from TAS attributed to the transfusion of single-donor platelets continued to be reported (Fig 13) , despite the fact that these latter components had been cultured for bacteria. The absence of reported deaths from both TAS and TRALI in association with the transfusion of pooled whole blood-derived platelets not subjected to culture supports the hypothesis that pooled whole bloodderived platelets in the United States are likely administered in environments with less monitoring of transfusion reactions and less access to transfusion medicine expertise. If that is the case, the differences in the numbers of passively reported deaths associated with the 2 types of platelet components can be ascribed to the \"passive surveillance artifact\" described in the section on sources of data and their interpretation.",

When selective WBC reduction is used, administration of WBC-reduced components to cardiac surgery patients is usually not included among the established indications for WBC reduction. 279 Thus, in some US hospitals, WBC-reduced RBCs are administered routinely to patients whose mortality has not been shown to be affected by WBC reduction, whereas elsewhere cardiac surgery ",

Rather than this \"agent-by-agent\" approach, there should be a more all-encompassing \"proactive\" approach to blood safety that would address most transfusion-transmitted pathogens such as the use of PR by nucleic acid intercalating agents (ie, psoralens and riboflavin) in the presence of ultraviolet light. 23,280-282 These technologies bind the photosensitizing agents to the nucleic acids of pathogens and inactivate them, while permitting the nucleic acid-free constituents of donor blood (plasma proteins, platelets, and RBCs) to continue to function. 280 Thus, these technologies can eliminate most of the residual risks of bacteria as well as the risks associated with a long list of transfusiontransmitted pathogens for which the blood supply is not screened (eg, Plasmodium sp, Babesia sp, and so on). Perhaps more important, these technologies offer potential, preemptive protection against the next potentially lethal transfusion-transmitted agent that will inevitably emerge in the future, replicating the experience with HIV or WNV. 23 Such technologies are currently available for platelets and FFP, have an acceptable safety profile, 283-288 and have already been licensed for use in some Western European countries. 29 Although the safety improvement they confer is widely acknowledged, there is debate as to whether PR for all platelets and plasma should be introduced before suitable PR technologies also become available for RBCs. The contribution of PR to safety can be only suboptimal if PR technology cannot simultaneously also be applied to RBCs, with the latter continuing to transmit pathogens to transfusion recipients. Also, until there is a comprehensive system of PR that also encompasses RBCs, permitting various cost-savings from the possible discontinuation of other safety measures, the cost of PR is bound to be incremental and substantial. 289 However, many patients receive repeated platelet transfusions only intermittently accompanied by RBC transfusions, and-however medically inappropriate 241 -platelet and/or FFP transfusions are often given \"prophylactically\" to patients scheduled to undergo bedside or invasive procedures because of a moderately lowered platelet count or moderately elevated INR.",

Despite this plausible prediction, however, RBC and platelet use has been reported to remain the same before and after the introduction of a pathogen inactivation system in 2 Western European countries. 290, 291 Also, there was no increase in the platelet transfusion needs of patients receiving platelets treated with riboflavin-based PR technologies compared with subjects in the untreated arm of the one reported trial. 292 Potential toxic effects of the candidate PR systems have been examined in many dimensions, 114 VAMVAKAS AND BLAJCHMAN including acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity; blood component incompatibility; genotoxicity; carcinogenicity; and impact on reproduction and development. Although no evidence of such adverse effects has hitherto been adduced, the clinical events of interest are rare and may have very long latent periods before they become recognized, especially regarding mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. 29 These concerns about possible long-term toxicities of PR technologies cannot be alleviated until long-term outcomes are reported from the Western European countries in which PR technologies have been already (at least partly) introduced into clinical practice. These concerns must be considered, however, in the context of the possible additional short-term benefits from PR technologies. Unlike WBC reduction filters that leave up to 5 \u00d7 10 6 residual WBCs behind in each WBC-reduced blood component, PR technologies eliminate all allogeneic WBCs. In this way, they can prevent the rare deaths from TA-GVHD that can occur in patients given unirradiated components by mistake or because they do not have a recognized indication for irradiation. 281 Furthermore, an RCT of the efficacy and safety of platelets that had undergone PR demonstrated a trend toward reduced mortality in the patients supported with treated platelets, concerning especially the mortality from ALI. 293 Acute lung injury is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplantsa setting in which ALI may account for up to 25% to 50% of all deaths. If PR truly renders platelets less apt to cause ALI in transfusion recipients, plausible explanations for this effect would include reduction in cytokine synthesis and/or antigen presentation, owing to the absence of WBCs in the treated products.",

            "text": "Pathogen reduction processes can be applied to either single-unit plasma units or plasma pools. Thus, there are now 4 licensed technologies for PR of plasma in Europe. Most clinical experience (N6 million U transfused) has hitherto been accrued with pooled plasma subjected to solvent-detergent treatment. 288 Pooling of 500 to 2500 plasma donations has the disadvantage that one single plasma unit can contaminate the whole pool. However, this drawback can be offset by several advantages, including the virtual elimination of TRALI attributable to WBC antibodies, a significant reduction in the incidence of allergic reactions owing to dilution of allergens, and standardization of the product for therapeutic use in its coagulation factor content (because individual plasma donors contributing to the pool have a wide range of coagulation factor levels, varying between 50% and 200%). 288, 294, 295 In TRALI reduction, solvent-detergent-treated pooled plasma-which is currently used to meet virtually all the plasma needs of Norway and Ireland and has contributed 464 582 (compared with 650 781 for FFP) transfused units of plasma in France between 2003 and 2006 288 -needs to be compared with the male-only FFP currently being used in North America. The solvent-detergenttreated pooled plasma should be as effective as male-only FFP in reducing the risk of TRALI because the manufacturing process dilutes, and possibly neutralizes, WBC antibodies. 295 In fact, no reports of TRALI have appeared from Western European countries using solvent-detergent-treated pooled plasma. In particular, during the aforementioned period (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) , 288 after the French hemovigilance system started appropriate monitoring for TRALI, there were 14 (9 probable or certain and 5 possible) cases of TRALI in association with transfusion of FFP (1 per 25 346 U), as compared with no case of TRALI in association with transfusion of solvent-detergenttreated pooled plasma. 296, 297 Furthermore, although for most TTIs that would occur in association with the use of solventdetergent-treated pooled plasma, a single contaminated unit might contaminate the entire pool, at least in theory, there can be situations in which pooling offers advantages for preventing transmission of TTIs. 298 Although there are no data on the risk of vCJD infectivity of solvent-detergenttreated pooled plasma, if anything, the low titer of prion infectivity in the blood of an infected individual (approximately 10 infectious U/mL) would be greatly diluted by the thousands of units of plasma in the plasma pool. Subsequent manufacturing processes should also remove prions from the final product. 298 The solvent-detergent treatment of pooled plasma results in appreciable losses of protein S, antitrypsin, and antiplasmin. 288 These losses have generated concern when the product is used in patients with hyperfibrinolysis (such as occurs during the reperfusion stage of liver transplantation).

The current manufacturing process used in Europe is different, resulting in reduced-albeit still appreciable-loss of these 3 proteins. Nonetheless, the Irish-who almost exclusively use solvent-detergent-treated pooled plasma for the plasma needs of their transfusion recipients-do not use this product for patients undergoing liver transplantation. 300 Because it cannot be predicted when the next major transfusion-transmitted pathogen will emerge, we believe that PR technologies for platelets and plasma should be implemented by the transfusion medicine community when they are licensed rather than waiting for PR technologies for RBCs to also be developed, perhaps in the next 5 to 10 years. 282 If the next agent to emerge is an enveloped virus (such as HIV, HBV, HCV, or WNV), a potential future HIV-like epidemic of a fatal transfusion-transmitted infection can be averted. Several safety measures (including bacterial detection in platelets and screening for antibody to Trypanosoma cruzi) could also potentially be discontinued when PR is universally introduced for all blood products. At the same time, however, we recognize the potential for the debate over PR to have a negative effect on safety, by producing a situation of continued inaction vis\u00e0-vis addressing the (residual) risk of bacteria in platelets/TAS and other known infectious risks through the other interventions discussed in this review.",

Accordingly, any impact of the November 2006 AABB recommendations for TRALI prevention8 should be reflected solely on the TRALI cases recorded in 2008 in association with transfusion of FFP.Figure 5shows that the conversion to male-only FFP in the United States was temporally related to a reduction in the number of TRALI deaths associated with FFP transfusion reported to the FDA. The variation in the number of TRALI deaths attributed to FFP reported between 2005 and 2008 could be due to chance or, alternatively, to increasing awareness in 2005 to 2006 of the risk of TRALI specifically associated with FFP transfusion, followed by a reduction in the number of TRALI deaths in 2007 to 2008 when female FFP was gradually replaced by male FFP. Increasing awareness in 2005 to 2006 of the risk of TRALI specifically related to transfusion of FFP is possible-associated with the publicity generated by the conversion to male-only FFP in the United Kingdom in 2003 to 2004, as well as United Kingdom studies of TRALI that had considered as the \"at-risk\" patient population the recipients of solely FFP.57   A reduction in the number of deaths from TRALI had already been observed in the United Kingdom that had gradually moved to male-only FFP in 2003 to 2004, without replacing existing FFP inventories (or mandating 100% compliance with the policy that plasma for transfusion be collected solely from male donors). Awareness of the risk of TRALI in the United Kingdom may have thus preceded that in the United States by approximately 3 years, as did the policy to convert to male-only FFP. After the conversion, the annual number of deaths from TRALI reported to the United Kingdom SHOT system declined(Fig 6)until in 2008, for the first time since reporting to the SHOT system started in 1996, no death from TRALI was recorded in the United Kingdom. There were 3 nonfatal cases of TRALI reported in 2008, and all 3 were due to transfusion of FFP from female donors in England (where the use of male donors for FFP is not yetFig 6.

Although lacking an intermediate avian host that could facilitate its spread to North America and Europe, DFV is transmitted by mosquitoes that are already present in North America, has a median viremia of 5 days, and causes asymptomatic infection in most cases. Two cases of transfusion transmission have been documented, although more have undoubtedly occurred in endemic areas. 61,62 Thus, DFV may well replicate the 2002 epidemic of transfusionacquired WNV infection in North America in the future. Other arboviruses may pose a similar threat. 76 Chickungunya virus caused several outbreaks on islands in the Indian Ocean and in India, and in the summer of 2007, 205 cases of infection (imported by a visitor from India) occurred in Italy where mosquitoes capable of transmitting the virus exist.",
