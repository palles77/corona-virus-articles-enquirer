Seven eight-week-old pigs were cannulated and inoculated, two were cannulated but not inoculated, and two pigs were inoculated but not cannulated. Endoscopy, biopsy, and blood sampling to determine SAA (serum amyloid A), haptoglobin, cortisol, and WBC counts were performed at scheduled time-points. At the third day of disease, endoscopy showed a hyperaemic, perturbed mucosa and excessive amount of mucus. Histologically, crypt hyperplasia, depletion of goblet cell mucus, and erosions were noted. Simultaneously, elevated acute phase proteins and circulating monocytes, and decreased number of intraepithelial CD3 + cells were observed. After five days the pigs recovered. Intestinal lesions were demarcated and interspersed among apparently normal mucosa and blood parameters returned to initial values. Endoscopy through an intestinal cannula made it possible to follow the development of intestinal alterations in vivo and describe the sequential events during the course of swine dysentery. The number of animals used in a study could thus be minimised and the precision of the experiment increased.",

Clinical signs range from mild, mucous diarrhoea and unaltered general condition to severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea with a mortality rate of 50-90% (Moreng et al., 1980; Raynaud et al., 1980; Whipp et al., 1979) . The lesions are confined to the large intestine and vary from mild catarrh to marked inflammation with excessive mucus production, necrosis, haemorrhages and pseudomembranes. Micro-scopically, hyperplastic mucus-filled crypts, goblet cell hyperplasia, and mucosal oedema with congested blood vessels are frequently seen (Albassam et al., 1985; Glock and Harris, 1972; Kinyon et al., 1977) . In progressive cases, superficial erosion and mucofibrinous exudate with neutrophils and debris develop (Albassam et al., 1985; Glock and Harris, 1972) . Initially, the local inflammatory cell response is minimal, but within a few days a mixed population of inflammatory cells appears in the superficial lamina propria. Spirochaetes are sometimes seen lying free in the cytoplasm of goblet cells and enterocytes (Albassam et al., 1985) .",

Opportunists might also exacerbate the lesions (Albassam et al., 1985; Lysons et al., 1984) . Further, the importance and precise role of virulence factors such as chemotaxis, attachment, invasion, endotoxins or toxin production remains to be elucidated (ter Huurne and Gaastra, 1995) . The bacterium is suggested to primarily invade the goblet cells, thereby causing excessive mucus secretion (Pohlenz et al., 1983) . Alternatively, invasion is preceded by initial damage to tight junctions (Kang and Olander, 1990; ter Huurne and Gaastra, 1995) . In addition, the host's immune response might exacerbate the lesions (Hontecillas et al., 2005; Nuessen et al., 1983) .",

The SAA values of the cannulated, noninoculated pigs were below the detection limit of the method (<9.8 mg/L) on all sampling occasions. The haptoglobin values in these pigs ranged from 1.0 to 2.3 g/L throughout the study. In all inoculated pigs (n = 9), SAA was below the detection limit before the start of the study, and the mean haptoglobin concentration was 2.5 \u00b1 0.7 g/L. An increase (p < 0.01) to 185 \u00b1 284 mg/L SAA and to 3.9 \u00b1 1.9 g/L haptoglobin was detected at onset of diarrhoea. When haemorrhagic diarrhoea occurred, a further increase to 710 \u00b1 1012 mg/L SAA (p < 0.01) and 6.0 \u00b1 1.7 g/L haptoglobin (p < 0.001) was seen. Twelve hours after the onset of diarrhoea, the mean values for the 2 pigs that had not yet developed haemorrhagic diarrhoea were 183.6 mg/L for SAA and 4.85 g/L for haptoglobin. Thereafter, the values in all pigs ranged from 22 to >5000 mg/L SAA and from 4.9 to 12.3 g/L haptoglobin during the course of haemorrhagic dysentery. At the start of recovery, a decrease to 64 mg/L SAA (p < 0.05) and 5.4 \u00b1 0.8 g/L haptoglobin (not significant) was seen. At sacrifice, the mean haptoglobin was 5.2 \u00b1 1.5 g/L and the mean SAA was 40 mg/L. Before inoculation, the mean cortisol value was 60 \u00b1 66 nmol/L (range 10-215 nmol/L) in all pigs. In non-inoculated cannulated pigs, the values ranged from 56 to 200 nmol/L during the study. At onset of diarrhoea, the values ranged from 19 to 81 nmol/L. The mean cortisol values peaked on the third day of haemorrhagic diarrhoea with a mean value of 137 \u00b1 88 nmol/L. The differences were not significant. The total and differential white blood cell counts are shown in Table 1 . The total white blood cell count in the non-inoculated, cannulated pigs varied between 10.1 and 28.5 \u00b7 10 9 cells/L during the study, the highest value being recorded prior to the start of the study. In the experimentally inoculated pigs, monocytes increased (p < 0.05) when diarrhoea occurred. A further increase was seen during haemorrhagic diarrhoea (p < 0.001), also reflected in an increase in the total white blood cell counts (p < 0.05). When the pigs started to recover, as judged by their general condition and the consistency and colour of the faeces, the number of monocytes was still increased (p < 0.01). In addition, during the recovery phase, eosinophils increased (p < 0.05). No other differences were observed.",

This was often associated with prominent accumulates of mucins in dilated crypt lumina (Fig. 3f) and on the mucosal surface. Goblet cell hyperplasia, i.e. hyperplastic crypts with almost complete predominance of crowded and intact goblet cells, was seen only in biopsies from the fifth day. The surface epithelium was often pleomorphic and markedly attenuated (Fig. 3e) . Shallow mucosal erosions with sero-and fibrinocellular to haemorrhagic exudates were frequently observed on the first and second biopsy occasions and were abundant in some biopsies (Fig. 3h) .

On histology, the overall cellularity of the lamina propria appeared unchanged compared to controls but the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes was decreased. Superficial erosions were common. Further, the systemic immune response was newly activated. After 1 day, the disease usually aggravated to haemorrhagic diarrhoea with slightly depressed general condition. On the third day, the mucosa was covered by granular yellow debris and haemorrhagic areas with erosions were frequently seen. The crypt length had increased and the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes still decreased. Systemically, an increase in numbers of monocytes and acute phase proteins was noted. Five days after the development of clinical signs, the pigs started to recover; the lesions in the intestine were demarcated and interspersed among areas of apparently normal mucosa. On histology, crypt hyperplasia was still evident and goblet cells in the lower part of the crypts were depleted of mucus. The cellular infiltration in the mucosa was not prominent, and the number of monocytes and levels of SAA and haptoglobin in plasma decreased. After one week, the pigs that had a longer course of disease was clinically recovered with a normal mucosa but crypt hyperplasia and an increased amount of mucus were still evident.",

The lesions in pigs with a moderately to severely depressed condition did not differ macroscopically from lesions in pigs with slightly depressed general behaviour. When viewed by light microscopy, the lesions have been reported to progress from catarrhal to fibrinonecrotic enteritis as the disease progresses (Glock et al., 1974) . Others report that the severity of the lesions does not increase with duration of the disease (Wilcock and Olander, 1979) . Crypt hyperplasia is a consistent feature of the disease (Glock et al., 1974; Wilcock and Olander, 1979) . In the present study, it seemed that crypt hyperplasia was more marked after a few days of diarrhoea and goblet cell hyperplasia became prominent on the fifth and seventh day after the development of diarrhoea. Crypt elongation has been reported to be caused by increased regeneration of cells in areas with surface necrosis (Wilcock and Olander, 1979) . However, in the present study crypt hyperplasia was found independently of erosions, as also reported by Jensen et al. (1998) . Among infected pigs, the crypt length found at necropsy was generally increased, as compared to the length measured in the biopsies. The significance of this is unclear but may be caused by mucosal contraction when the biopsy was gripped (van der Gaag and Happ\u00e9, 1990) . Some authors have suggested that the disease begins with acute necrosis of the surface epithelium induced by toxin production (Albassam et al., 1985; Hughes et al., 1975) . However, mucosal erosions were not a consistent feature in the biopsies of the early diarrhoeic phase in the present study. The depletion of mucus from the goblet cells in the basal part of the crypts is commonly reported (Lysons et al., 1984; Pohlenz et al., 1983; Wilcock and Olander, 1979) , however, it is unclear whether this results from an increased expulsion of mucus or by diminished mucigen formation in immature proliferating goblet cells (Wilcock and Olander, 1979) . Goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus hypersecretion was prominent in later stages, as also reported by Lysons et al. (1984) but in contrast to Glock et al. (1974) , who regarded this as pronounced feature of the early course of the disease. In the present study, the overall cellularity of the lamina propria did not appear to be altered. This is consistent with Hughes et al. (1975) and Albassam et al. (1985) , who reported that the initial local inflammatory cell response was minor but that numerous macrophages and neutrophils were present in response to necrosis in later stages.",

In previous studies, SAA peaked the first day and haptoglobin the second day after surgery (Jacobson et al., 2001) . Taken together, this suggests that the acute phase response to swine dysentery was induced in response to intestinal lesions. The pig that never developed haemorrhagic diarrhoea had histological mucosal erosions in the first and second endoscopy during overt disease and concomitantly increased levels of SAA and haptoglobin (data not shown).",

In addition, the increase of the two proteins was not always correlated. However, ceasing to eat was associated with very high levels of one or both of the acute phase proteins studied (SAA > 5000 mg/L and haptoglobin 12.1 g/L, respectively). Thus, there seems to be an individual variation in the magnitude of the response, probably related to various expressions of the cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 that are main inducers of haptoglobin and SAA (Jacobson et al., 2004; Mackiewicz et al., 1991; Uhlar and Whitehead, 1999) . These cytokines are referred to as endogenous pyrogens and act on the temperature-regulating centre in hypothalamus (Mims et al., 2001) . Thus, an elevated body temperature might be expected. Hughes et al. (1975) reported an increase of body temperature of 1.1-1.7\u00b0C during experimentally induced dysentery. However, except for one pig with a peak haptoglobin of 9.1 g/L correlated to a body temperature of 40.6\u00b0C, no increase in body temperature was recorded in the present study. Thus, fever does not seem to be a prominent feature of swine dysentery.",

Possibly, alterations in the intestinal environment caused by dietary changes such as inclusion of large quantities of soybean meal might produce favourable conditions for the bacteria, allowing it to multiply and induce clinical signs of disease. Alternatively, an imbalance in the intestinal eco-system causes the expulsion of the bacteria allowing it to be detected in the faeces.",
