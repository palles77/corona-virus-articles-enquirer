            "text": "Clinical disease is associated with rapid bacterial overgrowth within the gastrointestinal tract and subsequent exotoxin release. Although limited tissue invasion by C perfringens does occur, most local and systemic lesions result from the effects of potent exotoxins produced by certain genotypes of these bacteria. C perfringens is a large, gram-positive, anaerobic bacillus that exists ubiquitously in the environment and in the gastrointestinal tract of most mammals. 3, [5] [6] [7] [8] There are 5 defined types, or genotypes, of C perfringens: A, B, C, D, and E ( Table 1) . These genotypes are identified based on the lethal toxins that they produce: C perfringens alpha (CPA), C perfringens beta (CPB), epsilon (ETX), and C perfringens iota (CPI). [7] [8] [9] [10] The alpha toxin gene (plc) is present on the chromosome of all C perfringens isolates. 7, 8 All genotypes produce alpha toxin, although isolates differ significantly in the amount of alpha toxin produced. 11, 12 The other lethal toxins, CPB (cpb gene), ETX (etx gene), and CPI (iap/ibp genes) are contained on transferrable plasmids. 7, 8 Two other toxins, enterotoxin (C perfringens enterotoxin [CPE] , cpe gene) and the beta-2 toxin (CPB2, cpb2 gene), are also carried on transferable plasmids in livestock isolates. Enterotoxin can be expressed by any of the subtypes if the plasmid containing this gene (cpe) is present, but it is not required for pathogenicity. Enterotoxin is not released by vegetative bacteria but only in sporulating C perfringens cells during lysis of the vegetative cell. 7 Thus, the toxin may not be present in intestinal contents of animals with C perfringens enteritis unless sporulation is occurring. The beta-2 toxin may be produced by type A as well as by some isolates of types B, C, and E. 13 Strains of C perfringens that carry the beta-2 toxin gene have been isolated from a variety of species of domestic animals, including horses, camelids, cattle, and swine. 13, 14 The genotype, and thus the specific subtype of C perfringens, can be determined by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) that detects the specific toxin genes carried by an individual isolate. Because the clinical and pathologic presentations of diseases caused by C perfringens types are not always distinct, anaerobic culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping of the isolates can be instrumental in determining the subtype involved and can help identify specific control measures. Each of the subtypes of C perfringens is associated with specific disease syndromes that are directly or indirectly related to the toxins they produce. The term enterotoxemia is often loosely used to describe enteric or systemic disease caused by any of the C perfringens toxinotypes. The term enterotoxemia refers to systemic disease caused by absorption of a toxin from the intestine. Clostridial abomasitis and enteritis does not require absorption of the toxins. The term enterotoxemia is best reserved for cases in which systemic disease is associated with absorption of bacterial exotoxins, including hemolytic diseases in lambs with C perfringens type A, and systemic disorders caused by the epsilon toxin of C perfringens types B and D. Some of the disease conditions described for C perfringens are listed in Table 2 . 15 Abdominal tympany Abomasal ulceration Mucosal necrosis and hemorrhage Dietary factors, milk quality, and storage may predispose to disease Enteritis (swine) 16 Found in both diseased and normal pigs ",

            "text": "The C perfringens exotoxins are all polypeptides that generally act by phospholipase damage to the plasma membrane or by forming pores or channels in the plasma membrane of host cells. 8 This process results in cellular membrane disruption and cell leakage of electrolytes or water. The alpha toxin gene is expressed from the chromosome of all C perfringens subtypes. 7, 8 The genes encoding the other toxins are carried on large plasmids. 7, 8 The enterotoxin gene can be either chromosomal or plasmid determined. In animal isolates, it is generally carried on a plasmid. However, it is chromosomally located on most (w70%) isolates from human cases of C perfringens food poisoning. 22 All of the toxins except CPE are secreted by vegetative bacteria. Enterotoxin is released after sporulation and bacterial cell lysis. 7, 8, 22 Alpha Toxin Alpha toxin is produced by all subtypes of C perfringens; however, the amount of toxin secreted varies by both isolate and type. 7 The alpha toxin gene (plc) is located on the bacterial chromosome. Alpha toxin is a phospholipase C sphingomyelinase (lecithinase) enzyme that binds to cell membranes and causes disruption of the lipid bilayer. 7, 8, 23 The toxin is hemolytic and dermonecrotic. Hydrolysis of lecithin by alpha -toxin produces diacylglycerol, which leads to stimulation of eukaryotic cell phospholipases and the arachidonic acid cascade. 8, 23 This process can result in alterations in vascular permeability, platelet aggregation, and vasoconstriction. Alpha toxin has been shown to cause alterations in fluid transport within ileal and colonic loops in sheep. 24 Alpha toxin likely acts in concert with additional virulence factors, resulting in intestinal mucosal damage and, in particular, the C perfringens toxin perfringolysin (theta toxin) seems to work synergistically with alpha toxin in calves. 25, 26 Beta Toxin Beta toxin is produced by type B and C strains of C perfringens. The beta toxin gene (cpb) is encoded on a large plasmid and codes for a small polypeptide protoxin. The protoxin is secreted from the vegetative bacteria and cleaved by proteases to produce the active toxin. 7 Beta toxin is classified as a pore-forming cytolysin, and is similar to other toxins, including Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin. The channels formed by the beta toxin pores are selective for monovalent cations such as sodium and potassium. 27 Beta toxin is rapidly destroyed by trypsin. 3, 7 Because of this, disease caused by types B and C tend to occur in young neonates less than 10 to 21 days of age because of the presence of trypsin inhibitors in colostrum and early milk. Disease may also occur later if bacterial or plant-derived trypsin inhibitors are present in the feed.",

Enterotoxemia is a loosely used term for disease caused by C perfringens and is often used in reference to all clinical forms of C perfringens, including abomasitis and enteritis observed in cattle and other ruminants. This loose terminology can cause confusion when discussing the disease because it does not designate the specific genotype and clinical manifestations of C perfringens syndromes seen in cattle and other ruminants. The term enterotoxemia is best reserved for C perfringens diseases that include absorption and systemic spread of toxins with disorders in other organs beyond the intestinal tract.

C perfringens abomasitis is a sporadic disorder of neonatal to weanling calves, lambs, and kids. 15, 45, 47, 49, 52 The condition is common in both dairy and beef calves and seems to be less common in lambs and kid goats. Clinical signs include decreased nursing, lethargy, fluid distension of the abomasum, abdominal tympany, colic, and bruxism. 49 Animals generally have a normal temperature unless complications of systemic sepsis or peritonitis have developed, in which case their temperature can be decreased or increased. Mucous membranes may be pale with a prolonged capillary refill time indicating systemic shock. Hydration status is often normal in acute cases but dehydration can develop in animals that are not treated soon. Abdominal distension with a succussion splash is a predominant and consistent clinical sign (Fig. 1) . The ability of C perfringens to produce gas contributes to gastric dilatation and intramural emphysema evident in affected animals. Abomasal tympany and the associated abdominal distension also causes respiratory difficulty because of pressure placed on the diaphragm. Abomasal distension can also result in hemodynamic effects that can lead to shock. The case fatality rate of clostridial abomasitis seems to be high when rapid treatment is not instituted (75%-100%). 15, 45, [47] [48] [49] 51 At necropsy, the abomasum is grossly distended and filled with hemorrhagic fluid and gas ( Fig. 2A) . Gross pathology is characterized by diffuse, hemorrhagic to necrotizing inflammation of the abomasal mucosa, frequently involving the deeper layers of the abomasal wall in severe or chronic cases (Fig. 2B ). Abomasal ulceration (Fig. 2C ) and perforation with peritonitis ( Fig. 2D ) may occur in a subset of affected animals. Intramural emphysema and edema of the abomasal wall may be present.",

Glucosuria is frequently present in sheep. 74 At necropsy examination, the effusion is typically observed in the peritoneal, pleural, or pericardial spaces with variable volumes of straw-colored or red fluid that may contain fibrin clots. Petechial hemorrhages are often visible on the visceral surfaces. Pulmonary and mesenteric edema may be evident. Gross lesions of the intestinal tract are frequently absent in affected sheep. Dipstick analysis of urine collected from the bladder frequently reveals the presence of glucose in sheep. The renal cortex may be softened (hence the term pulpy kidney), although this is a nonspecific autolytic change seen on occasion in small ruminant cadavers. The classic pathologic lesion is focal symmetric encephalomalacia. Occasionally, no gross lesions are seen in ovine cases of type D enterotoxemia. 66 Unlike sheep, goats affected by type D enterotoxemia more consistently show signs of GI dysfunction, and gross and histologic lesions are more consistently found in the GI tract. 33, [68] [69] [70] [71] In the peracute form of this disease, affected goats may be found dead or may have colic. Abdominal distension, vocalizing, dyspnea, tachypnea, and watery diarrhea containing fibrin, mucus, or strands of blood may occur. Recumbency, respiratory distress, and convulsions usually follow, and death typically occurs within hours of the onset of signs. Glucosuria is not consistently detected in goats with enterotoxemia. 69 The clinical signs of the acute form of type D enterotoxemia in goats are similar to those of the peracute form, but the progression of the disease occurs over 2 to 4 days. Intermittent or protracted diarrhea, weight loss, and reduced milk production are evident in the chronic form of enterotoxemia in goats. In this form of the disease, clinical signs may persist for several days or occur intermittently over weeks or months. Chronic enterotoxemia may be difficult to diagnose unless prior peracute or acute cases are known to have occurred in the herd. GI parasitism, salmonellosis, Johne disease, and rumen acidosis are important differential diagnoses.",

A percutaneous abomasocentesis can then be performed using a 16-gauge to 20-gauge, 38-mm (1.5-inch) needle inserted directly through the skin into the abomasum. An extension set can be attached to the needle. Allow the gas to freely escape while placing slight pressure on the abdomen. Fluid that drains from the needle can be collected for anaerobic culture, PCR typing, or toxin assays. Before removing the needle, antimicrobials and C perfringens type C and D antitoxin can be administered directly into the abomasum (these syringes should be prepared and ready before starting the abomasocentesis).",

Because the animals typically have ileus and abdominal distension, oral fluids, including milk, are not indicated until the distension is resolved (generally 12-24 hours). IV fluids provide systemic support in treatment of the hypovolemic or maldistributive shock that is often observed in these patients. Some animals with clostridial enteritis do not show significant clinical dehydration, most likely because of the rapid effects of the toxins. Shock fluid rates are 80 mL/kg, and can be divided into one-quarter doses given to effect at intervals of 15 to 30 minutes. Once the shock has been addressed, the fluid rate can be decreased to a maintenance rate of 3 mL/kg/h. Dextrose (5%) can also be provided in the maintenance fluids, because milk is likely to be withheld for 12 to 24 hours. Many animals with clostridial enteritis show mild to moderate hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis caused by the intestinal ileus and delayed abomasal emptying. Thus, isotonic sodium chloride is a suitable initial fluid type to resolve the hypochloremic alkalosis if present. Animals in later stages of the disease may show metabolic acidosis and require the addition of sodium bicarbonate to fluids. IV fluids can be changed to a balanced electrolyte solution after resolution of the shock, or within the first 12 hours.",

During the initial phase, the bacteria may continue to produce and release lethal exotoxins. 86 Further, systemically administered penicillin is excreted via the renal system and is minimally excreted or secreted into the GI tract.

Kaolin in Kaopectate is a potent activator of the extrinsic clotting cascade and may help decrease intestinal blood loss in cases with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. Use of proton pump inhibitors in an attempt to limit mucosal ulceration in clostridial abomasitis cases should likely be discouraged, because there is evidence that these are a risk factor for the development of some types of clostridial GI infections in humans. 90 Pain management should be used on an as-needed basis in these cases. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatories should be used judiciously, because severe shock and decreased renal perfusion may be present. In addition, GI ulceration can occur from the primary disease process, and this could be exacerbated by use or overuse of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as flunixin meglumine or meloxicam. A low dose of flunixin meglumine, as is used to treat the effects of Gram-negative sepsis (0.25 mg/kg IV every 6 hours or 0.3 mg/kg IV every 8 hours) may be preferable to using the labeled cattle dose (up to 2.2 mg/kg IV every 24 hours).

Tetanus is also considered an essential component of a flock immunization program. 93, 94 In a 1962 study in sheep, Sterne and colleagues 95 showed that a multivalent, alum-adjuvanted, formalin-inactivated clostridial bacterin-toxoid administered to sheep in 2 doses induced titers deemed protective against the beta and epsilon toxins of C perfringens. In another study, antibody titers to epsilon toxin of C perfringens type D were induced in sheep immunized with a 2-dose series of a multivalent (8-way) clostridial vaccine. 96 Immunization of ewes 3 weeks before lambing has been shown to induce colostral antibody titers against epsilon toxin that were adequate to impart protection of lambs for up to 12 weeks of age. 97 In that study, adding a 2-dose immunization of the lambs at either days 1 and 21 of age or days 21 and 42 of age did not significantly change the titer of passively protected lambs. Immunization of lambs from vaccinated ewes (that do not have failure or suspected failure of passive transfer) with a C perfringens C and D and tetanus toxoid is recommended at 8 to 12 weeks of age and again 3 to 4 weeks later. 94 Feeder lambs (and ideally replacement ewe lambs) can also receive a booster before entering the feedlot or being placed on a high-grain ration. 94 In goats, most enterotoxemia cases in North America seem to be caused by C perfringens type D. 66 Administration of multivalent ovine enterotoxemia vaccines twice annually to goats has been shown to be ineffective in protecting goats against fatal type D enterotoxemia. 70 Goats do respond, albeit variably, to the epsilon toxin component of C perfringens type D vaccines labeled for sheep. 68 The disparity in protection among the two species may reflect disparate mechanisms of disease. In sheep, most pathologic lesions seem to be the result of translocation of epsilon toxin from the gut to remote organs; for example, the brain. Circulating antitoxin antibodies against epsilon toxin seem to be critical in protecting sheep. In goats, however, the more localized disease process (enterocolitis) does not seem to be effectively or consistently curtailed by anti-epsilon toxin antibodies in the bloodstream. 33, 68, 69 However, in a 1998 study, immunization with an epsilon toxoid combined with Freund incomplete adjuvant did protect goats against intraduodenal challenge with purified epsilon toxin, whereas a commercial, aluminum hydroxideadjuvanted product did not. 33 Existing C perfringens C and D toxoids may need to be administered to goats more than twice per year to confer adequate (albeit partial) protection. 70 Administration of C perfringens type C and D to cattle has been shown to induce protective titers against both the beta toxin 98 and epsilon toxin 99 in recipients. Neonates and young, growing animals in stocker operations and feedlots are considered to be at higher risk for clostridial diseases relative to adults, but the risk seems to vary among herds. 72, 92 For the former group, immunization of pregnant cows and heifers has been shown to produce antitoxin titers considered adequate for protection against type C and D infections in colostrum-fed calves. 99 Many ranchers immunize calves with multivalent clostridial vaccines before weaning, but, in many cases, repeat immunization of calves to provoke an anamnestic titer is not consistently performed during the preweaning period. Troxel and colleagues 99 determined that vaccination of colostrum-fed calves (from immunized dams) with a multivalent clostridial vaccine at 50 to 53 days of age and again at weaning at w170 days produced titers to beta and epsilon toxin that were not considered protective for calves during the preweaning period. The investigators concluded that this 4-month gap between the first and second immunizations may not be optimal for herds in which clostridial diseases occur in preweaned calves, and alterations in management and/or vaccination schedule would be warranted in such cases. In another study, immunization of colostrum-fed calves (from immunized dams) at 3 weeks of age with a single-dose clostridial bacterintoxoid did not significantly affect type C or D antitoxin titers over the first 4 months of life; however, significant differences in antitoxin titers among different vaccines were apparent. 100 In a 2000 survey of feedlot operators, more than 90% of operators overseeing lots with a capacity more than 8000 head used at least 1 type of clostridial vaccine in their cattle. 101 In a prospective feedlot study involving nearly 19,000 animals, death losses were compared among calves immunized against clostridial diseases and those that were not. 102 Treated calves were administered a 7-way clostridial vaccine at arrival and 30 days later. Reduction in death loss in the vaccinated calves, weighed against purchase price and vaccine cost, provided an additional net profit of more than $10 per vaccinate. 102 More recently, DeGroot and colleagues 103 found no detectable effect of booster vaccination with a multivalent clostridial vaccine on sudden death syndrome mortality in feedlot cattle.",

As a result, some animals may receive multiple (predicted as many as 6) clostridial vaccinations before marketing, potentially compounding problems with injection site reactions in carcasses. 104 When administered subcutaneously twice to feedlot calves, a 7-way clostridial vaccine induced significant reduction in feed intake after the second immunization and larger injection site lesions than did a C perfringens type C and D toxoid. 104 C perfringens type C and D toxoid vaccines are not designed to specifically stimulate an immune response against alpha toxin.

One commercial type A toxoid vaccine is available (Clostridium Perfringens Type A Toxoid, Elanco) and has been shown to be safe and stimulate an antibody response against alpha toxin.

Diarrheic calves were twice as likely to be culture positive compared with those without diarrhea. 114 Nondiarrheic calves, however, more commonly had toxin-positive stools. 114 This team of researchers concluded that these findings lent credence to the idea that CDI may manifest as diarrhea in young cattle. 114 C difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) was also suspected in a neonatal elk calf, based on finding a toxigenic C difficile fecal isolate in the absence of other more common enteropathogens. 115 Similarly, the authors have tentatively diagnosed 3 alpaca crias with CDAD based on fecal ELISAs positive for C difficile toxins A and/or B, in combination with exclusion of other common infectious causes of camelid diarrhea and a history of prior antimicrobial administration (authors' personal experience). It is possible that CDAD in livestock occurs more frequently than reported, but it remains underdiagnosed because attempted identification of C difficile and its toxins is not routinely performed in most diarrheic ruminants. Provides immunity against the beta and epsilon toxins in calves via colostral transfer Enteric immunity from anti-beta toxin colostral antibody during the first 2 wk of life is critical in preventing disease from types B and C, because trypsin inhibitors in colostrum prevent denaturation of beta toxin Systemic immunity from anti-epsilon toxin antibodies are effective at neutralizing systemically absorbed epsilon toxin and preventing neurologic signs from type D AE type B infections C perfringens type A Initial immunization followed by booster in 2-4 wk, then: Yearly 2-4 wk before calving C perfringens C and D toxoid vaccines are not designed to specifically stimulate an immune response against alpha toxin and usually are not considered effective at preventing abomasitis or enteritis caused by type A May be particularly important in farms with a history of type A outbreaks in calves Might also be useful in adult cows on dairies with a history of HBS ",
