            "text": "Modern transfusion medicine in Europe has successfully handled the major threats to a safe blood supply by \"classical viral\" transfusion-transmitted pathogens like HCV and HIV. However, this was only managed by utilizing major financial and expert resources. Today, European harmonisation of optimal use of blood components in clinical hemotherapy, uniform quality standards for blood donations, testing and component production as well as an increasing cost pressure in clinical care are tasks, which need our full attention. Modern cellular therapies and regenerative medicine are novel treatment options, which can only be handled by a close cooperation between clinicians and transfusion medicine specialists. Future challenges comprise proactive measures like pathogen inactivation for all blood components in order to diminish threats to blood safety by (re-)emerging pathogens, an adequate blood supply bearing in mind the ongoing ageing of most European populations and political decisions regarding a potential open \"blood market\" in Europe, which in our opinion should not be supported by the European Union. History: When after World War II the needs of modern medicine called for well organized blood donor services, most European governments handed this task over to their respective national Red Cross organizations. With increasing demand for blood components, encouragement and mobilization of the healthy population to donate blood became one of the prominent tasks of these new organizations in the 50s of the last century. The aging of most European populations nowadays demands great efforts to provide blood donations from healthy volunteers since most surgical procedures on elderly patients require more blood products than the same procedure on young people does.",

For hemophilia patients, who in former times died in early adulthood due to bleedings or other complications, the introduction of self-treatment at home with factor VIII or factor XI concentrates helped these patients to achieve a normal life expectancy. However, most of the hemophiliacs treated suffered from hepatitis B or hepatitis C in the last decades of the last century. In the 80s of the last century, the first AIDS scandal helped to accelerate the development of heat-inactivated factor VIII concentrates. Later on, in the 90s of the last century, a second AIDS scandal in blood products shocked Germany: Following this, public authorities were closed and the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute took over responsibility for granting marketing authorizations for blood and plasma products. New institutions like the \"Arbeitskreis Blut\" at the German Ministry of Health with experts from transfusion medicine, hemostaseology and patient care were established and new laws like the transfusion law were inaugurated as well.",

These pose an acute and more dangerous threat to safe blood transfusions than the \"classical\" viral pathogens such as hepatitis viruses and HIV, which today are almost negligible transfusion risks as has already been described above. The new threats from (re-)emerging pathogens require constant hemovigilance and acute decisions regarding new test procedures for these pathogens or the introduction of pathogen inactivation measures for blood products as they become available in Europe.",

Close cooperation and scientific networking with industrial and clinical partners in tissue transplantation, cell therapy and other new fields of medicine are vital to the future of our field. However, funding for R&D, competition with the pharmaceutical industry regarding blood donor screening and new blood substitutes, as well as growth factors like erythropoietin or thrombopoietin provide some examples of the more problematic fields in this competition. Many experts are calling for a trend to \"bloodless medicine\". However, evidence of any true benefit from \"bloodless medicine\" is lacking. Growth factors like erythropoietin show adverse events like a potential increase in tumor growth and their use has not led to the mortality reduction hoped for in several patient populations. Optimal use of blood products is a worthwhile goal to aim for; however, the risk of undertransfusion in some patients has to be taken into account. In some European countries, strategies to reduce allogenic blood transfusion led to less advertising for healthy volunteer blood donors which finally resulted in the dramatic reduction in blood donations now endangering the blood supply in these countries. Future challenges in transfusion medicine: Medical: Maintaining and increasing blood transfusion safety: With the successful containment of the transmission of the \"classical\" viruses like hepatitis and HIV by transfusion, the focus has shifted to sources of lower risks to blood transfusion safety: Screening of blood donations for prions, bacterial screening (especially in platelet concentrates), pathogen inactivation of all blood products and testing for new and emerging pathogens [5] are examples of ongoing challenges in transfusion medicine. Transplantation medicine: Transplantation of solid organs and hematopoietic stem cells require complex diagnostic and procedural logistics: HLAtesting, stem cells apheresis and storage as well as new cell therapies like stem cells in acute myocardial infarction and chronic heart diseases are examples of the vast developments in this field [6, 7] . New blood products and regenerative medicine: Hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow are nowadays almost completely replaced by peripheral hematopoietic stem cells obtained via apheresis procedures. Umbilical cord stem cells are a promising source of hematopoietic stem cells also in adult patients nowadays. Cellular therapeutics and gene therapy as well as immunotherapy are novel",

Medical histories taken by a doctor from every blood donor, a medical examination and the exclusion of donors with an increased risk of transmitting blood borne diseases are well established measures to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission by blood transfusion. Laboratory blood donor screening nowadays includes serological markers like HBsAg, Anti-HBc, Anti-HCV, Anti-HIV I/II, Anti-CMV and TPHA-testing as well as pool-PCR-testing for HCV, HIV and HBV (HBV-PCR-testing is not mandatory in Germany). The combination of all these measures led to a dramatic reduction in the risk of transfusion transmitted HCV or HIV infections in Germany: The observed frequency of transfusion associated viral infections for 1997 to 2006 for ELISA-and pool-PCRnegative blood products from unpaid donors of the German Red Cross was as follows [",
