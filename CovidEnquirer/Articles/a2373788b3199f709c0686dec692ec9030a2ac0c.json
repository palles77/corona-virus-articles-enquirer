The attack rates during such periods have been reported to be as high as 10-40%. 1 Other viruses implicated are respiratory syncycial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus and in a lower frequency, coronavirus and enterovirus. 2 New viruses such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), bocavirus, the new coronaviruses (NL 63) and polyomavirus (KI, WU) have been recently identified. Limited information is available about their significance and frequency in non-hospitalized adult patients although they can also cause severe respiratory illness. [3] [4] [5] All age groups are affected by Flu infection but serious complications occur more frequently in young children, immunocompromised patients and the elderly. 6 These infections can lead to inadequate antibiotic use, numerous outpatient visits, and increased mortality in elderly nursing home patients. 7 Several studies have reported that other viruses such as RSV 8 and even bacteria can cause similar signs and symptoms. Therefore, rapid viral diagnosis is important to install antiviral treatment and to detect Flu outbreaks.",

This reinforces the need for a rapid viral diagnosis in order to define etiology, prevent indiscriminate use of antibiotics, reduce unnecessary interventions and implement infection-control measures including isolation of infected individuals. Lina and Valette. also observed that viral etiology in patients with ILI disease cannot be predicted on the basis of their clinical picture only. 15 Flu virus only responds to the use of antivirals if the treatment is started within the first 2 days of the onset of fever. In our study, most of the patients consulted after 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. In addition, viral diagnosis by IFI was not available in the same day. Therefore, our results were not useful in a timely manner for antiviral treatment. Rapid antigen devices for Flu which can give a result within the hour are useful in these cases. On the other side, viral etiology permitted infection control measures, like patient isolation. This is particularly important in the high-risk population such as immunocompromised patients and their close contacts. In addition, viral etiology contributed to epidemiological data and permitted identification of circulating strains.",

For year 2004, 11 samples were Flu A positive and 3 were Flu B positive by IIF. Cell culture allowed to detect three more Flu A cases; three more Flu B cases and one adenovirus case (Table 1). The sensitivity of IIF compared to cell culture for Flu was 70%. During both years, circulation of Flu A was detected up to week 30, while few cases of Flu B were observed during the whole studied period. RSV was only detected in 2005. All Flu A strains were subtyped as H3. For 2004, four Flu A isolates were similar to the 2004 vaccine strain A \u2044 Fujian \u2044 411 \u2044 02 (H3N2) and four were antigenically different from vaccine virus, but closely related to A \u2044 Wellington \u2044 1 \u2044 2004 (H3N2). The rest could not be characterized. For 2005, characterization was achieved in 13 samples only, 11 Flu A and 2 Flu B. All Flu A strains were characterized as A \u2044 California \u2044 7 \u2044 04 (H3N2) and were closely related to 2005 vaccine strain A \u2044 Wellington \u2044 1 \u2044 2004 (H3N2). For Flu B, one strain was similar to B \u2044 Hong Kong \u2044 330 \u2044 01 (Victoria lineage) vaccine strain for 2004, and the other corresponded to B \u2044 Shangai \u2044 361 \u2044 02 (Yamagata lineage), vaccine strain for the Southern hemisphere for 2005.",
