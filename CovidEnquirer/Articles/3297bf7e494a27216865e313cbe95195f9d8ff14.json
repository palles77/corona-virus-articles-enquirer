            "text": "The recombinant nucleocapsid (rN) protein of the coronavirus (CoV) responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, extracted from cell lysates containing 6 M urea, then purified by Ni 2+ -affinity chromatography. In animal immunogenicity studies, we found that most anti-rN protein antibodies were IgG2a in BALB/c mice vaccinated with rN emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 containing the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide, CpG. In contrast, anti-rN protein antibodies of mice immunized with rN protein in PBS were found to mainly be IgG1. These results indicated that ISA-51/CpG-formulated rN protein was dramatically biased toward a Th1 immune response. To identify the B-cell immunodominant epitopes of the rN protein in the mouse and monkey, the reactivities of antisera raised against purified rN proteins formulated in ISA-51/CpG were tested with a panel of overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire N protein sequence. Three immunodominant linear B-cell epitope regions were mapped to residues 166-180, 356-375, and 396-410 of the rN protein. When the reactivities of these peptides were screened with human sera from five SARS patients, peptides corresponding to residues 156-175 reacted strongly with sera from two of the SARS patients. These results indicated that the region around residues 156-175 of the N protein is immunogenic in the mouse, monkey, and human. We found that peptides corresponding to residues 1-30, 86-100, 306-320, and 351-365 contained murine immunodominant T-cell epitopes. To identify functional CTL epitopes of the N protein, BALB/c mice were immunized with peptides containing the H-2K d CTL motif emulsified in adjuvant ISA-51/CpG. Using an IFN-\u2425 secretion cell assay and analysis by flow cytometry, peptides containing residues 81-95 were found to be capable of stimulating both CD4 + and CD8 + cell proliferation in vitro. We also only observed that peptides corresponding to residues 336-350 were capable of stimulating IFN-\u2425 production in T-cell cultures derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of macaques immunized with the rN protein emulsified in ISA/CpG adjuvant. Our current results together with those of others suggest that some immunodominant B-cell and T-cell epitopes are conserved in the mouse, monkey, and human. This information is very important for the development SARS diagnostic kits and a vaccine.",

The lack of efficient treatments and prevention means the possibility exists for SARS to return in the future. In addition, high-risk populations such as laboratory and hospital workers need effective 0264 SARS vaccines for protection. Unfortunately, recent reports have shown that inactivated coronavirus vaccines in a cat model might worsen the disease rather than prevent it [1] . Furthermore, the SARS virus may cause mild liver inflammation in ferrets, and the damage was much more serious if animals were first given a candidate SARS vaccine based on the vaccinia virus [2] . Yang et al. [3] also found that antibodies against SARS CoV S protein enhanced the entry of virus in in vitro cell culture studies. Therefore, in order to generate safe and effective SARS vaccines, we urgently need greater understanding of the immunological responses of vaccine candidates in different animal models.",

The literature indicates that immunization of DNA plasmids that encode the N protein of the Ebola virus and influenza virus elicits protective antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses [5] [6] [7] . In avian coronaviruses, N protein-specific T-cell responses were shown to generate protective immunity [8] . These results indicate that a good N protein vaccine candidate should elicit strong cellular immune responses. The N protein of SARS CoV is 422 amino acids long and highly conserved (99%) within different isolates, but it shares only 20-30% amino acid homology with the N proteins of other coronaviruses [9] . In fact, the DNA vaccine candidate encoding the N protein of the SARS CoV fused with calreticulin (CRT) was shown to induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses in a mouse model, and inhibited replication of the recombinant vaccinia virus that expressed the N protein in vivo [10] . We therefore focused on the N protein of the SARS CoV as the target antigen for subunit vaccine development.",

After disruption using a French Press (Constant Systems, Daventry, UK) at 186 Mpa, cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (80,000 \u00d7 g for 60 min). Most of the target protein was extracted from the pellet with 8 M urea in homogenate buffer and loaded into 1 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, San Diego, CA, USA). The resin was washed with the same buffer, and the target protein was purified by changing the pH value.

Like other viruses with spike proteins on the viral surface, coronaviruses have been shown to elicit enhancement of disease through non-neutralizing spike protein-specific antibodies [3] , so vaccines that elicit T-cell immunity against SARS proteins are likely to receive more-favorable clinical attention. In animal coronavirus vaccine development, the N protein has been widely tested as an immunogen for protection against coronavirus infections. Inoculation of chickens with plasmid DNA encoding the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) carboxyl terminus of the N protein led to the induction of a specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte population capable of recognizing two distinct IBV strains. In addition, the adoptive transfer of T cells from animals inoculated with IBV to na\u00efve chicks provided CD8 + \u2423\u2424 specific protection [13] . A Th1 T-cell line resistant to the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) showed marked increases in IFN-\u2425 expression with a decrease in IL-4 production when incubated with MHV-infected cells [14] . Infusion of this resistant cell line into susceptible mice led to complete protection against MHV infection. The immunity against MHV was demonstrated to be a process dependent upon CD8 + , perforin, and IFN-\u2425 in the absence of CD4 + T cells [15] . The generation of IgG2a antibodies following DNA immunization of N protein suggested that there was a significant Th1-type response [16] . With the strong potential protective immunity of N protein-based vaccines, we hypothesized that the SARS CoV N protein would elicit effective immune responses against SARS diseases.",

Different adjuvant formulations induced different immune responses in immunized animals. To assess the immune responses elicited by the rN protein in our BALB/c mouse model, rN protein was formulated with either incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), a potent adjuvant complex, ISA/CpG, or PBS alone. After three immunizations (50 g of rN protein per dose), the N proteinspecific antibody responses were measured using ELISA, and results are shown in Fig. 2A . The antibody titers were found to be 8 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , 5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , and 5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 in the ISA/CpG, IFA, and PBS groups, respectively. To test whether the strong immune response elicited by the rN protein formulated with ISA/CpG was useful in clinical application, we analyzed the subtypes of reactive antibodies from all groups. The isotypes generated in different groups are shown in Fig. 2B ; most of the antibodies were IgG1 found in the PBS group (1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ), with less IgG2a (1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). There were similar IgG1 titers found in both the IFA and ISA/CpG groups (3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ).

This result indicated that ISA/CpG could drive the immune response toward Th1, and is consistent with previous results which showed that the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide CpG motif could skew the host's immune response toward Th1 [17] and the combination of CpG and ISA-51 also showed the ability to enhance the protective efficacy of a subunit malaria vaccine candidate [11] .",

To systemically analyze the B-cell epitopes, each of the peptide pools (NP1-NP8), consisting of 10 consecutive 15-mer overlapping peptides of the N protein, was used to screen against anti-N antisera (see Table 1 ). In this peptide-ELISA assay, we used the rN protein as the positive control and internal standard to normalize the reactivity. Since we desired to determine the immunodominant epitopes, mouse sera were diluted to 1:5000 for epitope screening.

Also peptides no. 72, 73, and 80 in NP8 were found to contain macaque immunodominant B-cell epitopes. Peptides no. 32-34 and 36 in peptide pool NP4 were shown to be most reactive with serum from monkey no. 1 (Fig. 3B ). From the results described above, the conserved immunodominant B-cell epitopes in mice and monkeys were located within peptides no. 34 (residues 166-180), 72 (residues 351-365), 73 (residues 356-370), and 80 (residues 396-410).",

As shown in Fig. 5A , IFN-\u2425 production was observed in both IFA-and ISA/CpG-immunized groups, and several different peptides were found to be capable of stimulating IFN-\u2425 secretion.
