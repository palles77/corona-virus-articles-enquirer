            "text": "The isotype antibody responses to bovine IND p, G6 and simian SAll P', G3 rotavirus and SAll rotavirus proteins (VP4, VP6 and VP7) in serum, colostrum and milk were analysed by ELBA in three groups of vaccinated cows and nonvaccinated controls. Pregnant cows were vaccinated intramuscularly and intramammarily with recombinant baculovirus-expressed SAll rotavirus VLP (triple-layered virus-like particles containing rotavirus VP2, VP4, VP4 and VP7); CLP (double-layered core-like particles containing rotavirus VP2 and VP6); or inactivated SAll rotavirus, respectively. Rotavirus antigen titers were highest (30-200-fold) in ELISA in the VLP vaccine compared to the inactivated SAll vaccine. The IgGl, IgG2 and IgM geometric mean antibody titers (GMT) to rotavirus (titers to bovine rotavirus vs SAll rotavirus did not d@er signtjicantly for any isotype or group) and the IgG2 GMT to VP6 in serum at calving in the vaccinated groups were significantly (P cO.05) higher than in the control group. In colostrum, IgGl and IgA rotavirus antibody titers were significantly elevated for VLP (IgGl GMT 832225; IgA GMT 16384), CLP (IgGl GMT 660561; IgA GMT 10321) and S ill (IgGl GMT 131072; IgA GMT 1448) vaccinated cows compared to control cows ( igG1 GMT 1158.5; IgA GMT 45). The IgGl and IgA GMT to rotavirus were sign$cantly elevated (6-loo-fold) in milk of VLP and CLP vaccinated cows compared to SAll vaccinated or control cows. The isotype antibody responses to VP6 in serum, colostrum and milk paralleled the responses to rotavirus, but titers were -2--IO-fold lower. Only cows vaccinated with VLP had significantly enhanced serum, colostral and milk antibody titers to rotavirus VP4 and VP7. These results demonstrate that rotavirus antibody titers in serum, colostrum and milk are significantly enhanced by use of non-infectious VLP, CLP and inactivated SAll rotavirus vaccines, but the VLP or CLP vaccines induced the highest antibody responses, corresponding to their higher rotavirus antigen titers measured by ELISA.

However BRV vaccine efficacy was variable in field ~r~a~s3~4~6~13~14~16~18~ Recently, using the baculovirus expression system, recombinant viral multiprotein structures have been produced, referred to as virus-like particles (VLP) or core-like particles (CLP). Such r: articles, reported initially by P. Roy and coworkers' for bluetongue'virus, and by Labbe and coworkers\" for rotavirus, represent a new generation of non-infectious, stable, antigenically authentic and highly immunogenic vaccines . Crawford et al.\" described the production of triple-layered rotavirus-like particles (VLP) by the coexpression of BRV and SAll inner (VP2 and VP6, respectively) and simian SAll rotavirus outer (VP4 and VP7) capsid protein genes in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system (SAl 1 VLP). Previous studies of such VLP, including the ones produced from bluetongue virus, indicate that these VLP are antigenically authentic and immune responses induced by the VLP mimic those induced by intact virions'9p'2. Therefore our objectives were to compare the use of an inactivated SAll rotavirus vaccine (mimic existing inactivated BRV commercial vaccine) with SAll CLP (comprised of rotavirus VP2 and 6) and VLP (comprised rotavirus of VP2, 4, 6 and 7) subunit vaccines to immunize pregnant cows to boost antibodies to BRV in colostrum and milk for induction of passive immunity in newborn calves. For these studies we used the vaccination routes and times (intramuscular at -9 weeks pre-portum and intramammarily at -7 weeks pre-portum) and adjuvant (incomplete Freund'sb,t!at evoked maximal antibody responses previously ' . Using ELISA, we investigated the isotype-specific antibody titers to rotavirus and rotavirus proteins (VP4, 6 and 7) in the serum, colostrum and milk of non-vaccinated cows, and cows vaccinated with inactivated SAll or SAll CLP and VLP subunit vaccines.",

These results confirm that the antibody response to VLP, CLP and inactivated rotavirus was mainly associated with the major structural protein (VP6) which accounts for about 50% of the total virion mass, with lower antibody GMT detected to VP4 and VP7 (for VLP and SAl 1 vaccinated cows only) which account for only 1.5% and 30%, respectively of the virion mass. Also, only in cows that received the VLP vaccine (containing VP4+ VP7) were significantly increased antibody responses detected in colostrum and milk to these two outer capsid proteins. A probable explanation for the differences observed in response to the VLP, CLP and inactivated SAll rotavirus vaccines may be the differences in antigen concentrations in each vaccine preparation as measured by ELISA using a panel of MAb and polyclonal antibodies ( Table 2 ). The VP4, VP6 and VP7 antigen concentrations were higher for the VLP vaccine (at least 30-200-fold, respectively than the SAll vaccine). Although, no differences were detected in VP6 antigen concentration between CLP and VLP vaccines, as expected the VP4 and VP7 proteins were undetected in the CLP vaccine which was comprised of only VP2 and VP6. The BEI-inactivated SAl 1 vaccine did not show a loss of reactivity in ELISA after inactivation compared with the live virus, confirming a previous report3'. Therefore, the inactivation procedure per se did not account for the lower antigenicity of this vaccine in ELISA or the lower antibody responses elicited in viva.

However cross-reactive, non-serotype specific epitopes are also present on the outer capsid proteins, VP4 and VP7 and it is established that heterologous strains of rotavirus can enhance heterologous and homologous antibody responses in seropositive animals4.34q'5. It is possible that the ELISA antibody responses to SAll VP4 which often were similar in magnitude to the responses to SAll VP7 in the VLP-inoculated cows may reflect a greater tendency of VP4 to induce broadly cross-reactive antibodies as one might expect during booster responses in rotavirus seropositive cows. However a direct comparison of the antibody titers to VP4 versus VP7 is difficult since different ELISA test systems (direct coating versus antibody-capture) had to be used to develop reliable assays.
