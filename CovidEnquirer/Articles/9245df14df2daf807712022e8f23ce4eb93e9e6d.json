After the SARS outbreak in 2003, a SARS Expert Committee was commissioned by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to conduct a review of the capacity of the Hong Kong healthcare system to better prepare for any future outbreak. During the outbreak of SARS in 2003, the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance 2 (QPDO) of the laws of Hong Kong was the legal tool that provided the legal framework for the prevention and control of infectious diseases of public health importance in Hong Kong. As part of the review, the legislative framework for the prevention and control of infectious diseases was examined. The Committee concluded that the legislation had not kept pace with modern developments, such as the increase in international travel, and recommended that the adequacy of the legislation should be reviewed. 3 On the advice of the SARS Expert Committee, a comprehensive review of Hong Kong's infectious disease legislation was conducted with a view to updating the legal framework for the prevention of infectious diseases. This article shares Hong Kong's experience in reforming its public health legislation, leading to the passing of the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance 4 in order to strengthen the capacity of law to support strategy in the control of infectious diseases.",

Medical surveillance took place on the conditional release of a person from isolation, subject to the signing of a bond by that person to submit to surveillance. However, the QPDO did not provide separate specific powers of isolation or quarantine of persons. Rather, it provided for the removal and detention of cases, contacts or carriers of infectious diseases to a place appointed by public health doctors, without reference to separation of the ill or the exposed from the healthy, which is the key element of both isolation and quarantine.",

A considerable portion of the legislation was devoted to disease-specific powers for each of the quarantinable diseases. Medical examinations and surveillance of travellers were only provided for cholera and plague for passengers of incoming vessels and aircraft.

These features of the QPDO hampered the response to the prevention and control of SARS, and led to the necessity for urgent amendments to the subsidiary legislation in the midst of the SARS outbreak. Amendments were needed to authorize medical examination of travellers for the purpose of prevention of cross-border spread of the disease; as a result, health declarations at the land border needed to be conducted administratively.",

As part of the administration's response to the recommendations of the SARS Expert Committee, the issue of review of the QDPO was discussed in the Legislative Council in 2004. Legislative Council members expressed serious concern that the QPDO was antiquated and therefore inadequate to deal with new and serious infections such as SARS. Members also supported the proposal that international best practice, as stipulated in the IHR, should be followed, and urged the administration to reform the QPDO expeditiously. 8, 9 Nevertheless, it was also the responsibility of the Legislative Council to scrutinize law to ensure that coercive power vested in the Government was not unfettered. In the process of amendment of the QDPO during the outbreak of SARS in 2003, Legislative Council members were critical of two key issues of the bill. Firstly, the proposed powers, which were potentially applicable to all infectious diseases, were too generic. It was decided that the new provisions should only be applicable to SARS. Secondly, it was determined that there should be a limit (sunset clause) on the effective period of the provisions. 10 This limit recognized the important legal principle that any coercive power should be the least restrictive necessary in terms of scope and duration.",

The scope of the emergency regulations would include a legal power for the purpose of combating and controlling the particular public health emergency situation. In particular, it may empower the Government to access and to disclose information to the public relating to the state of the public health emergency for the purpose of protecting public health, provide for the requisition of private property (e.g. vaccines, medicine, personal protective gear, vehicles, vessels, etc.) and healthcare workers, provide for closure of places for public gathering, and provide other necessary powers with regard to the nature and circumstance of the public health emergency.",
