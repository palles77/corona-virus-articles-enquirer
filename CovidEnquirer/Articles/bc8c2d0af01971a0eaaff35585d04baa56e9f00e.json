An extended BU area was developed, including the BU and ICU areas, with the PSW becoming the designated overflow burns ward for Bali patients.In total, 35 of the Bali bombing burn victims were referred to RPH.

Details of MROs grown from the Bali patients are shown inTable 1.The lMS response to Bali patients with MROsThe numerous MROs identified required a broad and reactive infection control plan. Management of patients carrying MROs varied depending on patient location and availability of single rooms. ICU patients carrying VRE on admission screening were accommodated in single rooms from admission. However, some ICU patients carrying MRAB isolates could not initially be isolated because of a shortage of single rooms.After identification of MRAB and VRE carriers in ICU, environmental surveillance swabbing was instigated. No environmental VRE contamination was found. However, MRAB was isolated in the vicinity of six MRAB-positive ICU patients. Once the open area in ICU was cleared of patients, thorough environmental cleaning and disinfection were performed. Environmental cleaning and disinfection of the ICU were continued until two sets of environmental swabs were negative.Patients carrying MROs were isolated with additional precautions from admission in the BU. MRAB environmental contamination was identified in the BU from surfaces in the female staff change room and general office areas. Environmental cleaning and disinfection of the BU was continued until two sets of environmental swabs were all negative.Separation of Bali patients with MROs in the PSW was not possible, as there were no single rooms.
