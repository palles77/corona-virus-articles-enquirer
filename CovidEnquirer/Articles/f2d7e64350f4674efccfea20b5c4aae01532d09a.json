At present the country has different health insurance systems, namely, the Universal Coverage scheme, the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme, and the Social Security Scheme. Administrative databases on inpatient care have been used for the development of a Thai case-mix system called the Thai Diagnosis Related Group [3] . It is currently being implemented in the country as a payment scheme for inpatient care for the beneficiaries of the health insurance systems. The health-care providers rendering health-care services to the beneficiaries of the insurer are not limited only to the MoPH providers but also include other public and private providers. Thus, the inpatient database is huge in terms of coverage. There is an issue, however, on data collection because the country has fragmented health insurance schemes, which has resulted in the separation of data collection. The same is the case with the collection of administrative data on outpatient care. For the Universal Coverage scheme and the Social Security Scheme members, data are also collected from contracted hospitals for additional performance payment by the National Health Security Office and the Social Security Office, respectively. The data component of the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme outpatient database, which is fully used for fee-for-service reimbursement, is still limited. Prescription database has been developed in most big hospitals for dispensing purpose, but it has not been used for reimbursement. However, the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme plans to develop this database for reimbursement and to control the pharmaceutical expenditure of the scheme due to rapid outpatient cost escalation (Table 2) .",

In addition, based on the government's 11th Five-Year Plan, which forms the basis for social and economic policies, the requirements for health are the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the health reform plan.

The Country Health Systems Surveillance platform is a multipartner effort that began in 2008, led by the World Health Organization for improving the availability, quality, and utilization of the data needed to inform the country's health-sector reviews and planning processes and to monitor health-system performance [4] . The three dimensions of the Country Health Systems Surveillance platform are strengthening the demand and use of information, improving the supply of quality data and statistics for decision making, and enhancing the institutional capacity for assessment and monitoring of performance [5] . In response to these endeavors, a national comprehensive health information system was established and adopts indicators for monitoring health-care reform progress based on the proposed reform interventions by development partners. The country's health information system is composed of several subsystems: 1) the Routine Health Statistic Information System, which is annually collecting information and data on health facilities, human resources, and equipment and services provided to outpatients and inpatients; 2) the Disease Surveillance System, which is a Web-based system reporting on more than 30 infectious diseases; 3) the National Household Health Services Survey, which collects information on health status, access to care, satisfaction, demands and utilization, expenditure, and risk behavior such as smoking and alcohol use every 5 years; 4) the Maternal and Child Health Care Surveillance System, which annually collects information on maternal and child health care; and 5) the Health Supervision Information System, which annually collects information on food, public facilities, and schools as well as on environmental change [6] . The Center for Health Statistics and Information was set up under the supervision of the Ministry of Health (MoH) to take the administrative responsibility of collecting data from health facilities and summarizing data from other departments. It includes a branch of statistics, monitoring data collection, and a branch of surveys and evaluation, which ensures information quality and publishes reports.",

The remaining 3% of the total population, usually those who have no capability to pay for the contribution, is covered by the Medical Assistance Program. The method of reimbursement is mainly through fee-for-service scheme while seven disease areas are paid under the diagnosis related group scheme. The NHIC database represents the total Korean population. HIRA's data include patient's demographic information, medical utilization/transaction information, and insurer's payment coverage as well as patient's out-of-pocket payments. The data also include diagnostic code, procedures code, and pharmacy claim records.

Jeong and colleagues [7] reported in 2008 that about 28% of total healthcare expenditure occurred in the nonreimbursed sector, which means that our data set could underestimate the overall utilization pattern. Another issue is the internal validity of diagnosis codes found in the claims database-it does not contain the records of medical conditions because these data sets were created for claims purposes only. According to Park et al. [8] , about 70% of primary diagnosis codes concurred with medical records. Furthermore, the consistency of clinical definition has been an issue as well because of subjective diagnosis criteria. Therefore, case definition, followed by validation, should be considered before using the NHI database.",

There are many other health-care databases in Japan; however, this article focuses only on the health insurance claims database because claims data are one of the most important sources for pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research. Apart from Taiwan and South Korea, Japan is one of the countries in the region with universal coverage of health insurance. The total number of claims is about 1.6 billion per year in Japan. Each participating medical institution and pharmacy issues claims reimbursement every month for each patient. On the side of the insurer, such as municipalities and health insurance societies, these claims are used to make payments to medical institutions and pharmacies. Because of several numbers of insurers, claims coming from different institutions and multiple periods of care are merged for one patient to analyze the whole resource use and cost of one episode of disease management. Japan utilizes a case-mix system called the Diagnosis-Procedure Combination (DPC) to pay the health-care providers. This patient classification system was launched in 2002 by the MHLW, and it was linked with a lump-sum payment system from 2003. The number of participating hospitals is 1391, which includes 82 university hospitals because they are obliged to adopt the DPC system. The number of inpatients represented approximately 50% of all inpatient admissions to acute care hospitals in Japan. A survey of DPC hospitals is conducted between July and December every year by the MHLW.",

Japan uses International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), codes and text data in the Japanese language, and procedures are coded with the Japanese original codes in their records. The physicians in charge are mandated to submit data on diagnoses with reference to medical charts. Hospital staff should record the dates when all procedures and examinations are performed and when drugs and devices are used.

Information on Mandatory Notifications Disease Surveillance is kept in each district health office and sent to the state health office as well as the Disease Control Division of the MoH in the headquarters. Although it is an offence if the practitioners do not notify these diseases, the laws related to this practice are rarely enforced. Reasons for non-notifications by practitioners include unconfirmed diagnosis, cases being referred to hospitals or other facilities, unclear notification procedures, and patients' refusal to be notified for fear of social stigma [19] . Clinic-based surveillance includes sentinel surveillance and national syndromic surveillance, which are being carried out in the specific clinics, wards, and even facilities. Community-based surveillance is done in response to major outbreak of infectious diseases. Community members may report to health personnel on suspicious cases of certain diseases.

Most of the data come from the services provided by the hospitals and clinics in the public sector. Less than 40% of private hospitals participate in sending data to the MoH. The accuracy of the data is also one of the concerns in the country. Coding of diagnosis is done by health-care workers with little or without formal training in ICD coding. In the country, only about 60% of deaths are medically certified because of lack of professional certification on causes of deaths. Thus, uncertified deaths are not accurately documented in the death certificates, which go into the database submitted to the MoH. Documentation of diagnosis both in hospitals and in health centers is limited to single primary diagnosis. Information on surgical and medical procedures is never collected. The lack of documentation or in-complete collection of data deprives the researchers and decision makers of the information regarding the complexity and severity of cases managed. Furthermore, this may limit the use of information for planning, budgeting, and quality-monitoring purposes. Most of the data submitted to the central headquarters are in aggregated form. Patient-level data are not routinely collected both at the state level and at the central level. Thus, this limits the data for research and policy development.",

Administrative data mainly cover health services provided by clinics owned and managed by the public sector. Another concern is the accuracy in the coding of diseases and procedures, which is often done by health staff with little or no training in coding. Difficulty in collecting and merging is also an issue due to the fragmented health-care system in terms of financing and heath-care provisions.
