Nervous tissues are derived from the ectoderm and eventually form all central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) tissues of the adult animal. In the developing embryo, neurogenesis begins with a locally extensive, elongate proliferation of cells known as the neural plate, located along the cranial surface of the neuroectoderm (E- Fig. 14-1) . The neural plate is bordered on either side by neural folds, which eventually fuse dorsally to form the neural tube (i.e., the eventual brain, spinal cord, and ventricular system). Immature neuroepithelial cells that line the neural tube ultimately become the source of neurons, astrocytes, ependymal cells, and oligodendrocytes. Resident microglial cells arise from mesodermal stem cells in the yolk sac that migrate to the neural tube during development, whereas the development and maturation of the brain and spinal cord proceed through a series of coordinated mechanisms characterized by cellular proliferation and subsequent remodeling (e.g., apoptosis) to produce the final morphologic features of the adult brain and spinal cord.",

The white matter tracts of the spinal cord are further subdivided into funiculi, which contain variable numbers of ascending axons (i.e., action potential travels in the direction of the brain) and descending axons (i.e., action potential travels in the direction of the cauda equina). Segmentation (i.e., formation of the general regions of the brain and spinal cord) and stratification (i.e., formation of the lamina of the cerebral cortex) of the neural tube during embryologic development require a great deal more remodeling. Initial expansion of the neural tube results in a developing brain that is segmented into sections called the prosencephalon (forebrain), mesencephalon (midbrain), and rhombencephalon (hindbrain) (E-Box 14-1; . With further development the brain divides into the five segments: telencephalon, diencephalon (both derived from the prosencephalon), mesencephalon, and the metencephalon and myelencephalon (both derived from the rhombencephalon) (see E-Box 14-1). The telencephalon in the adult animal becomes paired cerebral hemispheres. The diencephalon becomes the thalamus and its associated structures. The mesencephalon gives rise to the corpora quadrigemina (superior and inferior colliculi) and the cerebral peduncles. The pons and cerebellum arise from the metencephalon, and lastly the medulla oblongata arises from the myelencephalon (see E -Fig 14-1) . Concurrently, the spinal cord is segmented into cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral sections, which are further subdivided into individual spinal nerves.",

For example, the brainstem (pons and medulla) undergoes marked reorganization to form numerous and also may communicate with the ventricular system. The defect may contain CSF. Radiculoneuritis (polyradiculoneuritis)-Inflammation of a spinal nerve rootlet (or rootlets). Rarefaction-Reduction in density of CNS tissue that may result from edema, necrosis, and the like. This lesion is usually observed microscopically. Satellite cells-Glial cells that cover the surface of nerve cell bodies in sensorimotor, autonomic, and enteric ganglia. Satellitosis-An accumulation of oligodendroglia around neuronal cell bodies. Although this feature can be seen in normal brains, some consider that it may also be associated with neuronal injury. Sclerosis-Literally means induration or hardening and, when used in describing lesions of the CNS, often refers to induration or hardening of the brain or spinal cord resulting from astrogliosis (astrocytic scar formation). Spina bifida-A dorsal midline defect involving one to several vertebrae of the spinal column caused by failure of the neural tube to close, permitting exposure of the underlying meninges and spinal cord. The lesion may be associated with herniation of meninges alone or meninges and spinal cord tissue into a sac (-cele) covered by skin, or there may be no herniation (spina bifida occulta). Status spongiosus-An encompassing term meaning the presence of small focal, ovoid to round \"clear (unstained or poorly stained [H&E stain])\" spaces in the CNS. The lesion can result from several different tissue alterations, which include splitting of the myelin sheath, accumulation of extracellular fluid, swelling of cellular (e.g., astrocytic and neuronal) processes, and axonal injury (Wallerian degeneration) when swollen axons are no longer detectable within distended spaces. Syringomyelia-A tubular cavitation (syrinx) in the spinal cord that is not lined by ependyma and may extend over several segments. Wallerian degeneration-Degeneration of the distal component of an injured (compressed or severed) axon. Although the term originally referred to injury of axons in the PNS, current usage also includes the CNS. This process also results in functional and structural alterations in the cell body (central chromatolysis) and proximal internode segment of the axon, and in secondary demyelination.",

Neurons vary in size, shape, and function, and their cell bodies are organized into functional groups such as nuclei, horns of gray matter in the spinal cord, and cerebral lamina. Neuronal processes called axons and dendrites traverse through the brain and spinal cord, the former often as organized bundles (tracts, fasciculi) forming synapses on cell bodies, dendrites, and axons of other functionally related neurons. It is estimated that there are 1 \u00d7 10 11 neurons in the human brain. Each neuron makes approximately 10,000 synapses with other neurons; therefore there are approximately 1 \u00d7 10 15 synapses in the human brain. The neurons maintain a close association with various glial cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. The glia are responsible for helping to maintain CNS homeostasis and play an important role in the immune response and healing. Astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells are derived from neuroectoderm, whereas microglia, part of the monocyte-macrophage system, are derived from progenitors in the embryonic yolk sac that populate the CNS during development. In the mammalian CNS, glia outnumber neurons 10 to 1. Ependymal cells line the ventricular system, whereas choroid plexus epithelial cells form the outer covering of the choroid plexuses. Lastly, the exterior of the CNS is covered by the meninges. The meninges consist of three layers named, from outermost to innermost layers, the dura mater, arachnoid, and pia mater. The arachnoid and pia enclose the subarachnoid space.",

Lamina are distinct topographic layers of neuron cell bodies that have similar functions and innervate specific areas of the body as designated by these similar functions. They serve as topographic maps for specific activities within the CNS such as sensory, motor, and associative functions. Additionally, these activities are spread out into distinct \"functional\" lamina within lobes within the cerebral cortex, such as the frontal lobe (cognitive functions), parietal lobe (motor and sensory functions), occipital lobe (vision), and the temporal lobe (auditory functions).

A population of neural crest cells that form bilaterally in the dorsal regions of the neural tube is the origin of the majority of cells that populate the PNS, such as neurons and Schwann cells. These neural crest cells also migrate peripherally in developing tissues and organ systems within the mesoderm and endoderm to form structures such as spinal ganglia, enteric plexuses, and the adrenal medullas. Neurons of the PNS are divided into afferent and efferent types based on whether they conduct impulses to or from the CNS, respectively. Cell bodies for somatic efferent neurons, such as those in cranial or spinal nerves, are located in nuclei of the brain or the ventral horns of the gray matter of the spinal cord and project ventrolaterally long distances to innervate peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle. The cell bodies for somatic afferent neurons are located bilaterally within spinal ganglia (dorsal root ganglia) that are developmentally associated with specific spinal cord segments. The neurogenic control of visceral tissues and organ systems such as the alimentary system is complex; involves at a minimum two neurons, a preganglionic neuron and a postganglionic neuron; and is facilitated by the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous systems (i.e., visceral nervous systems). As a basic rule, for all three visceral nervous systems the preganglionic neuron cell body is located in the intermediate gray matter between the dorsal and ventral horns of the spinal cord or brain nucleus.",

When the axon lacks myelin, the flow of depolarization down the axon is called continuous conduction. When the axon is myelinated, the speed of conduction is determined by the degree of myelination of the axon and is called saltatory conduction.

In unmyelinated axons, action potentials are conducted at a relatively \"slower\" velocity by the process of ion exchange (continuous conduction). In myelinated axons, action potentials are conducted at a relatively \"faster\" velocity by a mechanism called saltatory conduction.

CSF is secreted by the choroid plexuses in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. It should be noted, however, that fluid from other sources, such as secretion by the ependyma, interstitial fluid of the brain, and ultrafiltrate of the blood, has also been reported to contribute to the formation of CSF. It moves from the lateral ventricles into the third ventricle, from the third ventricle through the mesencephalic aqueduct (aqueduct of Sylvius in human beings), and then to the fourth ventricle. Once in the fourth ventricle, the CSF exits through the two lateral apertures of the fourth ventricle to enter the subarachnoid space. Lateral apertures are the two openings in the caudal medullary velum that forms the roof of the fourth ventricle into the subarachnoid space, one at each side of the cerebellopontine angle. Although the central canal of the spinal cord is connected to the ventricular system at the caudal end of the fourth ventricle, there apparently is little active movement of CSF within the central canal. CSF in the subarachnoid space is reabsorbed by the arachnoid villi in the meninges. Recent evidence indicates that other routes of CSF drainage, in addition to arachnoid granulations, also exist and vary in different species. Venous sinuses, lymphatic drainage, and the cribriform plate appear to play important roles in CSF drainage and the maintenance of normal interventricular CSF pressure. In fact, experimental evidence suggests that the cribriform plate route may be the most important of the four.

Because neurons lack adequate intracellular glucose reserves, they are completely dependent for survival on an adequate blood supply to provide glucose. Additionally, neurons are vulnerable to free radical oxidative stresses and have a limited ability to buffer shifts of calcium ions into the cell, which can interfere with oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, such as occurs with ischemia. The meninges, from outside to inside, are the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater as illustrated in the diagram. The arachnoid mater and the pia mater form the leptomeninges. These two layers of the leptomeninges also enclose the subarachnoid space, which contains the arteries, veins, and nerves and is filled with cerebrospinal fluid. The pia mater is attached to the surface of the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes and their foot processes underlie the pia mater and form the glia limitans (inset 1) and surround the endothelial cells that form the bloodbrain barrier. As arterioles penetrate the cortex to supply the tissue with blood, they carry the pia and glia limitans with them for 1 to 3 mm until the arteriole structurally becomes a capillary. At this transition site within the cortex, the capillary penetrates the pia and is surrounded by the glia limitans, and the end feet of the astrocytes become part of the blood-brain barrier (inset 2). Components of the blood-brain barrier are capillary endothelial cells, basement membrane, and astrocytic foot processes, but the barrier is formed structurally by tight junctions between endothelial cells and functionally by specialized transport systems in these cells.

Such conditions include (1) interference with cytochrome oxidase activity in mitochondria caused by cyanide poisoning, (2) competitive inhibition of oxygen uptake in carbon monoxide poisoning, and (3) inadequate availability of glucose for neuronal metabolism in hypoglycemia.",

However, within groups of neurons, some neurons are more sensitive to injury than others. This phenomenon is called selective neuronal vulnerability. Purkinje cells; some striatal neurons; neurons of the third, fifth, and sixth cerebral cortical lamina; and hippocampal pyramidal cells have the highest vulnerability. A regional vulnerability of neurons has also been reported (cerebral cortex and striatum > thalamus > brainstem > spinal cord). It is hypothesized that the most vulnerable neurons likely produce the most excitotoxins, such as glutamate, and are the most sensitive to them. Because of the microanatomic arrangement of the cerebral cortex, ischemic neurons often occur in a laminar pattern within the cerebrocortical gray matter. This microanatomic pattern accounts for the laminar lesions observed in thiamine deficiency-induced polioencephalomalacia in ruminants and in other diseases such as salt poisoning in pigs and lead poisoning in ruminants. Immunohistochemical stains for neuronal specific markers (e.g., neuronal nuclei) often delineate a linear pattern of neuronal necrosis better than that observed with an H&E stain and histologic examination.",

These reactive oxygen species, exerting their effects especially on lipid-rich cell membranes, can enhance the existing excitotoxicity, cause further influx of calcium into cells as a result of membrane damage, and ultimately result in neuronal dysfunction and death. Additionally, reperfusion of ischemic tissue after the initial ischemic injury can enhance the generation of reactive oxygen metabolites, thus amplifying the tissue damage. Other influencing factors include the temperature of the brain at the time of ischemia, with lower temperatures (as little as 2\u00b0 C decrease) having a sparing effect and elevated temperatures having an enhanced effect on neuronal injury following ischemia. Neurons depend on a continuous supply of oxygen to remain viable, and if the supply is interrupted for several minutes, the vulnerable neurons as described previously degenerate. Ischemic cell change can also result from metabolic disturbances other than ischemia, such as in thiamine deficiency and cyanide toxicosis, which interferes with oxygen use. In H&E-stained sections the cytoplasm of the neuronal cell body is shrunken, deeply eosinophilic, and frequently sharply angular to triangular in shape ( Fig. 14-16) . The nucleus is reduced in size, often triangular, frequently assumes a central position in the cell, and is pyknotic. The nucleolus and Nissl substance are usually not detectable. Ischemia neurons die and are removed either by a process called neuronophagia, which is phagocytosis by resident microglial cells and recruited macrophages or by lysis (see Fig. 14-16 ). After neuronal necrosis there is swelling of perineuronal and perivascular astrocytic processes and eventual replacement of the space left by loss of the neuron cell body by astrocytes and their processes.",

This loss, termed simple neuronal atrophy, is seen with slowly progressive neurologic diseases, such as cerebral cortical atrophy of aging, ceroid-lipofuscinosis, and various manifestations of selective or multisystem neuronal degeneration. Gross lesions are usually not visible, but when cerebrocortical neurons die, there can be atrophy of cerebral gyri, which results in widening of the sulci (Fig. 14-17 ). Microscopic lesions indicative of an earlier now refer to as Wallerian degeneration. Although Waller described this process in peripheral nerves, the term Wallerian degeneration is also used to describe necrosis that occurs in nerve fibers in the CNS after axons are injured (compressed or severed). Focal damage to a nerve fiber results in decreased or halted axonal transport, which manifests most prominently as segmental swellings in the axon called spheroids . Eventually the axon's myelin degenerates, forming areas of vacuolation into which macrophages infiltrate and digest the now necrotic axonal and myelin debris (forming digestion chambers). In the neuronal cell body of the damaged axon, lesions include swelling of the neuronal cell body, peripheral displacement of the nucleus, and dispersion of centrally located Nissl substance (central chromatolysis) (Fig. 14-19 ). It must be stressed that this is only one of several ways in which chromatolysis can develop. Chromatolytic neurons can also be found in a wide variety of neurologic diseases including viral infection and degenerative diseases like equine motor neuron disease. The development of Wallerian degeneration is directly related to the diameter of the axon, with a larger axon undergoing a faster rate of Wallerian degeneration.",

Neurons with the highest metabolic rate, such as some neurons in the cerebral cortex, will die 6 to 10 minutes after the cessation of blood flow after cardiac arrest. 2. There is no regeneration of neurons. The neurons you have now are the ones you were born with; however, their metabolism is dynamic, and metabolites are continually turned over and replaced. 3. If nerve fibers in the CNS are cut by transection of the cord, no or little regeneration of nerve fibers results. Therefore if sufficient motor nerve fibers are cut, there is paralysis; if not, there is a neurologic deficit. 4. If fibers in the PNS are cut, they can regenerate under certain circumstances. This outcome depends on axoplasmic flow, alignment of the proximal and distal portions of the nerve, and the preservation and alignment of the proximal and distal portions of the endoneurial tube (the structure in which the axon lies). 5.

Superficial wounds or wounds that extend through the leptomeninges heal by synthesis and deposition of collagen by fibroblasts (fibrous connective tissue) and by proliferation of astrocytic processes. However, in contrast to the fibroblast, astrocytic processes produce a very poor capsule, which can break down easily. 6. The cranial cavity is nearly filled by the brain, its coverings, and fluids. Therefore many lesions, such as tumors, abscesses, hemorrhages, and hydrocephalus in the brain, produce clinical signs because they are space-occupying lesions, which in neuropathology implies that they cause atrophy or displacement of portions of the brain or cord, depending on the duration of the injury. 7. The blood-brain barrier can exert control over drugs and antibodies and prevent them from entering the intact brain. It is also a barrier to infection and is formed by the tight junctions of the endothelial cells, aided by basement membrane, and the end feet of the astrocytes, which lie on the outside of the capillary. 8. Although the CNS has the ability to resist infection and injury, once the CNS is infected, it has a low degree of resistance when compared with other tissues of the body. Microbes, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, which normally would be relatively nonpathogenic in other organs, may produce death if the CNS is infected.

It might instead be the site of separation of an enlarged axon from the adjacent axon at the level of the section being examined. CHAPTER 14 Nervous System If injury is severe, astrocytic processes fragment and disappear followed by lysis of the cell body. Hypertrophied astrocytes, often referred to as reactive, represent a response to a milder and more protracted injury to the CNS. Because of increases in intermediate filaments, mainly GFAP, the cytoplasm becomes apparent along with increased length and branching of the processes with H&E staining. The increase of intermediate filaments and consequently the intensity of GFAP immunohistochemical staining in these cells are so dramatic that some have defined reactive astrocytes on the basis of this change. In protracted degenerative or reparative conditions, astrocytes termed gemistocytes can be observed (Fig. 14-20) . These cells have eccentric nuclei and abundant pink homogeneous cytoplasm, in contrast to the lack of visible cytoplasm in normal astrocytes, with routine H&E staining. Animals with hepatic and, less commonly, renal encephalopathy can have a unique microscopic lesion in the brain affecting astrocytes of the cerebral cortices. In these types of encephalopathies, astrocytic nuclei tend to be in pairs, triplets, quartets, or more occasionally with prominent central nucleoli and are surrounded by a clear space, which is the edematous cytoplasm. They are called Alzheimer's type II astrocytes (see D) .",

The astrocytes that form regions of astrogliosis are more commonly fibrillary in appearance. In large numbers they may form a glial scar, which is a network of interlaced astrocytic processes and provides a loose barrier that separates the injured brain from the more normal adjacent tissue.

Astrocytes swell after ischemia because of the increased uptake of sodium, chloride, and potassium ions and water in an effort to maintain homeostasis in the extracellular microenvironment. It is important to remember that such swelling depends on the astrocyte being viable and still having a semipermeable plasma membrane, even though its function may be altered. With progression and if the degree and duration of ischemia are sufficiently severe to result in cell death, the plasma membrane becomes fully permeable, and the cell does not swell but becomes shriveled or shrunken and undergoes disintegration, as described for the ischemic cell change of neurons. demyelination. Primary demyelination is the loss of myelin around an intact axon and results in the alteration of the conduction velocity of an action potential down the axon, leading to clinical dysfunction ( Fig. 14-21 ). Mechanisms of primary demyelination are summarized in Box 14-4. Protracted or repetitive injury to myelinating cells and their myelin sheaths can lead to irreversible neuronal atrophy. Oligodendroglia precursor cells located in the subventricular zone of the CNS can mature into interfascicular oligodendroglia and can also proliferate in response to noncytocidal injury and become involved in remyelination after primary demyelination. CNS or PNS injury can also lead to loss of myelin secondary to injury of the axon and its cell body or to death of the neuron. When axons are injured, myelin lamellae forming the internodes are retracted and removed by phagocytosis. In some instances, oligodendroglia or Schwann cells, the myelin-forming cells in the PNS, also degenerate. This form of myelin degeneration is termed secondary demyelination and is secondary to axon degeneration or loss (resembles Wallerian degeneration). Ependymal Cells. Ependymal and choroid plexus epithelial cell responses to injury include atrophy, degeneration, and necrosis. Compression of ependymal cells lining the ventricles followed by atrophy usually occurs in response to enlargement of the ventricles as occurs with hydrocephalus. The cilia and microvilli of affected cells are reduced in number, and there is also a reduction in their cellular organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. An additional lesion that accompanies ventricular enlargement is stretching and tearing of the ependymal lining. In such instances the resulting areas of ependymal discontinuity result in the subependymal CNS being directly exposed to the CSF. Unfortunately, mammalian ependymal cells do not regenerate and therefore do not repair the denuded areas. After 1 to 2 injury has not been definitively clarified. Microscopically, these cells swell and hypertrophy around injured neurons; this response to injury has been called satellitosis, although other glial cells can also contribute to satellitosis (see Fig. 14-10, B) .",

After injury, microglia progress through a stage of activation, becoming fully immunocompetent reactive cells. These reactive cells readily proliferate, either focally, forming glial nodules (Fig. 14-22) , or more diffusely, depending on the nature of the injury. As mentioned, in concert with astrocytes and neurons, microglia help coordinate inflammatory events in the CNS. Resident microglia and bloodderived macrophages express major histocompatibility complex class I and II antigens, serve as antigen-presenting cells, and possess a broad armament of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. Once activated, these cells can also produce nitric oxide, reactive oxygen intermediates, and other chemical mediators of inflammation that can damage the CNS if not under strict control. When tissue necrosis occurs, macrophages derived from blood monocytes phagocytose the lipid-laden debris of dead neurons, parenchyma, and glial remnants and accumulate in the damaged CNS.

Microbes most commonly gain entrance to the ependyma via the circulation by lodging in the choroid plexuses, by direct contamination from a rupture of a cerebral abscess into the ventricular system, and by retrograde reflux through the lateral apertures of infected CSF from the subarachnoid space in cases of leptomeningitis. In the case of bacterial infection the suppurative exudate that forms in the CSF can cause obstructive hydrocephalus, although the development of hydrocephalus cannot always be explained solely on the basis of obstruction. A, When astrocytes react to injury, initially by hypertrophy and later by the synthesis of increased glial filaments (astrogliosis), the nuclei enlarge and often the cell body, which is not normally visible in H&E-stained sections, will become visible. This type of reactive astrocyte is called a gemistocyte (plump astrocyte) (arrows). They occur in diseases in which there is alteration of intracellular and extracellular fluid balances or injury to the parenchyma, where healing will be by glial scarring (astrogliosis, e.g., to encapsulate a deep abscess or fill in a small area of dead space). H&E stain. B, Gemistocytes (arrows) are identified by immunohistochemical staining Infarction. Infarction means necrosis of a tissue after obstruction (ischemia) of its arterial blood supply. The rate at which ischemia occurs in the CNS determines the degree of injury that follows. The more rapid the onset of ischemia, the more severe the lesion. However, if the obstruction is sudden, as caused by an embolus, many of the neurons can die within minutes and other components within hours (Fig. 14-24 ). This outcome also applies to compressive injuries to the CNS that produce a sudden reduction in blood flow, such as can happen with sudden compression in rapidly occurring Hansen type I disk herniation in the dog. If the blood flow through an artery is gradually reduced, for example, because of atherosclerosis, there is often sufficient time for anastomotic vessels to dilate and compensate. Anastomoses of the arteries that penetrate from the ventral and cortical surfaces of the brain are insufficient to prevent infarction after sudden occlusion of one or more of these arteries. If the compression is slow-such as is caused by a slowly developing diameter of vessels at the interface. These changes may make endothelial cells more susceptible to injury, vasculitis, and thrombosis or predispose the vessels to entrapment of tumor or bacterial emboli.",

Injury resulting in endothelial dysfunction can include the activation and release of vasoactive mediators, such as histamine, leading to local and/or systemic changes in vascular flow, pressure, and permeability. Bacterial products and elicited inflammatory cytokines can directly or indirectly cause vascular inflammation (vasculitis) leading to thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Thrombotic meningoencephalitis of cattle caused by the bacterium Histophilus somni is an example of this type of injury (see Fig. 14-89) . Certain herpesviruses and protozoa can also infect endothelial cells and cause endothelial necrosis with vasculitis, hemorrhage, and thrombosis. Finally, some pathogens, such as angioinvasive fungi, directly invade blood vessels, resulting in necrosis of the endothelium. Vasculitis resulting in thrombosis can cause tissue ischemia, infarction, and vasogenic edema of the affected area of the CNS. A review of endothelial The speed of the conduction process is determined by the diameter of the axon and the degree of myelination. As axons increase in diameter, the resistance to ion flow decreases, allowing the action potential to flow faster. In addition, the degree of myelination is directly proportional to the diameter of the axon. Thus the concept that the more myelin the faster the speed of the impulse is true up to the point in which the myelin is normal in thickness. For an axon whose myelin is reduced, conduction of the action potential is slower. Under normal conditions, locomotion is a well-coordinated event that requires precise timing (speed) of impulse conduction to get coordinated movements. If the speed of the action potential is altered by disease, especially demyelination, then the conduction of the action potential will be delayed, and what are normally coordinated movements become uncoordinated. A, In unmyelinated axons, action potentials are conducted at a relatively \"slower\" velocity by the process of ion exchange continuous conduction (see E- Fig. 14-4) . B, In myelinated axons, action potentials are conducted at a relatively \"faster\" velocity by a mechanism called saltatory conduction. Optimal function of saltatory conduction is dependent on having the proper degree of myelination of the axon (as determined by axonal diameter) throughout the full length of the axon. C, In axons that have lost some but not all of their myelin lamellae from one or more internodes so that there is a \"thinner\" covering of myelin, the speed of saltatory conduction is reduced because of leakage of the action potential across this thinner myelin sheath, resulting in clinical dysfunction of the nervous system. D, In axons that have lost all of their myelin from one or more internodes (complete primary demyelination of the internode), the speed of saltatory conduction is reduced because of the conversion from saltatory conduction to ion exchange continuous conduction in the areas where internodes have lost their myelin. Thus the speed and timing of the action potential is substantially reduced, leading to clinical dysfunction of the nervous system. ",

See Table 14 -1 for the reparative responses associated with the resolution of infarcts. Although they occur through the same mechanisms, areas of cerebral infarction differ somewhat in gross appearance from infarcts in other tissues (Fig. 14-25 ). The abundance of lipids and enzymes, plus the relative lack of fibrous connective tissue stroma in the brain and spinal cord, results in the affected areas eventually becoming soft because of liquefaction necrosis. The gross appearance of infarction may also differ according to location. Lesions affecting the gray matter tend to be hemorrhagic, whereas infarction of the white matter is often pale. This difference is probably due in part to the less-dense capillary meshwork in the white matter because vessels supplying the white matter have fewer anastomoses than those of the gray matter.

Other types of cerebral edema have been identified as hydrostatic (or interstitial) edema associated with increased hydrostatic pressure of the CSF (resulting from obstructive internal hydrocephalus) and hypo-osmotic edema, which is dependent on development of an abnormal osmotic gradient between the blood and nervous tissue. The types of edema in the CNS are summarized in Table 14 -2.

Congestive brain swelling, as distinguished from cerebral edema, partially represents unregulated vasodilation after trauma, and it can cause serious brain damage (even more severe than the primary injury) if not properly controlled. This lesion therefore represents an enlargement of the brain resulting in elevated intracranial pressure caused by the increased diameter of the blood-containing vasculature, whereas edema results in an increased pressure following accumulation of fluid in the interstitium or intracellularly outside the circulation. Acute brain swelling can be localized (usually of lesser significance) when associated with focal lesions or generalized (often serious) when caused by diffuse brain injury. Although rarely seen in domestic animals, one exception to the importance of focal lesions is extracerebral hemorrhage (acute subdural hematoma in human beings), which-though Cytotoxic edema is characterized by the accumulation of fluid intracellularly (in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and endothelial cells) as a result of altered cellular metabolism, often caused by ischemia.

The fluid taken up by the swollen cells is primarily derived from the extracellular space, which becomes reduced in size and has an increased concentration of extracellular solutes. However, for this lesion to be described accurately as cerebral edema, there must be additional fluid movement into the brain and not merely a change of existing fluid from extracellular to intracellular compartments. In practical terms, this is not always the case and can be difficult to determine. The term cytotoxic edema has been used rather loosely to refer simply to cellular swelling in many cases. Additional fluid may originate from the circulation by way of the transcapillary fluid exchange or possibly from the CSF, which has extensive diffusional communication with the extracellular fluid of the brain. The blood-brain barrier remains intact during development of this type of edema, so fluid does not enter the brain by a disturbance in vascular permeability. Specific causes of this lesion include hypoxia-ischemia, particularly in the early stages; blood-brain barrier that results in movement of plasma constituents, such as water, ions, and organic osmolytes, and proteins into the perivascular extracellular space, particularly that of the white matter ( Fig. 14-27 ). In addition to extracellular accumulation of fluid, vasogenic edema can also be accompanied by some cellular swelling involving astrocytes. Vasogenic edema with the resulting accumulation of extracellular fluid can cause an increase in intracranial pressure within the CNS. This pressure can also be so severe as to cause neurologic dysfunction and caudal displacement of brain structures such as the parahippocampal gyri and cerebellar vermis (see Figs. 14-59 and 14-60).",

These genes control the spatial and temporal expression of proteins in the extracellular microenvironment that subsequently bind to receptors on migrating cells. Patterns of cell membrane binding signals are interpreted by migrating cells and are reflected in their movements by changes in intracellular cytoskeletal reorganization.

Type I porencephaly is caused by vascular injury or vasculitis. Injury, resulting in infarction in the area of the subependymal germinal matrix, results in the formation of a cyst within the focus of dead cells and effete erythrocytes. The germinal matrix is very sensitive to ischemia because of sparse stroma, delicate vasculature, and high metabolism. The initial focus of hemorrhage can grow by centripetal expansion, depending on the severity of hemorrhage and hypoxia, into a cyst of considerable size. Type II porencephaly is caused by injury of neuroblasts in the germinal matrix and the failure of these neuroblasts to migrate within pressure gradient into the central canal and into the syrinx. It has also been suggested that pressure differences in the vertebral column cause CSF to continually move into the cyst, resulting in enlargement of the syrinx and additional compressive damage to the spinal cord.",

As the hydrocephalus progresses, atrophy with fenestration and cavity formation of the interventricular septum (septum pellucidum), atrophy of the hippocampus in the floor of the lateral ventricles, and flattening of cortical gyri can occur. If the obstruction is abrupt and pressure builds rapidly, the cerebral hemispheres can be displaced caudally, causing herniation of the parahippocampal gyri under the tentorium cerebelli and of the vermis of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum. The resulting coning of the cerebellum can be accompanied by hemorrhage and necrosis of cells in the cerebellar folia as a result of ischemia and infarction.

This may occur either from direct extension or hematogenously. With direct extension, abscesses occur following penetrating wounds, such as calvarial fractures, or from spread of infection from adjacent tissues, such as the meninges, paranasal sinuses, and internal ear, and through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid (see Fig. 14-29 ). Diseases that cause bacteremia or septicemia result in infectious microbes being trapped in vascular beds within the CNS and meninges. Abscesses usually arise within gray matter because it receives a disproportionate share of blood flow in the CNS, usually at the gray-white (cortex-subcortical white matter) junction. They exert effects in the CNS by disruption and destruction of tissue and by displacement as space-occupying lesions. If the abscess grows quickly, tissue is more likely to be disrupted and destroyed and in the worst case penetrate the wall of the lateral ventricle and cause a ventriculitis. Bacteria in the CSF may be carried into the subarachnoid space and cause a leptomeningitis. On the other hand, if growth is slow, tissue is more likely to be displaced. Chronic abscesses become encapsulated by either fibrous tissue if they are close to the leptomeninges or by astrocytes away from the meninges. The mechanism of tissue injury is likely a secondary bystander effect related to the actions of the mediators of inflammation and the toxins and other products elaborated from bacteria. Bacteria appear to localize in specific areas of the CNS based on receptor-mediated attachment or because of vascular flow patterns unique to the gray matter-white matter interface of the CNS that allow bacteria to attach to and move through the blood-brain barrier. This latter flow mechanism likely occurs because small blood vessels supplying the cerebrum fail to continue into the white matter and end with their horizontal branches running parallel to the surface of the gyrus within the gray matter at the interface with the white matter. Once within the CNS or meninges, bacteria replicate and elicit an inflammatory response. Lytic enzymes released from lysosomes of neutrophils and other inflammatory cytokines secreted by lymphocytes and macrophages destroy neurons and their processes and disrupt synapses, thus affecting neurotransmission.",

Borna disease virus has been classified as the prototype of a relatively new virus family, Bornaviridae. It most commonly infects horses and sheep, but cases have also been reported in dogs, cats, and cattle. Borna disease virus infection in horses was originally considered to result in a high mortality, up to 80% to 100% after 1 to 3 weeks of clinical illness. More recent evidence indicates that the majority of infected animals are either asymptomatic or have mild clinical disease that can be accompanied by behavioral changes, followed by recovery. The clinically severe disease in the horse is still largely confined to certain regions in Germany and Switzerland; the asymptomatic infection, which probably also occurs in other species, including human beings, is considered to have a worldwide distribution. Proposed peripheral spread of virus by axonal transport in the autonomic and enteric divisions of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) has led to the suggestion that infection of these neurons might cause lesions responsible for colic and other gastroenteric dysfunctions in horses.",

Negri bodies also tend to occur more frequently in large neurons such as the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus (most common in carnivores, like the dog), neurons of the medulla oblongata, and rabies is that infection of nervous and nonnervous tissue, such as the salivary glands, occur at the same time, which permits affected animals to have the required aggressive behavior plus passage of the virus into the saliva to facilitate the transmission of the disease.",

After axoplasmic spread of the virus from an inoculated rear leg to neurons of the associated segments of the spinal cord, rapid spread of infection to the brain occurs via long ascending and descending fiber tracts, bypassing the gray matter of the rostral spinal cord. This early spread of the virus has been suggested to explain how induction of behavioral changes occurs before there is sufficiently severe injury to cause paralysis and allows dissemination of infection before there is time for a notable immune response. Spread of infection within neurons of the CNS occurs via both anterograde and retrograde axoplasmic flow, with corresponding neuron-to-neuron spread by axosomatic-axodendritic and somatoaxonal-dendroaxonal transfer of virus. Transsynaptic spread can occur by budding of developing virions from the neuronal cytoplasm (cell body or dendrite) into a synapsing axon or in the form of bare viral nucleocapsid (ribonucleoprotein-transcriptase complexes) in the absence of a complete virion.",

In the CNS, microscopic lesions are prominently associated with blood vessels along which the parasite apparently migrates. an inherited mutation of the normal human prion gene. In animals the primary route of infection appears to be through horizontal transmission. For chronic wasting disease, horizontal transmission is surprisingly effective, and prions can be readily transmitted in saliva, blood, and urine. It has been proposed that prions ingested in infective feedstuffs enter the body through the intestine. Prions cross the intestinal wall at Peyer's patches and are phagocytosed and transported to other lymph nodes by leukocytic trafficking. Prions replicate in lymphocytes and macrophages of the lymphoid system before gaining access to the blood. The autonomic nervous system is important in delivering the prions to the CNS and neurons; however, the exact mechanisms of spread remain to be elucidated. Eventually neurons accumulate sufficient PrP Sc to alter the normal function (it can take years), and neurologic signs are observed. Prion diseases are fatal. The adaptive immune system does not recognize prions as foreign; therefore no immunologic protection develops. How the accumulation of PrP Sc causes neurodegeneration conserved gene found in microbes as diverse as fruit flies and human beings.

            "text": "Hepatic Encephalopathy. Acute and chronic liver failure, as well as hepatic atrophy associated with congenital or acquired vascular shunts, often results in hepatic encephalopathy and disordered neurotransmission because of the accumulation of toxic substances, principally ammonia, in the systemic circulation and thus the CNS. Ammonia is formed in the gastrointestinal tract by bacterial degradation of amines, amino acids, purines, and urea from proteins consumed in the diet. In healthy animals, ammonia is detoxified in the liver by conversion to urea by the ornithine citrulline arginine urea cycle. Urea is far less toxic than ammonia and is excreted in the urine. Ammonia has several neurotoxic effects such as (1) changing the transit of amino acids, water, and electrolytes across the neuronal cell membranes and (2) inhibiting the generation of both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in neurons. Ammonia and other toxic metabolites also (1) cause increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, leading to vasogenic edema, and (2) alter osmoregulation within the CNS. These mechanisms likely led to the spongy change (status spongiosus) characteristic of the disease microscopically. Because astrocytes play an important role in regulating fluid and electrolyte balances in the CNS and are the primary cell type having lesions of the CNS in which neuronal dysfunction and eventual loss occurs. An example of cortical atrophy is seen in cerebral ceroidlipofuscinosis, a storage disorder that occurs in many different species. Atrophy most frequently involves the cerebral hemispheres, especially the cortex. The cerebral hemispheres are increased in firmness and often have a tan color (lipofuscin), gyri are thinned, and the sulci widened. Microscopically, there is loss of neuron cell bodies in cortical laminae without inflammation. Astrogliosis in response to neuronal loss is also observed, as is an increased prominence of the adventitial layer of blood vessels.",

In human beings, neurologic diseases, such as epilepsy and migraine headaches, have been attributed to channelopathies. In veterinary neurology, channelopathies will likely be shown in the future to be the underlying mechanism for epilepsy and other primary neuronal degenerations; however, investigation into this type of neurologic disorder is still in its infancy in veterinary medicine.

Recent research indicates that glutamine, although a normal breakdown product, may actually have deleterious effects on astrocytes and may be one of the main contributors to astrocyte dysfunction noted in hyperammonemic states. Ammonia and other toxic metabolites likely also affect oligodendroglia. Finally, it has been proposed that alterations in the bloodbrain barrier may facilitate passage of neurotoxins such as short-chain fatty acids, mercaptans, false (pseudo-) neurotransmitters (tyramine, octopamine, and \u03b2-phenylethanolamine), ammonia, and GABA into the CNS, leading to neuronal dysfunction.

Tetanospasmin is synthesized in anaerobic wounds and first binds at myoneural junctions and/or sensory receptors. It is transported via retrograde axoplasmic flow within the axon and across synaptic junctions until it reaches the CNS (see Fig. 4-28) . In the CNS the toxin is transferred across synapses until it becomes fixed to gangliosides in the presynaptic inhibitory motor neuron. Tetanospasmin blocks the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters such as glycine and GABA. Inhibitory neurotransmitters act to dampen the actions of excitatory nerve impulses from upper motor neurons that are imposed on lower motor neurons. If these impulses cannot be dampened by normal inhibitory mechanisms, the generalized muscular spasms characteristic of tetanus ensue. Tetanospasmin appears to act by selective cleavage of a protein component of synaptic vesicles, thus preventing the release of neurotransmitters by the cells.

            "text": "Atherosclerotic plaques arise from a complex and partially understood interaction among endothelium, smooth muscle cells, platelets, T lymphocytes, and monocytes. Endothelial injury induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol results in vascular inflammation of the tunica intima. Monocytes migrate into the intima of the vessel wall to phagocytose LDL cholesterol. This process results in the formation of foam cells characteristic of early atherosclerosis (fatty streak). In addition, activated macrophages produce factors that also injure the endothelium. LDL cholesterol concentrations in foam cells and smooth muscle cells often exceed the antioxidant properties of normal endothelium. Oxidized LDL leads to additional metabolic changes that foster a procoagulant from Astragalus lentiginosus. Recent discoveries have pinpointed the fungal endophyte Undifilum oxytropis as the ultimate source of swainsonine. The swainsonine compounds inhibit lysosomal \u03b1-mannosidase, thus inducing an acquired \u03b1-mannosidosis that mimics the inherited storage disease mannosidosis. Mannosidases are glycoside-hydrolyzing enzymes that are found in the Golgi, lysosomes, and cytoplasm of all mammalian cells. Analyses of tissue from animals poisoned with swainsonine have shown that swainsonine is present in all tissue; however, neurons; epithelial cells in organ systems, such as the liver; and macrophages of the monocyte-macrophage system of the spleen and lymph nodes are commonly affected. Therefore, as occurs in the inherited storage disease (mannosidosis), acquired swainsonine-induced storage diseases affect similar cells throughout the body. Additionally, swainsonine interferes with normal synthesis of glycoproteins containing asparagine-linked complex oligosaccharides. Swainsonine also inhibits Golgi mannosidase II, an effect not recognized in the inherited disorder.",

The increased body hydration produces a hypotonic (hypo-osmolar) plasma, with subsequent development of an osmotic gradient between the hypotonic plasma and the relatively hypertonic state of the normal cerebral tissue. Fluid moves from the plasma into the brain. In this type of edema the blood-brain barrier remains intact.

Stress factors: Environmental stresses mediated through the CNS can depress the functions of the immune system, leading to the formation of autoantibodies. The mechanism of myelin breakdown in immune-mediated demyelination is not clearly understood. The initial step is thought to be exposure of antigens in myelin basic protein of the major dense line of myelin lamellae after injury. Myelin proteins are substrates for calpain, a calcium-activated neutral proteinase. Calpain has been implicated in several autoimmune diseases and may play an important role in CNS demyelination. Exposed antigens are then recognized by the immune system, and experimental studies suggest that lesions result from a complex interaction between inflammatory cells and their mediators and lamellae of myelinating cells. T lymphocytes, some B lymphocytes, and activated macrophages (recruited monocytes) and microglia cells, adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors have been demonstrated in the lesions.

The percentage of brain mass in relation to skull size is much less in domestic animals than in primates, and in the bovine and porcine species the cranial cavity is additionally protected dorsally by prominent frontal sinuses. Birth trauma, which can be important in human beings, is essentially insignificant in animals because in the latter, the shoulders and particularly the pelvis, rather than the head, are likely to be compressed in the birth canal. Exceptions to this generalization include brachycephalic breeds of dogs. Several factors also influence the susceptibility of the spinal cord to trauma. The amount of space between the spinal cord and the wall of the vertebral canal is very important in determining the degree of injury after edema or compression with disk herniation. This space is greater in the cervical area of the dog than at the thoracolumbar level. Thus disk herniation at the latter area is more likely to result in severe spinal cord injury. Diffuse brain injury (often present in concussion) is caused by acceleration/deceleration forces applied to many areas of the CNS rather than in one specific location. Diffuse brain injury involves neuronal processes, cell bodies, transmitter mechanisms, and macroglial cells and blood vessels. The most severe injury to axons appears to be at the gray matter-white matter junction. A variant of diffuse brain injury is diffuse axonal injury in which axons of large myelinated nerve fibers are injured by shearing forces. In diffuse brain and axonal injury, mechanical deformation results in physical disruption of cell membranes and cytoskeleton and increased membrane permeability, resulting in major ionic fluxes in and out of the cell. Such changes can lead to excessive release of glutamate, irritability, semiconsciousness with responsiveness only to noxious stimuli, and unconsciousness with no response to any stimulus. With spinal cord trauma, signs vary, depending on the severity of the injury and the rate of onset. Paralysis results from severance of the cord or ruptured disks. Paresis and ataxia result from less severe injury.",

The brain of a freely movable head is much more susceptible to injury than one that is fixed in place. The increased susceptibility of the former has been attributed to the ability of the cranium (the bone) and its contents (the brain) to impact each other after nonpenetrating trauma.

            "text": "The type and location of the lesion (contusion and/or hemorrhage) depends on the location of the point of contact and the direction of the blow, relative to the head. If the blow is directly on the back or front of the head, the head and brain will move straight forward or backward, respectively (see Fig. 14-66, axial force) . If the blow is horizontal to the top of the head or horizontal to the rostral portion, the head will rotate on the atlantooccipital axis (angularly and rotationally, respectively). In the case of an axial blow to the back of the head (an animal falling onto the back of its head), the head and thus the cranial vault will accelerate faster than the brain, which will lag behind, and the caudal aspect of the vault may move forward and contact the caudal aspect of the cerebral hemispheres, usually the occipital cortex. In the case of an animal falling onto the back of its head, the head will accelerate abruptly and the momentum will carry the brain caudally, where it may strike the inside of the caudal brain in the cranial vault. A vertical blow delivered directly down onto the dorsal surface of the head will have the same type of result on the dorsal aspect of the cerebral hemispheres as the blow to the back of the head. It is more common, from the same blows described previously, to see hemorrhage, usually subarachnoid, on the opposite side of the point of impact with the brain. For example, a vertical blow to the top of the head causes hemorrhage of the ventral surface of the medulla and cerebral hemispheres. Thus after an impact on a stationary, freely movable head, the bone of the cranial vault will move on the stationary brain and injure it (coup injury) and on the opposite side the nerves and blood vessels will be stretched, possibly resulting in nerve damage and hemorrhage (contrecoup injury). In addition, the mass and velocity of the object striking the head are important. Trauma after impact of a relatively large blunt object can create notable head movement and a large-impact injury, whereas a small object, such as a bullet moving at a high rate of speed, can cause less head movement and a smaller but deeper area of direct tissue damage. In summary, the basic concept is the transfer of kinetic energy by the striking object to the head. A large blunt object will cause the head to accelerate without deforming it; a smaller object, such as a bullet, will penetrate.",

In addition, a relative rotational gliding motion between the brain and skull is produced when the impact suddenly stops the skull's motion and rotation, thus creating an additive shearing stress because the fluid lubrication necessary to facilitate gliding of the brain over the cranial surface is reduced. The concentration of this rotational shearing stress is likely to occur beneath the frontal and temporal lobes because of the rough surface of the skull that exists in this location. In contrast to contrecoup injury, coup contusions occur infrequently in this type of fall. In such situations the brain lags away from the impact site, which results in a thickening of the protective CSF layer between the brain and skull immediately beneath the point of impact, which helps explain the absence of coup injury in primates and human beings in typical moving head trauma.",

With regard to falls from great heights, the dynamics involving rotation of the body about a fixed point of ground contact associated with a fall from a standing position do not occur. Because gravity produces no torque on a freely falling object, no angular acceleration of the body is produced; therefore such a fall is a true free-fall state that is associated with an absence of brain lag. For this reason, contrecoup lesions occur infrequently with this type of trauma. One point should be emphasized with regard to the evaluation of coup and contrecoup cortical contusions just described. Displacement of bone associated with skull fracture can contuse the subjacent brain, regardless of the resting or moving status of the head, and such fracture-contusions have nothing to do with the coup-contrecoup mechanisms described. Also, even though the basic mechanisms discussed earlier apply to human beings, they should also be considered when evaluating cerebral contusions of domestic animals, but the situation in human brains is made far more complex because of the numerous wide bony ridges that project into the cranial vault.",

Hemorrhage can be diffuse (see Fig. 14-67) or focal (e.g., hematomas) (Fig. 14-68) . Such hemorrhages can result from sliding of the brain over bony ridges rough surfaces on the inside of the cranial vault, and the development within the cranial cavity of positive and negative pressures and gravitational forces. The basic results of the different types of blows to the heads of animals have been discussed previously, and it is interesting to compare these with the lesions in human beings. Several neuropathologic principles have been generally accepted regarding craniocerebral contusive trauma in human beings, as follows: 1. A blow to the stationary (but freely movable) head produces a cerebrocortical coup contusion beneath the point of cranial impact, but with rare exceptions causes no cerebrocortical contrecoup contusion opposite the point of cranial impact. This outcome is not always true of animals, in which a blow to the dorsum of the head from a flat object, such as a spade, causes marked subarachnoid hemorrhage on the ventral surface (contrecoup). 2. An impact of a moving head (moving before impact, as in a fall from a standing position) against a firm or unyielding surface causes a cerebrocortical contrecoup contusion opposite the point of cranial collision (often at the poles and inferior surfaces of the frontal and temporal lobes), but with rare exceptions there is no contusion beneath the point of impact. In contrast, horses that fall backward and land on their backs and strike the occiput often have subarachnoid hemorrhage over the occipital poles of the cerebral hemispheres. 3. Falls from great heights and crushing of the head between a strong external force and unyielding surface are generally not associated with the occurrence of contrecoup lesions. Dawson and coworkers proposed a mechanism for both contrecoup and coup injury of the human brain that also addressed the specific deficiencies of mechanisms that have been advanced by others. An example explaining the mechanism of contrecoup injury states that when a person falls backward from a standing position because of loss of balance, the gravitational torque acting on the body causes downward acceleration of the head in excess of the acceleration as a result of gravity. Under these circumstances the brain lags toward the trailing anterior surface of the cranium before impact (causing displacement of the protective CSF layer between the brain and skull) and permits compressive stress to develop at this site, although impact occurs at the opposite side of the head. Because dissipation of the CSF at the anterior (contrecoup) site allows compressive stress to be focal at this contrecoup",

Central nervous tissue can tolerate a considerable degree of compression if it is applied slowly. Rapid compression can lead to quickly developing hypoxia-ischemia, necrosis, and direct damage to compressed axons. Lesions detected include a spectrum of changes characterized by axonal injury and disruption of myelin sheaths, resulting in Wallerian degeneration and necrosis of the gray or white matter or of both. Lesions can be visible grossly from the exterior but are more commonly seen on cross section of the spinal cord. compression can be caused by intervertebral disk herniation in the dog; cervical stenotic myelopathy (wobbler syndrome) in the horse and dog; vertebral fracture and dislocation; neoplasms of the meninges, such as the meningioma; nerve rootlets, such as nerve sheath tumors; or tumor metastasis, such as lymphosarcoma. Finally, developmental anomalies of bone, such as atlantooccipital malformation, and vertebral deformities with hemivertebrae, such as scoliosis, lordosis, and kyphosis (Fig. 14-70) , can result in compression of the spinal cord.",

They have been reported in horses, cattle, pigs, dogs, and cats and arise in the cerebellum, usually in close proximity to the vermis, and invade into adjacent structures. The cell of origin for the medulloblastoma has not been definitely determined. It has been proposed that the neoplasm arises from primitive cells originating in the neuroepithelial roof of the fourth ventricle that give rise Microscopically, particularly at the site of injury, there is initial swelling of axons followed after several days by loss of architecture of the CNS as a result of necrosis and a beginning accumulation of gitter cells that have phagocytosed the lipid-rich tissue debris. Eventually the necrotic area is cleared and a cystic space is formed, which is surrounded by varying degrees of astrocytosis and astrogliosis, although not usually prominent unless there is severe destruction. Rostral and caudal to this location, the lesion is primarily one of Wallerian degeneration in the white matter, and the pattern of lesion development seen depends on the level of the spinal cord that is examined relative to the site of compression. At the site of injury, all parts of the white and gray matter of the spinal cord are affected and often necrotic, if the compressive force is sufficient. Rostral to this site, white matter degeneration is generally limited to the ascending tracts in the dorsal funiculi and the superficial portions of the dorsolateral part of the lateral funiculi. Caudal to the area of injury, degeneration is limited to the descending tracts in the ventral funiculi, and the more central portions of the lateral funiculi. It should also be noted that (1) a lesion may occur at the point of compression because of ischemia, but a lesion can also occur on the opposite side of the compression also because of ischemia that results from compression of the tissue against bone on that side, and (2) Wallerian degeneration can be observed in distal segments of affected axons far from the point of compression within the spinal cord. In the former case, compressive forces can be transferred through the spinal cord to axons and blood vessels away from the contact point, whereas in the latter example, degeneration of the distal axon segments can extend for a length of centimeters to meters away from the point of contact.",

Based on their cytomorphologic features, the majority of these tumors can be subtyped as follows: (1) transitional; (2) meningothelial; (3) psammomatous; (4) fibrous; (5) atypical; or (6) malignant. The transitional, meningothelial, psammomatous, fibrous, and atypical subtypes appear to be the most common in the dog. In the cat, almost all meningiomas have features that are more typical of the meningothelial or transitional type with psammoma bodies being a common feature. Other less common subtypes include angiomatous, chordoid, microcystic, malignant, and papillary. Although cytomorphologic features of all subtypes are beyond the scope of this chapter, general features of the most common subtypes are mentioned here. The transitional subtype is composed of nests of polygonal to spindle cells arranged in whorls. The meningothelial variant is composed of cellular sheets lacking distinct morphologic characteristics, whereas the fibrous variant is composed of interlacing bundles of spindle cells. The psammomatous variant is characterized by a predominance of mineral concretions (psammoma bodies). Typically in these variants the neoplastic cells have large cell bodies with abundant cytoplasm, ill-defined cell boundaries, and elongated, oval, open-faced nuclei with peripherally located chromatin. The number of cells making up a whorl can vary from a few to many. Additional microscopic lesions include hemorrhage, foci of necrosis, and infiltrates of neutrophils.

The specific cause of the syndrome is not proved. A sesquiterpene lactone isolated from C. repens termed repin could provide a basis for the neurotoxicity.

The bacterium produces profound damage to endothelial cells, from which the majority of its thrombotic lesions develop. One of the primary bacterial virulence factors, lipooligosaccharide, has been shown in experimental studies to cause apoptosis of endothelial cells. This mechanism likely contributes to the profound damage of endothelial cells occurring with this disease.

Malignant catarrhal fever is usually a sporadic highly fatal disease of cattle and other ruminants, including deer, buffalo, and antelope, and can involve several animals in a herd. The disease has a worldwide distribution, and the clinicopathologic features do not differ significantly from one part of the world to another. The primary target tissues are the vasculature, lymphoid organs, and epithelium (particularly of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts), but the kidneys, liver, eyes, joints, and CNS can also be affected. The virus appears to be transferred between lymphoid tissue/cells and endothelial cells via leukocytic trafficking in T lymphocytes. Two general types of the disease occur, the sheep-associated and wildebeest-derived forms, although several other less common causes of the disease have also been described. The causative agents involved belong to the herpesvirus subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. The disease occurring outside Africa, caused by ovine herpesvirus 2, often involves close contact of presumed \"carrier\" sheep with susceptible ruminants. The disease has recently been reported in musk ox (Ovibos moschatus), Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana), and gemsbok (Oryx gazella). In Africa and occasionally in wildlife facilities outside the continent, the source of the infection is often severe, and the exudate is composed predominantly of mononuclear cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells) with fewer neutrophils.

Primary viral replication occurs in cells of monocyte-macrophagemicroglial lineage. Thus visna virus enters the CNS by way of leukocytic trafficking of virus-infected macrophages. Visna virus can also be present in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes located in foci of demyelination. Recent studies suggest the virus can also infect and productively replicate in endothelial cells.

Copper deficiency can be primarily the result of copper-deficient soils and inadequate intake from forage or secondary from defective absorption because of interactions between copper, molybdenum, zinc, cadmium, or inorganic sulfates. Copper is a component of several enzyme systems, including cytochrome and lysyl oxidases, such as mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase; dopamine \u03b2-monooxygenase; peptidylglycine \u03b1-amidating monooxygenase; tyrosinase; and superoxide dismutase and the protein ceruloplasmin. These enzyme systems are essential for energy generation by mitochondria in the brain, regulating There has been considerable interest in the relationship of high dietary sulfur to polioencephalomalacia. All sources of sulfur, including formulated rations, plants rich in sulfur (Kochia scoparia), and high concentrations of sulfur in the drinking water, are additive. Total dietary intake should not exceed 0.3% to 0.4%. The exact mechanism to explain sulfur-induced polioencephalomalacia in ruminants has not been proved but most likely involves interference with cytochrome oxidases thereby distrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain.",

After replication in the nasopharynx, virus invades sensory nerve endings and is then transported in axoplasm via the trigeminal ganglion and olfactory bulb to the brain. The virus has also been reported to be capable of spreading transsynaptically. Recent studies have additionally shown that some strains produce lesions in the gastrointestinal tract and myenteric plexuses, suggesting that infection might spread from the intestinal mucosa to the CNS via autonomic nerves. In latently infected pigs the oronasal epithelium can be recurrently infected by virus spreading from the nervous system, followed by its excretion in oronasal fluid. The virus can also spread hematogenously, although in low titer, to other tissues of the body. As an example, it can cause placenta disease in pregnant sows and is an important cause of fetal maceration and mummification in the pig.

Histologically, this disease causes distinct perivascular cuffs composed almost entirely of lymphocytes and macrophages with scattered numbers of plasma cells and neutrophils. These cuffs are almost entirely restricted to the white matter. The proportion of lymphocytes and macrophages can vary in affected foci. Macrophages are commonly epithelioid, and in chronic cases there is abundant deposition of reticulin and collagen in the affected perivascular regions (see Fig. 14-103, B) . The inflammatory lesion in granulomatous meningoencephalitis is predominantly CD3 + lymphocytes and perivascular accumulations of CD163 + macrophages. This observation has led to the suggestion that the underlying mechanism of the disease process is a T lymphocyte-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity of an organspecific autoimmune disease. Regardless, the cause of granulomatous meningoencephalitis has remained enigmatic, and various attempts to consistently isolate pathogens from affected dogs have proved fruitless. In old dogs the leptomeninges can have areas of fibrosis (white areas around blood vessels in sulci), particularly in the sulci. This lesion must not be confused with acute leptomeningitis and accumulation of exudate in the leptomeninges and subarachnoid space. In the latter the exudate extends into the sulci and also covers the gyri (see Fig. 14-43, A) . (Courtesy College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois.) Topographically, gross lesions are consistently observed in the midthoracic segments, with extension to the midcervical and midlumbar segments in the most severe cases. Gross lesions include softening and cavitation of the affected segments. Lesions are bilateral and symmetric regardless of the region affected. In the thoracic segments the ventral funiculi are most severely affected, although lesions can be found circumferentially around the spinal cord white matter. In the cervical and lumbar segments, the lesions tend to be focused either in the dorsal or ventral horns. Histologically, in severe lesions there is destruction of white matter, with an influx of macrophages accompanied by myelin degradation, glial cell loss, and vascular proliferation. The gray matter and the fasciculus proprius are typically spared in this disease. Neuronal cell bodies in spinal cord gray matter and ventral spinal nerve rootlets are similarly unaffected.",

It begins as early as 6 months of age, progresses rapidly, and results in the loss of elasticity of the nucleus pulposus. The loss of elasticity places additional mechanical stress forces on the annulus fibrosus, which itself is experiencing degenerative changes similar to those occurring in the nucleus pulposus. The annulus fibrosus is thinnest and thus weakest at its point of contact with the spinal canal. If the annulus fibrosus is ruptured after stress forces placed on the disk by movement, such as jumping downward from a chair, fragments of the nucleus pulposus can be released into the spinal canal (Hansen type I herniation). If the annulus fibrosus ruptures dorsally, fragments compress the ventral funiculi of the spinal cord. If the annulus fibrosus ruptures dorsolaterally to laterally, fragments compress the ventral funiculi, lateral funiculi, and/or spinal nerve roots. Degeneration of intervertebral disks in nonchondrodystrophic breeds of dogs is an aging change of the nucleus pulposus resulting from fibrous metaplasia. This change causes a gradual loss of elasticity of the nucleus pulposus, which may be noticed clinically by 8 to 10 years of age. The gradual loss of elasticity places mechanical stress forces on the annulus fibrosus and results in its protrusion into and compression of the spinal canal (Hansen type II herniation).",

Necrotizing encephalitis, a second important idiopathic encephalitis of the dog, has two variants, necrotizing meningoencephalitis (NME) and necrotizing leukoencephalitis (NLE). Necrotizing meningoencephalitis is a disease that is almost always restricted to small breed dogs like the pug, shih tzu, and Maltese terrier. It was once referred to as pug-dog encephalitis before it was recognized in a wide variety of small breed dogs. Grossly, this disease appears as bilateral foci of malacia and discoloration of the cerebral hemispheres. Histologically, this gross lesion corresponds to regions of meningoencephalitis in which the inflammation is typically robust, nonsuppurative, and associated with marked gliosis. Unlike in cases of granulomatous meningoencephalitis, spinal cord involvement is uncommon. The second disease is known as necrotizing leukoencephalitis. This disease predominates in the white matter. It is most commonly seen in Yorkshire terriers, although sporadic reports exist in other small breed dogs. Gross lesions consist of prominent bilateral cavitation and necrosis of the cerebral white matter. Histologically, there is robust nonsuppurative inflammation accompanied by gliosis, cavitation, edema, and gitter cell infiltration. The etiopathogenesis of both diseases is unknown, and whether they represent a continuum of the same disease or distinct diseases is still debated. Populations of lymphocytes and macrophages as determined by experimental analysis are similar in the two variants. Clinical signs in both variants are typically nonspecific and can involve a variety of prosencephalic processes such as behavior, processing of sensory and associative information, and the initiation of voluntary movement.",

Although the anatomy of vertebrae and intervertebral disks is similar in dogs and human beings, there are notable differences in the anatomy of the spinal cord and spinal nerve roots that result in differences between the two species in clinical signs caused by herniated disks. Disk herniations in human beings commonly occur laterally, rather than dorsally as in dogs, contributing to the differences in clinical presentations (i.e., lateral herniations compress spinal nerve rootlets, whereas dorsal compression in dogs impinges on the spinal cord directly). In human beings the spinal cord terminates at the level of the second lumbar vertebra. Spinal nerve roots forming the cauda equina traverse the remaining lumbar and sacral vertebrae before they exit the spinal canal to innervate structures. In dogs the spinal cord terminates at the level of the sixth lumbar vertebra, and nerve roots forming the cauda equina traverse the remaining lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal vertebrae before they exit the spinal canal to innervate structures. Therefore in human beings, disk disease involving the caudal lumbar vertebrae (caudal to L2) results in compression of spinal nerve roots that innervate limbs and are reflected clinically in a condition known as sciatica that is defined as referred pain in the sciatic nerve. In dogs, herniated disks in the lumbar vertebra primarily compress the spinal cord and under certain circumstances spinal nerves. Dogs thus present clinically with different neurologic signs.",

Human beings, with bipedal locomotion and erect posture, dissipate the forces of walking (also running) by transferring these forces from the legs up the vertebral column to the lumbar vertebrae (i.e., first in line to absorb and dissipate forces). In addition, lumbar vertebrae are not stabilized by the rib cage, and thus lumbar vertebrae must also absorb rotational forces (i.e., twisting forces) of motion. Therefore lumbar vertebrae are the primary sites affected. A similar virus has recently been recognized in ferrets and can cause similar lesions in the CNS. There are two recognized feline coronaviruses: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which cause FECV and feline infectious peritonitis infections, respectively. The viruses for each infection are antigenically and morphologically indistinguishable and are currently considered to represent avirulent (FECV) and virulent (FIPV) strains of the same basic feline coronavirus. After ingestion, FECV infects and replicates in epithelial cells of the intestine and usually is an insignificant infection, although severe intestinal disease can occur. Recent research suggests that a mutation in the gene for the furin cleavage site of a spike protein (a structural glycoprotein) in the FECV viral envelope gives the virus the ability to mutate to FIPV and replicate in monocytes/ macrophages, use leukocyte trafficking (see Chapter 4) by these cells to spread systemically, and cause lesions characteristic of feline infectious peritonitis in other organ systems.",

The first involves the development of virusantibody-complement complexes that particularly accumulate in the same areas as infected macrophages around small blood vessels, resulting in inflammation and subsequent vascular injury (type III hypersensitivity) accompanied by effusion of large amounts of fluid. The second mechanism involves a process referred to as antibodydependent enhancement (demonstrated to occur experimentally), which involves uptake of virus-antibody-complement complexes by macrophages followed by significant viral replication.

In addition, there is evidence to support the theory that cats recovered from feline infectious peritonitis are immune by a process of \"infection immunity\" or \"premunition.\" Once these cats no longer retain such infections, they seem to also lose protective (cell-mediated) immunity and are in fact more sensitive to a subsequent challenge exposure because of the presence of humoral antibody.",

Cell death and axonal degeneration of the PNS are the end points of a chronic and progressive process of substrate accumulation that interferes with cellular biochemical Depending on species and anatomic location, endothelial cells of endoneurial blood vessels can be joined by tight junctions, preventing free passage of some macromolecules and providing an incomplete blood-nerve barrier. Collagen bundles and modified fibroblastic cells, termed perineurial cells, form the perineurium that ensheathes individual nerve fascicles. The perineurium contributes some barrier properties by preventing the free diffusion of macromolecules into the nerve fascicles. The fibrous epineurium is continuous with the dura mater as a peripheral nerve joins the CNS and encloses groups of nerve fascicles. The epineurium contains fibroblasts, mast cells, and adipocytes, the latter probably providing some protection to the nerve.

The initial toxic effects can be at the level of the neuron cell body, the axon, or the myelin sheaths. Examples of toxins targeting neuronal cell bodies are organomercurial compounds such as methylmercury and the cancer chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. Methylmercury is particularly toxic because it directly alters biochemical reactions. Although methylmercury poisoning can result from ingestion of water or forage contaminated with industrial discharge, in animals the consumption of fish containing excessive concentrations of methylmercury is the most likely source of the toxin. Fish accumulate methylmercury in their muscle as a result of a \"normal\" environmental process called biomethylation. Biomethylation converts elemental mercury to methylmercury, which is ingested in the diet of fish. In mercury poisoning, sensory neuron cell bodies of the dorsal root ganglion are preferentially involved, and the motor neurons are spared, whereas with doxorubicin, both dorsal root ganglion and autonomic cell bodies are affected. Experimental studies suggest that neuronal cell death is caused by apoptosis of neuronal cell bodies resulting in axonal and Wallerian degeneration.",

This interaction results in distortion of receptors and blocks binding of the receptors with acetylcholine. Acquired myasthenia gravis often occurs concurrently with thymic abnormalities such as thymoma and thymic hyperplasia.

Mild injury that leaves the axon intact (neurapraxia) can result in temporary conduction block, but total recovery of function is possible. More severe damage that destroys the axon but leaves the connective tissue framework intact (axonotmesis) results in Wallerian degeneration distal to the point of injury, but the potential for regeneration and reinnervation is good. Finally, severance of the nerve with destruction of the supporting framework (neurotmesis) results in Wallerian degeneration distal to the injury with the potential for regeneration but little chance of normal reinnervation. Destruction of the supporting framework results in fibrosis between the proximal and distal ends of the nerve and this gap may be large depending on the severity of the injury. Fibrous tissue can obstruct the regenerating proximal axon from reaching the distal supporting framework of the axon.

Involvement of dorsal spinal nerve rootlets and ganglia is not constant and relatively minor. Lesions in the ventral nerve rootlets consist of segmental demyelination with a variable influx of neutrophils, depending on the acuteness and severity of clinical signs, along with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages ( Fig.  14-116) . Axonal degeneration is a common sequela. Evidence of remyelination with B\u00fcngner's bands and axonal sprouting occur during the recovery phase, but the effectiveness of the latter to establish continuity of the nerve rootlet and thus reinnervation of muscle is limited.",

The possible causes of this axonopathy are multiple, and there may be different causes for different age groups of animals and different forms of the disease. Known causes include (1) transection of the axon by extension of inflammation from the guttural pouches because the nerve runs through the pouch within a connective tissue fold and (2) other trauma to the nerve. There is also some evidence that laryngeal paralysis may be inherited in younger horses. Currently a genetic age-onset abnormality of axoplasmic flow appears to be the most likely cause in horses in which trauma and inflammation can be excluded as causes.",

Laryngeal hemiplegia can affect the right or left dorsal cricoarytenoid muscles; however, 95% of cases involve the left side. The cause of this specificity is unclear. Some have suggested it is related to the long course of the left recurrent laryngeal, which extends down into the chest and loops under the arch of the aorta to return to the larynx, but this hypothesis is weakened by the fact that the axonal injury is distal to where the nerve innervates the larynx. Curiously, studies have shown that other long nerves in the horse can also show degenerative changes, which may indicate that this disorder is a polyneuropathy, rather than a specific disease of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.",

The Schwann cell's cytoplasm is distended by accumulations of actin filaments. Axonal degeneration occurs but is mild. Clinical signs in canine inherited hypertrophic polyneuropathy begin at 7 to 10 weeks of age. They include pelvic limb muscle weakness, depressed spinal reflexes, and muscle atrophy that later progress to involve forelimbs and eventually cause recumbency. Neuropathies with primary developmental demyelination have also been reported in Alaskan malamutes and in beagle-basset hound crosses. A hypertrophic polyneuropathy has rarely been reported in unrelated domestic cats with onset at approximately 1 year of age.",

SECTION II Pathology of Organ Systems enteric divisions consist of networks of afferent and efferent nerves and their ganglia (Meissner's [submucosal] and Auerbach's [myenteric] plexuses) that regulate, as examples, the contractility and relaxation of smooth muscle of the vascular and alimentary (peristalsis) systems and glandular secretions via sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. Afferent and efferent nerve fibers of the autonomic and enteric divisions are carried in the afferent and efferent branches of the sensorimotor division (cranial and spinal nerves).",

Primary cerebellar neuronal degeneration has been reported to occur in Merino and Charolais lambs, Holstein-Friesian calves, and Angus calves. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is suspected or documented in several of the diseases, but the mechanism of injury is unclear. Grossly, the cerebellum can be normal or reduced in size and atrophic. Microscopically, lesions may include loss of Purkinje cells, variable neuronal depletion in the granule layer, fusiform swellings of proximal Purkinje cell axons, and astrogliosis in the molecular layer.Animals with postnatal primary cerebellar neuronal degeneration are normal at birth or at the time of ambulation. Onset of ataxia with various other clinical signs referable to cerebellar disease begins weeks or months after a period of apparently normal development. Initial clinical signs are often subtle. Progression of the signs can be slow or rapid, relentless, or with static periods. Some individuals reach a stage without further progression of signs, but this is not typical of the syndrome in most animals.",

            "text": "Thiamine Deficiency in Ruminants. Thiamine deficiency in cattle, sheep, and less commonly, goats, has been termed polioencephalomalacia. Rumen microbes are able to synthesize thiamine, and therefore only very young ruminants, whose rumens have not yet been populated by thiamine-producing microbes, should be susceptible to thiamine deficiency. Hence conclusive evidence of an absolute thiamine deficiency as the sole cause of polioencephalomalacia in ruminants has been elusive. Evidence or theories linking thiamine with the ruminant disorder include the following: 1. Clinical response to thiamine injection in some individuals. 2. Decreases in ruminal thiamine or overgrowth of thiaminaseproducing microbes such as Bacillus thiaminolyticus. 3. Ingestion of thiaminase-containing plants such as bracken fern. 4. Production of inactive thiamine analogues. 5. Decreased absorption or increased fecal excretion of thiamine. 6. Sulfur toxicosis can result in identical lesions through the process of sulfite cleaving thiamine. Gross lesions, if present, are limited primarily to the cerebral cortex. Initially, 2 days after onset, the surface of the brain can be swollen (cerebral edema) as indicated by flattening of cerebrocortical gyri and narrow sulci. In rare cases with more severe brain swelling, brain displacement with herniation of the parahippocampal gyri beneath the tentorium cerebelli and the vermis of the cerebellum into the foramen magnum can occur. By 4 days after onset, yellow discoloration of the cerebrocortical gray matter occurs (Fig. 14-91) , and it is at this time that autofluorescence (see later for more detail) is seen when the brain is examined under 365-nm ultraviolet light (Fig. 14-92 ). Eight to 10 days after onset, edematous separation and necrosis involving the middle to deep lamina or gray matter-white matter interface may be appreciable (Fig. 14-93) . In advanced cases with prolonged survival, areas of marked atrophy of cerebral gyri agent. Countries that have reported cases of BSE or are considered to have a substantial risk to have animals with BSE include Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Yugoslavia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom (Great Britain, including Northern Ireland and the Falkland Islands). Since the number of affected animals peaked in the 1990s and early 2000s, the number of animals affected yearly has diminished to only small numbers (<6/year).In December 2003, BSE was confirmed in a single dairy cow from a herd in Washington State. This cow was apparently imported into the United States 2 to 3 years earlier from a farm in northern Alberta, Canada, which was the source of the positive BSE case in Canada confirmed in May 2003. In 2004, additional cases of BSE likely linked to a common source were reported in Washington State, Oregon, and Canada, and in June 2005 a cow tested positive for BSE in Texas.Signs that accompany BSE include changes in behavior such as nervousness or aggressiveness, abnormal posture, abnormal gait, incoordination, difficulty in rising, decreased milk production, and loss of body weight despite continued appetite. Clinically, affected cattle deteriorate until they either die or require euthanasia. This clinical period usually ranges from 2 weeks to 6 months. All cases of the disease in cattle have occurred in adult animals, with an age range of 3 to 11 years, but most animals have clinical signs develop between 3 and 5 years of age.The National Veterinary Services Laboratory (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS]) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has developed and implemented through local and regional veterinary diagnostic laboratories procedures for sampling, preparing, and submitting brains for BSE analysis. Space limitations prevent describing these procedures. They can be obtained through APHIS or a diagnostic laboratory. Dead or sick animals that display neurologic signs and are suspected of being potential BSE candidates are tested using immunohistochemical analysis, Western blot analysis, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to identify PrP Sc in brain tissue. Genetically valuable animals that may be exported or have their embryos or DNA saved for future use and are from transmissible spongiform encephalopathy risk groups can be tested for PrP Sc . Immunohistochemical analysis for PrP Sc of samples obtained (i.e., under anesthesia) from biopsies of tonsil, rectal lymphoid tissue, and lymphoid tissue of the third eyelid can be performed ante mortem.Ovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (Scrapie). Scrapie is best known as a degenerative disease that affects the CNS of sheep and was first recognized in Great Britain and other countries of western Europe more than 250 years ago. The disease, which is currently reported throughout the world except for Australia and New Zealand, also occurs naturally in the domestic goat. The name is derived from the characteristic clinical signs of pruritus, which often results in loss of wool in sheep. The disease progresses inexorably with early signs of subtle change in behavior or temperament followed by scratching and rubbing against fixed objects because of the pruritus. Additional signs include incoordination, weight loss (despite retention of appetite), biting of the feet and limbs, lip smacking, gait abnormalities, trembling (when suddenly stressed), recumbency, and eventually death after 1 to 6 months or longer.Much of our current understanding of the pathogenesis of the natural infection of scrapie in Suffolk sheep has been advanced by Dr. William Hadlow and coworkers. It should be noted that Dr.",
