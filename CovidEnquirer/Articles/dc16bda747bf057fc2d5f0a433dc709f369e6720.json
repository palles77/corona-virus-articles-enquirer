Programmed frameshifting is involved in the expression of many genes in a wide range of organisms, especially in viruses and bacteria. The mechanism of programmed frameshifting is not fully understood despite many studies, and there are few databases available for detailed information on programmed frameshifting. We have developed a database called FSDB (Frameshift Signal Database), which is a comprehensive compilation of experimentally known or computationally predicted data about programmed ribosomal frameshifting. FSDB provides a graphical view of frameshift signals and the genes using programmed frameshifting for their expression. It also allows the user himself/herself to find programmed frameshift sites in genomic sequences using a program called FSFinder (http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/fsfinder2). We believe FSDB will be a valuable resource for scientists studying programmed ribosomal frameshifting. FSDB is freely accessible at http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/fsdb/.",

It covers three kinds of recoding event: programmed frameshifting, readthrough, and bypassing. RECODE offers useful information such as gene name, cis-elements, transelements, product and references, but does not provide complete details of frameshifting. For example, it is not easy to figure out the overall structure of a frameshift signal from the textbased information of RECODE. The locations of the slippery sequences in several RECODE entries differ from those in Gen-Bank, causing confusion to users who want to locate a frameshift site in the sequence.",
