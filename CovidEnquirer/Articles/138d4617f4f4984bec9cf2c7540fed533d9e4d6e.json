Results from a multiplex molecular diagnostic test are sent directly to a cloud database. www.syndromictrends.com presents these data in near real-time. Trend preserves patient privacy by removing or obfuscating patient identifiers. We summarize the respiratory pathogen results, for 20 organisms from 344,000 patient samples acquired as standard of care testing over the last four years from 20 clinical 50 laboratories in the United States. The majority of pathogens show influenza-like seasonality, rhinovirus has fall and spring peaks and adenovirus and bacterial pathogens show constant detection over the year. Interestingly, the rate of pathogen co-detections, on average 7.7%, matches predictions based on the relative abundance of organisms present. 55 All rights reserved.

Thus, to achieve maximal utility, 90 infectious disease surveillance systems should move beyond syndrome-based reporting and be pathogen-specific and comprehensive, reporting on as many of the common pathogens for a particular syndrome as possible. Sensitive and specific automated molecular diagnostic systems that detect up to four different pathogens in a single sample have been available from in vitro diagnostic (IVD) manufacturers for some time [31] [32] [33] . However adoption of IVD platforms with 95 broad multiplexing capability has become widespread only in the last few years. Commercially available systems that can detect most of the known etiological agents for respiratory, gastrointestinal and other multi-pathogen syndromes [34] [35] [36] include the BioFire (Salt Lake City, UT) FilmArray \u00ae System [37] ; the GenMark (Carlsbad, CA) eSensor XT-8 \u00ae [38] and ePlex \u00ae [39] ; and the Luminex (Austin, TX) xTAG \u00ae [40] , nxTag \u00ae [41] and Verigene \u00ae systems [42] . 100 Multi-analyte diagnostic tests provide the raw data needed for real-time pathogen-specific surveillance but there remain a number of obstacles to sharing these results (reviewed in [43] ).",

The detection counts and pathogen detection rates derived from the Trend data set for each 225 organism in the FilmArray RP are shown in Figure 2 . Other views of these data, including The pathogens' seasonal variability measured by percent detection can be classified into at least three groups. Group 1: The majority of organisms follow the classical \"respiratory\" season 240 (October through March) and increase by more than 10-fold above their baseline detection rate ( Figure 2C ). These include the CoVs, Flu A, Flu B, hMPV, the PIVs, and RSV (PIV3 is a slight exception to this rule in that it peaks in the summer months, and has a winter peak that is only detected regionally (data not shown)). Within this group, all but five viruses demonstrate significant biennial fluctuations; Flu B, hMPV, OC43, and PIV3 and RSV experience relatively 245 consistent annual peaks. Group 2: HRV/EV is in a class by itself in that it is detected in a high percentage of tests over time, (minimum of 10% in winter) and experiences moderate peaks of two to three fold outside the respiratory season baseline, in the early fall and spring ( Figure 2D ).

The observed rates of co-detections should be influenced by the number of circulating pathogens detected by the FilmArray RP test at a particular site. Figure 5A shows the average number of unique organisms detected at each site in a given week (see Methods: Calculation of co-detection rates). This number fluctuates from a 295 summer low of four to a winter high of 11 pathogens. Figure 5B (grey bars) shows that the total rate of organism co-detections in the Trend dataset fluctuates annually with peak rates occurring in the winter months.

What is novel is that this data is generated automatically, on site, and in close to real-time compared to other surveillance systems. Greater than 98% of the test results are exported to the Trend database within 24 hours of being generated. As part of the de-identification protocol, sequential FilmArray RP tests of the same type are put into the same 330 time bin. This has the effect that test results are exported faster during periods of peak use such as during the peak of the respiratory season or during an outbreak. Trend should be instrumental at a local level to determine the start of respiratory season; many hospitals make significant changes to their operations based on this event however, at present, data collection to track the respiratory season is often slow and manual, or semi-automated at best. 335 The key to implementing (Figure 3) , supporting the validity and utility of the Trend data. 380 A second source of concern in the Trend data set is a consequence of removal of sample identification such that we cannot directly determine whether the sample was from a patient or was a non-clinical sample (verification test, QC or PT) and should be removed from further epidemiological analysis. We estimate that non-patient testing makes up approximately 1.8% of the total FilmArray RP tests. Automated detection algorithms remove 3.5% of the total RP tests, 385 including approximately half of the non-clinical samples. With the exception of the four positive tests, the clinical samples removed by filtering should be a random sampling of all patient tests.",

However, several studies suggest that coinfections are 420 associated with more severe disease ( [71] [72] [73] , see also discussion in [74] ). In such cases, information about multiple detections can provide infection control practitioners with data that can assist in bed management and in the assessment of risk for nosocomial infections in a patient population that has been segregated by the occurrence of a common pathogen. Such information can prevent the introduction of a new pathogen associated with cohorting patients during busy 425 respiratory seasons [75] [76] [77] .",

For this reason we followed the Expert Determination approach to manage data export. 570 The study took into consideration data that are available on participating clinical laboratory FilmArray Instruments, BioFire's own customer database, the proposed Trend database and publicly available data sources.

Trend successfully used the Expert Determination process as prescribed by the HIPAA guidelines (see Methods), which greatly simplified the data sharing agreement between BioFire Diagnostics and the clinical site and allowed health care providers to use Trend without risk of inadvertently disclosing PHI.The software architecture underlying the Trend system is both simple and secure: 1) no changes to the institutional firewall or LAN are needed; 2) the Trend database cannot reach back and 345 query the FilmArray computer due to the institutional firewall, which is set to outbound data only; 3) Trend software can only submit data to the cloud database and cannot query the database. Yet, despite this security, authorized users of the Trend database can mine the deidentified data to look for novel patterns in respiratory pathogen epidemiology.The goal of an epidemiological surveillance network is to infer which infectious diseases are circulating in the general population based on testing a sample of patients[67]. Different surveillance systems have different biases in their data, biases that perturb the ability to predict true population prevalence.While the removal of all PHI has great benefits in terms of implementation, it also has several shortcomings that complicate interpretation of the data.First, Trend cannot account for the variability in the diagnostic testing algorithms applied to the selection of samples to be tested by the FilmArray Instruments. During respiratory season, health care providers may prescreen patients with other diagnostic tests including rapid antigen or molecular assays for influenza and 360 RSV, and/or commercial and laboratory developed molecular tests for a mix of other respiratory pathogens. Depending upon the sensitivity of these upstream tests, 50-90% of influenza and RSV for the subset of the patients screened would be excluded from the Trend dataset if the front line test is positive. This testing protocol may skew the actual prevalence of not only influenza and RSV but all other individual respiratory pathogens and co-infections detected by the FilmArray.In some institutions, testing is reserved for hospitalized patients and others at risk for developing complications of respiratory tract infections including the very young, very old and immunocompromised patients, so Trend data may represent a less healthy patient population and not necessarily general community prevalence. Conversely there are sites that perform a significant number of tests for the outpatient setting. This may create variability among the",

First, it is closely linked to the sales of the FilmArray test and thus is proprietary data that BioFire does not share (Google took a similar position in regard to 470 releasing the search queries used by Google Flu Trends [14]). Second, TUR is driven by both the demand for testing and the growth in FilmArray product adoption and increasing acceptance and usage by health care providers. A useful step beyond TUR would be a normalized Test Utilization Rate that can adjust for the underlying growth of testing unrelated to the intensity and duration of the respiratory disease season. An increase in a normalized TUR metric may indicate 475 the prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses and the intensity of respiratory disease overall.",

The USThe HIPAA Privacy Rule[95] dictates that Covered Entities and, by extension, their BAs, may only disclose PHI with the patient's written authorization for the purposes of treatment, payment 545 or normal health care operations, and a small number of additional exemptions[96]. Trend software resolves HIPAA concerns by removing all PHI before the test results leave the Covered Entity. This makes it highly unlikely that BioFire, or a malicious intruder into the Trend database, could associate the FilmArray test results with a patient. Because PHI is not exported, BioFire is not a BA and a Data Use Agreement (DUA) between the laboratory and BioFire 550 addresses the export of FilmArray data to the Trend database.

However, the level of this testing is less than 1% of the total due to test cost and the fact that repeat testing should not be used for test-of-cure. For these645    reasons, the occurrence of patient duplicate testing would be rare and would not impact the overall Trend dataset. At present we cannot easily remove test results that are part of research protocols. Users at the Trend Pilot sites are instructed to add the Tag: \"No Trend\" to such tests (at present 0.03% of the Trend dataset) but due to the manual nature of the process we do not know how well this request is observed in practice.The FilmArray RP TUR metric is defined as the non-normalized number of RP patient test results generated each week on average across the Trend sites (computed as a centered three week moving average). To calculate the pathogen detection rate (as displayed inFigure 2Aand on the Trend website) we compute the rate for each organism at each institution as a centered 655 three week moving average. In order to adjust for the capacity differences between sites, a national aggregate is calculated as the unweighted average of individual site rates Only data from sites contributing more than 30 tests per week is included to avoid noise from small numbers of tests. Because the calculation of pathogen detection rate includes results from patients with multiple detections the detection rate for all organisms can, in theory, add up to greater than one.In practice this does not occur.The CDC FluView rate of Flu A and Flu B detections as well as the reported incidence of ILI are taken from the CDC website[101]. Only the CDC data from the HHS regions that contained Trend Pilot sites were used for calculating the rate of influenza detections(Table 3).Pathogen co-detections are defined as FilmArray tests in which two or three organisms are detected.

The five week moving average is used to reduce noise due to small numbers of samples within a week at some sites. More specifically the Circulating Pathogen Number is simply the count of the unique organisms 675 detected at a site during a one-week period.
