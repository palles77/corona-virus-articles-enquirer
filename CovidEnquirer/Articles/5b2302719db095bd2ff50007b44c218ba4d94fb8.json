Serological tests were positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (11.0%) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (13.4%). Only 1.1% was positive for Legionella pneumophila by urinary antigen test. Of the pneumococcal isolates, 56.1% were resistant to erythromycin and 52.6% were not susceptible to penicillin. Seventeen percent of CAP had mixed infection, especially S. pneumoniae with C. pneumoniae. The overall mortality rate was 7.3%, and nursing home residence, mechanical ventilation, malignancy, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory rate > 30/min and hyponatraemia were significant independent risk factors for mortality by multivariate analysis (P < 0.05). The current data provide relevant information about pathogen distribution and antimicrobial resistance of major pathogens of CAP as well as clinical outcomes of illness in Asian countries.",

Since CAP is a condition with significant mortality and morbidity, early and effective antimicrobial treatment has been a major focus in clinical practice [1] . Pathogen distribution and antimicrobial resistance in major pathogens in a local setting are very important to select appropriate antibiotics for the treatment of CAP. Major identifiable pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella spp. [1] [2] [3] . However, the distribution of aetiological pathogens of CAP may vary by country. Most of the data on pathogen distribution of CAP have been reported from western countries, whilst only a few data are available in the Asian region [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . The recent emergence of antimicrobial resistance in major respiratory pathogens, especially in S. pneumoniae, is another critical point for appropriate treatment of CAP. Previous data by the Asian Network for Surveillance of Resistant Pathogens (ANSORP) showed that Asian countries have very serious problems of increasing prevalence and level of antimicrobial resistance to penicillin and macrolides in pneumococcal isolates [7, 8] .",

These were kits for detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM class antibodies. The presence of IgM antibodies allowed the diagnosis of acute infection directly on the first serum sample. If the result of IgM was negative or equivocal, IgG was tested on the first serum (stored after IgM test) and on the second serum (second blood sampling after 8-15 days) samples. If the second titre of IgG increased more than twice compared with the first titre, acute infection was confirmed. To detect Legionella pneumophila in all enrolled patients, NOW \u00ae Legionella urinary antigen test (Binax Inc., Scarborough, ME) was used, which is an in vitro rapid immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine specimens from patients with symptoms of pneumonia.",

This ANSORP study highlights several characteristics of CAP in Asian countries: the high prevalence of S. pneumoniae as an aetiological pathogen; the relatively high prevalence of mixed infections by bacteria and atypical pathogens; antimicrobial practice for the treatment of CAP; clinical outcomes; and risk factors for mortality. Demographic characteristics of the patients in this study were similar with those in previous data from other regions [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Approximately 71% of all enrolled patients had at least one co-morbid condition, including bronchopulmonary disorder, cardiovascular disorder, malignancy and neurological disorder. There were no significant differences in the clinical presentations between CAP caused by typical bacterial pathogens and atypical pathogens (data not shown). In this study, aetiological pathogens were identified in 44.8% of cases based on microbiological or serological studies. The relatively low percentage of cases with identifiable aetiology might be due to prior antibiotic use before cultures and difficulties in obtaining adequate sputum specimen [3, 4] . Approximately 30% of cases had received antimicrobial therapy before enrolment in this study. Among identified aetiologies, S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen, as previously reported from other regions [4, 5] . In vitro resistance to penicillin, macrolides and other antimicrobial agents in pneumococcal isolates from this study was consistent with findings from previous ANSORP studies in Asian countries [7, 8] . In particular, a high prevalence of erythromycin resistance with a very high MIC level would preclude the use of macrolides as first-line agents for the treatment of CAP in many Asian countries.",

Approximately 25% of CAP cases in Asian countries were caused by these atypical pathogens. Interestingly, however, the incidence of CAP caused by Legionella spp. was extremely low (1.1%) in this study. Although the incidence of Legionella pneumonia was low in this study, it has been reported as one of the most common atypical pathogens of CAP around the world [3, 5] . Another important finding from this study was the relatively high incidence of mixed infections by typical bacteria and atypical pathogens. The significance and frequency of mixed infections in CAP, mainly mixed bacterial-viral infections, has been increasingly reported [5] . Although we did not evaluate the viral aetiology in this study, 17% of CAP cases were caused by multiple pathogens such as S. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae or S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae. This epidemiological finding is important in clinical practice because this type of mixed infection may result in treatment failure of monotherapy with \u2424-lactam agents. Tuberculosis (TB) was diagnosed in 13 patients, which showed the same clinical presentations as bacterial pneumoniae. TB should be considered the possible cause of CAP, especially in areas where TB is endemic [4, 10] .",
