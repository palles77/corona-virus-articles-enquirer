Fourteen putative open reading frames were identified, 12 of which were predicted to be expressed from a nested set of eight subgenomic mRNAs. The synthesis of these mRNAs in SARS-CoV-infected cells was confirmed experimentally. The 4382-and 7073 amino acid residue SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins are predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases (bringing the total number of SARS-CoV proteins to 28). A phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene, using a distantly related torovirus as an outgroup, demonstrated that, despite a number of unique features, SARS-CoV is most closely related to group 2 coronaviruses. Distant homologs of cellular RNA processing enzymes were identified in group 2 coronaviruses, with four of them being conserved in SARS-CoV. These newly recognized viral enzymes place the mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis in a completely new perspective. Furthermore, together with previously described viral enzymes, they will be important targets for the design of antiviral strategies aimed at controlling the further spread of SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses 6, 7 are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA (\u00fe RNA) viruses, with a single-stranded genome of between 27 kb and 31.5 kb, the largest among known RNA viruses. The genomes of coronaviruses and related viruses in the order Nidovirales 8, 9 are polycistronic and are expressed through a sophisticated combination of poorly understood regulatory mechanisms. 6, 7 Coronavirus genome expression starts with the translation of two large replicase ORFs (1a and 1b; Figure 1 ), whose coding capacity is about twice that of the average complete \u00fe RNA virus genome. Via a 2 1 ribosomal frameshift, 10 the ORF1a polyprotein (pp1a; . 4000 amino acid residues) can be extended with ORF1b-encoded sequences to yield a . 7000 amino acid residue pp1ab polyprotein. Replicase polyprotein processing is carried out by two or three ORF1a-encoded viral proteinases. 11 The processing products are a group of largely uncharacterized (putative) replicative enzymes, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an RNA helicase that is fused to a complex N-terminal Zn-finger, and a Zn-ribbon-containing papain-like proteinase. 12 -15 The replicase subunits are thought to assemble into a viral replication complex that is targeted to cytoplasmic membranes by various membrane-associated viral proteins. 16 -18 In addition to genome replication, the coronavirus replicase complex mediates the synthesis of an extensive nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs (transcription) to express all ORFs downstream of ORF1b, which encode a variety of structural and accessory proteins. 6 -9 The number and composition of these 3 0 -proximal ORFs vary greatly among coronaviruses, but they always include genes for the Figure 1 . Overview of the SARS-CoV genome organization and expression. Comparison of the genome organizations of SARS-CoV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). The replicase genes are depicted, with ORF1a, ORF1b, and ribosomal frameshift site indicated. Arrows represent sites in the corresponding replicase polyproteins that are cleaved by papain-like proteinases (orange) or the 3C-like cysteine proteinase (blue). Cleavage products are provisionally numbered nsp1-nsp16 (see also Table 1 ). In the 3 0 -terminal part of the genomes, homologous structural protein genes are indicated in matching colors. Close-ups of two regions with major differences are shown (and see the text). In the N-terminal half of replicase ORF1a, SARS-CoV lacks one of the PL pro domains (indicated in orange/green in BCoV) and contains a unique insertion (SUD). In the region with structural and accessory protein genes, the location of the body TRSs involved in subgenomic RNA synthesis are indicated with red boxes (see Figure 3 and Hofmann et al. 76 ). The bottom part of the Figure illustrates which parts of the genome are conserved in the genus Coronavirus and in the order Nidovirales (the ORF1a sequence of toroviruses, which largely remains to be sequenced, could not be included). Furthermore, it is indicated for which domains homologs have been identified in other RNA viruses and the cellular world. Enzymes for which structural data are available are shown in blue. SUD, SARS-CoV unique domain; PL pro , papainlike cysteine proteinase; 3CL pro , 3C-like cysteine proteinase; TM, transmembrane domain; ADRP, adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1 00 -phosphatase; ExoN, 3 0 -to-5 0 exonuclease; CL pro , chymotrypsin-like proteinase; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; HEL1, superfamily 1 helicase; XendoU, (homolog of) poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease; 2 0 -O-MT, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent ribose 2 0 -O-methyltransferase; CPD, cyclic phosphodiesterase. Domains Ac, X, and Y are described by Ziebuhr et al. 32 and Gorbalenya et al. 47 structural proteins S, M, E and N, which drive cytoplasmic virus assembly. The mechanisms underlying the synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs are poorly understood. To explain the composite structure of the sg mRNAs, which are both 5 0 and 3 0coterminal with the viral genome, several models have been put forward, 6, 9 of which the one postulating the discontinuous synthesis of negative-stranded sg templates for sg mRNA synthesis 19 has received wide support recently.",

This indicated that different regions of the coronavirus genome have indeed co-evolved and that intergroup recombination has not played a prominent role in coronavirus evolution. 23 However, the agreement between the two classifications is not perfect, as some coronaviruses are sufficiently different to not have antigenic cross-reactivity with the established groups, 24 but close enough to cluster with one of them (group 1) on the basis of sequence comparisons. 7 Consequently, these viruses were placed into (the expanded) group 1.

Recent phylogenetic analyses of different SARS-CoV proteins using unrooted trees consistently showed that SARS-CoV does not segregate into any of the three currently established coronavirus groups. 4, 5 These results were interpreted as support for the classification of SARS-CoV as the prototype of a novel, fourth group of coronaviruses. 4, 5 However, in our opinion, the evidence leading to this conclusion was inconclusive and alternative interpretations, with SARS-CoV being an outlier in one of the established groups, remained possible. This uncertainty can be resolved only through the reconstruction of coronavirus evolution from its origin using a rooted phylogenetic tree, which is most reliable when an outgroup is included in the analysis. The closest known outgroup for coronaviruses are the toroviruses, which form a separate genus in the same virus family. 8, 25 The ORF1b part of the replicase and the two virion proteins S and M are homologous in coronaviruses and toroviruses. 26 -28 Unfortunately however, the level of conservation of the S and M protein genes is so low that we consider only the phylogenetic analysis of replicase ORF1b to be truly informative.",

It should be noted, however, that the size of this genome segment (, 5500 nucleotides) approximates the combined size of the genes encoding the four virion-associated proteins S, M, E, and N. A fully resolved tree was obtained, with all branches supported in more than 960 out of 1000 bootstrap trials ( Figure 2 ). The topology of this tree suggests strongly that the SARS-CoV lineage was an early split-off from the group 2 branch, which occurred after the two bifurcations that gave rise to the three major coronavirus groups ( Figure 2 ). Accordingly, in two regions of the replicase ORF1a polyprotein, nsp1 and one of the nsp3 domains, which differentiate the three coronavirus groups, SARS-CoV contains orthologs of domains that are unique for group 2 coronaviruses (see Figure S1 of the Supplementary Material). The published unrooted trees for the virion proteins and 3CL pro are also compatible with this phylogeny, 4,5 although formally we cannot exclude the occurrence of recombination with other coronaviruses in very limited regions. In this respect, we would like to stress that the differences in the composition and arrangement of ORFs in the 3 0 -proximal region of the genome (downstream of ORF1b; see Figure 1 ) between SARS-CoV and established group 2 coronaviruses does not contradict the above results. Group 1 coronaviruses also differ in this region through the presence of unique socalled \"accessory non-structural protein genes\". 6, 7 Some of these genes have been found to be dispensable for virus reproduction in tissue culture and/or animals. 6, 7, 29 The fact that, apparently, they can be acquired or lost easily in the course of evolution indicates that these genes can not be considered reliable group markers.",

This observation implies that the three cleavages in the N-terminal half of pp1a must all be performed by the conserved PL2 pro , 36,47 a downstream-located paralog of PL1 pro . The ortholog of this proteinase appears to dominate over PL1 pro in HCoV-229E, 32 and is the only active PL pro in avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV). 32,37 Immediately upstream of PL2 pro , we identified a 375 amino acid residue \"orphan domain\" in SARS-CoV (called SUD for SARS-CoV unique domain; Figure 1 ), which is not present in other coronaviruses. The corresponding ORF1a region differs profoundly among group 1 coronaviruses. In one of these viruses (TGEV), and in the group 3 IBV, this region contains just a few amino acid residues, essentially fusing PL2 pro to the upstream X domain. In contrast, HCoV-229E and PEDV share a conserved domain in this position. Interestingly, nsp3 also was the main site of replicase differences between BCoV variants isolated from respiratory and intestinal samples from an animal that had died during an outbreak of fatal shipping pneumonia. 20 Due to the plausible 65 and was adjusted manually.

As recognized also by others, 4,5,34 the sequence 5 0 -ACGAAC-3 0 is absolutely conserved and can be considered the core of the SARS-CoV TRS. Based on the SARS-CoV sequence with the largest 5 0 -terminal segment (accession number AY278741 5 ), the SARS-CoV leader sequence is (at least) 72 nucleotides long, similar to e.g. that of BCoV, with which it has a 19, 39 Whereas genome replication relies on continuous minus strand synthesis (antigenome), subgenomic minus strands would be produced by attenuation of nascent strand synthesis at a body TRS (red bar), followed by translocation of the nascent strand to the leader TRS in the genomic template. Following base-pairing between the body TRS complement at the 3 0 end of the minus strand and the leader TRS, RNA synthesis would resume to complete the subgenomic minus strand that would then serve as template for the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs. striking 20 out of 21 nucleotides match immediately upstream of the leader TRS (5 0 -GAUCUCUU GUAGAUCUGUUC-3 0 ). On the basis of the location of putative body TRSs, the synthesis of nine mRNAs by SARS-CoV was expected: the genomic mRNA (RNA1) and eight subgenomic mRNAs with sizes of approximately 8.4, 4.6, 3.8, 3.5, 3.0, 2.6, 2.1 and 1.8 kb (including 5 0 leader and 3 0 poly(A)-tail). However, in the first published experimental analysis of the SARS-CoV-specific mRNAs generated in infected Vero cells, the synthesis of only five viral mRNAs could be confirmed. 5 To investigate SARS-CoV RNA synthesis in more detail, Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV isolates Frankfurt-1 3 and HKU-39849, 1 and intracellular RNA was analyzed by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes complementary to a part of the 5 0 leader sequence and a sequence just upstream of the 3 0 poly(A) tail. The coronavirus IBV, 41 which also replicates in Vero cells, was used as control and size marker. As illustrated in Figure 3 (B), the genomic RNA and all eight predicted subgenomic transcripts were detected with both SARS-CoV probes, confirming the fact that these RNAs contain both common 5 0 -terminal and common 3 0 -terminal sequences. Remarkably, a slight mobility shift was observed for RNAs 7 and larger of the Frankfurt-1 isolate. The subsequent sequence analysis of this virus revealed that this was due to a 45 nt in-frame deletion in ORF7b, 34 probably the first documented example of SARS-CoV genetic adaptation to cell culture conditions. The confirmation of leader-body fusion sites of the SARS-CoV subgenomic mRNAs will be published elsewhere. 34 Remarkably, up to four of the eight SARS-CoV subgenomic mRNAs (3, 7, 8, and 9) may be functionally bicistronic (Table 2) , as observed occasionally for other coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs. 6, 7 The replicase of coronaviruses includes a variety of putative RNA-processing enzymes",

The first two activities are not known in RNA viruses, and recombination commonly proceeds through the copy-choice mechanism with RdRp switching templates to produce chimeric nascent chains. 55 However, due to the extreme sizes of their giant genomes, coronaviruses may differ from other RNA viruses and share an unprecedented similarity with DNAbased life-forms in the mechanisms of genome biosynthesis and maintenance. If confirmed, these unusual properties would explain the preliminary reports on the resistance of SARS-CoV to ribavirin, a drug that was shown to force other RNA viruses into \"error catastrophe\". 56 The experimental verification of these predictions will be an important step in increasing our understanding of the functional roles these putative enzymes play in the Z. and A.E.G., unpublished results) .

When the five enzyme families listed ( Figure 4) above were analyzed as a single dataset, it became apparent that representatives of these families cooperate in two nuclear intron RNA processing pathways. These pathways are functionally antagonistic: intron excision aimed at the synthesis of mature tRNA 58 and the production of intronencoded box C/D small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) from its host pre-mRNA 59 (Figure 5(A) ). In the first pathway, XendoU initiates a cascade of poorly characterized endo-and exonuclease reactions that may involve ExoN, a homolog of the yeast Rrp6p exosome component, 60 ultimately leading to the production of mature U16 and U86 snoRNAs. Subsequently, these snoRNAs may be utilized in diverse rRNA processing events involving nucleotide methylation by fibrillarin, a 2 0 -O-MT, 61 and assisted by helicase(s). 59 Strikingly, the homologs of three cellular enzymes from this pathway, encoded in the replicases of all nidoviruses except for arteriviruses, are genetically clustered in a single protein block (nsp14 -nsp16) immediately downstream of the RNA-helicase (nsp13) (Figures 1 and 4) . Because of the proximity of these four domains to each other, their expression must be tightly coordinated at the level of 3CL pro proteolysis and by the upstream ORF1a/ORF1b ribosomal frameshift signal.",

It seems even more conceivable that they, alone or in concert with other enzymes like the RdRp or helicase, are involved directly in viral RNA synthesis, particularly in transcription, which, in an apparent parallel with snoRNAdriven processes, 59 is guided by conserved oligonucleotide base-pairing interactions (Figure 3(C) ). The viral enzymes, like their cellular counterparts, might be part of separate pathways or, alternatively, cooperate in a single pathway in which the XendoU, ExoN and 2 0 -O-MT homologs provide RNA specificity, and the CPD and ADRP homologs modulate the pace through processing of compound(s) containing 2 0 -phosphate groups. In this respect, we note that both the XendoU/ExoN/2 0 -O-MT and CPD/ADRP cellular pathways start with an endoribonuclease-mediated cleavage to produce molecule(s) with 2 0 -3 0 -cyclic phosphate termini ( Figure 5 ), indicating the structural basis for possible cooperation of the coronavirus homologs of these enzymes in a single pathway. The expected functional hierarchy of the five putative nidovirus enzymes ( Figure 5(A) ) is supported by their corresponding evolutionary conservation, with the XendoU homolog being absolutely conserved and the CPD homolog being least conserved among nidoviruses ( Figure 5(B) ).",

Our conclusion that SARS-CoV is distantly related to group 2 coronaviruses ( Figure 2 ) implies that viruses from this group, in particular the extensively studied mouse hepatitis virus and its derivatives lacking non-essential CPD-like and HE genes, may be the best available models for both in vitro and in vivo studies, in particular where the synthesis of viral macromolecules and the structure and function of the replication complex are involved. A detailed comparative characterization of the BCoV/HCoV-OC43 pair may provide invaluable insights into the processes of adaptation of a non-human coronavirus to a human host, which should be highly relevant to understanding the emergence of SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV genome ( Figure 1 ) lacks genes that are common in group 2 viruses, like PL1 pro and CPDlike and HE genes, but encodes a number of unique protein sequences, underlining the ability of coronaviruses to the gross evolution. The comparative studies presented here have tentatively identified both known and novel viral enzymes (Figures 1 and 5) , most of which may be involved in RNA processing and have homologs of which the tertiary structure has been solved ( Figure 1 ). Intriguing parallels have been drawn between these putative viral enzymes and characterized, but distant cellular homologs that will guide the functional dissection of the replicases of SARS-CoV and related viruses and may put the mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis in a completely new perspective. The newly described putative enzymes of SARS-CoV double the list of potential targets for the design of antiviral strategies aimed at controlling this emerging virus infection. 33, 34 Materials and Methods",

Also, sequences that were identified below the threshold during the last iteration were used to initiate reciprocal searches that might have resulted in new significant matches. This approach worked for all protein families described here, except for the identification of the relationship between the nidovirus ExoN family and cellular DEDD superfamily, which is known to be extremely diverse. 43 In this latter case, using the MAST program, 72 we found a strong match \u00f0p \u00bc 3 e 210 \u00de between the most conserved motif III of a DEDD protein and a conserved block of the ExoN family that facilitated the identification of the two other motifs in the nidovirus proteins having a non-typical intermotif spacing partially occupied by Zn-finger(s) (see the text and Figure 4 ). Furthermore, we observed an approximately 30 times selective increase of the global similarity between the ExoN family and DEDD proteins, after the coronavirus sequences were modified artificially by removing putative Zn-fingers that are not present in the DEDD proteins. In the HMMER-mediated searches of .10 6 sequences using this Zn-finger-deficient ExoN family as a query, numerous DEDD proteins were retrieved immediately after the nidovirus proteins, starting with E \u00bc 0:81: The relatively poor statistics of these hits were due to the failure by HMMER to align all three motifs.",

These protein families may be known also under other names. Cellular homologs, not necessarily including proteins involved in the discussed RNA processing pathways, are listed in the top segment of each alignment and nidovirus proteins in the bottom segment. In the CPD family, along with group 2 coronavirus representatives, proteins of two rotaviruses (double-stranded RNA viruses), which were identified in this study, are listed. In both segments, residues are highlighted independently: black for absolutely conserved residues and different shades of grey to indicate different levels of conservation; amino acid similarity groups used were: (i) D, E, N, Q; (ii) S, T; (iii) K, R; (iv) F, W, Y; and (v) I, L, M, V. Positions occupied by identical or similar residues in all proteins under comparison are indicated with an asterisk ( p ) and colon (:), respectively, in the inter-segment row. For the ExoN family, three motifs conserved in the DEDD superfamily and Zn-finger unique for the ExoN family are indicated.
