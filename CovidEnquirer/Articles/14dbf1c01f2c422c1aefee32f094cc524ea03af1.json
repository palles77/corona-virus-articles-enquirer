Drazen said, the SARS shows that when confronted by a common enemy, we can forget our differences and work together fruitfully. This was the most important lesson from SARS, let us hope that we can all benefit from it. 12 Recently, the COVID-19 infection occurred and spread in the mainland of China, but the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus severe and fatal cases for COVID-19 infection is currently still unknown that hampers realistic assessment of the virus's epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response, 5 furthermore, the recent publications on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics mainly came from Wuhan, 6 , 7 , 13 the information about the imported city is exceedingly rare. On the basis of this study, firstly we provided the proportion of severe versus common cases of the COVID-19 infection, which was approximately 1:4, the ratio of severe to mild, non-pneumonia and asymptomatic cases were 18%, 73%, 4% and 5% respectively, the changes and prognosis of those four categories should be future observed in hospitals. 13 asymptomatic cases were the close contacts who were found by medical observation in this study. If not insulated for medical observation, they would not seek health care or visit hospital and cannot be found in the special period, and will spread to the other close contacts. [15] [16] Therefore, to identify and control the non-pneumonia and asymptomatic cases are the important measures to prevent transmission on the COVID-19. The age of patients was from 6 months to 94-year-old, the majority of patients were young adults (77.4%), there was no significant difference between male and female in our study, population was generally susceptible. The patients were mainly residents of Beijing (73.3%), while the other patients mostly came from Wuhan(20.2%). But 89.1% of the residents of Beijing had been travel to Wuhan or contacted with the confirmed case in 14 days especially in the early stage of COVID-19 infection, after Feb. 1, the number of local confirmed cases began to exceed imported cases. In this study, 133 patients from more than 20 families were infected, same as Wuhan, the infection of COVID-19 in Beijing was of clustering onset too.

Among the top 10 provinces and cities with accumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 cases, the ranking of Beijing has fallen faster than other provinces. Therefore, Beijing was successful in preventing and controlling on the COVID-19 infection, it benefits from the correct leadership and experience of SARS in 2003. From the perspective of death of SARS, as of May 11, 2003 , the fatality of the SARS was 5.0%, while the COVID-19 was 2.4% in the whole national, there was no significant with the fatality between SARS and the COVID-19 infection in the early stage, but different in the later, the fatality rate of SARS was up to 10% at last. 17 This study has some limitations. First, only the COVID-19 confirmed cases transferred by EMS in Beijing were included, the first admission to the designated hospitals cases were not enrolled, nor other provinces or cities which dominated by imported. It would be better to cover as wide population as possible, to get more accurate results. Second, the observation time of this study is only 22 days, which is a bit short, and indicators such as discharge rate and fatality need further observation. Last, the official data of 2003 SARS is a month later than the outbreak, its epidemic development curve is not precise. However, this study represents characteristics of early stage of COVID-19 in Beijing, which has certain value for future control and research.",
