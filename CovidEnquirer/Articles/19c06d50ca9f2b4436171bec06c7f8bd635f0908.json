In the fourteenth century, the Black Death killed a quarter of the population of Europe. From the fifteenth to the eighteenth century, smallpox swept through the whole of Europe.

Many epidemics have taken place since the beginning of the twentieth century, including Spanish flu, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bird flu, and the Ebola outbreak currently raging in West Africa. The Ebola virus is especially deadly, given its high fatality rate and transmissibility.",

For example, Manchuria had been suffering wars and poverty, and the health infrastructure was inadequate, just like the West Africa of today. A further similarity is that the particularly devastating courses of these two epidemics have been attributed to the biological characteristics of the virus. It is more likely that these are the result of the combination of dysfunctional health systems, international indifference, high population mobility, local customs, densely populated capitals, and a lack of trust in the authorities following years of armed conflict.",

The pneumonic plague, which spread across Northeast China during the winter of 1910 and spring of 1911, caused numerous deaths and brought about severe social turmoil. After compulsory quarantine and other epidemic prevention measures were enforced by Dr Wu Lien-teh, the epidemic was brought to an end within 4 months. This article reviews the ways in which the plague was dealt with from a historical perspective, based on factors such as clinical manifestations, duration of illness, case fatality rate, degree of transmissibility, poverty, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and the region's recent strife-filled history. Similarities were sought between the pneumonic plague in Northeast China in the twentieth century and the Ebola virus outbreak that is currently ravaging Africa, and an effort made to summarize the ways in which specific measures were applied successfully to fight the earlier epidemic. Our efforts highlight valuable experiences that are of potential benefit in helping to fight the current rampant Ebola epidemic in West Africa. were infected with the disease exhibited symptoms such as coughing with blood-streaked sputum and a purplish skin discoloration; death followed within a few days. The first victims of the pneumonic plague were marmot trappers and fur traders in Manzhouli, along the Siberian border. The plague spread rapidly, especially in the Harbin area; in two provinces -Jilin and Heilongjiang -a total of 39 679 people died, accounting for 1.7% of the population of the two provinces. 1 At that time, Japan and Russia were on the ground, controlling the plague epidemic, and were attempting to infringe upon the territorial sovereignty of Northeast China. In this complex situation, the Chinese government instructed Wu Lien-teh to head for the plague-affected areas. By strengthening railway quarantine, controlling traffic, isolating the epicenter of the plague, cremating victims' bodies, and many other measures, and by facilitating collaboration between the Chinese and foreign governments and doctors, Wu Lien-teh finally quelled the pneumonic plague. It was the largest infectious disease to spread through China in the twentieth century, occurring over less than 4 months. This was the first ever recorded cooperation between scientific prevention experts and government bodies to effectively control a large plague in China.",

Considering their situation, they should be praised; the people had learned a terrible lesson and profoundly believed that these methods could save their lives. As such, it is necessary to learn from past populations, from which we can find the commonalities and understand the implications to deal with the crises of today. 6 A comparison of the background environment between the pneumonic plague in Northeast China and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is given in Table 1 .",

Systematically exploring history shows not only respect for traditional culture, but is also an important way to explore the direction of development for the future. Using a variety of measures, applied appropriately, the Northeast China pneumonic plague epidemic, which resulted in as many as 60 000 deaths and shocked the world in the early twentieth century, was successfully halted in less than 4 months. In April 1911, an article published in China's most important church publication, 'Senate Magazine' (The Chinese Recorder), also stated that the Chinese people should be commended for using the Western way to combat the plague for the first time. [7] [8] [9] It can be seen that on the frontline of fighting disease, there is no absolute authority. Combining the essence of Western medicine with the prevailing situation and people's awareness, and putting scientific ideas into practice, is ultimately the key to victory in the battle to prevent epidemics. Wu's study experience brought an outsider's perspective, free from the tradition of China's medical practices. Breaking cultural boundaries, in spite of prejudice and the questioning of foreign experts, and using his solid medical knowledge and clinical experience, he won the battle. His methods have become standard in the control of highly infectious diseases, and some of the measures in his response to the plague are highly indicated for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.",

This is particularly the case in countries like those in West Africa, in which governments that are relatively weak cannot rely on their own actions alone to win the battle against the Ebola epidemic. The world needs strong World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) governance to provide technical leadership and operational support to governments and partners in Ebola control efforts. 14 The Ebola crisis delivers a powerful message regarding the consequences of the weakening of the WHO, once the leading organization in public health policy-making. 15 Today, the WHO is increasingly weak technically, politically, and financially. Failures in leadership have allowed a preventable disease to spin out of control, with extensive harm to social order and human dignity. Ebola has reached the point where it could become established as an endemic infection because of a highly inadequate and late global response. Not only did it take more than 3 months to diagnose Ebola as the cause of the epidemic-in contrast to the recent outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it took a matter of days-but it was not until 5 months and 1000 deaths later that a public health emergency was declared, and it was nearly another 2 months before a humanitarian response was put into action. 16 The global community should take responsibility for strengthening skilled manpower and infrastructure capacity in low-resource countries to effectively prevent and control diseases and make the world a safer place. Major failures in governance and leadership could be rectified if lessons are learned from Ebola. 17 ",

People would flee the area by way of bribes because of food shortages or psychological isolation. As the virus has spread unchecked across West Africa, other untraceable emigrants may carry it inside their bodies as they cross borders. Therefore, the WHO recommends that ''response activities must be adapted in areas of very intense transmission and particular attention must be given to stopping transmission in capital cities, thereby facilitating the larger response and relief effort. If non-essential movement in and out of a containment area is stopped, ensure that essential movement (e.g. for response providers, essential services) continues unhindered. To facilitate Ebola virus disease (EVD) response, defer mass gatherings until intensity of transmission is reduced.'' 21",

On October 26, the first victims of the plague were discovered at Manchuria station. A total distance of 530 miles east of the Dongqing and Zhongdong railroads became the major thoroughfare to Harbin from Manchuria. As a result of social progress, foreign exchange had increased and the opportunity for interactions between countries and regions was also increasing. However, this also increased the possibility of the spread of the epidemic between regions and countries. Therefore, the establishment and implementation of the prevention of infectious diseases was crucial. Medical staff from cosmopolitan centers were selected to conduct quarantine inspections along the main routes of transmission of the epidemic -railway and steamship routesand to set up a temporary hospital at the station, if necessary, cutting off outbound traffic from the infected area. The development and implementation of this quarantine system was in part to avoid the spread of disease among regions, but also to avoid the spread between countries. [22] [23] [24] Today, the situation is far from comparable to that with regard to the historical travel/transport system. However, the spread of disease may also have been helped by urbanization and development, which have strengthened transport links resulting in the virus being shuttled from villages to the town and back into uninfected areas. Nevertheless, the WHO has not called for a ban on travel, instead recommending that travelers leaving affected countries be screened on departure for fever and anyone suspected of carrying the virus. A comprehensive travel ban would cause economic hardship, but the situation regarding migrant workers from countries with an increasingly uncontrollable epidemic will increase the risk of the international spread of Ebola. 25 Thus, in today's situation of economic globalization, although we cannot completely restrict traffic (as in historical times), we are able to support the strict implementation of precautionary measures, providing the necessary medical treatment for the crew and passengers involved in air travel and those handling cargo shipped to and from affected areas, and imposing strict quarantine for disease prevention and control; we are also able to reduce the isolation and economic hardship suffered by affected countries.",

Mass cremation was the solution, but the Chinese viewed this as an act of desecration. 26 To overcome this problem, Wu invited local officials to visit the burial ground and explained to them the health dangers. He then sent a memorandum to the Emperor. After three anxious days, the Imperial Edict allowing cremation arrived. On January 31, 1911, the Chinese Lunar New Year, the first mass cremation in Chinese history began. Bodies that had previously been buried were also dug up and cremated.

In the face of an epidemic and possible death, we must resolutely abandon the shackles of outdated viral prevention systems to avoid the spread of viruses facilitated by the presence of corpses.
