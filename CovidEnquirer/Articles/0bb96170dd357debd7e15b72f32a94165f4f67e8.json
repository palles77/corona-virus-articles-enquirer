Infected pigs developed fever, reduced appetite, respiratory distress and dullness at 9 days post-inoculation (dpi). Non-invasive pulmonary function tests using impulse oscillometry and rebreathing of test gases (He, CO) revealed peripheral airway obstruction, reduced lung compliance and reduced lung CO-transfer factor. PRRSV-induced pulmonary dysfunction was most marked at 9-18 dpi and was accompanied by a significantly increased respiratory rate and decreased tidal volume. Expiration was affected more than inspiration. On histopathological examination, multifocal areas of interstitial pneumonia (more severe and extensive at 10 dpi than 21 dpi) were identified as a possible structural basis for reduced lung compliance and gas exchange disturbances.",

Rrs at 3 and 5 Hz measured during expiration was significantly elevated in comparison with controls, leading to a significantly larger difference between inspiratory and expiratory resistance values. This increase in Rrs,ex was statistically significant on days 12 and 18 after challenge for both Rrs,ex 3Hz and Rrs,ex 5Hz , as well as for Rrs,ex 3Hz alone on days 4 and 9 post-challenge (Supplementary Table 1 ). In contrast, Rrs at 3 and 5 Hz measured during inspiration was not significantly different between groups (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 1 ). Both Rrs,ex and Rrs,in assessed at 10 and 15 Hz were lower in pigs exposed to PRRSV compared to controls (Supplementary Table 1 ). Due to significantly increased expiratory resistance data at low frequencies (3 and 5 Hz) and significantly lower Rrs,ex data at 15 Hz, the resistance curves during expiration became inversely frequency dependent after PRRSV challenge, i.e. resistance decreased with increasing frequency (Fig. 4) .",

Microscopic lung lesions were more severe at 10 dpi than at 21 dpi which is in accordance with Opriessnig et al. (2002) . Some authors have reported coughing as a clinical sign of PRRS (Done et al., 1996; Beyer et al., 2000) , whereas others have attributed coughing to secondary infections (e.g. M. hyopneumoniae, B. bronchiseptica, PCV-2) (Thacker et al., 1999; Brockmeier et al., 2000; Thacker and Thanawongnuwech, 2002) . We observed a spontaneous dry cough in most of the pigs exposed to PRRSV, but not in controls. Due to the absence of other major respiratory pathogens in the present study and because there was no evidence of tracheitis, bronchiolitis or airway mucus on pathological examination, we interpret the observed cough as being induced by bronchospasms as a component of the respiratory illness caused by PRRSV. This interpretation is supported by the presence of peripheral airway obstruction, as evaluated by pulmonary function testing.",

Findings with respect to central and/or upper airways are reflected by both Rrs at 10-15 Hz and R prox . After PRRSV challenge, proximal airway resistance in exposed pigs was significantly lower compared to controls. This phenomenon might be interpreted as 'upper airway opening', an attempt to compensate for peripheral airway obstruction by increasing the diameters of upper airways (nasal cavities, larynx and pharynx). Due to the functional character of this phenomenon, no morphological equivalent is visible at postmortem examination.

Limiting oxygen diffusion from the alveoli to the blood can be explained by increased diffusion distance due to infiltration of alveolar walls by mononuclear cells. In addition, hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the alveolar epithelial cells, as well as the presence of alveolar exudates, decreases the amount of gas within alveoli. Alveolar hypoventilation due to a rapid and superficial pattern of breathing may also contribute to decreased oxygen exchange. In the pig, which has no collateral airways (McLaughlin et al., 1961) , each airway obstruction results in regional heterogeneity of alveolar ventilation (Robinson, 1982) . Consequently, obstruction of ventilation in pigs exposed to PRRSV most likely resulted in imbalances between ventilation and perfusion, leading to reduced oxygen transfer from the lungs into the blood. This would result in respiratory acidosis characterised by reduced pH and increased partial CO 2 pressure in venous blood, indicating reduced alveolar ventilation.",
