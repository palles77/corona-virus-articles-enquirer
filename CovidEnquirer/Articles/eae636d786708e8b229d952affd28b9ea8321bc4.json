Plasma can been used to supplement immunoglobulins in healthy or sick calves. Serum half-life of colostral derived immuglobulin G (IgG) is estimated to be 20 days. Half-life of IgG is important in determining response to antigens and timing of vaccination in calves. To date studies evaluating half-life of colostrum replacer or plasma derived IgG are lacking. The objectives of this study were to compare the serum halflife of IgG derived from colostrum, colostrum replacer and plasma in dairy calves reared up to 35 days of age. Thirty Jersey calves were randomly assigned to receive colostrum or colostrum replacer by oroesophageal tubing or plasma by intravenous administration. Serum samples were collected at 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days. Serum IgG concentrations were determined by radial immunodiffusion. The results indicated that half-life for IgG in colostrum fed (28.5 days) or plasma transfused calves (27.3 days) was longer than colostrum replacer fed calves (19.1 days). Further studies are required to evaluate pathogen specific immunoglobulins in order to recommend vaccination timing in calves fed colostrum replacers.",

Consequently calves are born hypogammaglobulinemic, thus making it essential for calves to ingest and absorb colostral immunoglobulins to acquire passive immunity. Half of all neonatal mortality can be directly attributed to failure to acquire passive immunity at birth (Tyler et al., 1999) . Acquiring of passive immunity through ingestion and absorption of colostral immunoglobulins at birth in calves can be achieved by feeding colostrum or colostrum replacers. Colostrum replacers are used on dairy farms when sufficient colostrum is not available or to prevent transmission of diseases that can be transmitted through unpasteurized colostrum (Foster et al., 2006) . In veterinary clinical settings, plasma has been used to supplement immunoglobulins in clinically healthy or sick neonatal calves with or without adequate ingestion of colostral immunoglobulins (Selim et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "Colostral derived immunoglobulins can suppress neonatal immunity by various mechanisms (Banks, 1982) . Previous studies demonstrated that colostrum deprived calves produced IgG and IgA earlier than colostrum fed calves (Husband and Lascelles, 1975) . The mechanism of suppression of the immune system by the colostralderived immunoglobulins can be either antigen specific or non-antigen specific (Banks, 1982) . As a result of this immune system suppression, concentrations of colostral derived maternal immunoglobulins must be reduced to a critical low level that does not interfere with response to antigen exposure or vaccination (Pastoret, 2007) . The rate at which this critical low level of immunoglobulins is achieved is dependent on the immunoglobulin concentration and immunoglobulin class absorbed at birth because each class of immunoglobulin is catabolized at a different rate. The half-life of each immunoglobulin can be used to estimate the rate of its catabolism. The serum half-life of colostral-derived immuglobulin G (IgG), M (IgM), and A (IgA) in calves was 20, 4.8, and 2.8 days, respectively (Banks, 1982) . In cattle, the predominant colostral immunoglobulin (85-90%) is IgG while IgM and IgA constitute approximately 7% and 3% respectively (Larson et al., 1979) .",

The objective of this study was to compare the serum half-life of IgG derived from colostrum, colostrum replacer and plasma in dairy calves reared up to 35 days of age. The results of the study were intended to evaluate if different timing of vaccination should be considered when vaccinating colostrum fed calves as opposed to colostrum replacer fed dairy calves or plasma transfused calves.

Calves in the plasma (PL) group were administered with bovine plasma at 30 ml/kg (Barrington and Parish, 2009 ) through an intravenous catheter (Becton and Dickinson Co, Franklin Lakes, NJ) aseptically placed in the external jugular vein. Infusion of plasma was performed slowly (10 ml/kg/h) over the first 20 min. Monitoring for transfusion reactions included monitoring heart rate, respiratory rate, color of mucous membranes, and abnormal behavior. In the absence of an immediate transfusion reaction, the remainder of the plasma was transfused over 20-30 min. In the presence of a plasma transfusion reaction, transfusion was discontinued for 10 min and resumed at 5 ml/kg/h.

The plates were incubated at room temperature (20-24 \u2022 C) for 24 h. The diameters of the zones of precipitation were measured using a digital RID plate reader (The Binding Site Inc, San Diego, CA) after 24 h. Serum or colostral sample IgG concentrations were determined by comparing the diameter of the zones of precipitation with a standard curve generated by the reference serum. The regression equation generated in this manner (r 2 = 0.97-0.99) accurately predicts inoculum IgG concentration. Minimum detectable serum IgG concentration was 196 mg/dL using the RID.

All calves had a serum IgG concentration of <196 mg/dL prior to feeding colostrum or colostrum replacer or administration of plasma. Mean colostral IgG concentration fed to the CL group was 66.1 g/L. Mean plasma volume and mean plasma IgG concentrations administered to the calves in the PL group were 753 ml and 2848.4 mg/dL, respectively. None of the calves in the PL group showed immediate transfusion reactions. All calves in the CL and CR group had adequate transfer of immunity (serum IgG concentrations >1000 mg/dL at 2 days of age). Median (interquartile range) serum IgG concentrations at 2 days of age for calves in the CL, CR and PL groups were 2377.5 (421.9), 2306 (475.2), and 669.3 (267.8), respectively. Only 1 calf in the PL group had serum IgG concentrations >1000 mg/dL. There was no difference in median serum IgG concentrations at 2 days between calves in the CL and CR groups (P = 0.565). Median serum IgG concentrations of calves in the PL group were lower than calves in both CL (P < 0.001) and CR (P < 0.001) groups. Using Eq.

Morbidity events were recorded in 21 calves (70% with 20 diarrhea cases and 1 pneumonia case). Fourteen of the 21 morbidity cases in the calves required treatment with antibiotics and or oral rehydration electrolyte solutions. Six calves died during the 5-week period. Of the calves that died or were euthanized, 4 calves were from the PL group, 1 from the CL group and 1 from the CR group. Mortality in the 6 calves occurred during the first 12 days of life. Causes of mortality in the 6 calves included enteritis secondary to enterotoxigenic E. coli, rotavirus and Cryptosporidium in 4 calves, enterocolitis due to Clostridium perfringens in 1 calf and enterocolitis due to E. coli, rotavirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in 1 calf. Given that 1 calf tested positive for BVDV on necropsy, all remaining calves (24 calves) calves were tested for BVDV by immunohistochemistry on ear notch skin biopsy. All remaining calves tested negative for BVDV. Proportions of calves with failure of Birth weight was reported as mean \u00b1 SD. Mean colostrum IgG fed to the CR group was reported as g/L and grams of IgG in the CR group. Mean IgG concentrations transfused to the PL group was reported as mg/dL. Median serum IgG concentration was reported as median (interquartile range). Half-life of IgG was reported as days (95% CI).",

The main finding in this study demonstrated that half-life of colostral derived IgG was longer than colostrum replacer derived IgG. Although these study results suggest different timing when vaccinating colostrum or colostrum replacer fed dairy calves, the current studies did not evaluate specific pathogen immunoglobulins to common vaccinations in adult dairy cows and pre-weaned dairy calves. The specific immunoglobulins for pathogens to be considered in future studies include rotavirus, coronavirus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhea, parainfluenza-3 and bovine respiratory syncytial viruses. While the specificity of the colostral-derived immunoglobulins is important to confer specific immunity, it should be noted that at birth calves have greater number of neutrophils compared to adult cattle (Rossi et al., 1979) . Primary and secondary lymphoid tissues of newborn calves are populated by immune cells and the circulatory B-lymphocytes can synthesize immunoglobulins following antigenic stimulation (Banks, 1982) . Thus passively acquired IgG are not the only immunoglobulins involved during conference of immune protection after birth; but cells from lymphoid tissues and neutrophils from circulation are also involved. Therefore lack of specificity does not necessarily result in occurrence of a morbidity event.",

Previous studies reported IgG half-life of 20 days (Banks, 1982) , 17.9 days (Besser et al., 1988) , 9.6 days for IgG1 (Butler, 1983 ) and 17.7 days for IgG2 (Butler, 1983) in calves. While the age of the calves during determination of half-life was not stated in two of the studies (Banks, 1982; Butler, 1983) , serum collection in calves was performed until 10 days of age in the third study (Besser et al., 1988) . We chose to determine serum IgG half-life in calves reared up to 35 days of age based on previous studies indicating that antibodies to different bacterial and viral antigens were not produced or did not appear in serum until 14-30 days of age (Kerr, 1956; Lambert et al., 1969; Thorsen et al., 1969; Husband and Lascelles, 1975) . Thus, it can be assumed that the majority of immunologlobulins in the serum are colostral derived in calves aged up to 30 days. The difference in the duration of follow-up is a potential explanation for the difference in the serum IgG half-life determinations in the different studies.",

One explanation for this observation is possible; increased catabolism due to complement activation by IgG aggregates from the preparation process of the plasma (Lundblad and Londeree, 1988) . In contrast, absorption of orally delivered IgG occurs within the first 24-36 h of birth is a non-selective passive process through pinocytosis (Stott et al., 1979) .
