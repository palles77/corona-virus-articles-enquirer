There is some difference in the reported symptomatology of SARS. The incidence of sore throat (6.1%) and rhinorrhea (3.7%) in our SARS patients is similar to that in Canada 14 but different from that of Hong Kong, where sore throat was reported to be present in 20% to 35% of cases and rhinorrhea was reported to be present in 22.5% to 26% of cases. 7, [15] [16] [17] The causes of the differences in the reported incidence of upper respiratory symptoms remained unclear but might be contributed to the different virus strains. 16 In this study, we validated the symptom score and the clinical score in a new cohort. The sensitivities of the score systems dropped from 100% to 96.3% and 92.6%, respectively. The specificity declined from 75.9% and 86.3% to 51.6% and 71.2%, respectively. Several factors might have contributed to the changes in the sensitivity and specificity. In a comparison of the adjusted ORs of individual items for both scores in different cohorts (Table 4) , the discriminating abilities of cough and diarrhea for predicting SARS decreased in the validation cohort. The proportion of patients with cough before or during fever, a strong negative predictor in the derivation cohort, increased in the SARS patients and decreased in the non-SARS patients in the validation cohort compared with the derivation cohort. The associated increase in false positive and false negative cases might explain the decrease in the sensitivities and specificities of cough for both scores. On the other hand, the frequency of diarrhea, a positive predictor in the derivation cohort, increased in the non-SARS patients of the validation cohort, which resulted in an increase in the false positive cases and a decrease in the specificities of diarrhea for both scores.",

First, in comparison with patients in the derivation cohort, the SARS patients in the validation cohort were older. More SARS patients contracted the virus in the hospital settings in the validation cohort, and they were older and had more underlying diseases. Many underlying diseases in the elderly, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, could increase the occurrence of cough before or during fever tool for a larger group of febrile patients, especially in settings in which laboratory tests are unavailable, such as an airport or a triage station. For example, in an ED triage station, patients with negative scores and therefore minimal risks of SARS could be separated immediately from patients at higher risk to reduce the disease transmission at the ED. Patients with positive symptom scores should be directed to further laboratory and radiographic studies and have their clinical score assigned. When a clinical score was applied after a symptom score was positive, the combined sensitivity reached 90.2% and the combined specificity reached 80.1%. With such high sensitivity and specificity, we suggest that only patients with positive symptom and clinical scores undergo isolation. Patients screened as negative by the 2 scores should be discharged to home quarantine and followed up by telephone interview until defervescence.

Because this validation study was undertaken at a busy ED during the outbreak of SARS in Taiwan, we did not have much time to modify our study and scoring system. If the study could be reconducted, we would follow the Speigelhalter-Knill-Jones approach or the logistic regression model to modify our scoring systems. 19 From the Department of Emergency Medicine (Su, Chiang, Ma, S-Y Chen, Hsu, Ko, Tsai, Fan, Shih, S-C Chen, W-J Chen) and Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine (Y-C Chen, Chang), National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.",

To further explore the clinical significance of the occurrence and timing of cough, the score for cough was modified to -1 (cough before fever), 0 (no cough), and +1 (cough after fever). With the modified scoring system in the validation cohort, the combined sensitivity reached 97.6% (95% CI 91.5% to 99.3%), but the combined specificity dropped to 46.2% (95% CI 38.5% to 54.0%). Other modifications of the scores yield similar results. The score systems in their current formats seem to be simple and balanced in terms of sensitivities and specificities. As the ROC curve demonstrated, selecting lower cutoff points for symptom and clinical scores will increase sensitivity by sacrificing specificity. With cutoff points of -1 and 0 for symptom and clinical scores, respectively, the combined sensitivity reaches 97.6% (95% CI 91.5% to 99.3%), but the combined specificity decreases to 44.2% (95% CI 36.7% to 52.1%). The selection of cutoff points and, therefore, the desired levels of sensitivities and specificities should be based on needs and resources. For example, in nonendemic areas with sufficient health care resource and isolation facilities, higher sensitivities may be desirable.",

Since July 5, 2003, when the WHO removed Taiwan from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS, the worldwide outbreak of SARS has come to an end. 13 Like many other comparatively new and poorly understood viruses, such as Ebola or Marburg, the SARS-coronavirus could periodically surface to cause outbreaks and then fade away into some animal or environmental reservoirs. 18 The scoring system we developed could provide an easy and reliable method for large-scale screening when SARS reappears.",
