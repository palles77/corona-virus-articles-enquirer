Here we show that fd virions in the absence of adjuvants are able to evoke a DTH reaction mediated by antigen specific CD8+ T cells. In addition, we analyzed the induction of CTL responses in mice depleted of CD4+ T cells, and we observed that short-term secondary CTL responses were induced in the absence of CD4+ T cells while induction of long-term memory CTLs required the presence of CD4+ T lymphocytes. These results examine the cellular mechanism at the basis of fd efficiency and provide new elements to further validate the use of fd particles for eliciting and monitoring antigen-specific CTLs.",

            "text": "The system of antigen delivery by bacteriophage is based on the modification of the phage display technology. The filamentous bacteriophage fd is well understood at both the structural and genetic levels [1] . The capsid contains one major protein pVIII largely alpha helical which forms a shingled tubular array surrounding the single-stranded viral DNA with its N-terminal regions exposed on the viral surface. Given the large number of pVIII proteins (approximately 2700 copies per virion), the peptides displayed on pVIII, even if expressed in a lower copy number on the phage particles, remain densely represented. There is good evidence from immunoassays and NMR spectroscopy that the exposed peptides adopt a stable three-dimensional structure closely resembling that which they exhibit in the wild-type parent proteins [2] . The unexpected observation that fd filamentous bacteriophage particles are taken up and processed by the major histocompatibility (MHC) class I pathway [3] and are able to trigger cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [4, 5] , suggested that fd virions represent an efficient system for antigen delivery. Here we investigate the use of fd virions that display an epitope recognized by CD8+ T cells to mediate a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, demonstrating the ability of fd bacteriophages to elicit DTH in the absence of adjuvants.",

Since it is known that coexpression of linked helper T cell and cytotoxic T cell epitopes on the surface of the same antigenpresenting cell (APC) is a requirement for priming a CTL response, initially we designed hybrid bacteriophages that simultaneously display helper and cytotoxic epitopes on the same virion. Using these double-display bacteriophage particles we showed that bacteriophage virions are able to elicit a sustained and antigen-specific CTL response both in vitro and in vivo [4, 5] . However, in further studies we also observed that single hybrid phages displaying a strong CTL epitope (OVA 257-264 ) were able to induce an efficient CTL response even in the absence of a T helper exogenous epitope [6] . We hypothesized that the carrier fd may also contain H-2 restricted CD4+ T helper epitopes and that these 2 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology latter may exert a sufficient helper function in C57BL/6 mice when strong CTL epitopes, such as OVA 257-264 , are displayed on fd bacteriophages. To better address this issue here we analyze the CTL induction by single-display fd virions in mice depleted of CD4+ T cells.",

In order to verify if the fd bacteriophages could be used as a vehicle to monitor the presence of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, we set up an experimental model to reproduce a prior exposure to the antigen. We sensitized C57BL/6 mice injecting them at the base of the tail, with a mixture of OVA 257-264 cytotoxic peptide, HBVc helper peptide, and incomplete Freund's adjuvant. In this model the development of DTH normally takes 10 days from the time of immunization. DTH reaction was generated injecting 10 mice with recombinant fdOVA 257-264 , 10 mice with wild type fd filamentous bacteriophages (fdwt), five mice with OVA 257-264 peptide, and five mice with soluble ovalbumin into the right footpad.

In contrast a DTH reaction was not observed in mice challenged with wild type phage, synthetic OVA 257-264 peptide or soluble ovalbumin. These results indicate that DTH reaction is triggered by fd virions displaying the OVA 257-264 epitope and that DTH is thus induced by OVA 257-264 -specific CD8+ T cells.

The groups challenged with the synthetic peptide or with soluble ovalbumin do not show significant swelling, meaning that these are not effective in eliciting the DTH reaction, while, as mentioned above, DTH was induced by administration of fdOVA 257-264 in the absence of adjuvant. Statistical analysis (Student's t-test) revealed that differences between DTH induced by fdOVA 257-264 with respect to DTH induced with other challenges were significant (P < .01, Figure 1(b) ). The use of synthetic OVA 257-264 peptide in the presence of fdwt did not elicit DTH (data not shown). This indicates that DTH was conferred by the antigenic determinant displayed on the phage surface and that induction of DTH by fdOVA 257-264 virions could not be ascribed to the presence of LPS contaminants in the phage preparations, since the same amount of LPS was present in fdOVA 257-264 and fdwt samples.",

We administered fdOVA 257-264 without adjuvant to mice depleted of CD4+ T lymphocytes by anti-CD4 antibody treatment [8] and then measured the secondary cytotoxic response. Specifically, we immunized groups of C57BL/6 mice according to the following protocol: (a) 50 \u03bcg fdOVA 257-264 ; (b) 50 \u03bcg fdOVA 257-264 plus anti-CD4; (c) 50 \u03bcg fdOVA 257-264 plus poly I:C. Untreated mice were used as control. Figure 2 summarizes the results obtained with all groups of mice. Figure 2(a) shows the percentage of specific lysis after subtraction of background lysis of unpulsed target, at the responder/target ratio 270 : 1, while Figure 2 (b) shows the ELISPOT assay to measure the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing splenocytes in response to in vitro stimulation with OVA 257-264 synthetic peptide. The results indicate that the filamentous bacteriophages administered without adjuvant are able to induce both relevant antigen-specific CTLs (mean 29.6% of lysis) and INF\u03b3 production (mean 124 Spot Forming Cells (SFC)/million cells) although these responses were lower than those obtained with fdOVA 257-264 administered in the presence of poly I:C adjuvant (37% lysis and 189 SFC/million cells). When we depleted the CD4+ T lymphocytes, the lytic activity and the IFN-\u03b3 production of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were lower (17% of lytic activity and 94 SFC INF\u03b3/million cells) than those obtained in the presence of CD4+ T cells, but these differences were not statistically significant (P > .05). The presence of CTLs in CD4+ T cell depleted mice indicates a secondary expansion, since a single administration of fdOVA 257-264 particles was not sufficient to induce CTL activity (data not shown).",

All available evidence indicates that bacteriophage administration is completely harmless to humans [10] [11] [12] .

Here we used fd virions only to challenge the DTH in mice sensitized by the administration of a combination of synthetic helper and CTL peptides. Thus we proved that fd bacteriophages are able to stimulate in the tissue the OVA 257-264 specific CD8+ T lymphocytes which were primed by a different delivery of the OVA 257-264 antigenic determinant. DTH reactions in the skin have been observed in many immunotherapy protocols and are often used as an indicator of antitumor immunity and virus vaccine efficacy [14, 15] . In addition, since DTH is relatively straightforward to perform, it may be employed as a preliminary screen for diagnostic virus infection and may serve as an in vivo measure of the lymphocytes trafficking to sites of infection [16] .",

Having assessed the in vivo cross-presentation of the OVA 257-264 epitope displayed on bacteriophages, our aim was to investigate the cellular mechanism that this carrier employs to stimulate CTL induction. The importance of specific CD4+ T cell help for CD8+ T cell mediated immunity is known; however interactions between cross presenting DC, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the establishment of immunological memory are still not well defined.

In fact, we determined that fd particles carrying the OVA 257-264 peptide Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology are still able to induce secondary expansion of OVA 257-264specific CTLs even in the absence of CD4+ T cells. It has been suggested that an alternatively CD4+ Th-independent pathway of CTLs activation may operate via recognition of molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) by DC [18] that in turn initiate signaling cascades activating the DC to provide T cell costimulation and cytokine release. In particular, it has been reported that small amount of IL-2 can be produced also by DC [19] , and the addition of exogenous IL-2 to mice depleted of CD4+ T cells restores the secondary expansion of CTL [17] . We plan to investigate in future work the ability of phages to function as PRR agonist, to induce cytokine production, maturation of DCs, and to upregulate their costimolatory molecules. This study reports that while the presence of CD4+ T cells is not essential to induce a secondary memory response, their presence is instead required to elicit a long-term memory response by fd antigen delivery. This finding should be 6 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology taken into consideration in designing fd particles for vaccine strategies.",

We show that the fd particles displaying a CTL epitope, and not the synthetic peptide, can be used without adjuvants to activate the antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the tissue, and to evoke a DTH reaction. This result suggests that fd bacteriophages can be used as a diagnostic tool to in vivo monitor both infections and the presence of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Moreover, since the fd system can be applied to vaccine formulation, we have defined the role of CD4+ T cells in the induction of long-term memory responses. We found that the presence of CD4+ T cells is required to sustain long-term induction of CTLs. In this context, in the fd system coactivation of CD4+ T cells can easily be achieved for all types of MHC-restricted antigens by constructing double hybrid bacteriophages displaying helper and CTL epitopes on the same virion.",

Ten days after sensitization, DTH was performed by injecting into the right footpad fdOVA 257-264 , fdwt, the synthetic OVA 257-264 peptide (pepOVA), or soluble ovalbumin. 10-48 hours later the area of swelling was measured using a caliper. (a) Curve response of all mice analyzed. (b) Values at 30 hours of mean thickness \u00b1 SD of the different mice groups challenged with the antigens indicated in the abscissa.
