Additional flights served new African air passenger markets and secondary airports in established markets. Overseas flights increased more slowly, serving a diminishing number of overseas countries and cities. In 1994 the Republic was linked directly by air with more overseas than African countries and cities; within a decade the pattern reversed. The changing geography of South Africa\u00d5s international air links reflects developments in the international airline industry, and South Africa\u00d5s increasingly prominent political and commercial role in Africa.",

            "text": "The reconfiguration of international and regional air routes has become a subject of concerted inquiry as globalisation proceeds. Analysts have focused on civil aviation confronting economic, trading, organisational and technological shifts in the last decade. Most attention has been given to examining the nature and impact of airline deregulation, privatisation, mergers and alliances (e.g. Debbage, 1994) . Recent research analyses the consequences for airline freight and passenger markets-and airport geography-in Europe (Graham, 1998; Thompson, 2002; Burghouwt and Hakfoort, 2002; Burghouwt et al., 2003) , Britain (Humphreys, 1999) , Spain (Costas-Centivany, 1999) , the United States (Vowles, 2000) , Australasia and India (Hooper, 1998; Kissling, 1998a,b) , Asia (Bowen, 2000 (Bowen, , 2004 Rimmer, 2000) , and the South Atlantic (Martin and Rom\u00e1n, 2003) . The passenger traffic implications of airline corporate strategies and of new global business interconnections have also been explored (O\u00d5Connor, 2003) . The research stresses the development of single and mul-tiple hub-and-spoke airline networks. Their particular alignment depends, among others, on the geography of the evolving space-economy and air traffic market, the aircraft used, the degree of airline competition, and the centrality, intermediacy and proximity of airports. The research raises the issue of corporate efficiency objectives complementing or compromising coherent national and regional aviation planning. It also raises the matter of linking aviation to regional integration and development strategies.",

Change has been slow in Africa\u00d5s comparatively small aviation sector. The reverberations have not been traced systematically, but country studies in Nigeria (Akpoghomeh, 1999) and Zimbabwe (Turton and Mutambirwa, 1996; Mutambirwa and Turton, 2000) indicate that despite protective policies, small, unrestructured African air services have been vulnerable to global and local (sometimes franchised) competition. The restructuring of African commodity chains as a result of globalisation will likely reinforce tendencies to regionalisation and hubbing. African air freight-carried largely in the holds of passenger aircraft-is predicted to concentrate at 0966 three key airport hubs (Pedersen, 2001) . Policy responses (such as legislative liberalisation and carrier rationalisation) need to be formulated to complement African multilateral aviation initiatives, and to capitalise on investment already sunk in aviation and airports. Not least, civil aviation must be used consciously to help attain sustainable national and regional development in Africa (Oxford Economic Forecasting, 2003) .",

Similarly, new air links would not be recorded precisely if they commenced mid-month, if the announcement of the start date was wrong, or if the notification was too late to meet the publication deadline. The focus here is more on origins and destinations than airlines, so it matters less that the published lists are slow to record any mid-month airline rationalisation, mergers or codesharing that does not disrupt the geography of flight links.",

Situated in Africa\u00d5s most prosperous metropolitan centre, the airport handled 12.7 million international and domestic passengers in 2003, and was the busiest on the continent (ranking 76th globally). Cape Town International Airport handled five million passengers that year, ranking third in Africa after Cairo, ahead of Algiers and Nairobi (World Airnews, September 2003). Recognising that Johannesburg\u00d5s airport has the best air links into the rest of Africa, in 2004 the United Nations Children\u00d5s Fund (Unicef) opened an emergency supply facility nearby.

During the decade South Africa positioned itself geo-politically and socially as an African country, with attendant \u00d4Africanisation\u00d5 in the geography of its scheduled, commercial air links. Sample weekly data indicate that in 1994 the country was linked to African and overseas countries by an equal number of flights. Ten years later the number of flights across South Afri-ca\u00d5s international borders had more than doubled. Most of the increase involved intra-continental as opposed to inter-continental flights. In the new century the Republic was linked by air with more African countries and cities than with overseas nations and airports, the reverse of the situation in 1994. There were more inter-continental flights to and from South Africa in 2003 than in 1994, but they served fewer overseas cities. The trebling in cross-border flights between the Republic and the rest of Africa was associated with landings and departures at more African airports in 2003 than in 1994. The number of weekly flights to Gaborone and Windhoek exceeded the number on the highest frequency long-haul route (Johannesburg-London) in both 1994 and 2003. In 1994 five overseas cities ranked among the ten cities linked with South Africa by the most weekly air services; in 2003 their number was only two.",

Albeit difficult to map, the most salient finding about the geographical realignment is the phenomenon of intercontinental concentration and continental diversification. This is not unlike in Europe. The degree and shape of the process at an intercontinental scale runs counter to reconstruction of the Republic\u00d5s international image, and to the country\u00d5s return to the fold of nations. But globalisation and consolidation in the global airline industry, and political events beyond Africa, shrank the number of carriers in the South African intercontinental air passenger market, and concentrated direct services into hub airports overseas. Paradoxically, in a postcolonial age, European colonial legacy-links remain the most robust and the most dominant.",

Rather, there were more frequent flights, and new connections with secondary airports, mostly in southern Africa. Outward investment in the continent by aviation interests in South Africa has complemented the \u00d4Africa-nisation\u00d5 process. The Republic\u00d5s aviation sector is far more influential in Africa than on the world stage. The national airline\u00d5s admission to the global Star Alliance group of airlines early in 2004 is likely to strengthen its continental superiority in service, organisation and financial muscle; scheduled for privatisation, the airline and its associated service providers have sub-continental and continental influence and ambitions. Yet it may be a simple geographical consideration that ultimately restricts the dominance of South African civil aviation to southern Africa: a peripheral location-not to say a terminal location-on the vast African continent is a substantial obstacle. The Republic\u00d5s eccentric, end-of-line position on the African and world air route map may reduce the demographic, trading and tourism advantages that would otherwise have justified the emergence of a more significant airline service hub in South Africa.",
