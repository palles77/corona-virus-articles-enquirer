During this time, the frontier of clinical chemistry in the mouse has advanced and expanded because of two major events: the increasing reliance on mice in biomedical research, and increasing availability of practical yet sophisticated techniques and instrumentations that have allowed for the detection of a wider variety of biomarkers of disease. The progression of these two events has been partially driven by the increasing regulatory demands related to safety/toxicity assessment of novel drug development.",

            "text": "For the last quarter century, mice have been the most frequently used mammal in biomedical research, rising from 61% of all mammals used in 1983 to 71% in 1993 (National Center for Research Resources 1997 . The nature of their use has changed dramatically during this time. During the first half of the 20th century, a great deal of emphasis was placed on the development of inbred strains. The availability of inbred strains has led to major breakthroughs in cancer, biology, and immunology (Quimby 2002) . By 1970 there were approximately 250 inbred strains available. In addition, outbred stocks continue to be utilized in a wide variety of studies but particularly in the fields of toxicology and pharmacology. During the second half of the 20th century, investigators developed congenic lines and recombinant inbred strains, each having an impact on elucidating the role of individual genes and assigning new traits to linkage groups respectively (Paigen 2003a ). However, beginning in the early 1980s scientists began to genetically engineer mice by either adding a new gene (transgenic) or deleting a normal mouse gene (knockout, KO) (Paigen 2003b) . The power of these models to elucidate the genetic basis of disease cannot be overemphasized. Over the past 15 years, publications citing transgenic and KO mice have increased exponentially and at the time of this writing the Mutant Mouse Resource of the Jackson Laboratory listed more than 10,000 such unique lines. During this same period the results of both the human and mouse genome projects were published (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium 2001; Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium 2002) . This provided complete nucleotide sequences for each genome allowing investigators to quickly develop the equivalent murine model for many of the inherited human diseases. Transgenic and KO mice have helped clarify disease pathogenesis in virtually every area of medicine and often elucidated biochemical pathways, previously unknown, which are now subject to testing and quantification. As a result, clinical chemistry in the mouse has grown from evaluation of 15-20 analytes found in plasma (or urine), to hundreds of biomarkers that can monitor disease status at the cellular level.",

For example, the development of surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) platform time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectroscopy (MS) allowed Petricoin et al. (2002a) to identify five peptides in the sera of women with ovarian cancer that were not found in women without ovarian cancer, even though the structure and function of some of these peptides were not actually known. Building on these findings, Zhang et al. (2004) combined the SELDI-TOF MS with protein separation procedures to develop a multianalyte immunoassay for rapidly screening potential cancer patients. This process of identifying proteins (biomarkers) that are predictive for a disease is known as plasma protein profiling. Similar technology has been used to develop plasma protein profiles for neoplastic conditions in humans, such as prostate cancer Petricoin et al. 2002b; Qu et al. 2002) and bladder cancer (Adam et al. 2001; Vlahou et al. 2001) , as well as a variety of non-neoplastic conditions, such as ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke , severe acute respiratory syndrome (Kang et al. 2005 ), Alzheimer's disease (Carrette et al. 2003) , and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (Sanchez et al. 2004) .",

They found upregulation of many peptides associated with tumor growth and metastasis, and many of these same peptides were modified during treatment. Two specific targets of acetazolamide antitumor activity were subsequently identified as histone H2B and CROCI (a UBC-like peptide). Park et al. (2004) used similar technology to determine plasma protein profiles for high (C57BL/6) and low (C3H) atherosclerosis prone strains of mice on normal or atherogenic diets. They identified 30 proteins in which the levels had changed after eating an atherogenic diet. Of these, 14 were differentially changed in C57BL/6 mice and an additional 16 were changed in both strains. In addition, 28 proteins were differentially expressed between the two strains regardless of diets. Four of these proteins were upregulated in C57BL/6 and 11 were upregulated in C3H. Nine of those protein markers were definitively identified and their roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis discussed in the \"Atherosclerosis\" section.",

More recently, Newell et al. (2004) presented data on predictive performance of rats and mice to demonstrate qualitative human toxicity when given 39 novel cancer chemotherapeutic agents. They claim that nonrodent species are unnecessary for identification of a safe Phase 1 starting dose for human trials. Furthermore, the two rodent species (rats and mice) used gave similar quantitative and qualitative results. The arrival of genetically engineered mice has further enhanced the relevance of using mice in research, especially in terms of basic mechanistic research and applied screening for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Transgenic mice carrying a human gene and expressing the protein are said to be \"humanized.\" These animals are invaluable in drug assessment especially when the drug interacts only with the human protein (Bolon 2004) . Zambrowicz and Sands (2003a) showed that the KO phenotype of mice correlated well with the molecular targets of the 100 best selling drugs available to the U.S. market. Zambrowicz et al. (2003b) compared the physiology of KO mice, where the deleted gene was known to produce a novel target for each of the 24 new drugs in the developmental pipeline of the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, and found that 85% of these targets demonstrated a sound biologic rationale for the selected disease.",

Historically, most analytes were measured by a colorimetric end point assay (based on the binding of an analyte to another molecule creating a new substance that absorbs light of a specific wavelength). Some of these analytes and the newer biomarkers are now measured by enzymatic tests that have higher specificities and sensitivities. Another change has been the substitution of electrochemical assays, such as ion-selective electrodes, for flame photometry used in the quantitation of sodium and potassium. Perhaps the change that has had the largest impact on clinical chemistry is the development of monoclonal antibodies and their use as reagents in immunoassays (to be discussed later). Many commercial companies now offer services that measure analytes and biomarkers in the blood of mice using a combination of colorimetric-, enzymatic-, electrochemical-, and immunologic-based methods, and many of the instruments used are capable of running multiple assay types simultaneously.",

Techniques employing nonisotopic labels for detection such as enzyme cascade, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and electrochemiluminescence, are rapidly replacing older radioimmunoassay (RIA) techniques. Enzyme immunoassays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), enzyme-multiplier immunoassay technique (EMIT), and cloned enzyme donor immunoassay (CEDIA), provide quantitative results based on photometric methods. Enzyme immunoassay is popular because it generates compounds that can be quantitated photometrically. Typical enzymatic labels include ~-galactosidase, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, and glucose-6-dehydrogenase. In addition these ELISA test kits are compact, easy to use, and quantitated with inexpensive instruments. These kits (usually in a well format) are available for quantitation of a wide range of mouse serum and plasma biomarkers (Table 6-3) .",

Four blood collection sites for acquiring 75 ~tl of blood repetitively from adult mice include the orbital plexus, the tail vein, the jugular vein, and cardiac puncture (Quimby 1999b) . General anesthesia is recommended for orbital plexus and cardiac puncture, although Terril- Robb et al. (1996) claim that topical application of proparacaine hydrochloride is an acceptable procedure for collecting orbital plexus blood. The jugular vein is punctured using a lancet directed at the rear of the jaw, exposing the jugular vein and its tributaries and the submandibular and facial veins (Golde et al. 2005) . Collection of blood from any of these veins at this site works well, and the animal does not require anesthesia or a restraint device. The blood should be collected with a small centrifuge tube or capillary tube. Nerenberg and Zedler (1975) describe a vacuum apparatus used to collect larger volumes of blood from the tail vein. Lewis et al. (1976) found that heparinization of mice before tail bleeding increases the yield. Prewarming the mouse under a lamp or through immersion in warm water facilitates tail bleeding. The use of heparinized microhematocrit tubes, during tail or orbital plexus bleeding can maximize the plasma volume with minimal hemolysis (Quimby 1999b) . Hem and Smith (1998) recommend a saphenous vein prick method over the orbital plexus method for collecting repeated small volumes from conscious mice. MacLeod and Shapiro (1988) used indwelling fight atrial catheters for repetitive bleeding of conscious, unstressed mice. Disadvantages of specific procedures have been described. Sakaki et al. (1961) reported sympathetic nervous system stimulation associated with tail bleeding and the mixing of venous and arterial blood with the orbital plexus method. Patrick et al. (1983) found that, compared to jugular vein collection, cardiac puncture was associated with higher plasma glucose concentrations and lower creatine kinase (CK) activity. Plasma glucose concentrations are higher in blood collected from the orbital sinus compared to the tail vein.",

Higher plasma glucose levels are reported with tail vein sampling in mice anesthetized with pentobarbital or methoxyflurane compared with conscious mice (Chuang and Luo 1997) . Plasma glucose levels are higher after collection from the orbital plexus if pentobarbital or proparacaine hydrochloride is administered. Methoxyflurane has no glucose elevating effect on samples collected from the orbital plexus. Cunliffe-Beamer (1983) claims that carbon dioxide narcosis provides sedation and analgesic for 1-2 minutes and is an appropriate anesthetic for orbital plexus bleeding.",

The total urinary bladder volume is less than 0.5 ml, and total urinary output per day is less than 2 ml (Jung et al. 2003) , meaning that mice frequently micturate. This restricts the amount urine that can be collected at any one time point and, therefore, will also restrict the number of analytes that can be assessed from any one urine sample. To be able to collect enough urine for assessment from a single live mouse, mice can be placed in a plastic cage without absorbent bedding material and urine then collected from the bottom of the cage after 4-6 h. However, a disadvantage of this technique is that the urine is exposed to the contamination by feces and other environmental contaminants and organisms. Pooled urine samples collected from a group of live mice using the same technique can increase the total amount of urine collected but will not allow specific results to be related back to specific individuals from that group. Mice removed quickly from their cage and held over a piece of parafilm will frequently void and the parafilm helps prevent the urine from spreading. Urine can also be collected directly from the urinary bladder from mice after euthanasia. This technique allows for a sterile sampling, but the volume that can be collected is restricted by total urinary bladder volume (0.5 ml). Often, the volume is much less because mice typically void urine from the urinary bladder at the time of death.",

The rate of entry is dependent on intestinal absorption of dietary sources of glucose, the breakdown of body glycogen stores (glycogenolysis), and synthesis from gluconeogenic metabolites (gluconeogenesis). The removal rate is mainly dependent on insulin, which is released from [3-cells of the pancreatic islets. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of blood glucose (mainly in muscle, liver, and fat) by stimulating the translocation of glucose transporters, GLUT-1 to GLUT-7 to the cell membrane. When removed from circulation, blood glucose may either be utilized (to maintain cell function) or converted to fat and glycogen in liver and muscle as an energy store. However, the effect of insulin is modulated by other hormones (such as glucagon, corticosterone, GH, epinephrine, somatostatin, and amylin) that ultimately result in the tight control the levels of blood glucose, depending on tissue demands for energy. Glucagon is released from t~-cells of the pancreatic islets in response to low circulating glucose, stimulating the liver to increase circulating glucose through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Corticosterone and GH antagonize the action of insulin. Epinephrine suppresses insulin release and stimulates glucagon release and glycogenolysis. Somatostatin suppresses both insulin and glucagon secretion, whereas amylin increases blood glucose, blood insulin, and insulin resistance (Burtis and Ashwood 2001; Kaneko 1999) .",

During times of high adipose storage blood levels of leptin are high and it promotes energy metabolism and inhibits food intake. The opposite occurs during starvation. But leptin is only one of a number of adipokines, secreted by adipose tissue, which aid in the regulating appetite and metabolism. In fact the location of the adipose tissue, the size of average adipocytes, and adipocyte metabolism of glucose and corticosteroids each modify the endocrine function of adipose tissue (Lazar 2005) . Among the proteins secreted by adipose tissue are adiponectin, adipsin, resistin, visfatin, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), angiotensinogen, SAA, and a-acid glycoprotein. Like adipocyte-derived free fatty acids, which have been shown to contribute to insulin resistance in liver and muscle, most of these proteins are capable of modulating glucose metabolism and insulin action.",

            "text": "Centrally the actions of both insulin and leptin take place in the mediobasal hypothalamus, where the neurons exert potent effects on food intake and energy expenditure. Here neurons co-express neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti-related peptide (AgRP), which stimulate food intake and reduce energy expenditure. Leptin and insulin inhibit these neurons. Under conditions of reduced leptin and insulin signaling, NPY increases, inducing hyperphagia, weight gain, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. The anabolic effects of AgRP arise from its antagonism of the melanocortin receptors MC3r and MC4r, which serve to limit food intake. Blockage of MC3r and MC4r leads to weight gain and insulin resistance. Precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus are stimulated by leptin and insulin and the resultant production of melanocortin and its binding to MC3r and MC4r inhibits food intake and promotes weight loss (Schwartz and Porte 2005) . However, in the absence of leptin, as seen in Lep ~176 mice, neurons of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are permanently disrupted and treatment in adulthood cannot reverse this defect (Bouret et al. 2004) . Orexin A (hypocretin-1) and orexin B (hypocretin-2) are neuropeptides produced in the lateral hypothalamus by neurons with axonal projections to many sites including those that control feeding behavior and sleep/wakefulness (Taylor and Samson 2003) . Orexin KO mice develop hypophagia with obesity and insulin-resistant diabetes (Hara et al. 2001 ). Ghrelin, a peptide made predominantly by the stomach, is also known to act centrally and affect food intake and increase secretion of GH (Ghigo et al. 2004; Korbonits et al. 2004 ). In the periphery leptin has been shown to specifically repress RNA levels and enzymatic activity of hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SLD-1), which catalyzes the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. This effect was found to be an important metabolic action of leptin (Cohen et al. 2002) . Leptin resistance, a common feature of obesity in mice and humans, has also been shown to result, in part, from the shedding of membrane-bound hepatic leptin receptors into the plasma, where soluble receptors modulate circulating leptin levels and possibly its biologic activity (Cohen et al. 2005) . Thus the connections between factors regulating obesity and insulin resistance (diabetes) are complex and occur both centrally and peripherally. Further investigations in mice will involve quantifying glucose, adipokines, insulin, leptin, soluble leptin receptor, and SLD-1. For further discussion of mouse models of obesity and diabetes please refer to Chapter 19 in this text.",

LDL, which is present in very low concentrations in normal mice, carries cholesterol to extrahepatic tissues. LDL contains Apoprotein B 100 and is the primary source of cholesterol deposited in the intima of arteries in mice. Apoprotein B 100 binds to the LDL receptor (LDLR). HDL is synthesized in the liver and contains large amounts of free cholesterol and apoproteins A, C, and E. During metabolism HDL free cholesterol is esterified by the action of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). The exchange of cholesterol ester for triglycerides (from VLDL) results in a less dense HDL subfraction that is completely removed from the circulation by the liver. Exchange of esterified cholesterol for triglycerides is mediated by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in humans; however, this activity is absent in mice. Phospholipid transfer from VLDL to HDL is mediated by phospholipids transfer protein (PLTP). High levels of soluble hepatic lipase are found in mouse plasma (Lusis, 2000; Wagner et al. 1999) . HDL is thought to transport cholesterol from peripheral tissue to liver by a process known as reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). This process is believed to be facilitated by the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which transports phospholipids and cholesterol to the acceptors apoprotein A-1 and apoprotein E (Aiello et al. 2002) .

In addition plaques contain a complex mix of collagen, proteoglycans, occasional cartilaginous tissue with calcification and lipoprotein (primarily LDL). Disease risk correlates directly with elevated circulating levels of LDL cholesterol and risk is indirectly correlated to levels of HDL. Thus, although LDL promotes atherosclerosis, HDL protects against it (National Cholesterol Education Program 1993).

Once LDL is within the intima there is an interaction between LDLapoprotein B and matrix proteoglycans resulting in LDL trapping. LDL undergoes modifications associated with oxidation, lipolysis, proteolysis, and aggregation that contribute to inflammation and uptake of LDL by tissue macrophages. Lipoxygenases (LOs) insert molecular oxygen into polyenoic fatty acids producing hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE). Endothelial cells release HETE into the vessel wall, where it initiates oxidation of LDL. Further oxidation of LDL is aided by myeloperoxidase and sphingomyelinase. Mice lacking LOs have diminished atherosclerosis. Macrophages and monocytes recognize oxidized LDL via their surface scavenger receptors and become loaded with cholesterol ester, forming a fatty streak appearing along the vessel wall. HDL, on the other hand, removes excess cholesterol from peripheral tissue and inhibits lipoprotein oxidation. HDL carries paraoxonase, which degrades oxidized phospholipids (Lusis 2000) and protects against subsequent oxidative damage. Oxidized LDL stimulates endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules (such as ICAM, VLA-4, and VCAM) and monocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) on their luminal surface, which attracts additional monocytes and lymphocytes. Oxidized LDL also inhibits nitric oxide production. Infiltrating thymic-derived lymphocytes (T cells) and macrophages initiate migration of smooth muscle cells from the media to the intima, where they synthesize matrix components. MCP-1 is also released by macrophages, inducing monocyte differentiation, migration, and scavenger receptor expression.",

The non-HDL-cholesterol component is calculated by subtracting HDL-cholesterol from total cholesterol in the nonprecipitated sample (Sehayek et al. 2003) . Some strains develop elevated cholesterol levels associated with increases in non-HDL levels after consuming high fat diets (Breslow 1994) .",

Immunoglobulins (Ig) As in humans, mouse immunoglobulins (Ig) are molecules composed of four polypeptide chains; two of lower molecular weight called light (L) chains, and two with higher molecular weight called heavy (H) chains. Disulfide bonds link one L chain to one H chain, and the two H chains to each other. Immunoglobulin H chains are composed of four to five domains, including an N-terminal variable region domain and four constant-region domains. In addition, structural differences in the constant-region domains of the heavy chain are used to classify the five different classes of immunoglobulin, IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgD. L chains are composed of only two domains and structural differences in these domains are used to classify L chains as either kappa or lambda type. In the mouse, 95% of serum Ig has kappa L chains. Any individual antibody secreting B cell (or plasma cell) will make a single Ig molecule composed of two identical H chains and two identical L chains. Mice make four subtypes of IgG: IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3. Certain strains, C57BL/6, C57B1/10, SJL, and NOD, do not make IgG2a but rather make a novel IgG2c.

This membrane-anchored protein inhibits C3 cleavage by accelerating decay of C3 convertases. In mice it is the major regulator of C3 in the skin (not kidney) and is a ligand for CD97 which, on cross-linking, leads to lymphocyte activation. CD59 is a membrane-anchored inhibitor of C5b-9 formation (MAC) and prevents C9 from binding the C5b-8 complex. Deficiencies of CD59 in humans lead to hemolytic anemia but not in mice. Membrane cofactor protein (MCP) is a major cofactor for factor I in humans causing cleavage of C3b and C4b deposited on self-tissue. In mouse MCP is only expressed in the testis. Complement receptors 1 and 2 are encoded by separategenes in humans but are produced by alternative splicing of a single gene in mouse. Mice have a complement receptor 1 (CR-1) related gene/protein Y (Crry) not found in humans, which is a membrane-anchored C3 inhibitor. It is the major regulator of C3 in mouse kidney and has some of the functions as MCP and CR1 in humans.

IL-11 stimulates proliferation and differentiation of monocytes and megakaryocytes causing thrombopoiesis. It also activates osteoclasts and enhances bone resorption, decreases new bone formation, and stimulates chondrocyte and synoviocyte production. IL-11 protects small intestinal epithelial cells from chemotherapy and radiation injury and ameliorates inflammatory bowel disease (Schwertschlag et al. 1999) . IL-11 inhibits adipogenesis, regulates neuronal differentiation, and regulates T-cell function (enhances TH2 and inhibits TH1 cytokine production). Overexpression of IL-11 in the lung causes airway remodeling, fibrosis, and mononuclear nodules analogous to the clinical picture in chronic asthma. IL-11 is also required for the uterine decidualization response (Robb et al. 2002; Zheng et al. 2001) .",

The p40 subunit is shared by IL-23, a cytokine with similar activities. Macrophage, monocytes, and dendritic cells produce IL-12 after activation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) on these cells by bacterial ligands. IL-12 induces production of IFN-7by TH1 and NK cells and intact IL-12 skews the balance between TH subsets in favor of TH1 cells. IL-12 binds to the IL-12 receptor that is composed of two subunits, [31 and ~2, on the surface of NK and TH1 cells. IL-12p40 interacts with IL-12R[31, and IL-12p35 binds IL-12R[32. Negative feedback regulation of IL-12 production involves down regulation of TLR signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PIKs).

This is a major homeostatic mechanism regulating the size of the T-cell pool and for eliminating T cells that repeatedly encounter self-antigens (Goldsby et al. 2003) .",

Some chemokines participate in both inflammation and homeostasis and are called dual-function chemokines. Many dual function chemokines are highly selective for the recruitment of T cells.

An exception is the inducing effect of lymphotoxin and TNF-~ on B-cell attracting chemokine-1 (BCA-I, CXCL13), CCL19, and secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC, CCL21), which also participate in inflammation. Leukocytes also release several kinds of proteases that degrade chemokines at their N-terminus, resulting in the loss of receptor binding, antagonist generation, or enhancing their biologic function. Leukocyte CD26, dipeptidyl peptidase IV is known to act on CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL12. Murine sulphostin inhibits the action of CD26 and stimulates G-CSF and granulopoiesis (Abe et al. 2005) .

Table 6 -3 lists the murine MMPs that can be quantified by commercially available ELISA kits. In addition to MMPs, cathepsins have been shown to modify chemokines. Table 6 -9 lists the murine chemokines and the proteases that degrade them and stimuli that induce them. Certain chemokines may antagonize the activity of other chemokines; for instance, three agonists for the receptor CXCR3 are also antagonists for receptor CCR3 (which is agonized by eotaxin [CCL11]). Because CXCR3 and CCR3 are differentially expressed on TH1 and TH2 cells, these chemokines [monokine induced by IFN-y (MIG/CXCL9), IFNinducible protein-10 (IP-10/CXCL10), and IFN-inducible T-cell chemoattractant (I-TAC/CXCL11)] modulate the TH subpopulation allowed to enter tissue sites favoring TH1 immune polarization (Moser et al. 2004) .

LTA4 is metabolized to LTB4 by LTA4 hydrolase or to cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4H, and LTC45) by LTC4 synthase. 5-LO expression is limited to neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and mast cells; however, LTA4 hydrolase is expressed in erythrocytes, T cells, platelets, airway and intestinal epithelial cells, fibroblasts, heart, kidney, and adrenal cortex. Because the latter cells and tissues do not express 5-LO, LTA4 must be delivered to them via myeloid cells by a process known as transcellular biosynthesis (Maclouf 1993) . Receptors for LTB4 (BLT1 and BLT2) have been identified and are either widely expressed (BLT2) or are confined to myeloid cells, T cells, and lung cells (BLT1). In addition to attracting myeloid cells to sites of inflammation, LTB4 is a potent inducer of TH1 and TH2 T effector cell chemotaxis (as potent as CXCL12 in the mouse) and CD8+T-effector cell chemotaxis (as potent as RANTES). Like PGD2, LTB4 plays a major role in allergic airway disease (Luster and Tager 2004) . Additional information on murine prostanoids and their receptors is available in recent reviews (Jala and Haribabu 2004; Kobayashi and Narumiya 2002) . All the arachidonic acid metabolites discussed in this section may be quantified using commercially available ELISA kits (see Table 6 -3).",

Intestinal AP activity was shown to vary four-fold between two strains of Swiss mice (Nayudu and Moog 1967) . This difference in activity was under polygenic control and influenced by a strain-specific factor in milk. TNAP is found in various tissues, and in each location, post-translation modifications may result in a different isoenzyme. Hoshi et al. (1997) used immunohistochemistry to localize these isoenzymes in mice to the following locations: bone tissue (specifically the entire cell surface of preosteoblasts and the basolateral cell membrane of osteoblasts), cartilage (mostly in chondrocytes of the proliferative and hypertrophic zones), the incisors (particularly the cells of the stratum intermedium, the subodontoblastic layer, the proximal portion of secretory ameloblasts, and the basolateral portion of odontoblasts), kidneys (on the brush borders of proximal renal tubules in kidney), liver (on cell membrane of the biliary canaliculi), and the placenta (on trophoblasts).",

(1980 demonstrated that serum AP activity decrease significantly after 3 months of age in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice of both sexes but increase again in very old (36 month old) mice. The high levels of serum AP seen in juveniles is related to increases in the bone AP isoenzymes, which is associated with osteoblastic activity due to rapid growth.

Specific isoenzyme distribution depends on differential expression of either the A and B subunits (Quimby 1999b) . For instance, all embryonic murine tissues contain LDH-5 because the A subunit is only expressed during early fetal development. As the embryo matures, subunit expression can involve both A or B subunits in different tissues, meaning that by birth and sexual maturity, each tissue contain a characteristic LDH subunit profile. In adult mice, the heart and erythrocytes contain LDH-1 and LDH-2, whereas most other tissues have LDH-3. Skeletal muscle and hepatocytes fail to express subunit B and therefore are composed predominantly of LDH-5.",

LH and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) are secreted by the same anterior pituitary cell in response to stimulation by gonadotrophinreleasing hormone (GnRH), which is synthesized in the hypothalamus.

            "text": "Pulsatile secretion of LH leads to great variations in blood concentration. In female mice, there is a 10-to 25-fold increase in basal LH levels in the afternoon of proestrus. In a study comparing young cycling C57BL/6 female mice to old females (40% of which not cycling), Flurkey et al. (1982) found lower LH levels in the older group and a more rapid rise in LH among younger cycling mice. These authors found that reproductive failure in male mice correlated with the loss of episodic release of LH. Female homozygous KO mice lacking the gene for the immediate early transcription factor NGFI-A were infertile secondary to LH-[3 deficiency. Although ovaries from these mice had a similar number of follicles, they lacked corpora lutea (Lee et al. 1996) . Basal levels of serum progesterone were lower in NGFI-A females (6.3 + 2.4 ng/ml) compared to wild type (11.3 +_ 3.6 ng/ml), whereas serum estradiol levels were similar in deficient (50.7 + 36.9 pg/ml) and wild-type (52.0 _+ 34.3 pg/ml) mice. Decreased amounts of mRNA encoding LH-[3, but not FSH-[3, were observed in NGFI-A-deficient mice; no changes were observed in mRNA levels for PRL or GnRH receptor between deficient and wild-type mice. An ovariectomy normally removes gonadal feedback inhibition, allowing for increased amounts of LH-~ and FSH-[3 in the pituitary; however, ovariectomy of NGFI-A deficient female mice lead to an increase in FSH-~ only. Homozygous NGFI-A deficient males did make lower amounts of LH-~ compared to wild-type males, but they made significantly more LH-[3 than did NGFI-A-deficient females. The levels of LH in males appeared to be sufficient for fertility, and they had normal serum testosterone levels. These results suggest that NGFI-A acts synergistically with transcription factor SF-1 to regulate the promoter for LH-[3 gene expression. The simultaneous activation of both SF-1 and NGFI-A by GnRH appears to confer the specificity of LH-~ synthesis. Female transgenic mice overexpressing LH are anovulatory, develop granulosa cell tumors, and undergo precocious puberty (Mann et al. 2003) . Excellent reviews detailing the use of transgenic and KO mice in elucidating the secretion and function of LH have been published (Bums and Matzuk 2002; Huhtaniemi et al. 2002; Wells and Murphy 2003) .",

Deficient male mice had a 34% reduction in testosterone-stimulated prostate growth and small testes compared to wild-type mice. Deficient females had a half-normal uterine growth response to exogenous E 2 and only a partial ductal growth response (in the mammary gland) following exogenous E 2 and progesterone. Serum concentrations of E 2 and testosterone were elevated 1.2 to 1.5 times wild-type levels, indicating an abnormality in the endocrine feedback control system.

(1982) compared the plasma levels of LH, progesterone, and PRL in cycling young (10-week) and old (8month) female C57BL/6J mice. They showed age-related deficits in the preovulatory levels of all three hormones. The LH elevations during the ascending and descending portions of the preovulatory surge were smaller; the slower rises in LH during the ascending phase of the surge correlated with decreased progesterone in older females. There was no correlation between LH or progesterone level and length of estrus cycle. Holinka et al. (1978) observed changes in plasma progesterone levels in young and old female mice during gestation. Older mothers had a much slower decline in circulating progesterone than younger mothers between gestational days 17-23. Because a major decrease in plasma progesterone is thought to be essential for the onset of uterine contractions and parturition in mice, the authors hypothesized that the attenuated decline in older mothers may account for their prolonged gestation. Surgimoto et al. (1997) engineered mice lacking the PGFzareceptor (FP) and found that deficient female mice had normal estrous cycles, ovulation, fertilization, and implantation but did not undergo parturition. These pregnant females were characterized by a decline in preparturition progesterone levels due to delayed luteolysis and failure to develop labor. Close examination revealed that near term there was no expression of the oxytocin receptor in the uterus of FP-deficient mice. When the ovaries of FP-deficient pregnant females were removed on day 19 of pregnancy, progesterone levels fell, uterine oxytocin receptors were expressed, and pups were born alive within 24 h. This study demonstrated that the role of PGF2~ is to initiate luteolysis, resulting in an immediate decline in progesterone levels. The subsequent induction of oxytocin receptors and their activation by bound oxytocin initiate labor. It is feasible that the age-associated prolongation of gestation in old female mice may involve a defect in PGFz,~-induced luteolysis. This mechanism for the induction of labor also explains the well-known observation that aspirin-like drugs (that inhibit COX metabolism) may delay parturition in women.",

In mouse and human TR~ and TR[3 encode nine mRNA isoforms through alternative splicing; four isoforms TR~I, TRc~2, TR[31, and TRI]2, are expressed as proteins. TRc~ ~ KO mice, which lack all products from the TR~ locus, are fertile and have normal basal thyroid status but have increased sensitivity to thyroid hormones in the pituitary and liver following provocative testing with increasing doses of T3. TR~x -/-have a disruption of the first coding exon in the TR~x locus, which prevents transcription of TR~I and TRy2 mRNAs but not TRA~I or TRA~2. These pups die shortly after weaning unless supplemented with T3 for the first 2.5 months of life, after which they develop normal thyroxine levels. However, both genders are infertile. TRy2 -/-overexpresses TR~I and are hypothyroid but have inappropriately normal TSH levels. They exhibit some signs of hyperthyroidism, such as increased heart rate, weight loss, and elevated body temperature. TR~ -/-lack all TR[3 isoforms and display resistance to thyroid hormones demonstrating the key role of TR~ in set-point control of the pituitary-thyroid feedback axis. TR[32 -/-KO mice have resistance to thyroid hormones and elevated T3, T4, and TSH. They have defective TSH suppression by T3. Several double KOs (both TR~ and TRI]) have been developed with profound resistance to T3. These targeted mutants have helped to elucidate the full function of thyroid hormones involving: bone formation and mineralization, abnormal development of skeletal muscle, disrupted development of the cones in the retina, abnormalities in the auditory system, cochlear and vestibular structures, delayed small intestine development, impaired thermogenesis, and altered development of the central nervous system and immune system (O'Shea and Williams 2002).",

Although T3 is the active hormone, its serum levels are so low that it is a less reliable indicator of thyroid status. Total T 4 ranges in Swiss Webster and ICR mice are 5.5 _+ 0.7 and 4.7 + 0.3 jag/ml, respectively. Total T3 levels range from 65-85 ng/100 ml in both SW and ICR stocks (DePaolo and Masoro 1989). Many factors, including autoantibodies, are known to interfere with thyroid hormone assays (Despres and Grant 1998; Reimers 1999) . 12. Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) PTH is synthesized by the chief cells of the parathyroid gland and secreted as an 84 amino acid peptide. Circulating levels of ionized calcium induce synthesis of PTH. Low calcium stimulates PTH synthesis, and high calcium inhibits secretion. The primary function of PTH is to control calcium concentrations in extracellular fluid and prevent hypocalcemia by increasing calcium resorption from bone, glomerular filtrate, and intestines (Reimers 1999) . PTH mediates its effect via its G-protein coupled receptor, PTH1R. Interestingly a second protein, PTH related protein (PTHrP), which is secreted by a variety of tissues and acts by autocrine and paracrine signaling, uses the same PTH1R. PTHrP modulates a wide range of physiologic and developmental responses (Goltzman and White 2000) . Mice with targeted mutations of the PTH, PTHrP, and PTH1R genes have demonstrated the critical role of these proteins in regulating both the switch between proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes and their replacement by bone cells (Schipani and Provost 2003) . Serum levels of PTH may be quantified in mice using a commercially available ELISA kit, which can also be used to quantify the protein in rats.",

Normally SAA is quickly cleaved to a small molecular weight product, but during chronic infection or failure in the degradation pathway, tissue deposition of amyloid may occur. Differences in serum concentrations have been described in various mouse strains and during disease. Commercial RIA and ELISA kits are available for its quantitation in mice (Quimby 1999b) .",

It is likely Afp arose due to gene duplication. AFP is present in fetal serum but the synthesis declines shortly after birth. Serum levels are regulated by two loci, Afr-1 and Afr-2, which are not linked to AFP. The action of these genes may be modified by TGF-~ and p53 (Wilkinson et al. 2005) . Levels in mouse serum have been quantified by immunoelectrophoresis (Zizkovsky 1975 ) and both polyclonal antibodies and recombinant DNA-derived mouse AFP are available for assay development (Boismenu et al. 1997) and are elevated in mice with certain neoplasms and during hepatic regeneration (Jin et al. 2005; Quimby 1999b ).",
