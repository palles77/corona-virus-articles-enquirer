The aim of this study was to demonstrate the distribution of FCV and FHV-1 among the feline population of several counties in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. To this end, conjunctival and nasal swabs were collected from 302 cats from different locations, including households, breeding catteries, veterinary clinics, animal hospitals and experimental research facilities. The samples were collected between July 2006 to June 2009. The virus isolation was performed in CRFK cells and, subsequently, the identification was confirmed by PCR. FCV, FHV-1, or both were isolated from 55 cats from 28 different locations. FCV alone was isolated from 52.7% (29/55) of the animals that tested positively, FHV-1 alone was isolated from 38.2% (21/55) of the animals that tested positively, and coinfection were detected in 9.1% (5/55) of the animals that tested positively. Virus detection was more prevalent in cats that were less than 1 year old, among animals that shared a living space with other cats, and females. FCV and FHV-1 were isolated from vaccinated cats. In addition, both viruses were isolated from cats that showed no signs of disease. The results suggest that a carrier state is common for both viruses in the evaluated population. A search for other causes of respiratory disease in that population is necessary; and further studies relating to the molecular characterization of viruses and vaccine efficacy are also necessary.",

It is a DNA virus that is a member of the Varicellovirus genus in the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily (11) . Only one serotype of this virus exists, and like other alphaherpesvirus, FHV-1 induces latency in nervous ganglions (11) . Thus, clinically recovered cats are carriers that undergo periodic episodes of virus reactivation, particularly after stress (11) . In both experimental and natural infections, symptoms include the following: depression, sneezing, inappetence, pyrexia and serous ocular and nasal discharges (11) . Cats of any age, sex or breed are susceptible, but a severe syndrome is usually restricted to kittens of up to six months of age (23) . It is estimated that more than 90% of the cats are seropositive to FHV; and that a minimum of eighty percent remains latently infected with 45% shedding the virus by all life long (18) .",

This vaccination likely contributed to the reduction of the number of cats in the Feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus population excreting FHV-1 but did not significantly affect the number of cats excreting FCV (12) . The biology of the viruses is one characteristic that could contribute to this finding; FCV is an RNA virus with wide genetic and antigenic diversity, whereas FHV-1 is a stable DNA virus (25) . In this article, the number of vaccinated cats excreting FHV-1 was higher than that excreting FCV (Table 2 ). However, it should be noted that there was a unique situation in this study that could cause such results. Most of the isolated FHV-1 came from breeding catteries where an outbreak of respiratory disease was occurring. Thus, many of the FHV-1-isolated cats came from the same location; furthermore, most of the vaccinated cats used in this study came from the same cattery.",

As previously noted, FHV-1 is typically isolated when animals present clinic manifestations, whereas FCV is isolated when they do not (12) . Again, virus biology is the most probable explanation for these results because FCV carriers excrete the virus continuously, whereas FHV-1 carriers excrete the virus only when it is reactivated (11, 13, 25) . The percentages of isolation were roughly 60% for FCV and 27% for FHV-1 (Table 2) . A comparison with other data shows only that FCV is more commonly isolated than FHV-1 because the prevalence detected varied as much as 15 to 25% for FCV and 0.2 to 33.3% for FHV-1 in one study (12) to 25% for FCV and 0.6% for FHV-1 in another study (3) . However, no virus was isolated from approximately 64% of the samples coming from cats showing signs of respiratory disease (Table 1) . This finding could be attributed to problems with sampling and storage conditions or even cases in which cats were sampled late in the course of disease, as has been reported in other studies (2, 29) . Nonetheless, there are other causes for respiratory and ocular diseases in felines other than FCV and FHV-1, including agents such as fungi, bacteria and other viruses (10) . Chlamydophila felis is a bacteria routinely identified in cases of conjunctival disease in cats. Bordetella spp., which is associated with mild respiratory signs, is also commonly identified (2) . Thus, cases of disease in cats from which neither virus was isolated could have other etiologic causes.",

            "text": "occasionally, oral and oropharyngeal swabs collected from cats with or without clinical signs of respiratory disease. The samples were collected from July 2006 to June 2009 from 302 cats from veterinary clinics and hospitals, residences, breeding catteries and experimental populations. The samples were collected from animals in the following counties of the Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil: Cachoeira do Sul, Canoas, Estrela, Nova Palma, Pelotas, Porto Alegre, Santa Maria and Santo \u00c2ngelo. All of the animal handling procedures were performed under veterinary supervision and following the recommendations of the Brazilian Committee on Animal Experimentation (COBEA, law #6.638 of May, 8 th , 1979). The experiments were approved by an institutional committee on animal welfare and ethics (UFSM -approval number # 61/2009). Cell culture and virus isolation The feline kidney cell line CRFK (Crandell-Rees feline kidney) was used for virus isolation and amplification. kept in microtubes with MEM medium (0.5 ml) and stored at -70\u00b0C until use in experiments. The swabs were briefly agitated in a vortex and the content was then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 10.000 x g for 5 min. The supernatants (0.15 ml) were inoculated onto CRFK cell monolayers grown in 24-well plates and were submitted to three passages of five days each while the cells were monitored for cytophatic effect (CPE). Cultures exhibiting CPE were investigated for the presence of feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1), or both viruses using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Three blind passages were performed for cultures not exhibiting CPE, and the cultures were considered negative for virus isolation. Extraction of DNA and RNA, primers and PCR Only one sample from each animal was tested by PCR and RT-PCR, including those from which the viruses were isolated from different swabs. Different samples isolated from the same cat were pooled to perform the PCR/ RT-PCR. The extraction of FCV RNA and FHV-1 DNA was performed using TRIzol and DNAzol reagents (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), respectively. The extractions were performed from cell cultures inoculated with the respective viruses following the manufacturer's protocol. After extraction, DNA was solubilized in 8 mM NaOH (0.2 ml) and stored at -20\u00b0C until further testing. The RNA was solubilized in 30 \u00b5l of ultra-pure water with DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) and stored at -70\u00b0C until use. The cDNA was synthesized in 20 \u00b5l of total solution containing the following: 2 \u00b5l of RNA (approximately 100 ng), 100 ng of random primers, 10X buffer from reverse transcriptase (RT), 25 mM MgCl 2, 10 mM dNTPs, 0.1 Mm DTT, 40 U RNaseOUT and 200 U RT (SuperScript TM III RT -Invitrogen). The solution was incubated at 65\u00b0C for 5 min, Feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 50 min and 85\u00b0C for 5 min. The cDNA was used as a template for the PCR for FCV identification. The ORF2 (regions B to F), which encodes the major capsid protein (25), was the target region for amplification of the FCV cDNA. The amplified product resulted in a fragment of 955 bp (base pairs). The primer sequences were 8F (forward) 5' -CACSTTATGTCYGACACTGA -3' (position 6142 B region) and 8R (reverse) 5' -CTRGADGTRTGCA RRATTT -3' (position 7097 F region), based on the FCV-F9 strain (GenBank access number M86379). The primers used were degenerate. The letters S, Y, R and D refer to C/G, T/C, A/G, and A/C/T, respectively, and were previously developed (19). The PCR conditions used were as it follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min for the initial denaturation, followed by 35 cycles of three steps of 94\u00b0C for 45 s, 48\u00b0C for 45 s, 72\u00b0C for 45 s, and a final extension of 7 min at 72\u00baC. For FHV-1 the thymidine kinase enzyme (TK) gene was the region of the viral DNA amplified by PCR. The primer set used in the reaction was previously developed (28), and the product size is 287 bp (GenBank access number M26660). The primer sequences used were as follows: Herp_F (forward) 5' -GACGTGGTGAATTATCAGC -3' (position 510 TK gene) and Herp_R (reverse) 5'-CAACTAGATTTCCACCAGGA -3' (position 797 TK gene). The PCR conditions used were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 45 s, 56\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 45 s and a final extension of 7 min at 72\u00b0C. The resulting PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. A commercial live attenuated vaccine to both viruses plus Chlamydophila felis, Felocell CVR-C (Pfizer Animal Health, USA), was used as a control in standardizing the PCR reactions and as a positive control in all of the tests. Two of the samples isolated in our lab and identified by electron microscopy (EM), SV65/90 (FCV) and SV534/00 (FHV-1); were also used as positive control in the reactions.Negative controls consisted of mock-infected CRFK cells.RESULTSA total of 572 swabs samples were collected from 302 domestic felines either with or without clinical signs suggesting infection by feline calicivirus (FCV) and/or feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1). Most of the samples were conjunctival or nasal swabs; only in two cases and one case were the swabs collected from the oral and oropharyngeal cavities, respectively (",

FCV alone was isolated from eight of thirteen cats kept together for experimental research. The cats from the breeding catteries were found to be only positive for FHV-1. There were six positive cats in each of two catteries and two cats from another breeding cattery. Among the cats from the veterinary hospitals, which came from four different locations, FCV was detected in two locations; both viruses were detected in the samples coming from cats obtained from these two locations. FCV was isolated from 66.6% (12/18), FHV-1 from 22% (4/18) and both viruses were isolated from 11.1% (2/18) of the samples coming from the remaining eighteen locations sheltering cats living with another cat or cats (data not shown). With regards to age, approximately 93% of the 55 cats exhibiting positive results for virus isolation were between 0 and 5 years old. Taking into consideration cats from which only one of the viruses or both viruses where isolated, FCV was isolated more often from cats between 1 and 5 years old, whereas FHV-1 was isolated more often from cats under 1 year old (",
