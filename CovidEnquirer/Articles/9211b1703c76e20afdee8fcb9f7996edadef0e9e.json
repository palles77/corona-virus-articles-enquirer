Jobs were dominated by nurses and non-Saudis were a majority whilst, the highly experienced, (>10 years) were a minority. A majority recognized the viral transmission methods, popular information sources of MERS-CoV and associated medical terms. Highest scores were observed in dealing with protective aids and recognizing symptoms of disease. High adherence to hand hygiene protocols and correct washing steps were recorded. Correct and high levels were observed in taking preventive measures and avoiding infection. Participants responded correctly to negative and wrong actions that patients should refrain from. High scores were observed in taking appreciable attitudes towards oneself and towards others.",

However, the rare contact between humans and bats implies hypothetically that they are the least responsible for the human infection. For deeper investigation to find the role that bats play as MERS-CoV risk factor of viral transmission, more research is needed [4] .",

Most of this coronavirus infections reported in Saudi Arabia were transmitted through human interactions within the health center boundaries, that might have been due to inadequate infection control within these areas [5] . symptoms in patients included fever, cough, shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms, associated with a mortality rate of 65% [6] . Most patients infected with MERS-CoV show signs of pneumonia and ARDS, as well as acute kidney injury in some of the cases [9] . Whether the severity of MERS-CoV in patients depends on other conditions is still not clear [10] . One study in Saudi Arabia reported that an overwhelming majority of patients with MERS-CoV had underlying comorbidities [6] . Previous studies suggest that patients with diabetes, chronic lung diseases, renal failure, or immunocompromised are prone to greater risk of severe coronavirus onsets, however, there is little evidence to suggest that such underlying comorbidities contributed to disproportionate infection of MERS-CoV [8] . The WHO estimated the mortality rate of the coronavirus to be approximately 30% [2] , [11] . Currently, the treatment is rather non-specific and there are no recommended antiviral agents [2] . Though, Nitazoxanide which is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug is being tested against influenza and other viral respiratory infections and it exhibited appreciable activity against MERS-CoV and other viruses by inhibiting their N protein expression [12] , [13] . Since human-to-human transmission is said to occur in more than 60% of the total infections, mostly involving medical staffs, inpatients prone to and are at an increased risk of MERS-CoV infection. The WHO suggested that infection in healthcare settings were due to overcrowding and insufficient control measures [14] . Secondly, it would be necessary for the patients to avoid contact with camels or to eat properly cooked camel meat [15] . Sufficient knowledge of the etiology and prevention of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus among healthcare professionals is essential in combating the virus.",

These prevention measures that include protection of the nose, eyes, and any other places that the medical staff can contract the disease from when caring for known or suspected cases of the Middle East coronavirus infection, should be observed [20], [21]. CDC [22] recommends that those infected individuals who do not have inpatient support can be cared for in isolation in their homes.People who are patients with diabetes, lung diseases, renal failure, or immunocompromised should avoid contact with camels or areas where camels are most likely to be found [5],[8]. In addition, the WHO recommends such patients to avoid undercooked camel meat, raw milk, and urine in addition to practicing proper hygiene.Finally, screening for coronavirus at border points as well as the issuing travel advisories and human/ camel movement restrictions are recommended to avoid cross-border spreading and infection. Also, high levels of vigilance should be implied to prevent infection from persons returning from the middle east region [2].
