In this report, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method was developed to assess the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Two internally quenched fluorogenic peptides, 1NC and 2NC, corresponding to the N-terminal and the C-terminal autocleavage sites of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , respectively, were used as substrates. SARS-CoV 3CL pro seemed to work more efficiently on 1NC than on 2NC in trans-cleavage assay. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the His41 residue, the N-terminal 7 amino acids, and the domain III of SARS-CoV 3CL pro were important for the enzymatic activity. Antibodies recognizing domain III could significantly inhibit the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The effects of class-specific protease inhibitors on the trans-cleavage activity revealed that this enzyme worked more like a serine protease rather than the papain protease.",

The crystal structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro was recently resolved by two groups [2, 3] , which reveal great similarity to the structure of the 3CL pro of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and of human coronavirus (strain 229E), all of which form dimers [2, 4] . Each monomer of the enzyme contains three structural domains: the first two domains form a chymotrypsin fold containing the catalytic site comprised of His41 and Cys145, and the third domain is a globular a-helical structure which is linked to domain II by a long loop [2] [3] [4] The extra helical domain III is unique for coronavirus 3CL pro because the picornavirus 3C proteases only contain the chymotrypsin fold, but have no extra domain [5] [6] [7] . The role of domain III in SARS-CoV 3CL pro is not quite clear but seems to be involved in dimer formation [3, 4, 8] . Due to its functional importance, SARS-CoV 3CL pro becomes an attractive target for structure-based drug designs against SARS [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

In this study, we have established a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method to assess the proteolytic activity of SARS-3CL pro . Two internally quenched fluorogenic (IQF) 11-mer peptides with N-terminus conjugated with an ortho-aminobenzoic acid (Abz) and C-terminus conjugated with a lysine-2,4-dinitrophenylamide (Lys-DNP) were synthesized and used as substrates. Upon cleavage of the substrate, the fluorophore was separated from the quenching group, generating a fluorescence signal [13, 14] . The enzymatic reactions were monitored in real time. Using the FRET-based method, we have characterized the enzymatic activities of a catalytic site-mutated 3CL pro (H41A), a N-terminus-deleted 3CL pro (D1-7), and a domain III-deleted 3CL pro (DIII). We also used the system to demonstrate that some protease inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies recognizing domain III had inhibitory effects on the proteolytic activity of SARS-3CL pro . The FRET-based real time assay provides an ideal platform for exploring the inhibitors against SARS-CoV 3CL pro and is a convenient system to study the kinetics of proteolytic reactions.",

Inhibitory effects of protease inhibitors on SARS-CoV 3CL pro SARS-CoV 3CL pro belongs to the cysteine protease family with a chymotrypsin fold, thus it is interesting to know whether it is inhibited by serine protease inhibitors or by cysteine protease inhibitors. The inhibitory effects of two serine protease inhibitors, TLCK and TPCK, and two cysteine protease inhibitors, NEM and E-64, were tested in this FRET-based assay. Data shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that both serine protease inhibitors reduced the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro in a dose-dependent manner. However, the results for the two cysteine protease inhibitors were inconsistent: while NEM had significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV 3CL pro , E-64 did not inhibit it at all. The data support the idea that SARS-CoV 3CL pro works following a general base mechanism like the serine proteases, but not following a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair catalytic mechanism like the papain protease [16] . However, NEM probably inhibits the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro via directly blocking the catalytic Cys145 residue, due to its ability to bind stoichiometrically to the sulfhydryl (SH) group of cysteine in the cysteine protease family.",

Although Phe, Val, and Met are tolerant at P2 for SARS-CoV 3CL pro [18] , the mutation of Leu-P2 to other hydrophobic residues decreases the reaction activity [17] .

Similar conclusion has also been reached for the 3CL pro of TGEV [4] . Previous crystal structure data have attributed this importance to the dimerization function mediated by these two domains [3, 4, 8, 12] . However, a recent study by Chen et al. reported that the N-terminal seven amino acids of SARS-CoV 3CL pro were not required for enzyme dimerization. Instead, they proposed that the N-terminus-deleted mutant had a conformation that reduced the size of the binding pocket, thus creating unfavorable conditions for substrate binding [19] . The discrepancy about the roles of the N-terminal seven amino acid residues is not completely resolved at this moment and it needs to be further investigated by different analytical methods. However, no matter what function the N-terminal domain may play, it is definitely important for the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , as demonstrated by our activity assay. Fig. 4 .
