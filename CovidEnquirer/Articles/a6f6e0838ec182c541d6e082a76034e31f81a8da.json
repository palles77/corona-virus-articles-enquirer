The EP field has witnessed rapid expansion in the number of therapeutic procedures treating a wide range of arrhythmias and in the new technologies available to perform these procedures. Because of the increasing complexity of equipment and procedures and an ever-expanding knowledge base, it was concluded that the field would benefit from a consensus document that would define the critical components and processes of a modern EP laboratory. To this end, the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) convened a multidisciplinary team to review EP laboratory design, ergonomics, personnel, equipment, occupational hazards, and patient safety, as well as clinical and ethical issues related to diagnostic and therapeutic EP procedures. The goal is to provide physicians, administrators, and regulatory personnel with the recommended requirements for building, staffing, and running a modern EP laboratory to optimize patient outcomes, minimize patient risk, and provide a safe and positive environment for physicians and staff.",

Clinical EP laboratories emerged in the late 1960s, and by the early 1970s, formal fellowships had been established and EP laboratories were taking shape. Firstgeneration EP laboratories often shared space with cardiac catheterization laboratories and were typically subordinate to coronary angiographic and hemodynamic procedures. When a space was dedicated for electrophysiological testing, it was often small, and fluoroscopy was delivered with portable Carm units. These laboratories were sufficient for diagnostic EP studies and electropharmacological testing. Secondgeneration EP laboratories developed in the 1980s with the introduction of catheter ablation and cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) to the electrophysiologist's armamentarium. Pacemaker implantation was shifting from the domain of surgery to that of cardiac EP. With increasingly complex procedures being performed in EP laboratories, more space was allocated to new dedicated laboratories and fluoroscopy equipment began to be upgraded to systems commensurate with those used in cardiac catheterization laboratories.",

This arrangement presents challenges that stem from the separation of the laboratory from vital hospital services. In the event of a life-threatening complication, such as pericardial tamponade 2 or endovascular tear during lead extractions, 3 an emergency response from certain hospital-based services such as cardiothoracic surgery can become necessary, and even possibly lifesaving. Performing EP procedures in freestanding EP laboratories on patients with clinical conditions that confer increased risk are relatively contraindicated. These include preexisting advanced heart failure and severe left ventricular dysfunction 4 ; recent myocardial infarction, recent stroke, chronic kidney disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and severe/morbid obesity 5 ; and severe valvular dysfunction or prosthetic heart valve, CHD (including atrial septal defect repair), active oral anticoagulation, advanced age, and pediatric age. Procedures that necessitate lesion creation close to coronary arteries, such as aortic cusp ablation 6 and epicardial ablation, 7 carry a higher risk of intraprocedural myocardial infarction and should not be performed outside a hospital. As part of the consent process, patients should be informed that the procedure is being performed without on-site surgical backup. In order to ensure the safety of a patient undergoing a procedure in a freestanding EP laboratory, a functional and tested system must be in place to quickly transfer patients to a hospital with immediate surgical support in case of an unanticipated complication.

It provides defined standards in terms of the space and functionality of EP laboratories with a goal to specifically improve work flow in the EP environment, acknowledging that the EP laboratory requires more space than an angiographic/interventional laboratory for supporting equipment and supplies. Traditionally, however, the construction of an EP laboratory had no specific guidelines because of its special applications. The typical layout is generally derived from a cardiac catheterization laboratory, 9 which is not ideal for the performance of the full range of EP procedures. The limitations of direct adaptation of an angiography suite design to the practice of cardiac EP include space constraints relative to the special equipment used in EP procedures, the necessity to work on either side of the patient table, and the requirement to access the patient's upper chest for device implantation. EP laboratory plans should take into account not only the available space within the procedure room but also its location relative to pertinent services such as the patient prep area, recovery area, OR, intensive care unit, the ward, and specialized resources such as an adjacent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suite that might permit real-time MRI imaging during procedures in the future. The rationale is to consider the proximity of all needed services in the overall design during the planning stage so that enhanced patient flow can be achieved. The aim of the planning committee should be to build a consensus on a minimum set of specifications that will meet the needs of the clinicians and support staff, and enable them to provide optimal patient care, while maintaining occupational safety for the staff.",

Because the EP procedure room is classified as a \"wet procedure location,\" the installation of an isolated power system with line isolation monitoring is required, which provides a layer of protection from the hazards of electric shock with the added benefit of line noise isolation because of its design. 9 In addition, all computer equipment directly related to the ongoing monitoring and treatment of a patient must have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The UPS may be integrated into the power for the entire suite, or individual UPS may be placed in line for each central processing unit. The main purpose of the UPS is to prevent the EP system, mapping system, or other critical imaging or monitoring system from going through a hard shutdown and full reboot procedure in case of a transient power outage or surge. Other important electrical components of the laboratory, such as the imaging train, should be connected to emergency backup power so that cases can be completed even if line power is lost. Power lines and data lines should be run separately and isolated from each other in different conduits to prevent EMI from power line wiring induced through data line wiring that could affect optimal performance of the EP equipment. If open cable trays are used above the ceiling, careful consideration should be given to the placement of power lines and other fixtures that can be sources of EMI. Although power lines used on these runs do not necessarily involve enough energy to induce heating, it is still a good rule to follow the specifications of Article 300.20 of the NEC Handbook as a reference. 11 Adequate spacing of EP laboratory equipment in the procedural area should be followed. Interface cables between the patient and the equipment (e.g., ECG cables and intracardiac catheter cables) should not dangle by the X-ray tube and should be kept neatly arranged by the side of the patient to provide easy access for troubleshooting purposes during the procedure.",

The ideal system is an always-on, full-duplex, two-way intercom system, with a toggle to silence unnecessary chatter from the control room. This requires electronic noise cancellation to prevent acoustical feedback and has variable effectiveness depending on room acoustics. A simpler solution is a oneway push-to-talk intercom, but this does not allow spontaneous back-and-forth communication. The use of wireless headsets is a favorable solution, which broadcasts spoken words directly to the headphone users, with simultaneous talk paths open as needed. Whatever system is selected should be high fidelity, spectrum friendly, and encrypted to prevent eavesdropping and potential HIPAA violations, making it a more expensive solution.",

The network cabling and hardware should have a minimum capability of support for gigabit Ethernet speed. 9 The data demands of imaging systems, including 3D electroanatomic mapping systems, are great and require larger storage repositories in comparison with the compressed images of major imaging equipment such as ultrasound and X-ray radiograph systems. There is an increased use of imaging created by computed tomography (CT) and MRI, which are 3D in nature, necessitating high transfer speeds between the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and the EP laboratory environment. Collaboration with the information technology (IT) department and its infrastructure within the institution is necessary in this venture. EP systems gather information in digitized format for patient records and review at a later time. It will be important for industry to develop a better and unified standard for storing and retrieving cardiac electrogram information. Waveform information in EP is constructively different from image information and needs to be handled in a different manner. The complexity involved in translating the files without losing the ability to utilize the tool sets needed during review, and to scroll through the whole EP study, is a challenge. The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine standard is a more robust model to follow and should be the preferred method, when feasible. 12 For current equipment standards and needs, the recommendation is to involve the IT department in the safekeeping of digital records of patient information. Storing information in an enterprise-wide network repository managed by the health care IT staff within the institution is recommended, as they are adequately equipped to comply with policies governing hospital data. Data storage must be HIPAA compliant 13 and must be maintained according to the laws of each individual state-typically 5-7 years for adults and 5-7 years past the age of maturity for pediatric patients. Practically, the duration of data storage should be longer than the minimum requirement, because old invasive study data are often important in the management of patients decades later. Electronic storage of all EP laboratory information could require 5-10 terabytes of space annually; therefore, the IT department must anticipate commitment of these resources for this process. Regardless of the equipment's capability to store to the network, the IT department should be involved as long as they comply with the EP equipment manufactureres' recommendations.",

Although standard table lengths are usually sufficient to accommodate most patients, there is growing need for the increased width provided by bariatric surgical tables. Motorized tables with adjustable height and a tilting capacity of up to 20\u00ba have become standard. Tilting into the Trendelenburg position may be helpful in cases of difficult subclavian venous access or internal jugular venous access in ablation and device procedures. Reverse Trendelenburg positioning can be helpful for patients unable to lie flat because of musculoskeletal or respiratory difficulties. Table rotation up to 180\u00ba facilitates patient transport but more importantly provides better access to the table head in cases of emergency. This feature, as well as the ability to tilt sideways, may also be helpful for maximizing surgical exposure in hybrid OR laboratories. Given the need to perform both right-and left-sided procedures, having rails on both sides of the table is particularly useful for mounting equipment and tableside controls.

            "text": "ICE is often useful as an adjunctive imaging modality during complex procedures. It has the potential to improve both the safety and the efficacy of a procedure. Dynamic visualization of intracardiac structures, catheters, and other procedural devices is possible using ICE. The ability to use this modality in real time is an advantage that improves the work flow of the procedure compared with using other pre-or postprocedural augmentative imaging modalities. Using ICE to directly visualize and confirm the proper position of the transseptal needle on the atrial septum can minimize procedural complications, such as cardiac perforation. Pulmonary vein stenosis can be avoided by using ICE to confirm an ostial position of the lasso catheter during pulmonary vein isolation. 20 Early detection of complications, such as pericardial effusion or intracardiac thrombus formation, can lead to earlier and more effective interventions. 21 Fluoroscopic exposure and its associated risks can be minimized when navigation of catheters and procedural devices are guided by using ICE. 22 The success of a procedure can depend on the recognition and successful navigation of challenging anatomy that can be detectable through ICE, such as a prominent Eustachian ridge during atrial flutter ablation, a crista terminalis ectopic tachycardia focus, or a ventricular arrhythmia involving the papillary muscles or aortic cusps. 23 Contact of the ablation catheter with tissue can be verified before the delivery of ablative energy, and ablative effects on the tissue can be monitored by assessing morphological changes, including tissue swelling and increased tissue echogenicity. Presently, two different types of ICE systems are available: systems using a linear phased array transducer that produces a 90\u00ba image longitudinal to the catheter and systems that use a rotational transducer to display a 360\u00ba image perpendicular to the catheter. Each system has relative advantages and disadvantages, and their selection is based on operator preference. Some ultrasound catheters can work with 3D electroanatomic mapping systems and can import 2D ultrasound images to augment 3D electroanatomic mapping. 24 Despite the potential value of ICE, reviewed in detail above, it is important to recognize that clinical trials are not available to demonstrate that the use of ICE improves the outcomes or safety of ablation procedures. Although some operators and centers depend heavily on ICE, many others use it only in selective situations. ICE substantially increases procedure costs, requires an additional site for vascular access, and requires extensive training in order to accurately interpret the images. 25 ",

A simpler robotic approach to control the catheter movement involves the use of a robotic arm to remotely manipulate a steerable ablation catheter exactly as an operator would manipulate the catheter directly. 27 Although the operator sacrifices the tactile feel of catheter manipulation with this system, it allows the operator to move to a radiationfree space and to perform the ablation from a seated position.",

The model using a fixed number of separate monitors, each displaying a single signal, is not well suited for laboratories using multiple systems and performing complex procedures. Modern advanced laboratories have increasingly taken advantage of integrated data display systems (IDDSs). These IDDSs replace the multiple fixed monitors with a single large screen that displays multiple signals, thereby allowing the physician and laboratory staff to display as many images as required in whatever layout they choose. Not only do IDDSs enhance flexibility, they also diminish the physical requirements for monitoring, thereby liberating space within the EP laboratory. The drawback of IDDSs is the addition of another layer between the operator and the source systems that may be susceptible to image distortion or complete failure that would affect all signals. Thus, it is necessary to have separate backup monitors for critical functions in case of failure. Lastly, IDDSs should have a simple, intuitive user interface; otherwise, any benefit they provide would be outweighed by issues relating to the complexity of use.",

Remote surgery has been demonstrated using the current generation of remote catheter navigation technologies and has been further bolstered by the addition of newer laboratory integration systems.

The majority of programs encourage a second year non-ACGME advanced fellowship. The 2013 guidelines for advanced training in pediatric and congenital EP represent procedural requirements for those completing training. 37 The clinical competence statement on invasive electrophysiology studies, catheter ablation, and cardioversion, 34 supplemented by expert consensus statements on CRNA \u00bc certified registered nurse anesthetist; CV \u00bc cardiovascular; EP \u00bc electrophysiology; MD \u00bc physician; NP \u00bc nurse practitioner; PA \u00bc physician assistant; TEE \u00bc transesophageal echocardiography. * In procedures performed with deep sedation/analgesia, the CRNA or nurse administering sedation/anesthesia should have no responsibilities other than monitoring the patient. A second nurse or technologist must be available to circulate and document. However, in procedures performed with moderate or light sedation, this individual may assist with minor, interruptible tasks once the patient's level of sedation/analgesia and vital signs have stabilized, provided that adequate monitoring for the patient's level of sedation is maintained. 52 transvenous lead extraction, 8 catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation, 38 and catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias, 39 provides guidelines for appropriate training in CCEP. This document is scheduled to be updated in the near future. As training standards evolve, these minimum requirements will be updated regularly. A successful passage of the ABIM CCEP board examination is required to receive the Certificate of Added Qualification in CCEP. A similar but alternate pathway is available for doctors of osteopathy through the American Board of Osteopathic Medicine. Physicians for whom these pathways are unavailable because of international training or pathway choices and who are actively involved in the clinical management of EP patients may choose to certify through the IBHRE with the Certification Examination for Competency in Cardiac Electrophysiology. Physicians performing complex catheter ablation procedures, such as atrial fibrillation/complex atrial tachycardia ablation and VT ablation, should treat at least 25 cases of each with an experienced mentor before becoming independent. Alternatively, they should perform these procedures during their CCEP training program, as recommended by the 2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation 38 and the 2009 EHRA/HRS expert consensus on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias. 39 A number of training pathways can lead to the practice of implanting CIEDs. Although physicians who are board certified in CCEP have met minimum training standards for CIED implantation, some cardiovascular diseases (CVD) board-certified physicians and some American Board of Surgery-certified cardiac, thoracic, and general surgeons also devote a substantial portion of their practice to the prescription, implantation, and follow-up of CIEDs. The criteria established by the ABIM program requirements 28 and the Recommendations for Training in Adult Cardiovascular Medicine Core Cardiology Training document 33 strongly recommend that any non-CCEP-certified physician who wants privileges for ICD implantation in adults completes formal training in this field. Achieving CCDS from the IBHRE for CIED prescription, implantation, and follow-up is strongly recommended.",

            "text": "The goal of analgesia and anesthesia in the EP laboratory should be to provide a safe, nontraumatic experience for the patient. The administration of anesthesia varies among case types and among institutions, from anxiolysis or moderate procedural sedation by an Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)/Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS)-certified nurse under the supervision of the cardiac electrophysiologist 51,52 to monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia administered by an anesthesiologist or CRNA under the supervision of the anesthesiologist. The health care institution must require those administering or supervising moderate sedation who are not anesthesiologists to meet the requirements of the American Society of Anesthesiologists to obtain privileges. 53 Credentialing for this privilege must be periodically renewed. If intravenous procedural sedation will be used, the physician must establish an American Society of Anesthesiologists classification and Mallampati score for the patient before the procedure. 36 It is necessary to have these assessments done before the procedure so that, if necessary, alternate plans for sedation may be arranged to optimize patient safety and minimize procedural delays. Medications typically employed include etomidate, propofol, ketamine, fentanyl, midazolam, methohexital, and inhalational agents. Individual states regulate what medications can be administered by nonanesthesiologists. As the provision of sedation is a continuum and the depth of sedation may vary, best practice is that all patients receiving moderate or deep sedation be evaluated by continual observation of qualitative clinical signs, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, heart rate and rhythm, and monitoring for the presence of exhaled carbon dioxide to ensure the adequacy of ventilation unless precluded or invalidated by the nature of the patient, procedure, or equipment. 51 Monitoring equipment should be in working order and have appropriate audible alarms. In pediatric cases, factors to be considered for the choice of sedation or general anesthesia include young age, preexisting medical conditions, presence of CHD, airway issues, physician or family choice, and the length and complexity of the procedure. The 2002 NASPE Position Statement on Pediatric Ablation delineated the types of anesthesia (conscious sedation, moderate sedation, and general anesthesia), and these remain applicable. 54 Regardless of whether the administration of sedative agents is under the control of the electrophysiologist or another caregiver, the electrophysiologist must have a working knowledge of the effects of the agents used and how they might impact the electrical aspects of the procedure (such as arrhythmia inducibility and effects on blood pressure) or interact with other medications that may be given. Deep sedation or general anesthesia can minimize patient discomfort, can benefit the EP procedure by preventing patient movement, and is necessary during defibrillation threshold testing. An immobile patient facilitates accurate and precise 3D mapping and reduces risk during transseptal puncture, pericardial access, or ablation in close proximity to critical structures. Note that in cases where the assessment of phrenic nerve function is important for a favorable case outcome (such as placement of a coronary vein branch pacing lead or ablation within the right superior pulmonary vein), paralytic dosing should be reduced or eliminated. Improved safety, efficacy, and procedure times have been shown with the use of general anesthesia with certain procedures such as atrial fibrillation ablation. 55 Using high-frequency ventilation can further minimize respiration-related cardiac movement during ablation. 56 Although adequate sedation should be administered to ensure patient comfort because certain arrhythmias such as atrial tachycardias and outflow tract VTs can be dependent on adrenergic tone, excessive sedation can result in the inability to induce the clinical arrhythmia. In cases in which an adrenergicdependent arrhythmia is suspected, sedation must be minimized until the clinical arrhythmia is induced and mapped. Deep sedation is usually administered while performing ablation to prevent patient movement. When assessing the end point in these cases, care must be used to differentiate the effect of sedation from the actual elimination of the arrhythmia.",

Smaller electrodes and narrower interelectrode spacing detect a more local activation signal and can provide more precise activation mapping, but may be less maneuverable. Activation confined to a small structure or circuit, such as the His bundle or an accessory pathway, however, may be difficult to localize with narrow electrode spacing. The field of signal detection can be increased either by changing to a catheter with wider electrode spacing or by reconfiguring the electrode pairing. With this wider field of view, anatomical localization is decreased. Some diagnostic catheters are designed with electrodes in a specialized spatial configuration, such as circular/ring, basket, or star-shaped catheters. These catheters can enable rapid deciphering of an activation pattern even with a paucity of arrhythmia.

Catheter factors such as torque delivery, axial stiffness, steerability, and introducer diameter affect device selection. Ablation modes, including RF, cooled RF, laser, and cryothermy all have their strengths and weaknesses. The goal is to achieve a therapeutic ablation by identifying the ablation target, maneuvering to that site, and then destroying enough tissue to prevent arrhythmia initiation/propagation while minimizing the risk of collateral injury. The use of open-irrigated tip catheter ablation may result in the infusion of 2-3 L of volume during the case, which can precipitate heart failure in susceptible patients. 59 Multielectrode or \"single-shot\" ablation systems are being developed for the treatment of complex substrates such as atrial fibrillation. Experience with many of these technologies is limited. A preferred device for these applications may emerge in the future as our experience increases. Selecting the appropriate ablation catheter is a process that involves a correct interpretation of the arrhythmia mechanism, a firm understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of the different catheters and energy sources, and the need for the responsible use of resources. 60 8.2.6. Optimizing Signal Recording Bipolar intracardiac recordings are standard in most laboratories because they theoretically detect only near-field signals, unlike unipolar recordings that incorporate both near and far-field components. 61, 62 Far-field signals can still be detected in bipolar recordings but are typically a lower amplitude and frequency. Unipolar recordings can be helpful in mapping sites of focal activation, such as ventricular insertion sites of accessory pathways in preexcitation syndromes and idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias, in which deep sharp QS configurations signify a site from which activation emanates (i.e., site of the earliest ventricular activation). The unipolar signal can help clarify the content of the bipolar electrogram (near vs. far-field), the timing of actual local depolarization (intrinsicoid deflection of the unipolar signal), and the relative proximity of the tip vs. the ring electrode to the ablation target.",

Gray (Gy) is the International System of Units (SI) of absorbed radiation dose of ionizing radiation, which has replaced the term radiation absorbed dose (in rad). One gray is the absorption of 1 J of ionizing radiation by 1 kg of matter (equivalent to 100 rad), and it assesses the potential biological risk to that tissue. The U. S. unit for absorbed dose is rad. 1 Gy \u00bc 100 rad. Equivalent dose Sievert (Sv) is a measure of equivalent dose, and is also an SI unit. It takes into account the different probability of effects that occur when the same amount of absorbed dose is delivered by different types of radiation (protons vs. X-rays). It is equal to the absorbed dose in Gy multiplied by the radiation weighting factor, W R , and other modifying factors. The W R is 1 for X-rays. The equivalent dose can be used to assess radiation risk if the person's whole body is uniformly irradiated. For partial body exposure, such as cardiac electrophysiology, additional correction is necessary to assess the radiation risk. Effective dose is used to assess the risk when only a part of the body absorbs energy from radiation. Since some organs in the body are more sensitive to radiation effects than others, the equivalent dose is multiplied by the appropriate tissue weighting factors. This terminology is used to assess the risk of radiationinduced cancer and hereditary effects. For example, the effective dose for a typical chest X-ray radiograph is 0.0001 Sv (0.1 mSv). The U.S. unit for sievert (Sv) is rem. 1 Sv \u00bc 100 rem. As low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) standard is a system for limiting the amount of radiation a person receives. Radiation exposure should be justified on the basis of the assumption that there is no threshold below which ionizing radiation is free from harmful biological effects and that shielding from radiation exposure is needed, no matter how low the dose.

The guidelines for the implantation of cardiac rhythm devices in young patients and patients with CHD were last updated in 2008. 76 Epicardial pacing is used for those in whom transvenous pacing is contraindicated, such as prosthetic tricuspid valves, right-to-left intracardiac shunts, and small patient size, or for those undergoing concomitant heart surgery. The majority of ICDs are implanted via the transvenous route, but this may not be possible in some individuals because of anatomical constraints. Because ICD leads are larger and prone to fibrosis, patient size limitations for transvenous systems are considerable. Although established in adults, the indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy in children are less certain and are based on retrospective reviews, rather than randomized trials. 77,78",

Strategies for radiation dose reduction as detailed in Section 11 should be aggressively implemented. The most significant complications in small children include pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, atrioventricular block, and death. 79, 80 Animal and clinical studies have shown the potential expansion of scar tissue with maturation 70 and the risk of late coronary artery injury 79 potentially related to ablation location. The risk of atrioventricular block is increased by small patient size and septal pathways, presumably because of the smaller anatomical dimensions of structures. Smaller tip catheters, lowered RF energy, shorter lesion duration, and the use of apnea and pacing techniques may diminish risk. 81 Cryoablation is perceived as being safer, but may have a higher recurrence rate compared with RF lesions. 82 It is recommended that EP laboratories conducting procedures on pediatric patients have cryoablation capability.",

The goal of the program should be to motivate and encourage physicians and staff to participate and to take initiative in the QA/QI process and overall success of the laboratory. It is acknowledged that there is little published data on the QA/QI process in the EP laboratory and that expert consensus is the primary basis for our recommendations. Further research and development of quality metrics specific to the practice of cardiac EP is ongoing.",

These components include national requirements for tracking (e.g., device implants), minimum acceptable complication rates (e.g., infections), and compliance with national registries, including the NCDR ICD Registry. A QA/QI program must ensure that key data are collected prospectively and systematically. When the QA/QI team is identifying potential quality metrics, either strong scientific evidence or expert consensus must support the metric. The metric must measure areas important to patient care, and it is best if it covers an aspect of practice where there is a gap in patient care. The data must be available in a usable format for future analysis. These data allow the laboratory to benchmark its performance and provides a reference by which appropriate changes can be made.",

It is the responsibility of each institution to ensure staff credentialing, maintenance of certification, and necessary CME requirements are met (see Section 7) . Practitioners should be expected to adhere to published practice guidelines unless the reason for deviation is documented. Clinical situations not directly addressed by the guidelines inevitably arise and require judgment and skill to address. Periodic peer review of cases that fall outside the guidelines is recommended to ensure appropriate delivery of care. The guidelines evolve and, by definition, require a consensus of data before they can be written and revised. The writing group recognizes and encourages the development of new clinical pathways and tools. This development is best achieved through research protocols that adequately capture patient demographic characteristics, procedure characteristics, and outcomes. The research consent process ensures that patients are aware that the treatment being offered is beyond the current recommendations of the practice guidelines. Procedure outcomes, including success rates and complications (and ideally including 30-day outcomes), should be documented and recorded. The writing group recognizes that success for some procedures requires clinical follow-up (particularly atrial fibrillation and VT ablation procedures). In these instances, an acute end point for the procedure should be specified (e.g., pulmonary vein isolation, noninducibility for VT, or creation of a planned RF ablation lesion set based on the results of an endocardial voltage scar map) and documentation should indicate if the end point was achieved. An assessment of freedom from arrhythmia recurrence after 1 year of followup should be performed. Risk-adjusted models are not well developed by which the relative frequency of complications and successful outcomes among different patient populations can be interpreted and physician results compared. Therefore, the interpretation of success rates and complication rates requires judgment by peers. Physicians should participate in regularly scheduled QI and/or peer review meetings to maintain privileges and evaluate procedural appropriateness. A quarterly EP laboratory morbidity and mortality conference (stand-alone or as a component of another conference) should be mandatory, with attendance documented.",

            "text": "The predominant strategy for minimizing radiation exposure to patients is to minimize the radiation dose. 86, 92 The most effective approach is to minimize fluoroscopy pedal time. Operators should develop the habit of tapping the fluoroscopy pedal rather than standing on the pedal for a long period of time. If the eyes stray from the fluoroscopy screen, the foot should come off the pedal immediately. Decreasing the fluoroscopy pulse rate will significantly reduce dose at the cost of temporal resolution of the image. Supplementation of fluoroscopic imaging with nonfluoroscopic electroanatomic guidance systems by using stored fluoroscopy loops rather than cine loops and using pulsed fluoroscopy will reduce the total procedural dose. As the X-ray tube gets closer to the patient, X-rays at the skin entry point increase and the risk of deterministic injury also increases; thus, the operator should position the table at a comfortable height with some distance between the tube and the patient. If the image intensifier is not positioned as close to the patient as possible, the image will be magnified but the radiation dose will be much higher. To magnify the image, use the appropriate magnification mode. Both geometric and electronic magnification increases dose to the patient. Doses may be limited effectively by collimation, limiting the field of view with shutters as much as possible. For example, reducing the diameter of the field of view by 29% will reduce the radiation dose by half. Steeply angulated projections should be avoided, and if used, the C-arm should be repositioned somewhat throughout the procedure to avoid delivering radiation to the identical skin entry site. Depending on which procedure is being performed, local shielding of the patient's thyroid and gonads can be employed. 93 Since the stochastic effects of radiation exposure are cumulative, the caregiver should be sensitive to the lifetime exposure of the patient to ionizing radiation. There has been active discussion among regulators on implementing a system for lifetime tracking of radiation exposure to patients, but the tools for this type of system are not available, and therefore it is not presently mandated. 94 It is important to emphasize that radiation exposure is dependent on the age and condition of the equipment. Thus, aggressive limitation of fluoroscopy pedal time is desirable, but those efforts may be futile if the dose rate is high because of a high frame rate or employment of an old imaging train. It is now an accepted standard that fluoroscopy dose, not only fluoroscopy time, is entered in the permanent medical record for each fluoroscopic procedure. Ideally, the peak skin dose, the reference air kerma, the kermaarea product, and the fluoroscopy time should be recorded for every case. 95 A review of fluoroscopy use by individual operators should be part of every laboratory's QA process.",

Radiation dissipates in proportion to the square of the distance from the source, and so even a modest effort to move away from the tube will significantly reduce exposure. Radiation scatter occurs as radiation from the generator tube enters the patient and is partially reflected or refracted by body tissues. Scatter from the patient is the main source of radiation exposure to the patient outside the imaging field and to the operator. The operator and laboratory personnel must be protected from exposure to the scatter radiation with shielding. A minimum of 0.5-mm lead-equivalent protective apron, thyroid shield, and eye protection should be used.",

Shield extensions above the table rail and a contoured ceilingmounted shield in contact with the patient's torso will substantially reduce operator exposure. Since radiation doses decrease with the square of the distance from the source, the operator should perform the procedure as far from the radiation tube as is practical.

The basic principle is that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions (except sweat), nonintact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. Since it is impossible to identify all sources of all infectious agents, the same precautions are applied to every patient at every encounter. Each institution has a detailed description of how standard precautions are implemented. The following text highlights certain aspects particularly pertinent to EP laboratory processes.",

Hand-washing supplies should be readily accessible in the EP laboratory and environments. Sterile gloves are indicated for any surgical procedure, invasive radiologic procedure, and procedures involving vascular access (central lines). Examination gloves are indicated in clinical situations where there is potential for touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and items visibly soiled by body fluids. Splash protection with masks and eye shields is recommended when working with arterial and venous catheterization. Gloves are not indicated (except for contact precautions) for tasks involving direct patient exposure, including taking blood pressure, pulse, and temperature; administering intramuscular and subcutaneous injections; bathing and dressing the patient; transporting the patient; and any vascular line manipulation in the absence of blood leakage, or with indirect patient exposure, including using the phone, writing in the chart, removing and replacing linen for the patient's bed, and placing noninvasive ventilation equipment and oxygen cannula. 110 Safe injection practices, including the use of needleless injection systems and proper disposal of any sharps and other equipment used for invasive procedures, are paramount. Single-dose vials are preferable to multiple-dose vials, particularly if the vial will be used for multiple patients.",

Contact precautions require the use of gowns and gloves when there is any contact with the patient or the surrounding area. Droplet precautions are invoked when infectious respiratory droplets can travel directly from the patient's respiratory tract to the recipient, generally over short distances. This necessitates facial protection, such as surgical mask, eye protection, and/ or face shield. Personal eyeglasses and contact lenses are not considered adequate eye protection. 110 Historically, the area of defined risk has been a distance of 3 ft or more around the patient, although depending on the size of the droplets (smallpox and SARS are examples of small droplets), the infective area may be up to 6 ft from the patient. Droplets do not remain infectious over long periods of time and therefore do not require special air handling and ventilation. Airborne infection isolation precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus [measles], varicella virus [chicken pox], Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and possibly SARS coronavirus). If at all possible, EP procedures should be deferred in these patients unless a negative airflow procedure room is available. If an EP procedure is unavoidable, a regular positive pressure procedure room with airflow similar to an OR and a portable highefficiency particulate air filtration unit may be used. 110, 111 The patient should wear a surgical mask, and the staff should wear N95 filter masks. The procedure should be the last case of the day, and the room left empty until adequate air exchange has taken place to clear the room.",
