Both are chemically modified polypeptides, and their entire amino acid sequences are known (Fiers et al, 1978; Reddy et &, 1978) . It is thought that T-ag mediates most of the events culminating in cellular transformation by SV40. Accordingly, a vast array of biochemical and biological functions has been attributed to this polypeptide (reviewed by Martin, 1981; Tooze, 1981; Rigby and Lane, 1983) . However, the molecular basis for its multifunctional capacity remains obscure.",

The modifications reported for T-ag include phosphorylation (Tegtmeyer et al, 1977) , N-terminal acetylation (Mellor and Smith, 19'78) , poly-ADP-ribosylation (Goldman et cd, 1981) , fatty acid acylation (Klockmann and Deppert, 1983) , and glycosylation (Schmidt-Ullrich et cd, 1977 . However, the evidence suggesting that T-ag possesses the latter modification (i.e., glycosylation) is both limited and indirect. Therefore, we have addressed this question by performing detailed biochemical studies. The results of these analyses establish that Tag is glycosylated and that its oligosaccharide moiety (or moieties) contains galactose and glucosamine and/or their derivatives. The oligosaccharides probably do not contain mannose or fucose and are resistant to treatment with endo+N-acetylglucosaminidase H (EndoH). In addition, glycosylation of T-ag is not inhibited by tunicamycin (TM), suggesting that it is not an N-linked, but rather, is probably an O-linked glycoprotein.",

            "text": "Glycosylation of viral transformation proteins has been recognized in only a few retrovirus systems and has not previously been conclusively demonstrated with any DNA tumor virus. All of the known retroviral transformation glycoproteins are N-glycosylated (Dresler et aL, 1979; Hayman et aL, 1983; Privalsky et cd, 1983) ; none has been shown to be Oglycosylated. Only a single viral glycoprotein, the El matrix glycoprotein of certain coronaviruses, is believed to be exclusively 0-glycosylated (Holmes et d, 1981; Niemann and Klenk, 1981) . Thus, the demonstration of 0-glycosylation of SV40 Tag provides a novel basis for further investigation of T-ag multifunctionality, particularly with respect to the significance of this modification. In addition, Tag may be a useful model for the study of O-linked glycoproteins in general, which remain relatively poorly characterized. MATERIALS AND METHODS CeZ.Zs and wirus. TC-7 cells (Robb and Huebner, 1973) were propagated in enriched Eagle's minimum essential medium (E-MEM; GIBCO, Grand Island, N. Y.; Noonan et al, 1976) . MmFjmt/cl cells (Owens and Hackett, 1972) , mammary tumor cells that produce mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), were propagated in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (D-MEM, GIBCO; Slagle et d, 1984) . Wild-type SV40 was passaged at a low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) and plaque assayed in TC-7 cells (Noonan and Butel, 1978) . Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Indiana strain) was passaged and titrated as described for SV40, except that it was not subjected to freeze-thawing. C3H mouse mammary tumor virus [(C3H)-MMTV] concentrates were provided by the Biological Carcinogenesis Branch, Division of Cancer Cause and Prevention, National Cancer Institute. Antisera Normal hamster serum (NHS), hamster ascites fluid containing antibodies against T-ag (HAF), normal rabbit serum (NRS), and rabbit antiserum against purified T-ag (RacuT) or disrupted (C3H)-MMTV (cYMMTV) have been previously described (Lanford and Butel, 1979; Slagle et aL, 1984) . Rabbit antiserum against purified VSV (RbaVSV) was generously provided by Dr. Trudy Morrison. T-ag or cellular protein p53-specific monoclonal antibodies used in this study included PAb 100, 101, and 122 (Gurney et cd, 1980) , PAb 204 Hoeffler, 1980), and PAb 402, 405, 414, 416, 419, 421, 423, and 430 (Harlow et aL, 1981) . Hybridomas were cultured and antibodies were precipitated from culture supernatants as previously described (Harlow et cd, 1981; Santos and Butel, 1984) .",

A corn&rating polypeptide, presumably T-ag, was also detected in PHlgalactose-(lane 8) and mlucosamine-labeled (lane 16), infected cell extracts immunoprecipitated with HAF; it was absent in the corresponding mock-infected or NHS-treated controls (lanes 5-7 and 13-15).

            "text": "It was possible that the relatively short (3 hr) labeling time used in the initial experiments had not permitted equilibration of intracellular sugar pools with each input labeled monosaccharide, producing false negative results. Therefore, SV40infected cells were labeled for 3, 6, or 18 hr using tritiated galactose, glucosamine, or mannose, and samples were processed as before. Radioactive T-ag was detected in all of the galactose-labeled samples and in the 18-hr glucosamine-labeled sample, but was not detected in any of the mannose-labeled samples (Fig. 2) . These observations support the interpretation that putative T-ag oligosaccharide(s) contain galactose and glucosamine and/or their derivatives but lack mannose. It was not firmly established that the oligosaccharide(s) lack fucose, since that sugar was labeling of SV40 T-ag with various monosaccharides. Confluent TC-7 monolayers were infected with SV40 as described in the legend to Fig. 1 . Cells were labeled without prior glucose starvation from 6 to 24 hr p.i. (18 hr; lanes l-3), 18-24 hr p.i. (6 hr; lanes 4-6), or 21-24 hr p.i. (3 hr; lanes 7-9) with 20 &i/ml Djl-%Jgalactose (lanes 1, 4, 7), D-Cl-%Jglucosamine (lanes 2, 5, 8), or D-f% 'Hlmannose (lanes 3, 6, 9). Samples were then processed and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 , using HAF for immunoprecipitation and 8% acrylamide gels for analysis. Molecular weight markers are shown on the left. not included in this experiment. However, except for the 18-hr galactose-labeled sample, T-ag was not as intensely labeled in this experiment as in the experiment shown in Fig. 1A . Thus, shorter pulses with higher concentrations of radioactive sugars generally provided better incorporation than longer pulses with lower concentrations, suggesting that adequate uptake of the input sugars had occurred under those labeling conditions. Preliminary experiments using [35S]methionine labeling had established the maximal time of T-ag synthesis under our conditions of infection to be about 20-24 hr pi. (data not shown). This time period was chosen for the experiments described above since a large amount of T-ag would be available for labeling and the detection of monosaccharide-labeled T-ag would be optimized. However, if glycosylated T-ag represents a discrete subpopulation of Tag, then its maximal time of synthesis might differ from that of overall T-ag synthesis. Therefore, we examined the absolute and relative incorporation of [?S]methionine and [3Hlgalactose into Tag at various times p.i. The absolute incorporation of both isotopes was greatest at 21-24 hr p.i., suggesting that maximal glycosylation occurred at the same time as maximal overall T-ag synthesis (Table  1) . However, the relative incorporation of [3Hlgalactose compared to [35S]methionine was highest very early in infection, as shown by 3H:35S ratios (Table 1 ). The ratio decreased steadily until about 12 hr p.i., then remained approximately constant until 48 hr p.i. This result might indicate that relatively more T-ag molecules or more sites on T-ag are glycosylated early in infection. Although a large degree of variability in the 3H:35S ratios was observed among different experiments, the ratio repeatedly decreased with time after infection.",

As expected, PAb 419 immunoprecipitated both polypeptides from [35S]methionine-labeled infected cell extracts (Fig. 4) . Coomassie blue staining revealed that both large T-ag -and small t-ag were also immunoprecipitated from galactose-labeled infected cell extracts (data not shown).

In addition, it is likely that the glycosylation sites on large T-ag are not located within the region of the polypeptide encoded from nucleotides 5163 to 4917, since that is the region in common with small t-ag.",

The incorporation of pS]methionine should be inhibited by the presence of unlabeled amino acids but unaffected by the presence of unlabeled sugars. Conversely, if malactose were incorporated into T-ag in the form of sugar, that incorporation should be unaffected by unlabeled amino acids but inhibited by unlabeled sugars. The results with [\"S]methionine labeling were as predicted; 63 and 82% inhibitions were observed when labeling was performed in the presence of 5X and 10X amino acids, respectively (Fig.  5A, Table 2 ). No inhibition was observed with up to 10X sugars; instead, [35S]methionine incorporation was slightly enhanced with increasing sugar concentration (Fig.  5B, Table 2 ). At 50X sugars, methionine incorporation was strongly inhibited, for unknown reasons. Perhaps uptake of metabolites from the growth medium was inhibited at this sugar concentration. Coomassie blue staining revealed little difference in the amount of T-ag synthesized in cells treated with various sugar concentrations (data not shown). For FHkalactose incorporation, excess unlabeled amino acids had little effect, except for a slight inhibition at the 10X level (Fig. 5A, Table 2 ). Coomassie blue staining revealed a slight reduction in the amount of T-ag immunoprecipitated from cells treated with 10X amino acids (data not shown). In addition, cells treated with higher (50X) levels of amino acids were killed. Thus, it is likely that the slight inhibition of PHJgalactose incorporation observed in the presence of 10X amino acids was due to minor toxicity and reflected a decrease in overall T-ag synthesis. Incorporation of PHlgalactose into T-ag was significantly inhibited in the presence of unlabeled sugars (Fig. 5B) ; 90, 95, 96, and 86% inhibitions were observed for 1X, 5X, 10X, and 50X sugars, respectively (Table 2). These results strongly suggest that T-ag was specifically labeled with PHJgalactose due to glycosylation events, rather than simply due to randomization of the input sugar label.",

Molecular weight markers are shown on the left. the randomization control experiments described above is that [3H14galactose could have been metabolically converted to labeled nucleotides. In fact, galactose can be converted to ribose through the phosphogluconate pathway and could then be incorporated into T-ag as poly-ADP-ribose or RNA oligonucleotides. These products are found in covalent or tight association, respectively, with T-ag (Goldman et a& 1981; Khandjian et oL, 1982) . However, this possibility was precluded by using galactose tritiated in the number 1 position as the input sugar. That carbon and its hydrogens are lost in the early steps of the phosphogluconate pathway before ribose is produced. Thus, nucleotides con-taining ribose generated from D#-~H]galactose would not be radioactive, and labeled T-ag would not be detected as a result of such a conversion.",

This was probably due to nonspecific degradation or some autoproteolytic activity on the part of Tag, as proposed by Seif (1982) . Incubation in the presence of increasing amounts of mixed glycosidases resulted in a small loss of acid-precipitable as radioactivity, probably reflecting contamination of the enzyme preparation with proteases.

Metabolic-labeling experiments revealed that galactose and glucosamine could be incorporated into Tag while mannose and fucose could not. The identity of T-ag was confirmed by its reactivity with a variety of T-ag-specific antisera. It should be noted, however, that T-ag was not strongly labeled with either galactose or glucosamine. Many of our fluorograms required exposure times of l-4 weeks, and those were obtained only after we had optimized the conditions used for infections and labeling. It was crucial to infect cells at a high m.o.i., to prestarve cells with glucose-free medium, and to label with a high concentration of tritiated sugar added in the same medium at the maximal time of T-ag synthesis. In view of these limitations and of the resistance of glycosylated T-ag to treatments with EndoH and TM (see below), the possibility of randomization of input labeled sugar posed a difficult problem in the interpretation of these results. We therefore rigorously explored that possibility.",

First, only two of the four monosaccharides tested were incorporated into T-ag. Mannose, which was not detectably incorporated, can enter glycolysis after conversion to fructose-6-phosphate, and could have generated labeled amino acids through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Lehninger, 1982) . Second, only large Tag was labeled with monosaccharides; small t-ag synthesized in the same cells was not. More direct evidence was obtained by labeling T-ag with THlgalactose in the presence of excess unlabeled amino acids or sugars. Incorporation of the label was clearly inhibited by the presence of unlabeled sugars but was unaffected by the presence of unlabeled amino acids. In addition, treatment of doubly labeled Tag with a mixture of glycosidases resulted in the preferential removal of 3H radioactivity, suggesting that 3H had been incorporated in the original input form of sugar. Finally, we were able to remove and identify the sugar from purified Tag. After acid hydrolysis of [3HJgalactoselabeled T-ag, the major peak of %I radioactivity cochromatographed with carrier galactose. Taken together, these results strongly refute the possibility that T-ag was labeled with monosaccharides only after their metabolic conversion to some other form.",

Another possible explanation could be that only a specific subpopulation of T-ag is glycosylated. However, preliminary experiments from our laboratory suggest that this is not the case; rather, glycosylation appears to be a characteristic of T-ag in general (Jarvis and Butel, unpublished observations) .

EndoH cleaves highmannose N-linked oligosaccharides distal to the linkage sugar, N-acetylglucosamine (Tarentino and Maley, 1974) . TM is known to inhibit the initial glycosylation event in N-linked glycoproteins (Takatsuki et a& 1975) . Thus, these agents would exert their effects on T-ag only if it were an Nlinked glycoprotein. This was possible, since there is a consensus N-glycosylation site (Asn-Arg-Thr; Hunt and Dayhoff, 1970) at amino acid residues 156-158 of T-ag. However, treatment with neither agent changed the electrophoretic mobility of [%]methionine-labeled Tag, even though control experiments verified the efficacy of both treatment protocols. Because inhibition of glycosylation or removal of oligosaccharides might not be accompanied by a detectable change in electrophoretic mobility, TM experiments were also performed using PHfglucosamine-labeled T-ag. No change in the intensity of labeling of T-ag was observed. These results suggest that T-ag is not an N-linked glycoprotein. This is consistent with our inability to label T-ag using mannose, since that sugar is a common constituent of N-linked glycoproteins. Thus, T-ag provides another example of a protein in which a consensus N-glycosylation site is not used, suggesting that the site is necessary, but not sufficient, for Nglycosylation (Hunt and Dayhoff, 1970) .",

            "text": "T-ag is more probably an O-linked gly-coprotein. This interpretation is compatible with the apparent absence of mannose, with EndoH resistance and with TM resistance. It is also compatible with the low level of monosaccharide incorporation, as discussed above, as the oligosaccharide moieties of many O-linked glycoproteins are small. For example, one of the oligosaccharides of the El glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus contains only a single residue each of sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine; the other has only an additional sialic acid residue (Niemann et c& 1984). We have attempted to verify the identification of T-ag as an Olinked glycoprotein by mild alkaline /3elimination (Spiro, 1966) . However, this approach has not been successful because the T-ag polypeptide appears to be degraded under those conditions (0.05M NaOH, 1.0 M NaBH4, 15 hr at 45\"; Jarvis and Butel, unpublished observations). In any case, some controversy exists over the use of this method to distinguish between N-and O-linked glycoproteins (Rasilo and Renkonen, 1981; Ogata and Lloyd, 1982) . A better method would involve treatment of T-ag with acetylgalactosamine oligosaccharidase, which should cleave O-linked oligosaccharides. Unfortunately, this enzyme is no longer commercially available. One of the most interesting characteristics of T-ag is its ability to mediate a large number of different functions in infected and transformed cells (Tooze, 1980; Martin, 1981; Rigby and Lane, 1983) . While it remains difficult to explain its multifunctional nature at a molecular level, the structural characteristics of Tag reveal some intriguing possibilities. One explanation involves the presence of several unique structural domains on the polypeptide, with each domain performing one or more distinct functions. In fact, different T-ag functions have been localized to specific portions of the polypeptide (Rigby and Lane, 1983) . Another possibility emphasizes the localization of T-ag to distinct subcellular compartments in the host cell. Although the majority of T-ag is localized within the nucleus (Pope and Rowe, 1964, Rapp et d, 1964) , small amounts are associated with the plasma membrane (Tevethia et a& 1965; Soule and Butel, 1979; Deppert et aL, 1980; Chandrasekaran et c& 1981; Santos and Butel, 1982; Soule et d, 1982) and mitochondria 19'77) . T-ag species localized within different subcellular compartments might exhibit unique activities, due to putative structural differences and/or the influence of their local environments. A third model invokes the ability of T-ag to form different supramolecular complexes (Prives et a& 1979; McCormick and Harlow, 1980; Fanning et ale, 1981) . These complexes could represent distinct subpopulations of T-ag capable of mediating different functions in the host cell. It is clear that some supramolecular forms exhibit distinct DNA-binding and ATPase properties (Bradley et o& 1982; Fanning et aL, 1982; Gidoni et ok, 1982) . The existence of discrete T-ag subpopulations is also suggested by the finding that certain monoclonal antibodies react with only a subset of the total T-ag present in host cells (Gurney et aL, 1980; Scheller et cd, 1982) .",

            "text": "Thus, the functional diversity of T-ag might be explained by its structural diversity. Structural variability might, in turn, be mediated by combinations of different chemical modifications. Glycosylation could play an important role in generating structurally and functionally discrete forms of T-ag. The study of glycoproteins from other systems has established that glycosylation influences their structure and/or function. For example, N-glycosylation of fibronectin and acetylcholine receptor is crucial to their structural integrity (Olden et al, 1982) . In the absence of glycosylation, those proteins were more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. In another example, the specific nuclear matrix association of certain high mobility group proteins was precluded in the absence of glycosylation (Weintraub et ak, 1983) . This finding is particularly interesting, since some T-ag normally resides in association with the nuclear matrix of host cells (Staufenbiel and Deppert, 1983) . Further, it has been shown that glycosylation is required for the proper supramolecular assembly of thyroid-stimulating hormone (Reeves and Chang, 1983) , suggesting that glycosylation might be important for the supramolecular assembly of T-ag subpopulations.",
