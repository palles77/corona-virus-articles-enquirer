Localization of function in the spinal cord causes a similar pathologic process to result in many different clinical presentations, depending on what part(s) of the spinal cord it affects. For example, a spinal cord mass located at the level of C3 vertebra may result in tetraparesis, whereas the identical mass located at the level of T13 vertebra may result in paraparesis with the thoracic limbs unaffected. Furthermore, localization of function in the spinal cord renders it vulnerable to focal lesions that in other organs where function is more uniformly distributed might not result in detectable clinical signs. For example, a small infarction of the cervical spinal cord may result in tetraplegia, whereas a similar lesion occurring in hepatic parenchyma probably would not compromise liver function.",

The pathologic reactions of the spinal cord to disease are to a degree nonspecific so that with the exception of neoplasia and congenital malformations various disorders may induce a somewhat similar histologic appearance. Clinical syndromes affecting the spinal cord may be characterized by a single focal lesion (transverse myelopathy) or by several focal lesions (multifocal disorders). Certain diseases may have a diffuse (or disseminated) distribution. Myelopathies may be extrinsic, in which spinal cord dysfunction is secondary to diseases of the vertebrae, meninges, or epidural space, or may be intrinsic, in which the disease begins as an intramedullary lesion. Extrinsic myelopathies are almost always transverse myelopathies. As the nervous system can respond in only a limited number of ways to the numerous causes of myelopathies, it is necessary to follow a systematic diagnostic approach in an animal with a spinal cord disorder. Such an approach ensures that less frequently encountered causes of myelopathy are not misdiagnosed and consequently treated inappropriately.",

Fractures usually occur transversely from the intervertebral foramen cranioventrally through the vertebral body or through the vertebral epiphysis in younger animals. Alternatively, the vertebral body may be compressed (compression fracture). Luxations occur through the intervertebral disk space, with the caudal segment or vertebra usually being displaced cranioventrally. Other animals with spinal trauma and significant neurologic deficits have no radiographic evidence of vertebral fractures or luxations. In some of these cases, vertebral displacement may have occurred at the time of trauma, with immediate return to normal alignment. More commonly, perhaps, these cats have spinal cord contusion analogous to that occurring in the brain as a result of trauma. The associated intramedullary hemorrhage and edema may cause myelographic evidence of spinal cord swelling at the site of injury.",

Numerous drugs have been described for the treatment of spinal cord injury, however, the efficacy of these drugs remains controversial. Despite extensive studies the role of dexamethasone in the treatment of traumatic spinal cord injuries remains poorly defined. Due to the frequency of adverse side effects and uncertainty about its efficacy, the use of dexamethasone for treating acute spinal cord injury is not recommended.",

The most important factor in neurologic prognosis is the presence or absence of pain perception. The loss of 'superficial' pain perception occurs with less severe lesions than those resulting in loss of 'deep' pain perception. In general, animals in which any degree of pain perception is detected with certainty can be expected to be restored to locomotion. The more severe the depression of pain perception, the longer the recovery period. In severe injuries, where pain perception has been absent for a brief period, recovery may require months and residual ataxia and paresis may persist. Most animals in which pain perception has been absent for 24 h or more cannot be restored to locomotion, although occasional recoveries have been seen in such cases.",
