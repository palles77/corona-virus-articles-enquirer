JN209931). Despite repeated trials, further sequence fragments could be amplifi ed neither from the specimen from this patient nor from that from the second patient with meningoencephalitis that showed very low virus concentrations (specimen VI1607). From the specimen from the SIDS patient (specimen 347/10), amplifi cation of the complete structural genome and partial nonstructural genome was successful (5,333 nt, GenBank accession no. JN209932). This virus belonged to hCV genotype 2 in the VP1 genomic region (i.e., the region used for the designation of genotypes) (Figure, panel A) . The CSF specimen 07/03981 was also phylogenetically related to genotype 2 viruses in the 5\u2032-UTR and Leader-VP2 genomic regions ( Figure, panels B and C). On the basis of the 5\u2032-UTR sequences, the closest known relative to both viruses was D/VI2229, obtained in Germany in 2004 (nucleotide percentage distance 4.7% for the SIDS specimen and 0.9% for the CSF specimen). In the structural protein gene fragment, the closest relative of both viruses was a strain obtained in the Netherlands in 2008 (Nijmegen2008, nucleotide distance 13.9% for the SIDS specimen and 3.5% for the CSF specimen). This suggested geographic rather than phylogenetic clustering of viruses detected within and beyond the respiratory and enteric tracts. However, formal and fi nal virus typing is pending because VP1 regions could not be sequenced from 2 viruses.",

A low detection rate in CSF does not contradict a general potential of these viruses to cause meningoencephalitis, as exemplifi ed by enteroviruses for which lack of detection in CSF despite clear association with disease is not uncommon (10) . Considering links between the related Theilovirus and demyelinating disease in laboratory models (1) outcomes of patients with hCV infection of the central nervous system should be followed up. Such longitudinal studies should include suffi cient numbers of patients because natural infections with Theilovirus in rodents are common and will less frequently result in multiple sclerosis-like disease than in laboratory models (1) . The rarity of hCV detection in our study suggests the assembly of such cohorts to be a diffi cult and lengthy task that could benefi t greatly from international coordination. Despite the absence of histopathologic alterations, the detection of hCV in a child who died of SIDS is remarkable because the related encephalomyocarditis virus constitutes a prototypic model for myocarditis in mammals (11) . Again, the high human seroprevalence against hCV (12) will complicate epidemiologic studies, yet investigations of links between hCV and SIDS are highly justifi ed because diarrhea is an acknowledged risk factor for SIDS (13) .",

In analogy to enteroviruses and parechoviruses, certain genotypes may be associated with distinct disease profi les, like polioviruses with encephalitis or parechovirus 3 with meningitis (14) . Although we were able to classify the virus detected in the child who died of SIDS as a common genotype 2, the partial hCV sequence from a patient with meningitis did not permit typing because hCVs, as all picornaviruses, recombine frequently (15) . We thus cannot exclude that the viruses detected in the meningitis cases may have acquired distinct features in their capsid protein or elsewhere that might infl uence pathogenicity.",
