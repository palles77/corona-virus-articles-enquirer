The most common cause of acute bronchitis is influenza, with a much smaller percentage of acute bronchitis cases resulting from bacterial infection. Chlamydia pneumoniae has been responsible for several recent outbreaks, particularly in young adults. Bordetella pertussis may cause atypical symptoms resulting in prolonged cases of acute bronchitis in previously immunized adults. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an additional established etiologic agent of acute bronchitis. There is very little evidence that acute bronchitis may be caused by bacterial species that are characteristic of pneumonia infections (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae). Chronic bronchitis most frequently develops in tobacco smokers, approximately 30-50% of whom eventually show symptoms of this disorder Viegi (2001) . Passive exposure to smoke can also contribute to the development of chronic bronchitis. Other causative factors include exposure to indoor or outdoor air pollution, occupational dusts (e.g., grain, coal), or chemical irritants (e.g., sulfur dioxide). Chronic bronchitis may also develop in people with a history of recurrent lung infections or airway hyperresponsiveness Hogg (1999) . Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis are commonly associated with influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, or rhinovirus infections McCrory et al (2001) . Elevated levels of particulate air pollution and ozone are also associated with acute exacerbations. The role of bacterial infection in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis remains controversial. Pathogenic bacterial such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are present in the sputum of approximately half of all those experiencing acute exacerbations but are also frequently present during periods of stable disease Hirschmann (2000) . Clinical trials have shown that antibiotic therapy is helpful in 40% or less of those with acute exacerbations. However, in the subset of exacerbations in which purulent sputum is a predominant feature, the extent of bacterial eradication correlates with the degree of resolution of the exacerbation and its associated inflammation White et al (2003) . Thus, an increase in bacterial load, acquisition of a new bacterial pathogen, or a change in the antigenic makeup of the resident bacterial population, may be responsible for certain acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The role of bacterial infection in the progression of chronic bronchitis is unclear Wilson (1998) .",

Theophylline also inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators by immune cells. Its narrow therapeutic index, potentially life-threatening side effects, and numerous drug interactions have made theophylline a second-line therapy for chronic bronchitis.

It is impossible to predict who will respond to glucocorticoids. Indeed, those who benefit from oral glucocorticoids during acute exacerbations may not realize any value from chronic inhaled glucocorticoid use. Systemic glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisolone) are used for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and can alleviate symptoms, decrease hospitalization time, and reduce relapse rate among steroid-responsive individuals McCrory et al (2001) . Chronic treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids such as fluticasone produces a modest reduction in the incidence of acute exacerbations, with no impact on the rate of functional decline. The United States National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization recommend long-term maintenance therapy with inhaled glucocorticoids in symptomatic patients who exhibit a documented spirometric response to glucocorticoids or who have an FEV-1 of <50% of predicted and suffer from repeated exacerbations requiring antibiotic or glucocorticoid therapy Pauwels et al (2001) .

IL-10 may hold promise in chronic bronchitis as well. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a neutrophil-attracting cytokine that is elevated in the sputum of persons with COP D. Inhibitors of IL-8 and antagonists of its receptor, CXCR2, are being developed and may be useful in the treatment of chronic bronchitis. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that activates various immune cells and stimulates the production of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators. Its levels are elevated in the sputum of individuals with COP D. Monoclonal antibodies directed against TNF-alpha, such as infliximab and recombinant soluble TNFalpha receptor (etanercept) are effective in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory disorders and may be useful in the management of chronic bronchitis. Inhibitors of oxidative stress N-acetylcysteine is a cysteine donor, enhancing the production of the antioxidant glutathione and decreasing oxidative stress. It has been shown to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis Wegner (2001) . Additional antioxidants, such as stable glutathione compounds and superoxide dismutase analogs, are in clinical development. Inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) is responsible for the production of peroxynitrite, a potent oxidative species released during inflammation. Inhibitors of iNOS are under development and may be useful in the treatment of chronic bronchitis.",
