The Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay is a multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR assay that is incorporated with the Luminex tagging system. Following the first release of the Luminex xTAG RVP assay, Luminex Molecular Diagnostics issued a revised version. The new assay have several advantages over the other assays: 1) detect more types of viruses (19 strains); 2) distinguish among influenza A subtypes (H1, H3, 2009 H1N1), coronavirus HKU1, and parainfluenza type 4; 3) handle the largest number of specimens in one run (94 specimens); 4) use a small specimen volume (10 \u03bcL of nucleic acids); and 5) produce semi-quantitative results as the fluorescence intensity.",

All seven specimens showing positive results for coronavirus with the AdvanSure RV assay were also positive with Anyplex II RV16 but were negative with Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2. By contrast, specimens that were positive for metapneumovirus (N = 8) or parainfluenza type 3 (N = 4) with the Ad-vanSure RV assay also showed positive results with Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 but were negative with Anyplex II RV16 (Table 3 ). Table 4 shows the results of each assay for the viral supernatants of various strains. The three kits had comparable performances for most of the tested strains. However, the Anyplex II RV16 assay was unable to detect adenovirus types 12 and 31, while adenovirus type 18 was not detected by the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay. The AdvanSure RV assay missed detecting three types of adenoviruses (31, 40, and 41), and erroneously typed the enterovirus as a rhinovirus (Table 4) .",

Its performance was compared with that of the Anyplex II RV16 assay, and any discrepancies in the results were confirmed by using a third multiplex PCR assay, AdvanSure RV. In general, the Anyplex II RV16 assay detected more pathogens than did the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay, which was not surprising considering that only specimens that showed at least one posi-tive result by the Anyplex II RV16 assay were collected for this comparison. Nonetheless, the Luminex xTAG RVP v2 assay detected more metapneumovirus and parainfluenza type 3 specimens. The xTAG RVP v2 and Anyplex II RV16 assays showed relatively poor concordance for adenovirus, coronavirus NL63, and parainfluenza type 3 specimens. Taking into account the results of the third assay, we found that the Anyplex II RV16 assay detected more adenovirus, bocavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus type A specimens. Moreover, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza type 3, enterovirus, and rhinovirus were more likely to be detected by the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay.",

The discrepancy mainly resulted from the inability to detect ac-companying viruses, mostly adenovirus (13 cases), metapneumovirus (7 cases), and coronavirus NL 63 (6 cases). Among the specimens with three complete sets of assay results, there were slightly more discrepancies for cases of multiple infections than for single-infection cases (26 vs 17).

However, it should be noted that it was challenging to directly compare the detection capabilities of the assays because Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 reports its capabilities in units of copies/mL, whereas the other assays report the results in units of tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50)/ mL. Therefore, laboratory personnel should be aware of the characteristics and differences of the assays they use and should be cautious when performing the assays and reporting the results.

However, the cycle threshold values for the AdvanSure RV assay and the fluorescence intensities for the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assays were highly variable; thus, the discrepant results may be related, at least in part, to the weak positive reactions, although other unexplained factors may also be involved.
