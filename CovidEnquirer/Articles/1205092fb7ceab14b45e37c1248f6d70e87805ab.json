As their remarkable ability to fully regenerate in a scar-free manner, regenerated tissue homogenate of amputated Eisenia fetida (E. fetida) have been considered as an excellent wound repair therapy in our previous study. We have demonstrated that regenerated earthworm (G-90') can perform higher wound repair ability to non-regeneration tissue (G-90) through significant promotion of cutaneous wound repair in mice after their administration into wound beds. Objective: In the present study, we aimed to reveal the mechanism of G-90' and to explore a potential wound healing accelerated strategy. Methods and results: Two functional proteins-HSP70 and lysozyme in G-90\u2032 were confirmed by cross-identification of LC-MS/MS and transcriptome analyses. Followed with semi-quantitative PCR and western blot, their expression were validated to up-regulate in 3-day regenerated tissues (G-90'). Conclusion: This study implies the therapeutic potency of G-90' for wound recovery and provides a new strategy to assess other natural materials targeting wound healing with the tail-amputated E .fetida as a model organism.",

Natural resources provide cost-effective, accessible and reliable medical substances. For instance, in ancient China, disposed earthworms are relied on as home remedies to treat burns, arthritis, itching and inflammation (Zhenjun et al., 1997) . Modern researches also revealed the glycolipoprotein extract from E. fetida, G-90, stimulates cell proliferation and migration promoting wound recovery (Grdisa et al., 2004) . Furthermore, accelerated wound healing process was observed in 3-day post-amputated regeneration section of E. fetida (G-90\u2032) compared to G-90 in our previous study (Yang et al., 2017) . However, the mechanism contributes to augment therapeutic effect in G-90' to G-90 on wound repair is not clear. It was hypothesized as up-regulated expression of specific functional proteins in regeneration process of amputated E. fetida. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate up-regulated materials in regenerated earthworm tissue through several analytic methods. The experimental design is presented in Fig. 1 .",

In addition to functional protein identification, transcriptome analysis was performed to discover differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 3-day regenerated (G-90\u2032) and 0-day regenerated (G-90) tissue homogenate from tail-amputated E. fetida. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a highly sensitive and accurate approach for analysing the whole-transcriptome by using the next generation sequencing technology (Dundar et Yamada et al., 2018) . Due to its incomparable advantages in broader dynamic range, not limitation by prior knowledge and compatibility to all species, RNA-Seq is capable of identifying previously undetected genes even without the reference genome sequences (Thunders et al., 2017) . In this study, we performed RNA-Seq analysis in the absence of a reference genome to discover DEGs in regenerated and non-regenerated E. fetida. Identified functional proteins combined with RNA-Seq analysis in G-90 and G-90', two differentially expressed functional proteins-HSP70 and lysozyme were considered up-regulation after regeneration process. Therefore, their up-regulated expression was validated through semi-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (semi-q PCR) and western blot analysis.",

Sequenced DEGs were translated into proteins through BLAST and annotated by searching in those protein databases. Of the 557 DEGs identified, 337 were annotated between G-90 and G-90'. Proteins annotated in GO, COG and KEGG databases were performed GO enrichment, eggNOG classification and KEGG pathway analyses to investigate biological function of DEGs. As a major bioinformatics, Gene Ontology (GO) aims to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species through three categories-cellular component (CC), molecular function (MF) and biological process (BP). The terms in each of the GO categories were presented in Fig. 4A . This analysis indicates that DEGs are more enriched with terms related to metabolic process, locomotion and biological adhesion in BP, extracellular region, matrix and synapse in CC as well as catalytic activity, transport and antioxidant activity in MF, respectively (Fig. 4A) . Top GO terms of identified DEGs in three categories were presented in Table 4 (p-value < 0.01). Moreover, annotated DEGs in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database were conducted KEGG pathway analysis to better understand the molecular interaction, reaction and relation networks of DEGs in studied organism. As shown in Fig. 4B , there are 50 KEGG pathways included more than 46 annotated DEGs. Of these, 9 KEGG pathways contained genes which tended to be down-regulated, 37 contained genes which tended to be up-regulated and the remaining 4 KEGG pathways contained genes which tended to be differently expressed without regard of direction. Identified DEGs were enormously concentrated in the metabolism, cellular processes and environmental information processing pathways. Among those annotated DEGs, the typically up-regulated gene expression for cathepsins in lysosome pathway and Heat Shock 70 kDa Proteins, the down-regulated expression for collagen and protein kinase A, as well as mix-regulated carbonic anhydrase in nitrogen metabolism were presented in Table 5 . By the combination of LC-MS/MS and RNA-Seq analyses between 3-day (G-90\u2032) and 0-day (G-90) regenerated tissue homogenate of amputated earthworm E. fetida, identified specific proteins HSP70 and lysozyme were speculated to up-regulation in G-90'. Their expression levels were further validated through semi-quantitative PCR analysis and Western Blot.",

To gain further insight into gene alteration of these proteins, RNA-Seq analysis was performed between 3-day (G-90\u2032) and 0-day (G-90) regenerated tissue homogenate. The validation of up-regulated expression of HSP70 and lysozyme in G-90\u2032 were conducted semi-q PCR and Western blot analyses. The DEGs of HSP70 and lysozyme were involved in a range of functions including endocytosis, MAPK signaling pathway, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosome process (Table 5 ). Of the genes tested by semi-q PCR, HSP70 and lysozyme were significantly up-regulated in 3-day (G-90\u2032) and 4-day regenerated tissue of tail-amputated E. fetida respectively compared to 0day regeneration (G-90) ( Fig. 5B and C) . Their down-regulation on 12-h to 1-day post-amputation was speculated by the impaired metabolism. Two expressed proteins in HSP70 family were also found significantly increased after 3-day (G-90\u2032) and 4-day post-amputation ( Fig. 5E and F). The non-detected expression of lysozyme through western blot analysis was considered as the absence of its specific primary antibody to this species. The validation of up-regulated expression of HSP70 and lysozyme in 3-day (G-90\u2032) and 4-day compared to 0-day (G-90) regenerated tissue illustrated that some functional proteins identified in G-90' was triggered expression after amputation process and these proteins may also explain regeneration mechanism of amputated earthworms.",

Coupled with RNA-Sequencing approach between G-90 and G-90', 557 DEGs were detected with 469 up-regulated and 88 down-regulated genes. After functional annotation and KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs, several extraordinary annotated proteins were selected including HSP70s, cathepsins and carbonic anhydrase correlated with pathway of endocytosis, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum as well as lysosome (Table 5) . By the combination of LC-MS/MS and transcriptome analytic results, proteins-HSP70 and lysozyme were successfully determined as up-regulation in regeneration process. Further validation of their expression patterns after tail-amputation was conducted with semi-q RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Referring to the protocol by Maria Marone et al., semi-q RT-PCR was performed to assess mRNA expression levels of HSP70 and lysozyme on different regeneration time of amputated E. fetida (Marone et al., 2001) . A decreased mRNA levels in both HSP70 and lysozyme was detected after amputation for 12 h to 1 day, while their expression progressed incrementally in regenerated wound tissues and reached a high level after 3-4 days regeneration. The explanation for the sharply reduced mRNA levels may be the impaired metabolism after tail-amputation. Therefore, enzymatic reactions including DNA transcription, translation and RNA expression processes were delayed for the absence of timely energetic supply. The cross-reaction of HSC73 and HSP72 in HSP70 family may due to the highly homogenous recognition site for purchased HSP70 Rabbit Polyclonal primary antibody. This phenomenon also demonstrated by Barbara S. Polla et al. (Polla et al., 2007) . In this study, up-regulated expression of HSP70s occurred after 3-4 days of regeneration in amputated E. fetida. However, lysozyme was not successfully detected presumably due to the low specific binding between protein and its antibody.",

            "text": "Although this is the first research to discuss HSP70 and lysozyme in regeneration process of tail-amputated E. fetida, their functional roles have been ubiquitous elucidated in other species. Lysozyme is widely distributed in nature from eukaryotes to prokaryotes (Joll\u00e8s, 1996; Prager and Jolles, 1996; Van Herreweghe and Michiels, 2012; Goto et al., 2007; Beintema and Terwisscha van Scheltinga, 1996; Callewaert and Michiels, 2010) . Because of their original source, catalytic character and structure, lysozymes are divided into six groups, in which earthworm derived lysozyme belongs to invertebrate-type lysozyme (itype lysozyme) (Joskova et al., 2009; Zavalova et al., 2000) . Radka Joskova et al. successfully expressed recombinant Eisenia andrei lysozyme by using Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and characterised it in innate defence system with lysozyme, isopeptidase, as well as antibacterial activities (Bachali et al., 2002) . As to heat shock proteins (HSPs), they are generally grouped into six major families based on molecular weight, including HSP100, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, HSP40 and the small Heat Shock Protein family (Vos et al., 2008) . Among them, HSP70 are the most studied HSPs due to its ubiquitous and highly conserved in all organisms (Feder and Hofmann, 1999; Morimoto, 1998 and HSP72 is induced by stress conditions (Daugaard et al., 2007) . Consistent with these analyses, we discovered their up-regulated expression in 3-4 days of regeneration of tail-amputated E. fetida by the cross-validation of semi-q PCR and western blot methods. Up-regulation of these proteins in earthworm regeneration period suggests their wound healing ability and reveals accelerated wound recovery mechanism for G-90\u2032 compared to G-90 in previous study. Earthworms are widely used as indicator organism in ecotoxicological studies to investigate the soil environmental quality for it hypersensitive to toxic chemicals (Brulle et al., 2006; OECD, 1984; Ji et al., 2014) . For instance, RNA-Seq analysis was performed in juvenile and adult E. fetida to analyze the impact of toxin exposure on genome wide gene expression (Thunders et al., 2017) . In this study, the detection of two up-regulated proteins in regeneration process of tail-amputated E. fetida can provide a new strategy to assess potential natural materials targeting wound healing. With the tail-amputated E. fetida as wound healing model organism, HSP70 and lysozyme as biomarkers and established analytic method, the unique value of this worldwide distributed species should be deeply explored. In summary, we identified two wound healing specific proteins-HSP70 and lysozyme in 3-day regenerated earthworm tissue (G-90\u2032) by the cross-identification with LC-MS/MS and RNA-Seq analyses. Moreover, their up-regulated expression patterns in G-90\u2032 to G-90 were validated using semi-q PCR and western blot approaches. This reveals the mechanism for accelerated wound repair in mice occurred after the administration of G-90\u2032 into wound beds compared to G-90 because of HSP70 and lysozyme up-regulation (Yang et al., 2017) . This study indicated the therapeutic potential of G-90' on wound recovery and provide a new strategy to assess other natural materials targeting wound healing with the tail-amputated E. fetida as wound healing model organism.",

Furthermore, the experimental methods of HSP70 and lysozyme through semi-q PCR and western blot, provide a new strategy to assess other natural materials targeting wound healing with the tail-amputated E. fetida as wound healing model organism. 5 . The validation of up-regulated expression of HSP70 and lysozyme through Semi-q PCR and Western blot analyses. (A, B, and C) Cropped images of semi-q PCR products analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Relative quantification of PCR products using \u03b2-actin as a reference gene displayed a significant up-regulation of HSP70 and lysozyme in 3-day and 4-day regenerated tissue of tail-amputated E. fetida compared to 0-day regeneration. (D, E, and F) Cropped images of Western blot analysis showing the detected bands of targeted proteins. Relative quantification of western blot using \u03b2-actin as a reference protein showed a significant up-regulation of HSP70s in 3-day and 4-day regenerated tissue of tailamputated E. fetida compared to 0-day regeneration.
