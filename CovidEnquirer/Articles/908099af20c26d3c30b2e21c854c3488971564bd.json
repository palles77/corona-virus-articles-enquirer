Furosemide, enalapril, pimobendan, and mexiletine were prescribed, and a Holter was scheduled after resolution of congestive heart failure. Three days later, the dog died suddenly during sleep. Histopathology revealed diffuse myocyte hypertrophy with multifocal hemorrhages, alternating to areas of severe replacement fibrosis and lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates. Immunohystochemistry stains were strongly positive for T-lymphocyte infiltration (CD3) and weakly positive for B-lymphocytes (CD79). Polymerase chain reaction was positive for Bartonella spp. Based on these results, a post-mortem diagnosis of bacterial inflammatory cardiomyopathy was made. \u00aa",

The acute phase of myocarditis takes only a few days: viral entry and replication induces acute injury to the myocytes, leading to myocyte necrosis; subsequent exposure of intracellular antigens is followed by activation of the host's immune system, which is characterized by the invasion of natural killer cells and macrophages, followed by T-lymphocytes [3] . The subacute phase of myocarditis, which may occur a few weeks to several months after the initial infection, is characterized by myocardial inflammation mediated by the effector cells of the immune system (cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages), by loco-regional effect of inflammatory mediators released by the infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages or endothelial cells, and by direct interaction of the antibodies against myocardial cells [3, 7] . The chronic phase of myocarditis is then characterized by multifocal myocardial replacement fibrosis, systolic dysfunction, and development of a DCM with segmental dyskinesis (i.e. inflammatory cardiomyopathy DCM) [3] .",
