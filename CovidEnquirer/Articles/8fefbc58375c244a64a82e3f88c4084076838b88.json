            "text": "Many viruses alter intracellular calcium homeostasis. The rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane glycoprotein, increases intracellular levels of cytoplasmic Ca 2\u0609 ([Ca 2\u0609 ]cyto) through a phospholipase C-independent pathway, which is required for virus replication and morphogenesis. However, the NSP4 domain and mechanism that increases [Ca 2\u0609 ]cyto are unknown. We identified an NSP4 domain (amino acids [aa] 47 to 90) that inserts into membranes and has structural characteristics of viroporins, a class of small hydrophobic viral proteins that disrupt membrane integrity and ion homeostasis to facilitate virus entry, assembly, or release. Mutational analysis showed that NSP4 viroporin activity was mediated by an amphipathic \u2423-helical domain downstream of a conserved lysine cluster. The lysine cluster directed integral membrane insertion of the viroporin domain and was critical for viroporin activity. In epithelial cells, expression of wild-type NSP4 increased the levels of free cytoplasmic Ca 2\u0609 by 3.7-fold, but NSP4 viroporin mutants maintained low levels of [Ca 2\u0609 ]cyto, were retained in the ER, and failed to form cytoplasmic vesicular structures, called puncta, which surround viral replication and assembly sites in rotavirus-infected cells. When [Ca 2\u0609 ]cyto was increased pharmacologically with thapsigargin, viroporin mutants formed puncta, showing that elevation of calcium levels and puncta formation are distinct functions of NSP4 and indicating that NSP4 directly or indirectly responds to elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels. NSP4 viroporin activity establishes the mechanism for NSP4-mediated elevation of [Ca 2\u0609 ]cyto, a critical event that regulates rotavirus replication and virion assembly.",

One goal of these studies was to identify the NSP4 domain that induces ER calcium permeability and the PLC-independent elevation of [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto. Previously, an ER-proximal polybasic domain (amino acids [aa] 48 to 91) was shown to permeabilize both mammalian and Escherichia coli membranes (29, 30) . In BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli, NSP4 expression disrupts inner membrane integrity, leading to T7 lysozymemediated cell lysis (29) . Since other viroporins cause lysis in this assay (31) (32) (33) , we hypothesized that this domain of NSP4 functioned as a viroporin. We analyzed NSP4 for the following structural motifs common to viroporins: oligomerization domains, lysine-or arginine-rich basic regions, and amphipathic \u2423-helices (6, 16) . Previous studies showed that NSP4 oligomerizes through a coiled-coil domain (CCD; aa 95 to 137) (34) . Next, based on the helical propensity of NSP4 aa 48 to 91 (NSP4 ), helical wheel models of the simian agent 11 (SA11) NSP4 putative viroporin domain were generated. The N-terminal helix is predicted to be amphipathic and contains a cluster of lysine residues on one face of the helix. The C-terminal helix is also predicted to be amphipathic, with distinct polar and nonpolar surfaces (Fig. 1A) . These subdomains were named the pentalysine domain (PD) and amphipathic domain (AD).",

            "text": "To determine if the PD, AD, and CCD were necessary for membrane permeabilization, SA11 NSP4 truncation and deletion constructs were tested for membrane-destabilizing activity (MDA) using the bacterial lysis assay (Fig. 1B) . In the absence of IPTG (isopropyl-\u2424-D-thiogalactopyranoside), bacteria bearing an NSP4 47-146 expression vector continued to grow (Fig. 1C , black line), but induction of NSP4 expression led to rapid cell lysis (red line). Cell lysis was not directly caused by NSP4 because the optical density of BL21(DE3) E. coli (lacking lysozyme) expressing NSP4 47-146 remained stable (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Expression of NSP4 , which includes only the PD and AD, slowed the kinetics but not the extent of cell lysis (Fig. 1C , orange line). Deletion of the PD had no effect on MDA (Fig. 1C , blue line), but deletion of the AD abrogated lysis (green line). Immunoblot analysis showed that all four constructs were expressed, though detection of NSP4 47-90 required that 5-fold more cell lysate had to be analyzed, reflecting a lower level of expression (Fig. 1D ). The MDA of NSP4 suggested that the putative viroporin domain could oligomerize independently of the CCD. To test this, partially purified NSP4 47-90 was analyzed by immunoblotting following reducing or nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 1E ). In the absence of \u2424-mercaptoethanol (BME), the major species detected had the fastest-migrating band of~18 kDa, and slower-migrating species were also detected, with their molecular masses increasing in~12-kDa increments. In the presence of BME, the fastest-migrating band was~10 kDa, and slower-migrating species increased in molecular masses of~6-kDa increments. These data indicate that NSP4 47-90 forms disulfide-stabilized dimers that further oligomerize into higher-molecular-weight species that are stabilized by the lipidmimetic SDS in the running buffer. The putative viroporin domain contains two conserved cysteine residues (Fig. 1A , arrowheads) that could support disulfide bond formation, and SDS-stabilized oligomers have been observed for other viroporins (35) (36) (37) . Together, these data show that the viroporin domain oligomerizes independently of the CCD and is sufficient for NSP4 MDA and that this activity is mediated by the AD amphipathic \u2423-helix.",

The above-described results suggested that the PD is dispensable for MDA when this domain is deleted from NSP4, leaving the AD with a free amino terminus. However, clustered lysine residues are important for the activity of other viroporins (38, 39) , so we next sought to determine whether the five clustered lysine residues were important for NSP4 MDA in the context of the full viroporin domain. First, using site-directed mutagenesis, all five positively charged lysine residues (aa 55, 59, 62, 66, and 69) in the SA11 NSP4 47-146 truncation were replaced by glutamic acid, a negatively charged residue that would not disrupt the helical propensity. This mutation blocked MDA, indicating that one or more lysine residues were crucial for NSP4-mediated membrane disruption (data not shown). To determine which lysine residues were important, each lysine was replaced by glutamic acid individually or in combinations of two or three within the context of SA11 NSP4 . This slightly shorter construct was used to make the generation of multiple mutations easier, and no Lysine-to-glutamic acid mutants were tested in the E. coli lysis assay. The OD 600 of uninduced (\u03eaIPTG, black line) or NSP4-expressing cultures was determined at 10-min intervals for 90 minutes and presented as the percent optical density relative to the optical density at the time of induction. (Bottom) Immunoblot of NSP4 expression using monoclonal antibody B4-2/55. (B, top) Lysine-to-alanine and lysine-to-histidine mutants were tested in the E. coli lysis assay, as described above. (Bottom) Immunoblot of NSP4 expression using monoclonal antibody B4-2/55. difference in the rate or extent of bacterial cell lysis was observed between NSP4 47-146 and NSP4 (compare red lines of Fig. 1C and 2A). The MDA of wild-type (WT) NSP4 54-146 (red line) was equivalent to that of the single lysine-to-glutamic acid mutant K69E ( Fig. 2A , orange line) and the other single mutants (data not shown). Double or triple mutations of any combination of K55, K59, and K62 to glutamic acid also showed wild-type MDA (data not shown). Double or triple mutations of any combination of K62, K66, and K69 to glutamic acid (K62,66,69E) reduced NSP4 54-146 MDA ( Fig. 2A) , with the triple K62,66,69E mutation (gray line) showing continued growth similar to that of the uninduced negative control. Immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates showed expression of each mutant ( Fig. 2A, bottom) . These data indicate that the C-terminal lysine res-idues (aa 62, 66, and 69) within the PD were important for NSP4 MDA.",

Thus, disruption of NSP4 AD amphipathicity would be predicted to abolish MDA. To test this prediction, a six-residue mutant was constructed that changed aa 75 to 80 from IFNTLL to ASDASA and substantially decreased the amphipathic moment of the AD (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). As expected, the ASDASA mutant had no MDA (Fig. 3A , gray line). To identify residues on the polar and nonpolar sides of the AD crucial for MDA, we made point mutations in the context of SA11 NSP4 . Residues on the nonpolar side were replaced by either serine or asparagine (small polar residues), whereas residues on the polar side were replaced by either alanine or leucine (small and large nonpolar residues). The MDA of the AD mutants clustered into the following three groups: wild-type MDA (C71S, F76S, N77A, T78A, L80S, K81L, and N77A T78A) ( The importance of \u2423-helical secondary structure was investigated by inserting a proline-glycine dipeptide (PG) at various places within the PD or AD (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) within the NSP4 54-146 construct. Since PG disrupts helices, if the structure at the site of insertion is important, then the MDA would be reduced. PG insertion after lysine 59, which is not important for MDA, had wild-type MDA (see Fig. S3 , orange line, in the supplemental material). PG insertion after residues 62 or 67 reduced the rate, but not the extent, of MDA (see Fig. S3 , green and blue lines). PG insertion after residues 71 and 76 (within the AD) significantly impaired and abolished MDA, respectively (see Fig. S3 , dark blue and gray lines, respectively). Thus, the propensity of the viroporin domain to form a helical structure is important, though to differing degrees depending on the location.",

Since the optical density of cells lacking lysozyme upon induction of NSP4 47-146 expression remained unchanged (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), NSP4 expression may cause cell death in the absence of cell lysis. To determine if wild-type or mutant NSP4 proteins decreased cell viability, the number of CFU/milliliter plated in the absence or presence of 1 mM IPTG was determined (Fig. 4) . Wild-type NSP4 95-146 , which lacks the viroporin domain, was used as the negative control and showed a decrease of only 2 \u03eb 10 8 CFU/ml. In contrast, the viability of wild-type NSP4 54-146 -expressing cells dropped by 7 \u03eb 10 8 CFU/ml, a \u03fe99% decrease. The NTK mutant had a similar drop in cell viability, but expression of the K62,66,69E, F76S L79S, and ASDASA mutants showed a significantly attenuated loss of viability. Thus, these data show that NSP4 itself is cytotoxic to bacteria without causing cell lysis, and the putative viroporin domain is the primary mediator of this cytotoxicity.",

Based upon the structure of the 2B viroporin, the NSP4 viroporin domain would be predicted to form a two-helix transmembrane hairpin. However, this predicted structure conflicts with the accepted topology of full-length NSP4, wherein aa 25 to 44 is an ER signal sequence that directs transmembrane insertion, and the viroporin domain is peripherally associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane (42) . Thus, we sought to determine if, in the absence of the transmembrane domain encompassing aa 25 to 44, the viroporin domain is peripherally associated with membranes, as predicted by the current topology model, or inserted through membranes, as would be expected if NSP4 is a viroporin. A series of truncations (Fig. 5A ) that contain both the viroporin domain and the soluble CCD (NSP4 ), only the viroporin domain (NSP4 ), or only the CCD (NSP4 95-146 ), a soluble tetrameric coiled-coil domain (43) , were expressed in bacteria. The cells were separated into soluble, peripheral, or integral membrane fractions and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5B ). Both NSP4 and NSP4 were found solely in the integral membrane protein fraction, but NSP4 95-146 was found predominantly in the soluble fraction, indicating the viroporin domain directed membrane insertion of the NSP4 47-146 and NSP4 truncations.",

As before, wild-type NSP4 was found entirely in the integral membrane fraction, as was the ASDASA mutant. The K55,59,62,66,69E mutant migrated slightly faster due to a greater net negative charge and was found primarily in the peripheral membrane protein fraction, with a minor amount detected in the integral membrane fraction. Thus, while disruption of both the positive charge of the PD and the amphipathic organization of the AD blocked NSP4 MDA, only disruption of the positive charge prevented transmembrane insertion of the viroporin domain.

WT NSP4-EGFP was expressed, and endo-\u2424-Nacetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) treatment, to remove N-linked carbohydrates, increased NSP4 migration, indicating that it was glycosylated (Fig. 5D ). Both the NTK and ASDASA mutants were expressed and glycosylated similarly to WT NSP4 (NTK data not shown). K62,66,69E was barely detectable by immunoblotting, migrated similarly to unglycosylated NSP4, and was not susceptible to endo H treatment; however, treatment with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 (50 M) increased levels of nonglycosylated K62,66,69E (Fig. 5D) , suggesting that it might be targeted for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) (44) . These data were confirmed by flow cytometry, as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for K62,66,69E was significantly lower than that of the WT and increased 288% with MG132 treatment (Fig. 5E ). To ensure that K62,66,69E was still membrane associated, we sepa- rated cells into soluble, peripheral, and integral membrane fractions, marked by immunoblot detection of GFP, GM130, and STIM-1, respectively (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). In the absence of MG132, the WT and ASDASA were detected exclusively in the integral membrane fraction. In the presence of MG132, K62,66,69E was found primarily in the integral membrane fraction, but some protein was detected in the soluble and peripheral membrane protein fractions (Fig. 5F ). Together, these data suggest that NSP4 is initially targeted to the ER membrane via the noncleaved signal sequence (aa 28 to 44), but the lysine cluster directed translocation of the viroporin domain (aa 47 to 90) into the membrane. Altering the charge of the lysine cluster blocked membrane insertion of the viroporin domain in E. coli and targeted NSP4 for ERAD-mediated degradation in mammalian cells. Thus, the lysines facilitate proper NSP4 folding by directing viroporin domain insertion into the membrane.",

Intracellular expression of fulllength NSP4 in eukaryotic cells leads to increased ER permeability and a significant increase in [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto (26, 28) . We tested the mutants characterized using the E. coli lysis assay to determine if the viroporin domain is responsible for the increased [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto using the fluorescent calcium indicator Indo-1. Using flow cytometry, we measured the mean [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto of cells expressing EGFP, the WT, or viroporin mutant NSP4-EGFP (Fig. 6) . Expression of WT NSP4-EGFP increased the ratio of calcium-bound to calcium-free Indo-1 fluorescence, shifting the EGFP-positive population to the right (Fig. 6A, blue) , but histograms for cells expressing NSP4-EGFP K62,66,69E or ASDASA remained clustered to the left (Fig. 6A , red and green, respectively). Cytoplasmic calcium levels (Fig. 5B) ]cyto causes rapid formation of the puncta, and in rotavirus-infected cells, NSP4 colocalizes with LC3 in these puncta that surround viroplasms, cytoplasmic inclusions where genome replication and progeny virus assembly occur (45) . Thus, assessment of NSP4 puncta formation acts as a surrogate for testing the ability of viroporin mutants to form the viroplasm-associated puncta. The subcellular localization and distribution of WT or mutant NSP4-EGFP fusion proteins were analyzed in normal medium (1.8 mM CaCl 2 ), which supports spontaneous puncta formation for wildtype NSP4. The extent of ER localization for EGFP, WT NSP4- EGFP, and the three NSP4-EGFP viroporin mutants (K62,66,69E, NTK, and ASDASA) was determined by colocalization with an ER-targeted DsRed2 fluorescent protein using confocal microscopy (Fig. 7A) . EGFP was found throughout the cell and did not localize to the ER or form puncta (Fig. 7A, first row) . As seen previously, WT NSP4-EGFP localized partially to the ER compartment and to distinct puncta that did not contain the DsRed-ER marker (Fig. 7A, second row) . In contrast, NSP4-EGFP viroporin mutants were localized primarily in the ER, with cells expressing K62,66,69E and ASDASA lacking puncta (Fig. 7A , third and fifth rows, respectively), with a few small discrete puncta that did not contain DsRed-ER being observed in cells expressing NTK.",

This experiment was designed to determine if BAPTA treatment to buffer the elevated [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto caused by the viroporin activity of WT NSP4 would decrease puncta formation and if TG treatment to pharmacologically elevate [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto would induce puncta formation of NSP4 viroporin-deficient mutants. In normal DMEM, WT NSP4-EGFP formed discrete puncta in 93.3% of cells, but the viroporin mutants formed significantly fewer puncta, with rates of 9.4% for K62,66,69E, 55.5% for NTK, and 10.7% for ASDASA (Fig. 7B , black bars) (P \u03fd 0.01). BAPTA-AM treatment of WT NSP4-EGFP-expressing cells reduced puncta formation to 53.7% (Fig. 7B) (P \u03fd 0.01 ). An overall decrease in the number of punctacontaining cells was also observed in BAPTA-treated viroporin mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 7B ) (P of \u03fd0.01 for NTK and AS-DASA). Finally, cytoplasmic calcium levels were elevated pharmacologically with TG to determine if exogenous calcium stimulation would induce puncta formation of the viroporin NSP4-EGFP mutants. TG treatment did not significantly increase the number of puncta-containing WT NSP4-EGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 7B) . In contrast, TG treatment increased puncta formation by 28.4% for K62,66,69E, 25.7% for NTK, and 39.5% for ASDASA (Fig. 7B,  light gray) . Thus, mutation of the viroporin domain decreased spontaneous puncta formation; however, pharmacological elevation of [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto induced puncta formation of the mutant proteins. Together, these data show (i) that the viroporin mutants were specifically deficient in the elevation of [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto but not in the ability to form puncta, (ii) that elevated [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto triggers the trafficking of NSP4 out of the ER and into cytoplasmic puncta, and (iii) that elevation of [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto and formation of puncta are separable steps within this process.",

The AD also plays a role in NSP4 oligomerization by promoting the formation of high-molecular-weight NSP4 multimers that were lost by disrupting this domain (46) . We confirmed this observation, since expression of the viroporin domain alone (aa 47 to 90) had viroporin activity and formed disulfide-bonded dimers and SDS-stable oligomers (Fig. 1E) , which have been seen with other viroporins (35, 36) . Therefore, oligomerization of the viroporin domain can occur in the absence of the CCD. Though direct evidence that this domain forms a pore is needed, this can be demonstrated only by an atomic structure of NSP4, which is hampered by the necessity to use detergent to extract NSP4 during purification.",

These data support a new topology model for NSP4, where transmembrane insertion of the viroporin domain leads to a 3-pass trans-membrane topology (Fig. 8) . The NSP4 viroporin domain likely forms a two-helix hairpin, similar to that of HCV p7, because the C terminus is known to be exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane and functions as an intracellular receptor for immature virions (8, 47) . Oligomerization of NSP4 around the amphipathic \u2423-helix would then create an aqueous channel through which Ca 2\u03e9 could pass. This new model incorporates and is consistent with two early studies of NSP4 topology that identified either aa 25 to 44 or aa 67 to 85 as being the single transmembrane segment (42, 48) .",

The formation of these vesicular puncta by exogenous expression of NSP4 serves as a surrogate for the formation of viroplasm-associated puncta. In these studies, mutation of the viroporin domain prevented the elevation of cytoplasmic Ca 2\u03e9 levels, which correlated with the disruption of viroporin activity and loss of E. coli cytotoxicity. While the NTK mutant did not induce lysozyme-mediated cell lysis, it showed E. coli cytotoxicity and elevation of calcium levels similar to those of WT NSP4, indicating that MDA can be retained in the absence of cell lysis. The use of flow cytometry and Indo-1 as a Ca 2\u03e9 indicator allowed singlecell analysis of a much larger population of NSP4-expressing cells than in previous studies that used single-cell microscopy and Fura-2 (27, 28) . Additionally, Indo-1 is less sensitive to compartmentalization into Ca 2\u03e9 -storage organelles, allowing more accurate measurements of [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto (52) .",

Additionally, expression of NSP4 increases plasma membrane permeability to mono-and divalent cations (28) . Since NSP4 traffics to the plasma membrane in RV-infected cells, it is possible that NSP4 viroporin activity could directly increase plasma membrane permeability to Ca 2\u03e9 and possibly other ions (28, 54) . Both mechanisms rely on NSP4 viroporin activity; however, a detailed analysis of how NSP4 affects Ca 2\u03e9 at both the ER and plasma membrane will be necessary to determine the relative importance that either direct permeabilization or SOCE activation, or both, has on the elevation of intracellular Ca 2\u03e9 levels during a rotavirus infection.",

We demonstrated that failure of the viroporin mutants to spontaneously form puncta was a direct consequence of their inability to elevate cytoplasmic Ca 2\u03e9 levels by measuring puncta formation after buffering (BAPTA-AM) or elevating (TG) [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto. Under normal conditions, puncta formation by NSP4 occurs spontaneously and rapidly; however, mutants of either the pentalysine domain (K62,66,69E) or amphipathic domain (ASDASA) were unable to form puncta. TG stimulation of viroporin mutant NSP4 puncta formation demonstrated that the mutations specifically blocked the elevation of [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto but not the ability to form puncta. Thus, disruption of cellular Ca 2\u03e9 homeostasis and puncta formation are separable events, and NSP4 not only increases [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto by viroporin activity but also appears to be a sensor for changes in [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto. The NSP4 viroporin mutants developed in these studies will be useful tools to determine the precise [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto that triggers NSP4 puncta formation.",

First, elevation of cytoplasmic Ca 2\u03e9 levels regulates the formation of viroplasms, the RV replication complex. Nonstructural protein 5 (NSP5), a component of viroplasms, has two pseudo-EF-hand Ca 2\u03e9 binding sites and elevated levels of cytoplasmic Ca 2\u03e9 , and Ca 2\u03e9 binding triggers the aggregation of soluble NSP5 into a viroplasm-like structure (55) . Second, in response to elevated levels of Ca 2\u03e9 , NSP4 traffics out of the ER and into puncta that surround viroplasms. Third, the assembly of the RV outer capsid protein VP7 onto virions requires high Ca 2\u03e9 levels inside the ER (24) . Since RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of NSP4 prevents the proper assembly of viroplasms and causes the mislocalization of several other RV proteins (56, 57) , it appears that NSP4 viroporin activity functionally regulates the progression of RV infection and assembly by altering the cytoplasmic Ca 2\u03e9 levels.",

At approximately 28 h posttransfection, the cells were gently washed with HBSS-BSA, and Indo-1 loading buffer was added for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in alpha-MEM (no phenol red) plus 10% FBS plus 10 mM HEPES, and maintained at 37\u00b0C until analyzed. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using an LSRII system running FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Indo-1 fluorescence was excited by a UV laser (355 nm), and Ca 2\u03e9 -free and Ca 2\u03e9 -bound emissions were split using a 505LP dichroic filter. Ca 2\u03e9 -free emission was collected with a 525/50-nm band-pass filter, and the Ca 2\u03e9 -bound emission was collected with a 405/20-nm band-pass filter. EGFP fluorescence was excited by the argon laser (488 nm), and emission was collected with a 520/20-nm band-pass filter. The mean bound Ca 2\u03e9 -to-free Ca 2\u03e9 fluorescence ratio (R) was determined for each sample. The concentration of calcium was calculated by using the following equation: Ca 2\u03e9 (nM) \u03edK d (R \u03ea R min )S f2 /(R max \u03ea R)S b2 . Treatment of cells with 10 mM EDTA and 5 M ionomycin was used to determine the fluorescence ratios at zero (R min ) and saturated (R max ) calcium, respectively. S f2 and S b2 are the fluorescence intensities of the calcium-free and -bound dyes, respectively. The dissociation constant of Indo-1 is 250 nM. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and results are presented at the mean calculated calcium level.",

Single mutation of F76S had wild-type MDA (Fig. 3A, green line), but the F76S L79S double mutant had no MDA (Fig. 3A, purple line). Thus, the combined F76S L79S mutation exerted a synergistic blocking effect on membrane permeabilization. No single mutation of polar face residues abolished MDA. Mutants T78L(Fig. 3B, purple line) and K81A (light blue line) showed impaired activity, though protein expression of T78L was slightly delayed(Fig. 3B, bottom). Mutation K81A impaired NSP4 MDA(Fig. 3B, purple line), but mutation K81L (dark blue line) had wildtype MDA, indicating that residue choice affected the observed MDA. Finally, the triple-leucine mutation N77L T78L K81L (NTK) abolished MDA, again showing that multiple mutations have synergistic blocking effects(Fig. 3B, gray line).

NTK viroporin mutant-expressing cells have a similar elevation in free calcium levels (111.6 \u03ee 22.9 nM), but cells expressing the K62,66,69E or ASDASA viroporin mutants had significantly lower levels of free calcium (40.0 \u03ee 4.0 nM and 47.4 \u03ee 5.0 nM, respectively) than cells expressing WT NSP4-EGFP (P \u03fd 0.05). Together, these data show that the NSP4 viroporin domain is responsible for elevating [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto, and mutations that abrogated MDA and E. coli cytotoxicity correlated with the inability to elevate [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto. NSP4 viroporin mutants are ER localized and require exogenous calcium stimulation to form vesicular puncta. Previous studies demonstrated that three pools of NSP4 exist within mammalian cells that localize to the (i) rough ER, (ii) ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and (iii) puncta containing the autophagy marker LC3. NSP4 puncta formation is calcium dependent, such that NSP4 is localized to the ER if [Ca 2\u03e9 ]cyto remains low but an increase in the [Ca 2\u03e9",
