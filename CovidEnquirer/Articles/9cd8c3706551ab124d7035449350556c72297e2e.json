In a screen based on a yeast three-hybrid system using the 5 0 -untranslated region (5 0 -UTR) of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA as bait against a human cDNA library derived from HeLa cells, we found a positive candidate cellular protein, zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA-binding motif 1 (MADP1), to be able to interact with this region of the SARS-CoV genome. This interaction was subsequently confirmed in coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The specificity of the interaction between MADP1 and the 5 0 -UTR of IBV was investigated and confirmed by using an RNA pull-down assay. The RNA-binding domain was mapped to the N-terminal region of MADP1 and the protein binding sequence to stem-loop I of IBV 5 0 -UTR. MADP1 was found to be translocated to the cytoplasm and partially co-localized with the viral replicase/transcriptase complexes (RTCs) in IBVinfected cells, deviating from its usual nuclear localization in a normal cell using indirect immunofluorescence. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) against MADP1, defective viral RNA synthesis was observed in the knockdown cells, therefore indicating the importance of the protein in coronaviral RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "During the replication of mammalian viruses, it is inevitable for host proteins to be involved in the viral life cycles. In fact, coronaviruses require host proteins to aid in the stages from virus entry to progeny release. Entry of the virus particle into a host cell requires the recognition of specific cell surface proteins, which act as receptors for the virus spike (S) protein (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Upon entry into host cells, the ribonucleocapsid uncoats and releases the 5 0 -capped viral genome, a single-stranded positive-sense RNA. The genomic RNA ranges from 27 to 32 kb in length, is the largest known of its kind and is structurally similar to host mRNA (7) . The replicase gene, which spans the 5 0 two-thirds of the genome, is translated by host ribosomes into two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab via a frameshift event (8) (9) (10) . The polyproteins are autoproteolytically processed into a maximum of 16 nonstructural proteins (8, (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) , which are assembled into replicationtranscription complexes, including the main enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) (17, 18) . This complex is required for generating new full-length virus RNA in replication as well as subgenome-length RNAs to be used for translation of virus structural and accessory proteins. In addition to their role in RNA synthesis, these nonstructural proteins may have multiple functions, such as the suppression of host mRNA translation as well as mRNA degradation by nsp1 of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV; [19] [20] [21] , which may play a role in the suppression of immune response mounted by the host upon infection.",

Subsequently, the RNA-binding domain of MADP1 and the RNA secondary structure responsible for the interaction were mapped and defined. Using indirect immunofluorescence, we confirmed that MADP1, despite being reported as a nuclear protein (35) , was detected in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells and partially co-localized with the RTCs. Upon silencing of MADP1 using siRNA, viral RNA synthesis on general has been affected, resulting in a lower replication efficiency and infectivity.",

IBV replication and transcription, on the other hand, take place in the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Therefore, to validate the likelihood of MADP1 interacting with the viral 5 0 -UTR, immunofluorescence was used to track the subcellular localization of both Flag-tagged MADP1 and de novo synthesized viral RNA in both mock-infected and IBV-infected cells. Flag-tagged MADP1 was overexpressed in cultured Vero cells, which were then infected with IBV and treated with actinomycin D to inhibit host transcription. The newly synthesized viral RNA, a marker for the RTCs, was labeled with BrUTP. The cells were fixed at 10 h post-infection to allow sufficient labeling of the newly synthesized viral RNA and to minimize the formation of large syncytial cells. In uninfected cells, Flag-tagged MADP1 was localized in the nucleus exclusively ( Figure 2 ). Upon infection by IBV, Flag-tagged MADP1 appeared to be present in the cytoplasm as well ( Figure 2) . Interestingly, the cytoplasmic localization pattern of Flag-tagged MADP1 appears to be partially overlapped with that for the RTCs, although further studies would be required to ascertain if MADP1 would be a part of the RTCs ( Figure 2 ). As a negative control for the over-expressed protein, vector transfected cells probed with Flag antibody showed negative staining for the over-expressed protein ( Figure 2 ).

The biotin-labeled RNA transcripts were used in the biotin-RNA pull-down assay ( Figure 3B ) to check the efficiency of Flag-tagged MADP1 co-purification with RNA. Results showed that MADP1 was co-purified only with transcripts which contain stem-loops I-III of the 5 0 -UTR (5 0 -UTR\u00c11 and 5 0 -UTR\u00c12). In addition, stem-loop I appeared to be essential for interacting with MADP1 as its absence in 5 0 -UTR\u00c13 abolished the interaction with MADP1 ( Figure 3B ). The rest region of the 5 0 -UTR (5 0 -UTR\u00c14) did not appear to interact with MADP1 ( Figure 3B ).",

The mutant RNAs spanning stemloops I-III were assessed for its ability to bind MADP1. The result indicated that the integrity of stem-loop I may be essential for the interaction between the 5 0 -UTR with MADP1 ( Figure 3D ), as the stem-loop disrupting mutation (5 0 -UTR\u00c12M1) failed to interact with MADP1. The stem-loop restoring mutation at nucleotide residues 25 and 26 from UC to AG was able to restore partially the interaction (5 0 -UTR\u00c12M2) ( Figure 3D ).

Hence, a third coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, whose stem-loop I which deviated further from IBV than SARS-CoV, was assessed for its binding to MADP1 ( Figure 8A ). It was found that the binding of MADP1 to the 5 0 UTR of HCoV-OC43 was as weak, if not weaker than SARS-CoV. It was also noted that the predicted stem-loop I structure of HCoV-OC43 contained a bulge which encompassed a larger area of the stem compared to SARS-CoV ( Figure 8B ). Bulges were conspicuously absent from the IBV stem-loop I ( Figure 8B ). In addition to the differences in the secondary structures between the coronaviruses, there was a lack of sequence similarity as well ( Figure 8B ).",

Some of these proteins may also interact with other viral proteins as well (30, 40) . Our attempts to identify host proteins involved in this early process of the coronavirus life cycle yielded MADP1. This protein was shown to be localized to the nucleoplasm but excluded from the nucleolus, but its role in RNA splicing remains to be determined (37) . MADP1 contains two conserved RNA-binding domains, the RNA recognition motif (RRM) 1 and universal minicircle sequence binding protein (UMSBP) domains (a zinc finger CCHC-type) (35) . The former was determined to be the domain responsible for the interaction between MADP1 and IBV 5 0 -UTR. The MADP1 RRM 1 domain interacts with nucleic acid residues via aromatic and hydrophobic side chains at its active site, which in the case supplied by phenylalanine 55 and valine 53, respectively. Tyrosine 13 may have acted as an anchor for the phosphate backbone via electrostatic interactions.",

A deeper look at the details of this interaction revealed that the RNA recognition motif, but not the zinc finger motif, of MADP1, is responsible for the interaction. This interaction is also shown to be specific and stem-loop I of IBV 5 0 -UTR is essential for the interaction to occur. Although MADP1 was reported to be a nuclear protein (35) , it could be detected in the cytoplasm of IBV-infected cells and partially overlaps with the de novo synthesized viral RNA, which marks the location of the RTCs in infected cells in the presence of actinomycin D. Silencing of MADP1 resulted in a marked reduction in syncytium formation upon IBV infection. A closer examination revealed that the synthesis of both genome-(gRNA) and subgenome-length RNAs (sgRNA) was compromised, resulting in a drastic reduction of viral structural protein expression and release of viral progeny (titers), hence the overall reduction of viral infectivity in the cells.",

Mutations introduced into either stem-loop I or II resulted in non-viable viruses, impaired (sense and anti-sense) sgRNA synthesis, but not the full-length gRNA synthesis (38, 44) . It was, however, observed in this study that silencing of MADP1 did render an impact on gRNA synthesis, although to a lesser extent compared to sgRNA synthesis. This might have been due to a secondary effect of decreased sgRNA synthesis, as proteins encoded by sgRNAs may enhance viral RNA synthesis (45) . The predicted structure of stem-loop II indicated a strong secondary interaction, which is highly conserved across different groups of coronaviruses. The predicted stem-loop I structure, on the other hand, appears to fold into a hairpin of low thermodynamic stability, shows a wider sequence variation and is characterized by the presence of bulges, non-canonical base pairing as well as a prevalence of A-U base pairing (46) . It has been shown in MHV that the structural liability of stem-loop I is a critical driving force in the 5 0 -and 3 0 -UTR interaction (44) . Comparing the predicted stemloop I structures of IBV to SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 ( Figure 8B) , it was noted that there exists a difference in the loop sequence. In addition, IBV stem-loop I has a shorter stem and the absence of bulges, although the structure may be as unstable thermodynamically as that of SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43, due to the extremely high prevalence of weak base pairing between A and U as well as the presence of a non-canonical base pair at the base of the stem (46) . Hence, sequence and structural differences may be one of the possible explanations for the observation of a weaker binding between MADP1 and SARS-CoV or HCoV-OC43 5 0 -UTR than with IBV 5 0 -UTR. In fact, the relatively weaker binding of MADP1 to the stem-loop I restoring mutant (5 0 -UTR\u00c12M2) demonstrated in this study supports that primary sequences in the 5 0 -UTR may play a certain role in this interaction.",

The functional implication of the interaction between MADP1 and IBV 5 0 -UTR may be extended to the rest of the members of the coronavirus family. In the case of hnRNP A1, it was initially reported to be functionally important for viral RNA synthesis for group II virus MHV (29, 30) . Subsequently, its involvement in viral RNA synthesis was also confirmed in TGEV, a group I coronavirus (32) . In this study, we have shown that betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and gammacoronavirus IBV can bind to MADP1, albeit with different affinities. Due to the lack of a high containment facility, the functional implication of the relatively weaker interaction between SARS-CoV 5 0 -UTR and MADP1 was not further studied. It is, therefore, yet to be demonstrated if this weaker binding dictates less dependency on MADP1 in SARS-CoV RNA replication and infectivity.",

Considering the fact that only 30% of cells were transfected and over-expressed MADP1 protein despite the presence of a higher level of the protein in the transfected cells, it is understandable that the expression of viral proteins could not be restored after combining both transfected and untransfected cells. Interestingly, over-expression of silencing-sensitive MADP1 was unable to cause an increase in virus infection, comparing to that was observed for silencingresistant MADP1 (FMmut) in shMadp1 cells, even though their expression levels were comparable. This lends further support to the conclusion that MADP1 is actively involved in the replication and infectivity of IBV.",

The African green monkey genome is not available at NCBI, but an alignment search using basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) of the MADP1 amino acid sequence against the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) RefSeq Protein library yields a 99% sequence similarity between the two species. The chicken homolog, on the other hand, bears 85% amino acid sequence similarity, but with an almost identical match in the N-terminal 120 amino acids, to the human MADP1 protein. As the predicted interaction domain lies in the N-terminus, it is highly likely that the homologs from other species could replace human MADP1 in the interaction studies.",
