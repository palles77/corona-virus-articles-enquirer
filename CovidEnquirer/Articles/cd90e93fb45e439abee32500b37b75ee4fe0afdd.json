            "text": "Urban and rural environments show clear differences in morphology, production mode and culture. With rapid urbanisation, these differences have become a major cause of urbanerural conflict. One of the most significant challenges arises from land acquisition, particularly in China, where cities have experienced substantial growth in the 21st century. Different types of risk are associated with land acquisition conflict in different Chinese cities. In this study, two types of cities are discussed: those with a historically low level of development but recent rapid economic growth, such as Yueqing; and cities that have maintained a relatively high level of development and experienced stable growth, such as Jiaxing. Land acquisition conflict in these two representative cities is then analysed in terms of property rights, access to resources and development. Analysis is performed at the institutional level to provide more accurate insights into the dynamics of conflict. The findings of the study suggest that different risk-management strategies are used in the two kinds of city, and that conflict is more likely to occur in cities with historically weaker development, such as Yueqing. To avoid such conflict, systematic risk-management strategies should be established in these cities.",

Economists refer to urbanisation as a positive process that enhances economic growth and increases national wealth. However, it can also result in unemployment, violence, poverty, congestion and environmental problems. Urbanisation has been described as a process of 'eating up' rural land in response to increasing demand from residents and private firms (Zhang, 2010) . The proportion of the population living in urban settings in the mid-20th century in Western countries was 72% in the United States, 87% in the United Kingdom, 79% in the Federal Republic of Germany, 86% in the Netherlands and 77% in Canada. By the 1960s, these figures had all exceeded 80%, with the rural population of the United States accounting for only 3e5% of the total population. Three cities in developed countries, New York, London and Tokyo, now have more than 6 million residents each. Cities in developing countries also have rapidly increasing urban populations, for example, those of Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City now exceed 6 million (Chu, 2013) .",

This rapid urbanisation is critical to China's economic development (Shan & Wu, 2016) . Urbanisation assists industrialisation and economic development through the recruitment of surplus rural labour, and is therefore beneficial to the government (Zhang & Liu, 2001) , but an increasing urban population also brings problems such as bad housing conditions, underemployment, less land available for agriculture and urban environmental pollution, all of which adversely affect economic development (Yao, 1994; Wu, Luo, Zhang, & Skitmore, 2016) .",

The highest rates of land conversion from rural to urban are observed in counties experiencing rapid economic growth (Marlow, Ralph, & Kenneth, 1994) . Pressure on urban land is increasing across the developing world, and is manifested in several ways. The problem of urban land conflict is growing (Horman & Orleans, 2015) , and urbanisation has intensified urbanerural tension, as well as increasing the number of landless and jobless farmers. Urbanerural conflict management should therefore be further explored and clarified. Risk management is a control function designed to maintain a safe operational boundary for a particular hazardous process of production (Rasmussen, 1997) . The management of conflict risk can thus play an extremely important role in urbanisation by ensuring that key aspects of the conflict remain within a relatively safe border, thereby reducing social risk.",

Economic development has resulted in a high level of labour migration from rural to urban areas, with urban land expansion and farming land loss as the most significant land-use changes, accompanied by environmental degradation and land conflict (Chen, Zhang, Song, & Zhang, 2016) . During China's urbanisation, farmers have migrated from the agricultural sector to the non-agricultural sector and agricultural land has been put to non-agricultural uses, mainly through land acquisition by the state (Lou, 2007) .",

Therefore, preventing or at least reducing various forms of conflict through risk management is of great importance to urbanerural development (Yu, Wu, Zheng, Zhang, & Shen, 2014) . Urban and rural labour resources, urban land expansion and rural farmland protection are the three main factors that can result in property conflict. Resource conflict can be triggered by environmental damage, competition for natural resources, urban industrial transfer, rural environmental protection, the diffusion of pollution from urban to rural areas and/ or the effects of agricultural pollution on municipal water supplies. Development conflict may arise from infrastructure construction, the distribution of educational resources, differences in environmental management between urban and rural areas, rural development and/or the return of farmland to forest (Yu et al., 2015) . This study investigates the nature of urbanerural conflict and the influence of urbanisation with reference to three key types of conflict: property conflict, resource conflict and development conflict. A framework of cultural, political and system-level analysis is used to provide recommendations for devising land-use policies to mitigate urbanerural conflict (Wu & Luo, 2015) . The three kinds of conflict are interrelated (Fig. 1) , and are the main types of urbanerural conflict in China (Yu, Wu & Zheng, 2014) .",

The aim of conflict control is to mitigate and ultimately end conflict.

The goal of conflict resolution is to eliminate the root causes of incompatibility. The equality of others and their need for participation are considered, which can eliminate deep dissatisfaction and help to build long-term relationships. However, as conflict control often incurs lower costs, is more effective and avoids the 'volunteer's dilemma', it is difficult to argue for conflict-resolution methods (Zhang, 2014) .",

The construction of new buildings for housing, industry and business resulted in largescale migration to the outskirts of cities, significantly dispersing the population and jobs. New problems emerged in relation to land resources, ecological and environmental protection, class conflict, social culture and particularly urbanerural conflict. The most significant threat posed by urbanisation is that construction swallows up land previously used for agriculture, forestry and mining, so the rural population loses its main economic resources (Zhu & Yue, 2006) . In China, the historical gap between the urban and the rural has widened further, leading to urbanerural conflict. This conflict is manifested in two ways: first, between urban and rural levels of government, on issues such as human-resources training, the possession of public resources and the distribution of educational resources; and second, between urban and rural residents, whose economic, political and cultural interests are at odds (Huang, 2010) . Disagreement and outright conflict also occur in areas such as the environment, development opportunities, resource acquisition, public-goods supply, management and the cultural fusion of the urban and the rural. In terms of ecological conflict, the environmental pollution caused by urban expansion exacerbates the erosion and destruction of agricultural and ecological environments by urbanisation, in addition to the exploitation of ecological environmental resources. In terms of development conflict, household registration limitations have created significant discrepancies in the types of employment and degree of remuneration available to migrant workers and urban residents. Unstable employment and wage arrears create a strong sense of insecurity among migrant workers. Conflict over the supply of public goods may arise from the urbanerural division underscored by the household registration system, which divides infrastructure and public services into the two entirely separate categories of urban and rural provision. Urbanisation has exacerbated the exploitation of rural land, water, labour and other resources, creating conflict over resource acquisition. This urbanerural inequality in resource allocation has continued to increase under the combined influence of political and market changes (Liu & Li, 2011) .",

Stakeholders pursue their own interests in competing for limited land resources, leading to conflict. Tan (2008) has shown that land acquisition has proceeded smoothly and that serious land conflicts have been avoided in other developed countries such as the US, the UK, Austria and Germany, indicating that there is no necessary link between land acquisition and land conflict. The reasons for the frequent clashes over land acquisition in China are extremely complex. Land acquisition does not follow statutory procedures, the impounding of land is illegal, compensation and resettlement procedures are unsystematic, town or village officials may be guilty of misconduct, farmers may have improper joint operations and local governments may lack the capability to manage land disputes. In 2009, Tan constructed a game-theory model of local government officials and farmers, and concluded that reducing the cost of the legal right to safeguard land, increasing the benefit of land acquisition for farmers who have lost their land, and enforcing higher penalties for illegal land acquisition can effectively discourage local governments from illegally expropriating land. These measures were also found to reduce the phenomenon of landless farmers' appealing to higher authorities for help, thereby minimising conflict over land and promoting harmonious economic and social development (Tan & Tu, 2009 ).",

Beck (2004) first put forward the risk-society theory as key to comprehending modern society. Giddens pointed out that traditional social risk is a local, individual and natural characteristic of external risk, whilst risk in modern society is a global, social and man-made structural risk (Giddens, 2001; Kang, 2006; Yang & Zhao, 2008) . Estes (1984) identified six general causes of social instability: the autocratic behaviour of leading figures in social organisations; a lack of social resources; political instability; an inability to satisfy human needs; and the collapse of family structure or traditional culture. In 1999, against the background of economic globalisation, the World Bank expanded on its existing social-security policy by proposing a social risk management strategy to address the challenges of social development. A variety of risk-control methods were used in the resulting risk-prevention and compensationarrangement system to comprehensively and dynamically deal with the increasingly serious social risks faced by nations (Lin, 2002) . Holzmann and Jorgensen (2000) argued that a social risk management framework comprises risk-management actors and a risk-management strategy and system made up of various prevention, mitigation and coping strategies (Holzmann, 2001) . Labour, human rights and environmental sustainability are usually regarded as part of social risk (Kytle, Hamilton and Ruggie, 2005; Zhang, 2011) .",

In China, scholars have investigated risk management in the context of rapid urbanisation. Social risk can be divided into three categories: traditional risk, such as earthquakes, floods, tsunamis and other natural disasters and diseases (e.g., acquired immune deficiency syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the highly pathogenic avian influenza); social risk, or the risk of system disintegration brought about by social changes such as unemployment, increasing mobility, a trust crisis and moral and other problems; and risk caused by modernisation, such as ecological crisis, terrorism, the development of high-tech ventures, changes in the population structure and network and globalisation problems. In China today, these three forms of risk coexist, and their interaction may continue for many years. Transformation risk and modernisation risk have the greatest influence on modern Chinese society (Liu, 2008) .",

Land acquisition and compensation procedures are extremely difficult to implement as part of development projects. For instance, landrelated conflict has occurred across Vietnam (Phuc, 2014) . Between 2004 and 2009, land acquisition conflict in China accounted for approximately 65% of public disturbances in rural areas each year (Ding, 2011) . Chinese scholars have therefore extensively researched the causes of land acquisition risk (Zhong, 2013) and its assessment (Zhang, Li, & Liu, 2010; Tang & Liu, 2010) and management (Zhu, 2013) . Departments of land management have the main responsibility for implementing the current land acquisition risk assessment system, and expert opinions are usually sought during risk evaluation. However, problems may still occur, such as unknown evaluation targets, an unclear policy orientation and unscientific evaluation procedures. Wang and Li (2011) recommended standardising the system of land expropriation risk assessment and establishing and optimising mechanisms for the support and supervision of risk assessment relating to land acquisition conflict. The process of assessment is made more reasonable and scientific by clarifying land risk evaluation targets and orientations, improving the land acquisition risk assessment system and optimising land evaluation. Wang et al. (2014) found that the risk index for social stability in China's current land acquisition context is as high as 67.672%, and that the risk index for compensation and resettlement (75.033%) is higher than that for a land-collection programme and a production and livelihood programme, respectively. Therefore, a hierarchical risk assessment system for social stability privileging land collection over compensation and resettlement and production and livelihood programmes should be established.",

            "text": "China's non-private land ownership laws mean that all urban land is owned by the state, and that land in rural and suburban areas is primarily owned by rural collectives (along with the state). This urbanerural distinction may lead to conflict between national and collective ownership. In China's cities, land is nationally owned; in the country, it is owned collectively. Therefore, the urbanisation of land has become the most important dimension of urbanisation, with the movement of rural land from collective to national ownership through land acquisition by the government. Two main problems arise during such land acquisition. First, land acquisition cannot be implemented in rural areas in urgent need of land urbanisation due to problems with location, policy, etc. Second, urban fringe areas are compulsorily demolished and removed during urbanisation, with opposition from most farmers. In the Chinese context, therefore, the main focus of urbanerural conflict arising from urbanisation is the problem of acquisition, which reveals three more direct and concrete manifestations of the urbanerural conflict, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . Conflict caused simply by the existing urbanerural divide is amplified by external forces (i.e., land acquisition). Fig. 2 summarises the three categories of acquisition conflict: property conflict, resource conflict and development conflict. Cases of property conflict, which arises during land acquisition and expropriation, have three key features: the differential mode of transfer of real estate between urban and rural areas; urbanerural inequality in land income; and the competing demand for land for urban expansion and rural farmland protection. China's urbanerural land structure means that the urban population, unlike their rural counterparts, can transfer real estate smoothly while retaining a high income. When rural land is converted to urban land through land acquisition and expropriation, farmers' income is reduced. Those previously able to make a living from farming are likely to lose their livelihoods after land acquisition and expropriation, and it is difficult for farmers to find good jobs in urban areas. Resource conflict can arise due to the pollution of the rural environment by urban industrial projects and clashes over natural resources and inequitable resource allocation. China's urban and rural populations have different production modes. Urban areas are industrial, and rural areas are mainly agricultural. With China's urban expansion, an increasing number of factories have been constructed on rural land, increasing pollution and the use of natural resources such as water and land. Development conflict arises from policy configurations emphasising urban areas over rural areas. Public-security administration and the distribution of educational resources are also sources of conflict. A focus on urban areas leads to an uneven distribution of educational resources, security measures and public infrastructure. Farmers who lose their farmland and residential land to urbanisation are excluded from sources of social insurance. In short, as they are required to take on a different type of labour, they lose much more than their land through land acquisition. Urbanerural property conflict may arise during the acquisition or reservation of agricultural land, as the compensation may be lower than the economic gain afforded by land acquisition. Resource conflict may also arise, as land-use changes during urbanisation cause pollution and decrease rural natural resources. From a developmental perspective, the acquisition or reservation of agricultural land may lead to rural unemployment due to the education gap between urban and rural areas.",

After 1978, discrepancies in urban development across China increased, and numerous cities with slow historical development experienced rapid industrialisation and urbanisation after the introduction of the reform and opening up policy.

In contrast, cities with consistently high levels of economic, political, social and cultural development experienced less urbanerural conflict as a result of rapid urbanisation and land acquisition. In addition, authorities in the latter type of city have also begun to construct conflict-management systems, providing experience in the management of urbanerural conflict.

In contrast, Jiaxing has an optimal location and abundant natural resources, and has long been known as 'the land of fish and rice' or 'the home of silk'.

It was a traffic accident, however, Mr Qian had repeatedly petitioned for land acquisition on behalf of the villagers. Due to Mr Qian's high profile and involvement with land acquisition petitions, news of the event spread quickly, and the subject was passionately debated on online networks such as the Sina microblog and the Tianya forum. Rumours from the landless villagers such as 'deliberately run over' flooded online networks (Wang, 2011) . Fortunately, the government solved the problem in time and stopped the spread of the rumours. Setting public opinion aside, however, and focusing on land acquisition conflict, this case reveals the increasingly severe contradictions in China's land acquisition policies. Informal riots occur when a group of citizens living in the same geographical area express their common anger and discontent in relatively spontaneous ways (Almond & Powell, 1987) . In the process of land acquisition, informal riots may block streets and lead to violent protest. Villagers' petitions provide an example of institutional political participation.",

In-depth analysis of these factors reveals that institutional factors play the most important role in deepening public discord and accelerating conflict. Farmers generally regard land acquisition as a method of government centralisation. Differences between urban and rural areas in terms of social insurance (education, medical care, housing, etc.) and the dual household registration system are the key concerns of landless farmers, related to their means of production and livelihoods. Landless farmers are also concerned with the inequity of rights and other cultural and political issues raised by land acquisition.

The policy of two divisions rural homesteads/contracted land and two exchanges (rural-house demolition/land acquisition) led to the construction of a new rural community. More specifically, 'two exchanges' refers to the process of exchanging rural homesteads for urban real estate and exchanging rural land contracting management rights for social security. Farmers can transfer their rural land contracting (Qiu & Wang, 2010) . The two divisions and two exchanges policy has given farmers greater choice. Those seeking to change their living environment can give up their homesteads but reserve contracted land; others can give up contracted land in exchange for social insurance. Those who voluntarily become urban citizens can give up their homesteads in exchange for real estate in town, and abandon their contracted land in exchange for social insurance. They then become part of the city, which is another manifestation of urbanisation. The practice of two divisions and two exchanges achieved good results from the very beginning. In 2009, 10,854 households signed up, 2816 sets of settlement housing were built or rebuilt, 4321 households relocated, 7142 households were moved and land contract and management rights covering 3200 ha were transferred.",

Farmers can select the land-use type most valuable to them in either urban areas or rural agricultural areas, helping the government to balance the land demands of urban expansion and rural farmland protection. The replacement of homesteads means that landless farmers can attain the same housing conditions as urban citizens, which eases the conflict between urban and rural areas caused by differences in the methods of transfer of real estate and land income (residential income). With regard to resource conflict, farmers can choose to work in the city or continue to farm their land to earn a living. They can also choose their lifestyle based on whether they prefer living in the countryside or in the city. The choice of an urban lifestyle decreases differences in living habits. Farmers are also given options, rights and advantages in the competition for natural resources, which can reduce the pollution caused by urban industrial projects. Development conflict is sometimes difficult to resolve, but the policy takes the future demands of farmers into consideration and gives them the chance to become urban residents with a fair level of social security.

Regulating the risk factors associated with land acquisition can alleviate conflict. However, in the case of Mr Qian's death, urbanerural conflict broke out due to a defective system. During the land acquisition process, property conflict arises primarily from differences in the methods of transfer of real estate between urban and rural areas, income inequality in land income and the competing demand for land for urban expansion and rural farmland protection. Therefore, decreasing the difference between land income in urban and rural areas will play a key role in improving land acquisition compensation and reducing the risk of conflict. Resource conflict arises from the pollution of the rural environment by urban industrial projects, contention over natural resources and/or the unequal use of resources. Although analysis shows that urban areas always take priority over rural areas in the competition for natural resources and that environmental resources tend to be transferred from rural areas, the two divisions and two exchanges programme implemented in Jiaxing ensures that those at risk of losing their land are fully consulted, that their suggestions and demands are considered and that reasonable channels for institutionalised political participation (petitions, etc.) are provided. This reduces the risk of conflict. Finally, development conflict may arise from policy configurations that emphasise urban areas and ignore rural areas, security-administration conflicts and/or the uneven distribution of educational resources. It is difficult to resolve the discrepancy between urban and rural education and its effect on the land acquisition process; however, adjustable policies will strengthen the participation of those who lose their land, thereby further reducing the risk factors (see Fig. 6 ).",

Therefore, the role of the government is closely connected with urbanerural conflict. In China, the government has a monopoly on power. Local government is concentrated at a high level. Market rights are highly influenced by policies and social rights are concentrated, forming a highly centralised administrative system. Government centralisation is clearly reflected in land policy. China's land system is characterised by a combination of state ownership and collective ownership. However, collective land is essentially controlled by the state, and cannot be transferred to the land market except through government expropriation and acquisition. As the value of rural collective farmland is not released to the market, farmers do not benefit as much as urban residents from the great economic growth resulting from land acquisition. Local governments tend to acquire land at low prices. Therefore, the compensation provided for agricultural-land acquisition is far lower than the gains resulting from the transfer (Weng, 2005) . Farmers' income is also reduced by the activities of village managers, resettlement units and other intervening layers. The government receives a large income from the transfer of land, with longer-term benefits through investment. However, those who lose their land do not enjoy the same benefits. The increasing number of landless farmers in China is testament to the damage done to this population, which has intensified the discrepancies and conflict between urban and rural areas. Therefore, it is vital to reform government-centralisation policies to increase the credibility of the government and better serve the community.",

To minimise the cultural differences between urban and rural areas, Desakota cultural systems can be established to promote convergence in all areas.",

Analysis of conflicts factors in land acquisition (connected to Fig. 2) . registration system divides citizens by family and tenure into two categories: an 'urban population' and a 'rural population'. These categories correspond to different levels of social status. Citizens are branded with an urban or rural identity at birth, conferring a different status, different benefits and different rights and obligations. The household registration system thus creates divisions between urban and rural areas, causing political, economic and cultural divergence between agricultural and non-agricultural populations. There are significant differences, for instance, between the urban and rural social security systems. Their serious imbalance is not conducive to efforts to resolve problems in rural areas and ultimately build a moderately prosperous society in terms of education, health care and housing. In China, the influence of the market economy has resulted in changes to the household registration system. On 30 July 2014, the State Council published a regulation on the 'further promotion of the reform of the household registration system'. This regulation was designed to solve the problem of a large rural population long resident in China's cities by improving their employability and ability to adapt to the competitive urban environment. The hope is that their families will be newly able to settle in cities and towns, increasing the orderliness of population flow. The aims of this policy are to promote the rational distribution of small cities and towns, to enhance economic concentration and to create favourable conditions for the transfer of agricultural populations settled in towns. This policy, along with the reform of the household registration system, is expected to create a better and fairer social system. Land expropriation cannot be avoided in regions undergoing rapid urbanisation. In China, land acquisition is the only way of converting rural land to urban land; therefore, land acquisition is the fundamental premise of land urbanisation. However, land acquisition activities also lead to urban and rural conflict. This study shows that land acquisition risk management strategies differ between regions, and that cities with previously lower levels of industrial economic development have grown more quickly in recent years with an expansion of urban land. Strategies for managing the risk associated with land acquisition in these cities should thus be developed to prevent or decrease urbanerural conflict. A number of strategies are possible. First, a conflict administration system should be established by the government. Second, it is important to respect farmers' choices during land acquisition, so formal and informal mechanisms for communication between farmers and government authorities should be established. Third, increasing the compensation provided for land acquisition will decrease conflict in cities. Fourth, laws or rules for land acquisition should be established to decrease acquisition for urban economic use and maximise the use of land to provide public-welfare services. Finally, it would be beneficial to improve the law-enforcement mechanism for land acquisition and increase the supervision of this mechanism.",

As the acquisition of land to facilitate urban expansion is an important cause of conflict between urban and rural areas, managing the risk factors leading to urbanerural conflict over land acquisition is very important. Two types of city are addressed in this paper: the first consistently showing a relatively high degree of economic, political and cultural development and government-management ability, with Jiaxing as an example; and the second exhibiting weaker historical economic development but rapid growth after China's reform and opening up, with Yueqing as an example. Although the demand for urban land and consequently land acquisition have increased in the latter type of city, no scientific systems have been implemented to manage risk. In Jiaxing, the two divisions and two exchanges land acquisition policy has given farmers the right to choose and comprehensively protected their interests. In Yueqing, however, strategies for managing the risk associated with land acquisition are relatively informal and contingent on particular land acquisition projects, and are thus less effective. As a result, incidents such as the death of Qian have exacerbated urbanerural conflict in Yueqing. Cities like Yueqing urgently require comprehensive risk management strategies to reduce conflict between urban and rural.",

This paper investigates these three types of conflict and the 21 key factors causing urbanerural conflict proposed by Yu et al. (2015) with specific reference to land acquisition. The key causes of property conflict are differences in the mode of transfer of real estate between urban and rural areas, urbanerural land income inequality and the competing demand for land for urban expansion and rural farmland protection. The key causes of resource conflict are the pollution of the rural environment caused by urban industrial projects, the competition for natural resources and inequitable resource use. The key causes of development conflict are policy configurations that emphasise urban areas over rural areas and the inequitable allocation of social security and distribution of educational resources.",
