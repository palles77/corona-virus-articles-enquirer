Early clinical manifestations of these central nervous system (CNS)-associated complications are often non-specific and patients commonly present with altered mental status or delirium with or without seizures (Rosenfeld and Pruitt, 2006) . CNS infections in these patients have been suggested to play a role in development of neurologic disorders (Donati et al., 2003; Rosenfeld and Pruitt, 2006) and were more frequently observed in allogeneic transplants cases most likely related to prolonged immune suppression. A wide spectrum of pathogens associated with CNS-related complications in-cluding both bacterial and viral species have been described. Some of these opportunistic agents include staphylococci, Pneumocystis carinii, Listeria monocytogenes, adenovirus, Coxsackievirus B4, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and recently Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). Consequences associated with CNS infections in allogeneic post-BMT or SCT can be fatal due to their inability to mount sufficient inflammatory responses as a result of immunosuppressant medication. In addition, the classic findings of fever and meningismus may be absent rendering early diagnosis difficult.",

Conventional laboratory methods used for identification of such pathogens are time consuming and labor intensive and often require large quantities of clinical samples. Therefore, to aid diagnosis, assays are needed for simultaneous consideration of multiple agents. We had previously reported on the development and use of a multivirus array containing eight genetically and pathologically diverse human viruses including: HIV-1, HTLV-I, HTLV-II, HHV-6A, HHV-6B, EBV, KSHV, and HCV (Ghedin et al., 2004) . In contrast to other pathogen-array platforms (Wang et al., 2003) , this multi-virus array comprehensively represents every open reading frame of every virus in replicates of 12. These properties may contribute to increased sensitivity as well as specificity of detection, as we had previously shown virus specific hybridization using materials derived from singly or co-infected in vitro cell lines (Ghedin et al., 2004) . Additionally, we were able to demonstrate varied HHV-6A viral gene expression in infected human primary astrocytes cultures compared to susceptible lymphocytic cell line (Yao et al., 2006) supporting the neurotropism of this beta-herpesvirus in vitro. The versatile design of this multi-virus array platform may provide a rapid and \"unbiased\" approach for the identification of pathogenic organisms related to neurologic disorders associated with transplant recipients.",

Briefly, 2 mg of amplified anti-sense were reverse transcribed into cDNA using 6 mg of random hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) with 2 mL of Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), 6 mL of 5X First Strand Buffer (Invitrogen), 3 mL of 0.1M DTT (Invitrogen) and 0.6 mL 50X a-dNTP with a dCTP:dTTP ratio of 2:3. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out in a final volume of 30 mL at 42\u00baC overnight in a water bath. RNA template was hydrolyzed with 10 mL 1M NaOH after completion of cDNA synthesis. Ten microliters of EDTA (Invitrogen, CA) were added followed by 15 minutes heating at 65\u00baC to inactivate all enzymatic reactions and 25 mL of 1M Hepes pH = 7.0 was subsequently added. cDNA was then purified with Micron-30 Spin Columns (Millipore, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions and samples were dried under vacuum centrifugation. Each sample was re-suspended in 4.5 mL of 0.1M carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 , pH = 9.0) and 4.5 mL of either NHS-Cy3 or NHS-Cy5 (Amersham Pharmacia, NJ) to fluorescently label the cDNA probe. Incubation at room temperature proceeded for one hour in the dark. Post CyDye coupling, 35 mL of 100mM NaOAc (pH = 5.2) was added to assist in cDNA precipitation. Purification was performed using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions and samples were eluded in 100 mL of RNase/DNase free H 2 O.",

To investigate and confirm the presence of an active infection from autopsy material derived from this post-BMT recipient, we also performed analysis of viral messenger RNA expression using the multi-virus array. As there is significant overlap on the nucleic acid sequence level between HHV-6 DNA and RNA, to ensure specific detection of viral gene expression, we linearly amplified all messenger RNA from total RNA derived from the left insular cortex using previously described methods (Conejero-Goldberg et al., 2005; Feldman et al., 2002) . Similarly, messenger RNA was also amplified from the control brain and used for normalization of background signals. As shown in Fig. 3 , up-regulated HHV-6 gene expression could be observed for the following gene transcripts: DR1, LJ1, U24, U33, U43, U77 and U89.

Comparing conventional laboratory techniques such as serology or PCR amplification, which often require large quantities of starting materials when multiple pathogenic agents are considered, the multi-virus array approach offers a number of advantages over current accepted methods. In the case of allogeneic transplant patients, serological testing for antibody against suspected agents may not be informative due to immune suppression. However, with multi-virus array analysis, in a single hybridization, all potential agents are screened without the need of extensive manipulation of a limited amount of clinical samples. Additionally, less starting material is required as all potential candidates are tested simultaneously as opposed to PCR amplification for individual candidate pathogens separately. Moreover, as studies of viral gene expression often require a large amount of RNA samples that are rarely attainable with clinical samples, the linear amplification of messenger RNA coupled with multi-virus array analysis opens the possibility to investigate the mechanism of viral gene expression using ex-vivo tissue. Two variants of HHV-6 have been described, HHV-6A and HHV-6B. Although sharing over 95% sequence homology, these two viruses have different biological properties, cellular tropism and clinical associations Donati et al., 2003 Donati et al., , 2005 Soldan et al., 1997) . The HHV-6 B variant is exclusively associated with development of post-bone marrow encephalitis (Gentile, 2000) . The ability of our multi-virus array to distinguish and subtype variant specific viruses further highlights its potential for use in clinical settings. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 , detection of HHV-6 variant B specific transcript U89 is consistent with the role of HHV-6B in development of post-BMT encephalitis. Interestingly, of the HHV-6 transcripts detected, the U24 glycoprotein which shares an immunodominant peptide sequence with brain myelin basic protein has been shown to elicit immune response from T cells derived from multiple sclerosis patients, suggesting an immune mediated pathogenic mechanism of HHV-6 in CNS disorders (Tejada-Simon et al., 2003) . Pharmacologically, several case reports have also supported the involvement of HHV-6 in post-BMT neurological complications as administration of ganciclovir resulted in resolution of symptoms (Rapaport et al., 2002; Yoshida et al., 2002) . Therefore, rapid and specific identification of pathogens likely to be responsible for particular clinical manifestations may increase chances of survival of these patients. As evident in this study, extensive viral infection was already found in the CNS shortly after the initial presentation of mental status change at autopsy, which further stresses the need for development of rapid, sensitive assays for identification of pathogenic agents.",

Therefore, continual development of multi-virus array detection with enhanced sensitivity is critical as only low viral burden may be associated with initial phase of the disease process. Additionally, extending the multi-virus array used in this study, which contains eight genetically and pathologically diverse viruses, to include other known CNS-related pathogens for detection of infections in the brain represents a novel, \"unbiased\" approach to study a number of neurologic complications with unknown etiology. This approach not only would define the agent(s) that may be associated with a disease but could also identify potential pathogenic viral gene products. As pathogen-arrays have been instrumental in the discovery of other human pathogens such as SARScoronavirus (Wang et al., 2003) , the possibility of using a multi-virus array to aid clinical diagnosis may provide insight into the microbial flora of the CNS and mechanisms of viral-host interaction.",
