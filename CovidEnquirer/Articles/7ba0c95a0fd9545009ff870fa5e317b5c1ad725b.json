            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a coronavirus that induces a fatal systemic disease mediated by an inappropriate immune response. Most previous vaccination attempts against FIPV were unsuccessful because IgG antibodies against the surface protein enhance the infection. However, two studies have shown that poxvirus vectors (vaccinia WR and canarypox) expressing only the FIPV membrane (M) protein can elicit a partially protective immunity which is supposed to be cell-mediated (Virology 181 (1991) 327; International patent WO 97/20054 (1997)). In our study, we report the construction of another poxvirus, the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), as an expression vector for the FIPV M protein. In this vector, the M gene has been inserted downstream a strong early/late promoter, whereas the two previously described poxviruses expressed the M protein during their early stage only. The immunogenicity of the recombinant MVA-M was evaluated in the murine model which revealed an effect of the vector on the Th1/Th2 balance. The vaccine was then tested in cats to evaluate its efficacy in an FIPV 79-1146 challenge. Vaccinated kittens developed FIPV-specific antibodies after immunization, however, none of them was protected against FIPV. Our results suggest a crucial role for the type of poxviral promoter that must be used to induce an effective immune response against FIPV.",

They are thus classified in two groups depending on their pathogenicity: feline enteritic coronaviruses (FECVs) and feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPVs) (see for review : Olsen, 1993) . Several vaccination trials against the lethal FIPV strains have been attempted but they were often unsuccessful due to a problem of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of the disease that leads to early death. In contrast, cats naturally resistant to FIPV present a strong cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and a weak antibody response (Pedersen, 1987) . Therefore, an efficient vaccine should preferentially induce a CMI, also called Th1-type response, characterized by CD4+ helper T-lymphocytes secreting interleukin 2 (IL-2) and Interferon gamma (IFN-) (Th1 cells) and by CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).",

The S protein has been shown to be responsible of ADE and thus does not induce a protective immune response (Vennema et al., 1990) . In contrast, the M protein, but not the N protein, is partially protective when expressed by poxvirus vectors like vaccinia or canarypox viruses (Paoletti and Gettig, 1997; Vennema et al., 1991) . Such protection occurred in the absence of neutralizing antibodies, and was thought to be due to CMI.",

MVA is an attenuated strain of the vaccinia virus Ankara, that has lost the ability to replicate in mammalian cells (Sutter and Moss, 1992) . Thus MVA is safe but remains a strong expression vector because it can still express foreign antigens during both the early and late stages of its life cycle. Herein, we used this feature to construct a recombinant MVA expressing the M protein (MVA-M) during both stages in order to synthesize larger amounts of antigen compared to the canarypox-M and vaccinia-M vaccines.",

Surprisingly, mice pre-immunized with wtMVA produced predominantly FIPV-specific IgG1 after inoculation of 10 8 pfu of MVA-M, equivalently to a double injection, but a weaker IgG2a level (significant difference according to the Newman-Keuls multiple-comparison test). This inversion of the IgG1/IgG2a ratio was observed when the two injections were at either two or four week intervals ( Fig. 2A, B) . To confirm these observations, the cytokine mRNA pattern was analyzed in a qualitative multiplex RT-PCR assay in order to determine the Th1/Th2 profile. The experiment was carried out on total RNA extract from splenocytes in vitro re-stimulated with FIPV. The results showed the presence of IL-2, IL-12 and IFN-(Th1 type cytokines) but also IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 (Th2 type cytokines) mRNA in spleen cells of naive mice vaccinated once or twice with MVA-M (Fig. 3) . These data indicate a mixed Th1 and Th2 response in these animals which correlates with the production of both IgG2a and IgG1 antibodies, respectively.

This result indicates that the MVA-M expresses the FIPV M protein in vivo and is immunogenic. One of the drawbacks in using a recombinant virus is the immune response directed against the vector itself, that may preclude expression of the gene of interest. To gain information on this point, a group of mice was first primed with MVA, before being vaccinated with MVA-M. We observed that MVA-immune mice developed, after the MVA-M boost, FIPV-specific antibody titers equal to naive mice after a single MVA-M injection. These data support the idea that the vector is not neutralized. This is in accordance with what was reported with a recombinant MVA expressing the HIV-1 Env gene (Ramirez et al., 2000b) . Surprisingly, this mode of vaccination modified the T helper status of the response, since MVA-primed mice clearly showed a Th2-type response against FIPV, as evidenced by the predominant anti-M IgG1 antibodies and by IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 mRNA expression in splenocytes. But the most striking effect was that IFN-was no longer detectable by RT-PCR in wtMVA-primed mice, whereas this cytokine was expressed after vaccination of naive mice. These results confirm those of Ramirez et al. who reported a decrease of IFN--secreting CD8+ T cells in mice primed with MVA and boosted with MVAenv (Ramirez et al., 2000b) . Thus, these observations indicate that MVA is able to induce a Th2 environment by itself, hence predisposing the immune system to raise a Th2 response against co-expressed antigens.",

The latter could influence or decrease activation of Th1 cells since IL-18 acts in synergy with IL-12 to promote IFN-secretion (Okamura et al., 1998) . This interference could provide one explanation for the emergence of a Th2 environment and especially for inhibition of IFN-expression consequently to a poxvirus prime, despite the induction of IL-12 (Fig. 3) .

All the animals developed coronavirus-specific antibodies, demonstrating the effectiveness of the vector. However, despite the induction of a relatively high IgG response (titers of 1:1000 for animals vaccinated twice), none of the vaccinated cats survived after the lethal FIPV challenge. In the murine model, we observed that the number of MVA-M injections influences the Th1/ Th2 balance. However, in this cat trial, in terms of protection, no difference was observed between the two vaccinated groups.",

The lack of efficacy of our MVA-M might be explained by the difference of promoters between the constructions. In vaccinia WR and canarypox, the M gene expression was restricted to the early stage of the viral cycle. In MVA, the M gene is controlled by the modified PH5 promoter, which enables a strong expression during both early and late stages of the viral cycle. Early expression of an antigen by a poxvirus is known to induce a cellmediated immunity, whereas late expression favors the humoral immunity (Bronte et al., 1997) . Thus the late expression of the M protein by MVA-M explains the high FIPV-specific IgG response. These antibodies may have contributed to the pathology because FIPV is an immune-mediated disease. Although the M-specific antibodies do not enhance the virus entry into macrophages, they might have been involved in the formation of immune complexes, for example.",

The type of poxviral promoter seems to have a crucial importance to minimize the humoral response while eliciting an efficient cellmediated immunity. This type of immunity may be enhanced by a DNA vaccine prime as seen in other studies (Ramshaw and Ramsay, 2000) . Furthermore the M protein is apparently not sufficient to induce a protective immunity by itself, so it should be associated with other FIPV antigens that still have to be determined.",
