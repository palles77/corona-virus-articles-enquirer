The subcellular localization of 66 IFITMs is a key determinant of their antiviral profile. When expressed singly, IFITM3 and IFITM2 67 preferentially localize to early and late endosomes and lysosomes, and restrict viruses that enter via 68 these endo-lysosomal compartments. In contrast, IFITM1 primarily localizes at the cell surface and 69 can restrict viruses that enter through the plasma membrane [11-14]. Indeed, mutants of IFITM3 70 that lack an N-terminal endocytic sorting motif 20 YEML 23 localize to the plasma membrane and lose 71 their ability to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV), alphavirus and coronavirus infection by endosomal 72 routes [14-18]. 73 74 Studies focusing on IFITM3 restriction of IAV and Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) indicate that virus 75 internalization is unaffected by IFITM3 expression and, for SFV at least, the viral envelope 76 .

A549 cells stably expressing single mutants C71A, 282 C72A and C105A, the double C71A-C72A mutant and the triple C71A-C72A-C105A mutant were 283 generated.

For this, cells were metabolically labelled with a 'clickable' alkyne palmitate 286 analogue followed by further modification of the palmitoylated proteins via copper-catalyzed 287 azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction (i.e. 'click chemistry') using a TAMRA-labelled capture reagent.",

            "text": "30 previously demonstrated that microbat IFITM3 is antiviral. Here we show that bat IFITMs are 31 characterized by strong adaptive evolution and identify a highly variable and functionally important 32 site -codon 70 -within the conserved CD225 domain of IFITMs. Mutation of this residue in microbat 33 IFITM3 impairs restriction of four different virus families that enter cells via endosomes. This mutant 34 shows altered subcellular localization and reduced S-palmitoylation, a phenotype copied by 35 mutation of conserved cysteine residues in microbat IFITM3. Furthermore, we show that microbat 36 IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated on cysteine residues C71, C72 and C105, mutation of each cysteine 37 residue individually impairs virus restriction, and a triple C71-C72-C105 mutant loses all restriction, 38 concomitant with subcellular re-localization of microbat IFITM3 to Golgi-associated sites. Thus, we 39 propose that S-palmitoylation is critical for Chiropteran IFITM3 function and identify possess three interferon (IFN)-inducible IFITM genes -IFITM1, IFITM2 and 46 IFITM3 -encoding proteins with antiviral functions, and two IFITM family members that lack 47 antiviral function -IFITM5 and IFITM10. Mice have orthologs of all these IFITMs as well as two 48 additional genes, Ifitm6 and Ifitm7. Phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate IFITMs indicates that IFITM1, 49 IFITM2, IFITM3 group with murine ifitm6 and ifitm7 in a clade of immunity-related IFITMs (IR-50 IFITMs), with IFITM5 and IFITM10 falling as separate lineages [2]. IFITMs belong to the 51 CD225/pfam04505 or 'dispanin' protein super family (http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF04505) name suggests, IFITMs are membrane proteins, allowing them to police the cell surface and 56 endocytic membranes that viruses must cross to invade cells. Studies of IFITM topology suggest a 57 Type II transmembrane configuration with a cytosolic N-terminus, cytosolic conserved intracellular 58 loop (CIL) domain, transmembrane domain and extracellular (or intraluminal) C-terminus [4,5], 59 although there is evidence that other IFITM topologies exist [6-8]. The results of spectroscopic 60 topological studies agree with the Type II transmembrane configuration, as do bioinformatic 61 predictions of IFITM3 secondary structure that reveal three alpha helices, with the C-terminal helix 62 forming a single transmembrane domain [9,10]. The CD225 domain is highly conserved among 63 IFITMs and comprises an intramembrane domain (IMD) and CIL domain. The hydrophobic IMD 64 contains a 10-residue amphipathic helix (amino acid residues 59-68 of human IFITM3) that is glycoprotein undergoes low pH-induced conformational changes [14]. However, for both viruses, 77 the viral core components are not delivered to the cytoplasm, suggesting that membrane fusion 78 fails. Experiments with IAV indicate that hemifusion (i.e. lipid-mixing between viral and cellular 79 membranes) can occur in the presence of IFITM3, but the subsequent formation of a fusion pore is 80 inhibited [13,19]. IFITM3 modulation of membrane cholesterol, leading to a decrease in membrane 81 fluidity, has been implicated in the inhibition of fusion [20]. Recent work has shown that IFITM3-82 positive vesicles fuse with incoming virus-bearing vesicles before hemifusion, and that IFITM3 83 enhances the rate of virus trafficking to lysosomes [21]. The co-localization of viral cargo with 84 IFITM3-positive endosomes is specific to restricted viruses, suggesting that IFITM-insensitive 85 viruses such as Lassa virus enter via different endosomal compartments and thereby escape IFITM 86 engagement and restriction [13,21]. Further examples of virus specific IFITM action include the 87 ability of murine IFITM6 to restrict filoviruses, but not IAV [22], and amino acids within the IFITM3 88 CIL domain that are preferentially needed for IAV but not Dengue virus restriction [23]. Other post-89 entry mechanisms for IFITM3 restriction have also been proposed [24-26]. 90 91 IFITMs are heavily regulated by post-translational modification (PTM). One major modification is S-92 palmitoylation, a reversible 16-carbon lipid PTM that increases protein hydrophobicity and 93 influences the behavior of proteins in membrane environments [27]. For human and murine IFITM3, 94 S-palmitoylation can occur on cysteine residues 71, 72 and 105 and enhances IFITM3 antiviral 95 activity [28,29]. Recent live-cell imaging showed that abrogating C72 palmitoylation slowed IFITM3 96 trafficking to membrane compartments containing IAV particles [21]. Multiple zinc finger DHHC 97 domain-containing palmitoyltransferases (ZDHHCs) can palmitoylate IFITM3 with marked 98 functional redundancy, although ZDHHC20 may be particularly important [30]. For human IFITM3, 99 C72 is also the dominant site for acylation [31]. Three other PTMs have also been reported, all of 100 which negatively regulate IFITM3 antiviral activity: ubiquitination on one or more of four lysine 101 residues [28], methylation on K88 [32] and phosphorylation on Y20 [15,16]. IFITM3 antiviral activity 102 is also dependent upon oligomerization, which requires amino acids F75 and F78. In tissue culture 103 systems at least, IFITM3, IFITM2 and IFITM1 can hetero-oligomerize and restrict viruses in a 104 cooperative manner, with the extent of cooperativity and redundancy between IFITMs varying for 105 different viruses [21,23]. However, the biochemical mechanisms and molecular determinants by 106 which IFITM proteins restrict virus infection are still far from clear. 107 108 In mice and humans, there is evidence that IFITM3 influences host antiviral resistance. Ifitm3 36] and in humans single nucleotide polymorphisms in IFITM3, that may act by defense in these species and in shaping host range. Phylogenetic studies have shown 115 that the IFITM gene family is evolutionarily conserved and characterized by gene duplication, copy 116 number variation and the presence of pseudogenes [2,45]. Whereas humans possess a single IFITM3 117 gene, a remarkable multiplicity of IFITM3-like genes exists in the genomes of some other primates; 118 for example, there are 25 IFITM3-like variants in the marmoset and eight in the African green 119 monkey [2,46]. Interestingly, several of these variants contain N-terminal polymorphisms which, 120 when inserted into human IFITM3, prevent ubiquitination and endocytosis, however the function of 121 these duplicated IFITM3-like genes has not been tested [46].",

Flow cytometry was used to 205 determine the proportion of infected cells following single cycle infection and a representative 206 experiment of three independent experiments is shown(Fig. 3A-C).

In contrast, mbIFITM3 P70W was 209 significantly less restrictive than wt (35% ZIKV infection at an MOI of 10 and 7% at an MOI of 1)(Fig. 210 3A).

In fixed and 223 permeabilised cells, wt huIFITM3 and mbIFITM3 had a punctate intracellular distribution, as 224 described previously [5,39], and huIFITM3 P70W showed a similar localization (Fig. 4). In contrast, 225 mbIFITM3 P70W showed a different distribution, with prominent perinuclear Golgi-like labelling 226 (Fig. 4A, permeabilised). When cells were labelled in the absence of detergent (Fig 4A, intact), some 227 wt huIFITM3 was detected at the cell surface, as reported previously, and this was similar for 228 huIFITM3 P70W. The strong cell surface labelling seen for wt mbIFITM3 was much reduced for 229 mbIFITM3 P70W (Fig. 4A, intact), suggesting reduced trafficking to the plasma membrane. To 230 examine IFITM3 trafficking to the cell surface, cells were incubated in medium containing anti-HA 231 mAb at 37\u00b0C for 60 min prior to fixation with or without permeabilization (Fig. 4B) to reveal 232 internalised or cell surface anti-HA antibodies, respectively. In cells expressing huIFITM3s, similar 233 intracellular punctate labelling was observed on permeabilized cells, suggesting that equivalent 234 trafficking to the cell surface and subsequent endocytosis occurred for both wt and huIFITM3 P70W. 235 Consistent with this, similar levels of cell surface labelling were seen for both proteins on intact 236 cells. Significant intracellular labelling (permeabilized cells) and cell surface labelling (intact cells) 237 was seen on cells expressing wt mbIFITM3, but very little internal or cell surface staining was seen 238 for cells expressing mbIFITM3 P70W. Together, these data indicate that the P70W mutation in 239 mbIFITM3 significantly reduces trafficking of the protein to the cell surface and, as a consequence, 240 there is little subsequent endocytic uptake of the protein into endosomal compartments. 241 242As our initial observations suggested mbIFITM3 P70W may be preferentially associated with Golgi 243 compartments(Fig. 4A), we co-labelled fixed and permeabilised cells with anti-HA mAb (to detect 244 the HA-tagged IFITM3 protein) and markers of intracellular organelles.

Therefore, we assessed S-palmitoylation levels of wt 256 and codon 70 mutants of hu and mbIFITM3 using a protocol based on the acyl-PEG exchange (APE) 257 method developed by Percher et al. [31,56] in which we used Maleimide-functionalised biotin to 258 selectively substitute S-acylations (Fig. S3A). Treatment of these samples with streptavidin induces 259 a mass shift of the biotinylated proteins detectable by western blotting (Fig. S3B). Thereby the 260 intensity of the shifted band correlates with the amount of S-acylated protein. Whole cell lysates 261 from IFITM3-expressing stable A549 cells were subject to the acyl exchange workflow (Fig. S3A) and 262 streptavidin treatment. Following SDS-PAGE and anti-HA western blotting, a band was observed 263 that migrated at ~75 kDa (Fig. 5), which is consistent with the expected size of one streptavidin (MW 264 ~60 kDa) bound to one IFITM3-HA (MW ~15 kDa). Hence, this band represents S-palmitoylated 265 IFITM3 present in the A549 cell lysates. The high MW band was dependent both on the presence of 266streptavidin and the addition of NH 2 OH(Fig. S3B). Furthermore, titrating streptavidin showed that 267 the amount used in this study was non-limiting(Fig. S3B). Blurred bands at higher MW above the 268 predominant 75 kDa band(Fig. 5, Fig. S3B) likely represent binding of additional streptavidin 269 molecules to the second and/or third cysteine residue. Therefore, the entire area at and above the270 75 kDa band was used for the densitometric analysis. Triplicate lysates for each cell line were 271 subjected to acyl exchange, independent SDS-PAGE and anti-HA blotting. Densitometry was then 272 performed in Image J to determine the proportion of each IFITM3 protein that was S-palmitoylated 273 i.e. (HA signal \u2265 75 kDa)/(total HA signal in lane) (Fig. 5). The mbIFITM3 proteins showed a lower 274 degree of S-palmitoylation compared to huIFITM3. Among the codon 70 mutants, IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated on C71, C72 and C105",

            "text": "290 labelling) used in this study reveals that both approaches have different informational value. The 291 acyl exchange method only enables the quantification of the total amount of palmitoylated IFITM3. 292 Due to the multivalency of the streptavidin, multiple PTMs might still result in a 1:1 ratio of the 293 IFITM3:streptavidin complex if the corresponding sites are in close vicinity. However, due to the 294 significant shift of the IFITM3:streptavidin complex, palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated IFITM3 295 can be quantified in the same blot thereby facilitating an internal normalization. The metabolic 296 labelling approach enables the quantification of all palmitoylation sites, as each PTM contributes 297 directly to the total TAMRA fluorescence intensity. However, for quantitative analysis, the TAMRA 298 fluorescence must be normalized to the HA blot signal to account for variation in IFITM3-HA 299 expression (Fig. 6B) leading to larger error bars. The different informational value becomes obvious 300 in the case of wt huIFITM3 and wt mbIFITM3. While the TAMRA fluorescence for wt huIFITM3 was 301 greater than for wt mbIFITM3 and huIFITM3 P70W (Fig. 6B), the acyl exchange result did not show a 302 significant difference in the proportion of palmitoylated protein in either case (Fig. 6A). Hence, the 303 total amount of palmitoylated IFITM3 is equivalent in all three cases, however, the results of both methods for the different cysteine mutants of mbIFITM3 showed 307 that the single cysteine mutants (C71A, C72A and C105A) have reduced palmitoylation compared to 308 wt mbIFITM3, with a greater reduction for C72A than C71A. A double C71A-C72A mutant still 309showed some acylation, indicating that C105 can be acylated, while the triple mutant abrogated 310 palmitoylation(Fig. 6A, B). In summary, our data show that, as with human and mouse IFITM3, 311 microbat IFITM3 can be S-palmitoylated on each of the three cysteine residues, with C72 being defective cysteine mutants of mbIFITM3 phenocopy the P70W mutation316    We next studied the ability of the mbIFITM3 S-palmitoylation defective cysteine mutants to restrict 317 viral entry. The infectivity of ZIKV, SFV and virus pseudotypes expressing the envelope proteins of 318 the lyssaviruses West Caucasian Bat Virus (WCBV) and Lagos Bat Virus (LBV) was tested in cells 319 expressing either wt mbIFITM3, mbIFITM3 P70W or the cysteine mutants of mbIFITM3(Fig. 7). All 320 cysteine mutants showed impaired restriction relative to wt mbIFITM3, with a predominant pattern321 of greatest restriction by C71A > C105A > P70W > C72A. The double (C71A-C72A) and triple (C71A-322 C72A-C105A) mutants showed no restriction relative to control cells. This is consistent with S-323 palmitoylation being greatest for C71A and abrogated for the triple cysteine mutant (Fig. 6), 324 indicating that palmitoylation positively regulates the antiviral activity of mbIFITM3. For 325 comparison, wt huIFITM3 and huIFITM3 P70W were also tested in lyssavirus entry assays. As seen 326 earlier for ZIKV, SFV and IAV, the huIFITM3 P70W protein restricted lyssavirus entry as potently was performed on stable A549 cells expressing the HA-tagged 330 versions of the different mbIFITM3 cysteine mutants. All single Cys mutants, as well as the double 331 and triple mutants showed preferential perinuclear localization and a reduction in the more widely 332 distributed punctate localization characteristic of wt mbIFITM3 (Fig. 8A, permeabilized). The 333 intracellular redistribution correlated with reduced exposure of IFITM3 at the cell surface (Fig. 8A, 334 intact). This was most marked for the double and triple cysteine mutants, which localized almost 335 entirely to perinuclear sites and showed minimal cell surface staining above the background of 336 untransduced cells. Of the mbIFITM3 point mutants, C72A had the most extensive perinuclear 337 localization, correlating with it showing the greatest loss of restriction(Fig. 7). The perinuclear 338 expression of the P70W mutant was as prominent as that seen for C105A and C71A, but for all three 339 a proportion of cells expressed some IFITM3 at the cell surface and more widely within the cells(Fig. 340 8). As seen for mbIFITM3 P70W, the perinuclear IFITM3 co-localized with the cis Golgi marker 341 Giantin(Fig. 8B)and with the trans Golgi network marker TGN46(Fig. S2B).342 343In sum, our results show that S-palmitoylation is necessary for viral restriction by microbat IFITM3 344 and that when S-palmitoylation is reduced, either directly by targeted cysteine mutation or 345 indirectly via the P70W mutation, reduced restriction occurs concomitantly with IFITM3",

IFITM3 is a critical component of antiviral immunity in vivo in humans and mice. However, 354 its role in other species and its mechanism of restriction is not fully understood. Comparative inter-355 species genomic analysis is a powerful tool to understand host-pathogen interactions since genes 356 and molecular determinants that function in host defense carry evolutionary signatures of adaptive 357 evolution [62]. Here, we included Chiroptera in evolutionary analyses of mammalian IR-IFITMs and 358 identified strong adaptive evolution on the branch leading to bat IFITMs. Functional studies showed 359 that codon 70, that exhibits extensive amino acid diversity among mammals, affects the antiviral 360 activity and S-palmitoylation of mbIFITM3 and, furthermore, that S-palmitoylation is crucial for 361 antiviral restriction by mbIFITM3 and has a marked effect on its subcellular localization. 362 363 Analysis of lineage-specific selection pressures revealed a strong signature of adaptive evolution on 364 the branch leading to the Chiropteran IFITM clade. This is not a general feature of Chiropteran 365 genes as, for example, the bat TLRs evolve under purifying selection [63], and evidence for positive 366 selection is only seen in 1% of nuclear-encoded genes [64,65]. Importantly, the adaptive evolution 367 we identified in bat IFITMs suggests that they serve an antiviral role in vivo, and that at least some 368 bat viruses must have exerted major fitness costs on their hosts. Instances of virus-induced disease 369 in bats have been reported [66-68], and the high viral richness per bat species [47] indicates that 370 they harbor an exceptionally large number of viruses. Notably, Chiroptera harbor a greater variety 371 of flaviviruses, bunyaviruses and rhabdoviruses than any other mammalian order [47], all of which 372 are RNA viruses restricted by IFITM proteins.",

            "text": "387We therefore chose to investigate the effects of amino acid diversity at this site and, to do so,388 substituted P70 in human IFITM3 with each of the other residues which occur naturally in functional 389 mammalian IFITMs (A, T, G, W, F, V). None of these mutants differed from wt in restricting three 390 different viruses IAV, SFV and ZIKV. An earlier report also showed that substituting P70 of human 391 IFITM3 with T, the residue present in human IFITM2, did not alter IAV restriction or subcellular 392 localization [23]. Our study isolated the effects of six different codon 70 residues within the 393 background of human IFITM3, but does not exclude the possibility that these residues might have 394 functional consequences in the context of different IFITMs or against other viruses. 395 396 To investigate the function of codon 70 in Chiropteran IFITMs, site-directed mutagenesis was 397 performed on IFITM3 of the microbat M. myotis, since this is the only Chiropteran IFITM reported to 398 act as a restriction factor [39]. A P70W substitution was made because tryptophan is common 399 among the functional mammalian IFITMs in our phylogenetic analysis and was inferred as a possible 400 ancestral codon (although the ancestral state reconstruction was ambiguous at the tree root). 401 Microbat P70W showed reduced restriction of IAV, SFV (Alphaviridae), ZIKV (Flaviviridae) and two 402 lyssaviruses, concomitant with re-localization to perinuclear Golgi-associated sites and reduced S-403 palmitoylation. As for mbIFITM3 P70W, S-palmitoylation-defective cysteine mutants of microbat 404 IFITM3 showed markedly different localization from wt, with reduced expression at the cell surface 405 and retention at Golgi-associated sites. Based on evidence that restriction relies on the localization 406 of IFITM proteins at sites of viral entry [13,14,21], altered localization of the mbIFITM3 P70W and 407 cysteine mbIFITM3 mutants likely explains their reduced restriction of viruses that enter through 408 endosomes. However, whether deficient S-palmitoylation leads to altered localization or whether 409 altered localization prevents the proper enzymatic processes of microbat IFITM3 S-palmitoylation 410 remains to be seen. The 23 different human ZDHHC palmitoyltransferases localize to various 411 different cellular sites including the early secretory pathway (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] and Golgi 412 apparatus), plasma membrane and endocytic vesicles [74]. McMichael et al. have suggested that 413 the location at which IFITM3 is palmitoylated may influence its activity, since they found -to-alanine mutants of human and murine IFITM3 showed no change in 419 localization [31]. Thus, S-palmitoylation may positively regulate the antiviral activity of human, 420 murine and microbat IFITM3 via different mechanisms, including effects on protein-protein 421 interactions, IFITM3 conformation, membrane tethering/targeting, or the interplay with other 422 PTMs [27,31]. As for human and murine IFITM3 [31], our data indicate that C72 is the major site of S-423 palmitoylation in microbat IFITM3 with C72A showing the most profound defect in restriction. 424 Single mutation of each of C71, C72 and C105 reproducibly impaired restriction by microbat IFITM3 425 in stable A549 cells, indicating that each of these S-palmitoylation sites contributes to antiviral 426 function. In contrast, C71A and C105A did not significantly impair the antiviral activity of murine 427 IFITM3 and human IFITM3 respectively [31], although transient transfection and a differences, either in the mechanisms or site-specific effects of S-palmitoylation 431 on human and microbat IFITM3, may explain why the P70W mutation in human IFITM3 did not alter 432 its phenotype. Alternatively, quantitative differences may be responsible: huIFITM3 P70W was 2-433 fold less S-palmitoylated in our metabolic labelling experiments than wt huIFITM3, but still more S-434 palmitoylated than wt mbIFITM3. More S-palmitoylations on human compared to mb IFITM3 might 435 enable wt huIFITM3 to tolerate some reduced S-palmitoylation (e.g. with P70W), perhaps 436 suggesting a threshold level of S-palmitoylated IFITM3 is needed for restriction. 437 438 Codon 70 is located within a short unstructured portion of the IMD, 69 NPCC 72 in human and 439 microbat IFITM3, which separates two alpha helices [9]. The S-palmitoylated C71 and C72 residues 440 are highly conserved among IFITMs as well as the larger dispanin protein superfamily [3]. The other 441 residue flanking codon 70, N69, is also strongly evolutionarily conserved in IFITMs (Fig. 2B) and 442 thought to be specifically required for proper termination of the amphipathic helix [9]. It is unlikely 443 that the phenotype of our codon 70 mutant relates to disruption of the amphipathic helix comprised 444 by residues 59-68, since mutations in IFITM3 that destroy the amphipathic helix, including complete 445 deletion of the helix, are S-palmitoylated at wild type levels and localize normally [9]. The residue at 446 codon 70 might affect the accessibility of C71/C72 for acylation, or its cytoplasmic facing position 447 could enable interactions with ZDHHCs, themselves transmembrane proteins with cytosolic DHHC-70 lies within a short stretch of amino acid residues which is only present in the 452 vertebrate DSPA proteins and no other dispanin superfamily member [3], consistent with a role 453 mapping to the antiviral function that resides uniquely in some DSPA members. 454 455 Why such diversity has evolved at codon 70 among mammalian IFITMs is unclear. It may reflect the 456 diversity in IFITM-modifying ZDHHCs among different species or differentially regulated S-457 palmitoylation of different IR-IFITMs in the same species to ensure successfully coordinated 458 antiviral action in host cells. Alternatively, diversity at codon 70 may have evolved due to 459 differences in the magnitude or type of virus-induced selection acting on different hosts. 460 Addressing these possibilities will require a range of different residues to be systematically tested in 461 their cognate IR-IFITMs and host cell background against a range of viral targets, and for the 462 pleotropic cellular effects of IFITM expression to be similarly analyzed [26]. The literature on the 463 viral and cellular roles of IFITMs has remained largely discrete, although it is important to consider 464 how these roles co-exist and are regulated, particularly in light of the therapeutic potential of 465 IFITMs as antivirals. The recent report that IFITM expression inhibits placental and fetal 466 development by preventing trophoblast cell fusion highlights a novel, non-infectious, selective 467 pressure that may oppose that of antiviral defense to shape IFITM evolution and regulation [77,78].468Such reproductive-based selection pressure likely varies between mammals according to species' 469 fecundity, life history traits and placental physiology and, interestingly, may be another driver from 32 mammalian species were used for phylogenetic analysis(Fig.1), including 475 three species of megabat and ten species of microbat. IFITM sequences were derived either from 476 our transcriptional analyses or by tBLAST searches of NCBI nucleotide and EST databases using 477 human IFITM3 and IFITM1 as queries. For inclusion in phylogenetic analysis, genes identified via 478 BLAST had to have a CD225 domain, intact ORF of ~ IFITM size and 2 exons. IFITM genes were 479 cloned from primary fibroblasts from the microbat species M. myotis, the FLN-R cell line derived 480 from microbat E. fuscus (kindly provided by Prof Martin Beer, Friedrich Loeffler Institute) and the 481 pig NPTr cell line, using RACE and RT-PCR methods as previously described [39]. The P. alecto alignment was performed using multiple runs of the MAFFT procedure [79] at 489 different stringencies as available in the Geneious package [80]. Sequence alignments were 490 constructed for (i) 148 mammalian IFITM genes (alignment = 347 nt in length) and (ii) 31 functional 491 IFITM genes (alignment = 384 nt in length). In the case of the 148 gene sequence alignment, all 492 unaligned and ambiguously aligned regions were removed using GBlocks [81,82], leaving 347 nt for 493 analysis. Alignments are available from the authors on request. Maximum likelihood phylogenies of 494 data sets were inferred using PhyML [83], employing the General Time Reversible (GTR) model of 495 nucleotide substitution and a gamma (\uf047) model of among-site rate variation with a of clade-specific and codon-specific selection pressures 499 To assess selection pressures acting on IFITM genes (Sup. Table 1), we computed the relative 500 numbers of nonsynonymous (d N ) and synonymous (d S ) nucleotide substitutions per site (i.e. the 501 ratio d N /d S ) among the 31 functional IFITM genes using both the SLAC (Single-Likelihood Ancestor 502 Counting) and FUBAR (Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation ) programs as implemented in 503 the Datamonkey webserver (http://datamonkey.org), employing default settings [84,85]. To assess 504 the nature of selection pressures on the branch leading to the Chiropteran IFITMs we utilized the 505 aBSREL (adaptive Branch-Site Random Effects Likelihood) model available on Datamonkey [55]. 506 507 Cloning of microbat IFITM3 genes 508 RACE was conducted as described previously [39] on primary cells from P. hastatus and C. 509 brevicauda. Based on RACE-derived sequence the following primers were designed to amplify full 510 IFITM3 genes by PCR: P. hastatus: 5'-AGGAATCCGCTCTGTGTAGGG-. PCR performed on genomic DNA confirmed the presence of an 513 intron. Genes were assigned as IFITM3 based on having a long N-terminus and double 514 phenylalanine motif (F8/F9), as previously [39]titrated by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells [87].

Cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained for representation of the workflow used for acyl-biotin exchange [adapted from [31]]. 813 Cell lysates were reduced with Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and free Cys residues were 814 capped with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), preventing them from further reaction. Thioester bonds 815 were subsequently cleaved with hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) to remove S-acyl groups before liberated 816 cysteines were alkylated with biotin-maleimide (Biotin-Mal). Thus S-palmitoylated proteins were 817 selectively biotinylated and subsequently selectively bound by streptavidin. After streptavidin 818 treatment, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot, enabling the 819 detection of both unmodified and S-palmitoylated proteins.

            "text": "The antiviral responses of bats (mammalian order Chiroptera) are of particular interest because 124 these animals have been increasingly recognized as reservoir hosts from which numerous viruses 125 have ultimately emerged, with severe pathogenic and socioeconomic consequences in humans and 126 livestock. Indeed, a recent analysis showed that bats host a significantly higher proportion of 127 zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders [47]. Moreover, Chiroptera are the only order that 128 harbor significantly more zoonotic viruses than would be predicted from reporting effort and host 129 traits such as geographic range and mammal sympatry. It is possible that this propensity to be 130 reservoirs for a large number of viruses, many of which may remain asymptomatic, in part reflects 131 aspects of bat immunology [48-52]. Hence, the study of Chiropteran antiviral effectors, such as 132 IFITMs, can potentially reveal mechanisms of viral tolerance as well as the evolutionary signatures 133 of virus-host co-evolution. We previously showed that microbat IFITM3 retains sequence motifs for 134 endocytosis and PTM, traffics to the plasma membrane before endocytic uptake, co-localizes with 135 endosomal markers and, at normal expression levels in primary microbat cells, inhibits infection by Here we performed evolutionary analyses of mammalian IFITMs, including those identified from 139 bats, to shed light on IFITM function and the nature of past selection pressures, and to identify key 140 amino acids for experimental studies of IFITM function. Phylogenetic analysis of Chiropteran IFITM genes 145 Viral restriction activity is conserved in microbat IFITM3 [39]. However, Chiropteran IFITMs have not 146 been included in previous phylogenetic analyses, even though bats comprise ~20% of all 147 mammalian species. Accordingly, we first analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of IR-IFITM gene 148 sequences from 32 eutherian mammal species including 13 species of bat. The genes analyzed were 149 identified either via tBLAST or from our cDNA analyses (rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) 150 on cells from Myotis myotis, Eptesicus serotinus and Sus scrofa, and proteomics informed by 151 transcriptomics [53] for Pteropus alecto). The resulting phylogeny revealed relatively high levels of 152 sequence divergence (nucleotide substitutions per site) between the IFITM genes (Fig. 1). Notably, Chiropteran IFITMs formed a monophyletic group separated from other taxa by a relatively long Adaptive evolution on the branch leading to the Chiropteran IFITMs 157 The IFITM gene family is notable for gene duplications, variation in copy number and the presence 158 of pseudogenes [2,54] and our previous tBLAST searches identified multiple IFITM-like genes for 159 many species. In most cases, there are little data to differentiate functional from non-functional 160 IFITM-like genes. Therefore, to assess possible selection pressures, we performed phylogenetic 161 analysis on a selection of mammalian IR-IFITM genes for which there is evidence of function 162 (Supplementary Table 1): this data set comprises 31 IFITMs from 17 species, including 8 Chiropteran 163 species (Fig. 2A). The selection pressures acting on these IFITM genes were assessed using the 164 numbers of nonsynonymous (d N ) to synonymous (d S ) nucleotide substitutions per site, with d N >d S 165 indicative of positive selection (i.e. adaptive evolution), using the adaptive Branch Site REL method 166 (aBSREF; [55]) that is able to determine selection pressures acting on specific branches of the input 167 phylogeny. This analysis revealed that 6.8% of the codons in the sequence alignment were strongly 168 positively selected on the branch leading to all Chiropteran IFITMs, with a d N >d S of infinity (LRT = To visualize amino acid diversity, a logo diagram was constructed for the alignment of 31 173 'functional' IFITMs. This revealed notable amino acid diversity at codon 70, located within the 174 otherwise highly conserved CD225 domain and directly upstream of the double cysteine motif",

Using the SLAC (counting) method, codon 121, within the C-terminal IFITM 187 domain, was the only site identified as under significant positive selection (p<0.1; mean d N -d S value 188 of 2.64). Although there was no statistically significant evidence for positive selection on codon 70 189 (p = 0.192), it had the second highest d N -d S value of any site (1.91), with 14 non-synonymous 190 nucleotide changes (compared to 13.5 at codon 121) and only two synonymous changes across the 191 phylogeny. Similar results (i.e. close to significant positive selection) were obtained using the 192 FUBAR (Bayesian) method.Codon 70 affects antiviral restriction by microbat IFITM3195To assess the functional effects of variation at codon 70, polyclonal stable A549 cells were made 196 expressing C-terminally HA-tagged wild type (wt) human IFITM3 (i.e. huIFITM3 P70) and human 197 IFITM3 encoding each of the other 6 amino acids that occur naturally in mammals at position 70 (i.e.",

It has been suggested that basal activation of the Chiropteran IFN system [71] limits viral replication 377 and enables disease tolerance [72], and our findings indicate that bat IFITMs serve an adaptive 378 function and may contribute to this mechanism.
