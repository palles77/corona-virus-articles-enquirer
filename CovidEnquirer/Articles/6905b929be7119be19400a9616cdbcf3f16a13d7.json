There are many personal or community risk factors which affect health status, and medical care is a vital aspect of the broad spectrum of health needs. Despite its value, medical care by itself is not sufficient to produce a high standard of population health. In order to promote optimal health, effective populationlevel prevention methods as described in previous chapters, availability of and access to care must be seen in the context of the individual and of societal conditions that increase the risk of disease, and application of appropriate measures to reduce those risks to prevent disease and promote health. Some of those interventions are provided by medical care and its preventive aspects. Other key aspects include social, sanitary, environmental, legal, economic, and educational factors. This interrelates with human resources for health (Chapter 14) , financing and economics (Chapter 11), organization (Chapter 10), technology, law, and ethics (Chapter 15), and global health (Chapter 16).",

            "text": "Most industrialized countries have implemented national health programs such as health insurance systems or national health services. Each system developed in the political, social, and historical context of the country and continues to evolve. Developing countries are also struggling to achieve universal access to care and health for all by expanding primary health care and social security plans which provide benefits to workers and for certain vulnerable populations, primarily mothers and children. As they move up the scale of economic development, developing countries also address the problem of how to decrease morbidity and mortality, achieve equity in access to health care, and expand the funding basis for health care through national health insurance. Some countries are experiencing rapid economic development but lag behind in directing increased national wealth towards improving health status. This is often due to a lack of focused political commitment, trained policy analysts, and trained public health professionals (see Chapters 14 and 16). Each national health system has its own characteristics and challenges. System management requires continuous evaluation based on well-developed information systems, trained health management personnel, and societal involvement through professional organizations and advocacy groups. There is no defined \"gold standard\" plan for providing universal access to health care that is suitable for all countries. Each country develops and modifies a program of national health appropriate to its own cultural needs and available resources. However, there are evolving sets of patterns in health care, so that countries can and do learn from one another (Box 13.1).",

Removing financial barriers to care is necessary but not sufficient for optimal health and to address the health problems of an individual and of a society. Equity in financial access with universal coverage is vital to population and individual health since anyone can have serious illness at any time, and long-term preventive care is essential to good public health standards and quality health care. Inequalities exist in all societies but many have successfully reduced them by poverty reduction, job creation, education, and many other systems that reduce interregional, socioeconomic, and demographic differences in health. Special attention to high-risk groups in the population is essential. Groups may be based on age, gender, occupation, risky lifestyle, location of residence, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, economic status, or other factors that increase susceptibility to disease, premature death, or disability. Services should be based on need and not only demand, which can escalate costs by overservicing or, in effect, selective servicing of those with insured access and the knowledge, time, and capacity to make use of a health system. Health systems planning needs to promote access on patient assessment, but also those services that reach the entire population, especially people at high risk who are often least able to seek appropriate care.",

Workmen's compensation and other benefits were extended in 1871 to many workers in other industries, such as those in domestic service, workers in mines, factories, and quarries, and seamen. Bismarck's 1883 compulsory health insurance legislation was intended to improve the health of workers and their families, and especially of potential army recruits, as well as to stave off the political advancement of the social democratic parties.

In the period between the world wars, national health insurance programs were developed in many countries in the industrialized world.

It was compulsory for all wage earners between the ages of 16 and 70. These workers made payments along with their employers and a state contribution. This two-part plan provided a contributory system for unemployment insurance and for medical care against illness for workers and their families. General practitioners (GPs) were paid on a capitation basis rather than a salary, preserving their status as self-employed professionals. Initially this plan covered onethird of the population, but coverage increased to one-half by 1940. Administration was through approved mutual benefit societies (friendly societies), some based on insurance companies and others founded by professional associations and trade unions.

Between 1980 and 1990, because of the DRG payment system and HMOs or managed care systems, which promote alternatives such as home and ambulatory care, hospital utilization was reduced in the USA. While total costs of health care increased during this period, without the reduction in hospital utilization the increase would have been considerably higher.",

Medicare and Medicaid waivers also allow states to include these beneficiaries in state health plans, but universal access to care would require enabling legislation in Congress. At the same time, conservative attacks on public programs such as Medicare keep the issue of national health insurance on the public agenda.",

The movement to managed care became an avalanche in the 1990s, with a high percentage of the population insured at their workplace becoming members of HMOs or other forms of managed care. The swing to managed care produced major effects in the health care system, not only for doctors increasingly pressed to join HMOs or PPOs, but also for hospitals and for the consumer who had to adjust to the rules of managed care. Restrictions on access to specialists and new procedures generated public and political criticisms leading to a decline in enrollment from 1999 to 2005, with an increase in 2006, but this economically driven changeover has had profound effects on the US health system.",

This plan provided free hospital care for all residents of the province on a prepaid basis under public administration.

It established district health systems in rural areas in order to strengthen services and attract health personnel and their families to remain in these areas rendering more comprehensive and integrated services. This model integrated the organization of hospitals, nursing homes, home care, preventive services, and medical practice, reaching many of the rural areas of the province over the next decades. This evolved into the regional health systems model. Following the 1970s' Castonguay-Nepveau Commission Report, Quebec implemented Community Health Centers (CLSCs) throughout the province. In the 1990s, Saskatchewan began development of similar integrated district health service and regionalized hospital systems. Other provinces have since followed suit, each using a unique formula to regionalize and consolidate services, and increase the provision of services in the community setting. Ontario, the economically largest province, but the last to regionalize, recently introduced 14 local health integrated networks to manage services to its 12 million inhabitants.",

The FHSA is responsible for contracting with GPs, general dental practitioners, optometrists, and community pharmacists. The role of FHSAs expanded to include formulation of policies, supervision of facilities and services, and remuneration of contracting providers. Patients register with GPs and are referred to hospitals and specialists in accordance with medical needs. GPs have traditionally been paid on a capitation basis for the patients registered with them, and the patient has the right to change GP. Capitation is the allocation of funds per person registered as a service beneficiary for a specified period to cover care for a range of services. Weighted capitation is allocation per person, with adjustments made for factors such as age, gender, and regional standardized mortality rates (SMRs), which reflect both need and demand for health services. SMRs are used as a proxy for morbidity in capitation allocation (see Chapter 3). GPs are paid extra premiums for performance indicators; for example, specific preventive services such as immunization, Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, and mammogram screening. In 2008, a pay-per-performance program called Advancing Quality was introduced in 24 NHS hospitals in the Northwest of England (population 6.8 million), and a clinically significant reduction in hospital mortality was observed compared to other hospitalized populations in other regions; the largest reduction was observed for heart diseases and especially for pneumonia (1.9 percentage points) (Sutton et al., 2013).",

GPs are increasingly working in health centers, along with district public health nurses. By 1995, about one-third of GPs worked as fundholders with per capita payment by the NHS for ambulatory and hospital care. This empowered GPs to negotiate with the hospitals, reduce waiting times, and improve other health care conditions for their patients, placing the hospital in the position of having to compete for the referral work of the GP. Experiments with financing of hospital care through the GPs were designed to raise the quality of care and promote cost containment.

Primary care is provided in health centers staffed by salaried GPs, nurses, and other staff serving about 15,000 clients, but about 12 percent is provided by private physicians. Sweden has a system of economic equalization to compensate for uncontrollable factors such as age differences and rate differences for certain costly disease conditions. Sweden has traditionally had a very high ratio of hospital beds to population. In 1985, this included 4.6 acute care beds, 6.2 long-term care beds, and 2.4 mental hospital beds per 1000 population. The acute care beds were reduced to 2.0 per 1000 by 2010. Hospitalization was a common form of care, especially in areas with a sparse population and long distances to hospitals and doctors. Reduction in hospital bed supplies has been a long-term strategy in Sweden since the 1940s, and emphasized since the 1960s, with a steady reduction in medical, surgical, and community care beds, as well as psychiatric beds. Long-term social care for the elderly has been transferred to social service agencies.

The system is still primarily based on the Semashko model with the addition of national compulsory health insurance. The reforms suggested are wide in scope, from primary care to hospital reformation. The wide gaps between Russia and other former socialist countries, and especially countries of Western Europe, are primarily in the sector of NCDs and injuries which share common risk factors, underlying social and cultural determinants and opportunities for intervention. These are, in particular: high blood pressure, tobacco consumption, alcohol binge drinking, obesity, and especially low fruit and vegetable consumption and physical inactivity. These factors account for most of the disease burden, with highest rates among the poor, rural, and vulnerable. Improving health for the people of the CIS countries requires an emphasis on the detection and management of hypertension and risk factor reduction. Increased funding in health care should be directed to primary care and the hospital sector should be downsized and upgraded to adapt to the underlying determinants and risk factors of NCDs and injuries. Since 2006 there have been trends towards improvement but dedicated reform is needed to close the gap with other countries in Europe. In terms of NCD mortality among the OECD countries, Israel recorded the seventh lowest rate of ischemic heart disease, the lowest stroke mortality rate, and the second lowest male cancer mortality rate, but ranked only 18th out of 34 with respect to female cancer mortality.

Additions to the obligatory basket of services, such as new medications and diagnostic tests, are made by a multiprofessional team coordinated by the Ministry of Health on an annual basis. Co-payments for specialists, diagnostic testing, and pharmaceuticals are a source of cost-sharing. People receiving welfare do not pay co-payments and the elderly population pays 50 percent of the quarterly ceilings. Attendance at well-baby clinics is free. However, there are no subsidies to low-income groups, resulting in inequalities in access to health care. The Sick Funds are accountable for the services rendered. Most hospital beds are operated directly by the Ministry of Health, although several large hospitals are run by the largest Sick Fund, Clalit Health Services. The government wishes to transfer government hospitals to independent trusts, to operate as economic units able to allocate funds internally and compete for clients, with payment on a DRG basis, but various economic and other considerations have delayed this transition. Regionalization of services will be difficult to achieve in the present configuration of the NHI law because each Sick Fund has its own regional organization.",

Studies by the Israeli Road Safety Authority show widespread non-adherence of drivers with speed limits. On the positive side, the creation of speed-reducing roundabouts/traffic circles and increased police enforcement have led to traffic calming and increased safety in cities such that, on the whole, Israel has reduced fatal motor vehicle accidents by nearly 50 percent over the past two decades, from 525 in 1990 to 287 in 2012.",

In addition, there are 59 tertiary health facilities operated by the states. The number of tertiary and specialized hospitals suggests that there is a relatively good average availability of highlevel services. In 2000, there were 3275 secondary carelevel facilities in the public sector, a population-to-facility ratio of around 135,000 people per facility supplemented by 3000 facilities in the private sector.

Data on Nigerian doctors legally migrating overseas are scarce and unreliable, but estimates are that hundreds of Nigerian-trained doctors continue to migrate annually.

Doctors are attracted to university teaching hospitals rather than employment by states because the salaries are far higher in the federal establishments than in state employment. Almost half of Nigerian doctors choose to work in Lagos in federal health institutions. A unified salary scale for doctors in both state and federal government employment should be implemented to motivate doctors to stay in the state of origin or local governments to render services, because that is where they are most needed.

In the same period, the infant mortality rate fell from 100 to 88 deaths per 1000 live births in 2010. Recent interventions including Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses that reflect the underlying causes of child deaths have contributed to these successes. However, these need to be rapidly expanded and accelerated if Nigeria is to achieve MDG4. Nigeria has had striking success in almost eradicating polio, reducing the number of cases by 98 percent between 2009 and 2010. However, a climate of insecurity and violence in parts of Nigeria threatens the solid programmatic advances in polio eradication in Nigeria made in recent years. Maternal mortality fell by 32 percent, from 800 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2003 (then one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world) to 545 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2008, but rose to 630 in 2010. However, the proportion of births attended by a skilled health worker has remained low and threatens to hold back further progress. An innovative Midwives Service Scheme is expected to contribute substantially to ongoing shortfalls but its impact has yet to be reflected in the data. If the scheme is expanded in proportion to the national gap in the number of midwives, this will further accelerate progress. In addition, more mothers will be covered by antenatal care as access to quality primary health care improves and incentives attract health workers to rural areas (Nigeria MDG Report, 2010).",

Reduced hospital bed supply has become part of standard health reforms in industrialized countries as more efficient care is achieved through better diagnostic facilities, ambulatory care, and other community-based services and facilities, including not-for-admission outpatient surgery, home care, and day care. There is also a wide recognition that hospitals are vital for short-term acute care, but themselves are health risks from infections and there are incidents that relate to errors, infections, disorientation of patients, and the discomfort of being away from the family environment. Because the elderly are greater consumers of health services than the young, another major factor that influences this ratio is the age distribution of the population.

This set of rights is also sometimes in conflict with the imperative of cost control and the rapid increase in availability of new innovations in diagnosis and management whose benefits may be limited and costly, preventing other proven measures from being implemented.

This was stimulated and promoted by the Health Field Concept (Marc Lalonde, 1974) , the Alma-Ata Conference on primary health care (1978 and 2000) , and the WHO's Health for All concept (1978) . Specific health targets in the USA (Healthy People 2010 and Healthy People 2020) and in the European Region of the WHO (1985 and place emphasis on measurable objectives as the basis for health planning, affecting the planning process (see Chapter 2). Even the most developed countries have substantial population groups living in poverty, with poor health conditions. The 1990s was a decade of major reforms in national health systems. Industrialized countries attempted to restrain cost increases while retaining universal access. Sweden has brought down its health expenditures by reducing hospital bed supplies. The USA, building on its social security-based health insurance plan for the elderly and the poor since 1965, has brought health care to a large sector of the elderly and poor population. Many attempts have failed to bring in universal coverage as national health insurance, but the country is undergoing dramatic changes in the managed care revolution, with health insurance coverage by public and private insurance systems working under regulations to protect individual rights, and propelled by the need to control the rate of cost increases. In the USA about three-quarters of working-age adults on low incomes, an estimated 40 million people, lack any or adequate health insurance (Commonwealth Fund, 2012) . The Obamacare plan, implemented over the years 2013-2015, is expected to lower private insurance costs and improve conditions for many who were excluded from medical insurance coverage by prior medical conditions. This is a major new health reform. Understanding the international experience of health care systems is essential for policy development to promote international standards and criteria for health systems development. The Canadian Medicare program is about 70 percent funded from the public sector through general taxation of the federal and provincial governments. As the federal government has withdrawn from its earlier levels of participation, the provinces struggle to support the comprehensive range of services and increasing costs associated with an aging population, increasing professional fees and costly health technology. The federal Medical Care Act is limited to sharing provincial costs for physician and hospital services, leaving many essential service programs to provincial funding alone.",

The quality of the health protection community infrastructure (sewage, water, roads, and communication), the quantity and quality of food, levels of education, and professional organization are all parts of this continuum. Narrow planning for health systems ignores this message at the risk of missing its targets of improved health indicators, such as those adopted by the UN as the MDGs, and control of the burden of NCDs and injuries. National health systems are not only a matter of adequacy and methods of financing and assuring access to services; they address health promotion, national health targets, and adaptation to changing needs of the population, the environment, and a broad intersectoral approach to health of the population and the individual. The structure, content, and quality of a health system play a vital role in the social and economic development of a society and its quality of life.",

The former socialist countries have gone through painful periods of transition. Many countries have developed free-market systems with dynamic growth in national economies. Health systems have struggled to adapt but great gains in longevity and reduced mortality from preventable diseases have been made in many countries. Public and private donor partnerships have emerged to help the poorest countries to cope with overwhelming health problems of HIV, TB, malaria, diarrheal and respiratory diseases, and the vaccine-preventable diseases.",

It does not, in itself, guarantee achievement of important health targets. A system of national health must be able to allocate resources to meet the needs of those with the highest risk of early disability or death, and not simply be a payment system for doctors and hospitals. The issue of changing demographics and epidemiological challenges must also be addressed. For global health, universal access to health care despite all its difficulties is a basic goal that must be achieved.",

Measures taken included improving capacity in disease prevention and control, including improved control of HIV/AIDS, schistosomiasis, and hepatitis B. The Health Ministry has undertaken action to prevent occupational and endemic diseases, strengthen maternal and child health care, and promote development of community health services. Other measures include deepening health system reform and allocating health resources rationally, better regulating pharmaceutical production/products and the market, and fostering a modern traditional Chinese medicine industry (WHO, 2005) .In 2001 insurance coverage was very low, with some 60 percent of total health expenditure being out of pocket. Health care is mostly on a fee-for-service basis, but fees and salaries are set artificially low so that drug sales and tests provide alternative income for facilities and providers. Hospitals are managed as profit-making enterprises, rather than for the public good. Public health and information systems are particularly weak, as seen during the SARS crisis (World Bank, 2011) . For the tens of millions in the countryside, health provision is patchy, with poor access and rampant corruption causing social discontent. China's Health Ministry has announced a plan to reform the health system and provide a national service for all citizens, including the rural population. The Healthy China 2020 program would provide a universal national health service and promote equal access to public services, with some comparisons being made with the NHS in Britain.Between 2003 and 2011, national insurance coverage reportedly increased from 23 percent to 90 percent, accompanied by increased service utilization, particularly in rural areas: the participation rate in the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme had reached 96 percent. Employee health insurance, medical insurance for urban residents, and rural cooperative medical and hospitalization cost insurance have increased their reimbursement levels. However, benefits are not portable across regions, which is a concern for migrant populations and migrant workers (WHO, 2011).China's recent 11th and 12th Five-Year Plans (2006 -2015 respectively stress rebalancing the economy from export at all costs to promotion of domestic consumption and promoting quality of life and reduced inequalities. There is also stress on protecting the environment.
