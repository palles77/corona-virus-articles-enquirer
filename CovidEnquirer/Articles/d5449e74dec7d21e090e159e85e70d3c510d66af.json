At the same time, to meet the medical requirements and reduce the flow of patients to the skin clinic, we began free online and telephone consultation by providing free dermatology consultations. Dermatology outpatient department in West China Hospital was scheduled to run on January 28, 2020, mainly for critical care patients. Patients who had made an advanced appointment for getting medical service but chose not to visit received a full refund of registration fees. The number of dermatology outpatient clinics has been drastically reduced from eight to four, and only one accompany person is allowed to enter the clinic. People entering the outpatient and inpatient buildings must wear masks, and get their body temperature monitored by professionals wearing tight protective clothing. At the entrance of the building if anyone having fever (body temperature \u226537.3\u2103), travel history to Wuhan in last two weeks, clear contact with residents in Wuhan in last two weeks, or contact with people having fever would be directly sent to the fever clinic for screening, hereafter exposed are quarantined for 2 weeks, and potential exposures are also asked to quarantine themselves for 2 weeks at home. During the skin clinic, patients are not allowed to take off their masks except on indications of facial lesions. Doctors must wear masks, surgical caps, protective suits, gloves and goggles at work, and take off their protective equipment only after their work to a designated disposable area.",
