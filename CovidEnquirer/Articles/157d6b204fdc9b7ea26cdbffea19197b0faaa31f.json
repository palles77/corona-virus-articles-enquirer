Susceptibility or resistance to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) 1 may be controlled by a single genetic character. In turn the genetic resistance of the Call mice to MHV Princeton strain (PRI) may be overcome by a change in the virus and we here report the sudden regularly produced change of MHV(PRI) which is incapable of killing resistant C3H mice or their macrophages to one which regularly kills both the macrophages and the host mice. In the preceding paper (1) we demonstrated that even though resistant cells adsorb the virus, the virus does not develop a fullblown infection in the C~-I system; further, it remains infectious only for the original mouse (PRI) cells even after it has been resident in the resistant (C3H) cells for some 100 hr.",

It is clear from the studies here reported that destruction of resistant cells by a high multiplicity of the wild virus is uniformly associated with the emergence of a new strain of the virus MHV(C~H) which in low dilutions is virulent for C3H cells and young adult C3H mice. It may then be asked whether the original MHV(PRI) virus itself has any effect on the C3H cells. In a later paper, we examine some factors influencing the conversion of MHV(PRI) virus from C3H-nonvirulent to C3Hvirulent virus. 2 1 Abbreviations used in this paper: MHV, mouse hepatitis virus; pfu, plaque-forming units; PRI, Princeton strain mice; TCIDs0, tissue culture infective dose, median.",

When fluids from the destroyed C3H cultures were passed to new C3H cells, destruction was not delayed but occurred within 2-3 days, and the end point of destruction rose markedly. This suggested that the virus replicated when very large amounts were added to the cells. It was then puzzling to find that the same virus concentrations did not form plaques on C3H macrophage monolayers prepared with an overlay (3) . Therefore, the agar overlay was witheld from a series of C3H monolayers for different intervals after they were inoculated with M H V ( P R I ) and incubated at 37\u00b0C (Table II) . Plaques then clearly developed when the agar overlay was witheld for 20 hr or more. With increased time, more plaques developed but this was perhaps because the virus had replicated and spread to other cells before they were covered with the agar. (Table II) .",

In favor of the selection of a constantly occurring true mutant is the fact that different stocks of virus differed in the tendency to give rise to the variant, and that a real decrease in the appearance of the variant was produced by cloning the original. A search was therefore made in the MHV(PRI)-infectious material for some factor which would increase the conversion of wild virus to the variant. When UV-irradiated MHV(PRI), reduced in the titer by 100-fold, was put on C3H macrophages or was combined with low multiplicities of nnirradiated virus before putting it on macrophages, no destruction occurred.

In the studies of ontogeny of resistance of C~H mice by Gallily et al. (8) , a virus which was capable of killing C3H cells and mice did indeed appear after the virus MHV(PRI) had been grown in baby mice of the genetically resistant strain. However, no attempt to characterize this variant or to analyze the factors responsible for its emergence were made. In this present study the same or a similar variant appeared during the first passage on the resistant cells, but only if the cells were given large inocula of virus and if the cells were destroyed.",

In the present instance one might argue that C3H cells are continually resistant to MHV(PRI) and that only when, under some yet unknown conditions, the virus is converted to the MHV(C3H) type does the resistant C3H host or its cells succumb. However, recent unpublished work by D. O. Willenborg et al. on a cortisone-induced change in the susceptibility of C~H mice (9) weighs heavily against this explanation. On the other hand the report by Kantoch and Bang (10) that resistant cells in culture may be made more susceptible by the addition of an extract of susceptible cells can also be interpreted as an increase in the capacity of these resistant cells to produce virus which is capable of killing resistant cells.",

In favor of a host-dependent step in the emergence of the variant MHV(C~H) is the fact that the variant appeared much more frequently in C~H cells which remained continually exposed to air than it did in C~H cells which were covered by an agar overlay. Subsequent unpublished work on this same system by Lavelle et al. has demonstrated that the environment of the C~H cultures has a marked effect on the susceptibility of the resistant C,~H cells.",

It was cloned on C3H macrophage monolayers and killed both adult PRI and C3H mice when injected intraperitoneally. This new variant was antigenically indistinguishable from the wild type virus. While the emergence of the variant virus was delayed in the course of infecting C~H macrophages with large inocula of MHV(PRI), the second passage grew to a high titer in both cell types without delay. Thus, adaptation to the new host was immediate. Interference, apparently not interferon-mediated, between the two variant viruses may have been the cause for the delay in the emergence of the variant virus. The delayed destruction of C3H-cultured macrophages by large inocula of MHV(PRI) uniformly resulted in the emergence of MHV(C3H). Whether the new variant emerged as a result of a selection of a pre-existing stable mutant or was conditioned by \"growth\" in the resistant host was not determined.",
