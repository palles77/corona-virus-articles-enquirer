            "text": "Population discontent with the health care system has led to major reforms. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factor Study 2010 1 demonstrated that age-standardized years of life lost (YLL) in China were lower in 2010 than all emerging economies in the G20 and only slight higher than those noted in the United States. With the lowest years lived with disability rate in the G20 in 2010, China ranked 10th for healthy life expectancy and 12th for life expectancy. 2 In spite of a mainly urbanized and aging population, and important health threats from infectious outbreaks, reproductive health problems, and health inequality, China has, nonetheless, been on track to reach the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 by 2015, respectively, in the reduction of child and maternal mortality rates. 3 Several other factors characterize the distinctive nature of the Chinese health care system, including its unique history, vast infrastructure, the speed of health reform, and economic capacity to make important advances in health care. 4 With incomplete insurance coverage for urban and rural dwellers, uneven access, mixed quality of health care, increasing costs, and risk of catastrophic health expenditures, China advanced the Healthy China 2020 initiative to encourage disease prevention, health promotion, health care service delivery, expand pharmaceuticals, and promote health care coverage. 4, 5 The Chinese dream is an extremely popular slogan that refers to the realization of a prosperous and strong country with rejuvenation, sustained well-being, and health care reform.",

With government ownership of the health care system, bold preventative measures were implemented to treat and prevent infectious diseases and integrate Western and traditional Chinese medicine while health services were provided in urban government-funded hospitals and village and township rural clinics. Communes that owned the land, organized and distributed its harvest, supplied social services, and provided health care by a cooperative medical system. Staffed by practitioners with basic training, so-called barefoot doctors met the basic needs of the rural populations. 7 The second or Cultural Revolution phase, from 1966 to 1976, coincided with university and medical school closers for 5 years sending students and faculty to work in the countryside. The third or Early Reform phase, from 1977 to 1989, heralded a period of rapid economic expansion associated with decentralization of political and economic power and opening China to the global economy. There were many well-coordinated health initiatives, such as the control of vectors 7, 8 to diminish infectious diseases, prevention of infant mortality, and increased longevity, whereas chronic cardiac, cancer, cerebrovascular, and mental illness arose as major causes of death and disability. From 1952 to 1982, infant mortality decreased from 200 to 34 per 1000 live births and life expectancy increased from 35 to 68 years, reflecting major investments in public health through a centralized government modeled essentially after the Soviet Union system. 9 Disturbing policies, such as one Younger child per family, along with the accelerated aging of the population and the movement of rural workers to urban areas led to a demographic shift that further exacerbated disparities between the wealthy and impoverished classes. Several decisions leading up the dismantling of its apparently successful health care and public health system in the early 1980s preceded the fourth and final phase of Late Reform, from 1990 to 2002, associated with the reigning in of health care costs.",

This practice led to a rapid overall increase in health care prices and spending available only to the wealthy through outof-pocket payments. A third factor was the sudden and complete dismantling of communes that privatized the Chinese agricultural economy separating rural citizen from their cooperative medical systems, removing nearly 900 million Chinese peasants from risk pools and a health safety net. Barefoot doctors, unemployed, switched to more lucrative activities. A final factor was the decentralization of the public health system, which, encumbered by reductions in public funding as a proportion of local public health revenues from 60% to 42%, completed the partial privatization of China's public health system. 10 ",

Although guided by a market Health Care in China approach, the central government has responded to growing public criticism for affordable access to health care services with greater financial risk protection from outof-pocket spending on health services. Funding for health care in China derives from several newly enacted governmental sources. 12 They include subsidies to rural and urban residents not covered by the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) program through the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) or the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance Program (URBMI), respectively. With a goal of increasing funding to cover at least 75% and 50% for hospital admissions and outpatient services, more than 96% of the population is covered together by NCMS, URBMI, and UEBMI. There has been a parallel increase in governmental health service coverage for hospital payments. Primary health care providers receive governmental funds to deliver a package of basic health services. Health care providers and government-appointed hospital officials, motivated by profits and behavior similar to other for-profit organizations, have been incentivized to prescribe excessive and high-tech diagnostic tests and to prescribe pharmaceuticals to earn profits for later distribution. In 2011, expenditures on drugs accounted for 43% of total health expenditures, 12 nearly triple the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OCED) average of 16%. With providers permitted to charge a 15% markup on pharmaceuticals, and public hospital profits tied to utilization of services, there is neither the motivation nor the incentive to find cost-effective approaches to health care service delivery focusing on aspects of disease prevention, health promotion, and disease management or a more functional coordination between primary, secondary, and tertiary health care providers.",

This system has led to artificially high price schedules, overpayment for pharmaceuticals, overuse of expensive high technologic testing, increase in health costs, and an erosion of professional ethics and practice norms. 15 Ethical codes for medicine in China have been based on principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice; however, in recent years the potential for conflicts of interest has undermined ethical relations between medical professionals, researchers, drug companies, and even regulatory agencies. 16 The Chinese government has piloted new ways of dealing with misdirected provider financial incentives, including the change from fee for service to aggregated and prospective payments for performance and treatment protocols that assure improved quality and emphasize prevention and primary care of chronic disease in place of curative services more appropriate to infectious illness. In 2005, the Ministry of Health (MoH) piloted a new system of primary care funding of providers that separated revenue and charges 17 and another payment reform pilot in 2005 in which CHCs were paid fees for service according to a government price schedule and distinct health bureaus that were given a yearly budget subject to end-year reassessment. Preliminary results showed that such pilots were associated with a reduction in per-visit outpatient expenditures. There are fewer pilot programs for provider payment methods in villages where health care workers are the main source of prevention and primary care for rural residents. However, their situation differs in that the motivation to dispense drug prescriptions, including antibiotics and intravenous injections, for simple health problems, is the return to their net income. Whereas inpatient services have typically been billed based on the utilization of services, so-called case-based systems of payment have been piloted based on payment rates for each disease in its International Classification of Diseases code, with expenditure caps or a prospective budget to reduce incentives for providers to increase volume or transfer expenditures to nonintervention cases. 18 ",

Notwithstanding, the quality of care in rural communities is generally inferior to that of its urban counterparts because of inadequately trained professionals, leading to relative underuse of rural services and overuse of urban ones. Such gaps in wealth, financial and physical access to care, and governmental and public health expenditures have had a differential effect on children less than 5 years of age and maternal mortality.

The investigators noted that about two-thirds of doctors and nearly all nurses were educated up to junior college only despite a massive expansion of medical education countrywide. There was significant inequality in the distribution of both doctors and nurses within provinces that varied with respect to health outcomes, which in some cases showed that the density of health workers was linked to rates of infant and maternal mortality.",

Those with low income received lower health system coverage than those with higher incomes but had an increased probability of either not seeking health care when ill or undergoing catastrophic medical spending. With mortality analysis showing a parallel transition in the major causes of death in the past 3 decades in China from communicable diseases and maternal and perinatal infectious conditions to noncommunicable chronic diseases, respectively accounting for 41% in 1973% and 74% of mortality in 2005, there was a staggering pace of increased age-standardized mortality of 10% from noncommunicable disease between 1991 and 2000. 22 Modification and prevention of behavioral risk factors, diet, hypertension, obesity, tobacco use, and the response to chronic disease have, thus, claimed center stage in China. Xiao and Kohrman 23 suggested integrating medical anthropological solutions in conjunction with legislation banning smoking in public places, uniformly high cigarette prices, and tobacco advertising bans 24 in arriving at a solution to tobacco use in China citing that smoking has been encouraged in Chinese society among men as a means of development, both economic and personal. 25 Since 1978, after China adopted reform policies and opened up to the global community, the medical care system and health of residents have improved. Nevertheless, the main orientation of health care reform in the 1980s and 1990s was to render autonomy to government-owned public hospitals without contribution of public expenditures. With the emergence of for-profit privately owned hospitals, health care expenditures increased along with disparities between urban and rural areas and different provinces increased at the expense of health care coverage and access to services for most of its citizens, most of whom were the poorest. By absorbing and integrating experiences domestically and abroad, the new guidelines for China's health care reform have addressed core issues of equity and accessibility with strong public support. 26 According to Chen, 27 China's 2009 plan for health care reform marked the first phase toward achieving comprehensive health coverage by 2020. There are 5 essential components: first, systematic reform and affirming the government's role in wide medical research coverage for more than 90% of Chinese citizens; second, a national essential-drug system to meet the basic needs for treatment and prevention of diseases and to ensure safety, quality, and supply; third, improved grassroots-level medical care, with emphasis in rural areas on infrastructure and human resources in a 3-tier network at county, town, and village levels, and urban CMCs to alleviate overcrowding in city hospitals and foster a gatekeeper system led by family doctors and nurses; fourth, promotion of basic public health services; fifth, pilot program reforms to direct substantial increases in public investment, restricting of hospital management, and correction of commercialization and skewed financial incentives.",

Other elements of active purchasing might contribute to improved outcomes in health services in China. With most patients continuing to receive treatment in government-owned facilities, the private sector has grown more rapidly than the public sector, especially in rural areas because many village clinics have been sold or taken over by individuals. With at least one government-owned township health center and other private clinics in each village area, the government has called for policies on subsides, taxation, and price setting for hospitals whether for profit or not or government or nongovernmentally owned. Basic medical insurance based on medical saving accounts combined with a social risk-pooling fund have been rolled out in urban communities, whereas the NCMS cooperative medical scheme, combining household contributions with central and local government subsidies, has been available since 2003. In 2013 a new health department, the national health and family planning commission (NHFPC), was established, merging with the MoH to improve medical and health care services and to deepen institutional reform in the medical care and public health sectors. 29 Tian and colleagues 30 conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2011 of 12 randomly sampled counties and 118 villages in China using indicators to assess coverage, equality, and effectiveness of rural public health services noting the most difficulties in noncommunicable disease management, especially in those with the lowest incomes. Implementation of health care reform to rectify access to public health services, which increased from 2008 to 2009, has still not corrected significant interregional and intraregional inequalities in health care access.",

Reformed for the public's interest, public and private collaboration might be further expanded after an objective assessment of its effect on China's health policy goals.
