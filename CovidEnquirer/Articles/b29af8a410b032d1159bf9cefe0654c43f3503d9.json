Overall, 50% (95% CrI: 43, 58) of the population was infected, with 22% (95% CrI: 5, 46) of infections acquired in households and 40% (95% CrI: 23, 56) being asymptomatic.

We also investigated how such transmission studies, describing the clustering of symptomatic individuals in households, might be used to estimate other key epidemiologic parameters such as the proportion of asymptomatic infections. However, to be able to perform these assessments, we must first address a number of challenges and limitations inherent to our study design: the nonspecific nature of Zika symptoms means that 1) identified secondary cases might be unrelated to ZIKV infection; 2) fully asymptomatic ZIKV infections remain undocumented; and 3) because households necessarily include at least 1 symptomatic case (the index case), attack rates in the study might overestimate attack rates in the general population. We show how these challenges can be tackled with a statistical and modeling framework that integrates data sets documenting different aspects of this epidemic.",

From December 2015 to October 2016, household contacts of laboratory-confirmed ZIKV cases included in the CARBO cohort in Martinique University Hospital were recruited for a household transmission study. Laboratory confirmation of recent ZIKV infection was performed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing (Real-Star Zika Virus reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction kit 1.0; Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) of serum or urine, or by direct detection of immunoglobulin M against ZIKV in serum (French National Reference Laboratory for arboviruses in Marseille, France). Immunoglobulin M antibodies were captured with rabbit antihuman immunoglobulin M antibodies (Interchim, Montlucon, France).",

A number of factors could explain such variations. The risk of developing symptoms following infection might vary by population, for example, because of genetic factors. Age and sex might also affect the probability of asymptomatic infection (37) , and thus the study population can explain some discrepancies. The variations could also be partly explained by differences in case definitions. For example, in Yap Island a symptomatic case was defined by an acute onset of generalized macular or papular rash, arthritis or arthralgia, or nonpurulent conjunctivitis (4), which is slightly different from the definition used in the present study. Other factors could also explain these discrepancies (e.g., the study designs or the way data were collected). These factors might have a larger effect for pathogens like ZIKV, whose symptoms are mostly mild. With an overall attack rate of ZIKV infection of 50% (95% CrI: 43, 58), this study suggests that about a third of the population in Martinique experienced symptoms due to ZIKV infection.",

First, the reporting of Zika-like symptoms by household members was done retrospectively, sometimes several months after the household inclusion. Thus, recall bias is likely in this study, particularly given the mild symptoms associated with Zika disease. This might have led to overestimating the proportion of asymptomatic infections. However, our estimate of the proportion of asymptomatic infections is at the lower end of those found in the literature, and it seems unlikely this proportion could be much below 40%. The imperfect follow-up of households also means that reported dates of symptom onset in household contacts are likely to be too imprecise to be used for inference (20, 32) . As a consequence, we developed a statistical framework that did not use this information but relied only on the total number of cases per household. Second, it is possible that symptoms reported when Zika circulation was low were more likely related to another cause than were those reported around the peak of the outbreak. Such disparities between households included at different times during the epidemic could have an impact on estimates. However, we have shown in a sensitivity analysis that results remained stable when the analysis was restricted to the households recruited between February and October 2016. Finally, for a mild disease like Zika, with nonspecific symptoms, the definition of a symptomatic case can have an impact on the estimated proportion of asymptomatic infections.",

We also estimated that 78% (95% CrI: 54, 95) of infections were acquired from the community, which can limit the impact of within-household prevention measures. This study also highlights the importance of joint analysis of multiple data streams collected during an outbreak to get more insight on key epidemic features.",
