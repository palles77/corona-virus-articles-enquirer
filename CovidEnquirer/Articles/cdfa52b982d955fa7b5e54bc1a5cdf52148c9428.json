Most Little is known about the pathology of these animals and few articles have been published, mainly concerning their important role as wild reservoir hosts for severe infectious diseases of domestic animals and human beings. A 4-year-old, female Asian palm civet was found dead by the owner. At necropsy, large amount of adipose tissue was found in the subcutis and in the peritoneal cavity. Most of the pancreas appeared red, translucent. Hepatomegaly, discoloration of the liver were evident, with multifocal areas of degeneration, characterized by white nodular lesions. Histologically, the pancreas showed severe interstitial and perilobular necrosis and extensive haemorrhages, with separation of the interstitium, mild reactive inflammation at the periphery of the pancreatic lobules. Liver showed multifocal foci of vacuolar degeneration, lipidic accumulation, sometimes associated to hepatocyte necrosis. A diagnosis of acute severe hemorrhagic-necrotizing pancreatitis (or acute pancreatic necrosis) associated with pancreatic and hepatic lipidosis was made. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first case report of acute lethal pancreatitis in an Asian palm civet. Although the exact cause of the disease remains undetermined, a hypothesis of the cause and pathogenesis is discussed, pointing out dietary indiscretion and consequent overweight as possible important risk factors.

Multifocally, small vessels showed fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall and were surrounded by numerous erythrocytes. Multifocal aspects of fat necrosis were also evident in the surrounding adipose tissue. At the periphery of the pancreatic lobules, beside areas of liquefaction, there were features of early modifications of the parenchyma, consisting of small foci of coagulative necrosis, where acinar cells appear shrunken and acidophilic. Duct system, endocrine pancreas, centrilobular parenchyma, as well as large vessels and nerves, were spared. In the spared portions of pancreatic parenchyma, and within the islets of langerhans, multifocal haemorrhages and scattered single or small clusters of round cells, with large clear cytoplasm and central nuclei (lipidic macrophages) were found (Figure 1, right inset) . The presence of these cells and lipidic accumulation also within the acinar cells was confirmed by red oil staining on frozen sections (Figure 1 , left inset).

A more wide veterinary and human literature was then considered to discuss the possible causes underlying the observed pathological features, also considering that inflammatory lesions of the exocrine pancreas are not as common in domestic animals as in humans [17] . Although pancreatitis has occasionally been reported in a number of animal species (most dogs and cats), information on causal factors is sparse and incompletely understood [15] .",

Obesity has been considered a predisposing factor for acute pancreatitis in both human and animals [15, 18] , often associated with pancreatic steatosis and a worse prognosis [19, 20] . Recent studies in human medicine demonstrated that obesity can act creating an environment that favours the induction and the progression of pancreatic disease by a promotion of inflammation and inhibition or deregulation of autophagy [20] . Despite the relative frequency of acute pancreatitis in human beings, the precise underlying mechanisms are unknown. Experiments on animal models were indispensable in providing insight in pathophysiology and treatment of acute pancreatitis [21] . In this respect, particular attention should be paid to the diseases of these animals, since palm civet would represent a potential suitable model for the study of some important human conditions, such as diet-induced pancreatitis.",

Indeed, the diets used for these animals are not specific, often adapted from commercial diet designed for other species. In the present case, the civet was kept in a closed enclosure and mainly fed with dry cat food, with two times per week raw egg, and rarely chicks, mice and rats. Considering their natural habits [1, 13, 22] , the diet of Asian palm civets should include a major percentage of fruits. Furthermore, hepatic lipidosis was also observed, a lesion described as a consequence of pancreatitis in cat and often related to a worse prognosis when associated with concurrent acute pancreatitis [16, 23] . Noteworthy, two animals were kept in the same environments, fed with the same food, but only one developed the disease. This would let to suppose that other concomitant risk factors and/or a specific predisposition could have played a role. Inherited alterations in genes encoding pancreatitis enzyme or their inhibitors, as described at the basis of the human hereditary or idiopathic pancreatitis, could have not been ruled out. A condition characterized by homozygosis for a mutation in the lipoprotein lipase gene and hyperlipoproteinemia has been recently described in young mink, representing a valid model for the study of the corresponding human hyperlipoproteinemia type I [17, 24] .",
