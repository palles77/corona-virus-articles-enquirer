Although the recommendation systems can find customer groups that have similar interests as target customers, brand new products often lack ratings and comments. Similarly, products that are less often purchased, such as furniture and home appliances, have fewer records of ratings; therefore, the chances of being recommended are often lower. This research attempts to analyze customers' purchasing behaviors based on product features from transaction records and product feature databases. Customers' preferences toward particular features of products are analyzed and then rules of customer interest profiles are thus drawn in order to recommend customers products that have potential attraction with customers. The advantage of this research is its ability of recommending to customers brand new products or rarely purchased products as long as they fit customer interest profiles; a deduction which traditional market basket analysis and collaborative filtering methods are unable to do. This research uses a two-stage clustering technique to find customers that have similar interests as target customers and recommend products to fit customers' potential requirements. Customers' interest profiles can explain recommendation results and the interests on particular features of products can be referenced for product development, while a oneto-one marketing strategy can improve profitability for companies. q",

In the recommendation modules, products not yet purchased or rarely purchased can still be recommended to customers with little inaccuracy. This mainly attributes to the research based on products purchased in the past, thus the recommendations are not likely to miss products out.",

Then each group's CV is obtained, and finally the weighted CV is calculated to compare the level of member concentration of the two approaches. The weighted mean value is the number of members in a group times the group's CV divided by total numbers of data for obtaining more objective mean value.",

When the customer enters the system again, the movie will be ranked lower. Since the feedback weight setup is different due to different business, it would also affect the precision and learning effect of recommendation systems. Therefore, procedure 2 will test and find the better feedback weight. This part of the experiment mainly focuses on the repeated testing of different weight b; therefore, the 928 data from the 30 testing objects in the previous procedure will be used again to simulate their behaviors through the feedback weight on b \u00bc 1:1; 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5. Each testing object and each b is tested three times to observe the system's learning ability at different feedback weight. Calculation of recall is expressed by treating the data provided by the testing objects as the denominator to represent the transaction records. The numerator is the number of movies that are recommended by both the testing objects and the recommendation system. For instance, if customer 1001 has 30 movies on transaction records, and 20 of the movies are the same as recommended by the system, then the recall is 20/30 \u00bc 0.6667. Procedure 3 of the experiment will test whether modules that combine customer profiles and customer cluster profiles work better than the one with sole profile. The experiment group is the module that combines customer profile and customer cluster profile while two comparison groups are formed.

The test is conducted online, user behaviors are observed from 05/11/03 to 05/18/03. Detailed procedures are shown in Fig. 12 , where the system will determine for users, which recommendation module to enter according to user account. In addition, since user interests may change anytime, the user's group may be changed accordingly. To make the clustering results closer to the most recent behavioral pattern, while considering online real-time clustering analysis may lead to customer's impatience due to the long wait, the system will batch customer clustering to achieve the optimal customer clustering results.",

Online experiments are conducted in procedure 3 with b \u00bc 1:5 in a hope to effectively filter out users' non-interested movies without neglecting users' potential interests by filtering out too many movies. In the experiment group, each of the 47 testing objects has an average of 2.6 visits to the website. Thirty-two persons have visited the website three times or more, which is 68.1% of the total testing objects. Six people have visited only once, which is 12.8% of total. The remaining nine testing objects have visited the website twice. In comparison group 1, the customer profile module, 47 testing objects' average visit is 2.4, and the 29 testing objects have visited three times or more, which is 61.7% of total. Ten people have only visited once, which is 21.3% in total. The remaining people have visited twice. In comparison group 2, customer cluster profile module: 35 people have visited the website three times or more, and four people have visited only once, yet the remaining seven persons visited twice. Table 11 is the comparison of system recommendation precision during each visit for testing objects who visit the experimental website three times. As Fig. 15 shows, as the number of visits increases, the system precision also increases, which demonstrates that the system has the mechanism to learn customer behavior. Such a learning mechanism is more obvious in the results on experiment group, since it combines two recommendation modules and allows the system to learn user interests and behaviors more effectively. When a testing object visits the website for the second time, experiment group's precision is significantly higher than those of comparison groups. When a user visits the website for the third time, the precision becomes as high as 0.7857, which is 31.9% higher than that of comparison group 1 and 30% higher than that of comparison group 2. Fig. 15 also demonstrates when a user paid his first visit, the precision of experiment group is still higher than those of the comparison groups. This is possibly because the comparison group only adopts one recommendation module to come up with top 10 movies, while experiment groups use two recommendation modules to recommend five movies each; a total of 10. The overall average precision is the highest, meaning that the top five movies cover more user interests, achieving higher precision than top 10 movies. This demonstrates that the system is effective when calculating the recommendation scores. Table 12 shows the comparisons of average precision, recall and F1 measures in procedures 3 and 4, in terms of experiment group, comparison group 1, comparison group 2, and general recommendation area. Fig. 16 has demonstrated that the experiment group has the highest precision, with comparison group 2 being the next, general recommendation being the lowest. Comparison group 2 has higher precision than comparison group 1, attributing to comparison group 2's adopting of group recommendation, which recommends movies of interests among other customers, who are similar to target customers. Movies in this field tend to be more persuasive with peer recommendation. Customers tend to trust other customer's recommendations; therefore, its precision can also be assumed higher.

When the customer has obvious interests toward specific features, such as casts or directors, this module then has performance that is more obvious in recommendation.",

The experiment group and the two comparison groups are one-to-one marketing, and the general recommendation area is of mass marketing. It can be discovered from Figs. 16 and 17 that mass marketing achieves lower performance regardless of precision and recall. General recommendation is not of personalized recommendation, and same popular movies are recommended to all users. This approach does not have mechanisms that learn user behaviors, thus recommended movies only represent popular tastes and not individual interests. General recommended movies are only updated periodically and this may only have higher precision for the first time recommendation. Once a user visits the website again in a short timeframe and discovers the same movies are still recommended, the interests will become lower, which decreases overall precision and recall. Fig. 18 uses F1 measure to include the considerations of precision and recall, which also demonstrates that general recommendation methods perform worse than other personalized recommendation systems.",

Recently, the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has stimulated and revived some E-commerce, which proved its importance. Many companies have constructed websites and started Internet businesses. To save customers' the effort to search for a product, as well as increase customers' loyalty, the recommendation system can truly serve as a mechanism to retain customers. The recommendation system of this research is constructed on a web-based system, mainly combining two recommendation systems, individual customer profile module and customer cluster module. Customer profile module mainly aims to discover a customer's potential interests based on product features, and customer cluster module finds peers of the same interests as target customers. The total amount spent by customers on a particular product is used as a clustering input variable in order to eliminate the disadvantages resulted by overdetailed spending amount, including too many or too scattered dimensions and slow speed. The research is based on movie data, and the result shows that the combined module functions better than just one module. In addition, the result also demonstrates that two-stage clustering can really cluster similar customers effectively, and thus bring recommendation items closer to target customers' interests.",
