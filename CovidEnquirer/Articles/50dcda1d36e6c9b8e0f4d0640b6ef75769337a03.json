Structures of the N-terminal ligand binding domain of the murine mTIM-1 and mTIM-2 receptors revealed an immunoglobulin (Ig) fold, with four Cys residues bridging a distinctive CC 0 loop to the GFC b-sheet. The structures showed two ligand-recognition modes in the TIM family. The mTIM-1 structure identified a homophilic TIM-TIM adhesion interaction, whereas the mTIM-2 domain formed a dimer that prevented homophilic binding. Biochemical, mutational, and cell adhesion analyses confirmed the divergent ligand-binding modes revealed by the structures. Structural features characteristic of mTIM-1 appear conserved in human TIM-1, which also mediated homophilic interactions. The extracellular mucin domain enhanced binding through the Ig domain, modulating TIM receptor functions. These results explain the divergent immune functions described for the murine receptors and the role of TIM-1 as a cell adhesion receptor in renal regeneration and cancer.",

In contrast, mTIM-2 is an inhibitory molecule of Th2 immune responses Rennert et al., 2006) . mTIM-3 is mainly expressed in Th1 cells and provides a negative costimulatory signal that leads to immune tolerance Sanchez-Fueyo et al., 2003) . Polymorphisms in mTIM-1 and mTIM-3 confer susceptibility to the development of asthma and allergy (McIntire et al., 2001) . Different ligands have been described for the murine members of the TIM family. mTIM-2 binds to Semaphorin 4A and H-ferritin (Kumanogoh et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2005) . mTIM-4 expressed in antigen-presenting cells binds to mTIM-1 and triggers T cell proliferation, preventing development of antigen tolerance (Meyers et al., 2005) . Similar phenotype was observed by crosslinking of mTIM-1 receptor molecules with the 3B3 mAb, which activated T cells and prevented the induction of respiratory tolerance . There is less information about the functions of the human TIM receptors. The HAVCR1 gene that codes for TIM-1 was the first member of the TIM family identified initially in monkeys and subsequently in humans as the hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (HAVCR1) (Kaplan et al., 1996; Feigelstock et al., 1998b) . HAVCR1 is an important asthma determinant gene in humans (McIntire et al., 2003) , and its expression is upregulated in acute kidney diseases and renal carcinoma (Han and Bonventre, 2004; Vila et al., 2004) . The N-terminal Cys-rich domain is critical for binding of the TIM receptors to their ligands (Thompson et al., 1998; Sabatos et al., 2003; Sanchez-Fueyo et al., 2003; Meyers et al., 2005) , and the mucin domain is required for binding of mTIM-1 to mTIM-4 (Meyers et al., 2005) and for the neutralization of HAV particles by TIM-1 (Silberstein et al., 2003) .",

The predicted immunoglobulin fold for the N-terminal Cys-rich domain required further verification because of the unusually high number of conserved Cys residues (six) for a single Ig domain. We pursued structure determination of the Cys-rich region for several receptors and determined the crystal structures of the N-terminal domains of mTIM-1 and mTIM-2. Our work provides a structural view on ligand-binding domains in the TIM gene family. In spite of their high sequence identity (62%), these two receptors displayed striking differences in oligomerization and presentation of ligand-binding epitopes, which explain the reported divergence in ligand recognition. The structures and derived functional data defined two distinct ligand-recognition modes in the receptor family and identified a TIM-TIM intercellular interaction in mice and humans.",

The structures revealed an Ig domain belonging to the V set (IgV), related to the N-terminal domains of the CD4 and CAR (coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor) cellular receptors (highest Z score in DALI search) (Holm and Sander, 1993) . The IgV domains have two antiparallel b sheets with particularly short b strands B, E, and D in one face (BED b sheet) and the A, G, F, C, C 0 , and C 00 b strands in the opposite one (GFC b sheet) ( Figures 1A and 1B) . A Pro residue found prior to the first Cys in all TIM receptor domains was responsible for the short length of the b strand B ( Figure 1D ).

The mTIM-1 BC loop was one residue shorter than the mTIM-2 loop and it did not have a helical conformation.

Almost 50% of the total dimerization surface was buried by the helical BC loop (365 \u00c5 2 ) that sits on the b strand G and approached the CC 0 loop of the neighboring molecule ( Figure 3A ). The His21 side chain on the BC loop stacked over the long Arg36 side chain in the CC 0 loop, and the hydrophobic Leu22 at the tip of the BC loop inserted into a hydrophobic pocket built by Cys35, Tyr39, and Phe98 ( Figure 3A ).

The association of the two IgV domains in the asymmetric unit of the mTIM-1 crystals was remarkably different from mTIM-2. The mTIM-1 domains were related by a rotation angle of about 180 and had their C-terminal ends extending toward opposite directions ( Figure 3B ), which was suggestive of an intermolecular interaction between cell-surface receptors on opposite cell surfaces (Wang et al., 1999) . The domains interact through the upper half of the BED face, including residues following the short b strand B and at the DE loop ( Figures 3B and 3D ). Two Thr17 residues from opposite molecules were hydrogen bonded at the center of the dimer interface. Hydrophobic contacts included Thr13 and Pro15 with the bulky Tyr21 side chain at the BC loop of a neighboring domain. Additional interacting sites between the two mTIM-1 domains engaged several residues at the long DE coil ( Figures 3B and 3D ). Asp69 bound to Ser19 on the BC loop of the opposite domain. Also, His64 and Glu67 were involved in interdomain interactions. Although these two residues at the helical DE loop are not conserved, some charged residues alternate at the aligned positions in the TIM receptors ( Figure 1D ). They could provide certain specificity for binding of TIM receptors in trans.",

The buried surface was also lower than the 600 \u00c5 2 observed in intermolecular interactions between IgV domains of receptors binding through the GFC face (Jones et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1999; Kostrewa et al., 2001) . Occupancy of a cavity between the b strand A, FG, and BC loop of the interacting domains could further stabilize the receptor interaction ( Figure S3 ). In the crystals, the cavity was occupied by the C-terminal end of a symmetry-related domain. In the native mTIM-1 receptor, O-linked glycans from the contiguous mucin domain could penetrate in the interdomain cavity and bridge interacting receptors from opposite cells ( Figure 3B ). Potential glycan-interacting residues such as the basic Lys5 and Arg22, and the conserved Pro92, Trp94, and Asn96 on the FG loop lay on the upper edge of the cavity ( Figure S3 ). Although intercellular binding of mTIM-1 to mTIM-4 has been described in the past (Meyers et al., 2005) , the mTIM-1 structure provided an indication of homophilic binding in the TIM family.",

Soluble mTIM-2 receptors secreted to cell supernatants were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography and chemical crosslinking (Figure 4) . The mTIM-2 molecules eluted with an apparent molecular weight $160 kDa ( Figure 4A ), whereas the size of the reduced protein was $40 kDa ( Figure 4B ). In contrast, the exclusion size of the homologous mTIM-1 receptor molecule was similar to the size of the monomer. Replacement of BC loop residues (HLG, 25% of the buried surface) of mTIM-2 for the aligned residues of mTIM-1 (YR) reduced significantly (about 70%) the amount of mTIM-2 oligomer (Figure 4A) , showing contribution of the BC loop to the mTIM-2 oligomerization revealed by the IgV domain structure. Oligomerization of the mTIM-2 receptors was confirmed by crosslinking experiments, where BS 3 -treated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE ( Figure 4B ). Because the experiment was done under nonsaturating crosslinker concentration, most of the receptor molecules migrated as monomer (40 kDa) in the denaturing gel. Heterogeneity related to O-and N-linked glycosylation could account for the broad bands of the soluble TIM proteins. Crosslinked mTIM-2 receptor oligomers that had molecular weights around 80, 120, and 150 kDa were seen in the BS 3 -treated mTIM-2 supernatants (arrows in Figure 4B ). The intermediate oligomeric forms (80 and 120 kDa) could come from partial crosslinking of the high molecular weight tetrameric mTIM-2 molecule. Because the isolated N-terminal IgV domain of mTIM-2 dimerized in the crystals and in solution, it appears that the formation of the mTIM-2 receptor tetramer required the mucin domain. The absence of mTIM-1 oligomers suggested a divergence in the organization of the cellular receptors on the cell surface.",

(B) Normalized binding of mTIM-1-Fc protein to plastic-coated mTIM-1 IgV in the absence (mTIM-1) or presence of mTIM-1 (T1.4 and T1.10) and mTIM-2 (T2.1) antibodies, or EDTA (10 mM). Binding of a mutant mTIM-1-Fc protein where His64 was replaced by a gluta-mic acid (His64Glu) is also included. Mean + SD of 6 different measurements carried with 20 and 10 mg/ml of Fc protein is shown. (C) 293T cells transfected with the indicated TIM protein tagged with a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) at their C-terminal ends. Fluorescence images of individual (white framed insets) and adhered cells were acquired 2 days after transfection (see Experimental Procedures). DIC image of the cell cluster with three transfected cells (t) and one cell untransfected (ut) or lacking mTIM-1 is shown in the inset. (D) Fluorescence and DIC images of adhered 300.19 preB-cells transfected with CFP-tagged mTIM-1 are on the top. Individual transfected cells untreated or treated with 1 mg/ml of ionomycin for 30 min at 37 C are in the bottom (see also Figure S4 ). protein binding assay, we monitored binding of soluble mTIM-1-Fc fusion proteins with the IgV and mucin domains to plastic-coated mTIM-1 proteins having either the isolated IgV domain used in crystallization ( Figure S4 ) or the complete extracellular region of the receptor ( Figure 5A ). mTIM-2-Fc fusion protein did not bind to either plastic-coated mTIM-1 ( Figure 5A ) or mTIM-2 proteins (not shown). Homophilic mTIM-1 binding was specifically blocked by the T1.10 mAb that recognizes the IgV domain and by the addition of EDTA ( Figure 5B ), which indicated requirement of divalent cations for high-affinity binding and suggested involvement of carbohydrates from the mucin domain. Interestingly, the structure-guided His64Glu mutation in the DE loop of the mTIM-1 IgV domain reduced significantly the homophilic mTIM-1 binding ( Figure 5B) , showing a critical contribution of the DE loop and agreement with the mTIM-1 structure ( Figure 3B ). This mutation decreased moderately (40%) binding of mTIM-1 to mTIM-4 (not shown), suggesting binding through the BED face as well. Determined affinity for the homophilic binding in the BIAcore was about 0.6 mM ( Figure S5 ), about 10 3 times higher than that inferred from sedimentation experiments with the isolated IgV domain. These differences showed requirement of the mucin domain and divalent cations for homophilic mTIM-1 binding, although preliminary observations indicated that the contribution of the mucin domain was more critical for mTIM-1 binding to mTIM-4 than for the homophilic interaction.",

The expected structural similarity between the primate and mouse Nterminal domains allowed us to define a virus-binding surface based on a gene polymorphism in monkey TIM-1 that abolished binding of a protective mAb (190/4) (Figure 7; Feigelstock et al., 1998a) . This antibody blocks HAV receptor binding and protects cells from infection. The antigenic variant Lys to Gln aligns with Glu90 in mTIM-1 (blue in Figure 7) , nearby the CC 0 FG epitope, and located the virus-binding surface on the GFC face of the IgV domain. A Glu residue is also found in human TIM-1, which binds to HAV but is not recognized by the 190/4 antibody. The protruding conformation of the CC 0 FG epitope and its enhanced hydrophobicity in the primate TIM-1 receptors, which have aromatic residues both in the FG and CC 0 loops ( Figure 1D ), could be suited for HAV recognition. Moreover, the conservation of the FG loop in the primate and mouse TIM-1 IgV domains indicated that the enhanced hydrophobicity of the CC 0 loop in TIM-1 could determine its virus-binding specificity ( Figure 1D ). The unique Phe residue in the primate receptors at the Ser37 position of the mTIM-1 CC 0 loop (Figure 7) could in fact be a critical virus-binding residue, as described for a hydrophobic residue at the homologous loop in the CEA coronavirus receptor (Tan et al., 2002) .",

Moreover, the observed trafficking of mTIM-1 to the cell surface upon lymphocyte stimulation revealed a new regulatory mechanism of TIM receptor functions. Engagement of mTIM-1 on the T cell surface by different ligands triggers a cell regulatory signal that has been linked to critical immune reactions (Meyers et al., 2005; Umetsu et al., 2005; Mesri et al., 2006) . The observed clustering of mTIM-1 by homophilic binding at intercellular junctions could facilitate phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic tail, which provides a costimulatory signal for T cell activation (de Souza et al., 2005) .

The conservation of the homophilic mTIM-1 receptor interaction both in mice and humans supports a conserved role in B-T cell crosstalk and its relevance in the immune system. Moreover, murine mTIM-1 and human TIM-1 receptors are overexpressed after ischemic kidney injury (Han and Bonventre, 2004) , and human TIM-1 is overexpressed in renal carcinoma (Vila et al., 2004) . The homophilic interaction described here suggests that TIM-1 could mediate cell adhesion interactions relevant for renal regeneration and tumor development. mTIM-1-related functions must be regulated also by receptor trafficking to the cell surface, which we show here is enhanced by increase of intracellular calcium amounts.

The IgV domains contact through their BED faces, opposite the GFC face commonly used for ligand binding by Ig receptors, which displayed a distinctive CC 0 FG epitope in mTIM-1. Although homophilic binding engaged the N-terminal IgV domain, experiments shown here suggested that carbohydrates from the contiguous mucin domain contribute to the interaction. O-linked glycans from the mucin domain could participate in TIM receptor interactions by occupying cavities generated upon N-terminal domain binding, such as that seen between the interacting mTIM-1 domains. Furthermore, polymorphisms in the mucin domain near the end of the IgV domain (McIntire et al., 2001) might have also some influence on the contribution of the O-linked glycans to the homophilic binding interactions, whereas those close to the membrane could modulate receptor oligomerization on the cell surface as well as intracellular receptor trafficking.",

In contrast to the structural and functional redundancy observed in other receptor families , the structural divergence between the mTIM-1 and mTIM-2 receptors explains the marked differences in their ligand-binding specificities and functions. The lack of a human mTIM-2 ortholog suggests that mTIM-2-related functions in humans must be carried out by a cellular receptor from a related family. In contrast, sequence similarity in the mTIM-1 structural motifs between primate and murine TIM receptors suggests a conserved ligand-binding mode in the family, as well as possible homophilic TIM-TIM interactions with other TIM receptors. Conservation of the homophilic TIM-1 binding in mice and humans suggests a critical implication in the regula-tion of immune responses, although further investigation is now needed to determine the biological significance of this adhesion process. Moreover, structural insights coming from glycosylated TIM receptor are required for understanding the precise role of glycosylation in ligand recognition. Research extending the current knowledge on this relevant receptor family will guide the design of small molecules capable of regulating their functions in the immune system, preventing development of asthma, autoimmune diseases, and hepatitis.",
