            "text": "Aim of the study: Herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and -2) are important pathogens for humans and the discovery of novel anti-HSV drugs with low toxicity deserves great efforts. Rhubarb is one of the oldest and best-known traditional Chinese medicines. We initiated this study to test if emodin is the active ingredients from Rheum tanguticum (R. tanguticum, one of the Chinese Rhubarb) against HSV infection and to investigate its antiviral activity on HSV infection in tissue culture cells and in a mouse model. Materials and methods: Emodin (3-methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) was extracted and purified from R. tanguticum (cultivated at high mountainous area in Qinghai) and the purity was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The antiviral experiments of emodin against HSV infection were performed in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, the HSV-infected mice were orally administered with emodin beginning at 24 h post-HSV exposures with dosages of 3.3 g/kg/day, 6.7 g/kg/day, and 11.3 g/kg/day, respectively, for 7 days. Results: Emodin was found to inhibit the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cell culture at the concentration of 50 g/ml with antiviral index of 2.07 and 3.53, respectively. The emodin treatment increased the survival rate of HSV-infected mice, prolonged survival time and showed higher efficacy of HSV elimination from brain, heart, liver and ganglion, compared to the viral controls. In addition, the antiviral activity of emodin was found to be equivalent to that of acyclovir in vivo. Conclusions: Our results indicate that emodin has the anti-HSV activity in vitro and in vivo and is thus a promising agent in the clinical therapy of HSV infection.",

            "text": "Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are common human pathogens of the family of Herpesviridae, and cause infections worldwide with an estimated 60-95% of human adults infected at least by one of them (Brady and Bernstein, 2004) . Either type can establish lesions at any site of the human body with indistinguishable diseases (Patel et al., 2007) . HSV is transmitted through direct contact of the infected secretions and presents the common biological features of herpesviruses, including latency and reactivation (Chakrabarty et al., 2004; Kleymann, 2005; Greco et al., 2007; Ramachandran and Kinchington, 2007) . Clinical manifestations of HSV infection vary from asymptomatic infection to mucocutaneous lesions, life-threatening encephalitis, and fatal dissemination, depending on the portal of viral entry, host immune competence, and primary or secondary nature of the dis-ease (Leflore et al., 2000; Nadelman and Newcomer, 2000; Brady and Bernstein, 2004) To date, HSV infections are incurable and may persist during lifetime of the host, resulting in a series of psychosocial problems. Significant efforts have been made to develop vaccines and agents against HSV infections. However, no effective vaccine is currently available (Rajcani and Durmanova, 2006; Us, 2006; Ramachandran and Kinchington, 2007) . Acyclovir (ACV) remained the reference treatment for more than thirty years after its discovery (Greco et al., 2007) . Drug-resistant strains emerged due to the extensive clinical use of ACV and its analogues, such as valacyclovir, penciclovir and famciclovir. Although there are some novel treatments available, the uncertainty of their efficacies and the high costs limited their clinical use (Brady and Bernstein, 2004; Chakrabarty et al., 2004; Kleymann, 2005; Greco et al., 2007; Kovalchuk et al., 2007) . Therefore, it remains a continuous need to discover antiviral agents against HSV with lower resistant rate, toxicity and cost.",

            "text": "Rhubarb is a group of plants that belong to the genus Rheum in the family Polygonaceae and is one of the oldest and best-known traditional Chinese medicines. Chinese Rhubarb includes Rheum tanguticum (R. tanguticum), Rheum palmatum, Rheum officinale, etc. The pharmaceutically relevant compounds in rhubarb are sennosides, anthraquinones, stilbenes, glucose gallates, naphthalenes, and catechins (Ye et al., 2007) . Hsiang et al. (2001) observed that the extract of rhubarb prevented the process of HSV attachment and penetration. Wang et al. (2003) reported that the extract of rhubarb showed antiviral activity against HSV that was comparable to acyclovir in vivo. A number of anthraquinones and anthrones isolated from plants and lichens have been shown to exhibit virucidal activity and non-virucidal antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, including HSV (Meruelo et al., 1988; Schinazi et al., 1990; Tang et al., 1990; Andersen et al., 1991; Sydiskis et al., 1991; Barnard et al., 1992; Cohen et al., 1996; Hsiang et al., 2001; Semple et al., 2001) . The anthraquinones in rhubarb are thus potentially the effective component against HSV. The anthraquinone derivatives in rhubarb include physcion, emodin, rhein, aloe-emodin, chrysophanol and their glucosides (Ye et al., 2007) . Among these, emodin is the most abundant one (Huang et al., 2007) . We initiated this study to test if emodin is the active ingredients from R. tanguticum against HSV infection and to investigate its antiviral activity HSV infection in tissue culture cells and in a mouse model.",

The administration of emodin (6.7 g/kg/day and 11.3 g/kg/day groups) significantly reduced the virus titers of mice organ homogenates compared to 0.9% NaCl control group (p < 0.05), and the time needed for virus elimination was dose-dependent. The virus titers in brains, hearts and livers of the emodin groups began to decrease at day 5 after treatment (day 6 after infection). The reduction of virus titers in the ganglion was observed a 2-day delay compared to other organs. The 6.7 g/kg/day and 11.3 g/kg/day emodin group showed faster virus elimination than 3.3 g/kg/day group (p < 0.05). These results suggest that emodin is effective for treatment of HSV infection.",

In vitro, emodin could not prevent HEp-2 cells from HSV infection in the pre-treatment assay, nor could it show virucidal effect against HSV-1 and HSV-2. However, it presented antiviral activities after HSV infection. Our results revealed that the antiviral activity of emodin was more potent against HSV-2 than HSV-1. However, the decrease of CPE and viral titers in culture media was dose-dependent in both HSV types. These were equivalent to the antiviral activities of ACV against both HSV types. Our results imply that emodin may inhibit HSV biological synthesis rather than directly inactivating the viruses or blocking their absorption to the susceptible cells in vitro.",

The emodin-treated mice showed better survival rate, prolonged MTD, decreased viral titers and faster elimination of virus in tissues compared to the virus control group. The most effective dose was 6.7 g/kg/day which was equivalent to ACV at a dose of 0.1 g/kg/day. Mice died in 6.7 g/kg/day emodin groups after 20 days due to the remnant virus existing in the organs (brain and ganglion, other than heart and liver). Hsiang and Ho (2008) found that emodin specifically inhibited HSV-1 UL 12 activity, which is a viral protein involved in viral DNA processing and capsid egression, and then exerted its antiviral activity by accumulating nucleocapsids in the nucleus and reducing the HSV-1 yields. This can explain why emodin decreased HSV replication in our experiment. Several other studies demonstrated that emodin inhibited casein kinase 2 (CK2), which involves in the phosphorylation of many viral proteins that are essential to their life cycle (Yim et al., 1999; Battistutta et al., 2000) . The potent antiviral capacity of emodin could also be based on its ability to disrupt the lipid bilayer, resulting in the effective inactivation of envelope virus (Alves et al., 2004) .",
