According to the report, the two new cases were identifi ed in Borno State, the state at the heart of the Boko Haram insurgency. No doubt, the discoveries are a setback to global polio control eff orts.",

A third case has since been identified and there is fear that more might be discovered. 3 The reduction from half of all 53 cases identified in Nigeria found in Borno and Yobe States in 2013, to only one case in 2014, was suspected to be the outcome of a poor surveillance system. 2 These three cases might be a confirmation of that assertion. Further compounding the problem is that two-thirds of Borno State could not be covered for vaccination in 2015 because of insecurity. 4 With a change in the tactics by the insurgents to attacking soft targets (eg, markets, schools, and camps containing internally displaced people), the challenge to health workers who will play a major part in containing this outbreak in the communities comes to immediate attention. In 2013, nine polio vaccinators on active duty in Kano were gunned down by Boko Haram. 5 This could be another strategy that the insurgents use to attract attention to themselves.",

Most African countries need to fortify their health security because they are affected by both disasters and diseases, which pose a major threat to the infrastrucure. 2 Although Nigeria was successful in its eff ort to control the spread of Ebola virus, the country is still facing numerous public health challenges and needs to strengthen local health security.",

We would like to clarify several of the issues. Dog infections have been addressed programmatically in Chad for the past 4 and a half years. The situation in Chad is diff erent from previous reports of sporadic Guinea worm infections in dogs. What is not made clear by Gal\u00e1n-Puchade is that human Guinea worm has infected dogs occasionally, but when eliminated from the human population, dog infections disappear. 2, 3 By contrast, in Chad, dog infections are probably responsible for the small number of cases in human beings. 4 We expect human infections in Chad to stop once transmission of Guinea worms among dogs is interrupted. Lastly, all evidence suggests transmission is not occurring via common drinking water sources, but via a paratenic aquatic host that people and dogs are eating raw or only partly cooked. 4 Previous laboratory studies have shown that dogs (and cats and monkeys) are good experimental hosts for Dracunculus medinensis. 5,6 Hence, the ease with which this infection was established in dogs is not surprising.",

None of these reliable sources ever encountered a Guinea worm infection in a dog during years of working in endemic areas when hundreds of cases in human beings were being reported. 4 We recently showed that tadpoles were readily infected with D medinensis and harboured larvae that were infectious to ferrets. 7 Tadpoles have been shown to harbour those larvae into the adult frog stage, and that these larvae were infective in mammalian definitive hosts. 8, 9 We recently discovered the occurrence of a D medinensis larva in a wild-caught frog in Chad. 10 In Chad, most water bodies are too large to treat with chemical larvicide, so it is applied to cordoned areas suspected of being contaminated, thus preventing new infections in the following year.",
