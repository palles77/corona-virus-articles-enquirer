Dromedary camels are the principal reservoir for the virus. Infected camels shed the virus in body secretions, particularly nasal discharges. MERS-CoV has the potential to remain active in the environment for some time under optimum conditions of temperature and humidity. This shedding sustains the virus in endemic communities and thus contact with camels is considered a major risk factor for human infection. Reducing virus shedding from camels will have a great positive impact on reducing the human risk of infection. Our main objective is to highlight the potential aspects of reducing virus shedding from camels to the environment, thereby reducing the possibility of human infection. We will focus on the potential roles of camel markets, camel shows, importation, transportation and grazing in the amplification and shedding of the virus, providing some novel concepts for the control approaches for the MERS-CoV.",

Another example of the use of One Health approach to control zoonotic viral diseases was practiced in case of the Hendra virus in Australia. This virus causes serious problems for in close contact with Hendra virus infected or dead horses. The main reservoir of Hendra virus are the flying foxes (fruit bats). Adoption of some One health control strategies helped in the minimizing human exposure of this virus in Australia [8] [9] [10] . These strategies included the culling trials of bats as well as vaccination of horses. All these measures reduced the potential risk of human infection with Hendra virus [9, 11] . Adoption of similar strategy for MERS-CoV in the light of the One Health approach could be a promising control trend.",

On the other hands, a high pedigree male camel may be transferred over a long distance to another in a far distance to inseminate large number of female animals. This procedure usually occur during the ratting season from November to April each year. During the process of mating both male and female animals, come in close contact. Each mating time between the male and female camels is about 20 minutes. It is usually accompanied by gurgling and frothing which may exaggerate virus shedding [12] .

Camel market thus enable amplification and recombination of the MERS-CoV [17] [18] [19] . There are several potential ways to reduce the animal-to-animal transmission in the markets, thus reducing the potential human risk. The animal markets should be relocated to a far distance from major cities and villages. The ideal location of the market should be downstream of the prevailing wind. The market should be re-organized into separate isolated pens per each group of animals. Special consideration should be paid to ensure enough space for each animal and between adjacent animal pens. Overcrowdings of animals may facilitate the virus transmission between animals particular among the active viral shedders. Thus, reducing the number of animals per each pen will minimize the risk of transmission of the virus between animals in the same pen and to neighboring pens. It is recommended to separate the pens of dromedary camels from other species as sheep and goat. Restriction of animal movement between markets should be encouraged. Imported breed of camels should be placed in separate pens apart from the local breeds. One study showed an absence of specific antibodies in sera of some camel herders, veterinarians, and abattoir staff [20] . However, several studies showed the detection of MERS-CoV antibodies in sera of people, camel particular camel workers, veterinarians and abattoir employees [15, 16, [21] [22] [23] [24] . One recent study reported a high prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies among camel workers in Saudi Arabia [25] . Regardless of the discrepancy between the research group and the sensitivity of the techniques to detect the virus-specific antibodies as well as antigen in the at-risk people, special precautions should be taken by these groups of people who get in close contact with dromedary camels.",

There is an active international trade marketing between countries from the Arabian peninsula and countries from north and central Africa particularly Sudan, Somalia, Kenya, Mali, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Morocco, etc. Saudi Arabia is the largest camel importer from these countries especially during the pilgrimage season every year. Dromedary camels from these countries show high MERS-CoV seroprevalence and virus shedding [3, 13, 15, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . A recent study showed the circulating strains of MERS-CoV in Africa are somewhat different in the genomic level from the currently circulating strains in the Arabian Peninsula [32] . The African strains lack the ORF-4 of the MERS-CoV. Thus, this may explain the possibility of recombination and mutations between different strains of MERS-CoV. Special attention should be paid to the importation and movement of dromedary camels between different countries. Imported camels should be sampled and tested for the presence of MERS-CoV antibodies and antigens at the country of origin. They must be quarantined upon arrival, sampled and tested by serology and for the presence of virus in nasal secretions in their nasal secretions. Sero-positive or virus-shedding camels should be quarantined before being allowed into the country. Special attention should be given to camels imported for other purposes such as breeding and shows. These animals will eventually be mixed with local breeds and therefore poses greater risk of MERS-CoV to the local camel breeds. Internal transport of animals should be done in well-equipped vehicles, which should be ventilated and closed. Overcrowding of animals in one vehicle should be prohibited. Shipping act as one of the stress factors posed on the animals and the very close contact between animals favor the transmission not only of MERS-CoV but also other pathogens they may harbor.",

Several herds of animals may get into close proximity and share the same land for grazing at the same time. Some countries have banned grazing in their lands or in certain regions. Camels move across the border of the countries and are mixed with the animals from the neighboring countries. Theoretically, there should be rules governing the grazing and crossing of borders. Animals should be monitored not only for MERS-CoV but also for other pathogens before being allowed contact with other animals. Regular monitoring of animals on the open grazing regions is highly recommended to follow up on the health status Fig. 2 . Proposed model for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus/dromedary camels/ human interaction. The MERS-CoV is transmitted among dromedary camels through the respiratory routes. Strong evidence of the transmission of the virus from dromedary camels to human. Human to human transmission is well documented. Blockage or minimizing the virus shedding from camels will reduce the potential risk of infection with MERS-CoV, pathways marked by the symbol (X). The non-confirmed pathway is marked by a question mark (?). of animals. This will help in the identification of active shedders of the virus, which may contaminate the pasture and act as a source of infection of any subsequent grazing by other herds.",

There is an urgent need for a more systematic and well-designed surveillance system where intensive dromedary camels are raised and exist.

However, there are no established strategies for dealing with active shedder animals as is the in case for other viral pathogens such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Although, some countries have started to develop their own protocols, they are not applicable on a large scale across the world. One major burden is that MERS-CoV does not produce obvious clinical signs in camels despite mild nasal discharge and lacrimation [3, 40] . This makes it very difficult to identify MERS-CoV infected camels or to assess their health conditions based on the clinical signs. The gold standard for the identification of the active infected animal is laboratory testing. WHO established another SOP for laboratory examination, processing and testing of suspected human cases with MERS-CoV [35] . Animal to animal transmission is reported during the course of MERS-CoV infection in a certain animal population V [41] . Animal to animal transmission is reported during the course of MERS-CoV infection in certain animal populations [3, 27, 42] . Ideally, regular monitoring of the dromedary camel population should be scheduled. Special precautions should be adopted for dealing with the positive active shedder animals either within a herd or in camel markets. When positive animals are detected in camel markets, application of quarantine measures should be applied in that market. None of the animals should get in or out of the market during the course of the viral infection. Periodic testing of a statistically significant number of animals from all corners as well as the center of the market should be also conducted. Special precautions should be paid from handlers and camel attendants as well as veterinarians. The workers must wear the appropriate PPE all the time when dealing with animals. Testing and data analysis of animals on a weekly basis should be performed. Thorough cleaning and disinfection of the market should be practiced regularly. The market should not be opened again to the public until all animals are tested free from shedding the virus for at least two consecutive time interval with two weeks apart. A similar approach could be adopted in case of detection of positive MERS-CoV animal in a particular herd. Additionally, the positive camel herd should not be moved during the active course of virus shedding. They should not allowed to graze in an open pasture to avoid spreading of the virus through their secretions.",

            "text": "There is a controversial discussion about the idea of using vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels and humans. Some studies showed a high seroprevalence of MERS-CoV among dromedary camels in Asia and Africa [13, 15, 16, 26, 36, 37, [43] [44] [45] . Other research showed the possibility of reinfection of dromedary camels with MERS-CoV in the presence of neutralizing antibodies in sera of the infected animals [42] . However, several experimental approaches were adopted to prepare and test the efficacy of some vaccine candidates for MERS-CoV in experimental animals, dromedary camels and alpaca [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . A recent study showed that application of an adjuvant-MERS-CoV-S1 vaccine in dromedary camels and alpaca resulted in the production of robust neutralizing antibodies [46] . This study supported the notion that vaccinating young camels under two years will reduce the virus shedding from these na\u00efve animals. Thus, the risk of human infection could be minimized by vaccination.",

People come in close contact with dromedary camels on daily basis such as camel owners, veterinarians; slaughterhouse employees should protect themselves by adopting standard personal hygiene. This include wearing the proper PPE, taking showers after finishing their work, leaving their clothes and gowns in special laundry where they can be thoroughly decontaminated [51] .

Furthermore, there is no effective medication or vaccine to treat or prevent viral infection in both human and animals. The One Health approach has many applications, which can be of great help in the control of the pathogens of animal origin. Adoption of the abovementioned strategies will have a great impact on the reduction of the virus shedding from the dromedary camels to the environment and subsequently to the human.
