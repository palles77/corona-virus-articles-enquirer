Condensation of peracetylated 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-glucopyranose (1) with silylated N 4 -benzoyl cytosine, followed by selective deprotection and isopropylidenation afforded compound 2. Routine deoxygenation at position 2 0 , followed by a deprotection-selective reprotection sequence afforded the partially tritylated dideoxy nucleoside of cytosine 6, which upon oxidation of the free hydroxyl group at the 4 0 -position, furnished the desired tritylated 2,3-dideoxy-3-fluoro ketonucleoside 7a in equilibrium with its hydrated form 7b. Compound 2 was the starting material for the synthesis of the dideoxy fluoro ketopyranonucleoside 13a. Similarly, several subsequent protection and deprotection steps as well as routine deoxygenation at position 4 0 , followed by oxidation of the free hydroxyl group at the 2 0 -position of the partially tritylated dideoxy nucleoside 12, yielded the desired carbonyl compound 13a in equilibrium with its hydrated form 13b. Finally, trityl removal from 7a/b and 13a/b provided the unprotected 2,3-dideoxy-3-fluoro-4-keto and 3,4-dideoxy-3-fluoro-2-ketopyranonucleoside analogues 8a and 14a, in equilibrium with their gem-diol forms 8b and 14b. None of the compounds showed inhibitory activity against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses at subtoxic concentrations, except 7a/b that was highly efficient against rotavirus infection. Nucleoside 7a/b also exhibited cytostatic activity against cells of various cancers. BrdU-cell cycle analysis revealed that the mechanism of cytostatic activity may be related to a delay in G1/S phase and initiation of programmed cell death.",

Pyrimidine nucleosides have attracted increased attention as a result of their important physiological and biogenetic properties. Among them, nucleosides bearing cytosine as a base have been developed as potent antitumor agents, which are effective not only on leukemias and lymphomas, but also on a wide variety of solid tumors in vitro as well as in vivo [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

A series of sixmembered nucleoside analogues, the ketonucleosides, proved to be key intermediates in synthetic and biosynthetic processes and exhibited interesting antitumor and antiviral properties [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . These nucleosides are known to inhibit DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis [28] , to interact with sulfhydryl groups of cellular proteins and enzymes [29] , while they were found to be highly cytotoxic in vitro [24, 30, 31] and to exert powerful inhibitory action against L1210 leukemia in vivo [32, 33] .",

The 1 H NMR spectrum of 7a/b showed a doublet at 6.35 ppm (J 1 0 ,2 0 \u00bc 10.1 Hz) and a doublet of doublet of doublets at 5.22 ppm (J 3 0 ,F \u00bc 47.0 Hz, J 2 0 a,3 0 \u00bc J 2 0 b,3 0 \u00bc 6.9 Hz), which are assigned to H-1 0 and H-3 0 protons, respectively, of keto compound 7a, as well as a doublet at 5.94 ppm (J 1 0 ,2 0 \u00bc 10.6 Hz) and a doublet of doublet of doublets at 4.72 ppm (J 3 0 ,F \u00bc 48.1 Hz, J 2 0 a,3 0 \u00bc 5.0 Hz, J 2 0 b,3 0 \u00bc 5.1 Hz), assigned to H-1 0 and H-3 0 protons, respectively, of gem-diol 7b. Similarly, in the 1 H NMR spectrum of 13a/b, H-1 0 signals of keto 13a and gem-diol form 13b appeared as two sharp singlets at 6.41 and 5.86 ppm, respectively and H-3 0 signals of 13a and 13b appeared as two doublet of doublet of doublets at 5.41 ppm (J 3 0 ,F \u00bc 47.5 Hz, J 3 0 ,4 0 a \u00bc J 3 0 ,4 0 b \u00bc 7.4 Hz) and 4.82 ppm (J 3 0 ,F \u00bc 48.3 Hz, J 3 0 ,4 0 a \u00bc 5.5 Hz, J 3 0 ,4 0 b \u00bc 5.3 Hz), respectively. Thus, in both cases, 1 H NMR spectra confirmed the equilibrium between keto and gemdiol forms. However, 1 H NMR spectra of 8a/b as well as 14a/b in methanol-d 4 (CD 3 OD) solution, showed a doublet at 5.94 ppm (J 1 0 ,2 0 \u00bc 11.0 Hz) assigned to H-1 0 proton for 8b and a sharp singlet at 5.85 ppm, assigned to H-1 0 proton for 14b, while H-3 0 signals appeared as a doublet of doublet of doublets, for both compounds, at 4.72 ppm (J 3 0 ,F \u00bc 48.4 Hz, J 2 0 a,3 0 \u00bc 4.8 Hz, J 2 0 b,3 0 \u00bc 4.9 Hz) and 4.94 ppm (J 3 0 ,F \u00bc 48.5 Hz, J 3 0 ,4 0 a \u00bc 5.5 Hz, J 3 0 ,4 0 b \u00bc 5.6 Hz), respectively, indicating the presence of gem-diol forms exclusively. Finally, the target compounds 7a/b, 8a/b and 13a/b, 14a/b were characterized by the absence of the H-4 0 proton and H-2 0 proton respectively, in their 1 H NMR spectra. The results of the antiviral assays against rotavirus on the newly synthesized dideoxy fluoro-pyranonucleoside analogues 7a/b, 13a/ b and their detritylated analogues 8a/b and 14a/b, respectively, are summarized and compared with AZT in Table 1 .",

Similar results were observed for 7a/b in inhibiting infectivity, following virus attachment (Table 1) ; analogue 7a/b was actually more potent than its congener 8a/b as it produced the same effect at a much lower concentration (0.63 mM) (treatment B). Interestingly, both 7a/b and its detritylated analogue 8a/b, although active in the same antiviral assay, seem to exert their action by a different mechanism. In contrast to compounds 7a/b and 8a/b, analogues 13a/b and 14a/b did not show any antiviral potency. We speculate that the position of the keto group in the ring skeletons of compounds 7a/ b and 8a/b is critical in inhibiting the rotavirus replication in the cell as well as for neutralizing rotavirus before its attachment. According to the antiviral assay used, it can be suggested that the tested compounds 7a/b and 8a/b showed specific activity against rotavirus, and were capable of inhibiting the rotavirus infection in cells at significantly lower concentrations than AZT.",

Because fluoropyrimidine treatment leads to cell cycle arrest [59, 60] , other parameters, such as cell cycle distribution can also be used to predict ketonucleosides sensitivity. In order to find out, whether the mechanism of antitumor activity and/or resistance to dideoxy fluoro ketopyranonucleoside analogues was similar to the mechanism of action of 5FU, the influences on cell cycle distribution and induction of apoptosis were studied by BrdU-cell cycle analysis. Our results clearly showed that in Caco-2 cell line, 5FU equitoxic treatment resulted in an increase of the percentage of cells in G0/G1 and in % decrease of cells in the G2/M phase (Table 3 , compounds 7a/b and 13a/b, Fig. 1 ). However, BrdU analysis showed that a cell cycle delay took place specifically at the G1/S interface as previously reported for 5FU (Table 3 , Fig. 1 ) [59, 60] . Exposure of cancer cells to compounds 7a/b, 13a/b and 5FU led to a % BrdU-positive cells or labeling index (LI) increase. However, LI modifications were only related to the G1/S phase accumulation, and not to a real enhanced S-phase fraction. In fact, BrdU analysis showed that G1 cells, as determined by 7-AAD analysis, were composed of BrdU-positive and BrdU-negative cell subpopulations (Fig. 1) . These subpopulations cannot be distinguished using 7-AAD analysis alone. This is viewed as a consequence of the cell fraction that was able to incorporate BrdU and maintain its G1 DNA content. This fraction was considered to be in phase G1, by 7-AAD analysis, whereas it was included in the labeled subpopulation by BrdU analysis. Thus, cells performing repair synthesis of DNA, with no net DNA increase, would be included in the LI score, but could still have a DNA content that was indistinguishable from G1 cells.",

We speculate that modification in sugar component has a very important role in this case. Furthermore, all newly synthesized compounds showed antitumor activity against tested cell lines, especially gastric cancer derived AGS cells. Compounds 7a/b, 13a/b and 14a/b were even more cytotoxic to all cancer cell lines tested than control compound 5FU. Compounds 7a/b and 13a/ b also showed to be as effective in their antitumor activity and in growth suppression of colon carcinoma cells as previously synthesized corresponding unsaturated fluoro ketopyranonucleoside analogues [40, 41] .",
