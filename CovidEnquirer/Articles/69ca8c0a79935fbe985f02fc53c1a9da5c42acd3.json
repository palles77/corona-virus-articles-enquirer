A recent study has shown that HD patients who are on dialysis treatment while in isolation received suboptimal quality of care and experienced high level of stress. [3] Therefore, strict isolation care during epidemics, including MERS-CoV outbreak, may result in suboptimal dialysis dose and poor clinical outcomes as well as decreased quality of life among HD patients. However, a critical care response manual for epidemics, including MERS-CoV outbreak, in HD units is not available to date.

Although the isolation methods were adopted based on the risk of exposure and available resources, the specific isolation methods (single room isolation vs cohort isolation vs self-imposed quarantine) did not affect the MERS-CoV transmission rate. All techniques were similar in terms of efficacy in preventing secondary transmission of respiratory disease. In addition, no difference was observed in patient survival rate according to the different types of isolation. Patients with end-stage renal disease are at risk of both infectious and non-infectious diseases during disasters. Thus, kidney professionals must be alert in preparing for future disasters. [7] After the catastrophic hurricane that caused mass casualty among chronic renal patients in 2005, the Kidney Community Emergency Response Coalition was established to immediately respond to emergent situations during a disaster. The disaster plan includes recommendations for patients, HD units, and healthcare workers during disasters, education, and emergency planning (alternative HD facilities, diet, transportation, and medication). [7] [8] However, renal disaster includes not only natural disasters, such as earthquakes or hurricane, but also man-made disasters. Recently, infectious disease or the epidemic of infectious origin became another threat to public health and was considered a renal disaster. Renal disaster due to infectious diseases poses a significant risk of spreading infections among exposed patients. Therefore, proper isolation practice among exposed patients in HD units is important in preventing further infection transmission.",

(A) Single-room isolation refers to a method of admitting a patient in a single negative pressure room while providing HD treatment using separate portable reverse osmosis. (B) Cohort isolation is a method of isolating a patient in a single room in an affected hospital while providing HD treatment in an HD room after other healthy HD patients finished their treatment session. (C) Self-imposed quarantine refers to an isolation method for asymptomatic contacts in which a patient stays at home and is transported to the hospital on the day of HD treatment via a designated vehicle provided by the disease prevention authority.
