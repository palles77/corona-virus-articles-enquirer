Twenty-eight weeks after vaccination, the birds were challenged intraocularly with the Arkansas strain of infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) to determine the effects of heterologous virus exposure on egg production, egg quality and serum antibody response of the birds. The challenged hens laid significantly (P<O'OOS) fewer eggs than the unchallenged layers. Eggs laid by the unchallenged groups weighed significantly more (P<O'OOS) than those laid by the challenged groups. Further, the internal quality (Haugh units) and shell quality of eggs laid by the AlBv-challenged hens was significantly (P<O\u00b7 005) inferior to those from the unchallenged hens. In addition, the AlBv-challenged hens laid more soft-shell, misshapen and small eggs than the unchallenged hens. The Arkansas serum haemagglutination inhibition (AIBV-HI) tit res of AIBV challenged birds increased up to four weeks after challenge. The corresponding MIBV haemagglutination-inhibition (MIBV-HI) titres decreased during the same period. The study indicates that killed MIBV vaccine offered no protection to birds exposed to heterologous AIBV.",

            "text": "AVIAN infectious bronchitis (IB) of domestic chickens was first reported from the United States (Schalk and Hawn 1931) , but by the early 1960sIB had been identified allover the world. The IB virus (IBY), a coronavirus, is known to cause pathological changes in the respiratory tract, reproductive tract and kidneys in both laying hen and broiler chicken flocks (Cunningham 1970) . The disease continues to be an economically significant problem despite the widespread use of vaccines (Hofstad 1981 (Koch et aI 1986) , alteration in antigenic characteristics possibly as a result of prolonged exposure to live IBY vaccines (Cook 1983) , lack of availability of a broad spectrum vaccine giving protection against many of the strains of IBY, decline of sufficient immunity to resist reinfection with similar IBY strain (Cunningham 1970) and poor correlation of humoral neutralising antibody titres to protection against reinfection with IBY (Raggi and Lee 1965) . However, Gough and Alexander (1977) reported that the HI tit res of 1:128 did provide resistance to a Massachusetts challenge evaluated by virus recovery from the trachea. The effects of IBY on the reproductive tract of laying chickens are economically significant. The effects observed are in the form of a drop in egg production, laying of eggs of unequal sizes and inferior internal and shell quality (McDougall 1968) .",

The chickens were randomly divided into four groups, each consisting of 25 birds. Each hen in two of the four groups was inoculated subcutaneously with O' 5 ml of a killed, oil emulsion Newcastle disease-infectious bronchitis (Massachusetts type) virus vaccine. The vaccine was manufactured by Intervet America and was stored at 4\u00b0C until used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The hens in the other two groups were not given this killed MIBY vaccine. The birds of one of the killed-vaccine inoculated groups, and one of the unvaccinated groups were challenged with AIBY, while those in other groups served as unchallenged controls. The chickens of all groups were housed four per cage (30 x 45 ern) up to 50 weeks old and were provided identical conditions of light, temperature and ad libitum feed and water. The four groups were housed separately. To determine prevaccination serum antibody tit res against MIBY and AIBY, 10 birds from each of the four groups were randomly bled and their individual serum samples analysed by the haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test using both Massachusetts and Arkansas antigens. The post-inoculation sera from vaccinated and unvaccinated birds were collected at intervals of seven, 14, 22, 52, 172, 194, 201, 208, 215, 222 and 231 days. The group-geometric mean serum antibody HI tit res (GMT) for both MIBY and AIBY were determined.",

The relative SWUSA can be calculated from the surface area by dividing the shell weight by its surface area. The authors' work has demonstrated that the AIBV challenge definitely influences egg surface area (cm-) and SWUSA.

The data obtained through the present work suggest that challenge with AIBV may have the adverse effects indicated above on birds which showed a good antibody production response against a killed Massachusetts type vaccine and had significant levels of antibodies at the time of AlBV exposure. Furthermore titres in response to the Massachusetts vaccine which were lower than reported in this study did confer immunity against a homologous virus challenge (data not presented). There is a need to vaccinate the birds against AIBV to provide protection against this virus. The study also stresses the need for development of a polyvalent IBV vaccine which could confer immunity against multiples of lBV types.",
