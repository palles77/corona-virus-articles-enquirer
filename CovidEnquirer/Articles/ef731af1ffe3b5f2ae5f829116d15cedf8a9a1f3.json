Our objective was to study innate responses induced early following IBV infection in chickens. Initiation of the transcription of selected innate immune genes such as TLR3, TLR7, MyD88, IL-1\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b2, as well as recruitment of macrophages, were evident following an initial down regulation of some of the observed genes (TLR3, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3) in trachea and lung. This initial downregulation followed by the induction of innate immune response to IBV infection appears to be inadequate for the control of IBV genome accumulation and consequent histopathological changes in these tissues. Potential induction of innate immunity before infection occurs may be necessary to reduce the consequences since vaccine induced immunity is slow to develop.",

IBV primarily targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory, urinary and reproductive tracts in the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) (Cavanagh, 2007; Cavanagh et al., 1997; Cook et al., 2012) , results pathogenic processes with mortality rates as high as 30% in chicks less than 4 weeks old and egg production loss in layers. The ability of IBV to infect different organ systems depends on the strain of the virus. For example, infection with the Connecticut (Conn) A5968 strain of IBV is limited to replication in the respiratory tract of chickens (Cavanagh, 2005; Uenaka et al., 1998) and the virus is transmitted between individuals through the shedding of viral particles in the nasal and ocular discharge of infected birds (Cook et al., 2012) .",

These vaccines use IBV strains such as Massachusetts, Connecticut and Arkansas and combinations thereof providing protection against almost all field strains of IBV. However, emergence of new variant more heterogeneous IBV strains (Cavanagh, 2003) , leads to infectious bronchitis outbreaks in vaccinated flocks leading to significant production losses (Shimazaki et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2007) . Therefore a novel approach that could be used as an alternative or additional to the existing means of control is urgently needed. One such approach may be the use of innate immune mediators to empower the innate immune system.",

            "text": "The innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection in chickens are interconnected, with the innate or non-specific response being the more rapid of the two. Immune cells and cells on the mucosal surface are involved in innate immune responses and recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs are generally conserved between the different types of pathogens, but are not expressed by the host cells, and can be recognized by the host cell through membrane associated and intra-cellular toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Akira, 2001) . Among TLRs, TLR3 and TLR7 are well known for recognition of RNA virus encoded PAMPs (Akira, 2001) . In chickens, TLR3 and TLR7 are orthhologous to their mammalian counterparts (Kannaki et al., 2010) . TLR3 recognizes and binds to the double-stranded (ds)RNA intermediates produced during viral replication (Alexopoulou et al., 2001; Higgs et al., 2006; Iqbal et al., 2005) Stimulation of TLR3 leads to activation of TIR-domain-containing adapterinducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF) adaptor protein-mediated pathway, whereas TLR7 responds to single-stranded (ss)RNA produced during intracellular viral replication, activating the myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) mediated-pathway (Akira, 2001; Watters et al., 2007) . The end products of both TLR3 and TLR7 signaling pathways are the production of anti-viral type I interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and -\u03b2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively (Guillot et al., 2005) . Interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 plays an important role in chemotaxis, stimulating the cellular response and recruiting cells, such as macrophages, to the site of infection (Babcock et al., 2008) . Macrophages are important cells of the innate immune response; their functional roles include phagocytosis of foreign material, cytokine and chemokine secretion, and the presentation of antigens to help facilitate the development of antigen-specific adaptive immune responses (Mast et al., 1998; Qureshi et al., 2000; Tate et al., 2010) . Macrophages are also source of nitric oxide (NO) production, which is the product of the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in defence against microbial infections (Ariaans et al., 2008; Ficken et al., 1987; Naqi et al., 2001; Read, 1999) .",

Therefore, the objective of our investigation was to characterize the host innate response in terms of the expression of TLRs, type I and II IFNs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, as well as any changes in macrophage numbers within the lungs and trachea early during infection with IBV. In this study, we saw an up-regulation of TLR3 and TLR7 mRNA and increased macrophage numbers in the trachea and lung, as well as an up-regulation of IFN\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression in trachea that indicated the initiation of innate host responses. Conversely, we also observed an initial down regulation of mRNA expression of genes, namely TLR3, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3.

However, a significant increase in relative IFN-\u03b2 gene expression was observed in trachea at 24 hpi, supporting the previous claims that the activation of the TLR3 pathway works towards an upregulation of IFN-\u03b2 production in chickens after 12 hpi (Karpala et al., 2008; Otsuki et al., 1979; Parvizi et al., 2012) .",

Although we did not investigate the viral proteins involved and the mechanism of down-regulation of host innate immune molecules in our study, various types of coronaviruses have been known to encode proteins that disrupt the downstream signaling cascades used during the innate immune response to infections (Zhong et al., 2012) . The nucelocapsid (N) protein has been shown to interfere with the 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase/ RNaseL (2 0 -5 0 OAS) activation, which is responsible for Type I IFN induction and can also inhibit the production of various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines via global translational shutdown (Ye et al., 2007; Zhong et al., 2012) . The non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) expressed by IBV has also been implicated in deubiquitinating activity, which prevents nuclear translocation and/ or production of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and sequential synthesis of Type I IFNs (Clementz et al., 2010) . In vitro experiments involving the infection of cell cultures with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and IBV indicate that the interaction of the spike protein found in both coronaviruses and host eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is responsible for the modulation of host immune gene expression (Xiao et al., 2008) . However, our study indicated that this initial down-regulation of innate immune genes is associated with the increase in IBV replication and the virus induced histological changes in trachea and lung. Neither Guo et al. nor Wang et al. observed a down-regulation in expression of the these genes (Guo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2006) , which could be due to the use of the less virulent vaccine strains in their studies.",

IL-1\u03b2 mRNA also showed a similar down-regulation when compared to uninfected controls in trachea, but conversely also shows a sharp increase in mRNA expression as the IBV infection progresses. This is further substantiated by the observations of Wang et al. and Guo et al., where both studies found a similar increase in IL-1\u03b2 expression levels around 72 hpi with Mass IBV immunization (Guo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2006) . In contrast, mammalian studies of IL-1\u03b2 response to viral infections have been found to be more rapid than in chickens, with up-regulated gene expression observed as early as 6 hpi (Lawrence et al., 2013; Poeck et al., 2010) .",

The expression of mRNA of TLR3, TLR7, MyD88, TRIF, iNOS, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03b3 were calculated using REST 384 \u00a9 (Relative Expression Software Tool) (Pfaffl, 2001; Pfaffl et al., 2009; Pfaffl et al., 2002; Pfaffl et al., 2004; Vandesompele et al., 2009) . The calculation uses the geometrical mean of Efficiency(Eff.)(control) Crossing point (Cp) for all control genes (\u03b2-actin and ubiquitin). FlowJo version 7.6.4 (Ashland, OR, USA) was used to complete the flow cytometry data visualization and analysis. Except for the REST 384 \u00a9 results, all data was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's test to identify differences between observations and groups using the statistical package, MINITAB s release 15 (Minitab Inc. State College, Pennsylvania, USA). Comparisons were considered significant at Pr0.05.",
