Methods: A total of 749 suspected MERS-CoV patients presenting at Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare, Saudi Arabia, each submitted a clinical sample for influenza A reflex testing using the on-site Cepheid\u00ae Xpert Flu assay and at the Ministry of Health laboratory by the Roche PCR assay. Results: There was 92.12% overall agreement between the two methods. Specificity of the Cepheid\u00ae Xpert Flu was 95.8% for H1N1 and 94.4% for total influenza A. Cepheid\u00ae Xpert Flu sensitivity for influenza A was 100% for younger patients (0-19-year age group) but significantly lower both for older patients (68.2% for 60-79year and 50% for \u226580-year age groups) and overall for males compared to females (72.6% and 94.0%, respectively). Conclusions: Specificity of the Cepheid\u00ae Xpert Flu test was high; however, sensitivity for total influenza A was lower particularly in males and older patients.",

True positives were defined as samples scored positive by the MOH method and also identified as positive by the Cepheid\u00ae Xpert Flu Assay for total FluA \u00b1 H1N1 pdm09 as appropriate. Sensitivity (true-positive rate) was calculated as the percentage of infections positively identified by both methods compared to the gold standard method only.

A larger number of samples would be helpful in establishing if there was any significant trend in reduced sensitivity of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 detection for males or for older patients. Reduced sensitivity of total FluA detection in older patients could be related to decreased viral shedding in older adults or to delayed presentation, which has been shown to influence sensitivity of other types of H1N1 diagnostic tests such as rapid antigen testing (Flamaing et al., 2003; Talbot et al., 2010) . In our study, there was a higher-than-predicted proportion of older males compared to females aged \u226580 years, which could be relevant to the significantly reduced sensitivity of detection of FluA in samples from males versus females. Sensitivity of detection of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 was also lower in males; while this was not statistically significant, the difference was approaching significance, and a larger sample number may allow a determination of whether this represents a real reduction in sensitivity.",

Subsequently, it spread worldwide by person-to-person contact, including to the KSA (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2011; Balkhy et al., 2010; Uthman et al., 2014) . In June 2009, WHO declared that influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 had reached pandemic level phase 6. In order to prevent and control influenza outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics and initiate appropriate and timely antiviral treatment, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are essential. Clinical presentations of different seasonal flu strains, including influenza A (H1N1) , 2009) . Diagnostic methods of choice are therefore currently based on molecular techniques, in particular, the real-time PCR as in the kits used in this study, which have the advantages of being rapid and sensitive (Choi et al., 2010; Lam et al., 2010) . The RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) incorporates a generic influenza virus A PCR targeting the matrix protein-2 \"M2 gene\" (M2 PCR) and a specific PCR targeting the variable part of hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 (H1 PCR) (Barb\u00e1s et al., 2012; Choi et al., 2010; thi Tham et al., 2012; Wenzel et al., 2010) . This kit has been shown to have specificity of 97%-100% in detection of both influenza A and of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 in comparison to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/WHO real-time PCR protocol (Choi et al., 2010; thi Tham et al., 2012) . Sensitivity results have been more variable. In one study of 1341 nasopharyngeal (NP) samples collected in Argentina in 2009, sensitivity for seasonal influenza A detection in the presence or absence of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 was 75.4%, sensitivity for influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 detection was 76.4%, and sensitivity for detection of influenza A only was 53.3% (Barb\u00e1s et al., 2012) . However, other studies suggested that sensitivity of newer generations of the kit was moderate to good, between 85.8% and 88% for influenza A (M2 PCR) and approximately 88.2% for influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 (H1 PCR), and was comparable to other molecular tests (Choi et al., 2010; thi Tham et al., 2012; Wenzel et al., 2010) .",

It allows differential, qualitative detection of viral RNA from influenza A, influenza B, and influenza A (H1N1) pdm09. In this study, we nominated the MOH-approved RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set as the gold standard. However, there is some evidence to suggest that the Cepheid\u00ae Xpert Flu Assay may be more sensitive than the RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set in comparison to other molecular tests or to culture detection (Barb\u00e1s et al., 2012; Choi et al., 2010; Novak-Weekley et al., 2012; Popowitch et al., 2011; Salez et al., 2012; Sohn et al., 2013; thi Tham et al., 2012; Wenzel et al., 2010) . The Xpert assay has been previously shown to be 100% specific for detection of seasonal influenza A and influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 in NP samples compared both to other molecular tests and to culture testing (Novak-Weekley et al., 2012; Popowitch et al., 2011; Salez et al., 2012) . Furthermore, its sensitivity in comparison to other molecular tests was 100% for seasonal influenza A and between 90% and 98.4% for influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, 90%-100% for seasonal influenza A in comparison to culture detection, and 100% for influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 in comparison to culture detection (Novak-Weekley et al., 2012; Popowitch et al., 2011; Salez et al., 2012) . In a small comparison study of 102 clinical samples in Korea, overall, 99% agreement was observed between the Cepheid\u00ae Xpert Flu Assay multiplex real-time PCR kit and the RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set (Sohn et al., 2013) . In our larger study, we observed 92.1% agreement. The Xpert kit requires less time for test performance, including less hands-on time (Sohn et al., 2013) . Another important advantage is that the Xpert kit can also detect influenza B. While influenza B infections cause epidemics more rarely than the A strains, they nevertheless do cause human illness and are incorporated in the seasonal influenza vaccines (WHO, 2016) .",

            "text": "Limitations of our study included the relatively small number of samples from sites other than Dhahran City and of sample types other than NP swabs. Also, available clinical information was limited to age, sex, areas, and sample types. We had no information concerning underlying or subsequent conditions of the patients. Another limitation was that duplicate samples were taken from patients and the two assays were not performed on the same sample; thus, there is the possibility that there may be differences in sample quality which could contribute to discordance between assays. The fact that C t values did not differ for either assay between discordant and concordant samples suggests that this is unlikely, but it remains a possible limitation.",

            "text": "Over 200,000 respiratory deaths are estimated to have occurred globally during the 2009/2010 influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 pandemic, with 80% of deaths in people younger than 65 years (Dawood et al., 2012) . In the Eastern Province of KSA, 587 cases were detected from samples sent to the MOH by the Saudi Aramco Medical Services Organization (SAMSO) between June and October 2009, an incidence of 3.5 per 1000 (Herzallah et al., 2011) . Infection was particularly common among younger people. It is therefore vital to be vigilant in monitoring potential outbreaks of this disease in the KSA. Testing samples both on site in the Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare Centre using the Cepheid\u00ae Xpert Flu Assay and in the MOH laboratory using the RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set may help expedite detection of cases and improve reliability of detection in the Eastern Province. This should help with prevention and control of outbreaks, and with initiation of appropriate and timely antiviral treatment. However, the lower agreement between the tests in terms of positive results should be borne in mind, in particular for males and for older patients.",
