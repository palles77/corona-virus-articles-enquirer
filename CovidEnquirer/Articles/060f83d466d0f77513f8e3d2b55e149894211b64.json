Since studies applying molecular diagnostic assays usually report reductions in the number of undiagnosed cases of infectious disease compared to traditional techniques, we applied PCR assays to investigate the role of two recently described viruses, namely human coronavirus (HCoV) HKU1 and human bocavirus (HBoV), in a hospital-based paediatric population. Both viruses were found among Australia children with upper or lower respiratory tract disease during the autumn and winter of 2004, contributing to 21.1% of all microbial diagnoses, with individual incidences of 3.1% (HCoV-HKU1) and 5.6% (HBoV) among 324 specimens. HBoV was found to coincide with another virus in more than half of all instances and displayed a single genetic lineage, whilst HCoV-HKU1 was more likely to occur in the absence of another microbe and strains could be divided into two genetic lineages which we propose be termed HCoV-HKU1 type A and type B. Children under the age of 2 years were most at risk of infection by these viruses which contribute significantly to the microbial burden among patients with respiratory tract disease during the colder months.",

Nucleotide sequencing of coronavirus-positive specimens determined two instances of HCoV-HKU1. Using HCoV-HKU1-specific primers provided by Dr. Patrick Woo, Hong Kong University (personal communication) we re-screened the population and detected an additional eight instances of HCoV-HKU1 infection from NPAs of children less than 4 years of age and one 40 year old adult, resulting in a prevalence of 7.5% of whom 66.7% were female. One co-detection, representing 11.1% of HCoV-HKU1 positive specimens, was detected in which HMPV and HCoV-OC43 were also present in the same 13-month-old male presenting with bronchiolitis. We next designed a new pair of PCR primers for HBoV diagnosis in order to avoid the non-specific amplification we noted when screening using a previously described assay (data not shown; (Allander et al., 2005) ). When investigating the same specimen population we detected 18 instances of HBoV from the NPAs of children less than 3 years of age (59.3% male) indicating a prevalence of 5.6% comprising 13.5% of all microbial detections.",

These values are significantly greater than those reported in the original publications describing HCoV-HKU1 in Hong Kong and HBoV in Sweden. Our detections of these two viruses provided a putative aetiologic cause for ARTI in 16 previously undiagnosed subjects. Based on these data we recommend the inclusion of HCoV-HKU1 and HBoV testing in routine laboratory screening of children and adults with suspected ARTI during the colder months. Co-detections were not common with HCoV-HKU1 infection and our data strongly suggests that apparent respiratory disease may often be the result of infection by this coronavirus. By comparison, 55.6% of all HBoV-infected patients were also infected with another virus, most frequently HRSV, which is a well-characterised cause of mild to severe ARTI. In the original description of HBoV, Allander et al. (2005) reported that 17.6% of positives were co-detected with another virus namely one incidence of HAdV and two of HRSV. However, it was unclear what other microbial targets had been screened for in that population; therefore, it is to be hoped that future studies can contribute to this issue (Allander et al., 2005) . Currently neither HCoV-HKU1 nor HBoV can be associated with ARTI until more detailed, carefully controlled community and hospital-based studies are performed to elucidate the full spectrum of disease resulting from infection.",

Such conclusions will be reached more rapidly if comprehensive studies can define the annual incidence of these viruses and the prevalence of infection within the broader community. Additionally, targeted studies are needed to investigate the role of these putative pathogens among the elderly and the immunocompromised. Nonetheless, we have shown that HCoV-HKU1 and HBoV both occur in children with suspected acute respiratory tract disease and that the two viruses contribute significantly to the total microbial burden at our hospital during winter. We recommend that HCoV-HKU1 be considered in the laboratory diagnosis of ARTI during autumn and winter and that further studies are needed to define the role of HBoV in ARTI.",
