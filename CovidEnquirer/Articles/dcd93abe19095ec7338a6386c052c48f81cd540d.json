            "text": "Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) is a parvovirus that causes enteritis and panleukopenia in domestic and wild cat species worldwide. 2 It has also been associated with disease in raccoons, mink, foxes, and a monkey, and can replicate in ferrets without causing disease. Feline panleukopenia is sometimes confusingly referred to as \"cat plague\" and \"feline distemper.\" FPV is a small, single-stranded non-enveloped DNA virus that is closely related to CPV-2, but in contrast to CPV-2, which emerged in the late 1970s, the existence of FPV has been known since the 1920s. 1 FPV has the same ability as CPV-2 to survive long periods in the environment and resist disinfection, and has the same preference for replication in rapidly dividing cells (see Chapter 14) .",

            "text": "Feline panleukopenia is most likely to occur in cats younger than 1 year of age, but it can occur in unvaccinated or improperly vaccinated cats of all ages. The median age of affected cats in one study was 4 months, and when disease occurred in vaccinated cats, it occurred only in cats that had not received a booster vaccine after 12 weeks of age. 3 However, kitten deaths have been reported in households of fully vaccinated kittens, possibly because of exposure to large amounts of virus in the environment. 4 Outbreaks of panleukopenia in cats correlate seasonally with increases in susceptible newborn kitten numbers. Panleukopenia occurs most commonly in multicat households, and especially in enclosed, shelter environments. It can also occur in cats with outdoor exposure, such as barn, feral, and stray cats. In one study, the prevalence of protective antibody titers to FPV in feral cats in Florida was only 33%, which suggested a low rate of exposure to the virus. 5 In some North American shelters, devastating outbreaks of panleukopenia have led to euthanasia of large numbers of cats. Contact with other cats may not be present in the history, because fomite transmission is so effective. 3 FPV replicates to a limited extent in dogs, without disease or virus shedding. Some feline panleukopenia results from infection of cats by the related mink enteritis virus, CPV-2a, CPV-2b, or CPV-2c. [6] [7] [8] Mixed infections with FPV and CPV-2 variants have been detected in cats, and there is evidence for recombination between FPV and CPV-2 variants. 7, 9 Infection of cats with CPV-2 variants is uncommon in Europe but predominated among cats with panleukopenia in Asia. 10 Other viral pathogens that have been associated with gastroenteritis in cats include feline enteric coronavirus (see Chapter 20) , FeLV, rotaviruses, caliciviruses, reoviruses, and astroviruses. A torovirus-like agent has been associated with a syndrome of diarrhea and protrusion of the nictating membranes in cats. 11 Togavirus-like and picornavirus-like particles have been identified in the feces of Australian cats, but their significance is uncertain. 12",

Transmission is by the fecal-oral route, and indirect transmission through contaminated fomites represents the most important means of infection. Like CPV, FPV enters cells using transferrin receptors 13 and replicates in cells that are in the S-phase of the mitotic cycle. Initially, the virus replicates in oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue, after which it disseminates in blood to all tissues. Infection of lymphoid tissues leads to lymphoid tissue necrosis. Infection of the marrow is associated with leukopenia, which is compounded by neutrophil sequestration in damaged gastrointestinal tissue. The virus replicates in the intestinal crypt epithelial cells, with shortening of villi, increased intestinal permeability, and malabsorption.",

Co-infections can occur with feline enteric coronavirus, Clostridium piliforme, Salmonella spp., FeLV, or astroviruses. [14] [15] [16] [17] Disease generally occurs after an incubation period of 2 to 10 days. The peracute form of disease involves death without apparent premonitory signs. Infection of kittens or adult cats results in clinical signs of fever, lethargy, vocalization, weakness, and inappetence, which may progress to profound dehydration, vomiting, sometimes watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea, and rapid loss of weight. Some cats develop only anorexia and lethargy, in the absence of vomiting, diarrhea, or leukopenia. 3 Secondary bacterial infections appear to be essential for signs of disease to occur. Death usually results from complications relating to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, hypoglycemia, hemorrhage, or bacteremia and endotoxemia. In the developing fetus or neonate, FPV replicates in a variety of tissues. Abortion, congenital abnormalities, or infertility can result from infection early in pregnancy, although the queen is generally otherwise unaffected. Later in pregnancy or in neonates up to approximately 1 week of age, viral destruction of Purkinje cells and granule precursor cells located in the cerebellar external granular layer leads to cerebellar hypoplasia ( Figure 19 -1). The severity of infection can vary between kittens in a litter. Sometimes a portion of the litter fails to survive and the remainder develop neurologic signs. 18 Signs of cerebellar ataxia are nonprogressive and are most apparent when kittens begin to walk at about 2 to 3 weeks of age, although mentation and appetite are otherwise normal, and these kittens can sometimes make acceptable pets. Other developmental central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities have been reported less commonly, and include hydrocephalus, porencephaly (cystic lesions within the cerebral hemispheres), or hydranencephaly (complete replacement of the cerebral hemispheres with cystic lesions). These abnormalities may be accompanied by signs of forebrain damage, such as seizures and behavioral changes. Unlike canine parvoviruses, FPV appears to be able to infect neurons other than the cerebellar Purkinje cells, which are terminally differentiated cells. 19 Ocular lesions can also develop and include retinal folding, dysplasia and degeneration, and optic nerve hypoplasia.",

            "text": "Use of serology for diagnosis of feline panleukopenia is complicated by widespread exposure or immunization, so serologic assays that detect antibody against FPV are generally used to assess the need for vaccination rather than for diagnosis. They can also be used in outbreak situations in order to determine which cats are at risk for development of disease and virus shedding, and which cats are protected and therefore at low risk. The gold standard method for FPV serology is hemagglutination inhibition, which measures the ability of serum to prevent agglutination of erythrocytes by the virus (see Chapter 2) . Serum neutralization assays may also be used. Point-of-care assays designed to detect antibody titers to CPV have a low sensitivity (28%) for detection of antibodies to FPV in cats. 21 A point-of-care assay designed to detect feline antibodies (ImmunoComb Feline VacciCheck Test Kit, Biogal, Galed Labs, Israel) also had a low sensitivity (49%), although specificity was high. 21 The use of this test for risk analysis in shelter situations may lead to inappropriate removal or isolation of cats with false-negative results for protective antibody titers, which might waste time, space, and financial resources. 21 However, positive results should reliably indicate protection. The test can be performed quickly (30 minutes) and requires as little as 5 \u00b5L of serum or plasma, so provided it is understood that a negative result means either a protected or susceptible status, and a positive result equates to protection, the test still has the potential to provide useful information.",

In general, false-negative results are common with these assays, but false positives are uncommon, so a positive test result in a cat with consistent clinical signs suggests a diagnosis of feline panleukopenia. The specificity of one point-ofcare device (SNAP Parvo, IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME) was high; 54 of 55 positive assay results were confirmed with a PCR assay. Another study of 52 cats with diarrhea and 148 healthy cats showed variability in the sensitivity and specificity of five different test kits when compared with fecal electron microscopy. 23 Sensitivity ranged from 50% to 80%, and specificity ranged from 94% to 100%. This study included only 10 cats with FPV as determined with electron microscopy. Additional studies are warranted that evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these assays in larger numbers of cats with FPV infection when both real-time PCR and electron microscopy are used as the gold standard. False-positive fecal antigen assay results after vaccination with attenuated live viral vaccines appear to be uncommon, but again vary with the test used. 24 Of the SNAP Parvo (IDEXX Laboratories), AGEN CPV (AGEN Biomedical Ltd., Brisbane, Australia), and the Witness CPV (Synbiotics Corp, San Diego, CA), the SNAP Parvo was least likely to yield positive results after vaccination.",

Effective vaccines are widely available, and include both parenteral inactivated and attenuated live viral vaccines. An intranasal FPV, FHV-1 and feline calicivirus vaccine is available; its use has been controversial, because panleukopenia is a systemic disease. An outbreak of salmonellosis and panleukopenia occurred in one cattery that used an intranasal FPV vaccine. 4 No difference was noted in seroconversion rates between five cats vaccinated with the intranasal vaccine and five cats vaccinated with a parenteral attenuated live vaccine, but the number of cats in this study was small, and a larger number of cats that were vaccinated with the parenteral vaccine had protective antibody titers on day 7. 30 Both inactivated and attenuated live vaccine types induce protective antibody titers after vaccination in a high proportion of cats, 5 although the attenuated live vaccine may be more likely to induce protective titers than the inactivated vaccine. 24 Provided maternally-derived antibody (MDA) is absent, immunity occurs within 1 week after a single vaccination with an attenuated live viral vaccine 31 and lasts for at least 3 years, and possibly for life. 32 Nevertheless, two doses, 3 to 4 weeks apart, have been recommended for initial vaccination with attenuated live vaccines in the absence of MDA. Two injections are always required for inactivated vaccines, and maximal immunity does not occur until 1 week after the second dose. However, even with an inactivated vaccine, challenge 7.5 years after vaccination was associated with protection. 33 The use of inactivated vaccines should be reserved for immunosuppressed cats or colostrum-deprived neonates that are less than 4 weeks of age, or when there is a need to vaccinate pregnant cats. In shelter situations, the use of attenuated live vaccines is always recommended because of the slow onset of immunity with inactivated vaccines. 34 FPV vaccines protect cats against challenge with CPV-2b strains. 35, 36 However, cross-reactivity of antibodies induced by FPV vaccination to CPV-2 strains was lower than that to FPV as determined using hemagglutination inhibition. 37 The extent to which FPV vaccines protect against infection with other CPV-2 variants requires further investigation. 38 The most common reason for vaccine failure is interference by MDA. Maternal antibody persists until at least 12 weeks, and possibly longer in some cats. Virus neutralization titers above 1:10 are likely to interfere with vaccination, and kittens with titers below 1:40 are generally considered to be susceptible to infection by FPV. Kittens should be vaccinated every 3 to 4 weeks from 6 to 8 weeks of age, and it is recommended A C B that the last vaccine in the kitten series be given no earlier than 14 to 16 weeks of age. When there is a history of an outbreak situation, the final booster could be given no earlier than 18 to 20 weeks of age. 39 In all situations, a booster should be administered at 1 year, and every 3 years thereafter.",

In the face of an outbreak, exposed and susceptible kittens may be effectively protected for 2 to 4 weeks through subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration of 2 mL of type-matched serum from cats with a high antibody titer. 39, 40 However, this is only effective when administered before the onset of clinical signs, and it can interfere with subsequent vaccination. For these kittens, it has been recommended that vaccination be withheld for 3 weeks after the serum has been administered. 39 Passive immunization may be useful when cats are introduced into a shelter situation where a known problem exists. Repeated treatment with serum should be avoided because hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Prevention of feline panleukopenia should also include proper disinfection with disinfectants that are effective against parvoviruses, such as bleach, accelerated hydrogen peroxide, or potassium peroxymonosulfate (see Chapter 11) and, in shelter situations, isolation or removal of cats that develop gastrointestinal illness, and separate housing for healthy kittens.",

The current owner had fostered the cat for 1 week after she was found as a stray. The cat had been nursing a litter of kittens. The kittens were 4 weeks old, being weaned and apparently healthy. Since being fostered, the cat had exhibited a progressive decrease in appetite and thirst, and her feces had become soft and pasty. The night before she was brought to the emergency clinic, she had been bathed, and afterwards she vomited bile-stained fluid twice and was placed on a heating pad. The following morning she was found laterally recumbent and minimally responsive. Kruse Gross Necropsy Findings: Ten mL of semiopaque red fluid was present in the peritoneal cavity. Streaks of hemorrhage were noted throughout the skeletal muscle. Between the pylorus and the ileocecocolic junction, the serosa of the small intestinal tract was dark red to purple to black (see Figure 19 -2). The entire small and large intestinal tract was dilated and flaccid. The small intestinal mucosa was dark red to purple and contained a small amount of dark red mucoid material. The mesenteric lymph nodes were prominent, and their cut surface was discolored red to dark pink. The liver was pale yellow and extended beyond the costal arches. Numerous petechial hemorrhages were present on the serosal surface of the urinary bladder.",

Necrosis extended into the crypts, and there was some evidence of a regenerative response that included enterocyte hypertrophy, karyomegaly, and rare mitotic figures. Mixed bacteria, which included small gram-negative rods and large numbers of gram-positive cocci, lined and effaced the denuded villi. There was diffuse lymphoid depletion in lymph nodes, as well as the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the cecum and colon. Marked depletion of erythroid and myeloid precursors was present in the bone marrow. There were multifocal areas of hemorrhage in the skeletal and cardiac muscle, intestinal tract, and lungs, as well as fibrin thrombi in the lungs. FPV antigen was identified in intestinal epithelial cells using immunohistochemistry. Culture of the jejunum for Salmonella spp. was negative.",

Secondary bacterial sepsis was suspected. Additional co-infections with other viruses, such as feline coronavirus, or enteropathogenic bacteria could not be ruled out.

ABCD guidelines on prevention and management. J Feline Med Surg. 2009;11:538-546. and Outcome: Callie was treated with active warming, and a central venous access line was placed. Intravenous crystalloids (four warmed 60-mL boluses of lactated Ringer's solution [LRS], each given over 20 minutes) were administered, after which an venous acid-base panel showed a pH of 7.267 (7.31-7.46), bicarbonate of 17.5 mmol/L (14-22 mmol/L), base excess of \u22128.1 mmol/L (\u22124 to +2 mmol/L), pCO 2 of 39.7 mm Hg (25-37 mmHg), lactate of 4.5 mEq/L (<2 mEq/L), glucose of 52 mg/dL, potassium of 3.1 mEq/L, sodium of 141 mEq/L, and ionized calcium of 1.17 (1.1-1.4 mmol/L). A dextrose bolus and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (22 mg/kg, q6h, IV) were administered. The cat repeatedly vomited blood-tinged fluid, and so treatment with metoclopramide (0.02 mg/kg/hr) and famotidine (0.5 mg/kg IV q12h) was initiated. Aggressive crystalloid fluid therapy was continued (LRS supplemented with 30 mEq/L KCl and 2.5% dextrose), and treatment with hetastarch was also initiated. Systolic blood pressure (Doppler) was 60 to 90 mm Hg, heart rate increased to 170 beats/min, and rectal temperature increased to 100\u00b0F. When the CBC results were available, the cat was placed in the isolation ward. Pasty diarrhea that contained sloughed mucosa occurred every 1 to 2 hours, which transitioned to liquid red feces over 24 hours. A CBC again showed absolute neutropenia and 15,000 platelets/\u00b5L. After another 24 hours, the cat's condition deteriorated despite aggressive treatment and monitoring. Partial parenteral nutrition was initiated. That evening, pyrexia developed (104.6\u00b0F) as well as tachypnea and increased respiratory effort. The owner elected euthanasia. The cat regurgitated approximately 200 mL of dark brown fluid at the time of euthanasia.",
