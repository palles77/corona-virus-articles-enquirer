            "text": "Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) belong to a family of modified nucleotide analogues, in which the sugar moiety has been replaced by a functionalized acyclic chain linking the nucleobase at one end and the phosphonic acid group at the other. Therefore, ANPs are metabolically stable due to the presence of a phosphonate linkage (P-C) instead of a phosphoester (P-O), making these compounds resistant towards phosphatases. Furthermore, they do not require the first intracellular phosphorylation step which is often considered as a limiting-step and essential for the antiviral effect. Indeed, ANPs share their mechanism of action with other nucleoside analogues. Briefly, after two subsequent phosphorylation steps the ANP is converted to its corresponding triphosphate derivative, which can then interfere with nucleic acid biosynthesis as a DNA chain terminator. 5 Amongst the antiviral agents that exhibited a broad spectrum of activity and bear a phosphonate group, adenine containing ANPs are well represented (Fig. 1) . Prodrugs of Adefovir (PMEA, 1) and Tenofovir (PMPA, 2) have been approved for the treatment of hepatitis B and HIV infections, 6 respectively. Herein, we aimed to obtain novel ANPs structurally related to Adefovir (PMEA) which contained a carbinol moiety that replaced the oxygen atom of the phosphonomethoxyethyl chain (Fig. 1) . The CH(OH) functionality is not an isostere for the C-O-C linkage, however, the resulting b-hydroxyphosphonate derivative may present some structural features (distance between the nucleobase and the phosphonate moiety, flexibility and so on) and the presence of the hydroxyl group may allow the formation of supplementary hydrogen bonds.",

Initially the reaction was conducted in the presence of various bases such as K 2 CO 3 , 12 Cs 2 CO 3 , or catalytic Na in methanol. 13 Finally, diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) was selected as a suitable base, allowing the exclusive formation of the N-9 alkylated product in good yield (77%). It is noteworthy that this step could be easily scaled up to a 25 g batch. After removal of the solvent, the addition of ethyl acetate to the crude afforded pure 5 as a precipitate without further purification. The exclusive formation of the N-9 alkylated product was confirmed by NMR and UV absorption studies. 14 The exocyclic amino group of 5 was next protected with a monomethoxytrityl (MMTr) group to give 6 in 88% yield (Scheme 2). The MMTr moiety was chosen as the nucleobase protecting group to enhance the solubility of intermediate 6 in the less polar solvents used in the next step of the synthesis (such as THF). Compound 6 was treated with an excess of the lithium salt of dimethylmethylphosphonate at \u00c078\u00b0C in THF and afforded the desired key intermediate b-ketophosphonate 4 in 55% yield.

The origin of the chemical shift difference is attributed to the shielding cone of the phenyl ring from (S)-MPA; the signals of the substituents under the shielding cone are moved upfield. 16 When the phenyl group is eclipsed with the adenine-CH 2 -CH 2 moiety in the less polar diastereomer (Fig. 2) , the two methylene groups are shielded and should appear upfield compared to the more polar one. Indeed, we observed that the Ad-CH 2 -CH 2 signal resonates at 2.16 ppm in the less polar diastereomer whereas it resonates at 2.28 ppm in the more polar one (Dd 0.12 ppm). Similarly the Ad-CH 2 -CH 2 resonates at 3.59 ppm in the less polar diastereomer, whereas it resonates at 4.04 ppm in the more polar one (Dd 0.45 ppm). On the other hand, when the phenyl group is eclipsed with the (CH 3 O) 2 P and the CH 2 P(O) groups, as in the more polar diastereomer, both the methyl and methylene protons are shielded and should appear upfield with respect to the less polar one. Indeed, the two methyl protons of the (CH 3 O) 2 P group resonate at 3.51 and 3.49 ppm in the more polar diastereomer (Fig. 2) , whereas in the less polar one, they resonate at 3.61 and 3.57 ppm (Dd 0.1 and Dd 0.08 ppm, respectively). Similarly, the protons of the CH 2 P(O) group resonate at 1.87 and 1.99 ppm in the more polar diastereomer whereas in less polar one, they appeared at 2.02 and 2.1 ppm (Dd 0.15 and Dd 0.11 ppm, respectively).

This difference can be attributed to the p-stacking effect between the phenyl ring and the nucleobase. This observation was supported by molecular modelling studies and suggested that the H-8 proton was in close proximity to the phenyl ring. The 2D NMR-NOESY spectra were also obtained and a selected portion is shown in Figure 3 . In the case of the less polar diastereomer (R,S)-8, we clearly observed cross peaks between the H-8 proton of the nucleobase and the aromatic protons of MPA with both the adenine-CH 2 -CH 2 moiety and the (CH 3 O) 2 P groups (Fig. 3B ). In comparison with an identical part of the 2D NOESY spectrum of the more polar diastereomer, due to the overlapping of the signals of interest, less relevant cross peaks were observed (Fig. 3A) . Consequently, the 1 H-, 13 C-and 31 P-NMR spectra of both isolated diastereoisomers strongly suggested that the absolute configuration of the less polar compound is (R,S)-8 while the more polar compound is (S,S)-9.",

Molecular modelling was achieved using the Biopolymer module implemented in the Insight II suite program (Accelrys). Atomic charges and potentials were assigned using the Gasteiger-Marsili empirical atomic partial charges 17, 18 and Charmm22 force field, 19 respectively. Then, four planar angles were selected corresponding to the bonds of the methoxy and carbonyl groups of MPA and the proton at the b-position to the phosphorus atom of each diastereomer, and a systemic conformational search using the AMMP (Another Molecular Mechanics Program) program 20 and Charmm22 as Force field was carried out on the diastereomeric pair. Molecular modelling studies supported the NMR chemical shift analysis of each diastereomer due to the geometry predicted by Mosher's approximation 21 in which the methoxy and carbonyl groups of MPA and the proton at the b-position to the phosphorus atom are in almost the same plane for both diastereomers (Fig. 4) .",

The newly obtained derivatives were assayed in various cell lines (including HEL, CRFK, Vero, MDCK and HeLa cells) for antiviral activity against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses [varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1, KOS and TK -KOS), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus and vesicular stomatitis viruses, feline herpes and corona viruses, parainfluenza-3, reovirus-1, Sindbis, Coxsackie B4 and Punta Toro virus, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and influenza B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus]. However, none of them revealed a significant effect up to 100 lM. Cytotoxicity was evaluated on HEL, Vero, HeLa and MDCK cell cultures and the studied compounds were found to be non-toxic (up to 100 lM). Further studies are currently underway to tentatively explain the lack of biological activity.",
