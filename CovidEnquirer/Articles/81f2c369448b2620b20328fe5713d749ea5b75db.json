Despite the established usefulness of discourse organizational cues for lecture comprehension and note-taking, very little is known about the marking of relevance in this genre. The current overview of lexicogrammatical relevance markers combines a qualitative and quantitative investigation of 160 lectures from the British Academic Spoken English (BASE) corpus. These markers could mostly be classified according to their main element into adjective, noun, verb and adverb patterns. Verb patterns were the most common, followed by noun patterns. The verb pattern V clause (e.g., remember slavery had already been legally abolished) and the noun pattern MN v-link (e.g., the point is) are the predominant types of relevance markers. The discrepancy between the prevalent markers and what may be thought of as prototypical or included in EAP textbooks as relevance markers also demonstrates the need for corpus linguistic research. Implications for EAP course design, teaching English for lecturing purposes, and educational research are discussed.",

These international lecturers, teaching assistants and students may benefit from English courses tailored to meet their particular communicative needs in lectures. This corpus-based study adds to our knowledge of lecture discourse by reporting on ways in which important points are highlighted. In this way, we aim to inform the design of such courses by providing an overview of authentic relevance markers that can be used to help students identify important points and that may assist lecturers or teaching assistants in marking these effectively.",

            "text": "Since the knowledge gained from lectures forms a critical part of assessment and thus academic success, it is important to ensure they are sufficiently understood to allow adequate note-taking, assimilation and recall. An essential aspect of successful lecture comprehension and delivery is the ability to distinguish between important and less important information (Flowerdew, 1994; Kiewra, 2002; Lynch, 1994; Mulligan & Kirkpatrick, 2000; Tyler, 1992 ). Yet, both native and non-native speakers are reported to have significant difficulties in discerning the main lecture points. In fact, some note-taking studies have found that native speakers generally only record up to 40% of the main points (see Titsworth & Kiewra, 2004 for an overview). Non-native speakers' comprehension and note-taking can additionally be compromised by inadequate understanding of English, by the lecturer's speech rate (Nesi, 2001) and pronunciation (Williams, 1992) , and by differences in discourse expectations, background knowledge and educational culture (Duszak, 1997; Flowerdew & Miller, 1996; Nesi, 2001) .",

This combined function is central to our definition of relevance markers. On the one hand, we have focused on the evaluation of 'discourse entities' (Thetela, 1997 , cited in Hunston (2000 182)), i.e. evaluation on the 'interactive plane' of discourse (Sinclair, 2004) . Thus an important point is considered an instance of discourse evaluation, while an important philosopher is disregarded because important here evaluates a 'world entit[y]' (Thetela, 1997 , cited in Hunston (2000 ) and so exemplifies evaluation on the 'autonomous plane' of discourse (Sinclair, 2004) . In other words, we are interested in instances of evaluation where the lecturer acts as 'text constructor' rather than 'informer' (Hunston, 2000, p. 183 ). On the other hand, discourse organizational cues without evaluation of importance (e.g., the next point is) were also not taken into account.",

Admittedly, however, much lecture discourse is a representation of other people's discourse and the exclusion here pertains only to instances which are attributed. Fourth, it was impossible to exclude reliably the highlighting of information presented visually (e.g., in slides and handouts, on the board). The inclusion of instances of such 'metasemiotic' evaluation (Baldry & Thibault, 2006, p. 99 ) is moreover important in creating a representative picture of relevance marking in this genre, as visuals are an integral part of lecture delivery. Using a definition of relevance markers refined by the above considerations, a close reading by the first author of the other 36 lectures in the subcorpus yielded further lexemes which could mark relevance. These were then retrieved from all 160 lectures using the concordancing tool Sketch Engine. In this, as in all other searches, co-text beyond the concordance was examined as necessary to determine whether a lexeme functioned as (part of) a relevance marker. Ungrammatical and disfluent instances were retained if analysable. Further candidates for relevance marking in the immediate co-text and in a frequency list of words with P50 occurrences in the BASE lectures were also searched. Additionally, a few relevance adjectives were adopted from Swales and Burke (2003) and Crawford Camiciottoli (2004) and the adjective-and noun-based lexicogrammatical patterns of relevance markers listed in Crawford Camiciottoli (2007, p. 98) were searched empty (i.e., without specifying particular adjectives or nouns) using corpus query language to identify further lexis. Finally, we searched words which were derived from or synonymous with lexemes found through the above procedures (cf. Giannoni, 2010) . This multipronged approach yielded adjectives, metalinguistic nouns, verbs and adverbs which could function as or in relevance markers and which generally appeared in recurring lexicogrammatical patterns (see Section 4). Interestingly, most lexemes were retrieved manually from the subcorpus and all approaches were complementary. For instance, the word frequency list yielded adverbs which were not found in the subcorpus but did not contain the multi-word items discovered when examining the subcorpus (e.g., bear in mind, bottom line). To further temper some of the subjectivity that is inevitable in analysing evaluation, a sample of 120 instances of these patterns was independently rated for their status as relevance markers by the second author. After discussion, full agreement was reached on their in-or exclusion as relevance markers.",

The rare cases of adjectival premodification (e.g., absolutely, very) are mainly restricted to this adjective. The predominant pattern it v-link ADJ clause represents cases of extraposition. Surprisingly, in Crawford Camiciottoli's study (2004, 2007) of relevance markers in 12 Business Studies lectures and 10 multi-disciplinary lectures from MICASE 4 this pattern is infrequent. Instead, the most frequent pattern there is deic v-link ADJ, which in BASE was far less common as a relevance marker than extraposition. It is, however, difficult to draw conclusions from a comparison with Crawford Camiciottoli's study as her corpus is much smaller and more homogeneous in disciplinary terms and as the information on search methods and inclusion criteria provided does not allow us to establish methodological causes that may account for different findings.",

While EAP courses aimed at improving students' lecture comprehension and note-taking are already fairly common, EAP courses for lecturers seem at present rather rare. However, continuing internationalization combined with a growing recognition of the need to support lecturers in using English for the specific purpose of lecturing will likely lead to an increase in such courses.

However, this study shows there is a wide range of relevance markers, the most frequent of which (MN-link, V clause) may not be those that intuitively come to mind. It would thus be useful to help students recognize a variety of authentic relevance markers. In doing so, we may want to pay special attention to popular but multifunctional devices such as MN-link and V clause.

Second, to keep the study manageable we have focused on metadiscursive and metasemiotic relevance marking although the evaluation of entities outside the discourse (e.g., an important philosopher) possibly also focuses attention on the lecturer's talk about such entities. Third, information on points lecturers intended to highlight or listeners perceived as important would be illuminating but could not be obtained. This seems an inevitable limitation of using large, ready-made corpora. For smallscale studies, this could partly be resolved by getting other students to read or watch the lecture to identify highlighted points or by analysing which points occur in the conclusions.",
