This decrease occurred throughout the country, even in areas with no reported cases of Ebola virus disease. The decrease occurred despite health facilities generally remaining open, likely because of fi nancial incentives put in place by the National Ebola Coordination to encourage health-care workers to remain at health facilities. Although community members were not interviewed during this survey, data from interviews of the health-care workers and community health workers support the hypothesis that the decline in attendance is likely indicative of the population's fear of accessing the formal health sector. The decline in the number of patients receiving antimalarial drugs is only partly explained by reduced attendance at health facilities, pointing to subtle changes in health-care seeking and delivery that diff er signifi cantly between Ebola-aff ected and Ebola-unaff ected areas. Since the start of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, patients have been less likely to seek care at health facilities or report fever. The interpretation of testing and treatment rates at health facilities is not straightforward because the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic coincided with a scaleup of rapid diagnostic test, artemisinin-based combination therapy, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine training and distribution to health facilities, confounding the eff ect of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic on testing and treatment. However, even with the scale-up of the availability of rapid diagnostic tests, rates of testing did not increase in Ebola-aff ected prefectures. Contrary to expectation, the rate of presumptive treatment of fever cases with antimalarial drugs in health facilities and by community health workers decreased or did not change since the start of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic.",

Several key alternative explanations for the reduction can be excluded. Climatic changes are unlikely to have caused the decline, since 2014 was an average year for rainfall in Guinea (appendix). Although there were universal campaigns for coverage of bednet distribution throughout Guinea in late 2013, and early 2014, the timing does not correspond to the decline in malaria cases seeking care at health facilities, and this alternative explanation does not account for why the decline in malaria cases would be larger in Ebola-aff ected areas.

            "text": "Taken together, the decline in attendance at health facilities and in the numbers of patients treated with antimalarial drugs at health facilities and the suspension of community health workers' activities represent a major challenge for malaria care delivery in Guinea. Before the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, the formal public sector was the most common source of care for febrile illness in children (57%), with the most common alternatives being traditional healers (13%) and private pharmacies (8%). 8 The two major avenues for delivering life-saving medicine to patients with malaria-public health facilities and community health workers-have been substantially compromised by the Ebola-virusdisease epidemic. Eff orts to reinforce malaria care delivery in Guinea should be focused on reconnecting health-care workers and health facilities with the communities they serve and whose trust they need to regain. Similarly, community health workers who are currently inactive or have left their unpaid malaria case management duties to be paid Ebola-virus-disease contact tracers should be incentivised and provided the means to continue safely delivering malaria care in the community even as they continue their Ebola-virusdiseases-related activities. These interventions cannot wait until the last case of Ebola virus disease. Already, a substantial number of malaria cases have gone untreated or inappropriately treated. Although subject to much uncertainty, according to the estimations from expert opinion surveys the risk of an untreated and uncomplicated malaria case progressing to severe malaria ranges from 3% to 30% (depending on age and malaria endemicity) and then dying from severe malaria ranges from 45% to 73%. 13 Assuming the estimated 74 000 malaria cases not receiving malaria care at health facilities due to the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic (likely to be an underestimate because of the incompleteness of the weekly surveillance system) received no care or inappropriate care outside the formal health sector, excess malaria deaths are likely to greatly exceed the number of deaths from Ebola virus disease, consistent with fi ndings from recent mathematical models. 14 Moreover, untreated malaria cases are likely to have contributed to an excess number of febrile episodes in the community and a greater number of suspected cases of Ebola virus disease requiring triage and isolation at over-burdened transit centres and Ebola treatment centres where uninfected people might have been exposed to Ebola virus disease. Malaria control eff orts and malaria care delivery must be sustained and even heightened during an Ebola-virus-disease epidemic. ",
