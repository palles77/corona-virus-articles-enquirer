For some individuals the exact values are available while for others the corresponding intervals of censorship are observed. We mention two situations where middle censoring occurs. (i) In a follow-up study, if the childhood learning center where the observations are being taken, is closed for a period, due to an external emergency such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). (ii) In a clinical trial, where the clinic where the observations are being taken, is closed for a period, due to an external emergency such as the outbreak of war or a strike. For situations (i) and (ii) where during a fixed time interval (this fixed interval is indeed, a random interval (denoted by (U,V)) relative to individual's lifetime) the observation was not possible. If some children (or patients) develop a skill (or disease) of interest during this time, we are not able to observe the exact age T of these children (or patients) at the time of skill (or disease) development, rather only the information that the event of interest occurred during a certain time interval (U,V). At first glance, middle censoring, where a random middle part is missing, appears as complementary to the idea of double censoring in which the middle part is what is actually observed. However, a careful reflection and analysis shows them to be quite different ideas; see Jammalamadaka and Mangalam (2003) for details.",

This equation was first introduced and referred to as self-consistency equation by Efron (1967) . A solutionF S of (1.2) is called a self-consistent estimator (SCE) of F 0 . In different types of censoring, the relationship between nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) and SCE has been studied by various authors. In the case of right censoring the product-limit estimator (Kaplan and Meier, 1958) is the NPMLE, and Efron (1967) showed that it is also self-consistent. In the double-censoring case, Mykland and Ren (1996) provided a necessary and sufficient condition for an SCE to be an NPMLE. In the middle censored cases the self-consistent estimator (SCE) (see Jammalamadaka and Mangalam, 2003 )F S satisfies the following equation:",

Furthermore, they showed that the NPMLE will have all its mass on the uncensored observations except when it so happens that a censored interval contains no uncensored observation. The consistency of the SCEF S was established by Jammalamadaka and Mangalam (2003) for the special case when either U i or V i is degenerate.

They established the asymptotic properties ofF 0 S and provided an upper bound of the difference between F 0 and F 0 0 . Mangalam et al.

Furthermore, if we start with an initial estimator which puts weight 1/J on q j = p j for uncensored observations and on (q j +p j )/2 for censored observations, we can obtain an NPMLE by using Eq.

A data set is called a MIC data when it consists of both exact observations and case 2 interval censoring data (i.e. L i o R i ). Mixed IC data arises in clinical follow-up studies where a tumor maker (e.g., Ca 125 in ovarian cancer) is available, a patient whose marker value is consistently on the high (or low) end of normal range in repeated testing is usually under close surveillance for possible relapse. If such a patient should relapse, then the time to clinical relapse can often be accurately determined. However, if a patient is not under close surveillance, and would seek assistance only after some tangible symptoms have appeared, then time to relapse would be subject to case 2 interval censoring. For MIC data, several models have been proposed, and the asymptotic properties of the NPMLE have been investigated under the assumption that either the censoring variables take on finite many values (see Huang, 1999; Yu et al., 1998 Yu et al., , 2000 , or the censoring and survival distributions are strictly increasing and continuous and they have ''positive separation'' (see Huang, 1999, Assumption (A3) ). For MIC data, define (Y i ,Z i ) as a pair of extended random censoring times (1 allowed) with P\u00f0Y i o Z i \u00de \u00bc 1, and T i is independent of (Y i ,Z i ). Yu et al.
