            "text": "Peritonitis is defined as inflammation of the peritoneal cavity and may be classified according to the underlying cause (primary or secondary), extent (localized or generalized), or the presence of infectious agents (septic or nonseptic). Primary peritonitis refers to a spontaneous inflammatory condition in the absence of underlying intraabdominal pathology or known history of penetrating peritoneal injury. Secondary peritonitis occurs more commonly in the dog and cat and is the consequence of a preexisting aseptic or septic pathologic intraabdominal condition. Because of the multitude of conditions that may lead to peritonitis the types of clinical signs and their severity vary. Hematogenous dissemination of infectious agents has been postulated as the mechanism of development of primary peritonitis and likely is facilitated by impaired host immune defenses. The most common form of primary peritonitis is the effusive form of feline infectious peritonitis, caused by feline coronavirus, which should be included on any differential diagnosis list for cats with peritoneal effusion. Other infectious agents reported to cause primary peritonitis in dogs and cats include Salmonella typhimurium, Chlamydia psittaci, Clostridium limosum, Mesocestoides spp., Bacteroides spp., Actinomyces spp., Blastomyces spp., and Candida spp. Given the common occurrence of isolated Bacteroides and Fusobacterium spp. from cats with primary septic peritonitis, these bacteria may be translocating from the oral cavity through either unrecognized direct penetration (bites) or a hematogenous route. 1 Inflammation of the abdominal cavity in the absence of infectious pathogens (aseptic peritonitis) most commonly occurs in response to exposure of the peritoneum to sterile fluids (i.e., gastric, biliary, or urine), pancreatic enzymes, or foreign material. Aseptic bile and urine cause minimal peritoneal inflammation, whereas gastric fluid and pancreatic enzyme leakage lead to a more intense peritoneal reaction. Microscopic and macroscopic foreign material, including surgical glove powder, surgical materials (suture, cotton swabs, surgical sponges), hair, and impaled objects (sticks, plant material, metal) may elicit a granulomatous response. To minimize iatrogenic causes of aseptic peritonitis, surgeons should rinse surgical gloves preoperatively with sterile saline or use powder-free gloves, perform a surgical sponge count before opening and closing a celiotomy, and use surgical sponges with radiopaque markers.",

            "text": "More commonly, secondary peritonitis is identified as a septic process, most commonly secondary to contamination from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Leakage of GI contents may occur through stomach and intestinal walls that have been compromised by ulceration, foreign body obstruction, neoplasia, trauma, ischemic damage, or dehiscence of a previous surgical incision. Spontaneous gastroduodenal perforation may be associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug administration but also may be seen with corticosteroid administration, neoplastic and nonneoplastic GI infiltrative disease, gastrinoma, and hepatic disease. 2, 3 Neoplasia was found to be the underlying pathology in 25% of cats with septic peritonitis secondary to GI leakage in one study, with adenocarcinoma and lymphosarcoma the most common types. 4 Septic peritonitis secondary to surgical site dehiscence occurs in 6% to 16% of postoperative patients requiring intestinal enterotomy or resection and anastomosis. 5-8 GI linear foreign bodies in dogs have been reported as the inciting cause of peritonitis in 41% of cases, higher than that previously reported for cats. 9 One canine study found that two or more of the following conditions increased the risk for leakage after intestinal anastomosis: preoperative peritonitis, intestinal foreign body, and a serum albumin concentration of 2.5 g/dl or less. 8 In addition, a recent study suggests that intraoperative hypotension is also a risk factor for the development of septic peritonitis after gastrointestinal surgery. 5 Interestingly, this retrospective of 225 surgeries found the presence of a foreign body to be a protective factor. Other causes of septic peritonitis can be found in Box 122-1.",

Animals recovering without incident from GI surgery also may have a transient inflammatory leukogram; however, the overall peripheral white blood cell counts typically fall within normal limits. 11 An increasingly left-shifted neutrophilia (or neutropenia) paired with clinical signs of peritonitis may raise the clinician's index of suspicion for postoperative intestinal dehiscence (which typically occurs 3 to 5 days after surgery).",

Hyperkalemia (and azotemia) may indicate uroperitoneum, particularly if trauma or urinary tract dysfunction has been noted historically. Hypoproteinemia may be a result of the loss of protein within the peritoneal cavity. Patients with a concurrent septic process may be hypoglycemic. Hepatic enzymes, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen may be elevated, indicating primary dysfunction of these organs or perhaps reflecting a state of decreased perfusion or dehydration. The serum of patients with bile peritonitis is often icteric if the total bilirubin is elevated. Recently, the prevalence of ionized hypocalcemia in cats and dogs with septic peritonitis has been recognized and a failure to normalize calcium levels during hospitalization associated with negative prognosis. 12, 13 Plain radiographs may reveal a focal or generalized loss of detail that also is known as the ground glass appearance. A pneumoperitoneum (Figure 122-1) suggests perforation of a hollow viscous organ, penetrating trauma (including recent abdominal surgery) or, less commonly, the presence of gas-producing anaerobic bacteria. Intestinal tract obstruction or bowel plication should be ruled out. Prostatomegaly in male dogs and evidence of uterine distention in female dogs should be noted. Thoracic radiographs should be performed to rule out concurrent illness (infectious, neoplastic, or traumatic). The presence of bicavitary effusion increased the mortality rate of patients 3.3-fold compared with that of patients with peritoneal effusions alone. 14 Ultrasonography may be useful for defining the underlying cause of peritonitis, in addition to its use in localizing and aiding retrieval of peritoneal effusion. In the case of a confirmed uroabdomen, preoperative contrast radiography (excretory urography or cystourethrography) is recommended to localize the site of urine leakage and aid in surgical planning.

These patients may arrive in progressive states of hypovolemic and cardiovascular shock, with either injected or pale mucous membranes, prolonged capillary refill time, tachycardia with weak pulses, and with either hyperthermia or hypothermia reflecting poor peripheral perfusion. A significant number of cats (16%) with septic peritonitis exhibited bradycardia (see Chapters 6 and 91). 4 In fact, the combination of bradycardia and hypothermia in cats with primary septic peritonitis has been established as a negative prognostic indicator. 1 Animals with uroperitoneum may continue to urinate with concurrent leakage into the peritoneal cavity.",

Studies in which patients have benefited from advances in critical care management cite overall The use of vacuum-assisted peritoneal drainage (VAPD) recently has been described as a means to provide continued postoperative abdominal drainage (see Chapter 139). Although the caudal one third to two thirds of the abdominal incision is closed primarily, the remainder of the incision is reapposed loosely (as described earlier in the chapter) and subatmospheric pressure applied to the cranial portion of the incision. This approach has been used successfully in human patients and its success demonstrated by significant reductions in open abdominal drainage duration times, number of dressing changes, re-exploration rate, and successful abdominal closure rates. 23, 24 Superiority of this approach has yet to be established in small animal surgical patients. Survival rates for canine and feline septic peritonitis patients treated with VAPD has been reported as 37.5% (3/8) 25 and 50% (3/6), 26 which is similar to that seen with other abdominal drainage techniques. However, at this time, insufficient case numbers have been examined to draw conclusions as to whether the success of VAPD seen in human patients can be achieved in veterinary medicine. Dressings are available commercially that provide a barrier between the abdominal wall and viscera to protect the abdominal organs.",

Typically, one drain placed between the liver and diaphragm is sufficient for small dogs and cats, whereas two drains are more appropriate for larger dogs (the fenestrated portion of second drain is placed in the caudal abdomen along the ventral body wall). The drain tubes exit the body wall through a paramedian stab incision and are sutured to the abdominal skin with a pursestring and Chinese finger-trap sutures (Figure 122-4) . After routine closure of the abdomen, the suction reservoir bulb is attached to the tubing with vacuum (negative pressure) applied. A protective abdominal bandage is placed with sterile contact material around the tube-skin interface and is changed daily to allow assessment of this site. Fluid collected within the bulbs is emptied using aseptic technique, and the volume is recorded every 4 to 6 hours, or more frequently if needed. Drains are removed by applying gentle traction when the volume of fluid production has decreased significantly and cytologic analysis suggests resolution of the peritonitis (i.e., decreasing cell numbers and nondegenerative neutrophils, absence of bacteria).
