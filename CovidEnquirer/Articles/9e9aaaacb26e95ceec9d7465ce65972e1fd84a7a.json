This phenomenon is especially obvious on a windless sunny day. The near wall thermal plume can drive gaseous pollutants released from lower floors to upper floors. Combined with the effect of ambient approaching wind, the transmission routes will be very complicated. The paper aims to investigate the airflow patterns and pollutant transmission within a building under the effects of wind and thermal forces. A hypothetical twenty-storey slab-shape high-rise building in Shanghai with single-sided natural ventilation is set as the research object in the present study. The intensity of solar radiation on a typical day during transition season is theoretically analysed. The temperature difference between the heated building envelope and the ambient air is calculated by a simplified heat balance model. Finally, the tracer gas method is employed in the numerical simulation to analyse the influence of the wind and wall thermal plume flow on the inter-flat pollutant transmission characteristics. The results show that, the temperature difference between sunward and shady side wall is about 10 K at noon on the designate day. When the source is set as a point with steady intensity and the buoyancy is stronger than or approximately equivalent to the wind, the reentry ratio of the flat immediately above the source can be around 25%.",

Understanding how contaminants continue to pose a significant threat to human health is highly emphasized. The airflow can carry hazardous air pollutants moving within a room or between rooms even buildings to influence the residents' health [1] . Such long-distance routes of transmission are called airborne transmission, which is reported to be one of the major respiratory syndrome transmission routes by numerous engineering and epidemiological studies [2] [3] [4] [5] . A lot of researches involving airflow patterns and aerosol-transmitted scenarios in multiscale area have been done by onsite full-scale measurements, reduced-scale wind/water tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques [6] [7] [8] [9] . For urban scale, the airflow is complicated because of the interaction with the inhomogeneous underlying surfaces [8] . For street scale or building arrays, the microclimate in the street canyon or a neighborhood area will influence the natural ventilation process of buildings. The pollutants from vicinity, like traffic exhaust, dust and atmospheric aerosols, can easily penetrate into the indoor environment [9] [10] [11] . For indoor circumstance, studies about the travel of airborne infectious pathogens in hospitals, schools, offices, homes, aircraft cabins and other indoor environment have been performed to illustrate the pollutant behavior and help to guide the air distribution design [10] [11] [12] [13] . Li et al. [14] reviewed over 40 multidisciplinary studies and demonstrated the evidence of interconnection between building ventilation and the transmission of airborne infections.",

The airborne fine droplets can be carried upwards by buoyancy-forced air convection flow [15] . Thus, the upward contaminant flow can take the potential health issues to the neighbor upstairs. This inter-flat infection path is firstly identified and explored after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes (SARS) clusters occurred in several high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong, where the most affected occupants dwelled along the same vertical blocks on different storeys [16] [17] [18] . Li et al. implemented a study for the largest SARS outbreak in Ward 8A at Prince of Wales Hospital [17] and in Block E of Amoy Garden [18] . They also verified the probability to reduce airborne infection by optimizing the ventilation performance in the hospital wards [19] . Pressure control methods have been considered as an effective technology to control the transmission of infectious virus in hospital environment [20] . Nevertheless, such strategies are not feasible for those residential buildings without centralized ventilation systems. Therefore, the process of pollutant interflat transmission in residential buildings is generally elaborated in the light of the mechanisms of natural ventilation. As to the contaminants in residential buildings, the proliferation and accumulation of harmful components or odors such as second hand tobacco smoke and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may also cause a health concern. Several studies revealed that the passive tracer gas method can be used for reflecting the movement and distribution of gaseous pollutants or fine particles [21, 22] .",

            "text": "Based on the above facts and work, Niu et al. [23] first proposed a possible airborne re-entry behavior of inter-flat cross-contamination driven by indoor/outdoor temperature difference under the condition of single-sided natural ventilation through open windows. Previous onsite tracer gas tests and numerical simulations on buoyancy-forced inter-flat dispersion well explained and quantified the vertically upward transport of gaseous pollutants [24, 25] . Subsequently, a series of wind tunnel tests [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] and numerical calculations [31] [32] [33] were carefully carried out to explore the inter-flat transmission dominated by wind force. Mao et al. [34] reviewed the mechanisms and evaluation indexes for the airborne transmission and dispersion between flats by single-sided natural ventilation in high-rise residential buildings. In general, it has been revealed from the previous studies that in the single-sided ventilation mode, the airflow exchange and migration of contaminants within the building are normally driven by wind effect, buoyancy effect, or combined wind and buoyancy effect. The synoptic wind speed and direction have an essential impact on the strength of wind effect [35, 36] . For the buoyancy effect, one inducement is the difference between indoor and outdoor temperature, the other one can be the thermal plume along the high-temperature walls heated by the solar radiation during the daytime, especially in windless or breezy sunny day [37] . Fan et al. [38] measured boundary layer structure along the sunward surface of a sixteen-storey building in Guangzhou, and concluded that the maximum velocity in the boundary layer at a height of 50 m is about 1.0-1.5 m/s with absent wind and a wall/air temperature difference of 14-20 K. Such strong thermal flow should not be neglected since the most common wind speed in the urban environment is in the range of 1.0-2.0 m/s [39] . Hence the buoyancy forces basically generated by solar radiation will be a particular consideration in this paper. Over the past dozen years, several literature published about the combined wind and thermal flow patterns in urban region. Xie et al. [40] calculated a set of CFD simulation cases to investigate the impact of solar radiation on pollutant dispersion in different street layouts and estimated the relative strength of thermally/ mechanically induced flow using the ratio of Gr/Re 2 . It was found that solar calefaction of a windward surface in a street canyon would give rise to an increase in pollutant concentration of the canyon. Richards et al. [41] performed wind tunnel measurements to simulate the thermal effects within the vicinity of a onefold building with leeward facade heating with the same parameter Gr/Re 2 . They concluded that compared with the isothermal condition, the leeward recirculation lengths were shorter for both cases of Gr/Re 2 = 0.9 and 1.6 (non-isothermal conditions). The velocity field and temperature distribution within the recirculation area were obviously different between two non-isothermal cases. Larsen and Heiselberg [42] carried out a group of wind tunnel tests to create a scene of single-sided natural ventilation driven by wind pressure and temperature difference. They gave the velocity profiles and air-change rates in the openings, which greatly varied from wind force dominating to buoyant force governing. Bangalee et al. [43] set four different open window modes to investigate the flow structures of fluid-driven natural cross-ventilation. They found that a larger volumetric flow rate did not always ensure better replacement of the indoor air, and vice versa. Dama and Angeli [44] designed three cases on the wind and buoyancy induced natural ventilation in double skin facades and compared two flow patterns derived from a simplified building simulation model and CFD. Their results showed that CFD analysis can provide a deeper insight on surface-level heat transfer. Most of the studies mainly paid attention to the heat and mass transfer around a single building block or building arrays, but there is a lack of research work on the cross-contamination mechanism through outer window flush driven by the combined buoyancy and wind effect.",

            "text": "According to the wind-driven airflow around a bluff body under normal wind direction [45] , there is a stagnation zone formed at the 2/ 3 height of the building on the windward side. The airflow above the stagnation zone goes toward the building top, while the airflow below the stagnation zone goes downward to the ground. The wall thermal plume can drive the gaseous pollutants released from lower unit to go to upper ones, especially in high-rise buildings. When the heated wall is on the windward side, the near wall airflow direction will change with the variation of the relative force of buoyancy and wind, notably in the approaching wind downward flow region in front of the building (Fig. 1 ). If the buoyant force is stronger, the flow patterns at the window opening should be inflows at the lower part and outflows at the upper part. When the wind force is stronger, the flow direction at the window opening can be downward. The purpose of the present work is to quantitatively explore the aforementioned phenomenon, namely the airflow field and pollutant transmission under effects of wind and thermal forces. A hypothetical twenty-storey high-rise building with single-sided ventilation is modelled as the research object. To quantitatively clarify the effect of solar radiation on the exterior wall surface of the building, the intensity of solar radiation on a certain day is calculated. Since the single-sided natural ventilation is usually used in transition season, we select a typical day from transition season as representative. Then the temperature difference between the heated wall and the ambient air is calculated using a simplified energy balance model of the building envelop. Finally, to analyse the influence of the wind and wall thermal plume flow on the pollutant transmission characteristics, the tracer gas method is employed in the numerical simulation. The results of present work are helpful for a profound understanding of how solar radiation and near-wall flow affect the vertical inter-flat contaminant transmission routes, and the results also reveal the combined effect of wind force and buoyancy lift on the pollutant dispersion near the building. To quantify the strength of the natural convection adjacent to the wall, the temperature difference between the building surface and the ambient air should be clarified. The solar radiation intensity has a strong influence on the wall heating process, which needs to be quantified first. The wall temperature can be obtained by the heat balance calculation afterwards. The parameters of meteorology and building envelope refer to those of Shanghai, a city of hot/humid climate zone in China.",

During 11:00 to 13:00, the solar radiation intensity on the sunward side is in a small range of 410-440 W/m 2 , while that of the opposite side is about 165 W/ m 2 .

The results are shown in Table 2 . The solar radiation intensity is an average value of 11:00-13:00. It is observed that the temperature of the sunward outer surface is 10 K higher than the shady side, and 13 K higher than the outdoor air temperature. The calculation results are compared with the experimental data from Wang et al. [55] . Note: The atmospheric transparency is 0.62 [47] [48] [49] . During 11:00 to 13:00, the south face is sunward, while the north face is shady side. They selected a 40 m height rectangular student dormitory as the target building and measured several parameters including external wall temperature, wind speed, solar intensity and air temperature in April 7th and 16th in 2010. During their test process, the solar radiation received by the south wall at 11:00-13:00 was in the range of 300-350 W/m 2 , the wind speed was below 4 m/s and the ambient temperature was 285-288 K. The temperature on the sunward surface varied with height. The largest difference between bottom and top was 2.5 K. The measured average temperature difference between the external south wall and ambient at 11:00-13:00 was 12-18 K. The calculation result in the present work is relatively small compared with the aforementioned measurements. In view of the other influence factors such as the wall thermal conductivity and radiation heat transfer, a 13 K temperature difference can be considered as a reasonable value. In the following numerical simulation, considering the computation accuracy for airflow on the windward side and the mesh quantity, the heated sunward and shady side walls are placed at the windward side in different cases separately. That is, in some cases the windward wall is sunward and in some cases it is shady side.",

Six rooms in this building are focused on, which fall into three groups and each group contains two neighboring units, respectively the 2nd, 3rd, 10th, 11th, 18th and 19th floors along the middle column of the building windward facade, which are located at the lower, middle and upper positon of the building separately. The dimensions of the concerned rooms are 2.9 m height(y), 3 m length(z), 3.6 m width(x). The window dimensions of each room are height (y) \u00d7 width(z) = 1.5 m \u00d7 0.9 m. The bottom of the window frame is 0.9 m above the room floor. The dimensions of each room and window are in accordance with our previous wind tunnel tests [29, 30] . The computational domain for the concerned cases is a rectangular zone surrounding the objective building. The domain size is carefully designed, considering both efficiency and accuracy. According to Franke et al. [56] , the blockage ratio of the domain should be below 3%, which is about 1.8% in the present study.",

The turbulence on the inlet boundary is characterized by turbulence intensity and length scale, which are 10% and 1 m [25, 59] , respectively. The turbulent effect is simulated by the renormalization group (RNG) k-\u025b model [60] with enhanced wall treatment. The pressure-velocity coupling algorithm is SIMPLE. The pressure interpolation method is a staggered scheme named PRESTO. The discretization scheme used for the other variables except the pressure is second order upwind to ensure the computational precision. As to the pollutant transmission, a 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m 3 tiny cube at the middle of the window is assigned as the source, located at the 2nd, 10th and 18th floor respectively in each case. Propane (C 3 H 8 ) [26] [27] [28] , as a tracer gas of gaseous pollutants, is generated at a constant mass flow rate of 8 mg/ s [25, 31] . It takes more than 10000 iterations for every simulation to reach the convergence. The calculations are terminated when the residuals do not show any further reduction and maintain at a reasonable level. The convergent values of residuals are as following: 10 \u22124 for continuity, 10 \u22125 for k, \u025b, x-, y-and z-velocity, 10 \u22126 for concentration and 10 \u22128 for energy. The solutions, such as the air velocity, temperature and concentration at specific points, are stable or appear steady quasi-periodic variations with acceptable fluctuation amplitudes. The amplitudes of velocity and concentration values at specific points show significant ones in the buoyancy driven windless case, which are all below 8%. Considering the effects of window active status, wind speed, temperature difference and source location, totally 78 cases are calculated. Table 3 shows 26 sets of configuration based on the airflow field without the influence of source, and these cases are divided into four groups according to the window condition and the temperature difference. \"C\" means close window mode and \"O\" means open window mode. A 13 K temperature difference represents that the building windward wall faces the sun, while a 3.5 K temperature difference means that the windward wall is the shady side.",

The RNG k-\u025b model combined with enhanced wall treatment is used again for reproducing the airflow field feature. Fig. 8 shows the streamlines at the middle x-y section obtained by numerical simulation. The comparisons of four velocity profiles at the middle x-y section between simulation and experiment are shown in Fig. 9 . The positive value of U/U ref means the airflow direction is the plus x direction, and the negative one means the airflow move to the minus x direction. It can be seen that the backflow vortex at the bottom before the cubic model in Fig. 9 (a) (line -H/2) and Fig. 9 (b) (line -H/ 25), the reverse flow on the roof in Fig. 9 (c) (line H/2) and the recirculation zone in the downstream region in Fig. 9 (d) (line 1.5H) are captured by the present simulation. The simulated velocity distributions are satisfactory compared with the measurement except along the line 1.5H behind the model. The minus simulated velocities at the lower section of the line 1.5H mean that RNG k-\u025b model predicts a mildly larger separation region in the wake flow of a bluff body. Despite the slight inaccuracy of RNG k-\u025b model in the prediction of the vortexshedding effects in the building wake, the calculations of the airflow field inside the cubic model and in the upstream areas near and beside to the windward fa\u00e7ade agree well with the experimental results. It is sufficient to justify the application of RNG k-\u025b model in the present main concern of inter-flat pollutant transmission on the windward side and the qualitative pollutant distribution behind the building.",

In Fig. 10(I1) , Ri = 156.9, the buoyancy lift is dominant. The thermal plume along the windward surface can be observed distinctly and the flow over the building roof moves downstream toward the high sky. The wall thermal flow velocity at the building height is up to 1.2 m/s. The airflow near the leeward surface is upward. Since the thermal air from upstream flows to the upper space of downstream, the air density and pressure of the upper zone are smaller than those of the lower zone. That should be one of the main reasons for the upgrade airflow on the leeward side. In Fig. 10(I3) , the coming wind speed at the building height is 0.8 m/s, the corresponding Ri is 39.2. It can be seen that the wall flow scope is weakened due to the suppression effect of the approaching wind. The airflow above the roof and behind the building is more likely to go to the downstream rather than to the higher altitude. A reverse vortex can be observed behind the building. In Fig. 10(I4) , the corresponding Ri is 25.1. The airflow closely adhering to the windward wall still tends to go upward. The velocity magnitude near the windward wall is below 0.5 m/s. A small backflow vortex forms at the windward bottom area. As the approaching wind speed goes up, and the temperature difference is constant, a stagnation zone shows between 16th and 17th floor on the windward side, as shown in Fig. 10(I7) . The downward flow below the stagnation zone has a velocity magnitude of about 1.0 m/s. The near wall upward thermal flow is severely restrained. The recirculation vortexes on the leeward side can be observed. Because of the relatively high wind speed, the airflow pattern in this case is almost the same with the pure wind driven airflow around a bluff body [45] .",

To observe the pollutant transmission routes and compare the concentration distributions, Fig. 11 gives the tracer gas In Case I3, the Ri number is reduced from 156.9 to 39.2, the infected area on the windward side reflects a peach-like shape around the source unit. Both the vertical and horizontal transmissions are limited. Part of tracer gas can be taken to the front of building because of the backflow at the windward bottom region, and then spread to the lateral side. In Case I4, the upward transmission on the windward side is totally suppressed by the downward coming wind, the tracer gas spread toward the ground and to the downstream with airflow, which means the buoyancy lift is weaker than the approaching wind at lower height. In Case I7, the infected area is mainly restricted at the bottom in front of the building, which is influenced by the bottom airflow vortex when the approaching wind is ruling. For the region behind the building, the concentration magnitude is mostly below 10 \u22126 . In Case I1, although the thermal plume is dominant, the gentle wind still takes a part of tracer gas bypassing the lateral side to the leeward side during the upward transmission process along the windward surface. In Case I3 and Case I4, where the Ri number is 69.7 and 39.2 respectively, the affected phenomenon is relatively more obvious due to the horizontal dispersion from the windward side and the upward near wall airflow on the leeward side. When the Ri number decreases to a relatively low value of 2.5, in Case I7, the tracer gas mainly moves to the upstream with the bottom backflow and then to the lateral. When the source location is at the windward 10th floor, the vertical coverage area of 10 \u22126 -1 range along the windward wall is from the source floor to above the building top and still shows a symmetric shape in Case I1. Since the thermal flow speed is faster at the upper height of the building, the windward tracer gas is brought to high altitude quickly, so the leeward space is barely affected. In Case I3, the wind speed is higher than in Case I1, the effect of the near wall thermal flow is weakened. The tracer gas still goes up to the top of the building and the vertical coverage area is smaller than that in Case I1, while wider in horizontal direction. Part of tracer gas can cross the building roof moving to the downstream and the upper space on the leeward side is affected. In Case I4, due to the low velocity along the windward wall, the tracer gas tends to spread in a small region around the source on the windward side. The region behind the building also suffers. As the Ri number reduces to 2.5 in Case I7, the wind effect is dominant, the windward covered area seems like raindrop going downward because of the vertical downward airflow. The leeward space is affected, but slightly less than the former case.",

The units on the leeward side are softly affected in Case I4. Overall, in the buoyancy lift governing cases (II-II3), the tracer gas mainly spreads from source unit to the upper ones on the windward side. In the two forces equivalent cases (II4), the tracer gas mainly disperses horizontally from windward side to leeward side. In the wind force ruling cases (II5-II8), the tracer gas mainly moves from the source unit to the lower ones on the windward side. Fig. 12 illustrates the tracer gas mass fraction distributions along the windward wall in each case of group II and group III. The overall tendency of group II is similar with that of group I, the close window mode. In the windless case II1, the velocity of vertical upward flow adjacent to the wall increases with height. So compared with the source location at 2nd floor, the tracer gas releasing from the 10th floor moves upward faster and has a longer vertical coverage. When the source is located at the 18th floor, the tracer gas covers a wider range at the horizontal direction in Case II7 where the wind force is ruling than that in II1 under buoyancy lift dominated condition. In group III, the temperature difference is 3.5 K. Under the same breeze condition, the vertical upward transmission in Case III1 is weaker than Case II1 due to the smaller thermal plume. In Case III5 and III7, the Ri number is less than 7, the wind force is predominant. With the source releasing from the 10th floor, the shape of tracer gas coverage is like raindrop as mentioned above and the breadth of the raindrop decreases from Case III5 to III7, while the raindrop length increases. The reason is the growing downward airflow speed below the stagnation zone.",

There's inside/outside heat transfer and air exchange through openings, resulting in inter-flat transmission. The mean indoor air temperature in each room of group II is shown in Fig. 13 . Since the heat conduction from the building envelope is neglected in the simulation, the indoor air temperature can be slightly underestimated. One common thing can be observed from the profiles that for two neighbor flats, the mean indoor air temperature in the upper one is higher than that in the lower one. As for the differences, the profiles of eight cases can be divided into three classes according to the variation tendencies of 3rd \u2192 10th and 11th \u2192 18th. Class one contains three cases under the condition when the approaching wind speed is in the range of 0.4 m/s -0.8 m/s and the buoyant lift dominates the near wall airflow. In this class, the mean indoor air temperature in the concerned room increases with height, which should contribute to a stronger thermal plume at a higher height. For a certain flat, the temperature level increases with Ri number. The reason is that a higher approaching wind can take away more heat by convection, so less heat enters in the room, resulting in a relatively lower indoor temperature. Class two refers to cases with the wind speed of 1.0 m/s and 1.2 m/s. The slope from 3rd to 10th floor is negative, while from 11th to 18th floor is positive. The reason might be that the thermal flow is suppressed below the stagnation zone, whereas it still exists at the higher region. Class three contains three wind force dominated cases. The slopes of both 3rd \u2192 10th and 11th \u2192 18th are negative. Since the downward airflow is strong at the lower half part of the building height, the wall heat also transfers downward. In general, the indoor/ambient air temperature difference is in the range of 2 Ke6 K. The ACH (air exchange rate) is calculated by an integral method [62] , see Eq. (11),",

Since the airflow from outside is likely to form a small circuit at the opening window and the effective depth of fresh air is limited, the calculation result by this method is considered to be slightly higher than the tracer gas decay method, but the value is testified very close to the empirical models [25] . The ACH values of six concerned units in different cases are listed in Fig. 14. In general, the ACH values change in a big range of 0.5-10. When the Ri numbers are approximate, the ACH values in group II are mostly higher than those in group III. Take Case II4 (U ref = 1.0 m/s, \u0394T=13 K, Ri = 25.1) and III2 (U ref = 0.5 m/s, \u0394T=3.5 K, Ri = 27.5) as an example, the Ri numbers in these two cases are very close, while the ACH value in the former case is 1.5-2.0 times that of in the latter case for the same room. The reference coming wind speed in the former case is twice that of in the latter one. The temperature difference between the outer windward wall and the ambient in Case II4 is higher than in Case III2, so the thermal plume in Case II4 is stronger. These phenomena also appear in other corresponding conditions, such as Case II5 and Case III3, Case II6 and Case III4. This might be concluded that under the coupling effect of wind force and buoyancy lift, the relative magnitude of wind and thermal plume is quite crucial for ACH value of the room. Another thing can be found from Fig. 14 is that in the wind force predominant cases when Ri < 5 (II7, II8, III7, III8, Ref1, Ref2), the ACH values are lower than those in the buoyancy lift governing conditions or the two forces equivalent cases (II1-II4 and III1-III3), except for the 19th floor.",

In Case II1, Ri = 156.9, the reentry ratios for the middle units, the 10th and 11th floors, are around 1%, and the magnitude for the upper units are 0.1%. When the Ri is 69.7, the reentry ratios for the middle units are in a range of 0.1%-0.2%, and for the upper units are at a magnitude of 0.01%. When the Ri decreases to 42.9, the reentry ratios for the middle units are below 0.1%. In the isothermal cases, the tracer gas cannot go upward.",

In the previous numerical simulation of cascade effect, the indoor/outdoor temperature difference was 5 K, and the ACH values were both 10.08 in the two concerned rooms under windless condition. The pollutant was generated by a point source in the room with a constant mass flow rate of 8 mg/s. It was found that in a windless day, around 7.5% of the exhaust air from lower unit can re-enter into the upper one, while it's around 25% in the present work. Different mechanisms can be one of the main reasons for the differences on reentry ratio values. In the indoor/outdoor temperature difference driven mode, cold flow enters from the lower part of the window and thermal flow exits from the upper part. The outflow from indoor will not go upward exactly along the wall but have a certain distance with the wall. In the present study, the upward thermal plume is adhering to the wall, so the tracer gas moving with airflow is easier brought into the upper floor, causing a higher reentry ratio. Besides, the source locations and sampling methods of mean concentration may also have influences on the different values of reentry ratio.",

The reentry ratios are all over 20%, especially when Ri numbers are below 1, the R values can be up to 30% or even 40%. One thing should be noticed that, for two isothermal cases, both of the reentry ratios exceed 50%, more than twice those of buoyancy lift ruling cases (II1-II3, III1-III2). Compared with the buoyancy force dominant cases, the ACH values in the isothermal cases are much smaller, which means the tracer gas is easier to stay in the source room rather than exhaust to another room. So the specific values M i-j are lower in the isothermal modes. According to Eq. (13), the reentry ratio is closely related to the concentration ratio and air exchange rate ratio of two units. Take the buoyancy forced Case I1 and isothermal Case Ref1 as the comparison objectives. In Case I1, the concentration ratio between 19th and 18th is about 1/5 while the ACH ratio is almost 1. Thus the reentry ratio is close to 20%. In Case Ref1, the concentration ratio between 19th and 18th is about 1/8 while the ACH ratio is approximate 4. So the reentry ratio is up to 50%. Similarity rules can be found between isothermal cases and combined wind and buoyancy effects forces cases. In general, the upstairs residents should pay more attention to the intervention measures on the control of contamination risk.",

The present work pays attention to this factor, and also the coupling effect of approaching wind and near wall thermal plume originating from solar radiation. The different influences between the sunward surface and shady side surface are compared. Richardson number is adopted to represent the combined effect of buoyancy lift and wind. The pollutant dispersion routes on the windward side under different Ri number cases are analysed. For a 58 m high building at noon of a typical day of transition season in Shanghai, the near wall thermal plume speed at the building height is up to 1.2 m/s. For the pollutant transmission, the source is released from a point at a constant intensity. The following conclusions can be obtained:",

The reentry ratio of the flat immediately above the source is around 25%. However, for the isothermal condition, the vertically upward transmission is only possible above the stagnation zone, and the reentry ratio can be up to more than 50%. For source location below the stagnation zone conditions, the pollutants disperse from the middle of the building to bottom with the downward flow in the isothermal cases. (2) As to the comparisons between the sunward and shady side, both of two surfaces are placed at the windward side. Take the gentle breeze cases as contrast objects, the results show that when the source is released from the bottom flat of the building, the vertical upward coverage length of tracer gas on the shady side surface is nearly half of that on the sunward surface. Both of the reentry ratio values of the flat immediately above the source are almost 20%. (3) In terms of the combined effect of wind and buoyancy forces, multiple cases are set for relevant analysis and investigation. The assigned dimensionless number, Ri, is helpful for summarizing the results. When the source location is above the stagnation zone, the pollutant always goes up with the rising airflow. Under the conditions of the source location below the stagnation zone, as the Ri number decreases, the effect of force convection strengthens, so the pollutant spread from lower floor to upper ones is weakened. As the source located at the 2nd floor, the vertical upgrade transmission is suppressed once Ri is lower than 40. When the source is released from the 10th floor, the vertical upward transmission is restrained once Ri is smaller than 20.",

There are still many limitations in the present study. The airflow patterns around an isolated building under different meteorological conditions are diverse. The direction of approaching wind has been proved as one of the main influencing factors, which is not considered in this paper. Besides, the near wall flow features are distinct in daylight and night, also in different seasons. In addition, the calculations in this paper are based on steady-state simulations without considering the effect of time-dependent dynamics on heat and mass transfer. The selection of more applicable dimensionless numbers can be another issue, since a global Ri number has limitations to reflect a local pollutant dispersion phenomenon for a large scale problem, such as in the high-rise building. Further investigations are worthy to be done on the above matters.",

In the numerical simulation, the computational domain had a height of 5H, an upstream length of 5H, a downstream length of 10H, and a lateral length of 5 L on both sides. The inflow velocity profile in the x-direction followed a logarithmic law, U (y) = (U ref /\u03ba) ln(y/y ref ), where \u03ba is the Von Karman constant, 0.41, and y ref has a value of 0.005 m. The velocity components in the other two directions are zero. The turbulence on the inlet boundary is given by turbulence intensity and length scale, which are 10% and 0.25 m, respectively.
