Documentation of virus infection using PCR and clinical characteristics of patients affected with viral pneumonia are reviewed in this study. Methods: 51 children less than three years admitted to the Pediatric Hospital, Cairo University with viral pneumonia were included. All patients had undergone nasopharyngeal aspirate for PCR viral detection. Results: A total of 51 cases were enrolled in the study, of which 7 cases were negative while 44 children were positive for viruses. The most common respiratory virus was Rhinovirus in 32 patients (72.2%), then parainfluenza virus (PIV) in 12 (27.3%), of which subtypes PIV1 were 2 (4.5%), PIV3 were 5 (11.4%) and PIV4 were 5 (11.4%) cases. The third common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 9 (20.5%) cases of which 3 (6.8%) were RSVA and 6 (13.6%) were RSVB and adenovirus in 9 cases (20.5%). Boca virus was found in 8 (18.2%) patients, corona virus 2 (4.5%) patients, H1N1 2 (4.5%) patients, enterovirus 2 patients (4.5%) and human metapneumovirus in one case (2.3%). Influenza B and PIV2 were not detected. Coinfection was found in 28 (63.7%). Mortality occurred in 12 (23.5%). There was no significant relation between virus type or coinfection with disease severity. Conclusions: RV was the most commonly detected virus in children under 3 years admitted with acute lower respiratory tract infections. Coinfection was present in the majority of our patients; however it was not related significantly to parameters of disease severity.",

            "text": "Detection of viral acute lower respiratory tract infection in hospitalized infants using real-time PCR Introduction Viral pathogens account for a large proportion of community acquired pneumonia cases. 1 It is estimated to cause 30-70% of the cases of pneumonia. 2, 3 For children with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) treated as outpatients, a virological diagnosis is often not sought, since the diagnosis does not lead to specific therapy. Most respiratory viruses can cause ALRTI of variable severities. 4 The conundrum of diagnosing viral pneumonia arises from the lack of understanding of the viral etiology in clinical setting. In addition, collecting the appropriate sample from infants and young children is challenging owing to the difficulty in collecting these samples in this age group. It is still difficult to differentiate between viral and bacterial pneumonia using non-specific indirect methods such as blood culture or diagnostic serology. 5 Moreover the use of conventional methods of viral detection as serology and viral culture has lead to underestimation of the role of viruses as a cause of ALRTI. 6 The use of PCR has gained a lot of attention recently as it permits identification of more than one virus in the same respiratory specimen that has previously been difficult to culture. In the past decade, new respiratory viruses causing ALRTI had been discovered, the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by coronavirus, and the avian influenza type A (H5N1) pandemics are recent examples. 6, 7 The present study aims at investigating the epidemiology of viral infection using multiplex real time PCR, and exploring the clinical spectrum of the affected children in relation to viral type, during the winter season in hospitalized children with viral pneumonia.",

A study performed on children with acute respiratory illness analyzed the viral detection capacities of culture, direct immunofluorescence, and multiplex PCR found PCR to be the most sensitive method detecting a viral cause in 91.5% of children in their nasal samples. 14 Multiplex PCR enabled laboratorians to detect a panel of viruses simultaneously while reducing hands on time and with greater analytical sensitivity. 15 There are several multiplex assays evaluated for detection of respiratory viruses.

During the study period there was a major fear of swine flu infection (H1N1) that raised public health alert for fear of fatal influenza pneumonia. Though influenza causes fever without localization with lack of respiratory symptoms, it makes these children not eligible for the study. In our study only 2 cases with H1N1 were detected out of 44 cases, those infected had an underlying congenital heart disease and required intensive care admission and mechanical ventilation but with no case fatality.",
