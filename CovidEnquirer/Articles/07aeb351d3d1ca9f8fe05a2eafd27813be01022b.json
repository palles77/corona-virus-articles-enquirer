Recently, aqueous extracts of Toona sinensis leaves (TSL-1) have demonstrated many biological effects both in vitro and in vivo. In the central nervous system, microglial activation and their proinflammatory responses are considered an important therapeutic strategy for neuroinflammatory disorders such as cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The present study attempted to validate the effect of TSL-1 on microglia-mediated neuroinflammation stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As inflammatory parameters, the production of nitric oxide (NO), inducible NO synthase, and tumor necrosis factor-a were evaluated. Our results demonstrate that TSL-1 suppresses LPS-induced NO production, tumor necrosis factor-a secretion, and inducible NO synthase protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner, without causing cytotoxicity. In addition, the inhibitory effects of TSL-1 in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia were extended to post-treatment suggesting the therapeutic potential of TSL-1. Therefore, this work provides the future evaluation of the role of TSL-1 in the treatment of",

Microglia act as the major immune cells in the central nervous system. In response to brain injury or during neurodegenerative processes, microglia are activated by secreting growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species [3,8e11] . Although microglial activation is necessary and important for host defense, over-activation of microglia is neurotoxic. Studies have shown that microglia activated after ischemic stroke will produce cytokines to trigger neuronal death in response to ischemic injury [6, 12] . They also found that the inhibition of inflammation would prevent the progressive brain loss following a stroke. Thus, to develop the agents that reduce microglial activation and their proinflammatory responses is considered an important therapeutic strategy for neuroinflammatory disorders such as cerebral ischemia, AD, and PD.",

In addition, TSL-1 has antiproliferative properties in human lung cancer cells [25e28], oral squamous carcinoma cells [29] , and human premyelocytic leukemia cells [30] in vitro. Furthermore, there was no acute lethal effect even at a maximal oral tested dose of 5000 mg/kg of body weight in mice [31, 32] . Interestingly, one of these findings demonstrated that daily dietary supplement of TSL-1 in senescence-accelerated mice (an AD model) improved brain degeneration caused by the incidence of b amyloid plaques [17] . This points to the possibility that TSL-1 may pass through the bloodebrain barrier to affect the central nervous system. Recent studies have also found that the appearance of amyloid plaques in the brain coincides with a dramatic phenotypic activation of the surrounding microglia, which release proinflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic substances, for disease progression [33, 34] . Liao et al.'s findings [17] indicated that TSL-1 supplement in aged mice had a potential effect on neuroinflammation due to the recruitment of activated microglia in amyloid plaques. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether TSL-1 would modulated neuroinflammation-associated diseases such as AD through microglia. At the same time, because the systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a heat-stable bacterial cell wall component) in mouse brain, causing amyloid protein accumulation and neuroinflammation, was being used to study the underlying mechanisms of AD [35e37], we tested the potential anti-inflammation effect of TSL-1 in the in vitro model of LPS-induced microglial activation system.",

This anti-inflammatory effect of TS was also evidenced by inhibiting TNF-a release. Moreover, the cell viability assay showed that treatment with TSL-1 alone did not have cytotoxic effects at concentrations of 5e50 mg/ mL, whereas TSL-1 significantly inhibited those inflammatory factors stimulated by LPS. In this connection, we suggest that TSL-1 might have a potent antineuroinflammatory activity via the inhibition of LPS-stimulated production of TNF-a, NO, as well as iNOS protein in microglia.",

The results indicated that even post-treatment with TSL-1 (50 mg/mL), later than LPS application, is effective in the reduction of NO release and iNOS protein level. Accumulating evidence indicates that iNOS is the most important contributor to NO production in the brain after inflammatory assault, compared with other isoforms of NOS, namely eNOS and nNOS [42, 43] . Furthermore, a novel approach with NO-donating nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs develops a safe profile that strongly reduces their untoward side effects without altering the anti-inflammatory effectiveness [44e47]. These findings correlate the important role of NO in the function of the central nervous system. In the central nervous system, activated microglia are the major cellular source of iNOS. Therefore, the inhibitory effect that TSL-1 exerts on iNOS might be beneficial not only in the protection of neurons but also as therapy through microglia.",

Of these compounds, gallic acid isolated directly from TSL-1 has been demonstrated to possess effective antioxidant activity against various oxidative stress such as leukemia, atherogenesis, prostate cancer, oral carcinoma, and angiogenesis in the liver, kidney, and testis [18, 24, 29, 30, 49, 50] . Quercetin purified from TSL-1 specifically elevates the activities of antioxidant enzymes only in the testis [50] . In the central nervous system, gallic acid and quercetin have also been found to reduce neuronal damage by inhibiting microglia-mediated NO release, TNF-a production, and oxidative stress [51e55].

            "text": "The application of traditional Chinese herbs for medicinal use has attracted attention in recent years. Increasing evidence has suggested that Chinese herbs have therapeutic effects on neurodegenerative diseases such as PD and AD through their anti-inflammatory features [56e58]. These traditional Chinese medicines, such as the extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. and Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge, or the more recently studied grape seed extract, have been shown to promote neuronal survival and neurite growth, to facilitate functional recovery after brain injury, and to act as inhibitors of neuroinflammatory toxicity of activated-microglia. However, it has been proposed that an exacerbated inflammatory response was responsible for causing the impairment in the phagocytosis of amyloid protein deposits by microglia in the AD brain. In this connection, the discovery of agents that are capable of increasing amyloid protein uptake by phagocytic cells is of potential therapeutic interest for AD. In fact, with amyloid b treatment, the blockade of chloride intracellular ion channel 1 will stimulate amyloid b phagocytosis in microglia while inhibiting iNOS induction and TNFa production [59, 60] . In the present study, pretreatment with TSL-1 has proved protective against LPS-induced microglial activation. Treatment with TSL-1 at 0 hours and 1 hour post-LPS treatment also exhibited similar degrees of antineuroinflammatory effect comparable to that observed with pretreatment. Therefore, it is likely that the attenuation of LPS-stimulated NO release and NO production are at least partially responsible for neuroinflammation of TSL-1. However, the potential effect of TSL-1 in modifying microglial activation with enhancing amyloid b clearance needs to be addressed.",

Because therapeutic agents from herbal sources are usually perceived as being natural and devoid of side effects. It is reasonable to consider TSL-1 as another potential therapeutic agent that works by inhibiting the inflammatory response of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases. To confirm its effect, further studies in in vivo animal models are necessary.",

The bar graph shows the densitometric analysis for five blots from four independent experiments (mean AE standard deviation). Betaactin was used as internal control.*p < 0.05 versus the LPStreated alone group.",

Nitrite levels in cultured media were determined by Griess assay and were reflected to NO levels. Sodium nitrite was used for preparing the standard curve. (B) Total cells lysates were obtained 24 hours after LPS (1 mg/mL) treatment. Equal amounts of cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-inducible NO synthase-specific antibody. Densitometric values indicate the relative ratio of inducible NO synthase/b-actin. Data are expressed as a percentage of the LPS alone values.
