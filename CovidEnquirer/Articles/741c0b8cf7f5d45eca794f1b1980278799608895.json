There is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine to reduce its pandemic potential. In the present study, we evaluated the biochemical characteristics and immunogenicity of two H7 virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of the matrix 1 (M1) and hemagglutinin of wild-type (HA-WT) or hemagglutinin of whose transmembrane domain replaced by that from H3N2 subtype (HA-TM). H7 VLPs-WT and H7 VLPs-TM could assemble and release into the supernatant of Sf9 cells and they had similar morphological characteristics. However, compared to H7 VLPs-WT, H7 VLPs-TM had more trimeric HA proteins and could better resist thermal changes. In mice H7 VLPs-TM induced higher titers of HI, IgG, IgG2a and IFN-c, and provided better protection against homologous and heterologous H7N9 viruses (no matter belonging to Yangtze River Delta or Pearl River Delta) challenge with less weight loss and higher survival rate. In summary, H7 VLPs-TM represents a potential strategy for the development of H7N9 vaccines.",

Until February 28, 2018 , there were 1625 laboratory confirmed human cases of infection [1] , with a fatality rate of approximately 38%, causing an unprecedented threat to public health and poultry industry [2, 3] . Although human-to-human transmission hasn't been reported, H7N9 virus has caused five epidemic waves in China, evolving into two main diversified lineages: Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) lineages based on hemagglutinin (HA) genes [4] [5] [6] . Viruses of the YRD lineage reacted less well with post-infection ferret antiserum raised against the PRD candidate vaccine [7] , indicated a remarkable difference of antigenicity between the two lineages. Highly pathogenic (HP) H7N9 virus belonging to the PRD lineage was first reported in late February 2017, indicated the continued evolution of H7N9 virus [8] [9] [10] .",

Two H7 VLPs were automatically assembled by HA-WT/TM and M1 proteins from H7N9-53 expressed by Bac-to-Bac expression system and named H7 VLPs-WT and H7 VLPs-TM.

Through electron microscopy observation, negatively stained H7 VLPs-WT/TM presented influenza virion shape, with a diameter ranging from 80 to 120 nm, and showed typical spikes on the surfaces as H7N9 viral particles, except for the empty inside (Fig. 1A) .

Only one mouse immunized with H7 VLPs-WT lost more than 20% body weight at 7 days post infection of H7N9-ZSM. Mice immunized with PBS were euthanized when there was a !20% weight loss, and the survival rate is 0 after challenged with any of the three H7N9 viruses (Fig. 5B, D, F) .

But the safety and efficacy of protection in vivo remain to be improved. In the present work, we dedicated to enhancing cross-protection of H7 VLPs by increasing trimeric HA molecules. HA is a metastable trimeric surface glycoprotein that undergoes extensive conformational rearrangements at low pH [33] , and the previous work of our team had proved influenza virus HA subunit vaccines could enhance cross-protection against challenge after increasing the trimeric HA proteins [26] . Moreover, other researches confirmed this strategy in inactivated vaccine of influenza viruses [34] [35] [36] . But the application to VLPs was the first time, and the results demonstrated that H7 VLPs with the replacement of H3N2 TM domain possessed more trimeric HA proteins and provided better protection against homologous and heterologous challenge. This strategy provides a good idea to alleviate the development of universal influenza vaccines.",

PRD lineage refers to Guangdong, and this region had the second largest number of H7N9. Moreover, HP variants of H7N9 viruses have caused human deaths and poultry outbreaks in PRD lineage. In this work, seven H7N9 isolates from YRD lineage and one isolate from PRD lineage were used, and the amino acid sequences homology was 98.2-99.8%. H7 VLPs was formed by HA and M1 from H7N9-53 belonging to YRD lineage, and heterologous viruses H7N9-MCX and H7N9-ZSM were used for challenge. H7N9-MCX, belonging to YRD lineage, has the lowest homology with H7N9-53. H7N9-ZSM, belonging to PRD lineage, was isolated recently and we want to explore the cross-lineage protection of our VLPs.

H7N9 vaccines appear to be poorly immunogenic in that they induce lower levels of HI antibodies compared with titers induced by human seasonal influenza viruses [39, 40] . Kamal et al. pointed out that a large fraction of the antibodies induced by H7 WIV was non-neutralizing in vitro, and the antibodies directed against the HA head could completely protect mice against homologous viral challenge despite the low level of HI and neutralizing antibodies [41] . As to VLPs in this report, H7 VLPs-WT/TM induced high levels of IgG and HI antibodies and completely protected mice against challenge with the homologous and heterologous viruses belonging to YRD lineage, but H7 VLPs-WT/TM elicited high IgG antibodies and low HI antibodies (1:10 and 1:60 for H7 VLPs-WT and H7 VLPs-TM, respectively) to H7N9-ZSM belonging to PRD lineage. Notably, H7 VLPs-WT/TM could also provide protection against H7N9-ZSM (only one mice immunized with H7 VLPs-WT euthanized for lost more than 20% initial weight and was considered dead) despite low HI titers which coincides with the former conclusion that nonneutralizing antibodies in H7N9 may play an important role in the anti-viral process and the HI titer may not completely correlate with protection against H7N9 influenza virus [41] [42] [43] .",
