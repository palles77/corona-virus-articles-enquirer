In all these countries, buffaloes represent only a very small portion of total livestock, except in Egypt, where buffaloes are more numerous than cattle.

Bulls in the breeding stations are provided by development programmes of the government or other agencies. Due to dif\u00aeculties in oestrus detection and lack of organization, arti\u00aecial insemination (AI) is still practised only to a very limited extent for buffaloes in the Mediterranean region: in Italy for 2.5% of the buffaloes, in Egypt and Iran for 0.5% and in Romania for 0.1%. In the large cooperative and state farms in Bulgaria, AI is used on 80% of the buffaloes. In the other countries it is not used at all. The low use of AI has slowed down the implementation of national selection schemes for genetic improvement of milk productivity. Research trials conducted in Italy have indicated that arti\u00aecial insemination is feasible and successful in buffaloes using the following technique to synchronize oestrus and boost fertility. A progesterone-releasing intravaginal device (PRID) of silicon coils is inserted and left for 10 days; on the 7th day injections of 1000 IU of eCG (equine chorionic gonadotrophin) and 15 mg of luprostiol (prostaglandin F 2a ) are given; arti\u00aecial insemination is performed at 48, 72 and 96 h after removal of the PRID on day 10.",

Classifying the types of The more common classi\u00aecation of cheese is based on the type of coagulation: either enzymatic coagulation (by rennet), or acid coagulation (after natural acidi-\u00aecation or by the action of lactic bacteria). Most of the cheeses produced in the Mediterranean area, including Mozzarella, belong to the acid-enzymatic category, meaning that acid coagulation prevails. The demand for high-quality Mozzarella in Italy and the world has stimulated an increase in buffalo farming in Italy and improved animal management techniques. Mozzarella production is higher than all other cheeses and is forecast to increase still further.",

In Egypt, rayat is produced from natural acidi\u00aecation of raw milk, after the removal of cream, with no addition of bacteria, and zabadi is produced industrially. Raha is the fermented milk of Iraq, produced either from whole or skim milk, and laban or khather are the fermented milks of Syria, all of which are often produced from buffaloes' milk.",

In Italy, cream from buffalo milk is obtained after spinning; it is then pasteurized. After thermoacid coagulation (citric acid) of cream, another dairy product is obtained, called mascarpone. Quishada (made in Syria) is obtained from raw or boiled milk; sometimes, this cream is heated to make it more concentrated.",

A peculiarity of buffalo butter is the colour, which is much whiter than cows' milk butter, due to the lack of carotenoids. Ghee is obtained by boiling butter. It was very popular in Egypt and was found very useful in the baking industry. In Azerbaijan ghee is the only product obtained from buffalo milk. It is evident that the dairy products made from buffalo milk in the Mediterranean area need to be more deeply studied; the variability of their technologies is an important part of global biodiversity.",
