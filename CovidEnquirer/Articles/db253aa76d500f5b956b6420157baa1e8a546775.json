At that time, it was believed that yellow fever was spread on clothing of infected patients and from person-to-person contact. However, in 1900, a US Army physician, Major Walter Reed, discovered that mosquitoes were the carriers of the deadly fever. 5 Using epidemiological principles for controlling mosquitoes, Major Reed ensured that their breeding grounds were drained and screens were placed on houses.",

Colonel Gorgas was an expert in construction sanitation, an important skill because mosquitoes also carried malaria. 6 Dr Gorgas developed a program to (1) drain areas where mosquitoes were breeding, (2) add larvicide oil to kill mosquito larvae in swamps that could not be drained, (3) cut brush and grass near homes to 1 foot high, (4) distribute the medication quinine to workers, and (5) build screens onto all government buildings. 6 Building the Panama Canal was a huge and difficult construction project.

The potential exposures from the time of the initial presentations until diagnosis and alert are indicative of the danger associated with a bioterrorism event.

This experience has been rich in lessons learned, from both things that were done well and things that could have been done better. For instance, an incident in Somalia in the early 1990s illustrates the myriad of problems caregivers face in disaster management. The capital, Mogadishu, is a city of more than two million people, many of whom live without electricity or running water. Warring groups had destroyed the local agriculture, which led to mass starvation. When other countries responded by sending food to Somalia, local leaders intercepted the food to barter for weapons. This led to millions of displaced refugees, hundreds of thousands of casualties, as well as endemic disease resulting from malnutrition and lack of proper sanitation. In 1992, the United Nations began an operation to help the Somali people receive food; however, what began as a mission to bring food to starving Somali ended in military battle. During the fighting, military health care providers were routinely exposed to a multitude of contagious diseases including tuberculosis, chicken pox, and other illnesses that are contained in Western society.",

Responding to such an event would primarily center on providing a large facility or tent to house patients suspected of having avian flu.

The first action was to determine who could assist. Assistance was found from personnel in other units and from coalition forces. For example, the PM officer implemented a program to protect the military personnel assigned to the area by bringing together the infection prevention and control nurse, a PM technician from another US military unit, the Veterinarian Detachments, an Australian infectious disease physician, and a Romanian NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) decontamination unit. These actions were highly effective.
