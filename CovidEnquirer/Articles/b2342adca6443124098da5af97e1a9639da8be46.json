            "text": "Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an economically significant cause of calf scours and winter dysentery of adult cattle, and may induce respiratory tract infections in cattle of all ages. Early diagnosis of BCoV helps to diminish its burden on the dairy and beef industry. Real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of BCoV has been described, but it is relatively expensive, requires well-equipped laboratories and is not suitable for on-site screening. A novel assay, using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA), for the detection of BCoV is developed. The BCoV RT-RPA was rapid (10-20 min) and has an analytical sensitivity of 19 molecules. No cross-reactivity with other viruses causing bovine gastrointestinal and/or respiratory infections was observed. The assay performance on clinical samples was validated by testing 16 fecal and 14 nasal swab specimens and compared to real-time RT-PCR. Both assays provided comparable results. The RT-RPA assay was significantly more rapid than the real-time RT-PCR assay. The BCoV RT-RPA constitutes a suitable accurate, sensitive and rapid alternative to the common measures used for BCoV diagnosis. In addition, the use of a portable fluorescence reading device extends its application potential to use in the field and point-of-care diagnosis.",

The virus is also implicated in respiratory tract infections of growing calves and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle (Saif, 2010; Storz et al., 2000) . Some BCoV virus strains may also be responsible for simultaneous enteric and respiratory tract infections (Decaro et al., 2008a) . Although BCoV infections have a high morbidity that may reach 100%, it rarely causes death. However, the economic losses are substantial in dairy and beef farms due to sudden and dramatic reduction in milk production and loss of body weight (Svensson et al., 2003; Traven et al., 2001) .",

Samples collected from animals in the field are sent to the laboratory for testing as mobile real-time PCR is rarely available, complex technically and expensive. Therefore, a portable, simple, rapid nucleic acid detection test, and accurate as PCR is needed to detect the virus at the site where infections occur. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal DNA amplification and detection technology (Piepenburg et al., 2006) . In contrast to PCR, amplification depends on a specific combination of enzymes and proteins (recombinase, single strand binding protein, and strand displacing DNA polymerase) used at a constant temperature (Euler et al., 2012a,b) . Real-time detection of the amplification process is contingent on RPA exo probes and the fluorescence signal is measured in real-time via a simple point-of-care scanner weighing only 1.2 kg including a laptop computer (ESEQuant Tubescanner device, QiagenLake Constance GmbH, Stockach, Germany). In this report, the development of a real-time RT-RPA assay for rapid, simple and portable detection of BCoV in field samples was described.",

The BCoV RT-RPA was tested using the quantitative RNA standard in 8 replicates, the threshold time was plotted against molecules detected and a semi-log regression was calculated. For exact determination, a probit regression was performed using the Statistica software (StatSoft, Hamburg, Germany). To determine the relationship between real-time RT-PCR CT value and RT-RPA threshold time, a linear regression analysis using Prism software (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, California) was performed. The target sequence of GenBank accession number EU401981 was synthesized (Life Technologies/GeneArt AG, Regensburg, Germany) to check a sequence mismatch at position 11 of the upstream primer, which occurs in sequences GenBank accession number FJ938063, EU401980-82, and DQ811784. The assay specificity was evaluated against a panel of viruses considered for differential diagnosis with BCoV. The final assay performance was validated by testing RNA extracts of bovine clinical samples as compared to real-time RT-PCR results.",

As they maintain the higher sensitivity and specificity of real-time PCR, the use of isothermal amplification approaches in on-site screening could improve the diagnostic procedures for acute infections. Established isothermal amplification methods include transcription mediated amplification, nucleic acid sequence based amplification, strand displacement methods as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), rolling circle amplification methods, helicase dependent amplification, hybridization chain reaction and RPA (Chang et al., 2012; Gill and Ghaemi, 2008; Kim and Easley, 2011) . These methods differ in terms of complexity (number of enzymes, primers and/or probes), sensitivity, specificity, speed, contamination risk, portability, and commercial availability. Compared to other isothermal amplification techniques, RPA requires no initial heating for DNA denaturation and the target is amplified exponentially at a constant low temperature (37-42 \u2022 C). Together with the availability of assay reagents in a dry pellet form and the use of a battery-charged portable instrument (ESEQuant tubescanner), RPA may be the most applicable approach for field diagnosis of infectious diseases.",

The assay showed a distinct specificity, reproducibility and an analytical sensitivity of 10 3 copies of the DNA plasmid standard. In this study, an RT-RPA assay for the detection of BCoV was developed targeting the same gene. RNA standard was generated for better evaluation of the assay performance. While real-time RT-PCR assay maintained the same analytical sensitivity (10 3 copies) using the RNA standard, RT-RPA achieved an improved analytical sensitivity ( Fig. 1A and B ) of 19 molecules detected as determined by probit regression analysis (Fig. 1C) . The assay was shown to be reproducible throughout 8 test runs and linear over a range of 7 orders of magnitude, from 10 1 to 10 7 RNA copies (Fig. 1A) . The diagnostic applicability of the developed RT-RPA assay under field conditions was further validated by testing 30 bovine clinical samples as compared to real-time RT-PCR. The results of both assays were similar for all samples and the values of threshold time (in RT-RPA) and threshold cycles (in realtime RT-PCR) were highly compatible expect for only one sample (Fig. 2) .",
