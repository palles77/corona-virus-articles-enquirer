Unique among genetic RNA Viruses systems, their genome is RNA, which is transcribed, trans-I lated, and replicated quite differently from DNA; indeed, the RNA viruses themselves vary widely in the mechanisms whereby these processes are accomplished. Compared with most DNA viruses, all are extremely limited in the amount of genetic information they carry (see Table 7 -1), hence they code for relatively few enzymes, although all require at least one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Finally, most RNA viruses mature by budding from cytoplasmic membranes.",

It will be noted that the RNA extracted from a virus is infectious only if (a) the genome does not occur in pieces, and (b) there is no virion transcriptase. The latter is a reflection of the polarity of the viral RNA. A transcriptase is only necessary when the viral RNA is \"antimessage,\" so that a complementary mRNA must be transcribed. The reverse transcriptase of Leukovirus constitutes a special case.",

In other words, the 221 mRNA of picornaviruses is identical with vRNA (one may call it \"vmRNA\"), whereas the mRNA of rhabdoviruses is cRNA (or \"cmRNA\"). Hopefully, this terminology should lead to less confusion than either of the two alternatives that the reader may encounter in the literature: namely (a) the conventional practice of calling virion RNA \" + \" and its complement \"-,\" or (b) Baltimore's more recent idea of calling mRNA \" + \" and its complement \"-.\" Both ideas are logical, but the existence of two mutually contradictory schemes suggests that we should use neither; the terminology proposed describes unequivocally the nature of the RNA under discussion.

Extracellular uncoating occurred only at 37 \u00b0C and could be inhibited by alkaline pH (8.5) or hypertonic salt (40 mM MgCk), conditions that have previously been found to stabilize ME virions against heat inactivation, to increase phagocytosis (Dales, 1965a), and to increase the plating efficiency of isolated viral RNA (review, Pagano, 1970). Obviously, release of RNA into the surrounding medium is not in itself relevant to the establishment of successful infection in nature, but the disruption of the capsid which makes RNA release possible is probably the first step in uncoating of the virion.",

Recognition of the very large polypeptide corresponding to the whole poliovirus genome was not a simple matter because of its very short life. Jacobson and Baltimore (1968b) demonstrated its existence by allowing protein synthesis to proceed in the presence of amino acid analogs, or at a temperature of 43 \u00b0C, or in the presence of diisopropyl fluorophosphate to inhibit cleavage (reviews by Baltimore, 1971a; Baltimore et ah, 1971) .

Figure 7 -2 (Chapter 7) depicts the sequence of events. NCVP00 represents the \"polyprotein\" translated from the whole polioviral genome. While nascent on the ribosome it is cleaved in two places to yield NCVPl, NCVP2, and NCVPX (Jacobson and Baltimore, 1970) . There is good evidence from genetic maps constructed from recombination experiments using temperaturesensitive mutants that NCVP2 is (or includes) the viral polymerase I, and more tentative speculation that NCVPX may represent polymerase II, or perhaps a sigma factor conferring viral specificity on a host polymerase (Cooper, 1969; Cooper et al., 1971) . NCVPl clearly contains all the structural polypeptides of the viral capsid, for the second round of cleavage (which may sometimes occur before NCVP00 has been completed but is usually delayed for some minutes) converts it to VPO, VPl, and VP3, which comigrate in gel electrophoresis with the three structural proteins found in empty virions, and have almost identical tryptic peptide maps (Baltimore, 1971a). As will be discussed in detail below, the final cleavage of VPO to yield VP2 and VP4 does not occur until 20-30 minutes later, coinciding in time with the assembly of RNA and protein into mature virions.",

Recently, Rekosh et al. (1970) have shown by peptide mapping that poliovirus RNA is translated as efficiently as f2 RNA by E. coli ribosomes, but the resulting proteins are much smaller than NCVP00. Initiation occurs at several sites in this bacterial in vitro system, each of the resulting proteins beginning with N-formyl methionine. This being so, such systems lose much of their appeal as an approach to the study of translation of animal viral RNA's. Fortunately, however, satisfactory mammalian cell-free systems are now being developed. As first demonstrated some years ago, EMC viral RNA is translated efficiently in vitro by Krebs' ascites ribosomes from the mouse (see Kerr and Martin, 1971) . Ribosomes from rabbit reticulocytes were then shown to translate enteroviral RNA with fidelity to yield specific protein of high molecular weight (Mathews and K\u00f6rner, 1970) . Human HeLa cell ribosomes translate RNA from any of the cardioviruses almost as well as do ribosomes of murine origin (ascites or L cells) provided that certain soluble factors are supplied from mouse cells (Eggen and Shatkin, 1972) .",

In synopsis, vRNA (+) is the template for the synthesis of cRNA (-). Several cRNA molecules may be transcribed simultaneously by separate polymerase molecules; the whole structure is known as the \"replicative intermediate\" (RI) . Released cRNA molecules in turn serve as templates for the simultaneous transcription of several vRNA strands. Different polymerases may be required for the two stages in this cyclic process. A doublehelical form of viral RNA, known as the \"replicative form\" (RF), is an irrelevant end product or artifact. A schematic diagram of the replication of viral RNA is given in Fig. 6 -2.",

The polymerase molecule present at this growing end may play an important role in holding the strands together. The 5' end of each nascent strand quickly separates from the template and floats free as a single-stranded \"tail/' These tails can be artificially removed from the RI by ribonuclease I, leaving a partially doublestranded structure consisting of one intact strand hydrogen bonded to several shorter sequences, with gaps in between. Heating the RI produces a biphasic hyperchromic shift; the single-stranded branches are gradually denaturated at relatively low temperatures, then hydrogen bonds are melted abruptly when the T m of the double-stranded RF is reached. On analysis, most of the complete single-stranded templates are found to be cRNA (i.e., -, as indicated by their ability to hybridize with vRNA) while the short pieces of heterogenous lengths are found to be mainly.+. In other words, the synthesis of RNA is asymmetric, + strands being made at five to ten times the rate of -strands (Bishop and Levintow, 1971).",

It is easier to envisage that RNA is able to associate with capsomers to form a virion only after the \"immature protomers\" have assumed a particular tertiary configuration as a result of cleavage of VPO -> VP2 + VP4. \"Procapsids\" would then represent experimental artifacts or unstable byproducts of viral assembly.",

As a result of the diversion of mRNA from transcription to translation which occurs from 3.5 hours onward, there is a substantial pool of capsid protein but not of vRNA. Hence virions are assembled at an exponential rate from RNA synthesized 0-15 minutes earlier and protein made an average of 20 to 60 minutes earlier.

It was unexpected to find that polymerase I, which is presumably the first virus-coded protein required for the replication of the parental RNA molecule, is in fact synthesized last of all the viral proteins, being situated at the C terminal end of NCVPOO. However, there may be great advantage in the polymerase molecule being completed in close apposition to the 3' end of the vRNA because that is the end to which the polymerase must bind to initiate the first round of RNA replication. Until at least one complementary RNA molecule has been transcribed by this replicase the exponential phase of viral multiplication cannot begin. Indeed, there must be only a small probability that the enzyme can successfully complete its 1-minute journey from 3' terminus to 5' without encountering a ribosome progressing slowly (12 minutes) in the opposite direction. Failure to accomplish this mission before the template is degraded by RNase could lead to an abortive infection, and is perhaps one of several reasons for the low \"plating efficiency\" of viruses in mammalian cells (see Chapter 2). The chance delays encountered by the infecting vRNA molecule in transcribing the first molecule of cRNA, or indeed in managing to attach to a 45 S ribosomal subunit to translate the first polymerase molecule, may contribute substantially to the well known phenomenon of \"multiplicity-dependent delay\" (Cairns, 1957) .",

A striking proliferation of cytoplasmic vesicles (smooth membrane cisternae) is clearly visible by electron microscopy between 3 and 7 hours after infection (Amako and Dales, 1967; Mosser et ah, 1972) . By rate zonal and equilibrium gradient centrifiguration, it is possible to separate the sites of viral RNA replication from those of protein synthesis (Caliguiri and Tamm, 1970) . RNA is synthesized in a \"replication complex\" (Penman et ah, 1964; Girard et al., 1967) consisting of RI with about one-half dozen molecules of attached polymerase in association with smooth membrane. Viral proteins, on the other hand, are assembled mainly but not exclusively on membrane-bound polyribosomes, which can be clearly separated from RI and polymerase. It seems, therefore, that ribosomes do not attach to the 5' end of nascent mRNA while it is still being transcribed from a cRNA molecule, as happens in certain bacteria. Nevertheless, the fact that RNA engaged in transcription or translation must be attached to a membrane ensures that ribosomal subunits will find themselves in close apposition to mRNA molecules as the latter detach from the RI. In-fact, Huang and Baltimore (1970a) have calculated that the average newly synthesized mRNA molecule has thirty-five ribosomes attached to it in little more than 10 minutes, i.e., the minimum time required for one ribosome to travel the length of the message. Similarly, localization of these processes to a restricted area on the surface of a membrane may enable capsid proteins to accumulate in sufficient concentration to stand a good chance of encountering a vRNA molecule and assembling automatically into a virion.",

These specific effects which begin quite early in the viral multiplication cycle are not to be confused with the later decline of cellular and viral macromolecular synthesis that eventually accompanies the death of the cell in any cytocidal infection. Virus-induced cell \"shutdown\" (\"shutoff,\" \"cutoff\") has been recognized for many years (Martin et al., 1961; Franklin and Baltimore, 1962; Zimmerman et al., 1963) but there is still uncertainty about the precise mechanisms involved (reviews, Darnell et al., 1967; Martin and Kerr, 1968) . Direct comparison of results obtained in different systems is difficult because the speed and extent of the shutdown depends critically on the multiplicity of infection and the medium (\"growth\" or \"maintenance\") as well as on the strain of virus and cell involved. Early data that cellular protein synthesis declines at least as rapidly as cellular RNA, despite the fact that mammalian mRNA has a half-life of several hours, pointed to separate effects of viral infection on translation and transcription, respectively. The decline in cellular DNA synthesis is thought to be a secondary consequence of inhibition of host protein synthesis. Most of the available evidence suggests that newly synthesized virus-coded protein(s) are responsible for the shutdown of all these cellular macromolecules (Franklin and Baltimore, 1962; Penman and Summers, 1965) , although it is puzzling that interferon has no effect on the phenomenon (Martin and Kerr, 1968).",

Concomitantly with the rise in virus-coded protein synthesis, polyribosomes reappear, but now they are uniformly large (20-40 ribosomes, average 35) because vRNA, with a molecular weight of 2.6 million daltons, has supplanted cellular mRNA of heterogeneous but generally lower molecular weight (Penman et al., 1963; Dales et al, 1965a) . By the time substantial amounts of new viral protein become detectable the rate of cellular protein synthesis has dropped to 25 to 50% of normal, and it continues to fall further throughout the remainder of the cycle (Franklin and Baltimore, 1962). Experiments with cycloheximide indicate that a newly synthesized virus-coded protein is responsible for the shutdown (Baltimore and Franklin, 1963; Penman and Summers, 1965) ; it acts by preventing the attachment of cellular mRNA to ribosomes (Leibowitz and Penman, 1971) . If viral RNA replication is prevented by guanidine or by infection with virus inactivated by ultraviolet irradiation or hydroxylamine, shutdown of host protein synthesis is negligible at low multiplicity of infection but still occurs at high multiplicity, presumably because a certain amount of the repressor protein is synthesized, albeit at a very slow rate, off parental vRNA templates (Penman and Summers, 1965) . Cooper et al. (1973) postulate that the repressor is the \"equestron,\" namely, the viral capsid protein precursor NCVPl, at the stage when it has been cleaved to VPO, 1, and 3 but before its final cleavage to VPl, 2, 3, and 4. Ehrenfeld and Hunt (1971) have demonstrated that double-stranded RNA (RF) inhibits polioviral protein synthesis when added to an in vitro system of rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes. This phenomenon is not specific because synthetic polynucleotides as well as double-stranded RNA from Q\u00df and reovirus are also somewhat inhibitory.",

Cole et al., 1971) . These particles interfere with the multiplication of infectious virus but are only capable of reproduction themselves when complemented by infectious virions. In the absence of the \"helper,\" they are competent to make viral proteins and defective viral RNA but no infectious virions.

More recently Simmons and Strauss (1972b) have described two species of RI, one producing complete vRNA molecules, the other producing shorter molecules of the same polarity. Treatment with RNase yielded three species of RF, corresponding in length to one-third, two-thirds, and 100% of the viral genome. Stollar et al. (1972) have isolated even shorter (12 S and 15 S) double-stranded RNA species late in the cycle from Sindbis virus-infected mammalian or avian (but not mosquito) cells. Sreevalsan (1970a) found that most of the RI, RF, and viral polymerase in Sindbis virus-infected cells was bound to cytoplasmic membranes. Parental vRNA from radioactively labeled virions also rapidly attached to membranes, leading Sreevalsan to the conclusion that intimate association with membranes is essential for viral RNA replication.",

The first step in assembly is the association of vRNA with protein to form the nucleocapsid (Friedman, 1968) . Nucleocapsids then migrate to the plasma membrane and budding occurs at a relatively constant rate of 200-1000 pfu per hour from those regions of the membrane into which viral peplomers have been inserted (Acheson and Tamm, 1967) . Relatively few virions form by budding into cytoplasmic vacuoles; aggregation of excess nucleocapsids around such vesicles and into paracrystalline arrays (Morgan et ah, 1961) occurs only very late in the cycle when the release of virions into the supernatant fluid is almost complete (Acheson and Tamm, 1967) . The extensive proliferation of cytoplasmic vacuoles that is also seen in thin sections may be connected with some necessary role for membranes in viral RNA replication and protein synthesis rather than with the budding process, because the phenomenon is equally conspicuous in poliovirus-infected cells.",

The independent establishment of continuous lines of mosquito cells by Grace, Singh and Peleg presents virologists with the opportunity to compare the growth of togaviruses in invertebrate and vertebrate cells (reviewed by Weiss, 1971; Dalgarno and Kelly, 1973) . Reh\u00e2\u00e7ek et al (1971) and Buckley (1971) have shown that several flaviviruses and some alphaviruses grow well in mosquito cell lines. There are usually no cytopathic effects, although some flaviviruses lyse a few cells or cause others to fuse together, but the culture eventually recovers. Persistent infections usually develop with only a small proportion of the cells producing virus. SFV grows with essentially the same kinetics (latent period, rate of viral production, final yield) in cultured cells of the mosquito Aedes albopictus at 28\u00b0 or 37\u00b0C as it does in vertebrate cells (Vero) at 37\u00b0C (Dalgarno and Kelly, 1973) .",

The genome occurs as 7 or more separate RNA molecules, each corresponding to a single cistron. A transcriptase associated with the ribonucleoprotein transcribes cRNA molecules which serve as messengers for translation into the seven known viral proteins. Mixed infection commonly leads to reassortment of the separate influenza genes giving rise to hybrid particles (see Chapter 7). Repeated passage of a single strain of virus at high multiplicity leads to the production of noninfectious particles lacking the largest of the genes (\"incomplete virus\" and the von Magnus phenomenon, discussed below). The multiplication of influenza virus is inhibited by actinomycin D, a-amanitine, enucleation of the host cell, or preirradiation of the cell with ultraviolet light; the meaning of these observations is uncertain, but one interpretation is that transcription of some cellular DNA is essential for viral replication.",

Following his discovery of hemagglutination in 1941, Hirst demonstrated that cells infectible by influenza virus also carried a receptor for the viral hemagglutinin and could be rendered resistant to infection by destroying those receptors with neuraminidase. Body fluids including respiratory mucus and serum were found to contain an inhibitor of hemagglutination and of infectivity, which competed with cellular receptors for virus but, like the cell receptors, could be destroyed by viral or bacterial neuraminidase. Gottschalk (review, Gottschalk et al, 1972) identified the cellular receptors and the soluble inhibitors as glycoproteins with N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) as the terminal sugar in the carbohydrate sidechains and demonstrated the removal of neuraminic acid with neuraminidase (sialidase).",

Morgan and Rose (1968) demonstrated that fusion occurs very rapidly at 37\u00b0C (within about 5 minutes of adsorption at 4\u00b0C); they agree that phagocytosis (viropexis) does occur but believe that the phagocytosed virions are mostly destroyed by lysosomal enzymes.

An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with the same properties (production of short lengths of cRNA in vitro, requirement for Mg 2 + and stimulation by Mn 2 + , actinomycin-insensitivity) is synthesized in influenza-infected cells (Ho and Walters, 1966; Scholtissek, 1969) . The concentration of this transcriptase builds up slowly from 1 hour after infection to reach a peak in the cytoplasm late in the cycle (Scholtissek and Rott, 1970) . The cRNA almost certainly represents mRNA since it is found in association with polyribosomes (Pons, 1972) .

Indeed, HA is always associated with membranes, being synthesized on membrane-associated ribosomes and moving within minutes through the smooth endoplasmic reticulum into plasma membrane (Compans, 1973; Stanley et al., 1973) . Using various inhibitory sugars which have been shown to block the completion of viral glycoproteins without affecting the synthesis of other viral proteins (Gandhi et al., 1972) , it has been shown that glucosamine is added to the HA almost immediately the polypeptide is synthesized and fucose is added shortly after (Stanley et al., 1973) .",

On the other hand, it is still possible that the natural state of RNP in infected cells and virions is a single continuous strand incorporating a complete set of RNA molecules and that the RNP fragments described are the result of breakage at weak points between the individual RNA's (Pons, 1970) .",

No doubt the enzyme is responsible for the absence of neuraminic acid in the glycoproteins and glycolipids of such areas of membrane (Klenk et al., 1970b ). Yet it seems improbable that neuraminidase plays a vital role in the insertion of glycoproteins into membranes, peplomer formation or budding itself, because many budding viruses lack the enzyme altogether. However, neuraminidase may play a role in expediting the elution of budded virions from the outside of the cell (Comp\u00e0ns et ah, 1970a) because anti-neuraminidase IgG (but not the monovalent Fab fragments obtained by pepsin digestion) inhibits the release of virus (Becht et al., 1971) . Anti-hemagglutinin has no effect, but concanavalin A, which appears to bind more strongly to neuraminidase than to hemagglutinin, does block viral production (Rott et al, 1972) .",

In influenza virus infection, the nucleoli are also grossly distorted (Compans and Dimmock, 1969), a nonstructural antigen is serologically demonstrable there (Dimmock, 1969) , and the main nonstructural protein, NS, rapidly accumulates there from the second hour of infection onward (Taylor et ah, 1970; Lazarowitz et ah, 1971 ).",

Choppin and Pons (1970) consider that the various virus-cell systems can be arranged in a sequence of decreasing productivity; at the top end would be highly productive systems such as any viral strain in MDBK cells, where the progeny are fully infectious even at high multiplicity for the first 1-2 passages; in the middle would be the classic von Magnus situation, applicable to most virus-cell combinations, where DI particle production increases only with repeated passage at high multiplicity; at the bottom end of the scale are \"nonpermissive\" cell lines, such as HeLa, in which the cycle is abortive (nonproductive) even at low multiplicty.",

It appears, therefore, that paramyxovirus mRNA consists of cRNA molecules which are shorter than the vRNA template (50-57 S) from which they are transcribed. Following transcription, polyadenylie acid totaling 4 S is covalently attached to 18 S cRNA (Pridgen and Kingsbury, 1972). Transcription of Sendai virus cRNA from parental vRNA templates occurs even in the presence of cycloheximide (Robinson, 1971b) presumably because the viral transcriptase is carried into the cell as an integral constituent of the nucleocapsid (Huang et al., 1971; Robinson, 1971a; Stone et al., 1971) . Later in the cycle, cycloheximide again has no effect on the synthesis of cRNA, which is still the dominant RNA species being made, but the synthesis of vRNA (57 S) declines rapidly (Robinson, 1971b).",

Two types of virus-induced fusion can be distinguished: \"fusion from without\" and \"fusion from within\" (Bratt and Gallaher, 1970; see also Chapter 9). Fusion from without probably results from the fusion of the viral envelope to the plasma membranes of adjacent cells so causing them to flow together. It has been postulated to be due to the hemolysin since both activities are destroyed under conditions that fail to destroy the hemagglutinating activity or infectivity of the virion (Barbanti-Brodano et al., et al., 1967) , and occurs very rapidly (1-3 hours or less) at high multiplicity.",

The mechanism may be similar to that of fusion from without, namely fusion of the envelope of newly synthesized, extracellular or budding virus to the plasma membrane of an adjacent cell, or fusion of a virus-specific area of the plasma membrane of a cell to that of an adjacent cell.

Some of these mutants yield predominantly DI-T particles on undiluted passage at the permissive temperature. Autointerference by DI-T particles is more readily demonstrable in certain cell types than in others (Perrault and Holland, 1972b). (Stampfer et ah, 1969) . Clearly, transcription of T RNA is not required in order that interference occur. This conclusion is indirectly supported by the observation that, although DI-T particles from any of Pringle's ts mutants will interfere with the multiplication of wild-type B particles, none of them are able to complement ts B mutants from other complementation groups (Reichmann et ah, 1971) . Furthermore, Sreevalsan (1970b) has produced interference with purified RNA from T particles. The current hypothesis, therefore, is that T RNA specifically interferes with B RNA replication (but not transcription) by binding the VSV replicase with high affinity (Stampfer et ah, 1969; Sreevalsan, 1970b ).",

The leukoviruses are the only viruses known to change morphologically after leaving the cell.

After superinfection of chick cells (which already carry an integrated viral genome) with avian leukoviruses one of two results follows: with the nontransforming avian leukosis viruses, virions are released but the cells are essentially unchanged, whereas with the sarcoma viruses the cells are morphologically transformed and multiply with less restraint than normal cells (see Chapter 14).",

Nichols et ah (1972b) have determined the twenty-five nucleotides from the 5' end of mRNA of the s class and found that the first nine, (p)ppGCCAUUUUU, correspond with the sequence known to occur in the untranslated region at the 5' ends and the intercistronic regions of certain RNA phages. They postulate that it represents the ribosome attachment site, the polymerase recognition site, or the binding site for a linker. The initiation codon was not present in the first twenty-five residues, hence, must be even further in. Levin et ah (1972) have presented evidence for the existence of an AUG initiator codon somewhere in reovirus mRNA of all three size classes; Met-tRNAF, the usual initiator of protein synthesis in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, was found to form a complex with reoviral mRNA at a puromycin reactive site on mouse fibroblast L-929 ribosomes in vitro. Nichols et al. (1972a) propose that the 3000 or so oligonucleotides found in the average reovirion may be the product of abortive transcription. The 5'-Gterminated oligonucleotides resemble the sequence at the 5' end of reovirus mRNA; the authors postulate that for the short time during which the sub viral particle is acquiring its outer capsid as the final step in the assembly process, the transcriptase may continue to initiate successfully but be physically constrained from completing transcription; they calculate that the entire oligoucleotide complement of the virion could be transcribed in less than 3 minutes. The other major species of oligonucleotide in the reovirion, polyadenylate (Bellamy and Joklik, 1967; Shatkin and Sipe, 1968a) , could arise by reiterative copying of the short sequences of U known to occur near the 5' terminus of reovirus s mRNA (Nichols et ah, 1972a, b) .",

The inclusions are seen by electron microscopy to contain crystalline aggregates (and single particles) of virions, empty virions, and subviral particles within a matrix of fine filaments (Plate 6-3). Virions are released from the cell either singly or in such aggregates, over several hours, without budding. Subviral particles are intermediates in the assembly of virions. Astell et ah (1972) have constructed virions (as identified by electron microscopy and buoyant density) by mixing subviral particles with soluble proteins from infected cells. The main outer capsid protein, \u03c3 3/ together with small amounts of \u03bc and \u03c3\u03b9, were specifically the proteins selected from the pool. Transcriptase activity ceased with the attachment of \u03c3 3 and could be activated again by removal of the same protein with chymotrypsin.

There was a tendency for the number of molecules of each species transcribed to be inversely proportional to its molecular weight, mRNA of the I class being particularly scarce and s relatively plentiful, but there were several exceptions; e.g., si and s2 were transcribed only one-half as often as s3 and s4. Translation seemed to be independently controlled; five viral proteins were synthesized in abundance and others, notably \u03c3\u03b9, in very small amounts.

            "text": "is then translated into protein. As with picornaviruses, togavirus proteins are synthesized on membrane-bound cytoplasmic polyribosomes (Friedman, 1968). The structural viral proteins are detectable in infected cells 1.5 hours after infection (Wecker andSchonne, 1961); actinomycin pretreatment may be used to reduce the background of cell protein synthesis. Strauss et al. (1969) described up to a dozen additional electrophoretic peaks in Sindbis virus-infected cells which they believed may represent nonstructural virus-coded proteins or high molecular weight precursors. Evidence for cleavage was obtained by Burrell et al. (1970) using short pulse labels in an SFV-BHK21 system. Scheele and Pfefferkorn (1970) were not able to demonstrate posttranslational cleavage using pulsechase experiments in this system, but described a ts mutant that produced large amounts of a high molecular weight protein instead of nucleocapsid protein at the nonpermissive temperature. More recently, Pfefferkorn and Boyle (1972a) reported that a high molecular weight protein accumulated in Sindbis virus-infected cells in the presence of an inhibitor of chymotrypsin, while Sefton and S. Schlesinger (unpublished) have data showing that a precursor of MW 130,000 is rapidly cleaved to yield the core protein and a 100,000 MW intermediate, which represents the precursor of the two envelope glycoproteins. B\u00fcrge and his colleagues have addressed themselves to the problem of how viral glycoproteins are synthesized. Most of their analyses were conducted before they discovered that there are two (not one) species of envelope glycoprotein in Sindbis virus (Schlesinger et al., 1972), but many of their earlier conclusions are still valid. Virtually all the radioactive sugar label incorporated into acid-precipitable material between 3 and 11 hours after infection in Sindbis virus-infected cells was in viral glycoprotein in cytoplasmic membranes (B\u00fcrge and Strauss, 1970). The glycopeptides extractable from these glycoproteins were, except for the number of terminal sialic acid residues, indistinguishable by exclusion chromatography from those extracted from vesicular stomatitis viral glycoproteins grown in the same cell line (B\u00fcrge and Huang, 1970). Since separate transferases are required toadd each individual sugar it is unlikely that togaviruses (or any other budding viruses) carry enough genes to code for them all. Evidence that the enzymes involved are cellular comes from the demonstration that sialyltransferase and fucosyltransferase are not altered in their specific activity or acceptor specificity as a result of Sindbis virus infection; moreover, sialyltransferase from uninfected cells was shown to be capable of transferring [ 3 H] sialic acid to Sindbis virus glycoprotein (Grimes and B\u00fcrge, 1971). David (1971) presented evidence to support the view that the composition of the hydrophobic end of the viral glycoprotein peplomers determines the selection of host lipids for the viral envelope, since the lipid composition of viruses varies with the virus as well as the host cell from which the virus buds (Renkonen et al., 1971; see Chapter 3).Replication and Transcription of Viral RNAThe fact that togavirus RNA is infectious (Wecker and Schonne, 1961) is powerful evidence that the genome is a single molecule of mRNA, but this has never been formally proved by a demonstration that vRNA can serve as a tern-plate for in vitro synthesis of viral protein. Such an experiment, or even a description of the mRNA isolated from polyribosomes, would help to clarify the mystery that surrounds the role of the 26 S \"interjacent RNA\" (Sonnabend et al., 1967), which is consistently found in infected cells in addition to vRNA (42-49 S), RF (16-23 S) and RI (polydisperse, 22-30 S) (Stern and Friedman, 1969; Cartwright and Burke, 1970; Sreevalsan, 1970a; Simmons and Strauss, 1972a, b). Because interjacent RNA is single-stranded, RNase-sensitive, and of the same polarity as vRNA but shares only one-third of its base sequences, Simmons and Strauss (1972a, b) postulate that this 26 S molecule and the 33-38 S species described by Levin and Friedman (1971) represent mRNA molecules corresponding to an incomplete segment of the vRNA. Any proteins translated from such large messengers would presumably need to be cleaved. By contrast, Eaton et al. (1972) have isolated from polysomes of alphavirusinfected cells a heterogeneous population of 16-18 S RNA's which contain a 4 S RNase-resistant A-rich region, but this has not been positively identified as mRNA either.",

All workers recognize the five major structural proteins known as L, G, M, N and NS (see Chapter 3), but it is unclear whether any of the minor peaks described by Mudd and Summers (1970a) correspond with the two additional minor structural proteins A and B, recently detected, together with L and NS, in RNP from the virion (Bishop and Roy, 1972). Kang and Prevec (1971) were not able to detect any nonstructural proteins even when the background of host protein synthesis was reduced by prolonged pretreatment with actinomycin D. There is no evidence of posttranslational cleavage (Mudd and Summers, 1970a; Wagner et al., 1970), a finding not unexpected in the light of the evidence that the small cRNA molecules in polysomes are probably monocistronic messengers.",
