Now, demand that this is an entire class of solvents that can be customized to specific needs and delivered in kiloton quantities. What do you have? Ionic liquids -called ''ILs'' meet these requirements. One example is methylimidazolium chloride. This is an IL with a melting point of 75 8C. The IL is used in a purification process by BASF for scavenging acid from a diethoxyphenylphosphine production line. The IL is recycled by treating it with caustic, and regenerating methylimidazole.",

In the chemical engineering laboratories you will find lab-scale activity that is then scaled-up to pilot plant levels. Some of these studies will prove sufficiently valuable to put into full production. Each of these steps have the potential for EH&S-related problems. At all levels, the undefined toxicological properties could result in over-exposures, even with strict engineering controls in place. The lack of physical property data -a heat of reaction -for example, could contribute to a run-away reaction during scale-up. Releases to the environment could have unforeseen consequences.",

Once inside the cell, Triclosan poisons a specific enzyme that many bacteria and funguses need for survival. Triclosan blocks the active site of an enzyme called enoyl-acyl carrier-protein reductase (ENR for short), preventing the bacteria from manufacturing fatty acids it needs for building cell membranes and other vital functions. Humans don't have this enzyme, so Triclosan does not pose a metabolic hazard to them. One molecule of Triclosan permanently disables an ENR molecule, which explains why Triclosan has powerful antibiotic action even at very low concentrations. Triclocarban's structural similiarity suggests a similiar mode of action.",

I trust that the author and publisher will appreciate the advertising. Note that Ms. Northcutt claims to have verified each story. Ms. Northcutt studied molecular biology at UC Berkeley, worked in a neuroscience research laboratory at Stanford, and later joined a biotech startup developing cancer and diabetes therapeutics.
