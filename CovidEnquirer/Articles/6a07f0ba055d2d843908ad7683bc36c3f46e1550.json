However, the data sources used were of higher quality in economic evaluations conducted after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Vaccination and drug regimens were varied. Pharmaceutical plus non-pharmaceutical interventions are relatively cost effective in comparison to vaccines and/or antivirals alone. Pharmaceutical interventions vary from cost saving to high cost effectiveness ratios. According to ceiling thresholds (Gross National Income per capita), the reduction of nonessential contacts and the use of pharmaceutical prophylaxis plus the closure of schools are amongst the cost effective strategies for all countries. However, quarantine for household contacts is not cost effective even for low and middle income countries.",

            "text": "When a new subtype of influenza A virus which is infectious to humans gains human-to-human transmissibility efficiently enough to cause community level outbreaks, this virus is said to have pandemic potential. If this new subtype spreads globally causing disease and deaths, it becomes pandemic. Since the 16th century, influenza pandemics have occurred at intervals ranging between 10-50 years, creating varying levels of impact on societies. [1] In March 2009, a new subtype of influenza A H1N1 virus was identified in Mexico and the United States. It spread to all continents in less than nine weeks becoming the first pandemic of the 21st century. Children, young adults, pregnant women, and those with chronic illnesses were disproportionately affected and constituted the majority of the hospitalization cases. The estimated case fatality rate was 0.15-0.25%, with most deaths in middleaged adults with underlying diseases. [2] Although concrete evidence on the macroeconomic consequences of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have not yet been revealed, previous studies estimated the potential reduction of labor productivity and consumption demand, with results showing an approximately 2-5% decrease in annual gross product. [3, 4] The World Health Organization (WHO) published pandemic preparedness and response guidance in 1999 with two revisions: the first in 2005 and the second in 2009. [1, 2] These documents summarize the recommended WHO and national actions against pandemic influenza according to recognized pandemic phases. For some recommendations, evidence is limited to observations or epidemiological models. In some cases, inferences are drawn from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as seasonal influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome. With a view to incorporating important experience and evidence acquired during the H1N1 2009 pandemic, the WHO will revise its pandemic preparedness guidelines. Including cost effectiveness evidence in the revision process will strengthen the guidance by providing a framework to prioritize the allocation of limited resources in impending, high risk times.",

Second, studies were assessed according to the quality of evidence used, since it is widely recognized that the credibility of economic evaluations depends not only on the appropriateness of the methods employed but also on the input evidence. Several types of evidence are evaluated according to their level of quality: i) clinical effect sizes; ii) adverse events and complications; iii) baseline clinical data; iv) resource use; v) costs; and vi) utilities (only applicable to cost utility analyses). The data sources of each component are ranked from one to six in descending order. Rank 1 is given if parameters are derived from the most appropriate data sources.

This study converted cost effectiveness ratios into a common currency and utility unit. Costs in international dollars (I$), at 2011 values, were calculated using national gross domestic product deflator values and implied purchasing power parity conversion rates from the International Monetary Fund (http://www.imf. org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id = 28). In addition, exchange rates obtained from the OANDA website (http://www.oanda.com/ currency/historical-rates) were applied when cost outcomes were reported in foreign currencies rather than in local equivalents. Because of the lack of explicit and implicit thresholds for most countries to determine which interventions are cost effective, the World Bank thresholds for classifying countries into low income, lower middle income, upper middle income, and high income countries according to 2010 Gross National Income (GNI) per capita were used as maximum ceiling thresholds. [8] In other words, the interventions that spent fewer resources than the upper bound of GNI per capita given by the World Bank in order to gain one QALY or save one DALY represent good value for money.",

Table 4 compares the quality of evidence used for economic evaluations conducted before and after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. It illustrates the poor quality of data used for baseline clinical data, estimating adverse events and complications of interventions, resource use, and utilities for the studies conducted before 2009. More than half of this information was from non-analytic studies (e.g., case reports or case series), expert opinions, and unsourced information. A significant improvement was observed for economic evaluations conducted after the 2009 event. For these studies, a majority of baseline clinical data was obtained from case series or the analyses of reliable administrative databases from the setting of interest. Almost half of these studies employed resource use information from reliable administrative data sets from the setting of interest and also over half of the utilities were derived from direct or indirect utility assessment rather than from unknown sources or expert opinion. Nevertheless, there was not much difference in the quality of clinical effect size parameters between the before and after studies. This may be explained by the fact that the most appropriate clinical effect size source is the randomized controlled trial and a pandemic event is unrelated to the availability of this type of study. Figure 3 compares the cost per QALY of each intervention as well as before and after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Evidence suggests that providing interventions either to the general population or only to target groups does not yield a significant influence on ICERs.",

For pharmaceutical interventions, ICERs can vary largely, from cost saving to very high values (.I$ 1,000,000 per QALY). According to the predefined ceiling thresholds, 'social distancing' (a strategy in which non-school, non-work and non-household personal contacts are reduced [40] ), antiviral prophylaxis for the general population plus the closure of schools, vaccination for the general population plus the closure of schools, and antiviral prophylaxis for household contacts plus the closure of schools are amongst the cost effective strategies for all low, middle and high income countries because their ICERs are well below the maximum ceiling threshold for low income countries (lowest dot line). (Of course, the interventions that are cost effective for low income countries should also be cost effective for countries with higher incomes). Quarantine for household contacts seems unlikely to be cost effective even for low and middle income countries because the ICER is well above the maximum ceiling threshold for upper middle income countries. (However, this interpretation cannot apply to high income countries because it depends on their GNI per capita). Disappointingly, our findings suggest that most economic evaluations conducted after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic focus on different interventions compared to studies carried out before the 2009 event. In a few studies that cover the same interventions, the results do not differ considerably.",

Consideration of contact patterns is especially important in modeling non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. social distancing), because the effectiveness of these interventions is highly dependent on how the population interacts or behaves in the initial phase of the pandemic. [35] It is noteworthy that a number of reviewed papers do not provide detailed information about Table 2 . Classification of studies by types of interventions, modified from the WHO and World Bank's taxonomy [52, 53] . contact patterns and relevant assumptions, but instead they refer to other epidemiological studies. In this regard, we reviewed the relevant sources and found that the quality of evidence used ranges from assumption [51] to data from a large study conducted in the European Union. [9, 12, 39, 48, 49] Only one study conducted after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic appears to employ real data in areas affected by the pandemic to construct a social network. [24] In general, all epidemic models have an underlying network of mixing patterns, even though this network may not be explicit. Some compartmental models included in this review do not allow for variability (i.e., assuming that communities are homogenous or not taking account of variability derived from age, sex, behavior, and social and spatial structure) [10, 22, 25, 26, 51] , although some include modifications that allow for some level of heterogeneity, such as age specific mixing patterns. [9, 12, 35, 36, 39, [48] [49] [50] On the other hand, almost half of the studies included are agent based models, which appear to reflect the heterogeneity in contact patterns as occurs in the real world, especially those with a social network design [11, 15, 16, 21, 24, 40, [43] [44] [45] [46] (Table S7 ).",

This picture does not change when comparing between studies conducted before and after the pandemic. The majority of studies (34/44, 77%) focused only on pharmaceutical interventions such as using vaccines and antiviral drugs. This may be explained by the nature of non-pharmaceutical interventions, for which effectiveness and cost effectiveness are difficult to assess. For instance, it may be unethical to restrict travel or to introduce public communication and advisory measures for only specific population groups. There is a lack of standard protocols for non-pharmaceutical interventions resulting in a large variability of practice across settings. Also, most of the nonpharmaceutical interventions are complex, involving multidimensional aspects and difficulties to control confounding factors. Lastly, in the absence of a pandemic event, it is difficult to introduce radical public measures (e.g., travel restrictions, school closure, and quarantine), which hinder opportunities to generate robust and reliable evidence on effectiveness.",

This may be because these studies were conducted in settings where health economics was well established.

To improve the comparability of future evaluations, it is important to introduce internationally accepted methodological guidelines. Although a WHO guide for standardisation of economic evaluations of immunization programmes [54] is publicly available, it is applicable only to vaccination, but not to antiviral drugs and nonpharmaceutical interventions.",

This is useful not only for decision makers in each country, but also for intergovernmental organizations which guide and support countries to allocate resources such as the WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the World Bank. However, interpreting the results of Figure 3 needs to be done with caution. This synthesis is dominated by only three studies, although data from 16 out of 44 studies were used. This is because the authors of these papers [29, 40, 46] assessed a wide range of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions and met the eligibility criterion to be included in the figure (i.e., presenting results in terms of incremental cost utility ratios) (Table S8) . Apart from the recognized challenges of conducting systematic reviews of economic evaluations, [55] we synthesized all studies presenting cost utility ratios (shown in Figure 3 ) due to the paucity of data, regardless of the quality of the evidence and methodology used. However, this should not significantly affect our results, since the overall quality of both input evidence and economic evaluation methods is similar across the studies. In addition, despite our effort to provide information on cost effective interventions for developing countries by using the World Bank's thresholds, the transferability of cost outcomes across jurisdictions remains a controversial issue. [56] In comparison to the work of Lugn\u00e9r and Postma, [57] who reviewed economic evaluations of influenza pandemic interventions from MEDLINE as their sole source, our review is more comprehensive. Lugn\u00e9r and Postma only provided descriptive results of the review and methodological recommendations for future economic evaluations. [57] Whilst our review does not focus on examining methodological approaches but aims to offer policy recommendations, it does not fully succeed due to the limitations of the reviewed studies. These include the paucity of effectiveness and cost effectiveness studies on non-pharmaceutical interventions, and the limited number of studies assessing value for money across interventions.",
