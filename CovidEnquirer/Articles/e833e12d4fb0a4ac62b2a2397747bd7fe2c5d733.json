            "text": "Many asthma exacerbations are caused by respiratory viral infections that induce the interplay between Th1 and Th2 immune responses. However, the time trends for Th1 and Th2 immune responses during these phenomena have not been well studied. Objective: To identify possible mechanisms underlying the link between respiratory viral infections and asthma exacerbations. Patients and methods: We recruited 40 adults aged 21-58 years for 4 groups. A. Healthy, B. Healthy with viral infection, C. Mild to moderate asthma and D. Same as C, but with viral infection. Th1 and Th2 cytokines in induced sputum samples during the course of acute upper respiratory viral infections in otherwise healthy and asthmatic individuals were monitored. IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-\u03b3 were assayed by ELISA. Viral infection symptoms and asthma severity scores were monitored. Time trends were analyzed using linear mixed models. Results: IL-4 and IL-5 levels in groups C and D were higher than in groups A and B. IFN-\u03b3 levels and viral infection symptoms scores in group B spiked by day 2 and rapidly declined by day 7, while in group D, IFN-\u03b3 and symptoms scores for viral infection and asthma peaked much later (days [3] [4] [5] and slowly declined. The ratios of IL-4 and IL-5 to IFN-\u03b3 in group D were significantly higher than in group C. Conclusions: Infection-induced asthma exacerbations may be due to impaired anti-viral Th1-immune responses. There appears to be a critical window of 3-5 days for therapeutic intervention.",

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) has reported that, worldwide, 300 million individuals suffer from asthma. 1 This load is aggravated by the fact that many asthmatic patients can suffer exacerbations of their symptoms due to external causes not related to their underlying disease. Prospective studies have shown that 85% of these exacerbations in children and about half in adults are due to viral infections. 2, 3 According to our clinical observations, frequently asthma exacerbations take place 3-5 days after an individual contracts a viral infection of the upper airways. 4 Currently, studies that aim to determine the possible mechanism of the causal relationship between viral infections and asthma exacerbations have been focused on the interaction between immune responses Th1 and Th2.",

            "text": "These 2 groups of helper T lymphocytes are differentiated by the cytokines they release: the Th1 cells predominantly produce gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3), while the Th2 cells produce interleukin (IL) 4 and IL-5. In healthy individuals homeostasis between Th1 and Th2 is very important. A change in the Th population with Th cells replaced by Th1 cells tends to decrease the production of Th2 cells, whereas an increase of Th2 cells suppresses the production of the Th1 cells. During a viral airway infection (predominance of Th1 type) the immune responses can modulate the deviation of the immune system towards a Th2 response, present in asthma, and, in fact, the immune status established in asthma may alter the course of antiviral responses. It was considered that inhibition of production of IL-4 and IL-5 should be effective for asthma treatment. Furthermore, although using this strategy eosinophilia was suppressed, it has not been shown to be useful from the clinical point of view. [5] [6] [7] The lack of efficacy of IL-12 or IFN-\u03b3 administration, which suppresses Th2 activity, has also been reported. 8 One of the problems to determine optimum treatment modalities is that time trends of Th1 and Th2 immune responses have not been studied in detail during acute viral infections. Among the various non-invasive methods to assess airway inflammation, induced sputum examination is a relatively simple strategy. Freezing an induced sputum sample immediately after collection for its subsequent processing at the convenience of the laboratory technicians prevents problems caused by enzyme contents in this body fluid that digest fluid and cell components if the sample is not frozen. Different research teams have tested this technique over the last years. [9] [10] [11] [12] In this study, we use this method to assess time dependent changes in IL-4 and IL-5 (Th2 cytokines) and IFN-\u03b3 (Th1 cytokines) in induced sputum samples from asthmatic patients and healthy control individuals with or without airway viral infections. The aims of this study were to establish the antiviral airway immune response patterns in absence or presence of asthmatic immune responses and to identify the possible mechanisms where the relationship between viral airway infections and asthma exacerbations is based.",

We observed that individuals presented with low values for IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-\u03b3 in induced sputum, with barely any fluctuations during the 7 days and that their level of IFN-\u03b3 in the sputum increased rapidly (on day 2) up to high values when these patients contracted viral infection of the upper airways. We also found that viral infection symptoms showed at an early stage and remitted very fast. This shows that healthy individuals have effective antiviral immunity. In induced sputum, IFN-\u03b3 values had a negative correlation with symptoms, as observed on previous studies. 16, 17 We found that individuals with asthma, even in the remission stage, presented with higher values of IL-4 e IL-5 and lower values of IFN-\u03b3 than healthy individuals and higher ratios of IL-4/IFN-and IL-5/ IFN-\u03b3 (p < 0.01). These results confirm that asthmatic individuals have a history of immune system deviation towards a Th2 response, which is consistent with data from research in animals and in clinical settings. [18] [19] [20] [21] Furthermore, during acute exacerbations of asthma, a predominant Th 2deviation is evident. 22 Recent tests indicate that this abnormal deviation towards Th2 activity in asthmatic patients could be related to a decrease in the function of other types of Th cells, i.e., regulator T cells. These cells seem to reduce Th2 activity in healthy individuals. 23 The population of natural aggressor T cells could also play a role in asthma pathogenesis. 24 IFN-\u03b3 values in induced sputum of patients with asthma, even during remission, increased to a lower degree and more slowly than in non-asthmatic individuals. Asthmatic individuals also had a higher viral infection symptom score than healthy individuals. It has been argued that asthmatic patients are not more vulnerable to viral airway infections than patients who do not have asthma, even though they may suffer more serious consequences. 25 This indicates the possibility that they may suffer deterioration of their antiviral responses and, in consequence, develop more prolonged infections that can cause severe airway obstruction and wheezing. It is interesting to highlight that the production of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03bb in response to airway viruses could also be impaired. [26] [27] [28] There is evidence that proves that an insufficient production of IFN-\u03b2 in the airways of asthmatics patients causes a viral infection of epithelial cells. Once infected, these cells can show an inefficient apoptotic response. Consequently, virus can rapidly multiply in these cells and enter the airways, so that the viral load is much higher than that of healthy patients. 28, 29 Furthermore, virus induced IFN-\u03b3 secretion is positively related to lung function in asthmatic individuals. 30 Globally, these findings indicate that deterioration of IFN response could lead to more serious clinical features in viral airway infections in patients suffering from asthma. We also found that symptom scores in these asthmatic patients were much higher than in asthmatic patients without upper airway viral infection. These findings are consistent with a \"likely to exacerbations\" phenotype. 31, 32 However, we did not find any significant differences in IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 and IL-5/IFN-\u03b3 ratios between healthy individuals with or without Table 4 Variations of ratios between IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 and IL-5/IFN-\u03b3 during one week Group A (n = 10) Group B (n = 10) Group C (n = 10) Group D (n = 10)",

This indicates that there are probably other mechanisms that regulate this homeostasis. Recently, in the course of clinical studies, much attention has been given to regulating T lymphocytes and it has been found that they regulate Th1/Th2 homeostasis through a number of mechanisms. 33 In this study, we determine that the time trends of changes in IL-4 and IL-5 in induced sputum of patients with asthma and airway viral infections were consistent with fluctuations in asthma symptoms, since they were more serious 3-5 days after contracting the infection. As a result, we concluded that 3-5 days after contracting a viral infection of the upper airways is the timeframe where infection symptoms worsen in patients with asthma. It is possible to recommend administering treatment as soon as possible during this timeframe.",

In asthmatic patients, the viral infection induced Th1 cell response of the upper airways exacerbates the Th1/Th2 imbalance. This indicates the existence of other mechanisms to control this balance. We found that the timeframe during which infection symptoms begin to worsen in patients with asthma is 3-5 days after contracting the infection. with airway viral infection, but otherwise healthy; group C, with mild or moderate asthma; group D, same as group C, but with airway viral infection (n = 10 per group). The results are means \u00b1 standard deviations. A linear mixed method was used to analyse time trends. When a significant time trend was found, a Tukey test was used for post-hoc analysis.
