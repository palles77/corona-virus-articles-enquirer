The events following binding to CD4 that effect membrane fusion and internalization remain obscure . Many enveloped viruses such as influenza virus, Semliki forest virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus are pH-dependent for entry, whereas others such as paramyxoviruses are pH-independent (Marsh and Helenius, 1989) . HIVs, like most mammalian retroviruses, are pH-independent (Stein etal., 1987 ; McClure etal., 1988 McClure etal., , 1990 , and this is reflected in their capacity to induce cell-to-cell fusion resulting in multinucleated syncytia .",

This alteration is essential for the HA fusion domain to interact with the endosomal membrane and induce fusion of viral and cell membranes (White et al., 1983) . HIV may require a similar change in structure of the gpl20/gp41 spikes to position the putative gp4l fusion domain (Gallagher, 1987 ; Kowalsky et al., 1987) within reach of the cell membrane . Although little is understood about the sequence of events occurring between CD4 binding and membrane fusion, several observations suggest that at least one event is needed at this stage : ' To whom requests for reprints should be addressed .",

Syncytium induction in CD4' cells by chronically infected, HIV-1 producer cells occurs within a few hours and does not require HIV replication . The failure of the CD4 4 non-primate cells to form syncytia indicates that the block to infection occurs at or before membrane fusion . The lack of VSV(HIV-1) pseudotype infection provides further evidence that the site of the restriction occurs before viral penetration and uncoating, as all cell types were fully permissive for VSV replication . Since gpl20 bound to CD4 on transfected non-human cells, but the cells were not permissive to cell fusion or VSV(HIV-1) infection, we assumed that an essential step in infection was lacking aftervirion binding but before uncoating . We therefore investigated whether bound HIV-1 virions would functionally infect cells after treatment with the membrane fusigen, PEG, as the infection of env Rous sarcoma virus has previously been reported by a similar technique (Weiss et at, 1977) . HIV-1 (RF strain, 10 6 TCID) was adsorbed to mink-CD4' cells, which were subsequently exposed to PEG . HIV-1 infection was detected by p24 antigen and by rescue of progeny virus upon cocultivation with the permissive cell line, C8166 . The results (Table 2) demonstrate that mink-CD4' cells are permissive to low-titer replication of HIV-1, provided that entry is mediated through PEG fusion . Thus cell penetration appears to be the block to infection in CD4* nonpermissive cells .",

Titration of these viruses in parallel to HIV-1 revealed significant differences in patterns of susceptibility (Fig . 4a) , and these were reflected in the plating of VSV(HIV-1) and VSV(HIV-2) pseudotypes (Fig . 4b) . For example, human TE671-CD4+ cells were susceptible to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 but not to SIV MAc , whereas human U87 cells were selectively sensitive only to HIV-2 and SIV . The rhesus macaque kidney line LLCMK2 was sensitive only to SIV MAC , whereas another rhesus kidney line, FRhK, also showed a low susceptibility to HIV-2 (Fig . 4) . The two rhesus cell lines were also sensitive to infection by SIV sM (data not shown) . The rhesus monkey cell lines supported chronic production of SIV MAC . CD4 -parental cells were not permissive, and infection of the CD4* lines was blocked by Leu 3a antibody . The Buffalo green monkey (BGM) cell line of AGM did not support HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV MAC , SIVSM , or SIV AGM replication ; however, a low though significant plating of VSV(HIV-2) pseudotype was observed .",

Figure 5 shows the induction of syncytia by HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV MAC in CD4* TE671 and U87 cells . To investigate whether the selective tropisms of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV for the different cell lines was a general property of these virus types, 19 distinct virus strains were examined (Table 3 ) . Ten strains of HIV-1, including 6 African strains with widely divergent env sequences, induced cell fusion in TE671-CD4* cells but not in U87-CD4* cells . Conversely, 6 distinct isolates of HIV-2 induced syncytia in both types of human cell, though LAV -2ROD and CBL-22 did so more efficiently than the other strains in U87 cells . Table 3 also shows differential sensitivity to cell fusion of the simian cell lines expressing human CD4 . The FRhK rhesus line was sensitive to all strains of HIV-2 and SIV whereas the LLCMK2 line was sensitive only to SIVMAC and SIVSM . The BGM line of CLAPHAM, BLANC, AND WEISS African green monkey cells showed differential sensitivity to HIV-2 isolates . It is interesting to note that while the BGM line was sensitive to cell fusion by HIV-2 LAV-2RO0 and by all SIV strains (Table 3) , and to a lesser extent to VSV(HIV-2) pseudotypes (Fig . 4b) , it did not support replication of LAV-2 ROD or SIV MAC (Fig . 4a) . The BGM-CD4* cells thus appear to be permissive for HIV-2 and SIV entry but exert a postpenetration restriction of viral replication .",

(1990) . However, Ashorn et al. identified a minority of non-primate cell lines expressing very high levels of CD4 from a vaccinia vector that supported HIV-1-directed cell fusion after cocultivation with human cells expressing HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins . Interestingly, while these cells supported fusion mediated by HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins expressed on human cells, they were resistant to fusion by cocultivation with mouse cells expressing the HIV-1 glycoproteins, although the latter cells were competent for fusion of CD4+ human cells . These findings suggest that events between virion attachment to CD4 and gp4lmediated membrane fusion may be more complex than previously thought .

Each CD4 -parent line was negative for cell fusion after mixing with cells producing HIV-1 RF, HIV-2 CBL20, and SIVM\"c . viral and cell membranes that allows the introduction of the virion nucleocapsid into the cell cytoplasm . The major histocompatability (MHC) class I antigen has been implicated as an additional requirement to CD4 for HIV-1 infection (Corbeau et al., 1990 ; Devaux et al., 1990) . However, we found that CD4`, class I-deficient Daudi cells became fully sensitive to HIV-1 infection and syncytlum induction after CD4 transfection, although they remained negative for surface expression of MHC class I antigen . Hattori at al. (1989) and Stephens et al. (1990) proposed that one step may involve the cleavage of the gp120 V3 loop by a cellular protease . Trypstatin, an inhibitor of the proteases trypsin and tryptase, inhibited HIV-1 infection and has homology to the GPGR tip of the V3 loop (Hattori at al., 1989) . The V3 loop on gpl 20 is highly variable but conserves either trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like cleavage sites (Clements et al., 1991) . It is possible that cell surface proteases specifically cleaving the V3 loop may determine this step in infection as a prerequisite for fusion . The importance of the V3 loop in HIV tropism has been demonstrated by Takeuchi et aL (1991) , who analyzed a variant of HIV-'GUN that infects CD4' human brain-derived cells, whereas the parental virus replicates in T-cells but not 712 CLAPHAM, BLANC, AND WEISS Cell surface proteases have also been implicated as important in the entry of other enveloped viruses including retroviruses (Andersen, 1983 ; Appleyard and Tisdale, 1985) . Several different proteases including trypsin, a-chymotrypsin, and thermolysin were shown to enhance MLV-induced cell fusion of mouse fibroblasts (Andersen and Skov, 1989) . Cleavage of MLV gp70 normally occurs in the endosomes or lysosomes (Andersen, 1987) , but the XC cell line which is susceptible to MLV-induced cell fusion and is pH-independent for MLV entry may express a cell surface protease that cleaves gpl 20 as well as MLV gp70 (McClure et al., 1990) . CD4` XC cells were therefore included in this study but were not permissive for HIV-1 entry . CD4' rat 2H3 cells secrete an array of proteases when activated by IgE treatment, but these cells were also resistant to HIV infection even after IgE activation . Stephens et at. (1990) showed that recombinant gp120 produced from aging CHO cells was partially cleaved at the V3 loop ; CD4 expression on the cell surface of CHO cells did not render them permissive to HIV infection .",

The viral tropisms we have examined did not correlate with MHC class I expression or with known cell surface protease activity . Selection and analysis of HIV or SIV variants with an altered cell tropism may reveal which region of the virus genome (presumably in the envelope gene) determines this early step during infection .
