Presumably the most important vector within this group, J. ricinus, is abundant in the coastal areas from the southern parts of the country up to Helgeland, near the Arctic circle. It is well-known, under various local names, to the public, mainly because of the connection to bovine piroplasmosis (Tambs-Lyche, 1943b) . The tick of small rodents, I. trianguliceps, is found within the distribution area of J. ricinus, but it is also numerous in inland localities where the latter is absent (see Section 111,2). Ixodes hexagonus has been found in Southern Norway, both within and outside the distribution area of I. ricinus, and is probably active throughout the whole year (Tambs-Lyche, 1943a) . Ixodes lividus was demonstrated by Mehl (1970) in Sand Martin colonies. Ixodes caledonicus was found on a starling in 1965 (Mehl, 1970) . Another bird tick, X. arboricola, was reported by Tambs-Lyche in 1943 (1943a . The seabird tick J. uriae, which has been firmly established as an arbovirus vector during recent years (Lvov et ai., 1975; Traavik and Mehl, 1975; Yunker, 1975) , is abundant in the vast Norwegian seabird colonies. Its ability to attack man has been repeatedly demonstrated (Mehl, 1968; Tambs-Lyche, 1959) . Finally, on various occasions Hyalomma marginatum has been picked off passerine migratory birds arriving in the spring.",

However, these field expeditions mainly took part during late summer and fall and it has been suggested that the seasonal fluctuation of TBE virus may make isolations in early summer more likely (Chumakov et al., 1973) . Accordingly, in 1976 ticks were collected in some selected biotopes in early June. The localities were chosen in accordance with the results of a serological screening of cattle (Traavik, 197 3) . The spring and summer of 1976 were extremely dry and it proved to be hard to catch J. ricinus by the blanket drag method. The expedition was terminated after three days, during which only 3 58 J. ricinus were caught. This was less than half the number usually collected in one day during the preceding years. The ticks were divided into 16 pools according to developmental stage and processed for virus isolation attempts by intracerebral inoculations into newborn mouse litters aged 1-3 days. Five pools yielded mouse-pathogenic agents passing 220 nm filters and two of these virus strains have been shown to be antigenically related to the TBE complex (T. Traavik, R. Mehl, and R. Wiger, 1978a) . Pool \u0395 672 was composed of nine female J. ricinus collected at Lavik in the Sogn og Fjordane county on June 9, while pool 674 was made of 12 male I. ricinus collected at Dragsvik in the same county on the following day. For serological characterization, micro-hemaglutination (Clarke and Casals, 1958) , complement fixation, closed-hexagon immunodiffusion (Traavik et al., 1972; , and immunoelectroosmophoresis (IEOP) Traavik et al., 197'7; Traavik, 1977a) were used. The Czech Hypr strain and a hyperimmune mouse antiserum to this virus were used as references. No antigenic differences between the two Norwegian strains, or between the newly isolated viruses and the Hypr strain, have been revealed so far. However, homologous antisera to the new viruses have not yet been employed in serological tests. No attempts to characterize the remaining three I. ricinus isolates have been made so far (see Section III,F).",

Positive reactions were also verified by immunodiffusion and, to some extent, also after concentration by Lyphogel (Aschavai and Peters, 1971 ). The modified immuno-electroosmophoresis method that was successfully used for Uukuniemi, Runde, Tribec, and Tahyna viruses could not be applied to TBE serology, probably because of the lack of a suitable, highly concentrated antigen preparation (Traavik, 1977a) . The overall prevalence of seropositive individuals was very similar within the distribution areas of J. ricinus for all the species tested and was around 20%: in cattle 18% (Traavik, 1973 and unpublished results) , in humans 20%, and in small rodents 24% were seropositive. Analysis of the seropositive human subjects revealed some interesting features related to sex and age. In men, the prevalence of antibody reactors was essentially unchanged between the ages 10 and 60 years (25-29%), but dropped to 19% for individuals over 60 years of age. In women, a noticeable drop in antibody reactors was demonstrated from the age group 20-30 years (32%) to 30-40 years (17%). Among women over 60 years, only 6-8% had antibodies to TBE. The overall prevalence for men was 24%, for women 16%. Some implications of the serological screening data are discussed in Section III, B,4.",

The explanation of 25% seropositive C. glareolus in a locality where I. ricinus is absent strongly suggests the existence of alternative vector(s). The animals collected at Kviteseid in Telemark county are often strongly infested by J. trianguliceps, which has been proposed as an alternative vector. The serological screening of 383 bank voles captured at Kviteseid poses the question of alternative or tangential transmission cycles for TBE virus. Another problem is presented by the age and sex differences in the human subjects revealed by the anti-TBE antibody screenings mentioned in Section III,B,2. This phenomenon has not been observed in Finland (Salminen et al., 1961) or in Czechoslovakia (Gresikova et al., 1967) . In addition, a lack of correspondence between hemagglutination titers and the ability of the antisera to react in immunodiffusion has been revealed in the present study. One speculative hypothesis may be that there are local, antigenic variants of TBE and that the avidity of antibodies for the Hypr strain decreases with time after infection. According to this interpretation, the age and sex differences could be due to reinfections.",

These two virus strains were shown to have the same biological characteristics. They seemed antigenically identical by the methods employed and also identical to the Finnish prototype strain S 23 . A third virus strain. Ru E82, belonging to the UUK group, was isolated from J. uriae collected in the seabird colonies at Runde, an island in the Mc^re og Romsdal county. This was the same collection from which the two Runde virus strains were isolated (see Section \u0399\u0399\u0399,\u0395,\u0399). The actual pool was composed of five female I. uriae. The Ru E82 strain demonstrated some divergent characteristics and also differed antigenically from S 23 and the two Norwegian strains . All three strains were only weakly active in hemagglutination, but satisfactory antigens were obtained by employing Aerosil-treatment and sonication of sucrose-acetoneextracted mouse brains or cell culture fluids concentrated with polyethylene glycol 6000/NaCl (Traavik, 1977b) . During 1974 and 1975 no UUK viruses were isolated from several thousands of I. ricinus ticks.",

Their ability to multiply in the presence of BUdR points to a single-stranded RNA genome and an inner helical material was seen in partly disrupted particles. These characteristics were reported in detail elsewhere (Traavik and Brunvold, 1978) .

Some of these problems have already been mentioned in the preceding sections. Since it is evident that at least three different arboviruses circulate within the same biotopes by I. ricinus and that antibodies to more than one virus have been detected in some individuals during the screenings, the possibilities of mixed infections in nature might be considered as far from hypothetical (Traavik, 1973; Traavik and Mehl, 1975) . In recent experiments with mixed infections mice were inoculated with two or three viruses (TBE, UUK, Tribec) simultaneously or at different intervals. The ability of mixed infections to modulate the expression of a single virus, both for the benefit or the disadvantage of the host animal, has been demonstrated in these experiments. The ability of Norwegian arboviruses to produce persistent infections should be further investigated and related to the symptoms of selected groups of patients.",

Consequently, in 1975 a typical forest biotope was chosen in Trandum in southeastern Norway, situated close to Oslo, which was used extensively for military training and recreational purposes. The area (Romerike) contains some of the best agricultural and livestock districts of the country. Mosquitoes were also collected at 0yern, the largest delta area in Norway, which has now become a preserved national park and is well-known for its wildlife population, particularly birds. Finally, a subarctic tundra biotope, Masi in Finmark county, situated within an area of great importance for the native Lap population and their reindeer, was also used for the collection of mosquitoes.",

The second strain, S 586, was from 16 male A. diantaeus collected at Trandum on June 17, 1975. The last strain, S 618, was from 100 female A. hexodontus collected at Masi, nearly 70\u00b0N, on August 20, 1975 In the first passage in newborn mice the incubation time was 3-5 days for all strains, and this was shortened to 2-3 days during consecutive passages. Originally, only strain S 586 agglutinated chicken erythrocytes but employing Aerosil treatment and sonication (Traavik, 1977b) , high hemagglutinating activity was recorded for all three strains with trypsinized chicken or human \u039f cells. With a hyperimmune mouse serum to Tahyna virus, all three strains gave identical reactions in the hemagglutination test, while strain S 586 differed from Tahyna virus in immunodiffusion.
