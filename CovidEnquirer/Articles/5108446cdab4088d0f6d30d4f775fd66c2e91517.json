Cranial nerves have their cell bodies within the brain, but most of their nerve fibers course outside the brain. Diseases of the brain and cranial nerves may be neoplastic, infectious, idiopathic, vascular, traumatic, metabolic, toxic, congenital, or degenerative in origin. These disorders may result in dysfunction of a focal, regionally specific brain area or may produce more diffuse or multifocal deficits. Because many different diseases can affect similar areas causing very similar clinical signs, the first portion of this chapter discusses clinical signs of lesions in each brain region. The remainder of the chapter discusses important brain diseases within each etiologic category. Diagnosis of neurologic disease is discussed in Chapter 125, and management of seizures is discussed in Chapter 127.",

Astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas arise mostly from deep intra-axial locations in the brain (usually cerebrum or diencephalon). Ependymomas are relatively uncommon and arise from cells lining any of the ventricular compartments. The lateral ventricles of the cerebrum are the most common sites for ependymoma formation. Choroid plexus papillomas and carcinomas develop in areas of the brain where choroid plexus is present. The most common sites for a choroid plexus papilloma are the fourth ventricle-lateral aperture area and the third ventricle.

These methods correct for possible blood-CSF barrier breakdown by comparing CSF-to-serum ratios of pathogen-specific antibodies against ratios of vaccine-associated (usually adenovirus or calicivirus) antibodies. Non-paired serum titers for toxoplasmosis are unreliable in the dog and cat due to persistence of high antibody titers long after exposure. The antibody coefficient calculation may also be useful to diagnose CNS FIP, although false-negative cases of CNS FIP have been reported. Cryptococcal antigen-specific titers can be run on serum, but CSF titers provide a more definitive diagnosis of CNS involvement. Cryptococcal antibody titers may be falsely negative due to an inadequate humoral immunologic response to the encapsulated organism. Serum titers are useful for diagnosis of neosporosis and rickettsial diseases. Neospora caninum serum antibody titers are usually very high (>1:800) in infected dogs and do not crossreact with toxoplasmosis titers.

Spontaneous hemorrhage in the CNS can occur due to thrombocytopenia, coagulopathies, vasculitis (immune-mediated or infectious), neoplastic invasion of blood vessels (especially from hemangiosarcomas), traumatic or ischemic damage to vessels, or arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms.

            "text": "Severe head trauma can result in acute brain injury. Primary mechanical injury to cell membranes and fiber tracts results in irreversible necrosis. This can take the form of a blunt contusion or a laceration. Secondary events are due to biochemical changes at the cellular level and increased ICP. Excitotoxins, free radicals, prostaglandins, and inflammatory cytokines fuel a selfperpetuating cycle of ischemia and necrosis in the traumatized brain. Intracranial edema and hemorrhage combine to raise ICP, exhaust compensatory mechanisms, and create conditions favorable for brain herniation. Elevated ICP may also lead to bradycardia, systemic hypertension, and neurogenic pulmonary edema. A final immediate or delayed consequence of brain trauma is epilepsy. Seizures can be seen months following head trauma.",
