Our results suggest that the return of the health care sector in the UK (US) stock market leads those in the US and Germany (Germany) stock markets in the short run and medium run, while the returns of the health care sector in the US stock market lead those in the UK stock market in the long run. We find the least (most) structural change in the return of the health care sector for the UK (US) stock market, as both countries belong to two extreme (i.e., public and private) health care systems. There is also an overall increase of long-run interdependence between UK and US health care sectors. Both the subprime mortgage crisis and global financial crisis caused clear contagion effects between the health care sectors of DE and UK as well as those of US and DE. Finally, our results highlight the importance of taking into consideration the time and frequency-varying properties of health care sectors' stock return co-movement in international portfolios.",

There is no doubt that the health care industry is an attractive prospect for investors and its growth is important to long-term economic development (Delloitte, 2014) . The health care sector is unique, in that it is a highly regulated sector, and the government is its largest customer (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the US) . In addition, stocks in the health care sector are often considered to be defensive, because their products and services are indispensable. Even during economic downturns, people still require medical aid and medicine to overcome illness. Thus, a consistent demand for its goods and services makes this sector less sensitive to business cycle fluctuations or mostly unaffected by economic weakness. 1 Given the special feature of the health care sector, do health care sectors co-move across countries?",

The predictive power of UK for DE and US is over the short run and medium run; while that of US for DE is across the medium and long run; and that of US for UK is over the long run. Therefore, investors can follow the health care stock price pattern of US (UK) to predict long-(short-) run health care stock prices. Second, UK health care returns are statistically significant only for the short run, indicating no significant variance for the medium and long runs. However, US health care returns exhibit significantly low wavelet power across the short, medium, and long runs. The health care policies of UK (which belongs to the National Health Service) and US (which belongs to the Private Insurance System) both belong to two extreme systems. In addition, there is an overall increase of long-run interdependence between the UK and US health care sectors. Both the subprime mortgage crisis and global financial crisis caused clear contagion effects between the sectors of DE and UK as well as those of US and DE. Third, Barro (2013) pinpoint that health is an important determinant of economic growth, but we find that cross-country comovement in the health care sector, which is highly regulated, may be a by-product of common movements in economic fundamentals (such as industrial production and GDP).",

In general, there are two classes of wavelet transforms: the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the continuous wavelet transform (CWT).

In general, the Mortlet wavelet has some good mathematical properties as follows. First, for numerical purposes it can be treated as an analytic wavelet. Second, the peak frequency, the energy frequency, and the central instantaneous frequency of the Mortlet wavelet are all equal. Third, the Mortlet wavelet has optimal joint time-frequency concentration in the sense that the Heisenberg box area reaches its lower bound with this wavelet. Finally, the time radius and the frequency radius are equal (Aguiar-Conraria & Soares, 2014) .

First, the continuous wavelet analysis mostly relies on pairwise correlations within a multivariate set of health care financing systems . It generates n(n\u22121)/2 (n meaning the number of target variables or markets) wavelet correlation graphs and J\u00d7n(n\u22121)/2 (J is the number of scales) phrase-differences graphs. In the current paper, our continuous wavelet analysis produces 3 wavelet correlation graphs and 9 phrase-differences graphs. If the number of markets under investigation increases from three to four, then we need to analyze 6 wavelet correlation graphs and 18 phrase-differences graphs. This is a restriction of the continuous wavelet analysis, and it makes the continuous wavelet analysis intractable, because the number of target markets is higher than three. Second, we choose the Germany, UK, and US stock markets as our target countries, because the health care systems in these three countries represent three major types of health care systems among OECD countries: the Social Health Insurance (Germany), National Health Service (UK), and Private Insurance (US) systems (Rothgang, 2010) . Previous studies analyzing the factors influencing stock prices associated with the health care sector also select these three typical countries .",

To control the impact of macroeconomic differences across different countries, most studies include either real GDP or an industrial production index as a control variable. We use the industrial production index, because wavelet analysis is quite data demanding and having monthly data is a plus (Aguiar-Conraria et al., 2012) . It is worth addressing that Andersen et al. (2007) demonstrate that many of the significant jumps are associated with specific macroeconomic news announcements. However, they suggest that many of the jumps identified by the high frequency-based realized variation measures are invariably hidden in the coarser daily or lower-frequency returns. The low-frequency (monthly) data used in this study slightly aggregate the heterogeneity in a smoothing way (Sun, Rachev, Stoyanov, & Fabozzi, 2008) . Therefore, the effects of asymmetry and jumps in the returns series during the crises of our analyses could be minor and can be neglected. Table 1 Around 2008, the three price indices begin to exhibit a relative decline, impacted by the US subprime mortgage crisis, the global financial crisis, and the European debt crisis. Table 2 and Fig. 2A -C illustrate the wavelet power spectrum for the health care sector stock returns of DE, UK, and US, respectively. In the horizontal axis of Fig. 2 , we have the time dimension, while the vertical axis gives us the frequency dimension, which is based on monthly data. The power is given by the color, and the wavelet power varies from deep red (highest) to deep blue (lowest). Regions with warm colors (red) represent areas of high power. The white lines show the maxima of the undulations of the wavelet power spectrum, therefore giving us a more precise estimate of the cycle period. The black contour designates the regions where the wavelet power is statistically significant at 5% (Aguiar-Conraria et al., 2010) .",

The results outside the COI region may not be reliable (Aguiar-Conraria & Soares, 2014; Cazelles, Chavez, de Magny, Gu\u00e9gan, & Hales, 2007) , and so we discuss the wavelet power specters inside the COI in this study. The wavelet power spectrums in Fig. 2A and the second column of Table 2 show significant (at 5% significance level) volatilities of the DE health care returns for high frequency (1-2 months) over the periods 2000-2003 and 2007-2010 , for the 2-4 months' frequency band in 2004-2010, and for low frequency (4-8 months) in 2003-2010, when the DE health care sector experienced the Doc-com bubble, SARS epidemic, subprime mortgage crisis, global financial crisis, and European debt crisis. These findings suggest that there are significant variances and structural changes in the DE health care stock returns. In fact, a structural change in the DE health care returns also occurs on cycles of wavelet power across the medium run (2-4 months) and long run (4-8 months) during the periods 2004-2010 and 2003-2010, which as mentioned above is within the period of the SARS outbreak, subprime mortgage crisis, global financial crisis, and European debt crisis. Those significant volatilities at different frequency bands identified over various periods suggest that the above-mentioned events are likely to have influenced the DE health care returns in all ranges of frequency bands. The white lines on the short, medium, and long periods across all times mean that there is a permanent cycle with DE health care sector returns. In sum, DE health care returns exhibit high wavelet power across the 1-8 months' frequency bands during 2000-2010.",

These findings suggest that there are structural changes in the UK health care stock returns in the high (1-2 months) frequency during the five above-mentioned crises. However, there are no significant volatilities of the UK health care sector during medium and long runs. We observe a white line across the observed periods, indicating that there is a permanent cycle for the medium run.

However, comparing with the wavelet coherency and phasing difference, partial wavelet coherencies together with partial phasedifferences provide more reliable indications of correlation and lead-lag relationships between health care returns. Thus, we also analyze partial wavelet coherencies and partial phase-differences. We split the frequency on the vertical axis into three bands: 1-2, 2-4, and 4-8 months, corresponding to short, medium, and long runs, respectively. Following Aguiar-Conraria et al. (2012), we can read the results following a few rules that allow for an economic interpretation of the phase-difference. Fig. 3A and Table 3A show positive and strong co-movement between DE (denoted by x(t)) and UK health care returns (denoted by y(t)) between 2005-2013 for cycles in frequency bands of 1-8 months. The co-movement, however, does depend on the frequency Figures A2-A4 and B2-B4 are phase-differences and partial phase-differences at 1-2, 2-4, and 4-8 months' frequency bands after controlling for the industrial production indices of DE and UK, respectively. Notes: The black contour designates the 5% significance level. Coherency ranges from blue (low coherency) to red (high coherency), plus or minus two standard deviations. The line represents the phase-difference. A phase-difference between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2 means that both series are in-phase. Between -\u03c0/2 and zero as well as between \u03c0/2 and \u03c0 mean that UK is leading DE. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article). and is unstable over the period 2000-2011. More specifically, for 2000-2002, 2005-2006, and 2007-2010 , the two sectors' returns show significant co-movement across the 1-2 months' frequency band with an in-phase relation indicated by the phase-difference between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, 6 implying a positive co-movement despite frequent boom-bust fluctuations in the two markets during these periods. From 2003 From -2004 From and 2005 From -2011 , we observe mostly positive co-movement and UK leads DE across the 2-4 months' frequency band. For 2004-2011, UK positively leading DE appears to be long lasting around the 4-8 months' frequency band. These findings support the existence of time and frequency-varying features in the correlations between the DE and UK health care returns. We find mostly positive causal links from UK to DE in the medium and long runs. The fundamentals of real economic factors (i.e., industrial production), however, might influence the relationship between the sample's health care sector returns. This implies that the above results estimated by wavelet coherency and phase-difference, without removing the simultaneous effects of industrial production on the two returns, may suffer from inaccuracy. 7 Thus, we further estimate the partial wavelet coherency and partial phase-difference with industrial production as a control variable to reveal the relationship between the two returns in Fig. 3B and Table 3B .",

For 1993-2009, we find a high degree of positive causality from UK to US at the 1-2 months' frequency band, revealing that within this period UK leads US over the short term. For 1994 For -1996 For and 1999 For -2006 we also find that a high degree of positive causality from UK to US increases at the 2-4 months' frequency band, in contrast with the two conversion causalities without controlling for industrial production in Table 5A . Unlike the previous result indicating a reverse from US leading UK to UK leading US in the long run, we now clearly see a high degree of long-term causality from US to UK as indicated by the partial wavelet coherency. 6 For example, we note the phase-difference (blue line) between -\u03c0/2 and 0 in Fig. 3A.2 7 We also control for a global financial crisis factor, but no significant result is obtained. Figures A2-A4 and B2-B4 are phase-differences and partial phase-differences at 1-2, 2-4, and 4-8 months' frequency bands after controlling for the industrial production indices of DE and US, respectively. Notes: The black contour designates the 5% significance level. Coherency ranges from blue (low coherency) to red (high coherency), plus or minus two standard deviations. The line represents the phase-difference. A phase-difference between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2 means that both series are in-phase. Between -\u03c0/2 and zero as well as between \u03c0/2 and \u03c0 mean US is leading DE. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article). This may imply that UK and US returns may depend fundamentally on industrial production. All of the relations between UK and US are positive (when the partial phase-difference is within \u03c0/2 and \u2212\u03c0/2). In summary, when mapping the timings of six events in Fig. 1 to Figs. 3B1-5B1, there is an overall increase of long-run interdependence between UK and US during the studied time period, and the increase is slightly weaker after 2009. The 2003 SARS outbreak, subprime mortgage crisis, and global financial crisis all cause clear contagion effects between DE and UK. Around the Dotcom bubble, subprime mortgage crisis, and global financial crisis there are also signs of contagion between DE and US. In addition, Figures A2-A4 and B2-B4 are phasedifferences and partial phase-differences at 1-2, 2-4, and 4-8 months' frequency bands after controlling for the industrial production indices of UK and US, respectively.

UK leads US for the 1-2 and 2-4 months' frequency bands, while US leads UK for the 4-8 months' frequency band. As expected, the co-movement is related closely with financial or important events (i.e., SARS outbreak). Consistent with Erdogan et al. (2013) , our findings of a high level of co-movements should signal that the contagion effects are evident for bad as well as good events spreading over different markets. In summary, the predictive power of UK for both DE and US is in the short and medium runs; that of US for DE is at low and medium frequencies; and that of US for UK is over the long run.",

            "text": "The UK National Health Service offers comprehensive services to the entire population funded mainly out of general taxation (Hurst, 1991) . Under the US private health care system, health care is rationed primarily according to willingness and ability to pay, and state involvement is minimal and limited to providing a minimum standard of care for the poor (Wagstaff et al., 1989) . The German Social Health Insurance system has a mix of compulsory social insurance for about 75% of the population and voluntary insurance for about 23% of the population (Hurst, 1991) . Among the three health care systems, the UK and US policies are the two extreme systems, as we observe from the diverse patterns of the UK and US wavelet power spectrums. Thus, the type of health care system might influence the power spectrum of health care sector returns. International comparisons of health care sector returns offer an opportunity for countries to learn from each other's experiences in managing health care systems as well as health care capital markets. Our findings obtained from the wavelet analyses allow us to address the controversies about the causality of health care returns in major countries under a new light. Wavelet analysis also helps us to uncover that the dynamics in health care are less similar than the conventional defensive nature of health care sector returns would lead us to believe. We uncover a pattern in which more than one cycle component (a \"long\" one of 4-8 months, a \"medium\" one of 2-4 months, and a \"short\" one of 1-2 months) contributes to explain the variance in a series. Our findings show that the causality of health care returns is not a feature of the entire period, but instead is temporally localized. We find that a changing relationship between two sectors' returns coincidently happens with a financial crisis or an important event. For example, for 1997 For example, for -1998 For example, for and 2007 For example, for -2010 We find that a stable positive causality holds during the sample period. Market performance forecasts should focus on UK (US) returns in the short and medium runs so as to enhance forecasting the health care sector returns of DE and US (DE); as well as focus on US returns in the long run so as to predict UK health care sector returns. The causality between the two returns helps policy makers and investors to forecast future health care performance from one market to another. As such, a rise in UK health care returns and hence a gain in US health care returns increase DE returns in the short and medium runs, while a rise in US health care returns increases UK returns in the long run.",

            "text": "Note that there are several limitations to this study. First, we are aware that the dynamic relationship between health care sector returns may be confounded by life style, GDP, cultural, cost of living (measured by the consumer price index, CPI), and other factors. Nevertheless, the monthly data for most of these factors are not available for us to use in conducting a reliable time series analysis. Second, although continuous wavelet analyses provide a complete picture of the lead-lag relation and the correlation between sector returns, the magnitude of the impact from leading countries' sector returns remains unknown. Thus, in the future a wavelet analysis type of regression model with more countries included should be developed and used to illustrate the dynamic relationship between health care sector returns . Third, there may be spillovers between different industries that also determine the bilateral co-movement between health industry stock market returns. The restriction of the continuous wavelet analysis does not provide a tractable method to model the spillovers across different industries. We note that future studies could provide an examination across different industries under the analytical framework of more advanced wavelet analysis. Fourth, we only observe a lead-lag relationship between two returns of those price indices, and the spillover effect is one possible interpretation of the existence of the lead-lag relationship. Since we do not have stabilizing measures during financial crises, this restriction of the data prevents us from exploring whether or not the lead-lag relationship between two returns of those price indices is caused by stabilizing policies (effects). We need more detailed data for further research in this regard.",

This study provides new insights into the co-movement and lead-lag relationships among DE, UK, and US health care sector returns for 1992-2013. To analyze the issue more in-depth, this study has decomposed the time-frequency relationship between sector returns by using the continuous wavelet approach. We are thus able to examine the coherency of the sample health care sector returns and lead-lag relations at different frequencies of specific time periods. We also control for industrial production so as to reveal the true relationships between the three markets' returns by means of the partial wavelet coherency and partial phase-differences.",

Therefore, investors can follow the health care stock price pattern of US (UK) to predict long-(short-) run health care stock prices. Second, UK health care returns are statistically significant only for the short run, indicating no significant variance for the medium and long runs. However, US health care returns exhibit significantly low wavelet power across the short, medium, and long runs. The health care policies of UK (which belongs to the National Health Service) and US (which belongs to the Private Insurance System) are two extreme systems. Thus, different health care policies might influence the patterns of the health care sector returns. In addition, there is an overall increase of long-run interdependence between UK and US health care sectors. Both the subprime mortgage crisis and global financial crisis caused clear contagion effects between the sectors of DE and UK as well as those of US and DE. Third, Barro (2013) pinpoint that health is an important determinant of economic growth, but we find that cross-country co-movement in the health care sector, which is highly regulated, may be the by-product of common movements in economic fundamentals (such as industrial production and GDP). Finally, our results highlight the importance of taking into consideration the time and frequency-varying properties of health care sectors' stock return co-movements in international portfolios as they may influence the benefits of international portfolio diversification.",

From 1992 to 1994, UK suffers from a continuous decline, while DE and US show flatter trends. During 2002-2003, DE, UK, and US suffer from a continuous decline, because during this period the world economy was affected by the SARS disease as indicated by the three major health care stock markets showing a relatively consistent trend.

In 2000-2002 (Doc-com bubble) and 2008-2011 (global financial crisis and the European debt crisis), the co-movements reverse from DE positively leading US to US positively leading DE in the 1-2 months' frequency band, suggesting that returns in DE significantly affect the returns in US during this timeframe. We also observe that US saliently and positively leads DE in the 2-4 months' frequency band around 2002-2012 and in the 4-8 months' frequency band around 2001-2007. This provides evidence that US returns significantly affect DE returns during 2000-2012 in the medium and long runs. Overall, as displayed in Fig. 4A, substantial time and frequency-variations do exist in the causal relationship between DE and US, while for all of the times the coherency is positive for the 1-8 months' frequency band.",
