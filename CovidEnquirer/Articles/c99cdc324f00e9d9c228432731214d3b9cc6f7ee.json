            "text": "During the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, the development of best practices and research surrounding Ebola virus disease (EVD) care and management were primarily focused on health care workers. However, as the U.S. medical community, and specifically high-level isolation units, began to successfully treat individuals with EVD, nonclinical aspects of EVD care were recognized as equally important in containing the virus and minimizing occupational risks. After the care of EVD patients, the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit identified proper medical waste management and disposal as a crucial component and point of consideration for U.S. health care facilities treating EVD patients. 1 An international hazard analysis of critical control points for EVD also emphasized that waste generated from the care of an EVD patient should not be disregarded as a potential transmission route. 2 Medical waste produced through routine patient care is classified as category B or regulated medical waste per U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) federal regulations in tandem with state medical waste regulations; therefore, medical waste processing varies from state to state. The DOT dictates the regulations for transport of category B infectious substances or regulated medical waste, which can be handled by most waste facilities and landfills throughout the nation so long as the waste is contained in leak-proof, properly marked packaging. 3 However, waste contaminated with EVD and some other highly infectious organisms is categorized as category A infectious substances. 4 Solids contaminated with category A infectious substances are regulated by government agencies, including the DOT, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency, which does not typically regulate medical waste. 4 Minimum criteria are required of facilities to accept category A waste for ultimate disposal. This includes category A agents (UN2814) such as Crimean-Congo virus, Yersinia pestis, and EVD that must be handled and transported under stringent federal regulations and procedures dictated by the DOT Hazardous Materials Regulation (49 CFR Parts 171-180) when transported by air, rail, highway, or water. 4 The Nebraska Biocontainment Unit suggested that EVD medical waste management planning should incorporate detailed processes on how to safely handle and remove category A waste from the medical facility, including considerations for increased operational planning and financial burdens. 1 Specifically, if category A waste contaminated with EVD is not treated via incineration or autoclaving onsite at the point of generation to inactivate or entirely remove the virus, a DOT special permit must be obtained and special category A packaging that meets the regulatory federal requirements for packaging of the DOT and Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration must be used to transport it from the health care facility. 1, 4 If off-site inactivation is required, medical facility and local government leadership, approved waste transportation and treatment facilities willing to accept the waste, state and local health departments, environmental agencies, and other units must collectively work to ensure that waste movement is compliant with inter-and intrastate regulations. The ultimate disposition of the category A waste at the offsite facility must also take into account residuals produced from inactivation. 4 Interim planning guidance has been issued as of January 2017, but there is not a mandatory nationwide industry standard established which dictates that all medical waste facilities must be ready to handle category A waste. 4 As a result of the distinct complexity and regulatory framework for the management and disposal of medical waste contaminated with EVD, only a small number of U.S. waste processing facilities were willing to accept EVD waste. [5] [6] [7] [8] This limited capacity not only presented logistical barriers but also raised concerns about waste worker preparedness to handle category A regulated infectious waste. Furthermore, few peer-reviewed articles specifically pertaining to the United States focus on the safe handling of category A waste or tangentially relate to highly infectious waste treatment [9] [10] [11] ; those that do discuss category A waste, in Europe, do not follow the same classification system as the United States.",

We adapted a similar structure to conduct a survey in the death care sector. 13 In the fall of 2016, this medical waste gap-analysis survey was distributed via Qualtrics Software Version 2016.17 (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) (Institutional Review Board exemption Indiana University Kuali Coeus no. 1607534532). Two surveys were developed-one at the lead-supervisor-management level (lead) and the other at the worker-employee level (worker) and divided into 3 sections: (1) demographics; (2) industry-specific questions on comfortability and willingness to encounter HID scenarios, and current policies and procedures in place to address category A waste; and (3) levels of knowledge, training, resources, and personal protective equipment (PPE) to address HID scenarios. Sections 1 (9 questions) and 3 (6 questions) were identical in the lead and worker pilot surveys, with the only discrepancy being the directive pronoun. Section 2 at the lead level was 63 questions, whereas section 2 at the worker level was only 4 questions because the former asked detailed questions on organizational waste policies and procedures. Survey participants were able to select the link to which survey they felt was more appropriate-worker or lead. The survey predominantly consisted of multiple choice questions, lending the ability to provide qualitative responses where appropriate. Descriptive statistics were deliberately used given this being a pilot survey and the smaller sample size.",

Most states at the time of the EVD outbreak had no separate regulations on the management and treatment of HID waste because most states had never encountered this scenario and had not contemplated this in their rule making or statutory processes. Additionally, because regulations on the management and disposal of normal regulated medical waste vary from state to state, logistical challenges arise for organizations operating in multiple states, further complicating the situation. Interstate movement of the category A waste may result in circuitous rerouting around states that will not allow category A waste to enter because of misunderstanding of many state agencies and political entities. 4 Although there was no specific regulatory or statutory restriction, governor's offices and regulatory agencies used their given authority to stop the entry of the waste through their states, often citing safety as the reason to limit commerce, such as the EVD waste blocked from entering Louisiana in 2014. 14 Although the DOT issued SP intended to show these materials were safe to transport across all states (because DOT Hazardous Materials Regulation is preemptive), the special hypersensitivity to the situation led to rerouting of the waste.",

In the event of another HID incident such as the EVD outbreak, this could result in issues efficaciously and swiftly responding to the outbreak. Limiting or prohibiting category A waste transport or disposal will undoubtedly increase the complexity for waste generators-including hospitals, ambulances, and decontamination or cleanup facilities-to safely and properly dispose of waste in a timely manner. Ultimately, this will result in the need for storage capacity for holding wastes that increase in volume, will result in waste having to travel longer distances for treatment and disposal creating greater safety risk during transport (accidents, incidents of tampering, and security), and will increase costs across all fronts. As other companies see these restrictions, they may be less willing to take these types of waste.

On the extremes of the Likert scale, 20% more workers reported being very willing to handle highly infectious waste than leads Table 2 Reported percentages of lead perceptions of worker comfortability versus worker actual self-reported comfortability to encounter potential highly infectious waste scenarios Very comfortable  Somewhat comfortable   Neither comfortable nor  uncomfortable  Somewhat uncomfortable  Very uncomfortable   Lead response  18  36  9  18  18  Worker response  17  17  8  25  33   Table 3 How pilot survey respondents receive up-to-date information on HIDs perceived; however, 10% more workers were very unwilling than leads perceived (Table 2) . Alternatively, 20% more leads perceived workers to be somewhat comfortable handling highly infectious waste, and more workers reporting they would be very uncomfortable (approximately 15% more than leads perceived) handling highly infectious waste ( Table 3 ). The hesitance and discomfort to work with highly infectious waste could be tied to a lack of knowledge and training related to HIDs provided to workers. Category A waste that is properly packaged in compliance with DOT requirements or inactivated poses no risk to the transporter to the ultimate waste disposal facility. 4 Continuing in the vein of current levels of HID knowledge and training of the pilot survey respondents, although over half of leads used government Web sites or their national organization's Web site for up-to-date information, >70% of workers relied on coworkers, word-of-mouth, or company-appointed individuals to convey them information, introducing possibilities for miscommunication, education that is not comprehensive, or misinformation. This emphasizes the importance of more in-person trainings within facilities. Moreover, there was a large discrepancy between workers and leads when asked if workers had to successfully demonstrate competence of skills or procedures prior to working in potential highly infectious waste scenarios, with 75% more workers than leads reporting that they were not required to do so. Trainee demonstration is crucial to the successful completion of training and to improve occupational safety and health outcomes. 15 Additionally, workers and leads were asked about PPE and hand hygiene. Twenty percent more workers than leads reported their organization did not have procedures for health monitoring after workers encountered infectious substances regardless of exposure status; however, nearly 40% more workers than leads thought there was an employee assistance program (EAP) available to them even though not as many leads indicated their organization had an EAP. Regardless of exposure, health monitoring and surveillance is crucial to assess the physical and mental state of workers prior to, during, and after increased occupational demands and logistics involved with handling and transporting category A waste; making the existence of an EAP widely known is also instrumental for maintaining worker emotional and physical well-being. More workers than leads (approximately 10% difference) stated their organization did not have protocols-procedures for maximum shifts in PPE nor strategies in place for monitoring correct PPE usage. Not having policies on maximum shift times in PPE can create physiologic and psychologic distress for the worker. 16 Finally, >70% of workers and leads stated there were no procedures established at their organization to ensure compliance with proper hand hygiene. This highlights a lack of basic infection control practices or potential misunderstanding of handwashing application related to the management of HIDs, even though it is emphasized in the DOT EVD waste planning guidance for handling solid waste contaminated with category A infectious substances. 4 Waste operations perform a quiet but vital daily function by safely removing regulated medical waste, transporting it, and treating it to render it noninfectious for proper ultimate disposal; highly infectious waste can be done the same way. Of course, additional precautions should be taken, including adequate validation of processes and training of employees.",

The sample size of this pilot survey is not generalizable to the entire medical waste industry; there is need for greater participation in a larger study to determine overall industry preparedness to mitigate and manage highly infectious waste risks. Additionally, because of the sample size, more complex statistical methods were not used. Furthermore, selection bias is possible because of the voluntary nature of the survey, and the high nonresponse rate may indicate organizations that do not intend to accept highly infectious waste and therefore disregarded the survey. The greatest response rates appear to be in regions that had facilities that accepted the waste during the EVD outbreak. Moreover, although survey links were distributed by medical waste organizations, the survey was developed and had logos of an external entity, which typically elicits lower response rates.",

Willingness for organizations to manage this waste and properly preparing for such events will be critical for the future. The implications of having unprepared, uninformed workers can have widespread consequences if category A waste is not properly contained or handled, such as not only compromising the safety and health of the worker, but also the communities through which that waste is transported. The pilot survey was beneficial in that it highlights the gaps in preparedness in this industry; however, the sample size is limited because of few organizations having any experience with category A waste. In some cases, some organizations made their own determination not to provide services, whereas others were prohibited by their state and local agencies. The rapid change in information and the lack of transmission of information during this time could also have led to the low response. Fortunately, this is also because of the limited number of U.S. patients and incidents that occurred.",
