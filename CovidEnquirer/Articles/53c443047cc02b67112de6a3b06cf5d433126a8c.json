Strictly speaking, leakage of pancreatic enzymes secondary to pancreatic inflammation or injury is also a form of chemical peritonitis, although generally it is confined to the tissues immediately surrounding the pancreas. Theoretically, the leakage of stomach or bowel content also may be considered a type of chemical peritonitis, although bacterial peritonitis is probably a more appropriate designation (see later discussion).",
