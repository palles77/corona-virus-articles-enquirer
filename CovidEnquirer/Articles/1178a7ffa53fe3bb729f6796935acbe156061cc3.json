Within the genus Parvovirus, there are several closely related viruses including feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), mouse minute virus (MMV), mink enteritis virus (MEV) and canine parvovirus (CPV) (Hueffer and Parrish, 2003; Steinel et al., 2001) . FPV has been known since the 1920s, whereas CPV only emerged as a dog pathogen in the late 1970s (Appel et al., 1979; Carmichael and Binn, 1981) . The origin of CPV is still not clear but it is arguable that CPV originated from FPV or a very closely related carnivore parvovirus (Barker et al., 1983; Horiuchi et al., 1998; Hueffer et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "The important difference between these two parvoviruses is that FPV varies at a slow rate by random genetic drift, whereas CPV shows genomic substitution rates similar to those of RNA viruses, with values of about 10 \u00c04 substitutions per site per year under selection pressure (Hoelzer et al., 2008; Shackelton et al., 2005) . Evidence suggests that the original type 2 (CPV-2) came from FPV infecting only cats in 1978, and gave rise to the antigenic variant CPV-2a through five or six amino acid mutations in the major capsid protein VP2 during 1979 -1981 (Parrish et al., 1988 Parrish et al., 1985) . A second variant, CPV-2b, was identified in 1986, which naturally infects dogs and cats (Parrish et al., 1991) . A third variant, CPV-2c, was discovered in Italy in 2000, displaying an exceptional ability to spread rapidly through the canine population in that country (Buonavoglia et al., 2001; Martella et al., 2005) , as well as in other European countries, Asia (Nakamura et al., 2004) and America (Kapil et al., 2007) . Although the first reports suggested a low pathogenicity of CPV-2c, experimental data and field observations now indicate a more severe clinical course and higher mortality rates associated with CPV-2c infection, as well as an ability to infect and cause disease in adult dogs, even if repeatedly vaccinated (Decaro et al., 2008a) . A feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) mutant, monkey/BJ-22/2008/CHN, was isolated from intestinal contents of a diarrheic monkey in Beijing, China. The virus was identified by morphology and physicochemical characteristics, and specific fragments were obtained by PCR using consensus primers of parvovirus and specific primers of FPV. Sequence of the full-length VP2 gene of the isolated FPV was determined and analyzed by comparison with reference FPV and canine parvovirus (CPV) isolates, showing high homology with FPV (98.75%) and CPV (98.15%). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the isolated FPV formed a monophyletic branch in FPV cluster which differed from the other 11 FPV isolates from China and other countries. The isolated virus caused typical clinical symptoms of FPV in cats. This is the first report on isolation of FPV from a monkey.",

The bloody purulent stool first emerged in some rhesus monkeys. Three weeks later, about 200 (70%) 2year-old young monkeys in a building displayed haemorrhagic diarrhoea, fever and anorexia, and underwent a fatal outcome with a mortality of 50%, within 3-5 days after the onset of the clinical signs. There were also about 300 adult monkeys presented mild clinical signs, among which 10% died. The HI titers of healthy, died, and recovered monkeys were 2 7-9 , 2 6-7 , and 2 10-11 , respectively. All these monkeys did not directly contact with cats and dogs, whose disease was probably related to some monkeys recently bought from GuangXi Provine, China.",

These amino acid changes affect the viral surface structure facilitating replication in canine cells and leading to loss of the feline host range (Parker and Parrish, 1997) . Amino acids at positions 80, 93, 103, 323, 564 and 568 of VP2 are conserved among all CPV and FPV viruses (Steinel et al., 2000; Decaro et al., 2008a,b) . CPV sequences at amino acid positions 93, 103 and 323 are critical for the ability to replicate in the dog, whereas the FPV sequence at amino acids 80, 564 and 568 are required for replication in the cat. The feline host range of the new antigenic types CPV-2a and CPV-2b is most likely determined by amino acid changes at positions 87, 300 and 305 (Truyen et al., 1996; Parrish, 1999) . Amino acid differences at positions 87, 300 and 305 define the new antigenic types CPV-2a and -2b. Amino acid 426 is conserved in FPV, CPV-2 and CPV-2a viruses but is different in CPV-2b virus (Parrish et al., 1991; Steinel et al., 2000) . The amino acids at positions 323 and 564 of VP2 from the isolated parvovirus are identical with those of CPV, and the other eight positions are identical to FPV ( Table 2 ). The amino acid changes at positions 323 and 564 of VP2 from FPV may alter the host range of FPV, gaining the ability to infect monkeys, but this remains to be determined. The parvovirus HI titers in the monkeys indicated that these monkeys have certain anti-FPV antibody titers, which did not effectively protect against FPV infection. However, the recovered monkeys can produce higher anti-FPV antibody titers and can protect against FPV infection.",

Gene mutation, deletion or arrangement of some key sites in these viruses have been responsible for changes of their host range and pathogenicity. The isolation of an FPV mutant from a primate, therefore, provides some cause for concern, and indicates the need to conduct further studies of its pathogenesis and differential diagnosis.",
