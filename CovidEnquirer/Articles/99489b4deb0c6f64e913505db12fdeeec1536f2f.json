            "text": "Health management of dairy replacements begins before the replacements are born. Several factors, such as nutrition of lactating and dry cows, vaccinations of lactating and dry cows, length of dry periods, cleanliness of the calving environment and disease status of the dams, will ultimately affect disease resistance and health of replacements. It is important to note, however, that cows that are overfed tend to have dif\u00aeculty calving because of being excessively overconditioned. Cows that are underfed, which results in mineral or vitamin de\u00aeciencies or lack of body condition, may produce inferior and lowvolume colostrum. They also may experience dif\u00aeculty calving. Protein de\u00aeciency in cows during the dry period may lead to low birth weights, low metabolic rates and poor vigour of calves, resulting in poor survivability. Some research also indicates that inadequate protein and energy nutrition of the dam results in poor absorption of immunoglobulins from colostrum by the calf. Cows that lose condition during the dry period are also at greater risk of experiencing calving dif\u00aeculty. Calves that experience dif\u00aecult births require more time before being able to stand, experience an increase in the time to voluntary suckling and have a decreased ability to absorb immunoglobulins. All these problems result in decreased transfer of passive immunity from the dam to the calf and increased risk of disease in calves. As the degree of calving dif\u00aeculty increases, the risk of mortality for calves increases. Proper nutrition of dairy cows during lactation and the dry period will help decrease disease risks for replacements.",

            "text": "Vaccinations of the dams will also impact disease resistance of dairy replacements. Proper vaccination of the dairy herd will increase the concentration of antibodies (immunoglobulins speci\u00aec for diseases) in colostrum. Dams may be vaccinated during the dry period against pathogens that are common causes of diarrhoea in calves, such as Escherichia coli, rotavirus and coronavirus. Vaccination of the dams increases the concentration of antibodies against these pathogens in colostrum, thus providing increased protection for calves, resulting in decreased incidence or duration of diarrhoea. Vaccination of the dams during the dry period is more effective for prevention of disease in calves than vaccination of calves at an early age. The immune system of neonatal calves is unable to respond quickly to a vaccination or an infection because the immune system of the newborn is immature at birth. Both numbers and effectiveness of antibody-producing cells are lower in calves at birth than in adult cattle. Therefore, it is important for calves to obtain antibodies against common diseases of calves by consumption of colostrum rather than from an attempt to vaccinate calves at an early age. Vaccination of the dams against pneumonia may also help to decrease the incidence or severity of this disease in replacements.",

A dry period that is too short, i.e. less than 6 weeks, may not provide enough time for involution of the mammary gland and preparation for the next lactation. Cows with shortened dry periods produce small quantities of colostrum that may also have low concentrations of immunoglobulins. It is important for health of replacements, therefore, that cows have at least a 6-week dry period for production of highquality colostrum.",

Wet, sloppy stalls provide a perfect environment for growth of bacteria. Calving on a grass lot may be the best alternative when the climate is dry and mild. If a maternity barn is used, it is important to clean stalls thoroughly between calvings to prevent transfer of disease. Maternity stalls should only be used for calving and never for housing sick cows. Maternity pens and sick pens should be kept in separate facilities in order to prevent transfer of disease to highly vulnerable neonates and periparturient dairy cows. It is also important for the cows to be as clean as possible at calving in order to prevent calves from contracting disease organisms when suckling or attempting to suckle their dams. Preferably, calves should be separated from dams prior to suckling in order to prevent the calf from ingesting pathogens present on the legs, belly,\u00afanks or udder of the cow as the calf attempts to nurse. Separating the calf from the dam and feeding colostrum by bottle also ensures adequate intake of colostrum for transfer of passive immunity from the dam.",

            "text": "The importance for baby calves of adequate consumption of immunoglobulins from colostrum has been reviewed elsewhere (see Replacement Management, Cattle: Preruminant Diets and Weaning Practices). Mortality resulting from lack of consumption of adequate amounts of immunoglobulins is commonly greater than 35% and has been reported to be as high as 60%. Others have indicated a 74-fold increased risk of mortality when calves do not consume colostrum. Along with economic losses from high mortality rates as a result of lack of colostrum consumption, there are also increased costs associated with increased medication and poor feed ef\u00aeciency. Transfer of passive immunity (absorption of immunoglobulins from colostrum) can be determined using commercial kits that measure immunoglobulins in the blood. For adequate protection of calves, blood immunoglobulin concentrations should be at least 10 mg ml \u00c01 . Serum protein concentrations in calves are also highly correlated with the concentration of immunoglobulins in blood and can be used to determine adequate transfer of passive immunity. A hand-held refractometer can be used to measure serum protein; levels greater than 5.0 g 100 ml \u00c01 by 24 h of age indicate adequate consumption of colostrum. The use of colostrum substitutes and replacers may help improve disease resistance in calves when high-quality colostrum is not available.",

For rotavirus and coronavirus, the most effective prevention is vaccination of the dam to increase antibodies in the colostrum against these organisms. Other organisms, such as E. coli and Salmonella sp., may be resistant to many of the commonly used antibiotics. Producers often give antibiotics to calves during episodes of diarrhoea in order to prevent secondary infections; however, this practice often does more damage than good, killing bene\u00aecial gut micro\u00afora and damaging the gut lining.

Open-front housing for older heifers should also help prevent pneumonia. Adequate, draught-free ventilation is important for prevention of pneumonia. Hutches, pastures and open-front housing for replacements provide optimal ventilation. In addition, hutches can be moved from location to location, giving producers the opportunity easily to remove old bedding and to break disease cycles.

After weaning, calves should be housed in small groups of 10 or fewer until they have successfully made the transition from liquid feed to dry feed and the transition from individual housing to competing for food. Additionally, by housing in small groups (rather than mixing large groups of animals at one time), producers can limit the exposure of calves to disease organisms and match calves more closely by size. As calves age, they can be housed in increasingly larger groups; however, animals should be grouped so there is not more than 50 kg difference in size of animals up to 6 months and not more than 90 kg difference in size for older animals.",

In addition,\u00afies can transfer diseases from older to younger animals. Producers must determine whether to have a closed herd or to allow introduction of new animals to the farm. If new animals are brought to a farm, the producer should work closely with a veterinary surgeon to determine which vaccinations animals should receive prior to coming to the farm. Once new animals arrive on the farm, or animals return to the farm from contractgrowers or exhibitions, they should be quarantined for at least 30 days. This will allow time to determine if the new animals are likely to become ill and to allow the new animals to be exposed more slowly to any disease organisms currently on the farm.",

Horn-\u00afies can be a major problem for cattle. They can cause substantial blood loss, transmit diseases including mastitis to replacements and decrease growth rates. Use of forced back rubs is probably the most effective method of decreasing populations of horn-\u00afies. Additionally, removal of manure, which is the major breeding habitat for horn-\u00afies, helps decrease populations. Another type of\u00afy, the stabley, breeds in wet feed. Severe infestations of stableies can cause up to a 50% decrease in milk production. Counts of 25\u00afies per animal cause economically important losses in milk production and growth. Removal of waste feed from under feed troughs and other areas to decrease breeding areas is the most important mechanism for control. Horseies and deer-\u00afies are also blood-sucking\u00afies and may be responsible for spread of several diseases but are impractical to control. Common house-\u00afies are not blood-sucking insects but feed on muzzles, eyes and open wounds. They can be contaminated with more than 30 viruses and 175 bacteria, as well as other disease-causing organisms. The main form of control for common house-\u00afies is sanitation and removal of breeding material because many house-\u00afies are resistant to insecticide sprays. Cattle grubs are another parasite common in North America. The main damage to cattle is caused by the migration of the grubs through host tissues and production of cysts on the animals' backs. Growth rates can be adversely affected with infestations of cattle grubs. Appropriate insecticide treatment will kill grubs; however, care must be taken not to administer insecticides when large numbers of grubs may have accumulated in the spinal canal. Killing of large numbers of grubs at once can lead to anaphylaxis in cattle. Other external parasites that may affect dairy cattle include\u00afeas, lice, ticks and mites.

In other words, the cost of a replacement heifer equals her purchase cost or value (if raised on the farm) plus the losses in milk yield (difference in the greater value of the milk from the cow and her replacement for what would be the remainder of the cull cow's lactation) minus the recovery value of the cull (sale price of a cull). As a result, the recovery value of the cull when sold is only about one-third to one-half the cost of purchasing her replacement.
