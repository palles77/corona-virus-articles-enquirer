Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is undermining this sense of security because it is proving both highly transmissible (like H1N1) and not too deadly (unlike Ebola). The result is a relatively easily transmitted virus with a case fatality rate currently estimated as well above that of the common influenza.",

Since erupting in China, it has claimed thousands of lives there, and has now spread globally, causing infections, death and growing alarm. The WHO's initial focus was on managing droplet and contact transmission, but it has since recognized the role fomites play as well. 2 Fomites are important because while populations generally protect themselves from clearly observable droplet transmissions (coughing, sneezing), being invisible, fomite transmission is regularly overlooked both in hospitals and communities. [3] [4] [5] Consequently, during the community saturation phase, fomite transmission may play a larger role than droplet transmission as a mechanism in emergent infectious diseases. [3] [4] [5] [6] In this paper we argue that by implementing enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB), 6 In the COVID-19 case, after a long incubation period, family clusters Recently, Taiwan's COVID-19 response was praised in public health circles. 12 Taiwan's success can be at least partially attributed to its success in breaking the community-hospital-community transmission cycle by implementing TCB with the enhancements identified here. We therefore strongly recommend implementing eTCB as an important tool for containing COVID-19.",

            "text": "related to Huanan market developed (Figure1, arrow 1). Early in the outbreak, much as with SARS, transmission via droplets and fomites began cycling between the local community and clinics and hospitals via waiting rooms crowded by both ill and healthy people (Figure 1, arrow 2). In this case, nosocomial spread began among both HCWs and visitors to the hospitals, who when returning home, re-infected their communities. (Figure 1, arrow 3) This process extended the transmission cycle in a positive feedback loop, amplifying the outbreak (Figure 1, arrows 4 &5) and cascading to the point of community saturation (Figure 1). 4In short, following a dynamic similar to earlier coronavirus outbreaks, COVID-19 spread from the Wuhan epicenter to nearby communities and outward within China and internationally. However, COVID-19 has some unique characteristics. These include asymptomatic infection; a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility; false negatives, and; an incubation period of up to 22 days.10,11 These characteristics necessitate enhancement to the TCB protocols to ensure effective transmission control.6 Enhanced TCB (eTCB) includes two enhancements to traditional TCB.First, where TCB has a contamination zone (Isolation ward) and a transition zone, eTCB expands the transition zone to incorporate a quarantine ward as well. The quarantine ward houses patients with atypical manifestations and patients awaiting final diagnosis. These patients are transferred to the quarantine ward directly from outdoor triage and are held there for the full incubation period. 6 (Figure 2) As with traditional TCB, the zones are separated by a transition zone with checkpoints for hand disinfection. HCWs moving from the clean zone to quarantine ward must first dress in PPE. When transitioning from the quarantine to the isolation ward, HCWs must engage in comprehensive checkpoint disinfection, a process repeated as they move from the isolation ward to the clean zone (again, via a transition zone). Second, to address community to hospital infection threats, checkpoint hand disinfection and face masks are required of all visitors entering the hospital. This is supplemented with heightened environmental cleaning and disinfection.COVID-19 droplet and fomite transmission has been observed both inside and outside of hospitals. By containing nosocomial transmissions, eTCB contributes to breaking the cycle of community-hospital-community infection.",

HCWs moving from contamination to clean zones must undertake decontamination and degowning in the transition zone, and hand disinfection at every checkpoint between the zones.During the Taiwan SARS outbreak, this strategy achieved 100% hand hygiene compliance among HCWs. When coupled with strict PPE use and standard infection control procedures, hospital fomite, contact and droplet transmissions were efficiently controlled. As a result, community SARS infection rates declined as well. Success was evidenced by no new diagnosed cases over two one-week incubation periods following TCB implementation.3,4 TCB is particularly effective as regards to the role of fomites. As noted, people in the same care zone. However, later analysis found that those without contact history with the index case were likely infected by fomites on bed curtains and/or public restroom fixtures touched by the index case who had",
