To understand how cells response in the early stage of virus-host cell interaction, in this study, a purified recombinant S protein was studied for stimulating murine macrophages (RAW264.7) to produce proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u2423) and chemokine IL-8. We found that direct induction of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 release in the supernatant in a dose-, time-dependent manner and highly spike protein-specific, but no induction of IL-8 was detected. Further experiments showed that IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 production were dependent on NF-B, which was activated through I-B\u2423 degradation. These results suggest that SARS-CoV spike protein may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS, especially in inflammation and high fever.",

Thus, cytokines storm has been proposed to be involved in the rapid course of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in SARS patients. The likelihood of SARS being an immune-mediated disease is supported by the observation of a transient lymphopenia, especially in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells early in the SARS episode, and elevated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in SARS patients (Li et al., 2003b; Wong et al., 2004a; Xie et al., 2003) .",

Under resting conditions, NF-B consists of a heterotrimer of p50, p65, and I-B in the cytoplasm, after activation by a large number of inducers, the I-B proteins become phosphorylated, ubiquitylated and, subsequently, degraded by the proteasome. The degradation of I-B allows NF-B proteins to translocate to the nucleus and bind their cognate DNA binding sites to regulate the transcription of a large number of genes, including antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, chemokines, stress-response proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins. I-B degradation is triggered by activation of a complex of multiple kinases that is composed of IKK\u2423 and IKK\u2424 and a structural regulatory subunit, IKK\u2425 or NEMO. Phosphorylation of IKK\u2423 and IKK\u2424 is activated by their upstream kinases including NF-B-inducing kinase (Ghosh et al., 1998; Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000; Li and Verma, 2002; Verma et al., 1995) .

IL-6 also plays multiple roles during subsequent development of acquired immunity against incoming pathogens, stimulation of antibody production by B cells, regulation of macrophage (M) and dendritic cell (DC) differentiation, and response of regulatory T cells to microbial infection. Up-regulation of IL-6 was induced by infection of many viruses, including MHV, HRV, HCMV (Banerjee et al., 2002; Gealy et al., 2005; Griego et al., 2000) . Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423) has multiple biologic effects including the enhanced release of other proinflammatory/chemotactic mediators, up-regulation of adhesion molecules, enhanced migration of eosinophils and neutrophils. TNF-\u2423 was detected in increased amounts in sera of patients with SARS (Zhang et al., 2004) . These data implicate TNF-\u2423 is a potent inflammatory cytokine in the pathogenesis of SARS.",

Many viruses and their membrane proteins can activate macrophages to produce cytokines. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) induced IL-6 and IL-8 in human monocytes . Hepatitis B virus Capsid strongly induced TNF-\u2423, IL-6 and IL-12p40 in THP-1 macrophages (Cooper et al., 2005) . SARS-CoV failed to productively infect human macrophages, but the interaction between SARS-CoV and human macrophage triggered the production of cytokine (IL-6, IL-12) efficiently (Tseng et al., 2005) . And the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and the chemokine IL-8 are strongly up-regulated in SARS patients (Hsueh et al., 2004) . Recombinant baculovirus displaying SARS-CoV spike protein induced IL-8 release . Then, we had the hypothesis that the spike protein plays an important role in the production of proinflammatory cytokine at the stage of virushost cell interaction. In the present study, we examined the ability of S protein of SARS to modulate the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u2423) and chemokine (IL-8) production. The murine macrophages cell line (RAW264.7) was incubated with a purified recombinant S protein, then the levels of IL-6, TNF-\u2423 and IL-8 in the supernatant were measured by ELISA. Our results showed that S protein induced massive release of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 in an S protein-specific, as well as time-and dosedependent manner. However, there was no induction of IL-8 was detected. Furthermore, we found that S protein activated NF-B signaling pathway via I-B\u2423 degradation, which was essential for up-regulation of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423.",

After exposing RAW264.7 cells to the purified S protein at a concentration ranging from 0 to 20 g/ml and at a time ranging from 0 to 24 h, the levels of IL-6, TNF-\u2423 and IL-8 in the culture supernatant of RAW264.7 cells were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Recombinant S protein induced the production of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 in the culture supernatant of RAW264.7 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner ( Fig. 2A-D) . Increasing concentrations of S protein resulted in release of increasing amounts of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 into the supernatant. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with about 5 g/ml S protein was sufficient for full induction of TNF-\u2423, and even 1 g/ml S protein significantly induced TNF-\u2423 production in RAW264.7 cells. IL-6 release was detectable at 6 h and sustained throughout the experiment (up to 24 h), and induction of TNF-\u2423 was observed as early as 3 h and increased further at 9 h to remain stable for up to 24 h of treatment. There was no up-regulation of IL-8 in RAW264.7 incubated with S protein, and it was not due to the problem of the IL-8 ELISA kit because of the positive control of IL-8 standard substance (data not shown). To further determine whether IL-6 induction occurred at the transcriptional level, IL-6 mRNA levels were evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR. S protein strongly induced the transcription level of IL-6 in a dose-dependence manner, which was consistent with the release of IL-6 in the supernatants (Fig. 2E) .

Previous reports have shown that live SARS-CoV induced a production of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 in human M and DC, importantly, the ability of SARS-CoV modulating M and DC functions was independent of viral replication Tseng et al., 2005) . The mechanism of SARS-CoV infection inducing the release of cytokines remains obscure. Since the S protein can bind to the receptor, we sought to investigate whether the S protein can interact with macrophages then up-regulate the release of cytokines/chemokines. In the current study, we found that incubation of RAW264.7 with truncated SARS-CoV S protein led to production of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 which were depended on NF-B activation. We expressed the truncated S protein incorporating amino acids 262-606 instead of the full-length spike protein in our study. As we all known, the full-length spike protein consists of S1 domain and S2 domain, and S1 domain is responsible for the attachment to the target cells (Li et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2004b) . So we tried to express the full-length S1 protein at the beginning, but it could not be expressed in BL21(DE3). The probably reason is that there is a large hydrophobic region in N-terminal peptidase domain, which is not necessary for the binding with receptor. Then we tried to express the truncated S1 protein reserving the receptorbinding domain (RBD) and lacking the hydrophobic region in BL21(DE3). Fortunately, the truncated protein was expressed at a very high level as inclusion bodies and it was sufficient for our study.",

            "text": "It has been demonstrated that viral infection triggered the NF-B pathway, resulting in transcription activation of a large number of proinflammatory genes, including cytokine and chemokines (Zhu et al., 1996) . To delineate the mechanisms of S protein inducing cytokine production, we first measured NF-B activation by luciferase assay in S protein-induced RAW264.7 increased 5-fold compare to the control. Activation of NF-B depends on degradation of I-B, which normally sequesters NF-B in the cytoplasm, inhibiting its function (Ghosh et al., 1998; Li and Verma, 2002; Verma et al., 1995) . To further investigate the involvement of the NF-B signaling pathways in S protein-induced cytokine regulation, we examined I-B\u2423 degradation in S protein-incubated cells by western blotting analysis. Consistent with our luciferase results, the level of I-B\u2423 in macrophages incubated with S protein was reduced at 1.5 h after incubation. We also found S protein induced IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 production through an NF-B-dependent mechanism in RAW264.7, because inhibition of NF-B activity caused inhibition of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 production. Mizutani et al. (2004) found that p38 MAPK was activated in SARS-CoV-infected cells (Vero E6), and SARS-CoV infection induced apoptotic cell death. Lee et al. (2004) showed that SARS patients had a higher intracellular phosphor-p38 level in total leukocytes than normal controls. Some studies have demonstrated p38 MAPK activation resulted in accumulation of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 mRNAs and an increase in production of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 (Banerjee et al., 2002; Eliopoulos et al., 1999; He et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005) . In our study, we did not examine the effects of S protein on activation of the p38 MAPK, but according to the above studies, it is possible that incubation RAW264.7 with S protein can also activate p38 MAPK pathway leading to the production of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423, future studies will address this issue.",

Although immune cells lack ACE2, SARS-CoV can infect human macrophages and dedritic cells Tseng et al., 2005; Yilla et al., 2005) without producing infectious virus particles, suggesting that SARS-CoV can entry the immune cells via other receptors. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a major class of molecular pattern recognition receptors, are activated by direct interaction of the extracellular domain of the receptor with a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, resulting in activation of NF-B, IRF3, and MAPK singaling pathways. TLR family is responsible for activation of innate immunity in response to various pathogens, including certain viruses (Boehme and Compton, 2004) . TLR2 interacts with viruses or their components, including measles virus, hepatitis C virus, and several herpesviruses, including cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Bieback et al., 2002; Compton et al., 2003; Dolganiuc et al., 2004; Kurt-Jones et al., 2004) . Activation of TLR2 by these viruses is followed by the production of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u2423. In future studies, we will examine whether TLRs participate in the induction of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 by SARS-CoV S protein. When S protein pre-treated with anti-S antibody and then incubated RAW264.7 cells, the cytokine induction reduced strongly. The result showed that anti-S antibody could block the interaction between S protein and the receptor in the immune cells resulting in reduced production of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423. Preboiled S protein cannot induce IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 efficiently. This result ruled out the possibility that contamination of endotoxin is responsible for cytokine induction. Because heat treatment for 1 h can destroy the functional structure of protein, thereby abolish the protein-induced activation effect on macrophages, while the similar heat treatment do not reduce the LPS-mediated stimulation (Cooper et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2001; Pathak et al., 2006) . And S protein-induced IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 release were not affected by Detoxi-GelTM Endotoxin Removing Gel treatment, further conforming the cytokines production were induced by S protein instead of endotoxin contamination.",
