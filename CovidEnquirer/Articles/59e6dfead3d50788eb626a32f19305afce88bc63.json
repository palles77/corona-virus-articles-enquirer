However, the potential pitfalls of using such databases for a secondary purpose, such as research, have been discussed and a general need for validation of such data has been identified (Bartlett et al., 1986; Lawrenson et al., 1999; Olsson et al., 2001) . Jordan et al. (2004) defined the completeness (epidemiologic sensitivity) of a secondary database as the proportion of cases that were actually recorded and the correctness (positive predictive value) as the proportion of cases reported that actually had the disease. In veterinary medicine, there are only a few examples where the correctness and/or completeness of a disease database have been evaluated. Examples are evaluations of the agreement between information in the computerized record and the paper files in a Canadian veterinary teaching hospital (Pollari et al., 1996a) and in Swedish insurance data (Egenvall et al., 1998; Nodtvedt et al., 2006; Penell et al., 2007) .",

It is based on veterinary reporting and all species of animals are included, although the emphasis is on production animals. In Sweden, and for dairy cattle, veterinarians are obliged to report disease events for which they have been consulted to the Swedish Board of Agriculture (SBA, 2000) . Further, drugs used in veterinary medicine for food animals need a prescription (NPA, 1997) and veterinarians are only allowed to prescribe after medical examination of the animal (SBA, 2006) . Consequently, the Swedish disease-recording system should cover all cases of disease in cattle where a veterinarian is consulted, including all cases where there is a need for prescribed drug treatment.",

The population is free from, or has a very low prevalence of, specific infections such as salmonellosis, paratuberculosis, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, enzootic bovine leucosis and bovine viral diarrhoea. During 2004, the mean herd size was 44 cows and the average milk yield per cow was 9177 kg ECM (energy-corrected milk). There were 7072 herds enrolled in the Swedish Official Milk Recording Scheme, including 86% of the 400,000 Swedish dairy cows. Our sampling frame was herds in the Swedish Official Milk Recording Scheme, with a herd size !25 dairy cows at the time of sampling. For example, to detect a loss of 20% at the official numbers of clinical mastitis (17 events per 100 lactations) with a power of 80% and 95% confidence level, a sample of 2060 cows was needed, without considering the farm-level variation (Win Episcope 2.0). Based on such sample calculations, practicality and expected participation (50%), a sample of 400 herds was randomly selected, i.e. we aimed at having approximately 8000 cows in the study. The random selection of herds was done by giving all herds that fulfilled the criteria a random number and the herds with the lowest 400 numbers were sampled.",

The study was a baseline recording of disease events in Swedish dairy herds during January (n = 177), April (n = 157), July (n = 153) and October (n = 152) 2004. Rates are given for all disease events and for veterinary-treated events only (herd outbreaks excluded). By diagnosis, cattle-years at risk ranged between 2929 and 2963 for cows and between 3857 and 3873 for young stock (for diagnoses where IRs were estimated). By diagnosis, the number of animals at risk ranged between 3518 and 9181 (for diagnoses where IPs were estimated).",

A questionnaire study involving large-animal practitioners in Sweden showed that the strategy for choosing diagnostic codes varies greatly among veterinarians, as does the opinion on the suitability of the codes available (M\u00f6 rk et al., 2005) . Consequently, there is a risk that some diseases appear under-reported due to the veterinarians' choice of diagnosis. There is also a risk that specific disease complexes or co-morbidities are underreported (Pollari et al., 1996b) . Failure of the veterinarian to report according to instructions is another reason for loss of data (Olsson et al., 2001 ). Between 2000 of the veterinary-treated disease events reported to the Swedish Board of Agriculture had invalid identities, and could therefore not be used within the Milk Recording Scheme. In March 2007, the situation had improved to being only 2-4% (personal communication, Katarina Roth, SDA). Further, there can be differences between veterinarians in the number of diagnoses/problems they choose to record for a given case, as discussed by Penell et al. (2007) . In our comparison, there would be a loss of events if the veterinarian included relatively fewer events than the farmer.",

A better estimate of the completeness would be to also include the events that were reported in the DDD but not reported by the farmers ((C + D)/(B + C + D) in Fig. 1) , which slightly improves the estimate to 73% (for numbers, see Table 3 ). To estimate the epidemiological sensitivity of the DDD we would need to use a method of analysis that could handle the lack of gold standard. However, at current such methods require that the tests used (in our case, data sources) are independentan assumption that is not applicable on our data.

As we mentioned earlier, such events are not included in the DDD. In the present study it was, as expected, found that the under-reporting was substantial for group-related events. Larger outbreaks are, in Sweden, often associated with viral pathogens such as bovine coronavirus or bovine respiratory syncytial virus. Consequently, such infections are likely to be under-reported in the DDD just because they occur as large outbreaks. In addition, we also expected them to be under-reported because they are typically mild (not requiring veterinary treatment) and occur in younger animals. We think that these factors together are the reason for the large difference in IR between the databases for the diagnoses cough and gastro-intestinal disorders. The significant difference between the databases remained for cough and gastro-intestinal disorders in young stock and for gastro-intestinal disorders in cows when the outbreaks were excluded, indicating additional under-reporting due to absence of veterinary contact. However, the difference also remained (for young stock) when only veterinarytreated events were included in the estimation (indicating that there were also under-reporting by veterinarians).",

Some studies where farmer participation has been a crucial part have used inclusion criteria aimed at eliminating poor reporters (Olsson et al., 1993; Ortman and Svensson, 2004) . We did not screen eligible farmers to exclude those that might report poorly. Reducing the risk of bias arising from poor reporting would increase the risk of bias arising from including only farmers that kept good records (and possibly also contacted a veterinarian to a higher or lesser degree).
