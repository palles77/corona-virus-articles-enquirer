            "text": "Viruses in the family Coronaviridae have elicited new interest, with the outbreaks caused by SARS-HCoV in 2003 and the recent discovery of a new human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63. The genus Torovirus, within the family Coronaviridae, is less well characterized, in part because toroviruses cannot yet be grown in cell culture (except for the Berne virus). In this study, we determined the sequence of the complete genome of Breda-1 (BoTV-1), a bovine torovirus. This is the first complete torovirus genome sequence to be reported. BoTV-1 RNA was amplified using long RT-PCR and the amplicons sequenced. The genome has a length of 28.475 kb and consisted mainly of the replicase gene (\u223c20.2 kb) which contains two large overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, respectively. Sequence analysis identified conserved domains within the predicted sequences of pp1a and pp1b. Sequence alignments and protein secondary structure prediction data suggest the presence of a 3C-like serine protease domain with similarity to the arterivirus 3C-like serine protease and a single papain-like cysteine protease domain with similarity to the picornavirus leader protease. The ADRP (APPR-1 ) domain -unique to the Coronaviridae -was also located in BoTV pp1a. In addition, several hydrophobic domains were identified that are typical of a nidovirus replicase. Within the pp1b sequence the polymerase and helicase domains were identified, as well as sequences predicted to be involved in ribosomal frameshifting, including the conserved slippery sequence UUUAAAC and two potential pseudoknot structures.",

Approximately 16 kb of sequence from the 3 end of the genome, and approximately 1.5 kb from the 5 end of genome have been determined. These sequence data have revealed the basic torovirus genome organization and the presence of conserved replicase domains (Snijder and Horzinek, 1993) . These findings were instrumental in the revision of the Coronaviridae taxon to include the genus Torovirus, as well as the creation of the order Nidovirales which currently includes the families Coronaviridae (comprising two genera, Coronavirus and Torovirus), Arteriviridae and Roniviridae (Cavanagh, 1997; Cavanagh et al., 1994; Cavanagh and Horzinek, 1993; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003) . The complete genome sequence of EqTV has yet to be published, although Smits et al. (2003) reported the completion of the EqTV genome sequence in a recent study of torovirus field variants. The published sequence of BoTV is limited to that of the structural genes, which account for approximately 7.5 kb of the 3 end of the genome (Cornelissen et al., 1997; Duckmanton et al., 1998a,b) . Consequently, the genus Torovirus remains the only genus within the order Nidovirales without a representative complete genome sequence.",

Primer names, sequences, and positions within the BoTV-1 genome are given in Table 1 . One primer, APPR-RS, was designed within a conserved region of the coronavirus open reading frame (ORF) 1a of the replicase gene. This region was first identified by ORF1a amino acid alignment, followed by the corresponding nucleotide alignment of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), GenBank accession no.

Alignments were done using ClustalX 1.8 (Thompson et al., 1997) . The sequence of the APPR-RS primer was based on the consensus sequence of the nucleotide alignment described above. The EEAT7 primer used in the amplification of the 3 non-coding region (3 NC) is a coxsackie virus B6 specific primer (Martino et al., 1999) . The complementary sequence of the first 21 nucleotides (3 -5 ) of this primer were incorporated into the BRE-3 NC-CVB6 primer used in the reverse transcription reaction. Lastly, the AAP-CVB6 primer used in the 5 RACE PCR reaction was designed to bind within the poly(A) of the cDNA transcripts, and contained sequence complementary to the 3 end of the EEAT7 primer, allowing for the option of using EEAT7 in a reamplification of 1st round PCR products.",

A stretch of seven thymidine residues (27, 721) , as opposed to eight in the previously reported sequence, is responsible for this difference. This resulted in a shift of the ORF leading to extension of the gene and protein sequence. The sequences of several BoTV isolates characterized by Smits et al. (2003) are in agreement with the length of the HE gene/protein sequence reported here. Of the six isolates sequenced within the structural genes, four of these had HE genes of 1260 nts, identical to what is reported here. The other two isolates contained HE genes shorter by only 3 nts, although the structural genes were identified as having undergone recombination with a porcine torovirus resulting in an HE gene of mixed origin (Smits et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "The putative replicase gene of BoTV-1 is comparable to the replicase gene of the coronaviruses in many aspects. Most obvious is its size, which at 20,201 nts in length is comparable to the coronavirus replicase genes with a range of 20-22 kb (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . The putative ORF1a of 13,338 nts and ORF1b of 6876 nts encode a ORF1a/1b fusion polyprotein (pp1a/1b) of 6733 aa. A nucleotide sequence comparison of ORF1b between BoTV-1 and EqTV, the latter having been reported previously (Snijder , 1990) , revealed a high degree of identity. At the nucleotide and amino acid level the two viruses display 83.8 and 91.0% identity, respectively. Therefore, it is not surprising that similar potential secondary structures were identified in the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap, and the same conserved domains of ORF1b identified in EqTV and other nidoviruses were also found in BoTV ORF1b (Snijder et al., 2003 (Snijder et al., , 1990 . The ORF1b protein product is believed to be translated via a ribosomal frameshifting event generating the pp1a/1b fusion polyprotein. The two elements required for efficient ribosomal frameshifting, a slippery sequence and a RNA pseudoknot (Brierley, 1995) , were demonstrated in EqTV (Snijder et al., 1990) . The heptanucleotide slippery sequence found in BoTV, UUUAAAC, (nts 14,148-14,190 ) is identical to the slippery sequence identified in EqTV and the coronaviruses (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Snijder et al., 1990) . Secondary structure prediction of the ORF1a/1b overlap region identified two potential RNA pseudoknot structures downstream of the slippery sequence (Fig. 3) . Not surprisingly, these two structures are very similar to those predicted for EqTV.",

This ORF encodes a protein of 4445 aa (pp1a), larger than the pp1a of the majority of the coronaviruses, with the sole exception of the 4470 aa MHV pp1a. The pp1a of the nidoviruses also contain conserved domains with functions important to viral replication. All nidoviruses studied to date contain at least one protease domain within pp1a, Fig. 3 . Predicted pseudoknot structures in the BoTV-1 ORF1a/1b overlap region. A and B represent the two structures predicted using MFOLD software in the analysis of the ORF1a/1b overlap region. Loop 1,2 and stem 1,2 in (A) and (B) refer to structural features of the depicted pseudoknots. Note that the two structures have identical hairpin loops, but differ in the region downstream of the hairpin which folds back to bind to the loop of the hairpin structure, i.e., B has a larger loop 2 and a different stem 2 of the pseudoknot. Also note that loop 2 in B has the potential to form an internal secondary structure. C and D are schematic representations of A and B, respectively. The 5 and 3 orientations are given in each figure. The ORF1a stop codon is underlined in A and B, and the slippery sequence, UUUAAAC, is boxed in all four figures. The dashed line in B indicates that the \"C\" residue can potentially bind to either of the G residues, or both. A and C show BoTV-1 nucleotides 14,184-14,255; B and D show nucleotides 14,184-14,305 . (Snijder et al., 2003) . known as the 'main' protease or 3C-like protease (3CLP), after the picornaviruses 3C protease, and located within the C terminus of the pp1a protein (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . Although all of the nidoviruses possess this domain, the protease is slightly different in each family. The coronavirus 3CLP contains a cysteine as its catalytic nucleophile, but does not appear to contain an acidic residue common to the catalytic triad, His-Asp(Glu)-Cys, found in this family of proteases (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . The 3CLP of the gill associated virus (GAV), genus Oakavirus, family Roniviridae, is also a cysteine protease and like the coronavirus 3CLP, possesses a Cys-His catalytic dyad . Finally, the arterivirus main protease is referred to as a 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP) due to the presence of a serine nucleophile in the triad His-Asp-Ser, more common in the cellular homologues, such as the pancreatic enzyme chymotrypsin (Snijder et al., 1996) . It was, therefore, surprising to find that the main protease of BoTV appears to be a serine protease, similar to the arterivirus 3CLSP. Repeated attempts at aligning the BoTV sequence with the coronavirus 3C protease failed to provide a convincing alignment. The results presented here were obtained with supporting data from PSI BLAST analysis, the protein sequence alignment shown in Fig. 5A , and secondary structure prediction analysis using the 3D-PSSM protein fold recognition (threading) server that identified the BoTV main protease sequence reported here as having trypsin-like or chymotrypsin-like protease folds.",

The limited BoTV sequence available for primer design posed a challenge, which was overcome by the use of available sequence from related viruses such as EqTV and the coronaviruses. Using this approach almost 21 kb of novel BoTV-1 sequence was obtained without the benefit of cultured virus. With the availability of the complete genome sequence of BoTV-1, and with more than half of the EqTV genome sequence reported, future studies involving the molecular characterization of other toroviruses should be greatly facilitated. For example, the identification and characterization of the human coronavirus responsible for the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was successful, in part, due to the use of RT-PCR assays targeting conserved domains within ORF1b of the viral replicase gene (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003) .",

Although a PLP motif with similarity to the coronavirus PL2 pro domain was identified, sequence alignment and protein structure prediction analysis support the hypothesis that the BoTV PLP is more similar to the leader protease (L pro ) of the picornaviruses FMDV and ERAV. The coronavirus PL2 pro is the largest protease in this family of enzymes due to a unique zinc finger structure that connects the N-terminal alpha-helical domain to the C-terminal betasheet domain of the protease (Herold et al., 1999) In contrast, the N-and C-terminal domains of the picornavirus protease are joined by a short beta-strand structure (Guarne et al., 1998) , which may also be the case for the torovirus protease given the size similarity.",

Taking advantage of the BoTV sequence in this study, a new alignment of the RdRp protein sequences was done (data not shown) and the dendrogram obtained was highly similar to that obtained by Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003) but showing the two toroviruses, EqTV and BoTV, clustering together. However, the exact boundaries of the RdRp domains were difficult to establish for many sequences used in the alignment. The availability of the first complete torovirus sequence enabled the establishment of CVTRees with representatives from of all genera within Nidovirales (Fig. 6 ). The topology of the trees shows that whereas the coronaviruses and the arteriviruses form distinct clusters, in both trees the BoTV-1 sequence stands apart from these clusters. Presently, Coronavirus and Torovirus are two genera within the family Coronaviridae. Viral taxonomy currently uses a polythetic approach which considers numerous properties simultaneously (Condit, 2001) . Based on their phylogenetic analysis, Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003) proposed that the differences between coronaviruses and toroviruses are large enough that the two genera be elevated to subfamilies or even to families within Nidovirales. The data presented here support further taxonomic separation between the genera Coronavirus and Torovirus.",
