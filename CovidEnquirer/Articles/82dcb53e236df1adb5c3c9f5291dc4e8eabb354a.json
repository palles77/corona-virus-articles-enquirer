            "text": "Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the most lethal diseases encountered in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The etiological pathogens and prognostic factors of severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children with respiratory virus infections were prospectively investigated. Methods: Enrolled children fulfilled the following criteria: (1) PICU admission; (2) age of 1 month to 16 years; (3) diagnosis of infectious pneumonia and respiratory virus infection; and (4) development of severe ARDS within 72 h after PICU admission. Pathogens were detected in the blood and tracheal lavage fluid using molecular techniques and a conventional culture system. The serum levels of inflammatory mediators on the day of PICU admission were examined. Results: Fifty-seven patients (32 boys; median age, 9 months) were enrolled. Multiple virus infections, co-infection with bacteria/fungus, and bacteremia/fungemia were observed in 60%, 49%, and 32% of children, respectively. Adenovirus-B, measles virus, and cytomegalovirus were detected predominantly in tracheal lavage fluid. There were no statistically significant differences between non-survivors and survivors regarding the types of pathogen, incidence of multiple virus infection, gender, age, clinical features, and treatment. The serum levels of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and the IFN-\u03b3/interleukin (IL)-10 ratio were higher in non-survivors. Conclusions: IFN-\u03b3 upregulation as detected on the day of PICU admission was found to be one of the possible prognostic factors affecting a fatal outcome. These results suggest that modulation of inflammatory responses is critical for the clinical management of children with ARDS.",

The higher IL-6/IL-10 ratio on the day of PICU admission was thought to reflect measles-specific inflammatory responses. 34 The present study had some limitations. First, our sample size was small.

The duration from the onset of illness to PICU admission and serum IFN-\u03b3 level on the day of PICU admission were associated with fatal outcome(Table 5B). We also calculated the AUC of the ROC curve for the serum IFN-\u03b3 level. The result was 0.778 (95%CI: 0.656-0.899), indicating that IFN-\u03b3 predicts a fatal outcome with moderate accuracy. Taken together, serum IFN-\u03b3 level on the day of PICU admission is a potential predictor of fatal outcome.4 | DISCUSSION The acute onset of ARDS is one of the most lethal clinical courses of any infectious respiratory diseases. In the present study, we focused on severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children with respiratory virus infection. Inflammatory responses in severe ARDS developed from viral pneumonia are thought to be related to both primary respiratory infection and systemic inflammatory responses. In this study, we prospectively examined the infectious pathogens and host inflammatory response by measuring the serum levels of cytokines, chemokines, and HMGB-1 on the day of PICU admission.For the etiologies of severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children, we found that at least one viral genome was detected in TLFs from nearly all (60 of 61) children. This result is consistent with those of several reports revealing respiratory viruses as the major causative pathogens in children hospitalized with acute respiratory infection.33 A high frequency of multiple virus infections (60%) and bacterial/fungal co-infection (44%) was observed in enrolled children. Recently, it has become possible to detect multiple virus genomes simultaneously, with high sensitivity using molecular detection techniques, such as multiplex-PCR. Therefore, we can now detect more virus genomes than was previously possible. This",

Measles-associated immunosuppression may have resulted in increased susceptibility to other virus infections and increased frequency of multiple virus infection. 34 Among the 57 enrolled children, 30 children were admitted during the measles outbreak, and 18 of 30 (60%) children were MeV-positive. The detection frequency of MeV during the outbreak was significantly higher than after the outbreak (June 2014 to May 2015).

Children who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria were enrolled: (1) admission to the PICU with infectious pneumonia; 20 (2) age of 1 month to 16 years; and (3) complicated with severe ARDS with a P/F ratio of \u2264100 mm Hg with a PEEP \u22655 cm H 2 O (based on Berlin definition of 2012), 7 performance of at least one arterial-blood gas analysis within 72 h after PICU admission, and presence of new bilateral infiltration on chest radiography. We excluded children who had bronco-pulmonary dysplasia, chronic lung disease, or right to left shunting congenital heart diseases. Notably, a measles outbreak occurred among Vietnamese children during the first half of the year of the study period. 21,22 2.2 | Microbiological studies Blood and tracheal lavage fluid (TLF) samples were collected on the day of PICU admission. One to two milliliters of TLF was recovered after adding 2 mL sterile saline into the patient's intubation tube. Blood and/or TLF culture were performed to detect bacteria and fungi. To detect and differentiate up to 25 pathogenic microbial DNAs in blood samples, the LightCycler SeptiFast Test (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Manheim, Germany) was used. 23 2.3 | xTAG\u00ae respiratory virus panel (RVP) Fast v2 assay Total nucleic acids from TLF samples were extracted using a Roche MagNA Pure LC instrument with a MagNA Pure LC total nucleic acid isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics).
