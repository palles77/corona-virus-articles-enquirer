            "text": "P arainfluenza viruses (PIVs) are a known cause of respiratory illness in children and contribute substantially to ambulatory care visits and hospitalizations in the United States, with rates of hospitalization estimated at 1.02 per 1000 among children aged <5 years. 1 The 4 distinct types of PIV are associated with specific clinical presentations, causing a spectrum of respiratory illness. PIVs 1 and 2 are the leading cause of croup in young children, and PIV1 is isolated in most cases of croup. Infection with PIV3, often considered the most clinically severe of the PIVs, can lead to lower respiratory tract disease, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. [2] [3] [4] [5] Together, PIVs are second only to respiratory syncytial virus as a cause of hospitalization for respiratory tract illness (RTI) in young children. 6 Outpatient and community studies have demonstrated the considerable impact of PIVs on pediatric respiratory disease outside the hospital setting; however, little has been published since the widespread use of more sensitive molecular laboratory methods. Studies published in the 1990s demonstrated that PIVs were responsible for 64%-65% of croup, 18%-45% of viral upper RTI and 22%-38% of viral lower RTI in children, 2, 7 and most children will experience infection with each PIV type by the time they reach 5 years of age. 8 Despite the substantial contribution of PIVs to respiratory illness, to date, there has been no systematic domestic surveillance to ascertain the population-based burden among pediatric outpatients.",

Annual spring epidemics of PIV3 were observed, but PIV3 circulation was significantly reduced during odd years of elevated PIV1 circulation. Prior studies have attributed this inverse pattern of activity to viral interference and cross-protection of PIV1 and PIV3 antibodies, producing consistent PIV seasonality. 3, 5, 7, 12, 13 Patterns of PIV2 circulation were varied, and we were unable to identify any season onset during 2013-2014. Seasonality findings for PIV2 have varied over the last half century and include reports of annual, biannual or biennial seasonality in either even or odd years, or irregular activity, 1,3,6,14-17 and may be explained by evolving seasonality, regional variability, difficulties in virus isolation or sample size limitations. 2, 7, 12, 18, 19 Consistent with previous studies, PIV4 was too infrequently detected to identify any circulation patterns or associated epidemiologic trends, but comprised 5% of all PIV detections. 12, 14 PIVs contribute substantially to the burden of medically attended ILI in children, accounting for 9% of ILI-related pediatric outpatient visits and 12% among children aged <5 years. Comparable estimates from 2 recent studies were found, 20,21 though our estimates were higher than many other estimates of non-hospitalized PIV which used more broadly defined case definitions, less sensitive testing methods or included adults. 2, 8, 13 Corresponding cumulative incidence estimates from IISP suggest that PIVs are detected among pediatric outpatients aged <5 years at a rate of 259-1307 visits per 100,000 children, compared with estimates of 180-2740 per 100,000 children for influenza virus. 9, 10 . Trends in the detection of PIV among pediatric outpatients are consistent with previous estimates among children with acute respiratory and/or febrile illnesses 7 ; however, population-based rates of PIV outpatient visits among children are unique to IISP.",

Although cough is reported consistently in PIV cases, 24 the presence of fever among PIV-positive patients presenting with symptoms of RTI varies widely in the literature, with estimates between 33% and 80%. 2, 5, 22 The difference in fever presentation across PIV studies may be attributable to differences in study populations, but most analyses assess clinical diagnoses rather than symptomatology.",

The IISP reflects ILI in the outpatient setting; thus, our analysis does not capture PIV patients with non-ILI presentation. However, we found that among a limited number of sites conducting surveillance including all ARI patients, 79% of the PIV-positive patients reported ILI symptoms within the 7 days before the clinical visit. As a more sensitive case definition, we expect that surveillance of ARI patients would have produced greater numbers of PIV cases than ILI surveillance; however because of decreased specificity, the percent positivity of PIV among ARI patients would be lower than among ILI patients. Surveillance for PIVs was reduced in the 2013-2014 surveillance year from 12 to 5 participating health departments, leading to decreased PIV detections for that year; although PIV data from 2013 to 2014 was consistent with previous surveillance years, the analysis may have been subject to bias related to decreased specimen collection and testing. Finally, although all sites used sensitive and specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays for PIV detection, small differences between the assays may have resulted in minor differences in PIV detection.",

Although PIVs are the leading cause of croup and contribute substantially to rates of upper and lower respiratory tract disease among children, there are currently no available antivirals or vaccines to treat PIV infection. Because PIV infections may be clinically indistinguishable from other ILI etiologies, it is important that surveillance be conducted to provide a resource to inform clinicians of viral circulation. We demonstrated the consistent seasonality and high-risk age groups which may help outpatient providers to better identify the etiology of PIV-related illness. Furthermore, population-based estimates of the incidence of PIV-associated outpatient ILI visits improve our understanding of the circulation and burden of PIV and support efforts for the prevention and treatment of infections, including the development of a PIV vaccine for very young children.",
