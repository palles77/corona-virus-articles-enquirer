As a key enzyme in the viral life-cycle, the main protease (M pro ) is most attractive for drug design targeting the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. In this study, SARS-CoV M pro was used to specifically remove the GST tag in a new fusion protein expression system. We report a new method to produce wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV M pro with authentic N and C termini, and compare the activity of WT protease with those of three different types of SARS-CoV M pro with additional residues at the N or C terminus. Our results show that additional residues at the N terminus, but not at the C terminus, of M pro are detrimental to enzyme activity. To explain this, the crystal structures of WT SARS-CoV M pro and its complex with a Michael acceptor inhibitor were determined to 1.6 \u00c5 and 1.95 \u00c5 resolution respectively. These crystal structures reveal that the first residue of this protease is important for sustaining the substrate-binding pocket and inhibitor binding. This study suggests that SARS-CoV M pro could serve as a new tag-cleavage endopeptidase for protein overproduction, and the WT SARS-CoV M pro is more appropriate for mechanistic characterization and inhibitor design.",

Especially for protein structure studies, one of the main bottlenecks is to produce adequate quantities of soluble and properly folded recombinant proteins. 1 Fusion protein expression systems have been widely used for this purpose in basic research and in industry. Fusion domains (or small \"tags\") are expressed as partners of the passenger proteins and are generally removed after purification, as they might interfere with the function or other biochemical or biophysical characteristics of the protein. 2 Hence, some endopeptidases, such as bovine thrombin, bovine Factor Xa, human rhinovirus 3C protease and tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, are routinely used to remove fusion domains. Of these, the viral proteases, e.g. human rhinovirus 3C protease 3, 4 and TEV protease, 5, 6 have proven to be the most selective and useful to date. Therefore, the development of novel viral \u2020 X.X. and H.Y. made equal contributions to this work.

[7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The coronavirus main protease (M pro ), which plays a key role in mediating viral replication and transcription, has been identified as the most attractive target for anti-SARS drug design. [12] [13] [14] In 2003, our group published the first crystal structure of SARS-CoV M pro . 14 Thereafter, several other groups published the structures of M pro , [15] [16] [17] and its complex with an aza-peptide epoxide inhibitor. 18 The M pro can form a homodimer both in the crystal 14, 17, 18 and in solution. 19, 20 Each protomer consists of three domains: domains I and II resemble chymotrypsin, whereas domain III has a globular cluster of five, mostly antiparallel, \u03b1helices. SARS-CoV M pro has a catalytic dyad consisting of His41 and Cys145, and its substrate-binding pocket is located in the cleft between domains I and II. The N-terminal residues 1-7 of domain I (or N-finger) of M pro are considered to have an important role in its proteolytic activity, 14, [21] [22] [23] although their importance in dimerization has been reported with inconsistent results. [21] [22] [23] In particular, mutation of Arg4, which is involved in forming an ion pair, results in a fourfold decrease in activity. 21 Deletion of the N-terminal residues 1-7 results in an almost completely inactive SARS-CoV M pro . 23 SARS-CoV M pro has been characterized sufficiently and two particular aspects drew our attention. First, it is highly selective for substrate sequence. 24 Second, it displays a high level of proteolytic activity, although inconsistent kinetic parameters have been reported for SARS-CoV M pro with k cat /K m ranging from 20-29,000 M \u22121 s \u22121 . 19, 20, [25] [26] [27] These properties indicate that SARS-CoV M pro is a promising candidate as an endopeptidase to remove fusion tags.",

First, the four amino acids AVLQ, which correspond to the P4-P1 sites of the N-terminal autocleavage sequence of SARS-CoV M pro , were introduced between the GST tag and the first residue of the protease. Thus, the authentic N terminus would become available by autocleavage during protein expression. Second, the eight amino acids GPHHHHHH (abbreviated as GPH 6 , where GP correspond to the P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 sites of rhinovirus 3C protease; see Table 1 ) were added after the last glutamine residue at the C terminus (Figure 1(c) ). This strategy was intended to yield an authentic C terminus following cleavage by rhinovirus 3C protease, despite appearing unreasonable, since SARS-CoV and rhinovirus belong to different families (Coronaviridae and Picornaviridae, respectively). This strategy was used for the following reasons.",

It shows that the five sites are identical for the two proteases, with the exception of P2\u2032. The substantial difference embodied in the two substrate sequences is limited to P2\u2032. Hence, we reasoned that rhinovirus 3C protease could recognize the octapeptide substrate SGVTFQ\u2193GP, whose P1-P6 sites were derived from the C-terminal autoprocessing site of SARS-CoV M pro . However, replacing lysine with proline at the P2\u2032 site would arrest autocleavage.

SDS-PAGE analysis (see Figure 1 (d)) showed that after Ni-affinity chromatography, the SARS-CoV M pro is in the WT-GPH 6 form, implying that the Nterminal GST tag was removed efficiently by autocleavage during protein expression in Escherichia coli. The difference between lane 4 and lane 5 indicates that the GPH 6 tag was indeed removed by rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage, confirming that the modified substrate of SARS-CoV M pro could be recognized by rhinovirus 3C protease. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization timeof-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis indicated that WT-GPH 6 and WT M pro s were in accord with their predicted molecular mass (see Table 2 ).",

The catalytic efficiency of an enzyme is best defined by k cat /K m . 34 Table 3 shows that the WT protease has the highest cleavage efficiency (k cat /K m = 26,500 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) while GPLGS-WT has the lowest (k cat /K m = 167 M \u22121 s \u22121 ).

Furthermore, our results suggest that increasing the number of additional residues at the N terminus would result in a greater decrease in activity.

Within the dimer, protomer A was in the active form, while protomer B showed an inactive form, resulting from a partially collapsed S1 subsite. 14 In contrast, the crystal of WT SARS-CoV M pro belongs to space group C2, and each asymmetric unit contains only one protomer of a typical dimer (with the two protomers designated A* and B*). The two protomers in the dimer are related by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis, and each has a catalytically competent conformation. All residues of the protomer (residues 1-306) were identified from electron density maps. Apart from differences in the S1 subsite, the SARS-CoV M pro protomer as seen in the new structure is very similar to each member of the dimer in the original structure (see Figure 2 ). Compared to the latter structure, the protomer in the new crystal forms display overall rmsd for C \u03b1 atoms of 0.6 \u00c5 for protomer A and 0.7 \u00c5 for protomer B.

In the S1 site of protomer A in our original structure (GPLGS-WT), the NH group of SerB1 was unable to donate hydrogen bonds simultaneously to the carboxylate group of GluA166 and the main-chain carbonyl group of PheA140, due to the presence of additional residues at the N terminus, although the distance is suitable for hydrogen bond formation. However, in the newly solved WT structure, the amino group (NH 2 ) of SerB*1 in one protomer donates a 3.0 \u00c5 hydrogen bond to the carboxylate group of GluA*166 (Figure 3(a) ) and a 2.7 \u00c5 hydrogen bond to the main-chain carbonyl group of PheA*140, thus stabilizing the S1 pocket. This induces a series of conformational changes. For instance, the NH of GlyA*143, which participates directly in the formation of the oxyanion hole, moves by 0.8 \u00c5 towards the active site; the main chain of residues 142-143 moves towards the S1 subsite; and the side-chain of AsnA*142 flips over with a 6 \u00c5 shift. Stabilized by SerB*1, protomer A* displays a more catalytically competent conformation in the S1 subsite than protomer A in our original structure. In our original structure, the S1 pocket of protomer B is partly collapsed compared with the WT protomer: no electron density was visible for residues A1 and A2; GluB166 reorientates to interact with the possibly protonated HisB163; PheB140 undergoes a dramatic conformational change, with the phenyl ring moving by as much as 10 \u00c5; and GlyB143 moves about 3 \u00c5 towards the active site, Figure 3 .

The NH of Gly143 moves 0.8 \u00c5 toward the activity site; the main chain of residues 142-143 moves toward the S1 subsite; the side-chain of Asn-A*142 flips over with a 6 \u00c5 shift compared with protomer A of GPLGS-WT.

These structural variations account for the higher activity of the WT protease compared with the GPLGS-WT and GS-WT proteases. We observed also that the GPLGS-WT protease has lower activity than the GS-WT protease. This might result from the additional flexible residues at the N terminus, which are located close to the active site and would hinder substrate binding.",

K i and k 3 represent the equilibrium binding constant and inactivation rate constant for covalent bond formation, respectively. 12 We assayed the inhibition of N3 against different types of M pro s to determine whether or not the additional residues would affect inhibitor binding. In our preliminary inhibition assays, we observed that N3 could completely inactivate WT and WT-GPH 6 proteases after its preincubation with the proteases (fivefold molar excess of the enzyme) for 5 min, but not GPLGS-WT and GS-WT proteases (see Supplementary Data Figure S2 ). The strict kinetic parameters listed in Table 4 show that the second-order rate constant of N3 against WT protease (k 3 /K i = 18,800 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) is approximately equal to that against WT-GPH 6 (k 3 /K i = 15,400 M \u22121 s \u22121 ).

The substantial difference between the structures of the WT complex and the GPLGS-WT complex reported previously 12 still lies in the S1 subsite. In the GPLGS-WT complex structure, N3 binds to protomers A and B of SARS-CoV M pro in an identical and normal manner, 12 thus we discuss only protomer A and A*. In protomer A of GPLGS-WT M pro complexed with N3, the NH group of SerB1 was 3.4 \u00c5 from the carboxylate group of GluA166 and 4.7 \u00c5 from the main-chain carbonyl group of PheA140, both of which are beyond the distance for formation of a hydrogen bond. However, an ordered water molecule is situated at the bottom of the S1 subsite, connecting N3 and the protease. This water donates two hydrogen bonds, to the carboxylate group of GluA166 and the main-chain carbonyl group of PheA140, and accepts two hydrogen bonds from the lactam and the sidechain of HisA172. Although the water molecule helps to stabilize the inhibitor binding in the S1 pocket, it occupies part of the space of the S1 subsite. Due to steric hindrance, the lactam was not able to insert further into the S1 subsite. In protomer A* of the WT M pro complexed with N3, no water molecule was found at the bottom of the S1 pocket. As a consequence, the carboxylate group of GluA*166 moves 1.7 \u00c5 upwards to form a 2.8 \u00c5 hydrogen bond with the NH of the lactam. The competent conformation of the S1 subsite is still maintained via the interaction of NH 2 SerB*1 with the carboxylate group of GluA*166 (Figure 4(b) ) and the main-chain carbonyl group of PheA*140. These structural data demonstrate that the first Ser1 residue is important also for inhibitor binding, and accounts for the more potent inhibition of N3 against the WT than the GPLGS-WT and GS-WT proteases.",

In this study, SARS-CoV M pro was engineered to serve as a novel endopeptidase to remove fusion tags in recombinant protein overproduction. Table 5 shows the advantages of SARS-CoV M pro compared with other routinely used proteases in methods for production, substrate specificity and cleavage efficiency. Human thrombin and bovine factor Xa are both extracted from plasma, which requires more complicated procedures, although they possess a high level of cleavage efficiency. In addition, they are not as selective for substrate as viral proteases. WT SARS-CoV M pro , which can be suitably overexpressed in E. coli, is highly specific for substrate. Furthermore, it has superior activity (k cat /K m = 26500 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) to rhinovirus and TEV proteases. Therefore, SARS-CoV M pro is a suitable candidate for site-specific cleavage in fusion protein expression systems. The cleavage efficiency of WT-GPH 6 is still high, despite additional residues at the C terminus. Highly purified M pro in this form could be obtained by a simple one-step purification, as shown by the overloaded SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 1(d) ) For the sake of an additional six histidine residues at the C terminus, it can be readily separated from the protein of interest by affinity chromatography after removal of the fusion tags. These advantages suggest this form of SARS-CoV M pro could have important industrial applications.",

As for point (3), the affinity GST tag was a mimic of the transmembrane domain upstream of SARS-CoV M pro in polyprotein 1a and 1ab, representing an autocleavage model of the M pro in vitro. SDS-PAGE analysis shows that the GST tag was removed entirely from the N terminus through autoprocessing during expression of SARS-CoV M pro in E. coli, exhibiting its high efficiency for autocleavage in vitro. In previous studies, it was hypothesized that the autocleavage of M pro may occur in proximity to the membrane. 13 Our data suggest that completion of autocleavage might be achieved in the cytoplasm, although the precise whereabouts of the assembly of replicase complex components remains to be identified. According to separate reports by Hsu and Lin, 35,36 using autocleavage to remove tags such as thioredoxin can further support our hypothesis. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses belong to the Picornaviridae and the Coronaviridae, respectively.",

The critical interactions involved in stabilizing the substrate-binding pocket are two hydrogen bonds formed by the free amino group of the first residue of one protomer with two residues, Phe140 and Glu166, comprising the S1 subsite of its partner protomer within the dimer structure. The stabilizing effect of the free amino group is obvious. In our published GPLGS-WT structure, the S1 subsite of protomer B is partially collapsed without stabilization by the first residue of protomer A, suggesting that the S1 pocket would be less stable due to micro-environmental changes. During the crystallization step of the structure determination procedure, a large quantity of WT SARS-CoV M pro crystals could be produced over one night, which could easily diffract to very high resolution under the conditions described previously. In contrast, it usually took five to ten days to produce a very limited amount of GPLGS-WT SARS-CoV M pro or GS-WT SARS-CoV M pro crystals suitable for diffraction, albeit with comparatively lower resolution. As a consequence, the WT SARS-CoV M pro reported here will be more suitable for activity assays, inhibitor screening and crystallization. It should accelerate development of anti-coronavirus inhibitors through a structure-assisted approach to drug design.",
