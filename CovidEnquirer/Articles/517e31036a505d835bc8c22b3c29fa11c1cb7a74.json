To characterize the susceptibility of other human and animal cells to IBV, 15 human and animal cell lines were infected with the Vero-adapted IBV and productive infection was observed in four human cell lines: H1299, HepG2, Hep3B and Huh7. In other cell lines, the virus cannot be propagated beyond passage 5. Interestingly, cellular furin abundance in five human cell lines was shown to be strongly correlated with productive IBV infection. Cleavage of IBV spike protein by furin may contribute to the productive IBV infection in these cells. The findings that IBV could productively infect multiple human and animal cells of diverse tissue and organ origins would provide a useful system for studying the pathogenesis of coronavirus.",

            "text": "In a recent study, furin was shown to be responsible for proteolytic activation of S protein at a novel RRRR 690 /S motif in the S2 region ). This cellular proprotein convertase is a calcium-dependent serine protease that circulates between trans-Golgi network (TGN), plasma membrane, and early endosome by association with exocytic and endocytic pathways (Bosshart et al., 1994; Molloy et al., 1994) . It cleaves a wide variety of protein precursors after the C-terminal arginine (R) residue in the preferred consensus motif (RXR(K)R/R (K, lysine; X, any amino acid). Introduction of mutations into the RRRR 690 /S motif and use of specific furin inhibitors demonstrated that furin may play an important role in furin-dependent entry, cell-cell fusion and infectivity of IBV in cultured cells . Similar observations were also reported by Belouzard et al. (2009) . Coronaviruses generally have a limited host range. However, recent evidence showed that several coronaviruses could break the host barrier and become zoonotic. For example, the novel SARS-CoV was found to cross host species from animal to human (Guan et al., 2003) . HCoV-OC43 could infect cells from a large number of mammalian species, although the virus was propagated exclusively in suckling mouse brains (Butler et al., 2006) . To study the mechanisms underlying the host cell specificity and susceptibility to coronavirus and coronavirus-host interactions, the Beaudette strain of IBV was adapted from chicken embryo to a monkey kidney cell line, Vero, by continuous propagation for 65 passages (Shen et al., 2003 (Shen et al., , 2004 . This adaptation was accompanied by mutations in the spike (S) protein (Fang et al., 2005 (Fang et al., , 2007 . In this study, infection of 15 cell lines of different species and tissue origins with the Vero cell-adapted IBV shows that four out of the 15 cell lines were able to support continuous and productive IBV infection with high efficiency. Meanwhile, strong correction between cellular furin abundance and productive IBV infection was found in five human cell lines infected with IBV.",

Consistent with the weak productive infection observed during continuous passages of IBV in HCT116 cells, the accumulation of S and N proteins was much slower in this cell line over the time-course, compared to that in the other cell lines (Fig. 2b) . It was also noted that the patterns of S protein cleavage and processing were slightly different from cell line to cell line (Fig. 2b ).

In a previous study, a novel furin site is identified in the IBV S protein that is essential for furin-dependent entry, syncytium formation and infectivity of IBV in cultured cells . It prompted us to examine the cellular content of furin in these cells. Western blotting analysis of Huh7, H1299, HeLa, 293T and A549 cells showed differential expression of furin (Fig. 4a) . Quantification of the corresponding bands by densitometry showed that the relative furin abundances in these five cell lines are 293T (0.04), A549 (0.18), HeLa (0.29), H1299 (0.56) and Huh7 (treated as 1) (Fig. 4a) .

To study further the infection kinetics of IBV infection and to compare the viral infectivity in these cells, the same number of cells (2 \u00c2 10 6 ) was plated. After incubation for 14 h, cells were infected with IBV-Luc at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 2, harvested at 24 h post-infection, and the luciferase activities were measured (Shen et al., 2009 ). The highest readings were consistently obtained from IBV-infected Huh7 cells, and were considered as 100% infection efficiency for each passage of IBV in this cell line, and the readings in other cells were shown as percentages of that in Huh7 cells (Fig. 4b) . Compared to IBVinfected Huh7 cells, the percentages of the relative luciferase activity (relative IBV infectivity) in IBV-infected H1299, 293T, HeLa and A549 cells are 68.55, 19.32, 9.15 and 0.88%, respectively, at passage 1 (Fig. 4b) . At passage 2, the percentages were reduced to 26.29, 0.12, 0.46 and 0%, respectively, in IBV-infected H1299, 293T, HeLa and A549 cells (Fig. 4b) . At passage 5, the percentage in H1299 cells is 32.94%, and no infection was observed in the other three cell lines (Fig. 4b) . Based on the luciferase reading, IBV replication in H1299 cells at passages 2 and 5 appeared to be much reduced, compared to that in passage 1. However, no obvious reduction in IBV replication was observed when the virus was continuously propagated in this cell line, based on the growth curves shown in Fig. 3b . The reason for this discrepancy is currently unclear, but it may reflect the intrinsic differences of the two assays, that is, the luciferase assay is to measure the viral replication and protein synthesis in the cell and the growth curve is to measure the production of infectious virus particles.",

Once again, differential expression of furin in these cells was observed. Compared with the furin level in Huh7 (treated as 1), the relative furin abundances in these cells are Hep3B (0.6), HCT116 (0.13) and HepG2 (0.28), as determined by densitometry (Fig. 4c) . The data largely correlate with the permissiveness of these cell lines to productive IBV infection, with HepG2 cells as one exception, which was shown to have an intermediate level of furin. The reason why HepG2 cells could support efficient productive IBV infection but are with a relatively low furin abundance is currently unclear. It would point to the involvement of multiple host cell factors in either restriction or promotion of IBV infection and is worthy of further studies. H1299 cells were infected with H1299-p1, H1299-p5 and H1299-p20, respectively, and harvested at 0, 6, 10, 16, 24 and 36 h post-infection, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 5a , introduction of siRNA duplexes targeting furin into H1299 cells significantly reduced the furin expression at the protein level. However, only a marginal effect was achieved in Huh7 cells (Fig. 5a) , probably reflecting the poorer transfection efficiency in this cell line. Infection of these cells with IBV at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 1 showed formation of much smaller sycyntia in furin-knockdown H1299 cells at 20 h post-infection, compared to the control cells transfected with siRNA targeting EGFP (Fig. 5b) . Continuous propagation of IBV prepared from the same set of furin-knockdown and control cells led to a loss of viral infectivity from the second passage onward in furin-knockdown H1299 cells, but not in H1299 cells treated with siEGFP and Huh7 cells treated with siEGFP and siFurin, respectively (Fig. 5c ). More S protein was expressed in Huh7 cells transfected with siEGFP than did in siFurin-transfected cells, probably due to their relative higher furin abundance, which would in turn enhance viral infection (Fig. 5c) . Interestingly, higher expression of IBV S protein was detected in passage 2 of IBV-infected Huh7 cells treated with either siFurin or siEGFP than that in passage 1 (Fig. 5c) , correlating with the highest expression level of furin in this cell line. Taken together, these results confirm that the abundant expression of furin is one of the factors that support productive IBV infection in cultured cells.",

IBV Beaudette-42 and Holte strains could grow in BHK-21 cell line (Otsuki et al., 1979) , and the Beaudette strain of IBV from chicken embryo was adapted to Vero cells (Shen et al., 2003 (Shen et al., , 2004 . More recently, IBV was shown to infect HeLa cells depending on the status of the cells . However, the susceptibility of other cell lines to IBV has not been documented. In this study, cell lines of diverse species and tissue origins were shown to be susceptible to the Vero-adapted IBV. The virus was efficiently propagated in four human cell lines, including H1299, HepG2, Hep3B and Huh7, for at least 20 passages. Among the four cell lines, HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh7 cell lines are derived from human hepatoma, and H1299 cells are human cancer cells of lung origins, respectively.

Generally, IBV is not efficiently released to the culture medium even in highly permissive cells. When most cell lines were initially infected with Vero-adapted IBV, relatively efficient infection was observed. During subsequent passages of the virus in the more resistant cells, however, the viral infectivity was gradually attenuated and totally lost after less than five passages. Slightly less efficient IBV infection was even observed in H1299 cells transfected with siEGFP in passage 2, although the same treated H1299 cells could support productive IBV infection. As the initial virus stocks were prepared by freezing and thawing IBV-infected Vero cells, most infectious virus particles may be still associated with cellular membranes and cell debris from Vero cells. The presence of certain amounts of host enhancement factor(s) in these initial virus stocks may help to establish efficient infection during initial propagation of IBV in the less permissive cell lines. In fact, much less infection was observed in some of these cells when clarified virus stocks harvested from the culture media of IBV-infected Vero cells were used (data not shown), supporting the argument that cellular membranes and cell debris from Vero cells contained in the initial virus stocks may enhance IBV-infection of these less permissive cell lines during passage 1.",

            "text": "In this study, a membrane-bound cellular proprotein convertase, furin, is identified as a host cell factor that may enhance the productive IBV infection in cultured cells. Among the five cell lines tested in this study, Huh7 cells have the highest furin expression level, followed by H1299 cells. Both cell lines could support efficient virus replication and productive infection. HeLa cells, with an intermediate level of furin expression, were shown to be susceptible to IBV infection under certain circumstances , consistent with the observation in this study that a certain level of furin-mediated cleavage of S protein was observed in IBV-infected HeLa cells. Under the experimental conditions used in this study, this cell line could support productive IBV infection up to passage 4. The other two cell lines, A549 and 293T, have the lowest furin expression level and can be efficiently infected in passage 1 only; the infectivity dropped to almost undetectable levels in passage 2. It was noted that quite efficient infection occurs in 293T cells in passage 1, probably because 293T cells grow fast and tend to form large cell clumps as well as more compact lawns, which may facilitate coronavirus infection (Snijder et al., 2009) . Nevertheless, the facts that cellular furin content is nicely correlated with viral infectivity and productive IBV infection in these five human cell lines and that knockdown of furin by siRNA in H1299 aborts productive IBV infection provide solid evidence supporting the conclusion that furin is one of the host factors required for the establishment of productive IBV infection. The less consistent observations generated from G418-resistant furin-knockin A549 cell clones infected with IBV, on the other hand, point to the possibility that additional cellular factors are also involved in this process. In fact, it was recently reported that several cellular factors are actively involved in the IBV replication cycle. These include DDX1, MADP1 (zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA binding motif 1) and DNA polymerase delta (Tan et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2010 Xu et al., , 2011 . It is yet to be determined if the variation in the cellular contents of these proteins may also contribute to the replication efficiency of IBV in individual cell lines.",

The exact role of furin in enhancement of cell permissiveness to IBV infection is less clear. As furin-mediated cleavage of S protein at the second furin site was shown to play an important role in viral infectivity by promoting virus-cell and cell-cell fusion , it would be reasonable to speculate that furin may facilitate viral entry and spread. In this regard, subtle differences in expression of furin in different tissues and cells may explain why IBV infects one tissue but not another, although it is believed that furin is ubiquitously expressed (Bosshart et al., 1994; Molloy et al., 1994) . Further studies of the furin expression and distribution patterns in chicken and utilization of recombinant IBV containing sequences from different pathogenic IBV strains would provide more insights into IBV pathogenesis and cell and tissue tropisms.",
