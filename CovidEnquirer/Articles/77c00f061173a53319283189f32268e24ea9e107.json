            "text": "T he production of airborne material during dental procedures is obvious to the dentist, the dental team and the patient. An aerosol cloud of particulate matter and fluid often is clearly visible during dental procedures. This cloud is evident during tooth preparation with a rotary instrument or air abrasion, during the use of an air-water syringe, during the use of an ultrasonic scaler and during air polishing. This ubiquitous aerosolized cloud is a combination of materials originating from the treatment site and from the dental unit waterlines, or DUWLs. It is common for the patient to comment on this cloud of material. With the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, questions concerning the potential for the spread of infections from this aerosol may arise.",

            "text": "The potential routes for the spread of infection in a dental office are direct contact with body fluids of an infected patient, contact with environmental surfaces or instruments that have been contaminated by the patient and contact with infectious particles from the patient that have become airborne. 1 There is a long history of infections that have been transmitted by an airborne route. Even before the discovery of specific infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses, the potential of infection by the airborne route was recognized. In historical reports of the bubonic plague-the \"black plague\"-the pneumonic form of the disease was recognized as the most deadly. Historical accounts have noted that the pneumonic form of the plague, characterized by severe coughing, has been spread from patients who had the pneumonic form of plague to those who surrounded the patient but were not necessarily in direct contact. Apparently, because the bacteria that cause plague (Yersinia pestis) were inhaled, the pneumonic form of the disease was reported to progress more rapidly than other forms of plague, and historical reports indicate that it was almost universally fatal. 2 There are more recent examples of the spread of disease by an airborne route. In one published report, a number of people were exposed to tuberculosis, or TB, while on a commercial airline flight. A patient with active TB boarded an airplane in Chicago en route to Honolulu. During the flight, the patient coughed repeatedly, aerosolizing the tubercle bacillus, which then entered the airplane's ventilation system and subsequently spread to other parts of the airplane cabin. After it was confirmed that the patient had active TB, it was determined that 15 of the 55 passengers in the cabin who were tested had been exposed to TB, as confirmed by a positive tuberculin test. Passengers seated within two rows of the source patient had a higher probability of a positive skin test than did those seated elsewhere in the cabin. 3 Another published example occurred in a medical office where the measles virus was spread through the ventilation system to multiple people. The source patient was a 12-year-old boy who was coughing. Of the seven people who had secondary cases of measles that were associated with him, three were never in the same room with the source patient and one entered the office an hour after he had left. 4 More common is the apparent spread of cold and influenza viruses by airborne routes. However, the actual documentation of an airborne route for transmission of cold and influenza viruses is difficult to verify. Because cold and flu viruses can be transmitted by contact, contaminated objects and an airborne route, in a flu outbreak it often is difficult to know the exact route by which the virus is transferred. SARS recently has been reported in China, Canada and other countries. This severe flulike illness appears to be caused by a new form of coronavirus, a family of viruses usually associated with the common cold. The exact mechanisms by which SARS is spread remains uncertain, but it is clear that the primary method is through aerosolized droplets produced by coughing or other means. In a Hong Kong apartment complex outbreak, it appeared that the disease may have been spread through ventilation systems by airborne viruses that were independent of larger droplets. 5 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, and the ADA have recommended that aerosol-producing procedures should be avoided in patients with active SARS. The ADA has pointed out that it is unlikely that any dental treatment will be performed on a patient with active SARS, owing to the fact that these patients are extremely ill and should not undergo any elective procedures. 6,7",

The usual method for transmission of TB is through the formation of droplet nuclei. 15 These form when a droplet of sputum or saliva containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis is projected from the patient by coughing or potentially by splatter from a dental procedure. As the droplet begins to evaporate, the size of the droplet becomes smaller, and it then has the potential to stay airborne or to become reairborne as a dust particle. Thus, splatter droplets also may be a potential source of infection in a dental treatment setting. Splatter and droplet nuclei also have been implicated in the transmission of diseases other than TB, such as SARS, measles and herpetic viruses. Some diseases known to be spread via an airborne route are listed in Table 1 .",

These may included various pathogenic viruses and bacteria that are present in the saliva and oral fluids. Any dental procedure that has the potential to aerosolize saliva will cause airborne contamination with organisms from some or all of these sources. The most serious potential threat present in aerosols is M. tuberculosis, the organism that causes TB. In the past, TB was viewed as an occupational hazard of dentistry. 17, 18 While the number of active TB cases in the United States is relatively small, certain populations such as the homeless, prisoners and recent immigrants have a higher percentage of TB infection. 19 Patients known to have active TB should be treated using special respiratory precautions so that the aerosols produced during treatment can be controlled.

However, it is reasonable to suppose that components of saliva, nasopharyngeal secretions, plaque, blood, tooth components and any material used in the dental procedure, such as abrasives for air polishing and air abrasion, all are present in dental aerosols. In the past, studies usually concentrated on the number of bacteria present in dental aerosols; several recent studies have analyzed the presence of blood components in dental aerosols. 21, 22 Multiple studies have been conducted to determine which dental procedure produces the most airborne bacterial contamination. 23 studies, researchers have measured the number of bacteria that settle on growth media plates over a specific period. In almost all instances, a nonselective bacterial growth media such as blood agar has been used. When an aerobic bacterium settles on the plates and grows as a colony, it will be counted as a colony-forming unit, or CFU. Most results have been reported as the total CFUs produced during the various dental procedures. This method gives a good picture of the increase in total airborne bacterial CFUs from a particular procedure, but it does not provide any differentiation between whether the bacteria are relatively benign or a pathogenic species. Any bacteria that require special media or growth conditions, such as mycobacteria or strict anaerobes that are common in periodontal pockets, will not grow on media used in these tests and therefore are not counted. Also, because they do not grow on the type of media used for bacterial studies, no viral particles such as influenza, rhinoviruses and SARS coronovirus would be measured. Table 2 lists the dental instruments and procedures that produce the greatest amount of aerosols. Because of the methods used, bacterial growth studies give only a partial picture of the airborne contamination that occurs during dental procedures. However, in relative terms these studies can be viewed as providing a good comparative index of the amount of airborne material that is generated during various dental procedures. Using the bacterial growth method, the ultrasonic scaler has been shown to produce the greatest amount of airborne contamination, followed by the air-driven high-speed handpiece, the air polisher and various other instruments such as the airwater syringe and prophylaxis angles. 12,23-28 To date, no studies have been performed on the bacterial contamination produced by air abrasion.",

It is important that this aerosol cloud be controlled to the greatest extent possible to reassure patients and dental personnel. It also should be recognized that contaminated aerosols are produced during dental procedures when there are little or no visible aerosols. As has been shown in the study of aerosol production by ultrasonic scalers when no coolant water was used, even in the complete absence of coolant water there is aerosolization of material from the operative site. 20 During routine dental treatment, there is a strong likelihood that aerosolized material will include viruses, blood, and supra-and subgingival plaque organisms.",

A true aerosol or droplet nuclei may be present in the air of the operatory for up to 30 minutes after a procedure. 13 This means that after a dental procedure, if the operator removes a protective barrier such as a face mask to talk to a patient when a procedure is completed, the potential for contact with airborne contaminated material remains. Also, there is a potential for an airborne contaminant to enter the ventilation system and spread to areas of the facility where barrier protection is not used. One method of reducing overall bacterial counts produced during dental procedures is the use of a preprocedural rinse. The use of a .01 percent chlorhexidine or essential oil-containing mouthwash for one minute before a dental procedure has been shown to significantly reduce the bacterial count in the air of the operatory. 31, 32 Chlorhexidine is an effective antiseptic for freefloating oral bacteria such as those found in the saliva and those loosely adhering to mucus membranes. Chlorhexidine, however, does not affect bacteria in a biofilm such as established dental plaque, does not penetrate subgingivally, will not affect blood coming directly from the operative site and is unlikely to affect viruses and bacteria harbored in the nasopharynx. While preprocedural rinses will reduce the extent of contamination within dental aerosols as routinely measured on agar plates, they do not eliminate the infectious potential of dental aerosols.",

In certain restorative procedures such as subgingival restorations and the final steps of crown preparation, it often is impossible to use a rubber dam. The use of a rubber dam also is not feasible for periodontal and hygiene procedures such as root planing, periodontal surgery and routine prophylaxis.

The use of a high-volume evacuator, or HVE, has been shown to reduce the contamination arising from the operative site by more than 90 percent. 8, 23, [33] [34] [35] It should be emphasized that for a suction system to be classified as an HVE, it must remove a large volume of air within a short period. An evacuator that pulls a high vacuum but does not remove a large volume of air, such as is used routinely for hospital suction, is not considered an HVE. The usual HVE used in dentistry has a large opening (usually 8 millimeters or greater) and is attached to an evacuation system that will remove a large volume of air (up to 100 cubic feet of air per minute). The small opening of a saliva ejector does not remove a large enough volume of air to be classified as an HVE.",
