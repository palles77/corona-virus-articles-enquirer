ABO blood group system Probably the best known of the blood group systems, involves a single gene locus that codes for a fucosyl transferase. If the H-gene is expressed then fucose is added to the terminal galactose of the precursor oligosaccharide on the red cell surface and the A-or B-gene products, also glycosyl-transferases, can then add N-acetyl galactosamine or galactose to produce the A or Bantigens respectively. Antibodies to the ABO antigens occur naturally and make this an important set of antigens for blood transfusion. Transfusion of mismatched blood with surface red cell antigens that elicit a response leads to a transfusion reaction. The natural antibodies are usually IgM.

The slug cells differentiate into elongated stalk cells and spores, where the cells are surrounded by a cellulose capsule. The spores are released from the sporangium at the tip of the stalk and, in favourable conditions, an amoeba emerges from the capsule, feeds, divides and so establishes a new population.

Can be produced by fires. acrosin Serine peptidase (EC 3.4.21.10, 402aa) stored in the acrosome of a sperm as an inactive precursor (proacrosin), activated by zona pellucida glycoproteins during the acrosome reaction and involved in penetration by the sperm of the outer layers of the egg. Activation involves the removal of a C-terminal proline-rich segment and the cleavage into light and heavy chains. Acrosin binding protein (543aa) is found in testis.",

Various proteins (profilin, thymosin beta-4, gelsolin) stabilize G-actin (i.e., prevent it from polymerizing) and a range of other proteins associate with filamentous actin, stabilizing it, cross-linking it, moving along it or anchoring it to other components. There are various isoforms: actin alpha1 in skeletal muscle, actin alpha2 in smooth muscle, actin alphaC1 in cardiac muscle. Actins beta and gamma are found in non-muscle cells.

Some bind to G-actin and prevent it from adding onto the linear F-actin filaments (e.g. profilin), or keep actin levels very low in the nuclear compartment (exportin-6) others act as nucleating centres for polymerization (e.g. hisactophilin and bacterial proteins such as ActA) or block the preferred assembly (barbed) end of filaments to stabilize their length (e.g. capZ). Some will cleave filaments (gelsolin), others link filaments to one another as isotropic gels (filamin) or bundles that may be parallel or antiparallel (e.g. villin), yet others attach bundles or individual filaments to membranes or membrane-embedded adhesion proteins. Microfilaments may have regulatory proteins associated with them that prevent the attachment of myosin unless calcium is present (tropomyosin); filaments may be linked to other cytoskeletal elements through various scaffolding proteins (IQGAPs) or to a membrane-skeleton (e.g. spectrin).

The human form (ADF, destrin, 165aa) has 95% homology to chick ADF. ADF has a nuclear localization domain and the interaction with actin is regulated by phosphoinositides. Both ADF and cofilin are associated with Hirano bodies. The ADF domain (ADF-homology domain) is an actinbinding motif found in three phylogenetically distinct families of proteins, ADF/cofilins, twinfilins and drebin/ABP-1s.",

In angiosperms two forms are distinguished, gametophytic apomixis in which the embryo arises from an unfertilized egg cell (parthenogenetically) and sporophytic apomixis (adventitious embryony) where the embryo is formed from nucellus (nucellar embryony) or integumental tissue.

Regulation of the operon is by the AraC gene product that binds to the operator, AraI, site and another AroO site, forming a loop in the DNA which represses transcription of the operon.

Arabidopsis response regulators, a twocomponent system in plants, involved in histidine (His) to aspartate (Asp) phosphorelay signal transduction. The ARRs can be subdivided into three discrete groups, the A-type ARRs and B-type ARRs and a novel group of ARRs consisting of ARR22 and ARR24. The B-type ARRs are transcription factors acting as partially redundant positive regulators of cytokinin signal transduction. A-type ARRs are products of a family of 10 genes that are rapidly induced by cytokinin and are highly similar to bacterial two-component response regulators. They may be partially redundant negative regulators of cytokinin signalling but seem to have a more general function in the integration and coordination of several signalling processes, such as those of light, the circadian clock and control of stem cell number.

It may occur, as in Farmer's Lung, as a reaction to natural exposure to antigen.articulins Membrane-associated protein complex of Euglena; two isoforms of 80 and 86 kDa, completely unlike spectrin, though functionally analogous. Have a core domain of 12-residue repeats, rich in valine and proline. May attach directly to membrane proteins. Articulins in protists: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed/9788878 artifical selection Conventional genetic engineering, the selection of progeny by a plant or animal breeder, rather than by environmental factors (natural selection). Quite remarkable phenotypic alterations can be brought about \u00c0 a classic example being the variety of breeds of dogs. Order of herbivorous even-toed mammals that includes antelopes, pig, cow, giraffe and hippopotamus.ARVDSee arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy. aryl hydrocarbon receptor See AHR.aryl sulphatase Aryl sulphatases A, B and C comprise a group of enzymes originally assayed by their ability to hydrolyze O-sulphate esters of aromatic substrates. Aryl sulphatase A (arylsulfatase A, EC 3.1.6.8, 507aa) is a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyses cerebroside 3-sulphate and is deficient in metachromatic leukodystrophy. Aryl sulphatase B (N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulphatase, EC 3.1.6.12, 533aa) is deficient in Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome. Aryl sulphatase C (steroid sulphatase, EC 3.1.6.2, 583aa) hydrolyzes estrogen sulphates. All three are deficient in multiple sulphatase deficiency. Many other aryl sulphatases (e.g. arylsulphatase E, ARSE, 594aa) are known.arylation Addition of an aryl group to a substrate, often catalysed by palladium. Not a enzymatic reaction, although the removal of aryl groups (for example by aryl sulphatase) can be carried out in biological systems.AS-2 See adocia sulphate.AS-252424 Potent and selective inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI(3)K) p110\u03b3, shown to be selective for class IB PI(3)K-mediated cellular effects, e.g. inhibits C5a-mediated phosphorylation of Akt in RAW 264.7 macrophages and neutrophil recruitment in a mouse model of peritonitis.ASA-GSH cycle The ascorbate (AsA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) cycle that removes reactive oxygen species from the chloroplast, especially under stress conditions.

Their characteristic histochemical behaviour arises from 5-HT (serotonin), which they secrete. Found chiefly in the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract (though possibly of neural crest origin) their function is rather obscure, although there is a widely distributed family of such paracrine (local endocrine) cells (APUD cells).argentation chromatography Modified form of standard thin layer chromatography in which the solid phase includes silver salts. Used for lipid analysis.arginine An essential amino acid (Arg, R, 174Da); a major component of proteins and contains the guanido group that has a pK a of greater than 12, so that it carries a permanent positive charge at physiological pH. See Table A1 .argonaute Eukaryotic translation initiation factors (argonaute 1\u00c04, AGO1\u00c04, B857aa) that are required for RNA-mediated gene silencing. Argonaute proteins are concentrated in GW bodies and are components of RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC), binding the single-stranded siRNA and miRNA. RNA is required for the integrity of GW bodies and RNase eliminates Argonaute two localization. In Drosophila, unlike in humans, both AGO1 and AGO2 have slicer activity. Prokaryotic Ago proteins have unknown function but are similar to eukaryotic proteins. RNA interference and related RNA silencing phenomena use short antisense guide RNA molecules to repress the expression of target genes. Contain amino-terminal PAZ (for PIWI/ Argonaute/Zwille) domains and carboxy-terminal PIWI domains.argyrophil cells Neuroendocrine cells that take up silver ions from a staining solution but require the addition of a reducing agent to precipitate metallic silver (unlike argentaffin cells which do not). Carcinoids of the foregut tend to be argyrophilic whereas those of the lower intestine tend to be argentaffinic.ARIA Acetylcholine Receptor Inducing Activity, a polypeptide (heregulin-1 residues 177\u00c0244) purified from chick brain that stimulates transcription of acetylcholine receptor subunits in nuclei that underlie the developing synapses in chick myotubes.

In dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy the highly polymorphic region of polyglutamine repeats is expanded from the normal 7\u00c023 copies to 49\u00c075 repeats. Atrophin-1-related protein (arginine-glutamic acid dipeptide repeats protein, 1566aa) acts as a a transcriptional repressor during development and interacts with atrophin one, the interaction being stronger if there are more repeats. Atrophin-interacting proteins include MAGI (ATN interacting protein 1, 1455aa) and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy homologue (ATN-interacting protein 4, 903aa).atrophy Wasting away of tissue with loss of mass and/or function.atropine An alkaloid, isolated from Deadly Nightshade, Atropa belladonna, that inhibits muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Applied to the eye causes dilation of the pupil that is said to enhance the beauty of a woman, hence belladonna as the specific name of the plant from which the ancients extracted the drug. attacins Antibacterial proteins (B200\u00c0240aa) produced by insect haemocytes following bacterial challenge. May be basic or acidic and are fairly highly conserved between species. Induction of these myelocytomatosis, osteopetrosis, lymphoid leukosis and nephroblastoma. May be a mixture of viruses.avidin Biotin-binding protein (152aa) from eggwhite. Binding is so strong as to be effectively irreversible \u00c0 a diet of raw egg-white leads to biotin deficiency. Avidin affinity columns can be used to affinity-purify biotinylated proteins.avidity Strength of binding, usually of a small molecule with multiple binding sites by a larger; particularly the binding of a complex antigen by an antibody.
