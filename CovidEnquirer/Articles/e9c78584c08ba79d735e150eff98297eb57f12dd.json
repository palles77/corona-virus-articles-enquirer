All the sequences from mainland China (GZ01 and BJ01-04) clustered together and separated from the remaining sequences. Interestingly, CUHK-W1 shared some common variants with those from mainland China, suggesting multiple sources of SARS-CoV in Hong Kong. A maximum parsimony tree was similar to that in Figure S1 .",

The earliest occurrence of SARS was reported in the Guangdong province of China and an index patient A infected a number of people in Hong Kong on February 21, 2003 who subsequently caused outbreaks in several countries/regions [1]. The phylogeny was also supported by considering the common variants alone. Among 18 non-singletons, nine of which could be assigned to the internal branches. Five variants located at the internal branches leading to the sequences (except CUHK-W1) derived form the index patient A. among 16 SARS-CoV genomic sequences reconstructed by neighbor-joining method. Sequence information is shown in table 4. Nine of the 18 common variants could be assigned to internal branches (labeled by a star). Five common variants (sites 17564, 19838, 22222, 27243, and 27827) located at two branches to separate the sequences isolated in mainland China (GZ01 and BJ01-04) from the others (except CUHK-W1) derived from the index patient A.
