However, the primary care system in South Korea is not well established, and primary care research is still in its infancy. This study aimed to show the benefits of regular doctors as primary care providers in South Korea by analyzing the effect of regular doctor visits on emergency room (ER) visits. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data on 11,293 adults aged 18 years and over collected from the 2013 Korea Health Panel Survey (beta version 1.0). We classified those participants with and without regular doctors into the treatment and control groups, respectively, and estimated the average treatment effect (ATE) of having a regular doctor on ER visits. We used counterfactual framework and propensity score analysis to adjust for unevenly distributed confounding covariates between treatments and control groups. Results: The estimated conditional ATE of a regular doctor on ER visits was statistically insignificant in the general population (-0.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.0 to 1.2) and in the subgroup of patients with hypertension (-1.8%; 95% CI, -4.5 to 0.9). However, in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), the estimated ATE was statistically significant (-5.0; 95% CI, -9.2 to -0.7). Conclusion: In the total study population, having a regular doctor did not result in a significant difference in ER visits. However, there was a decrease in ER visits in patients with DM in South Korea.",

However, the primary care system in South Korea is not yet well-established. The Korean health care system is market-oriented and focused on treatment rather than prevention, which encourages further diagnosis and utilization of the large hospital sector. This leads to medically undesirable and unnecessary health care utilization and increased costs. 1) The recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in South Korea was also related to the failure of the Korean primary care system. Therefore, strengthening of the primary care is essential for solving many health care problems in South Korea.",

We did not reach the perfect causal inference because of unobserved Heterogeneity and Endogeneity partly.

Therefore, further research on the effect of these characteristics is required.There are few studies in Korea on visits to the ER when there is a USC available.29,30) Chai et al.29) used annual data from the 2009-2011KoHPS.In that study, logistic regression analysis for ER use in the research group revealed that the group without USC visited the ER 0.78 times less often. 29) Subjects with a USC or with chronic diseases may more often visit the ER because of concerns about their health or due to poor health conditions. Furthermore, limited access to primary care leads to more frequent ER visits.31) Lee et al.30) performed a panel analysis utilizing data from the 2012-2103 KoHPS, showing the effect of having a regular doctor in adult patients with DM on ER visits. The relationship between having a USC and ER visits in patients with DM varied depending on the USC characteristics (medical institutions versus physician), but having a regular doctor was related to fewer ER visits. After controlling confounding variables (income level, health conditions, medical security type), the panel analysis showed that having a regular doctor reduced the incidence of ER visits.",
