The respiratory epithelium infected with ADV showed spreading necrosis of epithelial cells. Many ADV particles were observed in epithelial cells from 1 to 4 days after inoculation.

The apparent discrepancy in the role of the respiratory tract in different reports is due to differences in affinity of various strains of the virus for respiratory tissue. The YS-81TR strain of ADV had greater affinity for respiratory tissue than did the YS-81 strain infected in HPCD pigs (Narita el al., 1989 (Narita el al., , 1990 ). In the present study, destruction of the tracheal epithelium induced by ADV infection showed the same severity between the YS-81TR and YS-81 strains of ADV. Thus, it is very difficult to differentiate virus virulence in the organ culture.",

Many viruses, such as influenza virus, have been reported to cause inhibition of ciliary activity in human and calf tracheal organ culture (Tyrrell, Bynoe and Hoorn, 1965; Reed, 1969) . In the present study, ADV infection induced markedly flattened and irregular cells, or it completely destroyed ciliated epithelial cells. Moreover, the ADV antigen was firstly localized in ciliated epithelial cells, and ciliated epithelial cells in ADV infection were more susceptible than non-ciliated ones. These findings suggested that ADV infection might reduce ciliary activity and decrease resistance to bacterial infection.",
