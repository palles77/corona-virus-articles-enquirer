It is urgent to generate new chemical entities against this virus. As a key enzyme in the life-cycle of coronavirus, the 3C-like main protease (3CL pro or M pro ) is the most attractive for antiviral drug design. Based on a recently solved structure (PDB ID: 6LU7), we developed a novel advanced deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug design (ADQN-FBDD) for generating potential lead compounds targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . We obtained a series of derivatives from those lead compounds by our structure-based optimization policy (SBOP). All the 47 lead compounds directly from our AI-model and related derivatives based on SBOP are accessible in our molecular library at https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov. These compounds can be used as potential candidates for researchers in their development of drugs against SARS-CoV-2.",

No reuse allowed without permission. : bioRxiv preprint disease (COVID-19) worldwide. 1 As of March 2, 2020, more than 90,000 people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 3000 people have been reported dead according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus map tracker. 2 The numbers of infection and death are still increasing. To face the considerable threat of SARS-CoV-2, it is urgent to develop new inhibitors or drugs against this deadly virus. Unfortunately, since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) eighteen years ago, there has been no approved treatment against the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 3 which is similar to SARS-CoV-2. Repurposing potential drugs such as lopinavir and ritonavir also failed to SARS-CoV-2 injected patients. 4 Structure-based antiviral drug design with a new artificial intelligence algorithm may represent a more helpful approach to get the SARS-CoV-2 targeted inhibitors or drugs. Thanks to the prompt efforts of many researchers, we have several pieces of important information about this vital virus genome and protein structures. We now know that the non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5) is the main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 and it is a cysteine protease, which also been called \"3C-like protease\" (3CL pro ). Moreover, we know that the 3D structure of 3CL pro is very similar to SARS-CoV with a sequence identity of >96% and 3D structure superposition RMSDC\u03b1 of 0.44 \u00c5 as shown in Figures S1 and S2. 3CL pro has been reported as an attractive target for developing anti-coronaviral drugs: 1) this protease is highly conserved in both sequences and 3D structures; 5 2) 3CL pro is a key enzyme for related virus (including SARS and SARS-CoV-2) replication; 3) it only exists in the virus, not in humans. Developing specific antiviral drugs targeting 3CL pro of the specific virus has shown significant success; for example, both approved drugs lopinavir and ritonavir can completely occupy the substrate-binding site of 3CL pro to break down the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, due to the large difference between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , lopinavir and ritonavir were validated ineffective for inhibiting SARS-Cov-2. 4 On the other hand, the substrate-binding site of 3CL pro is almost the same between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS as Figure S3 presents. The developed potential inhibitors and drug-design experience targeting SARS-3CL pro may also be applicable to SARS-CoV-2. For author/funder. All rights reserved.

AI, especially deep learning, has been applied in predicting molecular properties 30, 31, 32, 33 and designing novel molecules 34 . Unlike earlier deep-learning molecular design by adding single atom one at a time 34, 35 , our approach explores new molecules by adding a meaningful molecular fragment one by one, which is not only computationally more efficient but also chemically more reasonable. To make our AI model work well, the first step is to prepare the molecular fragment library as shown in Figure 1 . We used our collected SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors (284 molecules) as the initial molecule database targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . Then, we split this set of molecules into fragments with a molecule weight no more than 200 daltons. Both of the collected inhibitors and the fragments are supplied in https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov.",

In total, 47 of these compounds were selected with high scores from our AImodel's reward function. Then these molecules were further evaluated by docking and covalent docking studies. The lead compound #46 with a high covalent docking score attracts our attention, which also has a low difference between non-covalent and covalent docking pose among the 47 lead compounds. After carefully checking the lead #46's interaction mode with 3CL pro , we believe there is still much space to optimize lead it. Then we designed a series of derivatives from compound #46 based on our chemical biology knowledge and the structure-based optimization policy. All the generated molecular structures are published in our code library https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov.

So, there is no delayed or sparse reward issue as many other reinforced frameworks suffered. 40, 41 Furthermore, to ensure that the last state is rewarded the most, we use \u03b3 T-t to discount the value of the rewards at state ' .

This way may be useful in testing the performance of RL methods but not suitable in a real-world drug design because no one knows the complete structural information of the novel molecule. A more practical approach is to learn the structure features of existing drugs or inhibitors to local, focused chemical space for a specific protein target. Instead of simply putting attention on the diversity of molecule structure, we explore the possibility of generating novel molecules based on the existing knowledge.

In this work, our robust and efficient computational method and pipeline for designing compounds can provide useful drug candidates for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections. For more information about our AI model generated leads and SBDD optimized derivatives, please go to the library https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov. These candidates or their variants have a good chance to produce valid leads of anti-COVID-19 drugs. It is understood that the computational design requires experimental validations. While we are exploring experimental validations ourselves, we like to release these candidates promptly for other researchers to accelerate the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs given the emergency of seeking treatments for the disease.Comparing with other deep RL methods, ADQN-FBDD has several highlights: 1) It directly modifies and generate molecular structures without format conversion problems while some other tools such as Insilico Medicine's GENTRL (https://insilico.com) may generate invalid SMILES output. 2) Most of the generative models require pre-training on a specific dataset and then produce the molecules with high similarities to a given training set. For example, the best molecule from Insilico Medicine for their target DDR1 was actually very similar to the kinase inhibitor Iclusig (ponatinib) on the market.37 ADQN-FBDD does not need pre-training at all and has a capacity to generate novel molecules.3) The process of generating molecules is very author/funder.
