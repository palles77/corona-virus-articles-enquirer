The lacrimal gland is large, bilobulated, and pale red in color, occupying the orbit adjacent to the lower rim; it is narrow in form with bulbous enlargements at each canthus. The lacrimal gland is a serous-secreting, compound, tubular gland surrounded by a fibrous connective tissue capsule; the lobes are divided into lobules by loose connective tissue septa containing reticular and collagenous elastic fibers. In the rabbit the lacrimal gland plays a lesser role in lubricating the eye than it does in humans, and the effect of removal of the lacrimal gland is diminished by compen satory secretions from the gland of the third eyelid and Harder's gland. Although transient keratoconjunctivitis sicca may be ob served following partial removal of the gland, signs disappear, supposedly owing to the regeneration of the tissue.",

The gland is roughly kidney shaped with two distinct lobes, a pink lobe and a white lobe; the size and dispersion of lipid droplets in the gland probably account for the difference in color. The cells of the gland differ in shape as well. In the pink lobe the cells of the acini are cuboidal and filled with lipid droplets which are larger than those in the white lobe. In the white lobe, the acini are formed by columnar epithelium with smaller lipid droplets. The two lobes appear to have similar function, which includes being an integral part of the secretory immune system. There is a single duct which opens onto the inferior part of the bulbar surface of the third eyelid, to which the gland is attached. The gland of the third eyelid closely resembles Harder's gland in structure and is situated surrounding the shaft of the cartilage of the third eyelid.

In the white lobe, the acini are formed by columnar epithelium with smaller lipid droplets.

Lipid keratopathy and other systemic manifestations of high fat diets fed to rabbits have been described (Roscoe and Riccaroli, 1969; Gwin and Gelatt, 1977; Stock et al., 1985) , and similar lesions occur in the Wantabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit (Garibaldi and Pecquet Goad, 1988) . Corneal lipidosis, unlike dystrophies, will induce an inflammatory reaction with corneal neovascularization as well as macrophage and neutrophil infiltration. Corneal lipid deposition typically occurs in the anterior stroma, basement membrane, and epithelium. The lipid keratopathy usually begins at the limbus either focally or circumferentially and can spread centrally. Dietary-induced lipid infiltration and inflammation have also been reported in the sclera, third eyelid, iris, ciliary body, and choroid.",

Early studies utilized abrasion of the epithelial surface by one of a variety of methods followed by topical application of HSV; however, abrasion is not required, and simple inoculation and massage through the eyelids routinely cause the disease. A number of significant variables exist, including inoculation technique, virus strain, and breed of rabbit; in general, HSV type I (HSV-I) produces a mild to moderate conjunctivitis followed by punctate epithelial erosions by day 4 which coa- lesce to form a dendritic geographic ulcer by day 7; lesions resolve with minimal scarring and occasional vascularization by days 14-21.

Injection of I% kaolin into the anterior chamber obstructs the outflow channels, and lOP reached 50-70 mm Hg within 14 days (Voronina, 1954) . Encircling the globe with constricting threads (Skotnicki, 1957) or bands (Flocks et aI., 1959) caused high lOP (70-100 mm Hg) which decreased to 35-50 mm Hg within 48 hr; one-third of the eyes in one study developed endophthalmitis (Flocks et al., 1959) . Polyethylene tubing threaded into the rabbit iridocorneal angle caused an increase in lOP within 24 hr that remained elevated for 6 months; loss of retinal ganglion cells occurred (Kupfer, 1962; Malik et aI., 1970) . Intraocular injection of methylcel-luJose will cause a transient elevation of lOP (Samis, 1962; Kazdan and MacDonald, 1963) , whereas injection of cotton fragments induces a more prolonged elevation (deCarvalho, 1962) . Injection of 75 units of a-chymotrypsin into the anterior chamber resulted in a chronic moderate elevation of lOP (up to 50 mm Hg) in 50% of both pigmented and nonpigmented rabbit eyes (Best et aI., 1975) . Subconjunctival injection of sclerosing agents such as phenol caused long-term elevation of lOP (Malik et aI., 1970; Luntz, 1966) . Intracameral injection of autologous fixed red blood cells resulted in a chronic, variable, but dramatic elevation of lOP associated with a hemolytic inflammatory process; optic nerve changes were documented in the model (Fig. II) . Perhaps the model that is most desirable utilized an argon laser to occlude the iridocorneal angle in pigmented rabbits; laser parameters included 200-275 50-fJ-m spots, 0.1-0.2 sec, 1.2-1.6 W, and 32.8-78 joules of total energy; an lOP elevation of28-50 mm Hg occurred in 50% of treated rabbits (Gherezghiher et al., 1986) .",

Rabbits have served us well in our understanding of normal ocular form and function and the pathogenesis and management of ophthalmic disease, but likely not optimally. Species variation in the sensitivity and nature of the blood-ocular barriers has been addressed. Differences between breeds and strains and especially between nonpigmented and pigmented eyes have not been elaborated on but warrant consideration. There are demonstrated differences in drug distribution (Barza et al., 1979) and neural pathways (Oyster et al., 1987) between nonpigmented and pigmented eyes; empirical observations with regard to species-specific tissue responsiveness, hypertensive response to corticosteroids, and numerous other experimental conditions have been made. The albino eye is a reasonable model to study parameters in albinos, but the vast majority of humans (to which most modeling is extrapolated) have melanin in the iris, ciliary, and retinal pigment epithelium as well as the uvea. The continued use of the New Zealand White rabbit as a model for ophthalmic and visual experimentation is difficult to rationalize, and the use of pigmented rabbits will result in better scientific studies.",
