We report that 5-10% of malaria-exposed individuals, but none of the European blood donors tested, have high levels of LAIR1-containing antibodies that dominate the response to IEs without conferring enhanced protection against febrile malaria. By analyzing the antibody-producing B cell clones at the protein, cDNA and gDNA level, we characterized additional LAIR1 insertions between the V and DJ segments and discovered a second insertion modality whereby the LAIR1 exon encoding the extracellular domain and flanking intronic sequences are inserted into the switch region. By exon shuffling, this mechanism leads to the production of bispecific antibodies in which the LAIR1 domain is precisely positioned at the elbow between the VH and CH1 domains. Additionally, in one donor the gDNA encoding the VH and CH1 domains was deleted, leading to the production of a camellike LAIR1-containing antibody. Sequencing of the switch regions of memory B cells from European blood donors revealed frequent templated inserts originating from transcribed genes that, in rare cases, comprised exons with orientation and frame compatible with expression. Collectively, these results reveal different modalities of LAIR1 insertion that lead to public and dominant antibodies against IEs and suggest that insertion of templated DNA represents an additional mechanism of antibody diversification that can be selected in the immune response against pathogens and exploited for B cell engineering.",

To establish the prevalence of LAIR1containing antibodies among malaria-exposed individuals, we screened plasma samples from two large cohorts in Tanzania3 and Mali4. To identify LAIR1-containing antibodies irrespective of their specificity for parasite isolates, we developed a two-determinant immunoassay using beads coated with anti-LAIR1 or a control antibody. Six out of 112 Tanzanian donors (5.4%) and 57 out of 656 Malian donors (8.7%) had detectable levels of LAIR1-containing IgG (Fig. 1a ). In addition, 2-4% of African donors had LAIR1-containing IgM, with no or variable levels of LAIR1-containing IgG (Fig. 1b, c) . In contrast, only 3 and 4 out of 1043 European blood donors showed a low positivity in the IgG and IgM LAIR1 assay, respectively. The presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies was confirmed by the isolation of 52 immortalized B cell clones from seven East and West African donors (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ), while we were not able to isolate LAIR1-containing monoclonal antibodies from four European donors that showed serum reactivity. The finding that 5-10% of individuals living in malaria-endemic regions produce LAIR1-containing antibodies is suggestive of a public antibody response.",

The cDNA of clones isolated from donors M (Malian) and J (Tanzanian) contained only the LAIR1 exon, which was precisely located between the JH and CH1. In both cases, gDNA analysis revealed that a DNA fragment comprising the LAIR1 exon flanked by intronic sequences was inserted into the switch \u03bc region (Extended Data Fig. 2 ) and, by alternative splicing, gave rise to two mRNA variants with or without the LAIR1 insert. This was confirmed by the production of antibodies with or without LAIR1 in similar proportions by a single B cell clone (Fig. 2e) . Another example of LAIR1 insertion into the switch region was observed in donor B (Kenyan), from whom we isolated a B cell clone (MGB47) producing a truncated LAIR1-containing IgG3 heavy chain without an attached light chain (Fig. 2f, g) . In this clone, the gDNA carried multiple deletions that removed most of the VDJ and the entire CH1 region, leading to the production of a camel-like antibody5 (Fig. 2d ).

Antibody constructs carrying LAIR1 stained IEs and were recognized by an anti-LAIR1 antibody, independent of the LAIR1 position in the scaffold. While insertion of LAIR1 into the CDR3 of an antibody specific for the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)6 abolished binding to GM-CSF, insertion of LAIR1, programmed cell death-1 (PD1), or signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member (SLAM) Ig-like domains into the elbow region did not affect binding to GM-CSF. This indicates that the VH-CH1 elbow is permissive for insertions of different domains without affecting the original antibody specificity and may therefore be suitable for the generation of bispecific antibodies.",

LAIR1 inserts between the positions 67, 77 and 102 that determined distinct patterns of reactivity with parasite isolates, as well as loss of collagen binding (Fig. 3c) . In contrast, LAIR1 inserted into the switch region carried only a few substitutions, which were however sufficient to abolish collagen binding. In particular, the camel-like antibody MGB47, which had the highest level of amino acid substitutions among those with inserts in the switch region, showed a considerable breadth since it stained 8 out of the 9 parasites tested. Interestingly, we found that unmutated LAIR1 bound to a few isolates when tested at 1 \u03bcg ml -1 and to all parasites when tested at a 100-fold higher concentration (Fig. 3c) . We conclude that the unmutated LAIR1 domain binds with low affinity to most parasite isolates and that mutations can increase affinity and modify the spectrum of cross-reactivity. Furthermore, the finding that collagen binding is lost even in cases where the somatic mutation mechanism is less effective, as in the case of insertions into the switch region, suggests that there is strong pressure to \"redeem\" this BCR from autoreactivity7.",

To ask how generally and how frequently templated DNA sequences are inserted in the switch region, we isolated gDNA from switched memory B cells of European blood donors, amplified the switch regions and sequenced them using the Illumina platform (Extended Data Fig. 4 ). Using a bioinformatics pipeline, we identified templated inserts at a frequency of approximately one in >10 3 B cells, with the length of the inserts ranging from <100 to >1000 nucleotides (Fig. 4a , Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Tables 2-4). Switch region inserts could also be detected using long-read MinION sequencing of intact amplicons, which provided a suitable platform for insert identification, in spite of its high error rate10. Using MinION, we confirmed the identity of several inserts using biological replicates and estimated a higher frequency of templated inserts in the range of one in a few hundred switched memory B cells ( Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6 ). In contrast, no insert was detected in the switch region of na\u00efve B cells (Fig  4c) . Interestingly, most of the inserts were derived from genic regions from all chromosomes and in particular from genes expressed in B cells, such as PAX5 and EBF1 (Fig. 4b ,e,f and Extended Data Fig. 7) . The genic inserts, which account for 75% of all inserts, were derived from introns, exons and, in some cases, comprised an entire exon with preserved splice sites (Fig. 4d) . A fraction of the latter had the correct frame and orientation for the potential expression of an extra protein sequence in the Ig elbow (Extended Data Fig. 8 ). Taken together, the above findings indicate that templated inserts derived from transcribed genes are frequently found in the switch regions of memory B cells.",

However, in spite of their breadth and opsonizing activity2, the presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies did not confer improved protection against febrile malaria (Extended Data Fig. 9 ), a finding that may be explained by the fact that the LAIR1-containing antibodies recognize only a fraction of cultured parasites and may allow the selection of escape mutants. A thorough investigation of the role of the LAIR1-containing antibodies in vivo will require the isolation of autologous parasites from the individuals who possess these antibodies.",

The finding that unmutated LAIR1 has the inherent ability to bind to IEs explains how the insertion of this domain results in the generation of public antibodies with a common specificity. Furthermore, the fact that this domain binds to all parasite isolates tested, albeit with low affinity, suggests a mechanism for the extraordinary clonal expansion and selection of mutated antibody variants with improved affinity and breadth by repeated infections with different P. falciparum parasites. These findings illustrate, in a biologically relevant system, the power of clonal selection driven by both antigen binding and loss of self-reactivity. Furthermore, the binding of IEs to LAIR1 suggests the possibility that the parasite might target this inhibitory receptor to modulate the host immune response.",

Similarly, repair of RAGinduced double-strand breaks during B cell development in the bone marrow may give rise to insertions in the CDR3. Our finding that switch region inserts are derived from transcribed genes suggests an involvement of nascent RNA as an insert template and recent publications have shown that nascent RNA12,13 as well as foreign RNA14,15 can be used to repair double-strand DNA breaks. Furthermore, multiple templated inserts from transcribed genes have been observed in engineered double-strand breaks in a human cell line and mouse pro-B cells14,16. However, we cannot exclude accessible DNA as a primary substrate. The possibility of inducing human na\u00efve B cells to switch in vitro offers an opportunity to study the mechanism of templated insertions and to engineer B cells by manipulating the factors involved in DNA repair and by offering different substrates.

Raw sequences reads were quality-filtered using Metrichor basecaller (https://metrichor.com/s/). 2D reads with a sequence length above 1000bp (or 2000bp depending on the primers used for the amplification) were aligned against GRCh37 human genome assembly with LAST software30 (parameters: last-train and lastal -p ONT_fasta_sequences.par last-split -m1e-6). Then we parsed LAST output and selected reads that contain an insert (minimum 50 bp length), two flanking regions of minimum 100 bp mapping to the switch region (switch locus defined as chr14:106050000-106337000) and allowing a gap of 100 bp maximum between the insert and the switch region. Finally, we merged the insert coordinates of the overlapping inserts with bedtools and annotated the inserts list with GENCODE v1925 using BEDOPS tool26. Scripts are available at MinION and Illumina inserts coordinates were merged with Bedtools (merge command with default parameter). The circular genomic representation of the inserts has been generated using the Circos software31. Switch inserts with genic (intron or exonintron) origin were subjected to an enrichment analysis using EnrichR and the Human Gene Atlas as the gene-set library32,33.",
