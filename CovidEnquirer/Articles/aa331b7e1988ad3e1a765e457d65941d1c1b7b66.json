This hypothesis implies that factors in the environment can determine the initiation of allergic sensitization and can potentially influence the clinical manifestations and severity of disease. Because the prevalence of atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy have increased worldwide in the,past several decades, and there is no mechanism for changes in population genetics over this short period of time, changes in the human environment are most likely responsible for these trends. From this line of reasoning, it follows that if the factors responsible for the increasing prevalence can be identified, then there would be an opportunity to develop strategies to reverse these trends. It also would be helpful to identify infants who are at risk for developing allergy, so that preventive strategies could be used most effectively.",

Furthermore, there appear to be additional factors that influence whether a person born into an atopic family will develop allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, or some combination of these disorders. For example, Dold et a1 found that families that included one parent with atopic dermatitis were more likely to have a child with atopic dermatitis (odds ratio [OR] 3.4) than were families with one parent with either asthma (OR 1.5) or allergic rhinitis (OR 1.4).14 Similar trends were observed when inheritance of asthma or atopic dermatitis was examined, and these findings suggest that there are specific genetic or environmental factors that influence which organ system(s) are affected by allergy.

These activities could have the net effect of biasing the neonatal immune response towards the production of Th-2-like cytokines that could promote allergy. This concept is supported by studies of cytokine production from neonatal T cells, which have generally been found to produce relatively low levels of IFN-y and overproduce Th-2-like cytokines. In addition, if maternal allergy causes a further deviation of the placental immune response towards Th-2-like cytokines, this effect could explain why the risk of developing allergic disease in childhood is more closely related to maternal allergy than to paternal allergy.",

First, several cases have been reported in which young infants have developed allergic reactions upon their first ingestion of a specific food protein. Considering that IgE does not cross the placenta, one potential explanation for this phenomenon is that sensitization in utero via traces of antigenic proteins that circulate in the maternal circulation cross the placenta and sensitize fetal lymphocytes. To test this hypothesis, several studies have been conducted to detect neonatal allergen sensitization. In support of this, Warner et a1 demonstrated allergen-specific proliferative responses in cord blood lymphocytes.99 Although the latter findings suggest that fetal lymphocytes can be activated by allergenic proteins in the maternal circulation, positive responses do not necessarily indicate allergy, and these activated lymphocytes could just as well be cells involved in tolerance. In older children, positive lymphocyte responses to allergens can be found in both allergic and nonallergic individuals and have not been found to be useful discriminators of allergy.

Smoking causes lower birth weights and corresponding reductions in lung size, and small lung size has been identified as a risk factor for wheezing lower respiratory illnesses in infancy.57 In addition to decreasing lung size, in utero exposure to tobacco smoke has been shown to reduce newborn lung function. To measure this effect, techniques have been developed to measure pulmonary function during resting tidal breathing in babies and infants at a very early age. The outcome variable that has been used most often to study the effects of tobacco on infant pulmonary function is the time to peak tidal expiratory flow as a proportion of the total expiratory time (TmF:TE); this index measures slowing of expiration by the combination of glottic narrowing and diaphragmatic tone and is reduced in adults with obstructive airway disease.59 Using these techniques, mild airway obstruction has been detected in infants born to smoking mothers within 3 days of birth, strongly suggesting that smoking causes reduced pulmonary function in the developing fetus.50,85 This concept is further supported by a study of Hoo et a1,% who evaluated pulmonary function prior to discharge in 108 preterm infants, 40 of whom were born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy. In this study, decreased TpTEF:TE was associated with exposure to tobacco smoke in utero, but not birth weight or length, and this relationship persisted in the multivariate analysis. Together, these studies provide compelling evidence that maternal cigarette smoking can harm developing lungs both before and after birth, and these effects are likely to contribute to increasing the risk of developing wheezing with viral infections and chronic asthma.",

Chandra et aI8 prospectively followed 109 infants with allergic siblings.

The intervention consisted of maternal avoidance of milk, egg, and wheat, with limited soy and wheat intake during lactation and breast-feeding. In addition, infants in the intervention group were breast-fed or given a casein hydrolysate formula until 12 months of age. Solid foods were introduced starting at age 6 months, but egg protein was withheld until 24 months of age or older, and peanut and fish were started after 36 months of age. Children in the intervention group had less atopic dermatitis and food allergy at 1 year of age ( Fig. 2) , and allergy to cow's milk was reduced through 2 years of age. By age 7, there were no group-specific differences in the period prevalence of eczema and food allergy. Because of effects before the age of 2 years, the cumulative prevalence of food allergy remained lower at age 7, suggesting that the interventions did more than just delay the onset of food allergy and actually prevented some cases. Notably, changes in the infant diet did not reduce the incidence of allergic rhinitis and asthma by the age of 7 years. Together, these studies indicate that a hypoallergenic diet during lactation and infancy can reduce the prevalence of atopic dermatitis and food allergy in the first year or two of life. Considering the fact that other studies have shown that restricting the maternal diet during pregnancy is not helpful, it is clear that the beneficial effects seen in the studies by Chandra and Zeiger were caused by modifications in the postnatal diet. Although these results are promising, the practical significance of these findings is tempered by the fact that these effects were not of long duration, and the subsequent incidence of respiratory allergy was not affected. The ability to modulate immune responses with infant formula containing nucleotides has recently been of interest-; however, its potential ability to influence the development of allergic diseases in infancy and early childhood has yet to be evaluated. Whether or not breast-feeding can prevent childhood allergy has been debated since the 1930s, when Grulee and Sanfordz2 reported that breast-fed infants were at lower risk for developing asthma compared with infants that were fed cow's milk. Although the numerous studies in the interim have so far failed to resolve this issue,e5 several points are clear. First, because of multiple beneficial effects on growth, development, and the immune system, breast milk is the ideal infant diet98 and should be advocated regardless of the allergic history of the family. Second, food proteins consumed by the mother can be detected in breast milk, and this low level (nanogram quantities) of food protein is sufficient to cause allergen sensitization and to induce allergic symptoms in a subset of allergy-prone infants. Excluding highly allergenic foods such as cow's milk and egg from maternal diet dur$g lactation can reduce the infant's risk of food allergy and eczema and provides a preventive strategy for highly allergic families.",

These observations suggest that there may be a period during the first few months of life in which the immune system is particularly susceptible to developing Th-2-like T-cell responses to certain inhaled allergenic proteins. This concept is especially intriguing when one considers the temporal sequence of this process: The early exposure to allergenic proteins initiates a process that is not clinically evident for several years because pollen allergy is rarely diagnosed until children have reached school age. These findings, along with data derived from experimental models of sensitization in animals, suggest that early exposure to inhaled proteins initiate allergen-specific T-cell responses, but additional elements in the immune system, such as dendritic cells or other antigen-presenting cells, must mature before allergy to these proteins can develop.\" Alternately, the initial allergen-specific T-cell responses may require repeated restimulation, and the intermittent nature of pollen exposure could explain why hay fever takes longer to develop compared with allergy to either foods or perennial inhalants.",

One group of children resided in Munich in the former West Germany, whereas the other group was from Halle, a city in the former East Germany with high levels of air pollution because of the burning of high-sulfur in home furnaces to provide heat. Although the total incidence of respiratory disease was greatest in the group from Halle, asthma and skin test positivity were nearly three times higher in the Munich schoolchildren. This study, like others, indicates that there are factors associated with the Western lifestyle that increase the risk for developing asthma and allergy. Furthermore, pollution did not seem to be associated with greater asthma or allergy. Clearly, air pollution is a complex entity, and it seems likely that individual pollutants may have divergent effects on the risk for developing allergy.

The G (attachment) and F (fusion) proteins are the major surface glycoproteins against which neutralizing antibody is directed. Interestingly, in both murine3 and human38 in vitro experiments, it has been noted that the G protein elicits a predominant Th-2 response, whereas the F protein produces a predominant Th-1 response. In mice, to test the activities of define bronchiolitis. These criteria include the type o Y virus producing the T cells recognizing individual RSV proteins in vivo, virus-specific T-cell lines have been produced using recombinant vaccinia viruses that express either the G or F proteins. Following passive transfer of these cell lines to naive recipients and subsequent intranasal inoculation with RSV virus, mice receiving G-specific cells have more severe illnesses characterized by lung hemorrhage, pulmonary neutrophil recruitment, and intense pulmonary eosinophilia.2 These experiments are of interest based on the adverse clinical response noted in many infants who received a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine and subsequently became infected with RSVQ These intriguing observations regarding RSV and its influence on Th-1 or Th-2 responses have recently been expanded. Roman et al\" evaluated 15 hospitalized infants (1-15 months) with an acute lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV. Compared with control infants, the infected children had a suppression of their IFN--y production and, although IL-4 production was also decreased, the IL-4IIFN-y ratio was sigruficantly increased. Renzi et aln prospectively followed 26 infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis by obtaining blood samples at the time of illness and 5 months later. Compared with age-matched control infants, infected patients had an increased percentage of CD4 + , CD25 + , and CD23 + lymphocytes at the 5-month follow-up. Plasma IL-4 levels, although initially not different from control patients, increased significantly in the infected children 5 months later. Blood lymphocytes, obtained during the time of bronchiolitis, produced less IFN-y in response to IL-2 in children who went on to develop a pattern of recurrent wheezing. Finally, peripheral blood lymphocytes from infants who had persistent wheezing produced more IL-4 in response to Demzatopkagoides farina antigen. Unfortunately, the pattern of cytokine response these infants had prior to infection was not evaluated, again begging the question as to which of the observed results may be cause and which may be effect.",

Clearly, family history of allergy increases the risk of subsequent allergic diseases in children, and this has been demonstrated in several long-term prospective studies conducted in the United States and in Europe.12, 27, lO8 For example, Croner and Kjellman12 conducted a large prospective study in which 1,654 Swedish children were evaluated at birth and followed until the age of 11 years. The cumulative incidence of atopic diseases was 27\"/0 in the group as a whole, but this increased to 43% in children with at least one \"obviously atopic\" parent (positive response to questions regarding atopic dermatitis, urticaria, food allergy, asthma, or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis). In this study, there was no difference in the prevalence of atopic diseases in children of atopic mothers or fathers, although some studies have found that maternal allergy has a greater effect on cord blood IgE levelsz5,39 and the development of asthma.% Many studies have investigated the utility of measuring cord blood IgE as a predictor of allergy in neonates with a positive family history. It has been documented in a number of studies that children with elevated cord blood IgE are at increased risk of developing atopic diseases.1z, 27,108 Finding other markers of atopy, such as increased eosinophils or basophils in nasal secretions, positive skin prick tests to egg protein, or atopic skin changes in infancy is also an indicator of increased risk for the subsequent development of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or other atopic disorders.28, Io7 Unfortunately, many or most children who eventually develop allergic diseases do not have identifiable atopic markers in infancy, and the low sensitivity of these tests makes them unsuitable for screening purposes.",

For example, a history of infantile eczema or a maternal history of atopy have about the same prognostic significance value as an increase in total IgE, and unfortunately, combining these indicators does not increase the predictive value of these measurements.58",

Changes in the prenatal diet do not affect the risk for allergy and are unnecessary. Sensible dietary modifications for babies include breast-feeding, delaying the introduction of solid foods until 6 months of age, and withholding highly allergenic foods such as cow's milk, egg, and peanut for 2 to 3 years. Several formulas in which the protein source has been hydrolyzed to reduce antigenicity are listed in Table 1 . These formulas may be used in a preventive fashion if the mother decides not to breast-feedlW or as alternatives to cow's milk or soy-based formulas after cessation of breast-feeding. Changing from breastmilk to a hypoallergenic formula seems to have little additional value, however, for infants who are breast-fed for longer than 6 months6 Hypoallergenic formulas have the disadvantages of being more costly than standard infant formulas and have a strong taste that some infants find unpalatable, especially if the infant was initially fed breastmilk. In infants older than 6 months of age, alternatives to hypoallergenic formulas include vitamin D and calcium-fortified rice milk or orange juice,. and these beverages are available in many health food stores and supermarkets.",
