However, its general application has been hampered by difficulty in identifying a specific ligand-responsive pseudoknot that also functions as a ligand-dependent -1 PRF stimulator. We addressed this problem by using the \u22121 PRF stimulation pseudoknot of SARS-CoV (SARS-PK) to build a ligand-dependent \u22121 PRF stimulator. In particular, the extra stem of SARS-PK was replaced by an RNA aptamer of theophylline and designed to couple theophylline binding with the stimulation of \u22121 PRF. Conformational and functional analyses indicate that the engineered theophylline-responsive RNA functions as a mammalian riboswitch with robust theophyllinedependent \u22121 PRF stimulation activity in a stable human 293T cell-line. Thus, RNA-ligand interaction repertoire provided by in vitro selection becomes accessible to ligand-specific \u22121 PRF stimulator engineering using SARS-PK as the scaffold for synthetic biology application.",

The \u22121 PRF involves the backward movement of an elongating ribosome by one nucleotide relative to the decoding reading-frame. It leads to a switch of the decoding process into a \u22121 reading-frame to generate a protein with its C-terminal domain composition being determined by the new reading-frame. It has been adopted in a variety of viruses to control the ratio between viral proteins crucial for optimal propagation via instrumental frameshifting efficiency (10, 11) . \u22121 PRF occurs on a shifty sequence with a low basal efficiency and can be further enhanced by an RNA structure optimally positioned downstream of the shifty sequence (12) . The downstream RNA structure is usually an H-type pseudoknot (13) composed of an RNA hairpin with its loop sequences pairing with complementary sequences downstream of the hairpin stem (stem 1) to form a second duplex (stem 2). Given the critical role of a downstream stimulator in the efficiency of eukaryotic \u22121 PRF, the ability to modulate stimulator conformation formation by a ligand-binding RNA aptamer could result in a ligand-responsive \u22121 PRF stimulator. However, only a subset of the H-type pseudoknot can stimulate \u22121 PRF efficiently.",

All reactions were terminated by adding gel loading buffer (95% Formamide, 18 mM EDTA, 0.025% SDS, 0.025% Xylene Cyanol, 0.025% Bromophenol Blue). Spontaneous RNA cleavage products from in-line probing assays and related markers were separated by 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exposed to a phosphorimager screen after drying of the gels. The phosphorimager screen was scanned by Typhoon FLA 7000 phosphorimager (GE) and the radioactivity of spontaneous RNA-cleavage products was analyzed and quantified by ImageQuantTL software. For loading difference calibration, the quantified intensity values of the cleavage-bands of interest were normalized against value of a band corresponding to residue G13416 of the same lane.",

The purified capped reporter mRNA (100 ng) was used in a 5 l in vitro translation reaction containing 2.55 l rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 0.25 l of translation buffer, 0.1 l of RNase inhibitor (40 U/l), 0.1 l of 10 Ci/ l [ 35 S]-labeled methionine (NEN) and 1 l of theophylline of varied concentrations. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 \u2022 C for 1.5 h, and then loaded into 12% sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gels for electrophoresis analysis. The gels were exposed to a phosphorimager screen after drying and the radioactivity of translated products analyzed. The radioactivity of protein products was calibrated with the methionine content of each protein product. Estimated frameshifting efficiency was calculated by dividing calibrated radioactive intensity of full-length shifted protein products by the sum of calibrated radioactive intensity of full-length shifted and non-shifted protein products. Because translation products due to ribosome drop-off in the \u22121 frame (radioactivity detectable or non-detectable) were difficult for accurate measurement as well as methionine calibration, they were not included in the calculation and would lead to underestimation of frameshifting efficiency. By assuming similar extent of drop-off tendency, we present the effect of theophylline on radioactivity-based \u22121 PRF activity in terms of relative \u22121 PRF so that the ribosome drop-off effect can be filtered out (23) . Dual luciferase activity was measured from in vitro translation reactions (without addition of labeled methionine) or lysates of reporter transfected cells for frameshifting efficiency calculations by Dual Luciferase TM reporter assay (Promega) following manufacturer's instructions on a CHAMELEON TM multi-label plate reader (HIDEX). Dual-luciferase based frameshifting efficiency of a specific construct was calculated according to previously described procedures (23) by comparison with a corresponding read-through control assuming that similar extent of ribosome drop-off occured during translation. Each read-through control has the TTTAAAC slippery sequence replaced by a CTTAAGAA sequence that disrupts the slippery site and shifts the reading frame to \u22121 frame by one extra nucleotide insertion. Unless specified, these readthrough controls (listed in Supplementary Table S1) were used for calibration in frameshifting activity calculation.",

A theophylline aptamer was used due to theophylline's cell permeability (33) and the well-characterized structural features of the aptamer (34) . The ligand-binding pocket of theophylline aptamer is composed of an internal-loop and an adjacent bulge with conserved key theophyllinecontact sequences distributed within the two motifs. Each motif is connected to duplex regions that serve as the carrier of the binding-pocket ( Figure 1A and C). Importantly, the conservation of primary sequences in the terminal duplex (the 'lower stem' in Figure 1A ) that closes the internal-loop is not absolutely required as long as basepairing complementarity of the duplex is maintained (35) . This feature thus provides flexibility in designing a liganddependent conformational switch. The \u22121 PRF activity of Switch-0 placed downstream of a slippery sequence is one third that of SARS-PK based on in vitro frameshifting assays performed in reticulocyte lysate. Furthermore, the \u22121 PRF efficiencies of both SARS-PK and Switch-0 remained virtually unchanged with or without 1 mM theophylline treatment (Supplementary Figure S1A-D) . However, results from in-line probing analysis of Switch-0 RNA (Figure 2A) indicated that the embedded theophylline aptamer remained theophylline binding competent (Supplementary Figure S1E) . Therefore, Switch-0 represents an ideal starting framework to build a theophylline-dependent \u22121 PRF stimulator.",

            "text": "Recent simulation studies have indicated that the stabilities of constituent secondary structures determined the folding of RNA pseudoknots (36) . This means, interference of the folding of stem 1 or stem 2 of a pseudoknot to affect pseudoknot formation could be controlled by a designed secondary structural element within the pseudoknot. As the 3 -side of pseudoknot stem 2 as well as that of the embedded theophylline aptamer in Switch-0 is bridged by UCU tri-nucleotides, we reasoned that a theophylline-responsive \u22121 PRF stimulator (Switch-1) could be constructed by coupling stem 2 formation with theophylline-binding pocket formation ( Figure 1B and D) . This was achieved by designing sequences flanking UCU to form a stable hairpin, while maintaining base pairing of the lower stem in the theophylline-bound aptamer ( Figure 1D ). We rationalized that such an engineered switch hairpin of reasonable stability (predicted free energy of \u221212.7 kcal/mole (37)) would be the dominant conformation that could interfere with the formation of pseudoknot stem 2 in the absence of theophylline (Supplementary Figure S2A) . As it is difficult to measure the free energy contribution of stem 2 formation, we mimicked it by a hairpin of UCU loop closed by the stem 2 (36) with a predicted free energy of \u22127.0 kcal/mole (Supplementary Figure S2B) . By contrast, the addition of theophylline could interfere with switch hairpin formation via theophylline aptamer stabilization and help release the trapped 3 -side of stem 2 to facilitate stem 2 pairing for generation of a pseudoknot. In the design of Switch-1, only the eight nucleotides constituting its lower aptamer stem are different from those of Switch-0 ( Figure 1C and D) .",

RibonucleaseV1 cleavages corresponding to the 3 -side of stem 1 for both free and theophylline-bound RNAs were in agreement with formation of stem 1 under both conditions for Switch-0 and Switch-1. Furthermore, V1 cleavage signals also occurred in the 5 -side of the upper stems of the aptamer domains but were reduced in the presence of theophylline in both Switch-0 and Switch-1, suggesting ligand-dependent rearrangement in the regions proximal to the binding-pockets. Consistent with these, reduced ribonu-cleaseT2 cleavage signals were also observed in bindingrelated nucleotides downstream of the upper stem upon theophylline treatment for both RNAs. However, major differences in T2 cleavage patterns between Switch-0 and Switch-1 appeared in the sequences covering 5 -sides of both binding pocket and lower stem of the aptamer domains, although the sequences forming binding-pockets are identical between the two RNAs. Furthermore, prominent T2 cleavages in these sequences observed for Switch-1 were reduced upon theophylline treatment and are consistent with theophylline-induced aptamer stabilization for Switch-1. Importantly, T2 cleavages also appeared in the stemloop junction of stem 1 in Switch-1 in the absence of theophylline, and were greatly reduced upon theophylline treatment. No similar T2 cleavage occurred in the corresponding Left OH \u2212 , A and T1 lanes represent denatured condition sequence markers corresponding to alkaline hydrolysis ladder, C/U residues-specific cut by RNase A and G residues-specific cut by RNase T1, respectively. Right T2, V1 and T1 lanes represent limited ribonuclease digestion by corresponding ribonuclease alone (\u2212) or in the presence of either 1 mM theophylline (Theo) or 1 mM caffeine (Caf). Sequences corresponding to the 5 -side of stem 2, 5 -sides of lower aptamer stem/binding pocket and 3 -sides of binding pocket/lower aptamer stem are typed in the left from down to top (from 5 to 3 direction). Sequences identical between Switch-0 and Switch-1 are typed in capital, while the eight nucleotides different between them are typed in lower case. The predicted secondary structural elements along primary sequences are labeled in the right. Signals with reduced T2 and V1 cleavages in the presence of 1 mM theophylline are annotated by open and filled circle, respectively. region of Switch-0. Because these sequences constitute the 5 -side of stem 2 and are identical in both RNAs, these results are consistent with theophylline-induced formation of stem 2 in Switch-1. Together, these probing data are consistent with the existence of a theophylline-triggered conformation switch that leads to the formation of a pseudoknot.",

We first stabilized the switch hairpin of Switch-1 by engineering two extra GC base pairs in the terminal end of the switch stem to form a Switch-lock construct (Supplementary Figure S5A) and found that it possessed low \u22121 PRF activity in theophylline (Supplementary Figure S5B-D) . This is consistent with the stabilized switch hairpin (predicted free-energy of \u221217.6 kcal/mole) being locked even in the presence of theophylline. Switch-2 was then designed by removing 3 base pairs from lower aptamer stem of the ligand-bound Switch-1. It resulted in three base pairs disruption in the upper stem of switch hairpin in the free form of Switch-2 (compare Figure 1D with Supplementary Figure S5A) . This was done with the assumption that the destabilized switch hairpin (predicted free-energy of \u22128.6 kcal/mole) could still compete with the formation of a pseudoknot stem 2 without theophylline, while binding of theophylline would facilitate stem 2 formation. Switch-2 possessed 4-fold increase in \u22121 PRF stimulation in response to 1 mM theophylline (Supplementary Figure S5B-D) . Furthermore, the dynamic range was increased to 6-fold in the presence of 2 mM theophylline, whereas the dynamic range of Switch-1 did not increase further (Supplementary Figure S5C) . In-line probing analysis of Switch-2 RNA indicated similar theophyllinedependent RNA hydrolysis patterns as those of Switch-1 RNA in ligand-binding-pockets and 5 -side sequences of stem 2 (Supplement Figure S6A and B) . A Kd value of 10folds higher than that of Switch-1 RNA (Supplement Figure S6C) helps explain higher theophylline concentration requirement to activate \u22121 PRF stimulation efficiency of Switch-2. However, experiments showed that Switch-2 behaves similarly to Switch-1 in 293T cells (data not shown), indicating a missing link between in vitro and cellular experiments.",

Recently, we have identified RNA hairpins upstream of a frameshifting site as a negative regulator of \u22121 PRF (40) and demonstrated that \u22121 PRF activity can be regulated by ligand-induced conformational rearrangements of this upstream attenuator (24) . To improve the dynamic range of ligand response and to see if theophylline aptamers can be functional while existing in both positive and negative regulators of \u22121 PRF, we fused previously designed theophylline-dependent upstream attenuator, theoOFF2 (24) with Switch-1 ( Figure 5A ) and examined theophylline-dependent \u22121 PRF activity in vitro. For comparison, a construct with an upstream theoOFF2 and a downstream SARS-PK was also generated. We found that the upstream theoOFF2 regulated \u22121 PRF stimulated by downstream SARS-PK in a theophylline-dependent way with a dynamic range better than that of Switch-1 (Figure 5B and C) . Furthermore, a 6-to 8-folds increase in in vitro \u22121 PRF stimulation was observed in the theoOFF2-Switch1 construct when theophylline was increased to 1 mM ( Figure 5C ), suggesting the existence of a synergetic ef-fect for theophylline-dependent \u22121 PRF stimulation. However, this dynamic range was reduced to 5-fold in 293T cells transfected with the theoOFF2-Switch1 construct ( Figure  5D ). Further analysis suggests that this was due to the reduced dynamic range of theoOFF2 in 293T cells because the dynamic range of Switch-1 remained virtually the same under both conditions ( Figure 5C and D) . Thus, the use of the same ligand-binding aptamer in both upstream attenuator and downstream stimulator result in further enhancement of ligand-responsiveness for \u22121 PRF activity regulation.",

Consistently, elevated fulllength fluorescent protein expression was induced by theophylline treatment, whereas the construct of read-through control (theoOFF2-RFC1) expressed constitutively ( Figure  5E and F). Importantly, these transiently expressed results indicate that a combination of theoOFF2 and Switch-1 provides tighter theophylline-dependent regulation of \u22121 PRF compared with theoOFF2 alone (Figure 5E and F) . Finally, a stable cell-line (293T-theo1) harboring a split fluorescent reporter gene embedded with theoOFF2-Switch1 was established via a PiggBac-based approach (25) with the transcription of reporter mRNA controlled by tetracycline. We found that prominent Venus activity could be observed in the presence of both theophylline and tetracycline ( Figure  6A and B), whereas low Venus activity existed in the absence of theophylline. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the engineered theophylline-responsive \u22121 PRF stimulator is robust and compatible with existing tools to build a regulatory circuit in the 293T human cell-line.",

Here, we present concepts and designs in using SARS-CoV \u22121 PRF pseudoknot stimulator as the framework to rationally building a ligand-dependent stimulator for mammalian application. Notably, we demonstrated that the extra stem of this IBV-type pseudoknot variant can be replaced by an RNA aptamer to provide a general approach for building a ligand-responsive pseudoknot and a liganddependent \u22121 PRF stimulator simultaneously. This engineered mammalian riboswitch possesses activity that rivals metabolite-responsive and viral \u22121 PRF stimulators, with potential for further improvement by adding intermolecular kissing interaction to the terminal loop of aptamer. Finally, ligand-dependency of the mammalian riboswitch engineered in this study could be swapped to other ligands by starting from replacing the extra stem of SARS-PK with other aptamer domains. In the left side of arrow, the attenuator hairpin (in red) of theoOFF2 is ON to attenuate \u22121 PRF without theophylline. However, the attenuator hairpin is switched off upon theophylline treatment in the right. As the ON and OFF switches of Switch-1 respond in an opposite way to theophylline treatment, the ON switch-1 and OFF theoOFF2 result in synergistic up-regulation of \u22121 PRF activity in the presence of theophylline. (B) 12% SDS-PAGE analysis of radioactivity-based \u22121 PRF activity of an upstream attenuator module (theoOFF2) in combination with different downstream stimulators in reticulocyte lysate. \u22121 PRF activities of p2luc reporters containing theoOFF2-SARSPK, Switch-1 and theoOFF2-Switch1 under different ligand conditions are shown with 0 and \u22121 frame products annotated. theoOFF2-RFC1 and theoOFF2-ZFC1 represent read-through and 0-frame product controls of theoOFF2-Switch1, respectively. (C) Relative \u22121 PRF activity of reporter constructs in (B) in reticulocyte lysate with the ligand-free activity being treated as 1 (in gray). \u22121 PRF efficiency was calculated from dual-luciferase activity calibrated by using theoOFF2-RFC and theoOFF2-RFC1 as the read-through controls of theoOFF2-SARS and theoOFF2-Switch1, respectively. Value for each bar is the mean of seven independent experiments with standard error of the mean. P-values were determined by a Student's t-test with P-value < 0.05 designated by an '*'.

Indeed, further destabilizing the switch hairpin in Switch-1 led to improvement in ligand responsiveness of Switch-2 in vitro. However, this improvement might be due to reasons other than the original design. In particular, design in Switch-2 could disrupt potential stacking between stem 1 and the lower aptamer stem in the absence of theophylline (see Figure 1D for a predicted secondary structure model), leading to reduced basal frameshifting activity and improved dynamic range. Additionally, this design could also reduce the base-pairing number of the lower aptamer stem in the presence of theophylline thereby affecting theophylline-binding affinity (35) , and raising the concentration of theophylline required to fully stabilize aptamer conformation. Consistently, increased spontaneous RNA hydrolysis bands appeared in the lower aptamer stem of Switch-2 RNA in higher theophylline concentration (Supplement Figure S6A and B), whereas no theophyllinedependent in-line cleavage in corresponding regions of Switch-1 RNA (Figure 2 and Supplement Figure S3 ). Finally, we observed a gap between in vitro and cellular results for Switch-2. As the theophylline-dependent activation ranges for Switch-1 were well-conserved between in vitro translation and 293T cells, this made it possible to predict that the discrepancy observed in Switch-2 could be caused by the six nucleotides removed from Switch-1. The predicted free energy for the switch hairpin of Switch-2 (\u22128.6 kcal/mole) suggests it could be unstable under cell culturing conditions (37 \u2022 C). By contrast, the switch hairpin (predicted free energy of \u221212.7 kcal/mole) in Switch-1 should populate significantly at both 30 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C. A more comprehensive analysis in energy contribution from the formation of stem 2 as well as from theophylline binding would also be required to address this problem. It will be interesting to see if Switch-2 retains its dynamic range in other eukaryotic systems requiring habitation temperatures lower than 37 \u2022 C.",

However, the upstream attenuator seems to have reduced regulatory activity in cells and may be related to its different attenuation activities toward distinct downstream stimulators as observed previously (24) . Nevertheless, combining these two opposite regulators of \u22121 PRF helps further enhance the dynamic range of theophyllineresponsiveness both in vitro and in cells. Importantly, given that the only difference between the two aptamers used in theoOFF2 and Switch-1 is the base-pairing composition of their lower stems, this suggests that the same ligand can synergistically control a set of negative and positive \u22121 PRF regulators harboring homologous aptamers. Finally, the successful usage of polypeptides encoded by these regula-tory \u22121 PRF modules to create fused functional Venus proteins suggests that the modules can be inserted as a linker to bridge the coding sequences of two independent domains of a protein (such as the substrate-binding and catalytic domains of a specific enzyme) for regulation application.",

This suggests that the artificial mammalian riboswitch needs to be fully bound by the ligand to effectively stimulate \u22121 PRF and is consistent with the theophylline concentration required to fully saturate Switch-1 RNA in affinity measurement plot (Supplement Figure  S2C ). By contrast, the higher concentration required in cellular condition could be due to the cellular uptake efficiency of theophylline and reduced theophylline-binding affinity of Switch-1 at 37 \u2022 C. Indeed, studies in bacterial riboswitch regulation of transcription termination also indicated that much higher metabolite concentration is required to observe effective transcription termination in vitro (41) because a riboswitch is composed of an aptamer and an RNAbased gene expression platform. Thus, effective ligand concentration required for gene expression regulation in both bacterial and mammalian riboswitches is much higher than the Kd value that saturates 50% of its receptor, and could be varied to different extents due to the involvement of different expression platforms.",
