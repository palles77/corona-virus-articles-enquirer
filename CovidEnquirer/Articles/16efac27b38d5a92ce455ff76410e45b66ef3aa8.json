            "text": "Aim: To describe a hospital outbreak of influenza B virus (InfB) infection during season 2015/2016 by combining clinical and epidemiological data with molecular methods. Methods: Twenty patients diagnosed with InfB from a hospital outbreak over a four-weekperiod were included. Nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) positive for InfB by multiplex realtime polymerase chain reaction were sent for lineage typing and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Medical records were reviewed retrospectively for data regarding patient characteristics, localization, exposure and outcome, and assembled into a timeline. In order to find possible connections to the hospital outbreak, all patients with a positive NPS for influenza from the region over an extended time period were also reviewed. Findings: All 20 cases of InfB were of subtype B/Yamagata, and 17 of 20 patients could be linked to each other by either shared room or shared ward. WGS was successful or partially successful for 15 of the 17 viral isolates, and corroborated the epidemiological link supporting a close relationship. In the main affected ward, 19 of 75 inpatients were infected with InfB during the outbreak period, resulting in an attack rate of 25%. One probable case of influenza-related death was identified. Conclusion: InfB may spread within an acute care hospital, and advanced molecular methods may facilitate assessment of the source and extent of the outbreak. A multifaceted approach, including rapid diagnosis, early recognition of outbreak situations, simple rules for patient management and the use of regular infection control measures, may prevent nosocomial transmission of influenza virus.",

Hospital outbreaks of influenza A have been described [1e3] . Patients, visitors and healthcare workers (HCWs) might be part of the transmission chain, and outbreaks may be facilitated within closed settings [4] , possibly by contamination of hospital surfaces [5] . The relative importance of different modes of transmission is contentious; however, aerosol is suggested to be an important factor [6e8] . The epidemiological understanding of influenza transmission in healthcare settings is incomplete due to variations in case identification, source and route of transmission, patient-related factors, and the use of infection control measures. Outbreak reports of influenza from long-term care facilities have been of particular concern due to the high-risk population, but reports using laboratory confirmation combined with accurate clinical definitions have been rare [9] . Molecular characterization has commonly shown multiple viral strains during hospital outbreaks, reflecting simultaneous circulation of various strains in the community rather than hospital clustering [10, 11] . Prevention and control strategies are essential in controlling hospital outbreaks, as well as defining the onset and end of influenza seasons in the community [12] . Properly designed studies are needed to optimize preventive measures [13] .",

Whole genome sequencing has yielded insights into transmission dynamics in nosocomial outbreaks for other agents (e.g. carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae [17] ) and community outbreaks of influenza A [18] . To the authors' knowledge, there have been no reports of hospital outbreaks including a detailed molecular characterization of InfB.

Group 3 consisted of four viruses with two positions where the same nucleotide variations were observed for all isolates. Additional variations were also found in three of the isolates. A putative transmission map was created using nucleotide and patient data in relation to time and location within the hospital ( Figure 3B ). For Case 4, Case 10 and HCWs, no transmission could be supported by sequence analysis due to lack of data. The transmission map generated by integrating nucleotide analysis and epidemiological data highlights the complexity of the outbreak progression. Three putative transmission events stemmed from the index patient, and two secondary transmission events subsequently stemmed from Cases 8 and 3, which likely resulted in six additional infections. Transmission from Case 3 to Case 11 eventually resulted in transmission to another three patients, according to the generated map, before the outbreak came to a halt.

HCWs tend to work despite mild respiratory symptoms, increasing the exposure of co-workers and patients to influenza [29] . It has been shown that the highest number of contacts in hospital care occurs between nurses, or between nurses and patients, which highlights the role of HCWs in nosocomial influenza transmission [30] . Analysis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Beijing identified a high number of close contacts, misdiagnosis and overcrowding as risk factors for 'superspreading' in a hospital setting [31] . Intrahospital transfer of patients with suspected influenza within or between wards may be counterproductive, and may increase the number of exposed individuals. This is illustrated in this study by Case 8, who was re-admitted to another ward despite recent exposure, resulting in Cases 14 and 17. In some cases, the coverage was <20X for some nucleotide positions, which were therefore not analysed for variants. Information regarding the identity of respective nucleotide alteration can be found in Table A (see  online supplementary Defining a patient as exposed to influenza may be difficult, especially when HCWs may be involved. The total number of infectious individuals in a hospital unit might increase the overall risk of exposure. In the present study, seven cases of influenza were diagnosed in patients who did not share a room with a confirmed case. To estimate the number of exposed patients demands knowledge of local conditions, patient transfer patterns within a facility, and individual assessment of infectivity. Access to isolation facilities is, as in the present study, often limited. Patients and HCWs might also be exposed to influenza virus in public areas outside patient rooms, such as corridors, elevators and waiting rooms.",

In outbreak reports from long-term care facilities, attack rates for influenza (A and B) ranges between 1% and 65%, with an adjusted mean of 28%; however, the attack rate of InfB is commonly lower than for influenza A [9] . It has also been hypothesized that elderly people are particularly vulnerable to the Yamagata lineage [32] . The short incubation period might also lead to underestimation of nosocomial transmission rates. In this study, five patients did not meet the defined criteria for an HCAI (Cases 0, 8, 12, 15 and 19) , although the results strongly suggest that Cases 8 and 19 had a hospital-acquired influenza infection. Chemoprophylaxis for exposed individuals may reduce attack rates and shorten outbreak durations [33, 34] , and oseltamivir used for both treatment and prophylaxis has been shown to be more effective than treatment alone [35] . When nosocomial transmission is suspected, it might be useful to provide extended and prolonged prophylaxis, which is probably easier to implement than coherent social distancing. However, oseltamivir seems to be less effective for InfB than for influenza A regarding fever duration and virus persistence [36, 37] , which may have influenced the course of the outbreak reported here.",

            "text": "It is difficult to make an aetiologic diagnosis of ARI based on the clinical presentation alone [38] . Also, low suspicion of influenza outside the ordinary season may have delayed the recognition of InfB cases in this study. To what extent HCWs and patients followed the recommended infection control measures is unknown. An outbreak was not suspected until Day 13, when seven cases had already been confirmed. Risk perception may promote protective behaviour [39] , and no onward transmission could be demonstrated for Cases 12 and 15 (diagnosed on two different wards on Days 15 and 16) when the vigilance of influenza was high throughout the hospital. Additional infection control measures were introduced on Days 13 and 16, but most likely had limited impact as the number of susceptible individuals decreased continuously. This report has several limitations. Unknown factors may have affected the course of the outbreak. Data were collected retrospectively and this may have generated bias. Detailed contact patterns for the infected patients (i.e. shared room for short time periods) could not be established. The HCWs' part of the transmission chain is unclear as information regarding symptoms, laboratory confirmation and adherence to control measures was lacking. Sequence data were only partially complete for Case 3, and were lacking for Cases 4 and 10, making the putative transmission map incomplete. The total number of InfB cases may have been underestimated as asymptomatic patients not meeting the definition of a probable case were not included. There may also be unknown patients, discharged during the outbreak, who contracted InfB on the ward but did not seek further medical care. Patient data regarding vaccination are also lacking. Vaccination coverage for influenza in age group >65 years in Sweden was estimated to be 50% in season 2015/16. However, the protective effect of the vaccine in this study is probably of limited importance due to late seasonal onset and waning immunity.",
