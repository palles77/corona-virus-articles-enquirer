With a longitudinal study we relate changes in national IHR core capacities to changes in cross-border infectious disease threat events (IDTE) between 2010 and 2016, collected through epidemic intelligence at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). By combining all IHR core capacities into one composite measure we found that a 10% increase in the mean of this composite IHR core capacity to be associated with a 19% decrease (p = 0.017) in the incidence of cross-border IDTE in the EU.",

In contrast, our analysis showed that IHR core capacities relating to point-of-entry, zoonotic events or food safety were not associated with IDTE in the EU. Due to high internal correlations between core capacities, we conducted a principal component analysis which confirmed a 20% decrease in risk of IDTE for every 10% increase in the core capacity score (95% CI: 0.73, 0.88). Globally (EU excluded), a 10% increase in the mean of all IHR core capacities combined was associated with a 14% decrease (p = 0.077) in cross-border IDTE incidence. We provide quantitative evidence that improvements in IHR core capacities at country-level are associated with fewer cross-border IDTE in the EU, which may also hold true for other parts of the world.",

It includes developing public health emergency response plans, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and emergency operation centres (EOCs) and ensuring the availability of resources such as stocks of vaccines. For example, IDTE associated with influenza, such as the avian influenza A (H5N1) outbreaks and the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, have created the need to stockpile vaccines. Advancing preparedness measures can increase the systemic resilience against IDTE. For example, the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria in 2014 was quickly detected and contained, in part due to adherence to public health emergency management (PHEM) principles (Frieden & Damon, 2015; Shuaib et al., 2014). Risk communication (core capacity 6) focuses on the dissemination of information to the public about the health risks of a crossborder IDTE. It needs to be tailored to the social, religious, cultural, political and economic profile of the affected population and to promote appropriate prevention and control interventions as our analysis indicates. Strengthening the skills and competencies of public health personnel (core capacity 7) is critical for surveillance and an effective response to cross-border IDTE.(Balajee et al., 2016; Wolicki et al., 2016) Having a trained epidemiologic workforce enables risk assessments to be translated rapidly into public health interventions in order to avert a full-blown cross-border IDTE. Laboratory services (core capacity 8) are central to the early detection, investigation and response to epidemic events (prior to the spread of a cross-border IDTE) and this capacity was highly significant in our analysis. Laboratory capacity for outbreaks requires effective diagnostics, quality assurance, sample referral, biosafety and laboratory management systems (Albiger, Revez, Leitmeyer, & Struelens, 2018).

We used R 3.4 (Anonymous, 2014) and SAS 9.4 (the PROC GENMOD procedure) statistical softwares for data management and analysis. We present estimates of incidence rate of cross-border IDTE for a 10% increase in each IHR core capacity (scale: 0%-100%). For the combined contribution of different IHR core capacities, it was not possible to perform a multivariate regression, due to high internal correlations. Instead, we conducted analysis of a composite indicator of the mean core capacity and additionally ran a principal component analysis for the 11 capacities(Table 1). The principal component analysis (PCA) reduced the dimensionality of the IHR core capacities by making linear combinations and can be used instead of studying individual capacities, for example, in situations of collinearity. The component scores were normalized in order to be comparable to the original core component scales (0%-100%) in the univariate analysis. We performed the same Poisson regression analysis using the PCA scores as predictor variables of the risk for cross-border IDTE, to study the combined effect of core capacities.",

This temporal association indicates that IHR core capacities are necessary and sufficient to prevent, detect and respond to crossborder IDTE and thus contribute to health security. This analysis of EU data indicates that IHR core capacities capture relevant public health measures for the prevention of cross-border IDTE and that improvement in these core capacities is associated with a reduction in the incidence of cross-border IDTE. Strengthening IHR core capacities could further counteract the emergence and re-emergence of cross-border IDTE in Europe.

This association is important in view of competing demands for limited public health resources that pitches preparedness planning versus other dire public health needs. Advancing pandemic preparedness and response, upgrading public health systems, and research and development in low-and middle-income countries is projected to cost $4.5 billion per year(Sands, Mundaca-Shah, et al., 2016). Our analysis suggests that IHR core capacities capture the foundations of preparedness and that IHR deficiencies are therefore operational rather than structural. In 2014, the IHR Review Committee highlighted the need to: strengthen self-assessment; test capacities through simulations; promote regional and cross-regional learning; and measure performance through peer-review and external assessments(World Health Organisation, 2015). Our study can guide preparedness measures in Europe and elsewhere for the prevention of IDTE as, ultimately, health security depends on transparent implementation of IHR core capacities and shared accountability in an interconnected and interdependent world. IHR core capacity implementation can advance systemic resilience to cross-border IDTE in Europe.",
