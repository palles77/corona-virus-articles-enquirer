We found that GL treatment leads to a clear reduction in the number of IAV-infected human lung cells as well as a reduction in the CCID50 titer by 90%. The antiviral effect, however, was limited to one or two virus replication cycles. Analysis of different GL treatment protocols suggested that the antiviral effect of GL was limited to an early step in the virus replication cycle. A direct inhibitory action of GL on IAV particles could be excluded and GL did not interact with virus receptor binding either. The antiviral effect of GL was abolished by treatment 1 h after virus infection, whereas pre-treatment and treatment during and after virus adsorption led to a reduction in the cytopathic effect, reduced viral RNA within the cells and in the cell supernatants, and reduced viral hemagglutination titers. Detailed virus uptake analyses unambiguously demonstrated reduced virus uptake in various GL-treated cells. These observations lead to the conclusion, that the antiviral activity of GL is mediated by an interaction with the cell membrane which most likely results in reduced endocytotic activity and hence reduced virus uptake. These insights might help in the design of structurally related compounds leading to potent anti-influenza therapeutics.",

            "text": "Viral respiratory infections are the most common diseases experienced by people of all ages. Influenza A virus (IAV) is considered to be a major human pathogen and can cause between 3 and 5 million cases of severe illness in a normal season and up to 500,000 deaths worldwide (WHO, 2003) . Pandemic outbreaks such as those that occurred in 1918, 1957, and 1968 resulted in high mortality rates mainly due to the lack of pre-existing immunity against the new virus strain (Horimoto and Kawaoka, 2005) . Currently there are only two classes of U.S.FDA-approved antiviral drugs available for the treatment and prevention of influenza: the adamantane derivatives (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs; zanamivir and oseltamivir) (Nicholson et al., 2003) . The targets of both types of drugs are viral proteins and for optimum efficacy they must be administered within 48 h of symptom onset. The adamantanes are specific for influenza A virus, and block the function of the viral ion channel protein, thereby inhibiting virus uncoating upon infection (Davies et al., 1964) . NAIs block the enzymatic activity of the viral neuraminidase (NA) preventing the release of virions after budding from the host cell (Colman et al., 1983) . Zanamivir and oseltamivir are currently prescribed for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza and are being stockpiled for pandemic influenza. Besides these two major groups of antiinfluenza drugs, several other approaches including inhibitors of viral RNA transcription, small interfering RNA, inhibitors of virus-cell fusion or proteolytic processing of HA exist, but so far no alternative drug has been licensed (Lagoja and De Clercq, 2008) . Hence, there is a need and a market for new antiviral drugs.",

Both compounds are reported to have antitumor, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties (Shibata et al., 2000) . The mechanism of how GL exerts these various effects still remains unclear. GL is active against a broad spectrum of viruses, including herpes-, corona-, alpha-, and flaviviruses, human immunodeficiency virus, vaccinia, polio type I, vesicular stomatitis virus, and IAV (Briolant et al., 2004; Cinatl et al., 2003; Crance et al., 2003; Hoever et al., 2005; Lampi et al., 2001; Lin, 2003; Pompei et al., 1979 Pompei et al., , 1983 Sasaki et al., 2003; Takei et al., 2005; Utsunomiya et al., 1997) .

Thus, virus and hRBC, respectively, were incubated with PBS or GL (1 and 0.5 mM) for 2 h at room temperature and HA titers were determined (Table 2) . No difference of GL-treated virus or GL-treated hRBC to PBS treatment was detected on HA titers leading to the conclusion that GL does not inhibit virus binding to its receptor. In addition, inhibition of neuraminidase activity by GL was evaluated using the 2 -(4-methylumbelliferyl)-a-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid substrate conversion assay (Wetherall et al., 2003) and no effect was observed either (data not shown).",

The different treatment protocols are depicted in Fig. 4A . Arrows indicate the presence of the drug on the cells before, during, and after virus infection, respectively. Cell viability (Fig. 4B ) and HA titers (Table 3) were determined at 40 h post-infection, virus transcripts in the supernatant ( Fig. 4C and D) were analyzed at 24 and 40 h post-infection. Compared to infection without synchronization (Fig. 2) , the effects observed appear delayed by approximately 16-24 h which is most probably due to the fact that cell metabolism is temporarily shut down during cooling for synchronization. At 24 and 40 h post-infection, clear differences between the various treatment protocols were observed: pre-incubation of the cells with GL before and/or at virus adsorption and removal of it thereafter improved cell viability only slightly but significantly by 2.4-and 2.6-fold (p < 0.01) for treatments A and Table 3 Hemagglutination titers of cell supernatants after IAV infection and different GL (1 mM) treatment protocols; n = 3; median (interquartile range). Cell viabilities and viral RNA in cell supernatants were compared to untreated. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and a one value was excluded due to an operational error. B, respectively, compared to untreated cells at 40 h post-infection (Fig. 4B) . Correspondingly, the amount of virus RNA in the cell supernatants of treatment A is reduced slightly (50%, p < 0.05) at 24 h post-infection which disappears again after 40 h. A notable but not significant reduction was also observed for treatment B (Fig. 4C,  24 h) . Moreover, the positive effect on cell viability resulting from GL pre-treatment is also evident in treatment F when compared to E (Fig. 4B) . These weak effects, however, were not apparent from the in HA titers (Table 3) which is most likely due to insufficient resolving power of the assay. Interestingly, when GL was present only during virus adsorption (treatment C), no effect on cell viability (Fig. 4B ), viral RNA (Fig. 4C) , and HA titers (Table 3) compared to untreated was detected. These results correspond with data from pre-treatment experiments presented above showing a slight protective effect of GL cell priming ( Supplementary Fig. 1A and B) .",

Moreover, when GL was present throughout the experiment (treatment F), virtually no difference in the viability of uninfected cells was detected. Compared to untreated cells after 40 h, viability of cells of treatments D-F was 4-6-fold higher (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4B) . Again the detected amount of viral RNA in the cell supernatants corresponded well with cell viability. In cell supernatants of treatments D-F, only up to 5% of viral RNA was detected when compared to untreated cells after 24 h (Fig. 4C , p < 0.001). After 40 h, the amount of virus RNA was still reduced by up to 28% when compared to untreated (p < 0.01-0.001). These results are also reflected by HA titers (Table 3 ). In a further experiment, GL was added only 1-5 h after infection. Strikingly, no reduction in the amount of viral RNA at 24 h post-infection was observed in the supernatants of these late treatments compared to protocol D where GL was added right after removal of the virus inoculum (Fig. 4D ). This clearly demonstrates that GL mainly interferes with very early stages in the IAV reproductive cycle, most probably virus uptake via endocytosis or fusion of the virus with the endosomal membrane during uncoating.",

The difference is also reflected in NA-treated cells; whereby the overall signals were somewhat lower compared to NA untreated samples, but the reduction of viral RNA in GL-treated cells was still evident. This clearly demonstrates that the difference is not caused by reduced virus binding after GL treatment but indeed differences in the amount of internalized virus. In order to confirm these findings, we constructed a fluorescence-labelled virus and analyzed the impact of GL on virus uptake using FACS. A549 and MDCK cells were treated or not with 1 and 2.5 mM GL, respectively, and infected with fluorescence-labelled IAV at different MOI's. To analyze possible differences in virus adsorption to GL-treated and untreated cells, FACS analysis was performed immediately after removal of the virus inoculum. To analyze virus uptake, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C to allow virus endocytosis prior to FACS analysis. A reduction of approximately 50% of labelled virus in A594 and up to 94% in MDCK cells was detected in GL-treated cells. Fig. 5B shows FACS data from MDCK cells infected at an MOI of 10 with fluorescence-labelled IAV. Compared to untreated cells, an almost complete inhibition of fluorescence-labelled virus cell entry was observed as demonstrated by a shift of the cell population towards the control cell population. This reduction in virus uptake was independent of the virus load used (Table 4 ). However, no significant difference was detected between GL-treated and untreated cells when analyzed directly after virus adsorption (Table 4) . These results again confirm that any effect of GL-binding solely to virus receptor can be excluded as already shown by the HA assay of GL-treated hRBC and virus (Table 2) .",

Several studies have described the antiviral activity of GL against IAV. The data, however, have remained inconsistent. In early studies from the 1980s, the antiviral activity of GL was investigated in a rather unconventional way; eggs were treated with GL and the virus titer reduction was assessed by hemagglutination (Pompei et al., 1983) .

Strikingly, even at high concentrations of 1 mM, GL does not fully block viral infection of host cells.

            "text": "By using different treatment protocols, we aimed to identify the precise time period during which GL exerts its activity in the viral infection cycle. Our data clearly show that GL pre-treatment slightly improves cell viability and reduces viral RNA in cell lysates and cell culture supernatants (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 1A and B) . Only if GL is present during virus adsorption and thereafter, the antiviral effect is appreciably more pronounced. Diverse treatment protocols clearly reveal that GL does not reduce viral RNA in cell supernatants when applied only 1 h after infection (Fig. 4D) . These results lead to the conclusion that GL interferes with an early step in the viral reproductive cycle such as binding of the virus to its receptor, virus uptake by endocytosis, or uncoating of the virus within the cytoplasm. This hypothesis is supported by data published on Epstein-Barr virus replication, where the author claims, that based on the outcome of different GL treatment protocols, GL affects virus penetration, however, without any effect on virus adsorption or inactivation (Lin, 2003) . Evaluation of different GL treatment protocols of cells infected with coronaviruses as well as results from screening experiments using GL derivatives for anti-coronavirus activity also suggest early steps of the virus reproductive cycle being responsible for the antiviral activity of GL (Cinatl et al., 2003; Hoever et al., 2005) . For IAV, however, Pompei et al. (1983) suggested a late step in the viral replication cycle being affected by GL, whereas others were even unable to detect any antiviral in vitro effect of GL at all (Utsunomiya et al., 1997) . In the latter work, the IAV protective effect observed in a mouse model was solely attributed to GL-induced \u2425-IFN secretion by T-cells. Nevertheless, it has to be pointed out that different virus types were discussed and the antiviral activity of GL obviously strongly depends on the nature of the virus and the experimental setup. For IAV, however, no detailed study involving GL has been performed so far to elucidate its antiviral mechanism of action.",

In this study, an inhibition of viral infection by GL was reported for IAV and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and was shown to be mostly due to suppression of the fluidity of the plasma membrane and viral envelope into which GL was incorporated. Specifically, the author postulated that the antiviral effect was due to an inhibition of the formation of fusion pores; however, the author did not discriminate between the two different modes of uncoating of HIV-1 and IAV. In HIV-1, the viral membrane directly fuses with the plasma membrane and the virus capsid is released into the cytoplasm. On the contrary, IAV is taken up into the cell by endocytosis and the viral membrane eventually fuses with the endosomal membrane. In the present study, we clearly demonstrate that GL impedes IAV uptake and not as suggested by Harada (2005) , uncoating of influenza virus after entry. Nevertheless, both processes, cell entry by endocytosis (IAV) and direct fusion of virus and plasma membrane (HIV-1) depend on membrane fluidity which most likely is altered upon GL treatment. Interestingly, non-enveloped virus types such as poliovirus or adenovirus use endocytosis as main cellular entry pathway. An antiviral activity of GL so far has only been described for enveloped virus types; interestingly, GL was reported being inactive against poliovirus infection (Harada, 2005) . The author used a CCID50 method with 10-fold dilution series to detect virus titer reduction. In our experience with IAV it would be necessary to use a modified CCID50 method with narrower dilution series to definitely exclude any antiviral effect of GL on non-enveloped viruses. Thus, further investigations are needed to definitely exclude any antiviral effect of GL on non-enveloped viruses.",

We have shown that GL inhibits virus uptake most likely by interfering with the cellular membrane eventually leading to a reduction in endocytosis. Hence, GL can be termed a virustatic but not a virucidal agent, and interestingly, despite the high concentrations necessary to exhibit its antiviral activity, GL treatment did not result in any cytotoxicity. How these high concentrations translate into potential in vivo efficacy is beyond the scope of this study; however, in case the inhibitory mechanism of GL described here is also the predominant basis for its potential anti-influenza effect in vivo, preclinical/clinical development will be challenging unless synergistic pharmacological actions are obtained. In our view, the mechanistic data presented in this study may form an interesting basis for a medicinal chemistry program based on the molecular structure of GL with the aim to identify derivatives with increased antiviral activity.",
