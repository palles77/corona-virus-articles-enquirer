            "text": "Bacteria are naturally present in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals; in fact, they are necessary for the proper functioning of the digestive system. The vast majority of these bacteria are harmless. However, when an individual is infected by an enteric bacterial pathogen, these microorganisms grow and reproduce in the gastrointestinal tract, and they are shed in the fecal material. Because the enteric bacteria are well-adapted to the conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract, which include high organic carbon concentrations, low pH, and a relatively high temperature (37 C), they tend to have a relatively difficult time growing in the environment. This is because the conditions in soil, water, etc. are generally very different from those in the gastrointestinal tract: nutrients are generally present in low concentrations and/or in difficult-to-metabolize forms, the temperature is not optimal for growth, the moisture content is lower, etc. As a result, the enteric bacteria typically do not compete well with the indigenous soil or water bacteria for the available nutrients. This adversely affects their ability to reproduce, or even survive without reproducing, in the environment. Thus, their longevity in the external environment is typically limited to a few days to weeks, depending on the environmental conditions. Historically, the bacterial pathogens have been the focus of waterborne disease, mainly because they were among the first microorganisms recognized. Bacteria cause many diseases, such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery that have been responsible for large epidemics (and, in the case of cholera, pandemics) all over the world. In general, many of the bacteria pathogens are relatively easy to remove through wastewater and drinking water treatment processes, and, therefore, are of less concern than the other groups of pathogens in many industrialized countries. However, these pathogens are still of great concern in many of the less-industrialized countries, due to the lack of adequate sanitary treatment processes in those countries. According to the WHO/ UNICEF, in 2015 only 39% of the global population (2.9 billion people) used a safely managed sanitation service; that is, excreta safely disposed of in situ or treated off-site. More than 2 billion people lack basic sanitation, and almost 1 billion people still practice open defecation. Some of the most common bacterial pathogens found in human and animal waste that are transmitted by contaminated water and food are listed in Table 1 .

The enteric parasites that are pathogenic to humans can be classified into two groups: the protozoa (sometimes referred to as the protists) and the helminths, which include the intestinal worms. Protozoa are single-celled microorganisms whose life cycles include at least one vegetative as well as at least one resting stage. The infective stage of the protozoa is different for different parasites. In the case of Cryptosporidium, the resting oocyst form must be ingested to initiate infection; for others, the vegetative form must be ingested for infection to occur. The resting stage of the organism (cyst, ovum) is generally relatively resistant to inactivation from environmental stresses and during conventional drinking and wastewater treatment processes.

On the other hand, pathogenic enteric microorganisms are typically only present when an individual is infected. Therefore, if one wants to assess the safety of water for human consumption, the water would have to be continuously monitored for the presence of pathogens in order to be certain of their presence or absence. Additionally, there are hundreds of different pathogens that may be present in feces, so the water would need to be monitored for all of these microorganisms to assure the safety for consumption. When the infective stage is freely suspended in water treated at conventional doses and contact times and pH between 7 and 8. Low means 99% inactivation at 20 C generally in <1 min, moderate 1-30 min and high >30 min. It should be noted that organisms that survive and grow in biofilms, such as Legionella and mycobacteria, will be protected from chlorination. However, it is not technically or economically feasible to test wastewater for the presence of all different types of pathogens, nor is it feasible to continuously monitor water for pathogenic microorganisms. As a consequence, the microbiological quality of water historically has been assessed by monitoring for the presence of alternative organisms-those enteric organisms that are always present in fecal material-the so-called indicator microorganisms. The rationale for using fecal indicator microorganisms is that, if they are found in water, the water contains fecal material, and therefore may also contain pathogenic microorganisms. In contrast, if fecal indicators are absent, the water is considered not to be contaminated by fecal material, and therefore, no fecal pathogens are present. Common indicators or groups of indicator organisms used are the total coliform bacteria, the thermotolerant coliform bacteria (also called fecal coliform bacteria), the enterococci (also called fecal streptococci); examples include Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Bifidobacterium.",

This characteristic can be shown directly through conducting epidemiological studies in which the association between the indicators and health outcomes are assessed. A different, more common, and generally less expensive way to demonstrate the correlation between indicators and health risk is to monitor water for the presence and/or concentration of pathogen and compare those data to data on potential indicator microorganisms. While the latter approach might be simpler and less expensive, it may be more problematic. This is because most pathogen detection methods detect a single pathogen or closely related group of pathogens, and a correlation (or lack thereof ) between an indicator and a single pathogen or pathogen group does not infer that a correlation exists (or does not exist) with other waterborne pathogens.

More recently, other coliform bacteria, including the thermotolerant coliforms (previously termed fecal coliforms and a subgroup of the total coliforms), and E. coli, a specific thermotolerant coliform bacterium, considered specifically of fecal origin, have been added to the commonly used indicator organisms. The US Environmental Protection Agency requires the monitoring of all public sources of drinking water for total coliform bacteria. The use of the total coliform standard to assess the microbiological safety of water has had a dramatic effect on reducing waterborne disease outbreaks in countries that have implemented one.",

Although there is no perfect indicator organism, research is ongoing to find a rapid, relatively inexpensive, and accurate way to assess the microbiological quality of water.",

Use of this group of organisms has some advantages over the coliform group for assessing the microbiological safety of water. These include the fact that they rarely multiply in environmental waters, they are more resistant to treatment processes and environmental stresses, and they generally persist for longer in the environment than do the coliform bacteria. The most common use for these organisms is to indicate the microbiological quality of recreational bathing waters. In addition, enterococci are recommended as one of the groups of fecal indicator organisms that can be used to assess the microbiological quality of groundwater by the US Environmental Protection Agency.",

Therefore, the use of bacterial indicator organisms may not provide accurate information regarding the presence of pathogenic parasites in water. The search for a surrogate organism for parasite removal during treatment processes has led to investigations into the potential use of Clostridium perfringens spores. These bacterial spores are present, typically in very low numbers, in human and animal feces. However, like the protozoans, they are relatively resistant to many forms of drinking water and wastewater treatment processes, so may be useful indicators for parasite and virus removal by treatment. Clostridium spores are used in conjunction with enterococci as secondary indicators of water quality in Hawai'i, due to problems with coliform regrowth in the warm temperatures of the tropical environment.",
