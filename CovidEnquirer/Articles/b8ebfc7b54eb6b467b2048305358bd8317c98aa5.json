            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It has established endemicity in the Arabian Peninsula and has been imported into other countries, including large hospital-related outbreaks in South Korea, demonstrating limited human-to-human transmission. There is no specific treatment or vaccine, and it carries an overall mortality of 30e40%. 1, 2 Current Public Health England (PHE) guidelines recommend that MERS-CoV infection should be considered in any symptomatic patient returning from an endemic area (or who has had contact with a confirmed case) within 14 days, with no alternative explanation. 3 Case definition criteria include cough, fever !38 C, with clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress. However, MERS-CoV may present with a wide spectrum of clinical disease, indistinguishable from other respiratory virus infections. 4 Note that a history of camel contact is not included in these case definition criteria. The potential for aerosol as well as large droplet transmission make the additional healthcare resources required for managing patients with suspected MERS-CoV considerable, particularly the use of negative pressure isolation, enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) and safe laboratory testing. 5, 6 Although there are few actual cases of MERS-CoV in returning pilgrims, the potential for transmission during large religious pilgrimages, especially Hajj, have raised concerns. 7, 8 Given an incubation period of up to two weeks, asymptomatic patients may return unaware that they have contracted the disease.",

An alternative respiratory virus infection was diagnosed in half (50.3%) of the cases, including rhinoviruses, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), and influenza B, which were the most frequently detected. They found that peak testing occurred following the annual Hajj season and during other periods of increased national awareness. 13 The absence of any confirmed MERS-CoV-positive cases highlights the relevance and utility of the current study, but also highlights the need to encourage such pilgrims to increase their uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine, as advised by one of their dedicated travel advice websites. 14 However, with the increasing recognition that MERS-CoV causes a broader range of clinical illness, together with the potential for co-infection with other respiratory viruses leading to a delayed diagnosis of MERS-CoV, we felt that these patients justified the use of appropriate infection prevention measures until MERS-CoV infection had been excluded, as per published guidance. 4, 5, 8, 14 Yet, the management of these patients using single, negative-pressure, isolation rooms, the limiting of staff interactions to essential duties with the use of enhanced PPE, and the secure transportation of laboratory specimens to an outside reference laboratory, posed significant resource and practical challenges in a busy hospital, particularly for patients (including one of ours) requiring intensive care.",

However, this is dependent on the local laboratory results being as reliable. Outside of the Hajj season our hospital sees patients returning from MERS-CoV endemic areas far less frequently. Ensuring that local results are valid would therefore require the local laboratory to regularly undergo quality assurance processes, which would slightly negate the cost-benefits of earlier MERS-CoV exclusion. In addition, the shelf-life of any commercial kit will also impact on the final overall costs of running this MERS-CoV testing service in-house. Unused, outdated test kits would need to be discarded and replaced to cope with any traveller returning sporadically throughout the years from a MERS-CoV-endemic area, with a clinical presentation that would make them eligible for MERS-CoV testing.",
