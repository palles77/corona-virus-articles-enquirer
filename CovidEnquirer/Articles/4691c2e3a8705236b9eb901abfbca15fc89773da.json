            "text": "This novel influenza variant is believed to be the result of a recent reassortment event among three distinct swine influenza virus lineages, resulting in a novel hybrid H1N1 virus including North American swine hemagglutinin (H1), Eurasian neuraminidase (N1) and matrix proteins, and contribution of remaining segments from the classic triple reassortant swine virus. 3 The human index case of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 appears to have occurred in the town of La Gloria in the state of Veracruz, a region containing large-scale industrial pig farms. Spread to Mexico City occurred by 15 March 2009. 4 Between 15 March and 19 April, sporadic cases in Mexico City increased erratically, with person-to-person transmission becoming sustained and amplified after mass population return to the city following the Holy Week holiday (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . A public health emergency was decreed in Mexico on 23 April. After laboratory confirmation of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection on 23 April, Direccion General de Epidemiologia, Secretaria de Salud, Mexico (DGE) developed case definitions. A suspected case was defined as severe respiratory illness with fever, cough and difficulty breathing. A probable case was defined as a suspected case in a patient from whom a specimen had been collected and tested positive for influenza A. A confirmed case was defined as a probable case that tested positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Health-care officials were contacted and asked to provide retrospective and ongoing data for persons having illness consistent with these case definitions and seeking care on or after 1 March. As of 15 June, 6241 cases including 108 deaths have been reported as laboratory-confirmed because of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Mexico. Returning travelers have also seeded cases in 74 other countries, including 35 928 confirmed cases globally as of 15 June with 55 deaths reported outside of Mexico to date. 5 On 11 June, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be the first global influenza pandemic in 41 years. 6 The initial community outbreak in Mexico City, a metropolitan urban area with about 20 million inhabitants, provides a critical glimpse into the further epidemic potential of this virus. Early transmission in Mexico City was punctuated by two pivotal sociological events. First, from 5 to 19 April, schools were closed and approximately 10% of the population left the city for the Holy Week holiday. 7 This may have temporarily reduced transmission within the city while increasing the risk of spread to other communities. Second, on 23 April, the government of Mexico City declared a public health emergency that may have increased hospital visits for milder illness that might otherwise have gone unreported. Mexico as a whole experienced a mild and delayed 2008-2009 influenza season, with other human subtypes of influenza viruses; the extent to which human influenza and other respiratory viruses contributed to illness reports during that period is unknown.",

The estimate is refined with every additional day of time series data. For typical unmitigated influenza epidemics, values from this method typically converge to the best estimate of R within a few days, before the acceleration of the outbreak, and remain stable throughout the epidemic period.

At the time of this study, little was known about these parameters for the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak in Mexico City. Empirical data from contact investigations of confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the Canadian province of Ontario suggest that the median interval between contact with a confirmed symptomatic case and development of symptoms is 6 days (95% CI 5-7 days). As such, we used a 5-day latent period and 2-day asymptomatic infectious period as a plausible upper bound for time from infection until development of symptomatic disease. Thus, we considered a wide range of possible values estimated for other strains of influenza and large urban centers, respectively ( Table 1 ). The infectious period of a case may be curtailed by hospitalization or selfisolation prior to recovery or death. We therefore directly estimated the distribution of removal rates via either natural causes or intervention by calculating the numbers of days between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization (type II and III triage protocol) or self-isolation (type I triage protocol) for all reported cases. We assumed that unreported asymptomatic or mild cases 12 remained infectious until recovery.",

The large pulse, from 78 to 407 cases occurred from 19 April -the last day of the Holy Week period -to 26 April, shortly after initial pronouncements by Mexico's Public Health Secretary. The number of laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (epidemic curve C) was significantly lower than the initial curve of suspected patients (S). Many of the original suspect cases were not infected with influenza A at all (N), and a number were infected by influenza A strains other than pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (A). Based on suspect cases prior to 20 April, we estimate a reproduction number of 1AE51 (95% CI 1AE32-1AE71); for confirmed cases, it is 1AE43 (95% CI 1AE29-1AE57). (Table 2 ) To assess the reliability of estimates made from early epidemic data, we estimated the reproduction number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 using both early data (Figure 1 , curve A) and later data (Figure 1, other curves) , and compared the results of these two analyses. For each day, we estimate R using the full time series preceding and including that day. The estimates stabilize approximately one week before the end of Holy Week.

The surprisingly synchronous changes in non-influenza A cases (curve N) suggests that some of the fluctuations may be caused by extrinsic factors rather than underlying transmission dynamics. Assuming that there were no other respiratory epidemics in the same period, it is plausible that the marked increase in reported cases after 19 April is attributable to a surge in notification spurred by the end of Holy Week and the public health decrees.",

This adjusted time series should represent the number of cases identified if the public health measures described had not been implemented. Of note, the peak of the adjusted epidemic curve shifts from 27 April to 23 April, the date the public alert took place and when the social distancing interventions were implemented. This suggests that the public health interventions may have significantly mitigated the epidemic. Adjustment using both the patients without influenza (curve N) and those with non-pandemic influenza A (curve A) has similar impacts ( Figure 2 ). Looking at the time period immediately before 23 April, one may also use either curve A or N to 'inflate' the number of confirmed cases to reflect the hypothetical scenario of early heightened surveillance and public awareness (from the start of the epidemic) ( Figure 3A ,B). This approach increases confirmed cases closer to the 'true' prevalence. Estimates of R based on the four adjusted curves are also given in Table 2 . Unlike the estimates based on the raw data, these estimates remain relatively stable throughout the period of heightened awareness and surveillance.",

            "text": "Although most discussions of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 will likely focus on how it compares with the three 20th century influenza pandemics, we believe that comparison with SARS-CoV will also yield critical policy implications for public health intervention. The SARS-CoV had a relatively long 4-to 6-day incubation period and a peak infectious period that was delayed until the tenth day of severe illness. 16 SARS was transmitted predominantly in the healthcare settings, with a case fatality rate exceeding 10%. These features made SARS relatively easy to detect and readily amenable to individual-based control measures such as case isolation and contact tracing before substan-tial spread could occur beyond initial seeding and local hospital-based outbreaks. Influenza viruses, in contrast, are characterized by shorter incubation (typically 1-4 days), pre-clinical virus shedding and peak infectiousness shortly after illness onset. 17, 18 Influenza illness comprises a spectrum including mild or asymptomatic infection with overall case fatality below 2% even during the worst pandemic on record (1918) and 10-fold lower still during subsequent pandemics. 19 In keeping with this classic influenza profile, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 shows a larger proportion of mild infections, community-based propagation and a lower case fatality than SARS. 20 Thus, while the reproduction numbers of the two infections are not dramatically different, they likely will require a different set of population-based social distancing and mitigation measures. General reinforcement of voluntary self-isolation, cough etiquette, handwashing and self-monitoring by contacts combined with social strategies to disrupt complex contact networks and lessen virus amplification and adaptation at the community level are needed. National health authorities in North America and Europe have implemented varying school closure policies (e.g. broadly in Mexico, targeted in the UK and minimal in the US) in an attempt to contain viral transmission; as of this writing, these measures are being scaled back, but further interventions to change social contact patterns may be important as the outbreak progresses. 21 Pandemics are classically defined as the emergence of novel influenza A subtypes that have not previously been experienced by human populations, or at least not for a 2009 remains a worthwhile goal until a safe and effective vaccine can be developed and administered. Furthermore, global inequalities in social and economic conditions amplify the impacts of infectious diseases, including influenza. 22 As our estimates account for important sociological anomalies and are based on multiple data sources from communities rather than closed settings, they are likely to be broadly applicable. However, our optimistic prognosis relies on several critical assumptions about disease progression, virulence, and reporting rates, and it is clear that worse scenarios could evolve. Vigilant surveillance, self-isolation, adherence to social distancing and hygiene measures, strategic school closures, and other community measures to mitigate spread, as directed by national policy, may be paramount in the months to come.
