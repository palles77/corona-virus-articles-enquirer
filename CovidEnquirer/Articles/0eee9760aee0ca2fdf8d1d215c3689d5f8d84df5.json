For the remaining cases with negative viral detection, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was excluded based on inconsistent epidemiological, clinical or radiological data. Among these, 22 were excluded from the analysis because of lack of CT scan or no signs of pneumonia on CT scan, and finally 67 patients with pneumonia of other etiologies were included for analysis as the non-COVID-19 group (see patient selection flowchart in Figure 1 ).",

Increased total WBC and neutrophil counts were more common in patients with other causes of pneumonia. In contrast, although decrease of lymphocytes was also common in our study, the difference between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases was not significant, probably due to the fact that pneumonias enrolled for this analysis were mostly viral(for example, influenza) or atypical, as classical bacterial pneumonia had been excluded by first screening/triage. Additionally, the percentage of our patients with decreased lymphocytes was not as high as that reported in some previous studies 2, 15 , perhaps due to differences in disease severity. Blood lymphopenia was observed in up to 85% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 16 . Compared with mild and moderate cases, severe cases were more likely to have lymphopenia 2,16,17 . A recent paper by Xu and colleagues showed a lymphocyte decrease in 38% of the cases within symptom onset \u2264 10 days 18 , which was consistent with our data. Therefore, we speculate that persisting decrease of lymphocytes may be an indicator of severe disease, rather than a criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

The other patient and his father had fever and cough almost at the same time. Both of them had typical findings of viral pneumonia on CT scans, and 2019-nCoV was detected in the throat swab from his father subsequently.
