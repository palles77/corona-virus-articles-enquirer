What is currently needed is attention to the possibly social, built, and natural trends that may function as the enablers of these epidemicsas distinct from the virus itself, which in the case of HPAI easily moves between wild and domestic bird populations (Wilcox & Colwell, 2005) . Such an approach emphasizing the landscapes of outbreak origin will suggest preventative tools in addition to the reactive policy tools currently available, such as quarantine, vaccination, and eradication, as called for in Kapan et al.

While this focus on the relationship between infectious diseases and urban planning is a welcome development, their planning recommendations generally focus on responses to disease outbreaks instead of prevention. Using the case of avian influenza and urban planning, this study examines some of the planning issues that may be related to preventing the occurrence of EID's (Wilcox & Colwell, 2005 ).

An environmental Kuznets curve suggests that in a developing economy, little weight is given to environmental concerns such as deforestation or pollution. After attaining a certain standard of living, however, a nation-state's focus changes from self-interest, to social interest, and as a result forests are replanted or protected and pollution is controlled. Even though some scholars have shown that Kuznets curves are not applicable universally (see Park, Russell, & Lee, 2007) , the debate has illustrated a simple and powerful method for empirically testing hypotheses about nonlinear trajectories of development.",

In addition to these basic principles, others have focused on the growth of illegal settlements (Tang & Chung, 2002) , the role of international trade (Pannell & Ma, 1997) , as well as the political shifts that occur with such urbanization (Steck, 2006) .

These scholars' central premise is that human EID risks have arisen due to an inattention to the physical and social changes associated with urban and agrarian transitions that result in increased prevalence of disease among domesticated animals, which in turn is more easily transmitted to humans. Very few (e.g. Ferguson et al., 2005; Longini et al., 2005; Spencer, 2013) , however, have empirically modeled the relationship between these combined forces and either human or animal EIDs.",

Longini et al. (2005) and Ferguson et al. (2005) separately modeled possible H5N1 (the scientific terminology for virus type in Vietnam) outbreaks among human populations, attempting to predict how a human HPAI pandemic might evolve in Thailand. As a starting point, their analysis used spatial units to predict how quickly and in which geographic directions an H5N1 pandemic would move. While their findings could not conclusively point to future outbreaks, the studies show promise for developing new spatial tools for understanding when a possible epidemic might become a pandemic beyond effective intervention, and thereby have targeted geographic implications for possible responses to a human avian influenza pandemic. Because of their focus on HPAI in humans, neither of these studies contribute significantly to an improved understanding of how and why H5N1 among poultry has evolved in the places it has. Spencer (2013) analysis of district level spatial units in Vietnam seeks to understand the origins of HPAI in poultry by creating \"coherence\" indices of micro-spaces in order to determine the association between HPAI poultry outbreaks and the urban transition. These measures also provide a methodological platform for estimating many different acute impacts of the urban transition.",

This method mathematically defines a set of indices of \"settlement coherence\" based on household-level infrastructure and amenities. In particular, the measure examined household-level building material, water supply, and sanitation systems to estimate the extent to which periurban neighborhoods displayed traditional, transitional, or modern characteristics. Detailed discussion of these coherence indices can be found in Spencer (2013), but, in sum, Spencer, et al. Landscape and Urban Planning 193 (2020) 103681 the original scale from \u22121 to +1 measures the relative mix of four types of household features that are generally considered to be measures of increasing modernization. So, for example, the sanitation coherence measure equals \u22121 where all households in a given commune or district have no toilet (least modern), and a +1 where they all have a flush toilet (most modern). The sanitation coherence measure equals 0, for example, where each of the four household technologies -no toilet, a pit latrine, a composting toilet, or a flush toilet -are 25% of the total. For our purposes here, where we use the variable in a regression model instead of displaying visual patterns, we take the absolute value of the coherence indices. Thus, the lowest-risk areas (both perfectly urban and perfectly rural) at both ends of this metric variable distribution are valued at 1, and highest risk ones at 0. The original use of this method in Spencer (2013) was for commune-and district-level data from the 1999 Vietnam Census of Population and Housing. In this study, we update the methodology with the same coherence index variables, but taken from the 2006 Agricultural Census. To illustrate the geography of these household infrastructures, Figs. 2, 3, and 4 show the raw values (i.e. not the absolute values) of district level measures of urban transition.",

These factors of disease risk are most consistent with the hypothesis that \"wet markets\" in Asia are one of the primary sources of HPAI outbreaks (Fourni\u00e9 et al., 2012) . Thus, including the percent of the adult population with a secondary school education, as well as the percent of the population that has completed college should provide a good measure of background awareness of human sanitary issues regarding HPAI. Of course, our interest here is in poultry behavior that minimizes exposure to risk; however, in the absence of good poultry behavior variables, we hypothesize that a more educated community will show differences regarding their overall common-sense practices in keeping livestock and wild populations separated on the farm, and in wet markets. 6.3.5. Percent collective sector employment Talhelm et al. (2014) have demonstrated that the practice of rice agriculture and the use of work collectives have long-term results on how collective goods are locally achieved; that this form of work organization will result in positive collective action on subsequent community-level issues. Similarly, Carnap (2017) has outlined the debate using the language of \"social capital,\" but finds that such cooperative work structures do not cross over to achieve results outside of agriculture. Whatever the case, though, historic forms of agricultural work organization may affect a community's capacity to act collectively in general.

This is especially relevant with regard to land use management. Thus, governance at the local level should be accounted for in our model. Given its Socialist history, Vietnam has a robust system of collectives that match the capacities of local government to implement policy among its population, although it varies significantly by region.

These coefficients approximately doubled for the commune analysis, other than for sanitation. We believe that this is likely the result of districts showing greater variation in sanitation coherence due to the universal presence of larger towns at this geographic scale. Thus, one of our most important findings is that, taken together, results suggest that because sanitation is the last of the three infrastructures that is implemented consistently in rural areas, that it may in fact be the best predictor of future poultry HPAI outbreaksand perhaps the most protective of the three coherence measures tested.",

As a strict measure of household wealth increase, this measure is consistent with the idea that household scale modernization reflects a growing economy likely associated with intensified livestock production, as has been the case in China (e.g. Bai et al., 2018) , that overall elevates risk. We interpret this phenomenon as likely paired with similar results of the secondary education coefficients. While our original hypothesis was that secondary education would be associated with hand-washing and protection from HPAI, the results do imply that this measure may be dominated by its role in approximating rapidand largely unmitigated -economic growth. In other words, without an explicit measure of increasingly modern economic opportunities, both household modernization and secondary education serve as proxies for the household wealth accumulation and individual human capital growth, respectively, both of which are linear, and measures of rapid economic development even though they may have some negative externalities. This explanation is much more consistent with our other findings than the explanation that these variables are directly related to HPAI risk. This is not to say that hand-washing is unimportant regarding HPAI risk, but that the positive effects are drowned out by education's function as a proxy for economic development. Importantly, these findings suggest that HPAI risk in Vietnam is a part of the rapid development process, not necessarily something that is unexpected.",

This finding echoes some of the critiques of social capital that such networks can be systematically dysfunctional under certain circumstancesa kind of \"negative\" social capital associated with work collectives and historical local administrative practices (Portes, 2014) . Our results do clearly show a negative impact of the variable, and is best interpreted as suggesting that work collectives and the local administrative capacities that they represent may embody historical practices and habits that elevate risk of HPAI outbreak. Further investigation of this result is warranted, but some initial illustrations of relevant hypotheses might include that collectives are less willing to self-regulate, or that they embody institutional and habitual resistance to changes in livestock, agricultural, and other practices.",

These very high figures are in striking opposition to other regions of the country, with much lower odds ratios, all of which are less than 1. On the other hand, Table 6 shows the odds ratio for the Red River Delta regarding sanitation coherence is less than 5% likelihood of a sanitation-coherent district having an outbreak compared to a fully incoherent one. The South Southeast remains at elevated HPAI likelihood with greater coherence. There is a similar outlier region for the water supply coherence measure, the South Central Coast, when compared to the other regions in the country which generally have very low outbreak likelihoods for water supply-coherent districts compared to others. Here, results show a vastly increased likelihood of outbreak with coherent water supplies (23,386), even as the control variables show no particular divergence from the values of the other regions.

Thus, when taken at the district level, it appears that household infrastructure coherence is not a good predictor of HPAI outbreaks where there is the highest level of urbanization and managed development. This hypothesis explaining these outliers is consistent with Spencer (2013) results, which found that coherence indices correlated with the middle values of coherence, and therefore the cases of completely agrarian and completely urban development. What remains unclear from these regional findings, however, is whether the cause of this lack of fit in the developed urban areas is the result of the levels of economic activities related to poultry consumption, trans-shipment, and other secular trends, or whether the result of large, unified planning districts under control of a single water supply authority, sewer system, or master plan. One way to think about this question is whether the lack of fit results from greater poultry-related activity that elevates risk, or lesser capacities of the risk-reduction infrastructures. An examination of the findings at the commune level may shed some light on this question.",

Thus, if the risk-reduction capacities were the reason why the coherence indices fit less well in these cities, then one would expect to find similar results when examined at the commune level; if the commune results differ significantly in magnitude and/or direction, it is more likely that the poultry-related activities is the reason why the model does not fit well in these areas. When the regional analysis is conducted at the commune spatial level, there are few of these vast variations in odds ratio across socioecologic areas. As with the district analysis, Table 8 shows elevated risk for coherence communes in the Red River Delta and the South Southeast regions (3.939 and 1.173 respectively), but Table 10 shows the South Central region with an odds ratio below 1 (0.715), which differs not only in magnitude, but direction as well, from the positive outlier seen in Table 7 .

Because of this, the district level in a megacity region is likely to represent a very different set of daily relationships among households than it is in a more remote area where agricultural practices are major aspects of daily life. Consistent with this interpretation, the odds ratios for the Red River Delta and the South Southeast at the commune level are much more in line with the other regions' results. One simple way to think about these outliers is that a district in the mega-region of Ho Chi Minh City is more like a city than it is like a district. On the other hand, any given commune in the Ho Chi Minh City region is probably more like a commune in one of the smaller and more remote regions. Overall, this interpretation suggests that further research must be done if the coherence index approach may is to be appropriate for fully urbanized areas.",

Using a previously-tested measure of \"coherence,\" this study examines the independent association between the outbreaks of HPAI in Vietnam and a set of coherence indices that measure nonlinear urban transitional dynamics.",

First, theoretically defining and estimating a Kuznets curve for urbanization and human settlement is a key step towards developing a valid theoretical and multivariate -as distinguished from Spencer (2013)model for understanding the household infrastructure landscape transition contributors to the emergence of new infectious diseases. More precisely, it seeks to understand the rapid emergence of formerly rare diseases among animals, which in turn presents dire risks for human populations. While our case examines HPAI in the context of Vietnam, the concept and methodology is easily adapted to other concerns ranging from Ebola to the re-emergence of dengue fever. Given the global importance of our rapidly expanding urban landscapes and ecologies, this approach towards the study of urbanizationand its importance for understanding new health riskshas broad applicability. Moreover, since urban expansion is largely the result of complex individual and societal decisions, planning and policy has a central role to play. In fact, the types and gaps in urban and regional planning may not just be the solutions to a growing problem of EID's, but in fact they may be their cause as well. Before such questions can be answered using the coherence indices defined in this paper, however, a better understanding of how the model must be adapted to highly urbanized areas must be developed through future studies.",

            "text": "Second, our empirical investigation provides quantified evidence on built environment household characteristics as correlates of HPAI outbreaks in Vietnam. In doing so, it stands to provide planners and policy makers with a set of heretofore unavailable spatial identification tools. One approach following from the analysis would be increased surveillance for HPAI in communities of high \"incoherence\" as measured by the most robust variables. For this policy implication, our finding that HPAI risk is most elastic and protective with respect to unit changes in sanitation coherence is important. Our research suggests, for example, that targeting those districts with the greatest disparities regarding the mix of sanitation typesi.e. where sanitation coherence measures are at, or close to zero -would yield the greatest payoffs, even though focusing on water supply characteristics and construction materials would also be helpful. Thus, for example, proactively monitoring poultry flocks in these areas of great diversity in sanitation infrastructure would mean placing monitors there so as to make epidemic and pandemic outbreaks much more quickly identified than is currently possible. Such a directed planning intervention, as opposed to one that spread efforts out across the country with less intensive observation, would lead to improved surveillance results.",
