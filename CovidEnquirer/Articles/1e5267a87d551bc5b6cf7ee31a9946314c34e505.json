The GIT is one of the largest and heaviest organ systems of the animal.

In healthy cattle, the forestomachs occupy more than half the abdominal cavity. The rumen ( Fig. 1) alone has a capacity range of 102 to 148 L (which approximates to a similar weight in kilograms), whereas the abomasal volume ranges from 10 to 20 L. 1 The intestines occupy a much smaller space in the peritoneal cavity but have a length that is considerable, ranging from 33 to 63 m. 1 Thus, a thorough examination is physically demanding because of its size and requires a significant proportion of time to adequately examine its entirety.",

If that is the only means of assessment, then ensure that other segments with similar gross lesions are sampled for histopathology. Small amounts of water under low pressure or small amounts poured over the mucosa more gently clear the contents from the surface and allow more detailed examination. If a pathogen is suspected, representative sections of bowel should be collected for microbiologic testing before opening or flushing the segments. Ensure that segments of intestine collected for microbial testing are kept closed, using string to seal the ends of the segments.

The soft palate is continuous with the hard palate and tends to have a smooth surface. The cheek mucosa has long, broad, aborally directed papillae that are sharply pointed in health (Fig. 4) . Tongues are their principle organ of prehension in cattle. Overlying the dorsal surface of the tongue are small, fine, sharp papillae, many of which play a sensory role. Approximately three-fifths caudal to the rostral tip is the lingual fossa demarcating the rostral edge of a large dorsal prominence called the torus linguae. 2 Brown to blackened teeth with hypoplastic enamel is likely caused by chronic fluorosis (Fig. 5) .

Oropharyngeal mucous membranes can become pale because of anemia or severe blood loss. Alternatively, they can become cyanotic because of cardiovascular compromise and collapse.

In North America, these most often are categorized as foreign animal diseases or transboundary animal diseases. Commonly, intact vesicles or erosions, the result of ruptured vesicles, are the first sign of concern, initially observed on the muzzle and in the oral cavity. Ruptured vesicles and erosions when secondarily infected, can become deep, inflamed, painful, mucosal ulcers. Possible causes include foot-and-mouth disease, vesicular stomatitis, chronic BVD, BTV, and MCF ( Fig. 10) . 3 Other causes that tend to lead to severe erosion or ulceration include blister beetle (cantharidin) toxicosis; traumatic injury secondary to coarse feeds or caustic chemicals; and uremia. In extreme cases, plant awns or hair may embed themselves in the ulcerated lingual mucosa, especially in the lingual fossa, giving the appearance of lingual \"hair\" (Fig. 11 ). Two of the more commonly referred to ailments of the oropharynx that lead to swelling and variation in size are \"lumpy jaw\" and \"wooden tongue.\" The former is also referred to as \"actinomycosis,\" denoting a severe osteomyelitis that results from Actinomyces bovis penetration through the oropharyngeal mucosa with subsequent penetration of the periosteum of the mandible and eventual mandibular osteomyelitis. 4 This results in a severely disfiguring disease (Fig. 12) . Wooden tongue, also called \"actinobacillosis,\" is a lingual infection by Actinobacillus lignieresii. The tongue becomes markedly enlarged and painful and may develop ulceration because of its obstructive size and susceptibility to trauma (Fig. 13) . 5 Animals repeatedly exposed to bracken fern forage run the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the upper GIT (Fig. 14) . 6 Rarely, other neoplasms may affect the oropharynx leading to cachexia either through obstruction or because of impaired ability to masticate food.",

Transmission probably occurs through direct contact and stress or immunosuppression may precipitate disease. 10 These lesions are variable in size, typically very round to oval, and can be subtle raised foci or very prominent papules with raised rims and eroded centers and have adherent fibrin and feed material (Fig. 17) . Erosions can affect the esophagus with causes similar to those described for the oropharynx (BVD, MCF, BTV) (Fig. 18) . Deeper ulcerated lesions may be the result of secondarily infected BVD erosions, mucosal disease, MCF, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, ruptured vesicles, or mucosal trauma (Fig. 19 ). 3 Mucosal injury to the esophagus tends to heal by fibrosis and scarring resulting in luminal narrowing and stricture formation near the site of injury (Fig. 20) . Injury may be caused by luminal foreign bodies that become lodged or any of the other infectious causes. Proximal to the stricture, the esophagus may become dilated because of slowed or impaired passage of ingesta into the forestomachs. Periesophageal fasciitis that can result from \"balling gun\" injuries can cause esophageal luminal narrowing (Fig. 21) . Traumatic injury from boluses forcibly ejected into the surrounding periesophageal tissue results in localized tissue damage, edema, and inflammation. In addition, pharyngeal trauma associated with this type of injury can result in acquired megaesophagus presumably caused by vagal nerve injury. 11 Rarely, intraluminal, mural, or periesophageal neoplasia can result in obstruction, luminal narrowing or dilation, dependent on either direct or indirect effects on esophageal function (Fig. 22) .",

This staining tends to be relatively uniform throughout these compartments with the exception of the broad rumen pillars, which often are pale, lack papillae, and tend to have a thickened squamous mucosa. When the stained superficial layers of stratified squamous epithelium become blotchy, it is often an indication of disease processes that cause superficial erosions, such as BVD, MCF, or chemical rumenitis (Fig. 26) . Similar blotchiness of the omasal mucosa is also typically seen. Any type of hemorrhagic diathesis can result in mural hemorrhages to any tissue or organ system. One cause to keep in mind is the acute hemorrhagic and thrombocytopenic form of acute BVD (Fig. 27) . 13 Ulceration and mural necrosis can be seen in cases of necrobacillosis and mycotic infections. Both conditions are typically secondary invasion of the forestomach mucosa by Fusobacterium necrophurm or fungal organisms after primary traumatic or chemically (acidosis) induced mucosal injury (Fig. 28) . Necrobacillosis invades through the mucosa into the wall but rarely penetrates to the serosal surfaces (Fig. 29) . However, mycotic infections can either be superficial mucosal proliferation caused by infections with Candida albicans (Fig. 30) or deep and transmural involving the ruminal serosa because of the propensity of many fungi (ie, Aspergillus spp, Mucor spp, Absidia spp, Rhizoporus spp) to not only proliferate in squamous epithelium but also in the walls of blood vessels causing deep inflammation and infarction (Fig. 31) . 11 Ruminal mucosa varies from lacking papilla along the pillars to being densely covered by rumen papilla that range in length and size depending on the predominant feed-associated volatile fatty acids produced in the rumen fluid. Physiologic thickening and lengthening of the ruminal villi tends to occur with feeds that result in higher levels of propionate and butyrate. Conversely, as the percent of dietary roughage increases, production of propionic and butyric acid decreases while ruminal acetic acid levels tend to increase, and ruminal mucosal papillar hypertrophy and hyperplasia does not occur. 11 During necropsy examination of a normal adult bovid, the oral and esophageal mucosa remain firmly and tenaciously attached to the underlying submucosa, whereas the forestomach mucosa tends to normally lift off and away from the underlying, typically reddened submucosa within a few hours of death (Fig. 32) . 3 Conversely, easily sloughed oral and esophageal mucosa and firmly adherent forestomach mucosa are indications of disease.",

It is typically slightly more purple than the forestomachs on its serosal surface and typically has a mucosa that is more red to reddish purple. The mucosal surface has much more of a wet, glistening sheen, lining a series of rugal folds. Red, multifocal to confluent areas of hemorrhage in the abomasal mucosa are most often an indication of an ulcerative or infarction process (Fig. 37) . Causes for such changes include various hemorrhagic diatheses including toxins (arsenic); corticosteroids (exogenous and endogenous); and infectious diseases (acute, thrombocytopenic, hemorrhagic BVD) (see Fig. 27 ). Perforating abomasal ulcers tend to affect young cattle. Less commonly, older animals may develop ulcerative lesions that eventually perforate and cause severe peritonitis (Fig. 38) . Abomasal displacement and volvulus is a common condition affecting dairy cattle usually around the time of parturition. With the highest incidence in intensively managed herds, the abomasum typically displaces ventrally and to the left of the rumen. Less commonly, the abomasum displaces to the right increasing the chance for abomasal volvulus. The omasum is often involved in abomasal torsions. When severe, blood vessels in the neck of the omasum become obstructed resulting in not only organ distention but also severe congestion and hemorrhage (Fig. 39) . 15 Focal to diffuse mucosal thickening of abomasal rugal folds is characteristic of parasitism (Fig. 40) . The lesion is a combination of mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia with associated chronic inflammation. The causes for this lesion include either Ostertagia spp or Trichostrongylus axei. 11 The most common neoplasm that affects cattle is lymphoma. The abomasal wall is a predilection site (Fig. 41) . Infiltration may be diffuse imparting a pale tan tincture to the entire affected area or multifocal, nodular infiltration of neoplastic lymphocytes. Other common sites for infiltration by neoplastic lymphocytes include forestomachs, heart, lymphoid organs, liver, reproductive tract, and spinal canal. 16 ",

Large numbers of macrophages are attracted to the lamina propria and submucosa of the affected intestine resulting in distinctive corrugation of the mucosa (Fig. 48) with a subsequent reduction in luminal diameter and functional absorptive surface area. In addition, a distinctive serosal and mesenteric response to this organism is granulomatous lymphangitis (see Fig. 48B ). Jejunal hemorrhagic syndrome (or hemorrhagic bowel syndrome) is a relatively poorly understood entity of cattle resulting from chronic and ongoing intraluminal small intestinal hemorrhage without any evidence of concurrent enteritis (Fig. 49) . Typically, affected animals present with signs of obstruction or possibly sudden death. The lesion can be segmental with variably sized collections of clotted blood that tend to minimally distend affected loops and yet have an underlying mucosa that is typically grossly normal. Isolation of Clostridium perfringens type A from cattle with this condition has been reported but likely does not represent a definitive cause. 17 Others have reported in dairy cattle that intensive management procedures and minimal exposure to pasture in high producing herds are predisposing factors to the development of this syndrome. 18 Mesenteric and omental fat and other fat stores can become massively necrotic with areas of saponification in cattle (Fig. 50) . Typically, affected animals are overconditioned, 2 years of age or older, and frequently of Channel Island lineage. The areas of necrosis and saponification are palpably hard and potentially obstructive. These lesions can vary from incidental findings to a cause of intestinal obstruction. 11 ",
