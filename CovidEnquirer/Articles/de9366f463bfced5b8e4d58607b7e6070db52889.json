Sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected simultaneously, and causative organisms were identified by conventional bacterial culture together with exhaustive bacterial and viral identification by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The subjects were eight patients diagnosed with mild or moderate pneumonia at Sotobo Children's Clinic Outpatient Department between October 2006 and June 2007. TBPM-PI was administered at the recommended clinical dose of 4 mg/kg b.i.d. to five patients and at a high dose of 6 mg/kg b.i.d. to three patients. Sputum was collected from all patients, and 11 strains were detected from washed sputum culture. Causative organisms were mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (6 strains), and nasopharyngeal swabs showed the same organisms as coughed-up sputum. Real-time PCR for individual viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae identified four cases of only bacterial infection, one case of M. pneumoniae coinfection, two cases of viral coinfection, and one case of both viral and M. pneumoniae coinfection. The clinical results indicated efficacy in all patients, and causative organisms were 100% eliminated. In the four patients with only bacterial infection, the average fever of 38.9\u00b0C at the start of treatment normalized the following day, showing excellent efficacy. No clinically problematic adverse events occurred, and compliance was good. We consider that these cases provide valuable insights into the identity of pathogenic organisms of pneumonia in children and the possible role of TBPM-PI in outpatient treatment.",

TBPM-PI was shown to be effective in such cases for which hospitalization is recommended. In particular, for the four cases that had only bacterial infections, the average fever, which was 38.9\u00b0C at the start of treatment, normalized the following day, showing rapid clinical efficacy. Until now the treatment of such cases of pneumonia was generally considered to depend on hospitalization of the child to administer intravenous antimicrobials. We can treat some patients with pneumonia of moderate degree with oral cephems and high-dose penicillin. The sensitivity of oral cephems to S. pneumoniae decreased recently, and some children have difficulty in taking high-dose oral penicillin. Thus, we have the superiority of TBPM-PI for the treatment of mild to moderate pneumonia in outpatients. We should administer TBPM-PI carefully, with consideration of its cost and the development of resistant bacteria. The treatment with oral cephems or high-dose penicillin is sometimes not efficacious for pneumonia caused by some resistant organisms, such as penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae. We administer TBPM-PI as a second choice of antimicrobial agents for pneumonia in children in cases in which oral cephems or high-dose penicillin is not effective. Appropriate use of carbapenem is important for preventing resistant bacteria.",
