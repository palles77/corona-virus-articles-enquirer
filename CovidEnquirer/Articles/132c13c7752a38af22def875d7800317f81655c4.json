A high level of similarity was detected between the leader protcasc of foot-and-mouth-disease virus and the protease of murine hepatitis coronavirus which cleaves the N-terminal ~28 protein from the polyprotcin. Statistically significant alignment of a portion of the rubella virus polyprotein with cellular papain-like proteascs was obtained, lasding to tentative identification of the papain-like protcase as the enzyme mediating processing of the non-structural proteins of this virus. Specific grouplyg between the sequences of the proteases of cr-viruses, and poty-and bymoviruses was revealed. It was noted that papainlike protcases of positive-str;qded RNA viruws are much more variable both in their sequences and in genomic locations than chymotrypsin-related proteases found in the same vim: class. A novel conarvcd domain of unknown function has also been identified which flanks the papain-like pro.",

When the entire polyproteins of MHV and FMDV (more than 6900 and 2300 amino acids, respectively) were compared by program DotHelix, these segments were found to be the most closely related, with their alignment score being about 8 SD above the random expectation (not shown). These observations allow us to predict the catalytic Cys residue of the L-pro of FMDV. It has been shown that the substitution of Ile for Thr in the vicinity of this residue (Fig. 1) abolished the protease activity, unlike four other mutations in the N-terminal half of L-pro [ 191. Due to the weak sequence conservation around the catalytic His of the identified viral papain-like pro-202 teases, all three histidines, which are conserved in the sequenced FMDV strains, remain, for the meantime, candidates for the role of the catalytic residue.",

The sequence similarity between the rubivirus polyprotein fragment (residues from 1124 to 1320) and 12 eucaryotic proteases could be characterized by scores in the range between 4.5 and 12.2 SD. These values were obtained upon aligning the RuV sequence with the cellular ones with or withorat the omission of inserts present in some of the cellular proteases, respectively (not shown). This identifies the putative rubelIa virus protease and demonstrates the so far most pronounced similarity between cellular and viral papain-like proteases. It was noted, however, that not all of the sequence segments highly conserved in cellular enzymes are retained in the putative protease of RuV. In particular, of the six Cys residues conserved in the cellular proteases, only two (including the catalytic one) are found in the rubella virus protein, suggesting that the two characteristic disulfide bridges of the cellular proteases are not conserved in the viral counterpart, Among the viral proteases, RuV M-pro shares the most convincing similarity with IBV M-pro in the region around the putative catalytic Cys residue (Fig. 1) .",

As a whole, the sequences of these proteases around the proposed catalytic Cys and His residues have relatively little in common, except for the notable CW(Y) dipeptide. The sequences around the catalytic His residues of cellular, and of (putative) viral proteases are even more variable (Fig. 1) . The lengths of the spacers separating the two catalytic residues in the (putative) viral proteases varied from quite long (i.e. comparable to the longest found in cell proteases) in the coronavirus enzymes to exceptionally short in the W, poty-and bymovirus proteases (Fig. 1) .",
