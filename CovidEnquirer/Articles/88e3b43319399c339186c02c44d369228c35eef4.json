Binary systems based on sitespecific recombination are one of the most effective potential approaches for cancer gene therapy. In these systems, a cancer specific promoter expresses a site-specific recombinase/integrase that in turn controls the expression of a toxin gene. In the current study, we have developed a new HK022 bacteriophage Integrase (Int) based binary system activating a Diphtheria toxin (DTA) gene expression specifically in cancer cells. We have demonstrated the efficiency, and the high specificity of the system in vitro in cell cultures and in vivo in a lung cancer mouse model. Strikingly, different apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors demonstrated a remarkable efficacy killing capability of the Int-based binary system compared to the conventional hTERT-DTA mono system in the LLC-Kat lung cancer mice model; we observed that the active hTERT promoter down regulation by the transcription factors Mad-1 is the cornerstone of this phenomenon. The new Int-based binary system offers advantages over already known counterparts and may therefore be developed into a safer and efficient cancer treatment technology.",

Similarly, use of the conventional cancer drugs in chemotherapy also has seriously side effects on the healthy cells, organs and whole organisms (4) . The main reason of these harmful consequences is lack of tumor specificity. Moreover, the primary intrinsic and/or acquired multidrug resistance is one of the main obstacles to successful cancer treatment (5;6) . Successful targeting of immune checkpoints to unleash anti-tumor T cell responses results in durable long-lasting response. However, such cancer immunotherapy helps only in a fraction of patients (7) . Probably the combination of therapies is the most promising and effective approach in the cancer treatment (8) .",

Whereas, in active targeting, the basic concept is to utilize molecular targeting agent to specifically target the biomarkers or receptors on the cancer cells (12;13) .

One of the most used toxins for cancer gene therapy is the Diphtheria toxin (DT) of Corynebacterium diphtheria (14) (15) (16) . DTA belongs to the A-B (Type III) group of exotoxins that catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2 (EF-2), hence arrests protein synthesis and induces cell death (17) . DTA has a very efficient killing activity rate where a single DTA molecule is sufficient to kill the cell (18;19) . Former studies demonstrated selective expression of DTA in tumor cells using a cancer specific promoter (5, (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . The main drawback of this approach is the incomplete specificity of the promoter activity in cancer cells, whereas residual expression resulted in cytotoxic effect also in healthy cells (20;21) . author/funder.

HK022's host recombination site attB is 21 bp long and the phage attP recombination site is over 200 bp long. It is composed of a 21 bp core that is very similar to attB and flanked by two long arms (P and P') that carry binding sites for Int and for some accessory DNA-bending proteins including the bacterial integration host factor (IHF). Integrative attB x attP recombination results in the integration of the phage into the host genome results in a prophage that is flanked by the recombinant attL and attR sites.

One is a recombinase substrate carries toxin gene silenced by a transcription terminator located between two Recombination sites, the second plasmid carries the recombinase gene expressed by a cancer specific promoter. This promoter provides the expression of the recombinase to the cancer cells where it excises the terminator and thus activates the toxin expression (9) (10) (11) . We have shown previously that Int is much less active in eukaryotic cells compare to the Flp and Cre Site specific recombinases that are currently/ widely used for genome manipulations of higher organisms (32) , and unpublished). This fact designates that the activation of a silent substrate of the binary system in case of Int demands considerably higher quantity of this enzyme that is reached only in cancer cells at the high level of activity of the cancer specific promoter. It is not the case in healthy cells where possible leakage of the cancer promoter may lead to basic level of Int expression that is obviously insufficient for such silent substrate activation. In case of much more active recombinase even insignificant level of such basic expression in healthy cells may lead to substrate activation and the toxin expression in the healthy cells. The described Int activity finetuning in the binary system insures the high efficacy safety level in the toxin based cancer therapy technology.

This analysis demonstrated that the level of Bax, Bcl-2 and proCas-3 gene transcription in cancer treated lungs were much higher than in the cancer untreated lungs (Fig.4B) . Moreover, the qRT-PCR analysis also demonstrated an increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in the LLC-Kat cancer lungs treated by the binary system compared to the untreated lungs. Bax/Bcl-2 ratio is described as a cellular `rheostat' of apoptosis sensitivity in the sense that the intracellular ratio of bax/bcl-2 protein can profoundly influence the ability of a cell to respond to an apoptotic signal (54;55) .

Furthermore, inhibition of telomerase activity leads to senescence or apoptosis in tumor cells (59) (60) (61) , indicating that telomerase activity is required for the long-term viability of tumor cells.

The efficiency of the DTA activity was monitored by comparing EGFP expression in surviving cells 48 hours post transfection of each treatment compared to cells transfected by the EGFP plasmid alone. Three cell lines each underwent these five transfections: The first line (HEK293) consisted of immortalized human embryonic kidney cells (Fig. 1B black columns), that unlike normal human cells express a high level of hTERT sufficient to maintain their telomeres indefinitely (41;42). Therefore, hTERT-int expression of the binary system is expected to activate DTA toxicity of the sub plasmid. Quantitative FACS data in this cell line have demonstrated no toxicity in cells transfected with the silent sub alone (91% surviving cells that shows non-significant difference from the positive 100% control with the pEGFP alone) (Fig. 2, black column in Sub). The cells showed strong toxicity (10% surviving cells) with the CMV-dta plasmid and significant and comparable toxicity (47% and 55%) with the mono hTERT-dta and the binary systems (Fig. 1B, black columns). The second treated line (LLC-Kat) also known as Katushka cells, consisted of Lewis lung carcinoma line 1 cells (43) labelled with a far-red mutant of the red fluorescent gene of the sea anemone Entacmaea quadricolor (36;44)",

First, to demonstrate the cancer specific DTA expression in mouse lungs under the conditions described previously, an immunohistochemistry analysis (IHC) by DTA anti-bodies (DTA-Ab) was performed (Figs. 2 and 3). Among the mice treated with the Int-based binary system [Figs. 2 and 3, panels (c)], only the LLC-Kat mice showed substantial DTA positive immune detection [Fig. 3, panels (c, e)] suggesting that is selectively expressed and function in lung cancer cells in vivo in mice model.

The immuno-detection of cleaved Cas-3 (at Asp175) distinguished endogenous levels of the large fragment of activated Cas-3, was clearly detected. Similarly, we detected significant elevation of P53 in the binary system treated mice compare with all other treated mice. P53 is the key regulator of cell cycle and well known to function as apoptotic marker (Figs. 2 and 3, P53) (46). Moreover, an associate significant elevation was also detected with the TUNEL assay (Figs. 2 and 3, TUNEL). TUNEL is a common method for identification of the final stage of apoptotic DNA fragmentation (47). Notably, the absence of apoptotic response was found in the lungs of healthy and LLC-Kat mice treated with the silent dta substrate, demonstrating the low level of apoptosis in these lungs. These results also indicate the absence of DTA leakage [Figs. 2 and 3, panels (b, e)]. Among mice treated with the Int-based binary system only the LLC-Kat ones showed the substantial immune detection by IHC for Cas-3, P-53 and TUNEL, suggesting high specificity of the binary system toward cancer cells [Fig. 3, panels (c, e)]. Unanticipated positive immune detection has been received in both types of mice treated with the hTERT-dta plasmid [Figs. 2 and 3, panels (d, e)]. Comparative quantitative analysis of the immune detected levels of the Cas-3, P53 and TUNEL in the lung specimens of LLC-Kat mice of Int-based binary and hTERT-dta mono systems has revealed six, five and nine folds respectively higher in the proposed binary system than the mono system [Fig. 3, panels (e)]. Finally, analysis of Int-based binary system for DTA expression has revealed its safety efficacy in the healthy mice [Fig. 2, panels (e)] along with significant killing activity in LLC-Kat lung cancer ones [Fig. 3, panels (e)] compare to the mono hTERT-dta system.Having demonstrated the Int-based binary system killing activity of cancer cells in vivo as a result of selectivity expression of DTA in cancer cells we wanted to visualize the DTA expression in cancer author/funder.

Western blot analysis was executed using the antibodies against apoptotic protein markers, such as cleavedCas-3 and activated/phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK-Ph) (48;49), antibodies against proliferation marker: phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK-Ph) (50;51) and the antibodies used as positive controls: Katushka and Actin.

Intriguingly, among all four LLC-Kat lung cancer mice groups only the group treated with hTERTdta plasmid showed Mad1 positive immune detection [panels (d)] justifying the regulatory interfering hypothesis: the exogenous active hTERT promoter repression occurs as a result of the Mad1 transcription factor elevation [Fig. 5, B, panels(d, e)]. Comparative quantitative analysis of Mad1 in LLC-Kat mice lungs between Int-based binary and the mono systems has revealed 33 fold increasing Mad1 expression level in the lungs treated with hTERT-dta plasmid [Fig. 5, B, panel (e)]. As shown in the results the comparative quantitative analysis of DTA expression level in healthy and LLC-Kat mice lungs treated with hTERT-dta plasmid has revealed an unexpected 11 folds increasing DTA level in healthy mice (Figs. 2, 3, e).This unforeseen result can be explained by the Mad1 down regulation effect. Indeed, the analysis of Mad1 expression level in healthy and LLC-Kat mice lungs treated with hTERT-dta plasmid has revealed six folds increasing Mad1 level in LLC-Kat mice [Fig. 5, A, B, panels(e)] that led to more efficient down regulation of hTERT and as a result to more efficient DTA synthesis repression.",
