            "text": "Idiopathic hyperlipidemia (IH) is a common condition in Miniature Schnauzers (MS), with more than 75% of dogs = 9 years old being affected and >45% of these dogs having moderate to severe fasting hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) with or without combined hypercholesterolemia (HCHOL). Severe HTG poses an increased risk for the development of several conditions (e.g., pancreatitis, insulin resistance). Recent studies in humans suggest IH to be associated with low-grade inflammation involved in the pathogenesis of diseases associated with IH. The risk of such complications decreases with medical control of IH. Given that biomarkers of inflammation have not been investigated in MS with IH, the aims of the study were to evaluate serum calprotectin and S100A12 concentrations (i) in healthy MS and in MS with IH, and (ii) in MS with IH in response to dietary intervention for the management of IH. Serum samples were collected from 152 clinically healthy MS, and a study questionnaire was completed for each dog to confirm the health status and medication history. Serum triglyceride, cholesterol, calprotectin, and S100A12 concentrations were measured in all samples. Paired serum samples were obtained from 17 of the IH dogs after being placed on a commercial ultra-low fat diet without any additional lipid-lowering medications. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric (paired or unpaired) group comparisons and Fisher's exact or likelihood ratio tests, with statistical significance set at P < 0.05.",

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) in dogs is diagnosed by observing serum canine trypsin-like immunoreactivity (cTLI) to be <2.5 \u00b5g/L; affected dogs have severe fat malabsorption. Some dogs with signs of EPI have marginally subnormal serum cTLI (3-6 \u00b5g/ L) and do not respond to enzyme replacement therapy (subclinical EPI, SEPI), but given their clinical signs, abnormal serum cobalamin or folate, and absence of other detectable non-enteric disease presumably have an idiopathic chronic enteropathy (ICE). Unpublished preliminary data indicate decreased serum tocopherol concentrations in dogs with EPI that do not resolve after pancreatic enzyme supplementation. The objectives of this study were to measure serum tocopherol and retinol in dogs with EPI and those with subclinical EPI and ICE (SEPI/ICE). Inclusion criteria for the EPI group (n = 8) were clinical signs of EPI and serum cTLI concentrations <2.5 \u00b5g/L. Dogs in the SEPI/ICE group (n = 9) had clinical signs of ICE and serum cTLI concentrations in the 3.0-6.0 \u00b5g/L range.

            "text": "ESCG -O -3 EFFECT OF MIRTAZAPINE ON CANINE GASTRIC EMPTY-ING ASSESSED BY 13C-SODIUM ACETATE BREATH TEST (13C-SABT). N. Schleifenbaum 1 , S. Salavati 2 , R. Neiger 1 . 1 Small Animal Clinic -Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Giessen, Germany, 2 The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and The R, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK Delayed gastric emptying is suspected to occur in several common conditions in dogs, for example metabolic/ -endocrine disorders or inflammatory bowel disease. It can also be a sequela in critical care patients suffering from sepsis, peritonitis or pancreatitis. Treating the underlying cause is indicated, but additional supportive treatment in the form of prokinetic drugs is scarce, especially as 5-HT4 receptor agonists are not widely available. The antidepressant mirtazapine, routinely used at low dosages for its appetite stimulating properties in small animals, has been reported to accelerate gastric emptying both in people and (at high dosages) in experimental healthy dogs. The effects of mirtazapine on gastric emptying times using a non-invasive test have not been assessed. Hence, assessing the effect of different dosages of this drug on gastric half emptying times (G50%) in healthy dogs using the 13 C-SABT was sought. Six healthy Beagle dogs (3-5 years, 9.7-11 .6 kg body weight) were included. Mirtazapine was used at increasing dosages (0.6 mg/kg = MLo, 2 mg/kg = MMe, 20 mg/kg = MHi). Initially, MLo, placebo and prucalopride (1 mg/kg as a positive control) were administered orally in a cross-over design. Subsequently, MMe and MHi were administered and compared to a second and third placebo treatment. This approach was chosen to enable interim analysis of data, as ethical approval only allowed to progress to a higher mirtazapine dose if no effect was seen with the lower one. On day 4 of each treatment, a test meal consisting of each dog's half daily calorie requirement and 150 mg 13 C-sodium acetate was fed after an overnight fast and a 13 C-SABT was performed. Breath samples were obtained with a facial mask before (0 min) and 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 , and 360 min after test meal ingestion. 12 CO 2 / 13 CO 2 ratio in the breath was measured by nondispersive infrared spectroscopy and delta-over baseline (DOB) values plotted against time. G50% was calculated for each treatment based on cumulative non-linear curve fitting of the DOB values. Median G50% was 78.3 min (range 48.4-93. 3) with MLo, ) with MMed and 106.4 min (range 83. 1-144. 2) with MHi. Median G50% for Prucalopride and for placebo was 61.9 min (43. .0) and 67.1 min (38. 1-146.1) respectively.",

Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a prevalent and fatal cause of canine enteritis often exacerbated by concurrent infection with other enteropathogens. Persistent isolation of Salmonella spp. during hospital environmental surveys of the isolation ward prompted further investigation. This study was designed to determine the comparative prevalence of CD and Salmonella spp. in dogs with CPV and healthy dogs. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Pretoria and conducted from October 2015 to March 2017. Fresh fecal samples were collected from dogs aged 6 weeks to 9 months diagnosed and admitted with CPV infection, and healthy dogs presented for vaccination or routine hospital procedures. CPV shedding was confirmed using negative staining electron microscopy. CD was detected via commercial fecal antigen enzyme immunoassay for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), TcdA and TcdB.

A comprehensive investigation of virulence genes in E.coli strains from dogs diagnosed with IBD was performed using a 17panel multiplex PCR, targeting for 8 genes typical for human IBD-associated adherent and invasive E. coli [Group 1 genes: eaeH, irp2, fimH, ratA, fepC, usp, colV, dsbA] and 9 genes more typically associated with ExPEC [Group 2 genes: cvaC, ompTp, hlyF, etaB, iss, aerJ, ereA, papC] (Johnson, TJ, JMicrobiol 2008) . A cohort of 12 German Shepherd Dogs (GSDs) and 20 non-GSDs diagnosed with lympho-plasmacytic IBD on the basis of clinical signs, intestinal histopathology, and exclusion of other known causes of chronic gastro-intestinal signs was enrolled. E. coli was cultured from endoscopically collected biopsies using MacConkey and Sheep Blood agar, and identified using API20E (BioM erieux). Statistical analysis was performed using univariate linear mixed effect models and Fisher's exact tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The following dependent variables were considered: (i) clinical activity of disease (CCECAI; Allenspach K 2007), (ii) histological severity score (WSAVA index; Day M 2008)), (iii) use of immunosuppressive agents, and (iv) euthanasia due to intractable IBD or survival within 1 year after diagnosis. Results revealed that none of the tested virulence factors were significantly associated with the CCECAI index. However, one virulence factor from group 1 [colV:colicin V, antimicrobial peptide; P = 0.03) had a significant effect on the WSAVA index. Two of the virulence genes typically associated with ExPEC (Group 2: ompTP: inactivates antimicrobials, and cvaC: secreted toxin resulting in cytolysis) were significantly associated with euthanasia due to intractable IBD (ompTP: OR: 19, cvaC: OR: 30, P = 0.05), as well as an increased likelihood of having been treated with immunosuppressives (P = 0.03). These data are reminiscent of reports on human ulcerative colitis cases harboring mucosal E. coli with multiple ExPEC virulence factors that were associated with clinical severity. Similarly, our data indicate that specific microbial factors may be important determinants and predictors of disease progression and survival in a sub-group of dogs with IBD.",

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is common in the English Cocker Spaniel (ECS), and is characterized histologically by duct destruction, interlobular fibrosis and dense periductular and perivenous lymphocytic aggregates. These changes are characteristic of human autoimmune pancreatitis type 1, part of a steroid-responsive, multi-organ syndrome, newly recognized as IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD). Human IgG4-RD affects one or several organs, often showing a predominance of IgG4+ plasma cells histologically, with an IgG4+/total IgG+ plasma cell ratio >40%. This study investigated whether ECSs with CP and inflammatory disease in several organs show an increase in IgG4+ plasma cells within affected tissues. Histological sections of pancreas (n = 12), liver (n = 10), kidney (n = 12), salivary gland (n = 4), anal sacs (n = 9), and conjunctiva (n = 2) were obtained from 37 ECSs with idiopathic chronic inflammatory disease affecting those tissues.

In human medicine, sonographically identifying a distended, non-compliant caudal vena cava (CVC) is a non-invasive means of detecting R-CHF and/or estimating intravascular volume. Sonographic CVC dimensions in healthy dogs have been reported. However, the effect of R-CHF on CVC dimensions is not well described. The objective of this study was to determine if CVC measurements, obtained via three different sonographic views, from dogs with R-CHF are outside reference intervals (RI). Dogs presenting with right-sided heart disease and ascites were prospectively evaluated. Via longitudinal subxiphoid views (SV), maximal and minimal CVC diameter (SV-CVCMax, expiration, SV-CVCMin, inspiration) and collapsibility index (CI) were measured. Transverse 11-13 th right hepatic intercostal views (HV) were used to measure maximal and minimal CVC (HV-CVCMax, HV-CVCMin) and aortic diameter. A single CVC and aortic diameter (PV-CVC, PV-Ao) were measured via longitudinal right paralumbar views (PV).

The aim of our study was to describe the inheritance pattern and to identify potentially causative gene mutations in our population. Study population consisted of 12 Labradors. Eight dog was diagnosed with different severity of the disease, one was a 13 years old healthy littermate in an affected family, three dogs (>10 years old) from different breed lines served as controls. Clinical diagnosis was made by electrocardiography and echocardiography. Inheritance pattern was studied by pedigree analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples using a commercial kit. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of healthy and diseased littermates was used to identify candidate mutations (Illumina HiSeq2500 next generation sequencing system, Agilent Sure Select Canine All Exon 54 Mb librarykit, 50x-coverage, CanFam3.1 annotation). Selection of target mutations in genes related to calcium transport was based on clinical experience with calcium channel blocker diltiazem, that could effectively control the disease. Sanger-sequencing was used to validate WES results in the study population and in controls (ABI3500 capillary-sequencing system, BigDye3.1 chemistry). The disease was present in all generations (affecting both genders) of the affected Labrador family, although the symptoms varied among the individuals. Sudden death at young age occurred in the offsprings of parents that were both clinically affected. Development of congestive heart failure between 5 and 8 years of age due to tachycardiomyopathy was another observed phenotype, while there were also some clinically asymptomatic dogs with or without the arrhythmia. In early stages of ARVC, diagnosis is difficult due to the absence of echocardiographic changes and day-to-day arrhythmia variability. A definitive diagnosis requires histopathologic identification of transmural fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricle. Reduction of immunofluorescent signal for the desmosomal protein plakoglobin has been reported in ARVC-affected humans and boxers. Reduction in plakoglobin signal within endomyocardial biopsy samples (EMBs) may help diagnose ARVC.",

Oregon State University, Corvallis, USA Accurate assessment of right ventricular (RV) structure and function is an integral component of a complete cardiology evaluation in veterinary patients. Assessment of RV performance is particularly important in patients with pulmonary hypertension, congenital heart disease, and acquired myocardial disease affecting the RV. There is evidence in human medicine suggesting RV function is strongly associated with outcomes in many conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of right ventricular volume (RVV) and function quantification using three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) compared to electrocardiogram-gated multidetector computed tomography (ECG-gated MDCT). Six intact hound cross dogs weighing between 19.5-23.8 kg were anesthetized using a standardized protocol and spontaneous ventilation. Each dog underwent an ECG-gated MDCT and complete 3DE examination. Right ventricular end-diastolic volumes (EDV), end-systolic volumes (ESV), stroke volume (SV), and ejection fraction (EF) were measured using software specific for RVV quantification from 3DE and MDCT data sets. Correlation and levels of agreement between methods were determined, and intra-and interobserver variability was assessed for 3DE.",

We tested the hypothesis that 2D-STE may detect left ventricular systolic dysfunction, not diagnosed by conventional echocardiography, in dogs with SIRS. Seventeen dogs with evidence of SIRS and 17 healthy dogs as a control group were included in this prospective study. All the procedures were performed for diagnostic purpose; the control group was composed of healthy dogs undergoing surgical castration or ovariohysterectomy. We excluded from the study breeds predisposed to dilated cardiomyopathy, pregnant females, dogs treated with opioids, sedatives or anesthetic drugs during the 12 h before echocardiography. We also excluded dogs with previous diagnosis of, or echocardiographic evidence of congenital or acquired cardiac disease and dogs with an arrhythmia. At the time of Hospital admission each dog was submitted to standard 2D, M-mode, Doppler and 2D-STE with simultaneous ECG and blood pressure measurement. Furthermore, blood samples were obtained for CBC, biochemical profile and the measurements of cTnI and CRP serum levels. The results showed that the standard echocardiographic indices of systolic function such as EF, FS were not significantly different between the two groups. On the contrary, the Left Ventricular Global Longitudinal Peak Strain of endomyocardial layer and the STE-derived Ejection Fraction (STE-EF) were significantly lower in the SIRS group than in the control group. We did not find significant correlation between CRP serum levels and 2D-STE variables and between cTnI and STE variables. Furthermore we did not find a significant difference in cTnI serum levels between the two groups. Our study demonstrated that 2D-STE was more sensitive than standard echocardiography in detecting early or mild to moderate myocardial dysfunction, not detected by conventional echocardiography, in a population of dogs with SIRS.

However, genetic factors contributing to development or progression of the disease are unknown. Although classically considered a non-inflammatory disease, upregulated expression of genes involved in inflammation and immune function has been identified in affected valvular tissue. Therefore, genetic determinants of the immune response could influence disease progression in individual dogs.

Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), an adult cardiac progenitor cell population, are the most promising candidates for cellular therapy. Their application in rodent models and phase 1 human trials of ischemic myocardial disease showed promise measured by increased left ventricular function. However, much remains unknown about their basic biology, especially in dogs. To expand this treatment to treat canine dilated cardiomyopathy requires the creation of cryopreserved allogeneic cell banks since this allows timely access to large cell numbers and avoids obtaining diseased autologous myocardial tissue from potentially unstable dogs. However, CDCs in culture conditions are subject to plasticity similar to other adult stem cell populations. We therefore investigated how passage number or cryopreservation may affect cellular potency of CDCs obtained from canine atrial explants. CDCs were isolated and characterized from five cadavers with consent. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated for comparison. CDCs demonstrated a population doubling time that was slower than MSCs (P < 0.05) but importantly was unchanged by cryopreservation (P = 0.71). Cryopreserved CDCs also demonstrated the same multi-lineage potential as fresh cells by showing commitment to myocardial, endothelial and smooth muscle lineages and maintained the ability to form clonal colonies. Flow cytometry analysis revealed fresh CDCs had a high proportion of cells expressing CD105 (89.0% AE 4.98) and CD44 (99.68% AE 0.13) with varying proportions of CD90 + (23.36% AE 9.78), CD34 + (7.18% AE 4.03) and c-Kit + (13.17% AE 8.67) cells. CD45 + (0.015% AE 0.005) and CD29 + (2.92% AE 2.46) populations were negligible. Increasing passage number correlated with an increase in the proportion of CD34 + cells and a decrease in CD90 + cells (P = 0.003 and 0.03 respectively). Cryopreserved populations displayed increased positive populations for CD34 (P < 0.001) and fewer CD90 + cells (P = 0.042).",

Mixed breed dogs were under-represented. PC at the Cardiology Service, ascites upon presentation, an idiopathic CT, and pericardiectomy, were associated with a higher, while pallor and an inability to ambulate upon presentation were associated with a lower 30-day survival rate. Survival rates did not differ between dogs undergoing PC from the right or the left hemithorax. Survival rates did not differ between dogs undergoing a single and those undergoing several PCs. However, median time-intervals from the first-to-second and from the second-to-third PCs were significantly longer in survivors compared to non-survivors (35 vs. 9, P = 0.001, and 21 vs. 5 days, P = 0.04, respectively). Two dogs died prior to PC completion. Seven dogs had an underlying myxomatous mitral valve disease. Four of these were Dachshunds, of which three had a left atrial-wall rupture leading to an acute, hemorrhagic CT. In the remaining three, the pericardial effusate was a modified transudate. In 31 dogs the drained effusate volume in the first PC significantly and positively correlated (r = 0.77, P < 0.0001) with the pre-PC sonographic apex-to-pericardial distance. There was no association between apex-to-pericardial distance (P = 0.086) or volume of fluid drained during PC (P = 0.5) with the 30-day survival. Generally, dogs presenting with CT have a poor long-term prognosis. However, Golden retrievers, dogs selected for surgical pericardiectomy, those that present with ascites, without pallor, and are ambulatory and those with longer inter-pericardiocentesis intervals have higher survival rates. Survival rate is not affected by the side of hemithorax from which pericardiocentesis is performed. The total atrial conduction time is an independent predictor of atrial fibrillation (AF) in humans. It can be estimated by pulsedwave tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) by measuring the time from onset of the P wave until the peak of A' velocity of the lateral left atrial wall (P-PA'). A prolongation of P-PA' identifies people at high risk of development of AF. This study investigated echocardiographic variables (including P-PA' measured with Color TDI) which may identify dogs which developed AF within 6 months. All dogs with AF were retrospectively reviewed. Those that developed a new-onset AF within 6 months after previous echo were included in the AF group. Dogs with underlying cardiac disease that did not develop AF within 6 months after echo were also reviewed and included in the non-AF group. The non-AF group were selected to have similar body weight (BW) and left atrial dilatation (2D LA:Ao) to the AF group. P-PA' durations were measured offline from archived color TDI images by placing the region of interest over the interatrial septum (color P-PA' IAS ) and lateral left atrial wall (color P-PA' lateral ). P-PA' durations and echo variables of 2D, M-Mode and pulsed-wave TDI (S', E' and A' velocities) were compared between groups. Receiving operator characteristic curves were used to identify the best AF predictor. 65 dogs were included (22 AF; 43 non-AF). Degenerative mitral valve disease and dilated cardiomyopathy were the most frequent cardiac diseases in both groups. Risk of new-onset AF was not associated with a specific breed, gender, neutering status, or cardiac disease. BW, LA:Ao and color P-PA' IAS were not significantly different between groups. The AF group had significantly greater left-ventricular (LV) end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) volumes, M-Mode LV ED and ES diameters, LV ES diameter indexed for body weight, LV ES volume indexed to body surface area (ESVi), LA maximal diameter (LA max ) and color P-PA' lateral . The variables with highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) were P-PA' lateral (0.8), LA max (0.73), and ESVi (0.70).

The prevalence of dog obesity is increasing and a better understanding of the metabolism of overweight dogs is needed to improve obesity prevention and treatment. This study aim to detect and quantify plasma metabolites during a feed challenge-test in dogs and to identify alterations in the metabolism related to overweight. Twenty-eight healthy intact male Labrador retriever dogs were included, 12 of which were classified as lean (body condition score (BCS) 4-5 on a 9-point scale) and 16 as overweight (BCS 6-8). After overnight fasting, plasma samples were collected and dogs were fed a high-fat meal. Postprandial plasma samples were collected hourly for 4 h. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was conducted and 41 plasma metabolites were statistically evaluated. The results showed that all postprandial time points differed from the fasting time point in multivariate discriminant analysis (cross-validated ANOVA: P = 0.00014). Eleven specific metabolites with peak concentrations mainly at 2 or 3 h postprandially contributed to the separations. Carnitine was identified as a metabolite related to overweight at all time points in stepwise logistic regression analysis (P = 0.03) and overweight dogs had lower carnitine response in a mixed model repeated measures analysis (P = 0.005). Notably, the fasting carnitine concentration in overweight dogs (mean AE SD, 9.4 AE 4.2 mM) was very close to a proposed reference limit for carnitine deficiency. These findings demonstrate that NMR is suitable for metabolic evaluations in feed-challenges in dogs. The lowered carnitine concentration in overweight dogs warrants further investigation as it could indicate carnitine deficiency and an altered lipid metabolism in overweight dogs.",

Additionally, the dog regularly consumed feces of feral rabbits on its daily walks since more than 2 years. The analysis of a sample of such feces showed that it contained high amounts of insoluble ash (7% of fresh matter or 12.3% vs. 4% dry matter in pet rabbits). The intake of such feces together with soil sticking to it might have caused silica uroliths in this case, since no signs of dysuria or abnormal ultrasonographic examinations of the bladder or urinalysis did recur after the dog was kept from consuming rabbit feces for more than three month.

Serum samples were collected before surgery from 23 dogs with adrenal tumors and in one dog with an extra-adrenal neuroendocrine tumor. All tumors and their tissue origin were confirmed by histopathology. There were 12 catecholamine-producing tumors (11 pheochromocytomas, 1 extra-adrenal tumor), and 12 adrenocortical tumors. Serum concentrations of vasostatin and catestatin were analyzed by a radioimmunoassay (RIA) that has previously been validated for the use in dogs. Statistical analysis was performed with a non-parametric test using the software R version 3.0.2.",

Serial blood samples of 219 cats were recruited (two samples: 103 cats; three: 55; four: 44; \u2265 five: 17). Sixty-two (28.3 %) cats had at least one IGF-1 measurement >1000 ng/mL (median 1576 ng/mL, range 1001->2000); a median of 0.6 units/kg/injection insulin (range 0-2.4) was administered.

Median subsequent IGF-1 increase was 594 ng/mL (range 71-1495), having initially received a median of 73 days of insulin treatment (range 25-154). Basal endogenous insulin in untreated diabetic cats with IGF-1 <1000 ng/mL (n = 106; median 29.0 ng/L, range 9.2-791) was significantly lower than in those with IGF-1 >1000 ng/mL (n = 15; median 64.2 ng/L, range 9.2-490; P = 0.024).

In this study, approximately 1 in 10 newly diagnosed diabetic cats with an IGF-1 suggestive of underlying HS, based on the currently advocated cut-off, will initially show a negative value using this cut-off.

Based on light microscopy, diabetic cats have reduced number of beta-cells but whether secretory granules and mitochondria, which are central to cellular function and viability, have abnormal morphology is unknown. Furthermore, a recent investigation questioned the role of islet amyloid in the pathogenesis of diabetes in cats since its amount did not differ between diabetic and age-matched control cats. However, intracellular aggregation of amylin into oligomers, rather than extracellular amyloid, may be the principle of beta-cell toxicity in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the aims of the study were to characterize ultrastructural lesions of beta-cells in diabetic cats with emphasis on granules, mitochondria and intracellular amylin aggregation. Pancreases of diabetic and control cats euthanized for any disease were prospectively collected. Samples were harvested within 1 h from death and glutaraldehyde-fixed. Control cats were selected to be matched for age, sex and body weight. Sections were prepared for electron microscopy and immunogold labeling by using antiinsulin and anti-amylin antibodies. Beta-cell morphology was assessed, including beta-cell granule area, eccentricity (minimum-tomaximum diameter ratio), granule number, as well as beta-cell mitochondrial area, number and inter-cristae distance.

Dr Hanson has received European Society Endocrinology/Dechra Veterinary Products travel grant for researchers in veterinary endocrinology, and financial support from the Foundation for Research, Agria Insurance Company, the Swedish Research Council, and Thure F and Karin Forsbergs Stiftelse. Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrinopathies in dogs. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism relies upon measurement of basal plasma concentrations of total thyroxine (T 4 ) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). A low plasma T 4 combined with a high plasma TSH points to primary hypothyroidism. However, 30-38% of hypothyroid dogs have TSH values within the reference range. Consequently, a low plasma total T 4 concentration in combination with a plasma TSH concentration within the reference range does not distinguish between dogs with hypothyroidism and dogs with non-thyroidal illness (NTI). A potential interesting observation from previous studies (Lee et al; 2001, and Diaz-Espi\u00f1eira et al; 2008) is that hypothyroidism in dogs is associated with increased release of growth hormone (GH).",

The RECOVER initiative has generated interest regarding the poor prognosis for veterinary patients suffering cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and produced evidence-based guidelines for their care. There is, however, scant documentation of post-discharge outcomes for animals that survive. This study aimed to describe mortality associated with in-hospital CPA, determine median survival time of dogs and cats that survive CPA, and examine the incidence and persistence of acquired neurological deficits. Medical records of animals that underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) at a referral centre were reviewed. Factors examined included species and age, managing department, location in hospital of arrest, primary disease process, closed versus open CPR, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), time to death, and cause of death. Where survivors to discharge were identified, the animal's primary care veterinarian was contacted for provision of medical records following discharge. A total of 241 animals underwent CPR (196 dogs and 45 cats) with 116 (48%) animals achieving ROSC and 29 of 41 (12%) surviving to discharge. Complete medical records were obtained for 79% (23/29) of survivors. Five of 29 (17%) had neurological deficits including depressed mentation, ataxia, circling and blindness on leaving hospital. All had either complete resolution or significant improvement of neurologic deficits within one month. Eight animals (35%) died following discharge prior to completion of the study period, however two were excluded from analysis as they were discharged explicitly for a palliative visit. The remaining six animals had a median survival time of 1284 days (502-1508 days). Fifteen animals (65%) were alive on completion of the study, with a median of 1362 days following discharge (162-2901). The proportion of animals surviving to discharge was similar to that reported in the veterinary literature. Whilst the immediate prognosis for animals undergoing CPA is poor, for animals surviving to discharge life expectancy is reasonable and the prognosis good for improvement of acquired neurological deficits. Feline primary erythrocytosis (PE) is a rare myeloproliferative disorder causing excessive increase in packed cell volume (PCV). Veterinary literature is sparse with isolated reports and minimal information regarding prognosis. We evaluated a retrospective multicentre case series of feline PE, with the aim of increasing understanding of disease progression to guide management and prognostication. Theories of possible underlying genetic causes were evaluated by comparing the natural history of feline PE to human polycythemia vera (PV). Cases required documentation of increased PCV (>48%), sufficient investigation to exclude relative and secondary erythrocytosis, and follow-up data for at least twelve months or until death.",

Given that no etiologies have been identified for CIPF, the objective of this study was to investigate a potential fungal cause. A conventional panfungal PCR assay targeting the conserved rDNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of fungi, using two primer pairs (ITS1-ITS2, ITS1-ITS4) was performed using DNA extracted from lung tissue samples from WHWTs affected with CIPF (n = 26) and age-matched unaffected controls (n = 14). DNA of soil Aspergillus fumigatus isolates were included as positive controls. Water samples were tested as negative controls. Additionally, serum samples from 8 WHWTs affected with CIPF and 8 age-matched unaffected WHWTs were tested for precipitins against 10 species of environmental fungus using electrosyneresis on cellulose acetate. Fungal ITS1-ITS2 and ITS1-ITS4 sequences were not amplified from any lung sample, suggesting that invasive fungal infection or heavy colonization is unlikely in CIPF. On the other hand, results of the serological assay revealed the presence of \u2265 2 arcs of precipitins (indicative of a positive result) in 55 of the 160 reactions tested (35 positive results in CIPF population vs. 20 in controls, P = 0.013), supporting an increased prevalence of environmental fungal exposure in CIPF dogs compared with controls. For Lichtheimia corymbifera, a commonly involved antigen in human farmer's lung hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the number of precipitin arcs was significantly higher in CIPF dogs in comparison with controls (P = 0.04). Whether this finding reflects a lung sensitization to fungal allergens and is involved in the pathogenesis of CIPF warrants further investigation.",

In humans, deviation from a core airway microbiota is thought to predispose to development, exacerbation or progression of respiratory diseases.

The gut microbiota influences microbial communities at distant sites. However, as asthma is a localized disease, we hypothesized that it would result in decreased richness and diversity of the lower airway microbiota, contributing to a state of dysbiosis, while the fecal microbiota would remain unaffected.

Cough is a protective mechanism, promoting clearance of the respiratory tract, while also contributing to pathology of clinical disease; as such, it is a both a marker for and target of therapeutic intervention. Cough assessment in dogs is subjective, generally based on owner's perceptions. An objective method of evaluation is needed. In humans, acoustic cough monitoring provides objective data on cough number and intensity by examining acoustic waveforms. We hypothesized that healthy dogs would demonstrate cough waveforms which could be distinguished from other acoustic behaviors (AB); whine, bark, growl, lick, drink, chew and throat-clear. Data were obtained from 10 healthy employee-owned dogs with informed consent. Acoustic behaviors were recorded using a CTA-laryngeal-microphone and analyzed using RavenPro \u00a9 bioacoustics analysis software for AB duration, peak amplitude and frequency, time to peak amplitude and frequency, power, and energy. Inter-and intra-group statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA on ranks with P < 0.05 being significant. With the exception of throat-clear, cough was distinguished from every other evaluated AB by one or more of the analyzed waveform parameters (P < 0.001). No between-subject differences were identified between cough and throat-clear groups for any waveform parameter. All other behaviors showed statistically significant within-group variation (P < 0.001). Cough and throatclear (a clinically similar mechanism to protect the airways) have repeatable acoustic features that are distinguishable from other common AB and are consistent between dogs. Acoustic monitoring may provide an objective means for evaluating cough in dogs with respiratory disease and assessing response to therapeutic intervention.",

Increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and decreased muscle mass make identification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in hyperthyroid cats challenging. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is a promising indirect renal biomarker that correlates closely with GFR in healthy geriatric and CKD cats. The aim of this study was to evaluate SDMA reliability as a renal biomarker in hyperthyroid cats. Forty-seven client-owned hyperthyroid nonazotemic (creatinine <168 lmol/L) cats were prospectively enrolled and treated with radioiodine ( 131 I). Antithyroid medication was discontinued 10 days prior to 131 I treatment. Cats had to be free of any other medication at least for 14 days prior to 131 I treatment and free of any other clinically relevant systemic disease. Creatinine and SDMA (IDEXX SDMA TM Test) were determined before (T0) and 1 month after (T1) treatment. GFR (plasma exogenous creatinine clearance test) was measured at T0 and T1 in 10 of 47 cats. As expected, creatinine significantly increased (P < 0.001) and GFR significantly decreased (P < 0.001) after 131 I treatment. SDMA did not significantly change over time (P = 0.37). Only 1 cat became azotemic (creatinine >168 lmol/L) at T1 while having normal SDMA at both time points. SDMA was elevated (>14 lg/dL) in 6 of 47 cats at T0 and normalized after treatment in 4 cats. GFR was available in 1 of these 6 cats and was within normal limits (SDMA normalized at T1). SDMA at T1 was increased above 14 lg/dL in 1 cat with borderline low GFR which was defined as GFR <1.9 ml/min/kg. Pearson correlation (n = 10) between GFR and SDMA was moderate to low (r = \u00c00.48, P = 0.16 at T0 and r = \u00c00.36, P = 0.31 at T1) and correlation between GFR and creatinine was moderate (r = \u00c00.54, P = 0.11 at T0 and r = \u00c00.51, P = 0.13 at T1). Forty of forty-one cats with pre-treatment SDMA within reference interval remained non-azotemic post-treatment. However, not enough patients became azotemic post-treatment to evaluate if SDMA can predict post-treatment renal azotemia.

Urine samples from healthy dogs, dogs with lower urinary tract disease (LUTD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI) and at risk for AKI, were collected. Urine concentrations of IL-6 and 18 were measured using ELISA and corrected to urinary creatinine (uIL-6.18/uCr). Sixtysix dogs were included. There was a positive correlation between IL-6 and IL-18 (P < 0.001, r: \u00c00.65). Median uIL-6/uCr of healthy, LUTD, CKD, AKI and dogs at risk were 0.026 pg/mg (range:0.01-2.28), 0.04 pg/mg (range:0.02-2.93), 0.08 pg/mg (range:0.04-8.28), 0.46 pg/mg (range:0.06-58.05) and 6.5 pg/mg (range:0.04-19.74) respectively.

There was a significant difference in uIL-6/uCr and uIL-18/uCr among the study groups, with both higher in the AKI group compared with other groups, except uIL-18/uCr, which was not different between the AKI and CKD groups. Median uIL-6/uCr and uIL-18/uCr of dogs at risk for AKI, were higher compared with healthy dogs (P = 0.034, P = 0.045 respectively). ROC analysis of uIL-6/uCr and uIL-18/ uCr as AKI predictors had an area under the curve of 0.85 and 0.78 respectively. uIL-6/uCr and uIL-18/uCr cut-off points of 0.11 and 0.13 were associated with sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 70% respectively, and 83% and 70% respectively. In conclusion, IL-6 and IL-18 are sensitive and specific markers of AKI AKI is associated with high mortality, partially due to its late recognition using available markers. Current research aims to identify new AKI biomarkers, however, their specificity is hampered when these are also expressed in extra-renal tissues.",

Comorbidities on the date of the respective urine culture were retrieved from the dogs' medical records. E. coli strains were recovered from frozen storage banks and subjected to whole genome sequencing. The core genome of study strains was compared to reference strain ABU83097 and multi-locus sequence types (MLST) were identified. Strain resistomes were determined by searching genomes for 38 known antibiotic resistance genes. Seventy-six E. coli strains from 19 dogs were analyzed. All dogs had conditions that predisposed to UTI and were treated with antibiotics after positive urine cultures. The number of examined E. coli strains per individual dog ranged from 2 to 8 (median 3.5); they had originally been recovered over a median time span of 146.5 days (range 9-2450 days).

Dogs with naturally occurring parvovirus infection may be at risk of developing acute kidney injury due to several risk factors, including severe dehydration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and sepsis. Early detection of kidney injury is important, yet challenging, because conventional renal parameters, such as serum creatinine (sCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), are insensitive markers for early stages of kidney injury and dysfunction. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate potential kidney injury in dogs with naturally occurring parvoviral infection by comparing standard to novel urinary biomarkers. Twenty-two dogs with parvoviral infection were prospectively enrolled and compared with eight clinically healthy control dogs. Blood and urine samples were collected at presentation (T 0 ) in both groups and 24 h later (T 1 ) in the patient group. Urinary immunoglobulin G (uIgG) and C-reactive protein (uCRP) were measured to document glomerular injury, whereas urinary retinolbinding protein (uRBP) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) served as biomarkers for tubular injury. These biomarkers were compared to routine renal functional parameters, including sCr, BUN, urinary protein:creatinine ratio (UPC), and urine specific gravity (USG).

Gum arabic coated radioactive gold nanoparticles AuNP) are effectively retained and result in 80% tumor reduction in a mouse model of human prostatic carcinoma. Our objectives were to determine the toxicity and preliminary efficacy of AuNP administered intralesionally to dogs with spontaneously occurring carcinoma of the prostate. The hypothesis was that intralesional AuNP would cause short term swelling but cause no systemic toxicity and result in tumor stabilization or shrinkage. Following Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval, dogs with a diagnosis of prostate carcinoma without bladder involvement were eligible for enrollment with informed owner consent. Staging was performed and injection of AuNP was achieved with CT guidance (100-200 lL per site in multiple sites, total amount varied based on tumor size). A complete blood count, chemistry panel, and urinalysis were performed weekly for 4 weeks following treatment; a CT scan was performed 4 weeks after treatment. Nuclear scintigraphy was performed regularly (15 min, 1 h, 4 h, 1, 2, 4, and 5 days post-injection) to determine the degree of retention of AuNP in the prostate. Following the 4 week trial period, chemotherapy could be started at the discretion of the pet owner. Twenty-two dogs were enrolled; 3 dogs had metastasis to the lymph nodes in the sublumbar region and 19 dogs had no evidence of metastasis. Two dogs were treated to a biologically equivalent dose of 50 Gy and 20 dogs were treated to 105 Gy. One dog died 12 days post injection due to urethral obstruction from either tumor swelling or disease progression. Following this event, dogs with evidence of urethral obstruction had urethral stents placed (n = 15) prior to treatment. Fifteen dogs received chemotherapy. The median survival time of dogs receiving chemotherapy was 132 days (range 55-420 days) compared to 56 days (range 12-255 days) in dogs that did not. The average tumor retention of AuNP was 70% at 5 days post-injection; loss occurred into the urine through the bladder. No accumulation of dose was found in heart, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney as determined by whole body planar imaging up to 5 days posttreatment. The median reduction in tumor volume was 10% one month after AuNP therapy in 14 dogs. In conclusion, intratumoral administration of AuNP caused no acute systemic toxicities in any dog and may be effective in decreasing tumor size, however, local tumor swelling is possible and dogs must be closely monitored for evidence of urethral obstruction.",

Besides supportive therapy, information regarding specific treatments is yet very limited in affected cats. Class A CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-A) are short single-stranded DNA molecules containing unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanosine motifs that stimulate production of type I interferons. Studies in cats showed the ability of CpG-A to induce an antiviral state in vivo and to inhibit replication of FPV in vitro. Therefore, aims of this study were to investigate the effects of CpG-A on survival and clinical score, white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC) and platelet counts, as well as viremia and fecal viral shedding in cats naturally infected with FPV. Cats with positive fecal parvovirus antigen test were prospectively enrolled if presenting clinical or laboratory sings of FPV, had body weight >500 g, were unvaccinated and not previously treated. Cats were randomly allocated to receive 100 \u00b5g/kg of CpG-A or placebo subcutaneously, at admission and after 48 h; all cases were treated with supportive therapy. A clinical score derived from attitude, appetite, vomiting, diarrhea and temperature was assigned daily until death or during 7 days. Blood and fecal samples were collected at admission and at 1, 2, 7 days; complete blood counts were obtained and real-time PCR was performed to quantify FPV DNA in blood and fecal samples. Chi-square test and mixed ANOVA were used to compare treatment groups. Forty-two cats were included: 22 received CpG-A and 20 placebo. Survival rate did not differ between cats treated with CpG-A and placebo [11 of 22 (50%) vs. 8 of 20 (40%), respectively; P = 0.516]. Differences between groups were not observed for clinical score, RBC, platelets, viremia and fecal viral shedding at any time point. Mean WBC count was higher in cats treated with CpG-A than with placebo at 7 days (25,800 AE 13,800/\u00b5L vs. 14,900 AE 8400/\u00b5L, respectively; P = 0.017) but not at the other time points. All cats showed discomfort during CpG-A injections. In conclusion, treatment with CpG-A did not improve survival or clinical score and did not reduce viral shedding, suggesting that the drug or the treatment regimen used in this study is not beneficial in cats affected with FPV. The lack of favorable response to CpG-A might be due to the delayed improvement of WBC counts. Of note, the administration of CpG-A may be painful in cats.",

Blood cultures are the gold standard for diagnosis of bacteremia, but are infrequently obtained due to technical and practical difficulties in sample acquisition. In ill patients, urine cultures are sometimes recommended as surrogates for blood cultures as part of a \"better than nothing\" approach. This study evaluated the ability of urine culture to predict blood-stream infection. We retrospectively evaluated all blood, aerobic, and anaerobic cultures submitted at NC State Veterinary Hospital between 2011 and 2016. We calculated growth rates of 18% (blood), 24% (urine), and 61% (non-urine) from 511 blood, 6797 urine, and 6552 non-urine cultures submitted. Blood isolates were most commonly coagulase-positive Staphylococcus spp (27%) and Escherichia coli (14%); Escherichia coli was the most common urinary isolate (43%), along with Enterococcus (14%) and coagulase-positive Staphylococcus (11%). 324 urine and blood samples were submitted in parallel, of which 21 yielded simultaneous growth. Of these, only 14 samples were concordant, while 7 yielded discordant urinary and bloodstream infections. Overall, urinary isolates were poorly reflective of bloodstream isolates, with a sensitivity of 24% but a specificity of 87%. General concordance, including true positive (n = 14) and true negatives (n = 232), between urinary and bloodstream isolates was 76%. Urine culture isolates had a poor positive predictive value (29%) but a negative predictive value of 84% for bloodstream infection. An apparent exception is patients with suspected urogenital infection sources (renal, prostatic, etc), in which 100% (n = 7) had concordant urinary and bloodstream infections. Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus infections were most likely to be concordant. 133 non-urine samples submitted in parallel with blood cultures were also evaluated; only biliary and intravenous catheter samples carried a PPV >40%. In short, we recommend that if bloodstream infection is suspected, blood cultures be acquired.",

A clinical validation included 273 samples collected from 214 cats. 201 samples were collected from 195 exposed cats without lesions; 72 samples were collected from 19 cats with confirmed dermatophytosis lesions. Culture was positive in 17 lesion samples from 7 dermatophytosis confirmed cats. PCR was positive in 15 of those samples, as well as in an additional 7 positive lesion samples from a total of 8 cats. Culture was 87% sensitive and 88% specific when compared to PCR on lesioned samples. Cats without lesions but exposed to diseased cats were also tested to determine if PCR is too sensitive by detecting fomite carriers. PCR detected 7 positive samples from 4 exposed cats; compared to 10 culture positives from 10 exposed cats. Of the 19 cats with lesions, 6 were monitored at regular intervals during systemic and topical therapy. The average time to resolution was 47 days. The shortest duration to resolution was 23 days. It is therefore recommended that PCR monitoring should start at around 3 weeks of treatment. In summary, qPCR compared to conventional culture showed excellent sensitivity in clinical cases with lesions, did not pick up significant false positive signals in cats exposed to but not infected with Dermatophytes and can be used to monitor therapy success. Paired with its speed to result, the qPCR panel has excellent utility in the diagnosis of Dermatophytosis.",

Hepatocyte expression of p21, a universal cell-cycle inhibitor and marker of cellular senescence, is strongly negatively correlated with outcome in humans with alcoholic and non-alcoholic related liver disease and is a better prognostic marker than histological or clinical scoring systems. P21 expression has not been investigated in CCH. This study investigated whether hepatocyte p21 expression is increased in CCH and if expression is associated with survival. Cases of CCH were retrieved from the pathology database (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) and liver biopsy samples were reviewed using routine stains (hematoxylin & eosin, rhodanine, and Sirius red).

Clinical signs are non-specific, and most available serum tests, including serum amylase and lipase activities and feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity (fTLI) lack specificity and/or sensitivity in this species. Serum specific feline pancreatic lipase (Spec fPL) is currently the most useful serum test for pancreatitis in cats. Based on this test, a rapid, in-clinic, semi-quantitative test for the estimation of fPL (SNAP fPL TM ) in serum has been developed. Currently, no studies have evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of this tool for pancreatitis in cats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the specificity of SNAP fPL in two groups of cats: a) healthy cats and b) sick cats without clinical suspicion of pancreatitis. A total of 196 cats were included in the study. Of them, 105 were clinically healthy (based on history and physical examination) and 91 cats were sick. The group of sick cats consisted of cats with a wide variety of diseases, for which pancreatitis was not considered a major differential or for which a final diagnosis other than pancreatitis that would explain the clinical signs was available. Whole blood was collected from all cats, and serum was separated and stored until analysis. The SNAP fPL test was performed and interpreted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specificity was calculated for each group of cats separately and for both groups combined.",

CP in ECSs shows remarkable clinical similarities to human IgG4-RD with a high prevalence of KCS, xerostomia, proteinuria and other immune-mediated diseases. Affected dogs can present with benign mass-like pancreatic lesions. The disease appears to be more common in blue roan dogs.",

In cats, hypoalbuminemia in CE is considered infrequent, but specific investigations about protein profile in these patients have been not published . The aim of this study was to evaluate serum protein profiling in cats with IBD and lymphoma, and to compare it with clinical symptoms, endoscopic assessments and histopathological diagnoses. FCEAI clinical index score, CBC, serum biochemical profile and urinalysis were evaluated in 100 cats affected by IBD and lymphoma. Endoscopy of upper and lower gastrointestinal tract was performed and a severity score from 0 to 3 was assigned based on WSAVA guidelines. Histopathological diagnosis was based on WSAVA guidelines. Total serum protein, serum protein agarose gel electrophoresis, and albumin-globulin ratio (A/G) were evaluated at time of diagnosis. Cats ranged from 1 to 17 years old (10 median), 46% were females and 93% were European shorthair. The histologic diagnosis was IBD (66%) and lymphoma (34%). The most common symptoms were vomiting (70%), weight loss (67%) and diarrhea (37%). Mean FCEAI score was 9.4 AE 2.59. Mean serum total protein was 6.01 AE 0.99 g/dL. Low total protein (5.04 AE 0.63 g/dL) occurred in 41% of cats and only 10% had hypoalbuminemia. Beta globulins were decreased in 70% of cats, and gamma globulins were increased in 75%. A/G ratio was significantly higher in cats with hypoproteinemia (1.1 AE 0.3) compared to non-hypoproteinemic cats (0.9 AE 0.1). No statistical differences between protein profile and symptoms, FCEAI, gastrointestinal tract concerned, endoscopic score, type and severity of histologic pattern were found. Despite the hypoproteinemia was a relatively frequent finding in this work, a correlation with the clinical variables was not established. In addition, the clinical severity, the endoscopic and histological grading was not related to protein profile. Dysproteinemia with low beta globulin and high gamma globulin were the most common alterations. In hypoproteinemic cats A/G was higher than in non-hypoproteinemic cats. The decrease of beta globulin could be due to malnutrition but also to iron metabolism modifications occurring in chronic inflammatory disease, with reduction of transferrin and ferritin. Hypergammaglobulinemia is reported in human medicine as a common feature of IBD associated to extraintestinal manifestation.

This fact is especially important in order to identify B2 patients -ACVIM classification-that can benefit from starting medication or to prevent congestive heart failure. The vena contracta is the narrowest portion of a jet downstream from the regurgitant orifice. The objective of the present study is to prove if the vena contracta could be used as criteria for classification in dogs with DCMVD. One hundred and thirteen dogs suffering from DCMVD in different phases according to ACVIM classification, have been included: B1, n = 54; B2, n = 51 and C, n = 8. The vena contracta was measured from the parasternal left apical four-chamber long axis view. Three measurements were obtained for each dog and the average was obtained. The results showed a statistically significant difference between stages for enddiastolic left ventricular index (EDVI), end-systolic left ventricular index (ESVI) and vena contracta (Kruskal-Wallis for independent samples test). The differences were significant between B1 dogs and B2 dogs (P = 0.022) and between B1 and C dogs (P = 0.035) for vena contracta. The differences were significant between B1 dogs and B2 dogs (P < 0.0001) and between B1 and C dogs (P < 0.001) for EDVI. The differences were significant between B1 dogs and B2 dogs (P = 0.044) and between B1 and C dogs (P = 0.032) for ESVI. There were no differences for these values between B2 and C dogs. The vena contracta appears to be useful to differentiate between early phases of DCMVD and congestive phase of DCMVD but it seems less useful to differentiate between B2 dogs and C dogs. It is important to remember that this measurement is not useful if multiple jets are present, which is common in dogs with DCMVD. The vena contracta has an ellipsoidal shape so the measurements could vary depending on the plane of acquisition. Due to the fact that the vena contracta usually is small (typically less than 0.5 cm), slight measurement errors could lead to large mistakes and misclassifications. In human, it is recommended to measure the vena contracta from the right parasternal long axis. All of these factors must be taken into consideration from a critical point of view in the face of the present results.",

This study addresses the general hypothesis that PH secondary to L-CHF is uncommon in cats and that echocardiographic findings in cats with PH are different compared to dogs. This retrospective observational study included 56 healthy cats and 131 cats with L-CHF imaged between 2004 and 2016 at the Ohio State University, Veterinary Medical Center.

Dachshunds are predisposed to develop mitral valve prolapse (MVP) which is a systolic displacement of one or both mitral leaflets beyond the mitral valve annulus. The MVP is associated with marked sinus arrhythmia in Dachshund. The hypothesis is that adult healthy Dachshund dogs are predisposed to exhibit MVP before mitral regurgitation.

It is a sound produced by blood flow, usually detected in puppies, but can be commonly observed in healthy young adult dogs. PHM may be a result of an increased sympathetic tone, and is possible to be secondary to anxiety. It has been described in some breeds and in athletic dogs during adulthood. A cross-sectional study was performed with 69 healthy Dachshunds, including 28 males (40.6%) and 41 females (59.4%), aging between 18 months to 10 years-old and weighting 8.4 AE 2.3 kg. The dogs underwent through physical examination, blood testing, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, blood pressure measurement and thoracic radiography. No abnormalities were found. Systolic heart murmurs were detected in 36 dogs (52.2%): 32 (46.4%) with grade II/VI and 4 (5.8%) with grade III/VI (Levine/Freeman Scale). Murmurs were mostly located in mitral valve area (72.2%). Heart murmurs in adult dogs are frequently indicative of pathological conditions. However, none of the 36 dogs had structural heart abnormalities or systemic disturbances. Therefore, this study shows a high prevalence of PHM in healthy adult Dachshunds. Disclosures: No disclosures to report. Research of new biomarkers in body fluids to detect the primary problem is crucial in human and veterinary medicine. Although serum choline is suggested as emerging biomarkers in human and dogs with myocardial ischemia, there is no available data on usefulness of choline levels for predicting cardiac events. Therefore, this study was aimed to evaluate the use of choline concentration as a potential biomarker for distinguishing pleural effusions due to heart base tumors (HBT) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and determine whether there was a correlation between pleural and serum choline levels in dogs. Dogs with pleural effusion due to DCM (n = 11) and HBT (n = 8) were used as materials. Pleural effusions were diagnosed by clinical, radiological and ultrasonographic (US) examinations along with US-guided thoracentesis. DCM was diagnosed based on the sum of the scores (\u22656 points) recommended by European Society of Veterinary Cardiology taskforce. Pre-operative diagnosis of HBTs was confirmed by histopathological evaluations showing mesothelioma, chemodectoma, hemangiosarcoma, and aortic body tumors. Healthy age-and breed-matched dogs (n = 10) were used as controls. Serum free-choline concentration of each sample was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography in triplicate and results were expressed as micromolar (lM).",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of enriching food with bioactive ingredients, including EPA and DHA, on body composition, and concentrations of circulating fatty acids and the inflammatory biomarker prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ). Domestic short hair cats (n = 81; mean age 11.1 years, range 6 to 14 years) were fed a pretrial food for 30 days, randomized into three groups, and then fed one of three diets for 180 days. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc. The pretrial food contained 33.4% protein, 0.12% arachidonic acid (AA) and negligible EPA and DHA. The control food contained 32.6% protein, 0.10% AA, 0.03% EPA, and 0.02% DHA. Test food 1 (TF1) and Test food 2 (TF2) contained 31.8% and 30.2% protein, respectively, as well as 0.04% AA, 0.095% EPA, and 0.06% DHA. Both TF1 and TF2 contained additional bioactive food factors (from broccoli, tomatoes, oats, and peas), with TF2 having increased bioactive ingredient concentrations compared with TF1. Serum was analyzed for FA and PGE 2 concentrations initially, and at 45, 90 and 180 days. Concurrently, body composition was determined by dual energy xray absorptiometry. After consuming food for 180 days, lean body mass (LBM) was unchanged in cats fed control food (42 AE 30 g), whereas cats fed TF1 (73 AE 30 g; P = 0.02) and TF2 (197 AE 31 g; P < 0.01) had increased LBM. Body fat was unchanged in cats fed control food (\u00c011 AE 43 g), but decreased in cats fed TF1 (\u00c0124 AE 42 g; P < 0.01) and TF2 (\u00c0185 AE 43 g; P < 0.01). PGE 2 concentrations were decreased in cats fed control and TFs, and were positively correlated to the ratio of (n-6) to (n-3) FA in serum (r = 0.31; P < 0.01) and negatively correlated to the sum of (n-3) FA (r = ?0.30; P < 0.001). Cats consuming foods containing plant bioactives and fish oil had reduced concentrations of the inflammatory biomarker PGE 2 and enhanced lean body composition, which together may aid in offsetting inflammation and adiposity associated with aging in cats.",

The correlation coefficient between the BLs-b and IBW in 5 long bodied dogs (Miniature Dachshund, Welsh Corgi, etc.) was higher than it in the all subject dogs. This suggests that it is better to divide dogs into following three types: standard shape, long and square bodied dogs for the morphometric BCS assessment. In addition, individual BCS can be calculated from an estrangement percentage between IBW and current weight by using above formula. This morphometric method is simpler and more objective than the conventional method.",

The 9-point system is preferred but, since visual characteristics are depicted with only 5 silhouette images from a single breed, assessment of visual characteristics of dogs of different size and body shape is challenging. Two modifications to the original 9-point BCS system were developed with reference to an image archive of almost 3799 photographs from 155 dogs attending the Royal Canin Weight Management Clinic, University of Liverpool (Gant. BMC Veterinary Research 2016, 12:18). Body fat mass (measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA]) and BCS was known for all dogs, and owners gave written permission for use of these photographs (VREC50). The first modification was a paper-based system that used a set of 5 size-specific BCS charts, for small, medium, large, and giant breeds, respectively. The written descriptions for each category were identical, but different images were included for the different size categories. The second was a computer-based system whereby visual characteristics were modeled on-screen by altering body shape in 5 different zones (chest, abdomen, back, thigh, and pelvis), with the computer software then calculating the body condition score automatically using an algorithm.",

Renal sodium glucose transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a novel class of drug developed for the management of type-2 diabetes (T2DM) in humans. Inhibition of SGLT2 induces profound renal glucosuria reducing blood glucose and lowering insulin requirements in man. Adverse effects are uncommon. These drugs have not been evaluated in cats to the authors' knowledge. In this study 3 healthy cats were sequentially dosed with 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg of dapagliflozin for 5 days per treatment with a 2 week washout between each regimen. Cats were housed in individual cages. Hematology, serum biochemistry and urinalysis were performed before and after each trial. Daily food, water intake, urine production and 24 h urinary glucose excretion were measured for the duration of each trial. Data was analyzed using a mixed linear model with a fixed effect of 'dose' and 'day', and the random effect of 'cat'. Dapagliflozin induced significant glucosuria at all doses used, which persisted for 5 days after the last dose for each regimen. The 10 mg dose induced the most significant increase in daily urine glucose output with a concomitant decrease in daily urine output. One cat developed a mild hyperglobulinemia and leukocytosis, but no other adverse effects were noted. The cats lost weight during each of the trials, which is one of the touted benefits of the drug in human diabetics. Polydipsia/polyuria were not observed, nor were urinary tract infections detected during the trial. In conclusion, dapagliflozin appeared safe and is effective in inducing glucosuria.",

Feeding of biologically appropriate raw food (BARF) including gullet is popular: Due to the close anatomical position of the thyroid gland and the respective muscle tissue such diets are likely to be contaminated with thyroid gland tissue and may cause alimentary thyrotoxicosis. However, as controlled studies are missing, it is unclear which effect the absorbed total thyroxine (T 4 ) and triiodothyronine (T 3 ) may have on the thyroid hormone status. Because T 4 levels are still routinely checked in the elderly dog and commonly in dogs suspicious of behavioral issues it would be of high diagnostic interest, if potential thyroid gland feeding may interfere with the diagnostic approach. Therefore, the present study aimed in investigating the short term effect of thyroid gland feeding on the thyroid hormone concentration in dogs. Bovine thyroid gland from the slaughterhouse (0.5 g/kg body weight) was fed after 12 h fasting together with a complete dry diet. Blood samples were taken 19 days before the experiment in order to verify euthyroidism in the healthy beagle dogs (n = 5). On the day of the feeding experiment blood was taken before (0 and 4, 8, 24, 52 h as well as 6 days after feeding. In the samples T 4 -, free T 4 -, T 3 and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) as well as thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAA) were measured either using an automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (Immulite\u00d2 1000 System, Siemens Diagnostics, USA) or a commercially available TgAA assay (Oxford Laboratories, MI, USA).. No dog had TgAA. After feeding thyroid gland there was an increase up to 7.8 fold basal levels of T 4 , free T 4 and T 3 serum concentrations. Serum levels returned to basal levels after 52 h, however, three of five dogs showed T 4 and fT 4 concentrations below the reference range 52 h and 6 days after single controlled thyroid gland feeding. TSH levels were suppressed after feeding for 52 h. None of the dogs showed any clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Feeding of thyroid tissue to healthy dogs resulted in distinct effects on the thyroid hormone blood concentration. Initially single feeding of thyroid gland lead to considerably higher T 4 levels but afterwards also to lower T 4 and fT 4 concentrations. Therefore, if euthyroidism should be diagnosed, administration of dog food containing thyroid gland should be carefully ruled out for the last seven days. Disclosures: No disclosures to report. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a major acute phase protein and a marker of systemic inflammation in dogs. C-reactive protein, and indirectly the innate immune system, has not previously been evaluated in dogs with Hypoadrenocorticism (HA). Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate if dogs with HA were able to mount an acute phase response assessed by an elevated CRP. Medical records were reviewed for patients newly diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism between May 2010 to March 2017. Dogs were considered having HA if both a pre-and post ACTH stimulation cortisol were \u226455 nmol/L. Dogs were excluded if they were not newly diagnosed with HA, or had received treatment for either hypoadrenocorticism or hyperadrenocorticism, or if they did not have a CRP measured around the time of diagnosis.",

Canine hypothyroidism is associated with decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), while serum creatinine (SCr) concentrations are rarely increased above the reference interval (RI) in hypothyroid dogs. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is considered a biomarker for early detection of renal dysfunction and resulted strongly correlated with GFR in dogs. In humans, SDMA is significantly higher in hypothyroid compared to healthy people. The aim of this study was to evaluate the SDMA concentrations in a population of hypothyroid dogs (HD) at the time of diagnosis (T0) and after treatment (T1). Fourteen dogs affected by spontaneous hypothyroidism and 20 healthy dogs (control group) were included. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism was based on consistent clinical signs, laboratory findings, including serum total T4 and cTSH concentrations below and above the RI, respectively. In dogs with normal cTSH, rhTSH stimulation test was performed to confirm the diagnosis. SCr was measured for diagnostic or checkup purposes and SDMA was measured afterwards from surplus of serum stored at \u00c020\u00b0C. In HD such measurements where performed at T0 after 15 to 112 days (median 64.5) of treatment (T1) with levothyroxine (10-15 \u00b5g/kg q12 h PO). SDMA was measured using a validated immunoassay (IDEXX SDMA test).HD had a median age of 4 years (4-15), median body weight (BW) of 37.5 kg (7.9-53), 7/14 were male (1 castrated) and 7/14 female (3 spayed). There were no significant differences regarding signalment and BW between HD and control group. Median SDMA concentrations (RI <14 \u00b5g/dL) were 10 \u00b5g/dL (6-17), 13.5 \u00b5g/dL (7-20) and 10.5 \u00b5g/ dL (5-17) in healthy dogs, HD at T0 and T1, respectively.

Body condition score (BCS, 5-point system) was also assessed. Each cat was gently restrained for radiographic examination without sedation. Radiographs of both shoulders, elbows, carpi, coxofemoral joints, stifles, and tarsi were evaluated. Among 116 cats, 111 (95.7%) cats had at least one appendicular joint affected with radiographic osteoarthritis. The prevalence of DJD in shoulders, elbows, carpi, coxofemoral joints, stifles, and tarsi were 15/116 (12.9%), 86/116 (74.1%), 82/116 (70.7%), 17/116 (14.7%), 71/116 (61.2%), and 11/ 116 (9.5%), respectively.

All owners of cats whose cases were included in this study signed up their written consent for agreement of participating in a research study. Carica papaya leaf extracts have been used orally to recover platelet counts and to control bleeding in human patients with Dengue fever. The active components of papaya carica extract have been proved earlier to inhibit immune mediated platelet destruction and possible bone marrow suppression to fasten the natural course of recovery by increasing the platelet counts. In this report we studied the effect of Caprica papaya in the treatment of infectious thrombocytopenia in dogs. During a one-year period 60 thrombocytopenic dogs with ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and/or leptospirosis referred to Madras Veterinary College Teaching Hospital were studied. They had mild (platelets 50,000-100,000/\u00b5l) to severe (platelets 25,000-50,000/\u00b5l) thrombocytopenia and evidence of bleeding. In addition coagulation profiles, buccal mucosal bleeding times, saline agglutination tests, spherocyte reviews, direct Coombs' (Direct Antiglobulin) tests, von Willebrand Factor assays, platelet-associated antibody (PSAb) assays, bone marrow aspiration cytology, and DEA 1 typings were determined. Plateletrich plasma or fresh whole blood were transfused in case of severe (platelets <20,000 cells/\u00b5L) thrombocytopenia and/or anemia and all dogs received doxycycline and prednisone for ehrlichiosis and leptospirosis, Imidocarb for babesiosis,. Carica papaya leaf extract was administered at 5 mL per 10 kg body weight twice a day for 3 weeks. Platelet counts increased significantly faster in dogs receiving Carica papaya from day 2-7 compared to those receiving only other treatments. Also the bleeding signs appear to improve more rapidly with Carica papaya, and no side effects were observed. In conclusion Carica papaya may be an inexpensive, easily available thrombopoietic supplement to more rapidly control thrombocytopenia and bleeding in dogs with hemoprotozoan diseases along with transfusions, specific infectious disease and immunosuppression.",

The Pug breed is predisposed for specific orthopedic conditions and neuromuscular problems in the Pug breed has become increasingly recognized in the last few years. Lameness, as the result of musculoskeletal problems, and spinal cord disorders, characterized by paresis and ataxia, were reported in a British study in 2.4% versus 1.4% of the Pugs attending primary veterinary care. The prevalence of spinal cord disorders presented from the United Kingdom poorly corresponds to a Swedish insurance data report suggesting a seven-fold increase in mortality rate for ataxia, paresis and collapse in Pugs compared to other breeds. Adding the attention 'wobbly Pugs' are given on the internet suggests a need to investigate the prevalence of gait abnormalities in the Pug in a systematic way. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the prevalence of gait abnormalities in a cohort of Swedish Pugs by using an owner-based questionnaire targeting signs of gait abnormality and video footage showing the dog\u00b4s gait. The study also aimed at evaluating associated conditions of abnormal gait; including other health disorders prevalent in the breed. The owners reported gait aberrations in 20.2 % of the Pugs with a prevalence increase with increasing age. Adding the Pugs that were reported to show indirect signs of gait abnormalities (wearing their nails and dorsal aspect of the skin on their paws) increased the prevalence of gait abnormalities in the breed from 20.2% to 30.7%. These results suggest gait abnormalities to be a more significant health problem than previously reported. Indeed, the single, listed, most common cause for death/euthanasia, reported by the owners, was a gait abnormality. In conclusion, gait abnormalities were a common finding in the Pug breed. Wearing of the nails and/or skin on the dorsum of the paws, predominately in the thoracic limbs, were frequently found and from a comparably young age. The result of the questionnaire and the video analysis suggest neurological disorders are predominately responsible for the high prevalence of gait abnormalities in the Pug breed. The prevalence of abnormal gait was significantly associated with age and with dyspnea. The gait abnormalities were not associated with overt signs of pain but were associated with reluctance to go for walks. Disclosures: No disclosures to report. The development of bronchiectasis (BE), an irreversible dilation of the bronchi, is a well-established complication after bacterial or viral pneumonia in humans. BE leads to defects in the mucociliary clearance and predisposes to the development of new bacterial respiratory infections. BE has been described in dogs with variety of respiratory diseases, but the connection to recurrent bacterial infections has not been fully established. A breed predisposition to acute bacterial pneumonia (BP) has been described in the Irish wolfhound (IWH), but the etiology is largely undiscovered. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed to 10 IWHs with recurrent BP (median age 6.0 years, range 0.8-7.7 years; median number of previous BPs 4, range 2-6). All dogs were examined when they were clinically healthy and not receiving antibiotics. HRCT findings comprised mild to severe bronchiectasis (9/10 dogs), mild to moderate local bronchointerstitial pattern (2/10), mild local interstitial pattern (1/10), parenchymal band (1/ 10), locally thickened pleura 1/10 and subpleural band (1/10). Bronchiectasis was detected in a single lung lobe in 3/9, in 2 lung lobes in 3/9 and in 3 lung lobes in 3/9 dogs. Left and right cranial lobes and the right middle lobe were most often involved.",

Sinonasal aspergillosis (SNA) most commonly affects middle-aged dolichocephalic dogs and is characterized by a destructive rhinitis and sinusitis, in the absence of fungal deeper tissue invasion. Pathogenesis of the disease is, to date, not fully understood. An uncontrolled and detrimental inflammatory response to commensal fungal colonization of the nasal cavities and sinuses has been suggested. In humans, a role of the bacterial microbiota in the regulation of host immune responsiveness to fungi has been hypothesized. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to identify and characterize the microbiota present in nasal cavities of client-owned dogs diagnosed with SNA compared with healthy age and breed-matched non-affected dogs. Nine large breed dolichocephalic dogs diagnosed with SNA (6 males, 3 females, mean age 5.5 years) and 10 healthy age-and breed-matched dogs (7 males, 3 females, mean age 5 years) were included. DNA was extracted from a sterile swab introduced in the distal third of the right nasal cavity under general anesthesia. Metagenetic analysis was performed on V1-V3 hypervariable region of 16S rDNA after total bacterial DNA extraction from nasal specimens and sequencing on a MiSeq Illumina sequencer. Taxonomical assignation and microbiota community analysis were done with MOTHUR V1.35 with an OTU clustering distance of 0.03. Differences of population abundance between groups were assessed using multiple t tests with Holm-Sidak multi-test correction (significance < 0.05).",

Ultrasound guided renal biopsy is an essential diagnostics method which, by facilitating histopathological examination can increase the accuracy of the differential diagnosis between acute and chronic nephropathies and will help the clinician perform an etiologic diagnosis, issue a prognosis and orient the therapy of the majority of parenchymal nephropathies. Due to the relative invasiveness and potential adverse effects, the use of renal biopsy is limited among practitioners. In this study we evaluate the intensity of renal damage induced by renal cortex sampling and the clinical consequences of such a procedure. We examined 28 dogs, mixed breed and variable ages, 11 (39, 29 %) males and 17 (60, 71 %) females that were referred to our clinic and underwent ultrasound guided renal biopsy in order to establish a definite diagnosis. Patients were presented with a variety of diffuse nephropathies: kidney lymphoma: 1 (3.57%), glomerulonephritis: 13 (46.43%), tubulointerstitial nephritis: 11 (39.29 %) and nephrocalcinosis: 3 (10.71%) of which 18 (64.29 %) were in acute kidney failure and 10 (35.71 %) were chronic renal patients. The type and the severity of renal lesions were correlated with changes in urinary NAG index (iNAG), and specific serum renal damage markers such as urea, creatinine, phosphorus and ionized calcium. To quantify the side effects of percutaneous renal biopsy the magnitude of post biopsy hematuria and changes in urinary iNAG activity were evaluated. The results indicate a significant post biopsy increase in urinary iNAG activity in all patients that underwent this procedure (100.08 AE 34.45 (U/g) pre-biopsy iNAG vs. 147.65 AE 33.26 (U/g) post-biopsy iNAG, P < 0.001) suggesting an intensification in renal tubular damage consecutive to kidney puncture and sampling. Transitory macro-or microhematuria were constant findings in all dogs that underwent ultrasound guided renal biopsy but the magnitude and extent could not be associated with PLT(10 9 /L), aPTT (s) and PT (s) levels in our patients, and resolved after 12-24 h without therapeutical interventions.",

Five dogs received palliative treatment (antibiotics, corticoids) (control group or CG) and the other 5 dogs were treated with a combination of firocoxib, flutamide and toceranib (treatment group or TG). One dog of the TG refused treatment with toceranib due to economy matters. Survival time was defined as the time from IMC diagnosis to euthanasia or death of the dog. Age at the time of IMC diagnosis, reproductive status, previous history of mammary tumors and evolution of IMC after treatment were also analyzed.

Previous studies have demonstrated Leishmania infantum infection in colonic samples with histiocytic or lymphoplasmacytic inflammation from seropositive sick dogs. However, there are no studies that have investigated the presence of L. infantum infection in dogs diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by clinical and histopathological examination. The objectives of this study were to retrospectively investigate the presence of Leishmania infection by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in archived canine colonic biopsies previously diagnosed with IBD in an area endemic for canine leishmaniosis as well as to describe the main histopathological findings. A total of 109 cases of canine colitis were retrospectively retrieved from the archived of biopsies of Servei de Diagn ostic de Patologia of the Universitat Aut onoma de Barcelona. Information regarding clinicopathological data including signalment, histological results and further diagnostic testing to detect Leishmania infection such as Leishmania IHC staining was compiled from the selected cases. Lymphoplasmacytic (n = 101), histiocytic (n = 5), and lymphoplasmacytic with mild eosinophilic/neutrophilic component (n = 3) colitis were diagnosed between January 1997 and September 2015 performed by endoscopic colonic biopsies. Interestingly, Leishmania IHC was only carried out in 13 out of 109 (11.9 %) colonic samples to confirm or exclude Leishmania infection based on the diagnostic database. From those, 5 were diagnosed as granulomatous and 8 as lymphoplasmacytic colitis. Four biopsies were classified as positive, two as unclear results due to unspecific background staining and the rest were negative for Leishmania IHC. Leishmania IHC was performed in 56 out of the remaining 96 colonic samples with a diagnosis of lymphoplasmocytic or histiocytic inflammation that were not previously tested to confirm or exclude this infection. Due to economical restrictions, only 56 colonic samples retrieved could be investigated. Only one out of 56 (1.8%) colonic biopsies examined was classified as positive by IHC. A total of 5 out of 109 (4.6%) dogs were diagnosed with Leishmania infection. Two dogs presented intense histiocytic inflammation while three dogs showed mild to intense lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. The number of amastigotes per 5 microscopic fields viewed at 409 assessed by IHC was variable and ranged between 2 to countless. In conclusion, Leishmania infection should be included in the list of differentials of inflammatory colonic biopsies. Leishmania amastigotes are commonly not visualized by routine histological staining. Therefore, IHC for Leishmania should be routinely used as a diagnostic tool in endemic areas of leishmaniosis, to exclude or confirm an infection by this parasite in patients with a diagnosis of IBD.

It has also been previously shown that this myocardial damage is likely to be primarily associated with the severity of the protozoal disease and not with the degree of azotemia, anemia or systemic arterial hypertension. It remains to be determined however whether this myocardial damage is directly correlated with the cardiac parasitic load or the damage is primarily indirect through other mechanisms such as systemic inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the concentration of cTnI, histopathology severity and plasma creatinine concentration (Cr) with the parasitic load within cardiac tissue samples in a cohort of dogs with CanL.",

Distemper, infectious canine hepatitis and parvovirosis are lifethreatening diseases due respectively to canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus virus (CAV)-1 and canine parvovirus (CPV). The maintenance of the serological response post vaccination is often used to evaluate the protective status of a dog. However, as live vaccines stimulate mainly the cell-mediated pathway of the immune system, this method may underestimate the real duration of efficacy of these vaccines. The study aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the attenuated CDV, CAV and CPV strains of the multivalent Canigen TM DHPPi/L vaccine (Virbac, France) after experimental infections performed at three years after the first annual booster. Forty seven SPF Beagle puppies, males and females, participated in the study. Puppies were allocated to either the vaccinated group (Group 1, n = 23) or the unvaccinated group (Group 2, n = 24). Puppies of Group 1 received Canigen TM DHPPi/L vaccine, formulated at minimum titer for the live components, for primary vaccination with two injections at a three-week interval (respectively at 9 and 12 weeks of age) and for the first annual booster. Blood samples were taken on several occasions for serological follow-up. CDV, CAV-1, CPV-2 and CPV-2c antibody titers were measured by seroneutralization tests (SN).

According to previous studies, B. canis is considered as the main species involved in canine babesiosis, but in recent years more studies show the existence of Babesia gibsoni infected dogs both in Europe and Romania. B. gibsoni infection in dogs is mainly described in American Pit Bull Terriers, although the significance of this breed predisposition is not yet fully understood, however the possibility of both blood-to-blood transfer and transplacental infection has been considered as a possible modality of host contamination. A 3 year old female, American Staffordshire Terrier was referred to our clinic, previously diagnosed with Babesia canis infection and treated with one dose of imidocarb dipropionate three days prior. The dog presented fever, pale mucous membranes and hemoglobinuria. Complete blood count revealed severe anemia (HCT 13%, Hg 4 g/dL, RBC 1.56 9 10 12 / L), thrombocytopenia (PLT 32 9 10 9 /L) and mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia. Coomb's test (Alvedia) and rapid test for Dirofilaria immitis antigen, Ehlichia canis antigen, Borrelia burgdoferi antigen, Anaplasma phogocytophilum/Anaplasma platys antibody (Rapid CaniV-4 Test Kit, Bionote) showed negative results. Giemsa-stained blood films were positive for small (1-2.7 \u00b5m) pleomorphic inclusions. Babesia spp. DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, further molecular characterization of the sample showed the involvement of Babesia gibsoni (Macrogen Europe, Amsterdam). Following molecular identification of Babesia gibsoni, combination therapy was initiated with Clindamycin (25 mg/kg PO BID), Doxycycline (15 mg/kg PO BID), and Metronidazole (5 mg/kg PO BID). Fourteen days after therapy Hb, HCT, RBC and PLT values increased, but the blood sample tested positive for B. gibsoni by PCR. Therapy was ceased after 6 weeks, when HCT reached 40% and PCR showed complete B.gibsoni infection sterilization of the patient. Blood samples tested three and six months after the initiation of the treatment remained negative for B. gibsoni. Since the female was 5 weeks post-partum at the time of babesiosis diagnostic was established, four samples from two different litter pups were tested and found negative for B.gibsoni, although transplancetal transmission is possible in B.gibsoni infection. Accurate diagnosis is important in dogs presenting hemolythic anemia, because B.gibsoni is resistant to traditional anti-babesial therapy, but combination therapies may be efficient in order to reduce and eliminate parasitemia.

Cytauxzoonosis is typically fatal in clinical cases without aggressive treatment. Combination treatment with atovaquone and azithromycin (A&A) along with supportive care has improved survival rates to over 60%; in contrast, survival rates with imidocarb dipropionate are 26%. Parasite resistance to atovaquone via a cytochrome b parasite gene (cytb) mutation has been identified in other protozoans and is a concern for C. felis. Specifically, mutations at the M128 amino acid position of the putative atovaquone binding site on CYTB have been associated with resistance. We aimed to characterize the atovaquone binding region of cytb in samples from a C. felis-infected domestic cat that remained parasitemic despite treatment with atovaquone and azithromycin. An approximately nine-year female spayed domestic shorthair was presented for adoption assessment; the cat was anemic which persisted despite fenbendazole and doxycycline treatment. Comprehensive infectious disease testing detected C. felis via microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Atovaquone (15 mg/kg PO q8 h 9 10 days) and azithromycin (10 mg/kg PO q24 h 9 10 days) treatment were administered and the PCV improved, but the cat remained persistently infected with C. felis. Sequencing of the atovaquone binding region of cytb over the course of infection (pre and post-treatment samples) would reveal a transition from wild-type (M128) to isoleucine and valine (M128I and M128V) at two and four months post treatment. A repeat treatment course with A&A using an increased atovaquone dose (25 mg/kg PO q8 h 9 10 days) would fail to clear the C. felis infection and M128I and M128V mutations persisted. The wild-type M128 cytb was not detected in post-treatment samples up to 210 days. This is the first documentation of resistance of C. felis to atovaquone associated with M128 cytb mutations. Additionally, this carrier cat appears to be the first chronically C. felis-infected felid with persistent anemia. This case suggests that parasites with mutations of cytb M128 can be selected and impart resistance to A&A treatment even in the face of increased atovaquone dosing.",

The cat, a European 6-month-old male, was presented with wide alopecic and erythematous areas on the face and paws. After few days the skin lesions spread to other areas of the body and ulcers appeared on the tongue and palate.

The OPXV strain, Italy-09/17, was isolated on African green monkey kidney CV-1 cells and also on embryonated eggs, as demonstrated by the development of the typical pocks in the chorioallantoic membrane. A large amount of typical brick-shaped virions, approximately 320 9 240 nm in size, morphologically related to the genus Orthopoxvirus, were observed by negative staining electron microscopy. The nearly full-length genome of the virus was obtained through a next-generation sequencing approach carried out on the isolated virus. By sequence and phylogenetic analysis of selected genomic regions, which are commonly used to classify OPXVs, isolate Italy-09/17 was proven to form a separate cluster from both CPXV and ECTV. Extensive epidemiological surveillance in cats and wild animals, including rodents, will assess whether this feline OPXV circulates in domestic cat populations and whether cats are incidental hosts or represent the main reservoir of the virus.",

Moreover, post-prandial values were increased more often than fasting values; therefore, if just one BA can be performed, post-feeding could be the preferred test.",

Blood samples were collected from hunting dogs (n. 1,311) without any specific signs associated to bebesiosis in the Avellino, Napoli, and Salerno provinces of Campania region of southern Italy. Signalment and history of tick infestation was recorded for each dog at the time of blood collection. Serology testing was performed by two enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs), with one designed to detect canine antibodies to B. canis and B. vogeli and the other designed to detect canine antibodies to B. gibsoni. All samples were tested by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for the presence of two large-form Babesias, Babesia canis and Babesia vogeli, and one small-form Babesia, Babesia gibsoni. Nearly half (634/1311, 48.4%) of all hunting dogs had a history of tick infestation. Seropositive rates were 14.0% (184/1311) for B. canis/B. vogeli and 0.2% (3/1311) for B. gibsoni. PCR positives rates for B. canis, and B. vogeli, were 0.2% (2/1311) and 1.1% (15/1311), respectively. No dog tested positive by RT-PCR for B. gibsoni. Salerno had the highest prevalence of Babesia spp. infections with 22.5% of dogs testing positive by either PCR or ELISA followed by Avellino (15.7%) and Napoli (8.6%).

Diagnosis of CVBD is generally supported by hematologic and serologic findings. Commonly used serological tests include immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and/or ELISA. Rapid in-clinic tests are also available. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of rapid tests with gold standard IFA and/or ELISA for detection of canine antibodies to Leishmania infantum, Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma platys. The rapid tests evaluated included SNAP \u00d2 Leishmania and SNAP \u00d2 4Dx \u00d2 Plus (IDEXX), Uranotest Leishmania and Uranotest Ehrlichia-Anaplasma (Uranovet). Study samples were collected from IDEXX Reference Laboratories from samples remaining after requested diagnostic testing was completed. These samples were originally submitted by attending veterinarians for detection of Leishmania antibodies using LEISCAN \u00d2 Leishmania ELISA Test, or for detection of E. canis antibodies using E. canis IFA. Positive samples for Leishmania were defined for this study as those with \u22651/160 equivalent titer (converted from OD ratio per manufacturer's instructions), negatives with \u2264 1/20 equivalent titer. To control for potential cross-reactivity of E. canis IFA, a speciesspecific ELISA (McBride et al. 2007) was used to confirm E. canis samples. Another species-specific ELISA (Qurollo et al. 2014) was used to identify A. platys samples. Compared to the respective diagnostic standards, the sensitivities of SNAP and Uranotest were 90.3% and 67.7% respectively for Leishmania, 96.2% and 65.4% for E. canis, 83.0% and 48.9% for A. platys. Specificities were high for all test kits. This study revealed that the accuracy of in-clinic rapid tests for CVBD varies significantly",

Wood 1 . 1 Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, Canada, 2 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Montreal, ST Hyacinthe, CanadaUp to 60% of the mortality in dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is associated with thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation. No conventional hemostatic test is accurate to evaluate the risk for hypercoagulability. Viscoelastic testing has been proven to be influenced by anemia, and might not reliably assess hemostasis in IMHA patients. Calibrated automated thrombography (CAT) is a thrombin generation (TG) assay that has been validated in clinically healthy dogs. The objective of the study was to assess the suitability of TG in the assessment of hypercoagulability in IMHA patients. IMHA was determined by the presence of anemia, spherocyte and positive slide agglutination test or positive Coomb's Test. CBC, coagulation profile and CAT parameters (lag time, time to peak, peak, endogenous thrombin potential) were performed in all IMHA patients, at the time of diagnosis and then at 48 and 96 h. Lag time was prolonged for IMHA patients at day 0 (D0) and D2; and time to peak was higher on D0 but not statistically different on D2 or D4 compared to healthy dogs. Peak was higher in dogs with IMHA at D0, D2 and D4. There was no statistical difference in the endogenous thrombin potential between IMHA and healthy dogs. No correlation between the CAT parameters and blood cell count, coagulation parameters or the likelihood for the patient to be discharged. Prolonged lag time and time to peak indicate hypocoagulation in IMHA dogs early in the disease onset, however, based on peak value, IMHA patients appear to generate more thrombin once coagulation is initiated compared to normal dogs. TG was not useful in predicting patient outcomes.Disclosures: No disclosures to report.ESVIM -O -2 EFFECT OF IMMUNE-SUPPRESSIVE TREATMENT ON CYTOKINE PRODUCTION IN HEALTHY DOGS. J.R.S.

Rajam\u20ac aki, L. Lilja-Maula. University of Helsinki/Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Helsinki, FinlandIn addition to respiratory difficulties, exercise intolerance and impaired recovery are major signs of brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS). Therefore, we investigated the correlations of the 6 min walk test (6MWT) or the 1000 m walk test results with a veterinary assessment of BOAS severity in a group of prospectively recruited 1-5 years old Pugs (N = 35) and French Bulldogs (FBs) (N = 42). For severity of BOAS, dogs graded as having no or mild signs of BOAS were referred to as the BOASgroup and those having moderate or severe signs as the BOAS+ group based on veterinary physical examination findings. The BOAS-Pugs walked longer distance (P = 0.002) in 6MWT (mean 584 AE 33 m, range 505-630) and shorter time (P = 0.006) in 1000 m walk test (mean 10.17 AE 0.67 min, range 9.39-11.94) than BOAS+ Pugs (6MWT 517 AE 64 m, range 400-585; 1000 m test 12.26 AE 2.23 min, range 10.25-17.55). Similarly, the BOAS-FBs walked longer distance (P = 0.063) in 6MWT (639 AE 51 m, range 575-745) and shorter time (P = 0.012) in 1000 m test (9.47 AE 0.66 min, range 8.15-10.77), than BOAS+ FBs (6MWT 593 AE 73 m, range 435-695; 1000 m test 10.72AE 1.25 min,). BOAS-Pugs and FBs recovered also more quickly than BOAS+ Pugs and FBs (P = 0.002; P = 0.007). In conclusion, submaximal exercise test could be used as non-invasive tool for evaluation of severity of BOAS.Disclosures: No disclosures to report.ESVIM-P -7 BRONCHIECTASIS IN IRISH WOLFHOUNDS WITH RECURRENT BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA.

Previous retrospective case series have been small, single center and indicate a grave prognosis. The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective, multicenter review of clinical data relating to dogs and cats diagnosed with dysautonomia and to evaluate the outcome in those patients. Cats and dogs with clinical signs consistent with dysautonomia were included in this retrospective study. A total of 34 cats and 19 dogs were included. Reported clinical signs included esophageal, gastric and intestinal dysmotility and distension, urinary retention and dysuria, reduced or absent tear production, third eyelid protrusion and inappropriate mydriasis. Vomiting and regurgitation were commonly reported in both species (cats n = 29/34, dogs n = 17/19), while signs consistent with urinary retention were primarily reported in dogs (n = 14/19) and third eyelid protrusion was more frequently reported in cats (n = 20/34). Diagnostic imaging findings included aspiration pneumonia, megaesophagus, gastrointestinal dilation with either fluid or gas and bladder distension. Esophageal dilation was the most often identified diagnostic imaging finding in cats (n = 20/34), while in dogs gastrointestinal distension was most commonly identified (n = 5/19). Regularly instituted treatments included gastrointestinal prokinetics such as cisapride and metoclopramide, feeding tube placement (esophageal and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes) and medications to treat urinary retention such as bethanechol. The overall survival to discharge was 36%. The mortality rate prior to discharge was 71% in cats and 53% in dogs. Longer term survival (greater than two years) was seen in three dogs and six cats. In this retrospective study clinical signs, diagnostic imaging findings, treatment and prognosis were all similar to previous retrospective publications. This paper has illustrated that some individuals are able to survive this disease and can have a good long-term prognosis. Prospective studies are required to identify risk factors that indicate whether a patient is likely to survive and thus if it is worth embarking upon treatment.Disclosures: No disclosures to report.ESVIM-P -10 RETROSPECTIVE STUDY ON 33 CASES OF CANINE PRI-MARY IMHA: CLINICO-PATHOLOGICAL FEATURES, FOL-LOW-UP AND PROGNOSTIC FACTORS.

Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the macroscopic endoscopic exam of the bronchial mucosa for the diagnosis of eosinophilic bronchitis. A retrospective multiinstitutional diagnostic accuracy study was performed including all the dogs presenting with acute or chronic coughs and that underwent bronchial endoscopy by the Endovet Italian Group between January 2014 and December 2016. The reference standard was the cytological evaluation of the bronchoalveolar lavage. The primary outcome was sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of endoscopic visualization of nodules for the diagnosis of eosinophilic bronchitis. Of the 845 cases studied, a total of 781 dogs fulfilled the inclusion criteria with cytological evaluation of the bronchoalveolar lavage. The dogs ranged in age from 0.4 to 16 years (8.0 median, 4.0 SD), in body weight from 1.5 to 45 kg (13.0 median, 9.5 SD), and 325 (41.6%) were females. A final diagnosis of eosinophilic bronchitis was given for 113 (15.6%) cases, and 99 (13.6%) presented nodules during macroscopic endoscopy. In the final logistic regression model, detection of nodules during endoscopy, higher age, and lower body weight were associated with a diagnosis of eosinophilic bronchitis. Odds of having eosinophilic bronchitis were 34.4% (18.9-62.6; P < 0.001) greater in dogs presenting nodules during endoscopy. The risk of eosinophilic bronchitis increased by 23% (14-32%; P < 0.001) for a one-year increase in age, and by 3% (0-5%; P = 0.048) for each kilogram decrease in body weight. Visualization of nodules during endoscopy had a sensitivity of 56.6% (47.0-65.9%), specificity of 94.3% (92.3-95.9%), positive predictive value of 62.7% (54.3-70.5%), and negative predictive value of 92.8% (91.2-94.1%). Based on the high specificity and high negative predictive value, visualization of nodules during endoscopy is highly indicative of eosinophilic bronchitis. However, the lack of visualization of nodules during endoscopy does not exclude the presence of eosinophilic bronchitis.Disclosures: No disclosures to report.ESVIM -P -12 REFLUX ASPIRATION CAN BE DETECTED IN LUNGS OF DOGS WITH RESPIRATORY DISEASE.

Therefore, new diagnostic strategies for early detection are needed. Whereas prostate specific antigen (PSA) as a biomarker is controversially discussed for early detection in human medicine, potential biomarkers have not yet been established for dogs. Gene expression data sets, generated by next generation sequencing, offer new possibilities in cancer research for biomarker discovery, understanding of carcinogenesis and development of therapeutic strategies. Since ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsies (US-FNA) of the prostate are routinely used for cytology in dogs, aspirated cells can represent a source for gene expression studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate US-FNA material for routine cytologic diagnosis and leftover cells for molecular biological analysis. US-FNAs were taken prospectively from 16 male dogs after clinical examination. Collected cells were used for cytological examination as well as molecular biological analysis. Prostate tissue samples were taken from 18 euthanized dogs. All samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted from US-FNA samples using the miRNeasy \u00d2 Micro Kit and RNA concentration was measured with Qubit. Prostate tissue samples were classified histopathologically.

University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, CanadaCanine parvovirus is a common cause of severe gastroenteritis in young, incompletely vaccinated dogs. Concurrent infections with gastrointestinal parasites and canine corona virus exacerbate clinical disease, increasing mortality. The ability of bacterial pathogens to potentiate clinical signs has not been thoroughly investigated. Enteropathogenic E. coli, defined by the presence of the eae gene, produce characteristic attaching and effacing lesions on the enterocyte brush border. These E. coli have been identified in up to 36% of dogs with both acute and chronic diarrhea suggesting a pathogenic role. Dogs with severe diarrhea infected with enteropathogenic E. coli have clinical signs and gross pathological lesions that are indistinguishable from parvovirus infection. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of eae positive E. coli in dogs with parvoviral enteritis. Twenty five dogs admitted to the Veterinary Medical Centre in Saskatoon, Canada were included in this study if they met the following criteria: 1. Less than two years of age, 2. Acute onset vomiting and/or diarrhea and 3. Incomplete vaccination history. Feces were cultured and E. coli identified using standard biochemical methods. Isolates were screened for the eae gene by PCR, and amplicon identity was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Feces were evaluated for gastrointestinal parasites by floatation and for giardia and cryptosporidium by immunofluorescent antibody. Complete blood count, serum biochemical profile or venous blood gas, urinalysis and parvovirus fecal ELISA were performed for each dog to identify other potential causes of gastroenteritis. E. coli were cultured from feces of 92% (23/25) of dogs, 8.7% (2/23) were eae positive. All dogs were identified as Parvovirus positive including: 22/25 dogs by fecal ELISA, 1/25 by immunohistochemistry and 2/25 by histopathological examination. Fecal culture identified Clostridium perfringens in 17/24 and Campylobacter in 3/24 dogs. Salmonella were not identified. Concurrent gastrointestinal parasitism was identified in 5/20 dogs tested, identifying Isospora (2/20), Sarcocystis (1/20), and Toxascaris (1/20). Giardia sp. were identified in 2/20 by flotation or IFA. The role of these organisms as canine intestinal pathogens is poorly defined. The low prevalence of eae positive E. coli identified among young dogs with parvovirus suggests that these organisms are unlikely to be significant gut pathogens in patients with parvoviral enteritis. Further study is required to define the role of these potential pathogens in canine enteric disease.Disclosures: No disclosures to report.ISCAID -P -19 COMBINED THERAPY WITH CLINDAMYCIN, DOXYCY-CLINE AND METRONIDAZOLE INDUCES COMPLETE STERILIZATION OF BABESIA GIBSONI INFECTION IN DOGS -A CASE REPORT.

Consequently, feral cats can act as both a reservoir for possible zoonotic diseases as well as a sentinel species for seroprevalence in other animal populations. We assessed the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with exposure to Leptospira, Toxoplasma and Dirofilaria in a population of feral cats from the American Midwest. Serum samples from a total of 140 cats were available for testing. Twelve cats (8.6%) were seropositive for leptospirosis based on a microscopic agglutination test titer of 1:100 or greater. Bratislava was the most commonly reported serovar, accounting for 6/12 positive titers. Forty-two cats (30%) were seropositive for Toxoplasma based on competitive ELISA testing and nine cats (5.3%) were seropositive for Dirofilaria antibodies based on a lateral flow immunoassay. All of the cats for which a Dirofilaria antigen test was performed were negative. Body weight and sexual status was not significantly correlated with seropositivity to any of the studied pathogens. Seropositivity to one pathogen was not found to be a risk factor for seropositivity to other pathogens. Seroprevalence for leptospirosis was significantly greater in spring than in fall (P = 0.023) and varied significantly between age groups (P = 0.014). Similarly, seroprevalence for Toxoplasma varied according to age with cats between 73 and 120 months of age being significantly overrepresented (P = 0.013). Compared to previous seroprevalence reports of feline feral populations from the United States and abroad, this population of cats from the American Midwest had a slightly lower seroprevalence of Toxoplasma but higher seroprevalence of leptospirosis.Disclosures: No disclosures to report. Canine parvovirus (CPV)-2 has been isolated from cats presenting with signs of panleukopenia. CPV-2c is reported as the most pathogenic genetic variant in this specie. Few efficacy data support the ability of current feline parvovirus containing vaccines to protect cats against parvovirus from canine origin. As canine and feline parvovirus seroneutralizing antibodies correlate with clinical protection in each respective specie, the study objective was to demonstrate the ability of both Leucofeligen TM FeLV/RCP and Feligen TM CPR vaccines (Virbac, Carros, France) to protect cats against parvovirosis due to CPV variants by serology.In this retrospective study, kitten sera samples obtained within the frame of two studies were used. In study A, sera were obtained from 18 kittens, 9/18 vaccinated with Leucofeligen TM FeLV/RCP and 9/18 unvaccinated kittens. From study B, sera were from twenty-six kittens, vaccinated with either Feligen TM CRP (11/26) or Leucofeligen TM FeLV/RCP (15/26). All vaccinated kittens had received two sub-cutaneous vaccine injections three weeks apart for primary vaccination, starting at 9-10 weeks of age. Sera were taken prior vaccination and four weeks after the last vaccine injection, and used to assess the ability of the vaccines induced antibodies to neutralize CPV-2 and CPV-2c antigens by seroneutralization (SN) assays. SN titer below 10 1,17 was considered as negative. All results are expressed in mean AE standard deviation, in log10 units.In both studies, none of the cat sera was able to neutralize CPV-2 or CPV-2c antigen prior vaccination. At four weeks after the last vaccine injection for primary vaccination, whatever the study, kittens vaccinated with either Leucofeligen TM FeLV/RCP (9/9 from study A and 15/15 from study B) or Feligen TM CRP (11/11 from study B) were able to neutralize both CPV-2 and CPV-2c antigens. After vaccination, SN titers against CPV-2 were respectively 3.35 AE 0.69, 4.02 AE 0.54 and 4.03 AE 0.86 for sera of kittens vaccinated with Leucofeligen TM FeLV/RCP in study A, study B and kittens vaccinated with Feligen TM CRP from study B. CPV-2c SN titers obtained post vaccination were, for the same groups, 3.35 AE 0.65, 4.03 AE 0.51 and 3.97 AE 0.82. No significant difference could be demonstrated for any CPV-2 variant and for any vaccine (P > 0.05).Cats vaccinated with either Leucofeligen TM FeLV/RCP and Feligen TM CRP vaccines developed an acquired immunity against CPV variants. Based on the correlation between seroneutralizing antibodies and protection for parvovirus, both Leucofeligen TM FeLV/RCP and Feligen TM CRP vaccines protect cats against parvovirosis due to CPV variants.Disclosures: Disclosures to report.

Therefore a combination of compulsory and voluntary actions was implemented in the last 5 years to reduce AMU in animals in the Netherlands. In food producing animals, a considerable reduction in AMU has been accomplished over the last years. Previous research in companion animals showed that total AMU in companion animals is relatively low, but large differences between clinics exist and especially in the choice of antimicrobial agents there is room for improvement. Therefore from the end of 2014 onwards, an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) was developed and implemented stepwise in 44 Dutch companion animal clinics. Aims of present study are to calculate Defined Daily Dosages (DDDs) from these 44 clinics before start of the ASP implementation and to identify clinic related factors influencing AMU in these Dutch companion animal clinics.",
