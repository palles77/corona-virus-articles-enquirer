Cells expressing S fused with receptor-expressing cells at neutral pH suggesting that the recombinant glycoprotein is functional, its membrane fusogenic activity does not require other viral proteins, and that low pH is not required for triggering membrane fusion; fusion was not observed at low receptor concentrations. S and its soluble ectodomain, S e , were not cleaved to any significant degree. They ran at about 180-200 kDa in SDS gels suggesting post-translational modifications as predicted by previous computer analysis and observed for other coronaviruses. Fragments containing the N-terminal amino acid residues 17-537 and 272-537 but not 17-276 bound specifically to Vero E6 cells and purified soluble receptor, ACE2, recently identified by M. Farzan and coworkers [Nature 426 (2003) 450-454]. Together with data for inhibition of binding by antibodies developed against peptides from S, these findings suggest that the receptor-binding domain is located between amino acid residues 303 and 537. These results also confirm that ACE2 is a functional receptor for the SARS virus and may help in the elucidation of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV entry and in the development of vaccine immunogens and entry inhibitors.

            "text": "The SARS-CoV S glycoprotein: expression and functional characterization Viral envelope glycoproteins initiate entry of viruses into cells by binding to cell surface receptors followed by conformational changes leading to membrane fusion and delivery of the genome in the cytoplasm [1] . The spike (S) glycoproteins of coronaviruses are no exception and mediate binding to host cells followed by membrane fusion; they are major targets for neutralizing antibodies and form the characteristic corona of large, distinctive spikes in the viral envelopes [2, 3] . Such 20-to 40-nm complex surface projections also surround the periphery of the SARS-CoV particles [4] . The level of overall sequence similarity between the predicted amino acid sequence of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and the S glycoproteins of other coronaviruses is low (20-27% pairwise amino acid identity) except for some conserved sequences in the S2 subunit [5] . The low level of sequence similarity precludes definite conclusions about functional and structural similarity. The SARS-CoV S glycoprotein has not been characterized biochemically and biophysically, and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) has not been localized. Here we report cloning, expression, and characterization of the SARS-CoV fulllength S glycoprotein and various soluble fragments, demonstration of its fusogenic function at neutral pH, development of a quantitative cell fusion reporter gene-based assay, and localization of the RBD in the N-terminal 303-537 residues.",

Three pBR194c-based plasmids containing overlapping cDNAs that cover the full-length S glycoprotein coding sequence were purchased from the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BC, Canada). The following primers were used for amplification and overlapping PCR cloning of the full-length S glycoprotein: #1, 5 0 AGTCGGATCC GGTAGGCTTATCATTAGAG 3 0 ; #2, 5 0 CCAT CAGGGGAGAA AGG CAC 3 0 ; #3, 5 0 GTGCCTTTCTCCCCTGATGG 3 0 ; #4, 5 0 GA AGAGCAGCGCCAGCACC 3 0 ; #5, 5 0 GGTGCT GGCGCTGCTC TTC 3 0 ; and #6, 5 0 ACTGTCTAGAGTTCGTTT ATGTGTAATG 3 0 . The amplified full-length S gene was cut with BamHI and XbaI and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites in pCDNA3 plasmid to create pCDNA3-S. This plasmid was used to generate various soluble fragments of the S glycoprotein. The pair of primers #7, 5 0 AGTCGGAT CCGACCGGTGCACCACTTTTG 3 0 and #8, 5 0 AGTCGGGCCCCT GTTCAGCAGCAATACC 3 0 was used to amplify the S1 fragment containing residues 17-756. The fragment was cut with BamHI and ApaI and cloned into corresponding sites of expression vector pSecTag2B (Invitrogen). Primer #7 and primer #9 5 0 CTAGCTCGAGCAA-CAGCATCTGTG 3 0 were used to amplify fragment S276 containing residues 17-276. The fragment was cut with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites in the pSecTag2B vector. Fragment S537 was generated by cutting S1 with BamHI and HincII and cloned into pSecTag2B cut with BamHI and EcoRV. To generate soluble S glycoprotein ectodomain, S e , site-directed mutagenesis was performed to create an ApaI site upstream to the transmembrane domain of the S glycoprotein gene in pCDNA3-S. Then this plasmid was digested with PstI and ApaI and the resulting fragment was used to replace the PstI-ApaI fragments from pSecTag2B-S1, creating the pSecTag2B-S e plasmid. PstI-ApaI fragment from pCDNA3-S was used to replace the PstI-ApaI fragment from pSecTag2B-S e to create pSecTag2B-S without tags. To create the fragment containing residues 272-537, the following pair of primers, primer #10 5 0 GATCGGATCCGGTACAATCACAG 3 0 and primer #11 5 0 GATCGGGCCCGACACACTGGTTC 3 0 , was used for PCR amplification. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and ApaI and ligated to pSecTag2B digested with the same restriction enzymes. All S fragments and full-length S constructed in pSecTag2B had their native leader sequence (aa 1-16) replaced with a mouse k chain leader sequence.",

The bands were broad when observed at low exposure ( Fig. 4 and data not shown) . These data indicate significant glycosylation as observed for S glycoproteins from other coronaviruses. Based on approximate estimations of molecular weight it appears that S2 is not as heavily glycosylated as S756. Notably, S276 is heavily glycosylated if one assumes that only glycosylation contributes to the increased molecular mass. Most of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was not cleaved, although we observed weak bands due to smaller proteins, one of which runs at the same position as S756, suggesting the possibility for inefficient cleavage (Fig. 4) . We cannot rule out the possibility of random digestion by proteases. Further studies are needed to determine if the S glycoprotein cleavage is necessary for its function.",

Expression of the full-length S glycoprotein with both vectors, pCDNA3-S and pSectag2B-S, supported fusion with ACE2 expressing cells efficiently, as evidenced by formation of syncytia of various sizes and a b-gal reporter gene-based assay (Fig. 5) . Interestingly, the pSectag2B-S construct in which the S glycoprotein leader peptide was replaced by a mouse k chain leader sequence induced faster formation of syncytia that were larger and more numerous than those induced by pCDNA3-S, which encodes the native S glycoprotein (data not shown). The extent of fusion mediated by S expressed by using pSectag2B-S was also higher than by using pCDNA3-S as measured by a reporter gene-based assay (Fig. 5B) . These data indicate that the S glycoprotein may not be efficiently transported to the cell surface but further studies are required to confirm this possibility.

We were not able to detect statistically significant differences between cells transfected with plasmids encoding the full-length S glycoprotein and various negative controls including plasmids encoding soluble S fragments at different pH (data not shown), suggesting that the higher levels of receptor expression achieved by expression of recombinant ACE2 could be important for cell-cell fusion.

It is also possible that higher levels of S expression could lead to measurable cell fusion, even when the receptor concentrations are relatively low. Overall, these results suggest that recombinant S glycoprotein alone can mediate cell fusion, that fusion can occur at neutral pH, and that its efficiency is dependent on the concentration of the receptor molecules.",

This antibody did not inhibit binding of the S537 fragment to Vero E6 cells although it did bind this fragment ( Fig. 6B and data not shown) , suggesting that the RBD is localized between residues 303 and 537. Because of the relatively large antibody size and the possibility for steric hindrance, one can assume that the RBD is even further downstream of residue 303. By contrast, the RBD for murine hepatitis virus was mapped to the N-terminal 330 amino acids (14). However, recently, the RBD of the HCoV-229E was localized to a fragment containing amino acid residues 407-547 (4, 5) . It remains to be seen whether there is structural similarity of these fragments with the RBD-containing fragments of the SARS-CoV S1 glycoprotein (e.g., S272-537), and whether such similarity is related to the use of the same host for replication, although these two viruses use different receptors.
