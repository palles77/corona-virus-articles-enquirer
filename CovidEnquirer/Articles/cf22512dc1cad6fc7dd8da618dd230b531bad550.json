There are many potential advantages to be gained from using plants as a production system for recombinant proteins. They are higher eukaryotic organisms with an endomembrane system, they fold and assemble recombinant proteins using protein chaperones that are homologous to those in mammalian cells, and they glycosylate proteins. Moreover, they offer the potential to scale up to agricultural proportions, that offers both the possibility to produce proteins in enormous quantities, as well as the prospect of very low cost. An important application area where these benefits could be brought to bear is in the field of vaccine production, particularly in developing countries.",

To date, three examples have been tested in humans-E. coli heat labile toxin, hepatitis B surface antigen and Norwalk virus capsid protein. Overall, proof of principle has been demonstrated for the production of recombinant pharmaceutical in plants.

The benefits were most obvious in patients with pneumococcal meningitis (N Engl J Med 2002; 347:1549 -1556). Adjunctive dexamethasone therapy is now recommended for most adults with suspected pneumococcal meningitis. However, most health care-associated infections are endemic and result from cross-transmission related to inappropriate patient-care practices. To improve healthcare workers' (HCW) compliance with practices, infection control should learn from the behavioural sciences. Infection control professionals play key roles in the identification and prevention of nosocomial infections. They act as observers, educators and, ultimately, should become change agents. Changing behaviour and shifting social norms at multiple levels through the HCW community are among the key challenges of infection control today.",

During the latter half of the 20th century, it was suggested that social behaviour could be best understood as a function of people's perceptions rather than as a function of real life. This assumption gave birth to several models based on social cognitive variables to improve our understanding of human behaviour. Cognitive variables used in these models include: knowledge, motivation, intention, perception of threat, outcome expectancy, perceived and actual behavioural control, and social pressure. These determinants shape behaviour; they are acquired through the socialisation process and, importantly, are susceptible to change. Some social cognitive models (Health Belief Model, Health Locus of Control, Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Self-Efficacy Model) have been applied to evaluate predictors of health behaviour but, so far, none has been successfully applied to explain behaviour in the field of infection control.",

            "text": "Successful strategies to improve infection control practices result from their multidimensional aspect. Successful behaviour change can well by explained by applying the theory of Ecological Perspective, which is based on two key ideas: a) behaviour is viewed as being affected by and affecting multiple levels of influence; b) behaviour both influences and is influenced by the social environment. Levels of influence for health-related behaviours and conditions include intra-personal, inter-personal, institutional, and community factors, as well as administrative support. Intra-personal factors are individual characteristics that influence behaviour such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and personality traits. Inter-personal factors include inter-personal processes and primary groups-family, friends, and peers-that provide social identity, support and role definition. HCWs can be influenced by or are influential in their social environments. Behaviour is often influenced by peer group pressure. Social Cognitive Theory states that people learn not only through their own experiences, but also by observing others' actions and the results of those actions, as well as through modelling. Institutional factors to be considered to promote change include the availability and easy access to rules, policies, as well as technical and informal structures that help to promote recommended behaviours. Responsibilities for each HCWs' individual group must be clearly recognised and defined. Community factors are social networks and norms that exist either formally or informally between individuals, groups, and organisations. For example, in the hospital, the community level would be the ward. Community-level models are frameworks for understanding how social systems function and change, and how communities and organisations can be activated. The conceptual framework of community organisation models is based on social networks and support, focusing on the active participation and development of communities that can help evaluate and solve health problems. Public policy factors include local policies that regulate or support practices for disease prevention, control, and management. The institutional administration must openly support the creation of a multidisciplinary task force to address the problem of infection cross-transmission within the ward or the hospital. By this, it mandates representative members of the multidisciplinary institutional team to come together to identify the problem and to develop strategies to resolve it; it also endorses the choice and options taken and mobilizes the hospital resources needed to implement the strategies.",

Similarly, social models that include several levels of cognitive determinants have more chance of success to explain change in behaviour. Concrete examples applied to infection control issues will be presented. Studies are needed to assess the key determinants of infection control practices and behaviour promotion among the different populations of HCWs, to develop methods to secure senior management support, and to implement and evaluate the impact of the different components of multimodal programmes to promote optimal infection control practices.",

While viruses are small enough that biochemical means and molecular biology help us to get a near-to-complete understanding of all aspects of their developmental life-cycle, bacteria are more complex and by being prokaryotes, too remote from eukaryotes to understand their life-cycle in terms of conjugation and segregation which govern the reproduction of higher organisms. Genetic typing, especially genomic sequence-based typing provides an insight into the genetic population structure of bacteria and can thus address pertinent research questions in taxonomy, evolutionary genetics, microbial ecology and identify the epidemic potential of bacteria. Since evolutionary convergence and parallelism cannot be expected to occur in many genes at the same rate, multilocus approaches yield classifications not only of heuristic but also of epidemiological value.",

Recent research has highlighted the role of a symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia in disease pathogenesis. 2 When the bacteria are released from dead or damaged worms they cause inflammatory reactions associated with the adverse reactions to chemotherapy. 3, 4 Similar activation of innate inflammation by the bacteria causes the inflammatory responses that lead to river blindness. 5 The mutualistic dependence on Wolbachia has been used in a new approach to the treatment of filariasis. 6 Antibiotics have been used to eliminate the endosymbionts, which leads to an arrest of larval and embryonic development and survival and can also lead to the eventual death of adult worms, suggesting the bacteria are essential for their long-term survival. The first trials using doxycycline against human filariasis have been encouraging, with sustained reductions in microfilariae, long-term sterilization in onchocerciasis and potent macrofilaricidal activity in lymphatic filariasis. The use of antibiotics, in addition to perturbing the symbiotic relationship, could also eliminate the cause of filarial disease.",

MMP-9 degrades type IV collagen; a major component of vascular basement membrane and MMP-1 cleaves the chief structural collagens in lung tissue. Tuberculosis is characterised by a necrotising granulomatous immune response but the cause of tissue destruction is poorly understood. Since excessive MMP activity may be destructive, the hypothesis that dysregulated MMP activity causes tissue injury in TB was investigated. In vitro, human monocytic (THP-1) cells infected by live, virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis secreted MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner. At 24 h, MMP-9 concentrations increased 10-fold (p , 0:001 v controls) and de novo MMP-9 mRNA synthesis was detected. In contrast, upregulation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 gene expression and secretion was delayed and less striking. In vivo, MMP-9 concentration per leukocyte in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from tuberculous meningitis patients \u00f0n \u00bc 23\u00de was higher than in bacterial \u00f0n \u00bc 12\u00de or viral meningitis \u00f0n \u00bc 20\u00de \u00f0p , 0:01\u00de: TIMP-1 concentrations were similar in tuberculous compared with bacterial meningitis or controls. Thus, a phenotype in which MMP-9 activity is relatively unrestricted by TIMP-1 developed in vitro and in vivo. In addition, MMP-9 concentrations/CSF leukocyte (but not TIMP-1 levels) was elevated in fatal tuberculous meningitis and in patients with signs of cerebral damage (unconsciousness, confusion, or neurological deficit; p , 0:05). However, there was no relationship with severity of systemic illness.",

Anti-TNF-antibody (but not IL-1 receptor antagonist) pre-treatment inhibited MMP-9 secretion induced by CoMTB, or by direct infection, by 50% (p \u00bc 0:0001 and 0.0002 respectively). CoMTB and TNF-independently stimulated dose-dependent MMP-9 secretion. Pertussis toxin inhibited CoMTB-induced MMP-9 secretion and enhanced the inhibitory effect of TNF-blockade \u00f0p \u00bc 0:05\u00de; thus implicating chemokines in the network. Finally, the effects of antiinflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13) on M. tuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells suggested that MMP activity might be inadequately suppressed.

Success rates vary from 75-90% for a one stage procedure and 70-100% in two stages. Success is most likely if all foreign and non-viable material, including cement, is removed. The timing of the two stages and route/duration of antibiotics varies between institutions and studies. Some advocate an aspiration biopsy (off antibiotics) prior to the decision to reimplant. Clearly if the joint is still clinically infected or inflammatory markers still high, a re-debridement ('second first stage') is needed prior to considering re-implantation. For knees, a cement spacer is inserted between the two stages. For hips, many surgeons leave the joint with no spacer. Alternatives include cement beads or PROSTALAC implants that aim to preserve function. These devices can contain antibiotics.",

Relapses are usually re-infections with different strains; switching between metronidazole and vancomycin and vice versa in patients with symptomatic recurrences is therefore illogical.

Since the Cooke report of 1995 1 Infection Control Teams (ICTs) have been encouraged to carry out surveillance of healthcareassociated infections (HCAI). Two national prevalence surveys of HCAI 2,3 have been carried out but surveillance of HCAI has been limited to alert organisms/conditions and a few surgical procedures. However, following the National Audit Office Report 'The Management and Control of Hospital Acquired infection in Acute NHS Trusts in England' 4 greater emphasis has been placed on the need for prospective surveillance of HCAI. Currently ICTs are required to report MRSA bacteraemias and the outcome of elective orthopaedic procedures. In the near future, pressure will be on the ICTs to produce surveillance data on a wider range of alert organisms/conditions and surgical site infections (SSIs) e.g. Clostridium difficile, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, caesarean sections etc. However, the resources needed to carry out these additional studies are not yet in place in many parts of the UK. This workshop will look at the staff and skills required by an ICT to carry out these mandatory surveillance tasks. As an example, the scenario of SSI surveillance will be examined in more detail. This will include the use of core and local datasets, methodologies, definitions and means of data collection. One way forward is to introduce the concept of an 'Infection Control Surveillance Co-ordinator' who will facilitate the whole process. Such a person may require additional training in basic data handling and analysis but these and other skills should be made available to other members of the ICT. The co-ordinator could be from the existing ICT or from others with an appropriate scientific, IT or clerical background.",

Results: Most of the West Indian population were born in the UK and thought to have acquired their infection locally. VNTR types tended to be clustered, the Harlem clade, 32333, being most commonly represented. The newly identified X clade, 32433, was seen in 7 patients, 5 of whom were born in the West Indies. There was a group of 11 patients with identical MIRU profiles. Traditional contact tracing had not previously identified links between these individuals, although they are geographically clustered. This information will direct further epidemiological inquiry and may explain the on going excess rates of tuberculosis within this community. In contrast, most of the African populations were recent arrivals in the UK and had disease as a result of re-activation of latent infection rather than from local spread. There was minimal clustering of VNTR profiles. In previous work, we identified an attenuated mutant containing a disruption in the lctP gene, predicted to encode a protein with 21% identity and 58% similarity with a lactate permease from E. coli. To examine the role of the lctP gene on lactate utilisation by N. meningitidis, the growth of strain MC58DlctP in single carbon sources was compared against the wild-type strain. The two strains grew equally well in 10 mM glucose, while the lactate permease mutant was defective for growth in media with lactate as the sole carbon source. In addition, uptake studies demonstrated that the mutant is incapable of assimilating lactate. Metabolic studies showed that growth of the wild type bacterium, though not that of the mutant, is enhanced by the addition of lactate to media containing glucose. Furthermore the survival of the mutant (MC58DlctP) in normal human sera was only 16% that of the wild-type.",

Immunosuppression [OR 3.9, CI 1. Histamine is commonly found in biological tissues at low concentrations, but may be associated with scombroid poisoning following the ingestion of spoiled foods that have been contamination with enteric bacteria. Often in wounds, little importance is attributed to the presence of enteric bacteria, yet the ability of these organisms to produce histamine may have clinical significance. The aim of this study was to determine whether bacteria isolated from infected wounds had the potential to produce histamine in vitro. Cultures of Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 23355, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13383, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 13315, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12228, together with 49 clinical isolates of Gram negative bacteria were screened for the production of histamine, using each of four differential media supplemented with histidine. Bacteria were incubated in M9 minimal medium supplemented with histidine at 37 8C for up to 5 days and culture supernatants collected and filtered. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) and enzyme analysis was used to test for the presence of histamine in culture filtrates. The use of differential media for the detection of histamine was judged to be unreliable, with Pseudomonas giving false positives. TLC indicated that only 4/54 isolates were seen to produce histamine. Enzyme assays demonstrated substantial production of histamine in 4 strains of Morganella morganii (,2000 ppm histamine), and lower concentrations in one strain of Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae (5 strains), Escherichia coli (4 strains), and Klebsiella spp. (8 strains). Histamine was not detected in Proteus mirabilis (4 strains), Proteus vulgaris (1 strain) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 strains). This is the first report of the in vitro production of histamine in bacteria isolated from wounds. It is possible that histamine production by bacteria in wounds may lead to symptoms of inflammation that may be mistaken for infection. Despite a great increase in our understanding of the molecular biology of the viruses associated with acute upper respiratory tract viral infections (URTI) there is a remarkable lack of knowledge and ideas about why URTI should exhibit a seasonal incidence. Publications in this area acknowledge a lack of any explanation for the seasonality of URTI or put forward an explanation related to an increased 'crowding' of susceptible persons in winter. The incidence of URTI such as common cold and influenza exhibit seasonal fluctuations with a peak of respiratory illness during the winter months. Winter seasonality has been reported for a wide range of viruses: orthomyxoviruses (influenza), paramyxoviruses (RSV, parainfluenza), coronaviruses, picornaviruses (common cold), herpes viruses, and adenoviruses. Viruses which may cause systemic illness but which gain entrance to the body via the upper respiratory tract, such as certain paramyxovirus infections (measles, mumps) and varicella-zoster infection (chicken pox), also show a similar winter seasonality. Lower respiratory tract diseases such as pneumonia, which may be viral or bacterial in aetiology, also show a similar seasonal pattern with the peak of illness in winter. This presentation will discuss some of the ideas concerning seasonality of URTI and put forward a new hypothesis for discussion-that seasonal exposure to cold air causes an increase in the incidence of URTI due to cooling of the nasal airway. The hypothesis proposes that inhalation of cold air causes cooling of the nasal epithelium, and that this reduction in nasal temperature is sufficient to inhibit local respiratory defences against infection such as mucociliary clearance and the phagocytic activity of leukocytes. A case will also be made that warming of the nasal airway as a consequence of nasal congestion may help to resolve a current URTI. Introduction: Adherence to antiretroviral medication is known to be highly important in achieving viral suppression and preventing early emergence of resistance. The complexity of regimes and tablet burden make adherence difficult and when this is combined with the chaotic nature of the lives of some HIV patients, it is not surprising that failure to adhere to regimes is common. Text messaging is cheap and accessible and automated texting to large numbers of patients has been shown to be acceptable and useful in the management of other chronic illnesses. However, it was felt that the potential stigma which still surrounds HIV would make text messaging about HIV unpopular with the majority of HIV patients.",

It has an endopeptidase domain that cleaves the pentaglycine cross-linker that strengthens the cell wall of S. aureus. Producing cells are resistant to killing by lysostaphin due to the incorporation of serine residues in the pentaglycine crosslinker. Lysostaphin also has a targeting domain, that allows lysostaphin to bind to S. aureus cells, however the actual 'receptor molecule' has not been identified. We are carrying out a research programme aimed at widening our current limited understanding of the biology of lysostaphin. We have (1) developed a rapid purification protocol for the mature lysostaphin; (2) developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay of endopeptidase activity; (2) identified conserved residues in the endopeptidase domain in an alignment of lysostaphin homologues; and (3) mutated the conserved residues in the endopeptidase domain, using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, and showed loss of biological and endopeptidase activity in the purified mutant proteins.",

Results: 946 patient episodes across the seven directorates of cardiology, care of the elderly, haematology, medicine, neurology, orthopaedics and surgery were analysed. 893 of 1074 (83%) AMT inputs were interventional. No significant detrimental effect on either patient mortality or length of stay as a result of stopping antibiotics was identified. In 3.1% of patient episodes the advice given by the AMT was not adopted by the attending physicians. In 55% (6/11) cases this was due to new clinical circumstances arising after the ward round. The remaining 5 episodes were rectified by the AMT the following week. The AMT ward rounds reduced use of intravenous antimicrobials by up to 48% and made direct antimicrobial cost savings on the ward round day of up to 42%. Total cost savings to the Trust ranged from \u00a317k-\u00a3107k per annum dependent on the number of days that the antibiotic changes made by the AMT pre-empted similar decisions by the attending team. This represents up to 14% of the annual antibiotic budget for some directorates. The total cost saving to the Trust in terms of nursing time saved and prevention of health-care associated infection (HCAI) is much greater.",

The increasing emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is of major concern for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. This prospective study aimed to examine the antibiotic usage on a 9 bed adult ICU and the relationship with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonisation. During an initial 8 months period all patients admitted to ICU for .24 h were included in the study; demographic and antibiotic data were collected and enhanced MRSA screening. Two hundred and fifteen patients were included, of which 26% were colonised with MRSA. Eighty eight per cent of patients received at least 1 antibiotic, with a mean of 2. Despite being used primarily as surgical prophylaxis agents, cefuroxime and metronidazole were the two most heavily prescribed antibiotics, with both being prescribed for extended periods. All evidence based guidelines for surgical prophylaxis recommend one dose on induction and we therefore implemented an educational programme involving the microbiologists, surgeons, pharmacists and anaesthetists to advocate one off surgical prophylaxis on induction. After the education programme a second period of data collection and MRSA screening took place and to date 37 patients have been included; 24% of which were colonised with MRSA and 86% have received at least 1 antibiotic. Cefuroxime and metronidazole usage has been reduced from 20.6 to 3.8 DDD/100 bed days and 33.1 to 13.8 DDD/100 bed days respectively. There has been an increased usage of tazocin, but other antibiotic usage has remained relatively constant. We have demonstrated that by using a multidisciplinary approach it is possible to reduce the post surgical prophylactic usage of antibiotics on the ICU; thereby potentially reducing the antibiotic selective pressure and in the long term the presence of multi resistant bacteria. Objectives: Cell wall-deficient bacteria (CWDB) have been associated with numerous disease processes, however, we still do not completely understand the factors that cause the loss of cell wall, in vivo, or the consequences of cell wall-deficiency on bacterial metabolism. Our objectives were to characterise the changes in antibiotic sensitivity and cell wall structure that occur when Staphylococcus aureus cells adopt a transient cell walldeficient phenotype.",

Due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant wound-infecting bacteria, there is a need to develop new topical antimicrobial agents. One ancient remedy currently being re-considered is honey. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated in vitro, but if honey is to be an effective inhibitor in vivo it must retain potency in the presence of serum proteins, and this has not yet been tested. Using two wound pathogens, the aim of this investigation was to determine whether the presence of serum proteins affected the bactericidal activity of New Zealand manuka honey. Sterile manuka honey (potency equivalent to 19%w/v phenol) was used to determine Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) NCTC 10017 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by serial dilution in nutrient broth (Oxoid) with a microtitre plate method. Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) was determined by plating onto nutrient agar (Oxoid). To determine the effect of serum proteins on antibacterial activity, nutrient broth was replaced by 90% foetal calf serum (FCS). In the absence of FCS, MRSA was more sensitive to manuka honey than Pseud. aeruginosa with MIC values of 2.8% (w/v) and 15% (w/v) respectively. MBCs of 7% and 20.6% respectively, indicated that the mode of action was bactericidal. In the presence of FCS, MICs increased by a factor of approximately 4 and 2, respectively, and activity was bactericidal. These results suggest that although components in FCS reduce the antibacterial activity of a manuka honey in vitro, bactericidal activity against two wound pathogens was still present following dilution by a factor of at least 4.",

Significant contamination problems occurred during optimalisation but were completely controlled by use of the enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG), indicating carryover contamination rather than cross contamination. The sensitivity of the PCR reaction when used on DNA from the type strain of M. tuberculosis, H37Rv, was 5 fentograms (5 \u00a3 10 215 g) or 15 targets. This sensitivity, as well as the specificity of the PCR reaction, was confirmed on Southern blot. The internal primers, which were designed and used to make the radiolabelled probe for the Southern blot, would be suitable for use in the development of a nested PCR. Discitis is an inflammatory process of the intervertebral discs which usually involves the vertebral end plates and may extend into the adjacent tissues. Application of magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of discitis has led to increased awareness, and culture of disc aspirates has highlighted the bacterial aetiology. A retrospective study of the clinical presentation, investigation and antibiotic treatment of discitis was carried out between August 1996 and September 2002 by review of the clinical notes and laboratory records at the Taunton & Somerset Hospital.",

This includes emerging entero pathogenic and toxic E. coli and Shigella organisms transmitted by untreated water and unhygenically prepared foods. The study that has been going on for 14 years in Kenya shows the breakdown of public health facilities, use of untreated water, poverty resulting in unhygienic housing and misuse of antibiotics in trying to treat enteric pathogens thus increasing the mortality and morbidity especially on HIV/AIDS people. This shows that although the current enterotoxigenic E. coli are sensitive to new introduced quinolones and cephalosporions, these drugs kill the bacteria but they are not effective on already produced toxins in patients gut. This calls for a new approach to control spread and managing toxin-producing food poisoning agents and neutralize toxins produced.

Interestingly bacteraemic IDUs are older than the general IDU population in Northeast Glasgow which suggests an association between duration of drug use and the severity of the septic complications. This increased risk of bacteraemic complications may be explained by them having to resort to skin and muscle popping as their venous access is lost. Teicoplanin, a bactericidal glycopeptide, plays an important role against Grampositive bacterial infections. Monitoring teicoplanin levels is currently not a routine practice due to a variety of reasons. The UK recommendation suggests that therapeutic monitoring may optimise dose and serum trough level should not be less than 10 mg/l. Recently several studies revealed a substantial proportion of studied populations had a concentration of less than 10 mg/l under the standard dosage, raising a concern that some of the patients may not have been properly treated. However, It can be argued that vast majority of patients had a concentration above MIC of 4 mg/l. The aim of this study was to examine the difference of clinical responses between the patients with serum trough level 4-10 mg/l and those having level of more than 10 mg/l. Clinical responses were assessed changes of body temperature, WCC and CRP around five days after starting administration. So far 48 patients have been studied, 3 patients (6.3%) had serum trough levels less than 4 mg/l and were not included in the data analysis, Group A with levels of 4 -10 mg/l had 17 (35.4%) patients and Group B with levels greater than 10 mg/l had 28 (58.3%) patients. The mean concentration in group A was 7.3 mg/l with a standard deviation of 1.5; whereas the mean was 27.2 mg/l and 21.3 respectively in group B. A significant difference was observed in WCC change between the two groups, with 72.7% in group A and 22.2% in group B, showing a reduction in WCC; whereas no significant change was noticed in CRP between the groups. On the whole there was no difference of clinical response between patients with a serum level of 4-10 mg/l and those with more than 10 mg/l. The study is on going and more patients and longer observation time arrive at a conclusion. A 45 year old woman underwent an uncomplicated lumbosacral discectomy (L5, S1). Five days later, she was admitted with severe back pain. X-rays were unhelpful. A presumptive diagnosis of post-operative wound infection was made. Intravenous (iv) vancomycin and oral rifampicin were started, empirically. There was no clinical improvement and after two weeks she was transferred to our institution. On presentation, her maximum temperature was 39 8C, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 128 mm/hr and C reactive protein (CRP) was 221 mg/l. At reoperation, pus and fragments of disc were removed. Five of five intra-operative specimens were positive for Enterobacter on culture. A diagnosis of Enterobacter osteomyelitis was made. Vancomycin and rifampicin were discontinued and she received two weeks of amikacin 1 g, daily plus meropenem 2 g, three times daily. There was dramatic improvement clinically. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) was inserted and the patient was discharged to receive ertapenem, 1 g iv once daily for a further four weeks.

UK data of hospital acquired bacteraemia exists, but does not record rates per catheter days. The method used here allows the calculations of this more useful rate as opposed to numbers of catheters infected. The rate measured total bacteraemias, not just primary line associated infections. The computerized coding system failed to record all the lines inserted; missing many critical care episodes. Retrospective review was time consuming but is likely to result in accurate bacteraemia rates. The measured rate suggests that locally antimicrobial impregnated lines would be cost effective. Methods: Horizontal surfaces were sampled with contact plates, and air was sampled with a Surface Air Sampler (SAS) and settle plates, twice a week for up to four weeks in the rooms of patients isolated for MRSA in a hospital where MRSA is endemic. All plates were incubated for 48 hours and isolates were identified and antibiotic susceptibility testing performed using standards methods.",

It also highlights that acquisition of ESbLs may be one of the alternate mechanisms of multi-antibiotic resistance in E. cloacae strains in addition to chromosomally encoded cephalosporinases. Methods: Retrospective analysis of presumptively infected prosthetic joints undergoing radiological biopsy to aid diagnosis in patients managed in a specialist musculoskeletal infection unit. Data were obtained by cross-referencing the Microbiology database (Sunquest, Persoft Inc.) with prospective Radiology and Histology databases. Histology was used as the criterion standard for diagnosing infection. Conclusions: Prosthetic joint biopsy is more specific than sensitive for the diagnosis of PJI. Taking multiple samples, and using prolonged culture techniques may improve sensitivity, as the sensitivity of an individual sample is only approximately 20%. We advocate taking at least two biopsy samples for culture, using prolonged incubation, and sending material for histology. The study also highlights difficulties in evaluating diagnostic tests when robust consensus definitions of infection are lacking.

Data collected on 24 808 hip arthroplasties from 102 hospitals in England between 1997 and 2001 were analysed to estimate the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) and strength of association with major risk factors. Demographic, operative and infection data on in-patients was collected prospectively over a four-year period by hospitals participating in the Nosocomial Infection National Surveillance Service (NINSS). Generalised linear models were used to estimate the associations between potential risk factors and SSI after allowing for confounding. The incidence of SSI was 2.2% in primary total hip arthroplasties, 5% in primary hemarthroplasties, and 3.7% and 7.6% in revision total hip arthroplasties and revision hemiarthroplasties respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was identified in 50% of SSI; 59% of these were methicillin resistant (MRSA). In hemiarthoplasties, MRSA was a causative pathogen in 40% of SSI. Most SSI were superficial (75%), but 9% involved bone or joint. The multivariable regression analysis identified age group, trauma, duration of operation and ASA score as significant independent risk factors for SSI. When these factors were taken into account, type of arthroplasty was not a significant predictor of risk of SSI. After allowing for these factors there was still significant interhospital variation in rates of SSI, which was still evident when the length of post-operative stay was taken into account. Patients undergoing hemarthroplasty are older, have higher ASA scores and are more likely to have surgery as a result of trauma. The variation in incidence of SSI following hip arthroplasty is more likely to be explained by these characteristics than the type of procedure. The variation in incidence of SSI between hospitals is not fully explained by case-mix, but comparisons of rates should take into account significant risk factors. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen in SSI of hip arthroplasty, especially in patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty.

Conclusions: People under twenty increasingly availed of this STD clinic. Females comprised the larger part of attendees. Most attended with symptoms rather than for screening. Genital warts remained the commonest reason for assessment, but incidence of Chlamydia appeared to trend upwards. The low level of condom use is of concern. Substance misuse is of concern for sexual and general health. and increased with increasing maternal antibody titre (x 1 2 \u00bc 48, p , 0:001). 15% (145/978) of mothers had detectable HHV8 DNA in saliva (mean viral copy number 488,450 copies/ml, range 1550-660,000); the prevalence was 10% (51/532) in HHV8 seronegative women and 33% (71/216) in women with the highest antibody titres (OR \u00bc 4.6, 95% CI 3.0 -6.9). The prevalence of anti-HHV8 antibodies in children was 15% (109/735) if the mother had no detectable HHV8 in saliva and 28% (12/43) if the mother had a high HHV8 copy number (.50,000) in saliva (OR \u00bc 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.5). Among 43 women with high anti-HHV8 antibody titres, 12 had detectable HHV8 DNA in breast milk, but at lower levels than in saliva (mean viral copy number 5800 copies/ml, range 1550-12,540).Interpretation. We provide evidence of motherto-child transmission of HHV8 and that maternal saliva is a likely route. Commonly, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with herpes simplex (HSV) encephalitis/ meningitis show normal glucose levels. A case of herpes simplex encephalitis with unusually low CSF glucose is presented. We also reviewed 21 previous glucose measurements from 29 HSV PCR positive CSF samples taken between 1996 and 2003. The CSF glucose range was ,1 to 12 mmol/L, with a mean of 3.6, SD 2.5. The ratio of CSF: serum glucose ranged from 0.07 to 0.64 with a mean of 0.46, SD 0.17. One other patient had a CSF glucose of ,1 associated with HSV meningitis. With the advent of molecular diagnostics a wider spectrum of HSV encephalitis/meningitis is now being recognised, and our series suggests that a low CSF glucose value does not rule out this diagnosis.

There is increased risk with foreign travel to countries with a high incidence of measles and in patients with no clear history of vaccination. This may become an increasing diagnosis in the UK given the recent controversies over the MMR vaccination program. Noroviruses (NV) are the most common cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis and are of particular concern in healthcare settings. The Dako enzyme immunoassay (EIA) has been shown to have a sensitivity of 55.5% and specificity of 98% for norovirus diagnosis compared to RT-PCR. In this retrospective analysis we evaluated in our laboratory the impact of changing outbreak investigation methods from EM to EIA. We collected and analysed data during 2 consecutive winter seasons 2001 and 2002. During the winter of 2001, 282 faecal specimens from 91 outbreaks were investigated for NV by EM, and 9 (3%) were positive. 155 specimens from 64 outbreaks negative by EM were also examined by RT-PCR and an additional 37 (24%) specimens were found to be positive. The increase in positive cases and consequently the number of outbreaks diagnosed in the second season could be due to the increased sensitivity of the EIA. The noticeable increase in the reporting of NV outbreaks in the United Kingdom during the winter season of 2002-2003 could be explained in part by the fact that many laboratories have probably introduced more sensitive diagnostic methods, i.e. EIA. The EIA is less labour-intensive than EM, could be performed more frequently and has the ability to process more samples, which explains the noticeable reduction in turnaround time between the two seasons.

In the Spring term of 2003 it became apparent that there was an outbreak of mumps among the 42,000 students in the University of Sheffield and Hallam University, Sheffield. In total 247 cases were seen by health professionals between January and June 2003, 213 being linked to one of the two Universities. The attack rate rose to approximately 1:50 among 18-year-old students. 10% of student cases were hospitalised, the majority being managed in the local Department of Infectious Diseases.

The second most frequent virus was coronavirus with 16 cases, followed by calicivirus (9). Other viruses included adenovirus (8), astrovirus (6) and parvovirus (1). HRV was more frequently identified in children ,2 years old. The RT-PCR successfully typed 139 of the 146 (95%) HRV G types and 124 (85%) P types.

Two cases of cutaneous zygomycosis acquired by inoculation due to C. bertholletiae have been reported previously, raising the possibility that the infection may have been introduced by home blood glucose monitoring in this case. Patients in whom such procedures are required, particularly those with other risk factors, may be at increased risk of infection. Infection of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) by Staphylococcus aureus is common and associated with increased mortality, due to compromisation from co-morbidities. Whilst elimination of nasal carriage of S. aureus is known to be a useful health protection measure in some patient groups, its status and role in diabetes mellitus is controversial and unknown in DFU patients. We therefore sampled the anterior nares and ulcers of 98 DFU outpatients to isolate S. aureus. Macrorestriction with Sma I was used to distinguish or match ulcer and nasal isolates from individual patients. As a control, 111 healthy individuals (medical students) at the same institution had nasal swabs taken for culture to determine a baseline carriage rate. Of the 98 DFU patients, 38 (38.7%) were nasal carriers of S. aureus. All but one patient had S. aureus isolated from their ulcers. This was significantly different from the controls, 28 (25.2%) of whom were carriers \u00f0P , 0:05\u00de: 78.9% of DFU isolates were penicillin-resistant, compared to only 12.3% of S. aureus in baseline controls. Macrorestriction determined that 35 (92.1%) of the 38 DFU patients with nasal carriage had the same strain of S. aureus in their ulcer \u00f0P , 0:001\u00de: The positive and negative predictive values of a nose swab as a simple measure to determine whether a DFU is likely to be infected or not, were 85.0% and 92.1%, respectively. Nasal carriage of S. aureus is therefore linked to infection of DFU and protocols for its eradication are required to protect these patients against infection. Out of the 20 who were PCR positive, 14 had CMV disease and 6 had infection (of which 4 received pre-emptive treatment).",

After discharge, followup in out-patients or in distant referring centres lead to delays in CMV surveillance. Lack of confidence in the protocol may have resulted in some unnecessary use of intravenous ganciclovir. Following review, we have now introduced prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir (90 days) for all CMV-mismatched liver transplants. A standard pro-forma was used to collect patient data including age, sex, primary diagnosis, type of transplant, immunosuppressive therapy, respiratory symptoms, specimens collected, laboratory diagnosis, antimicrobial agents used (antiviral, antibacterial etc) and outcome of these infections.

            "text": "Respiratory viral infection is increasingly reported as important cause of morbidity and mortality in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. In the recent past, considerable experience has been gained regarding the role of viruses including RSV, influenza A, PIV and adenoviruses, there is however relatively little data describing the role of rhinovirus infections in these patients. This report highlights the increasing importance of rhinovirus chest infection in causing morbidity and mortality in BMT patients. Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis is a serious human infection that almost always leads to death, however the pathogenic mechanisms associated with this disease remain unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest that haematogenous spread is a prerequisite for Acanthamoeba encephalitis but it is not clear how circulating amoebae cross the blood-brain barrier to gain entry into the central nervous system. We have recently developed an in vitro blood-brain barrier model using human brain micorvascular endothelial cells. Using this model, we determined the effects of Acanthamoeba (encephalitis isolate belonging to T1 genotype) on blood-brain barrier permeability and factors responsible for these changes. We observed that Acanthamoeba produced more than 60% increase in the bloodbrain barrier permeability. To determine whether Acanthamoeba mediated increased permeability is contact-independent, Acanthamoeba conditioned media were produced and incubated with the blood-brain barrier. A timedependent increase in permeability was observed with more than 60% permeability within 5 h of incubation. Prior treatment of conditioned media with PMSF (a serine protease inhibitor), abolished permeability changes indicating the role of serine proteases. Of interest, alpha-mannose inhibited Acanthamoeba binding to human brain microvascular endothelial cells but increased the blood-brain barrier permeability. Zymography assays revealed that Acanthamoeba produced three distinct proteases, two of which were inhibited by PMSF. In conclusion, we have, for the first time, shown that Acanthamoeba produces blood-brain barrier permeability which can be blocked by PMSF, indicating the potential role of serine proteases. Further understanding of the mechanisms associated with Acanthamoeba encephalitis will allow us to develop novel strategies to prevent this serious infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae normally resides in the human nasopharynx in a nondisease state. In response to yet unknown triggers it can invade mucosal surfaces and enter the bloodstream causing disease. Regulation and activation of virulence genes play essential roles in this process of disease development. Characterization of S. pneumoniae regulatory networks has been a recent area of interest but despite inroads there is little known about regulation of virulence genes in this pathogen. A putative transcriptional regulator in S. pneumoniae, MgrA, with homology to a virulence gene activator, mga, of Group A streptococcus (GAS) was identified as being required for development of pneumonia in a murine model. In this work we confirm that mgrA is required for both nasopharyngeal carriage and pneumonia.",

Apoptosis induction contributes to bacterial clearance. Members of the genus Shigella are pathogens of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans, causing severe and sometimes fatal bacillary dysentery responsible for approximately one million deaths annually. Shigella spp. can invade the mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract and initiate an acute and intense inflammatory reaction that leads to the destruction of epithelium and breakdown of the intestinal barrier. However, far less is known about how the bacterium survives within the hostile environment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; Shigella spp. must be extremely adept at this critical initial phase of pathogenesis as only 1-10 microorganisms given orally are sufficient to cause diarrhoea in healthy volunteers.",

Stone 1 Academic Dept Geriatric Medicine, Royal Free Campus, Royal Free and University College Medical School 1 , Pharmacy Department 2 and Department of Medical Microbiology 3 Royal Free NHS Trust, London, UKBackground: Optimal antibiotic prescribing has become a NHS priority in a drive to reduce antimicrobial resistance and health care associated infection.(HCAI). Systematic review suggests that regular feedback is the most effective measure to alter health care workers behaviour. We examined the effect of regular feedback to doctors of antibiotic usage on antibiotic prescribing rates. The effect on rates of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), a common form of HCAI and an unwanted side effect of antibiotic use, was also examined.Methods: A prospective interrupted time series study, lasting 42 months(September 1999-March 2003), with pre-defined pre-and post-intervention periods, was carried out in the acute medical wards for elderly people and included 6129 admissions. In July 2001 a new 'narrow spectrum' antibiotic policy was drawn up, recommending less use of Augmentin, increased use of Benzyl Penicillin, Trimethoprim and Amoxycillin and further restricting cephalosporin use. Doctors were given a laminated pocket version of the policy and received feedback, every 8 weeks, of individual antibiotic usage together with CDI rates.",

Nine other patients had infected non-unions, five with bacteriological confirmation of infection at operation. Patients had been treated surgically on average five times previously (Range 1 to 13) for their infections for an average of 10 years (Range 0.5 to 49). A regimen of 4-hourly drainage and local antibiotic instillation, usually with teicoplanin, was used over a three-week period. Streptokinase instilled into the central lumen overcame system blockage in all cases. Systemic antibiotics were also given as indicated by operative and subsequent drainage cultures and usually for a period of 6 weeks after discharge from hospital.Results: At follow up of a mean 44 months (range 2 to 73) the mean C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level had reduced to 6 (Range 1 to 25) from 74(Range 5 to 158) at initial presentation. This was achieved with an average of 1.3 procedures (range 1 to 3), with 77% of patients considered as successful outcomes with no subsequent surgery required. Cultures of antibiotic-free irrigant fluid improved microbiological monitoring of continuing/super infection. Emergence of Gram negative superinfection lead to adoption of a standard teicoplanin-gentamicin mixture in the irrigant.Conclusions: Debridement, local teicoplanin and streptokinase can reduce the number of operations and increase flexibility of chemotherapy in chronic osteomyelitis.P46 VANCOMYCIN-HETEROINTERMEDIATE STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS (H-VISA) AMONG METHICILLIN-RESISTANT (MRSA) AND METHICILLIN-SENSITIVE (MSSA) S.

A. Casey 1 , T. Worthington 1 , P. Lambert 2 and T. Elliott 1 Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Control 1 , University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust, and School of Life and Health Sciences 2 , Aston University, Birmingham, UKThe microbiological diagnosis of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) is primarily based on the recovery of identical microorganisms from the catheter tip and blood culture (based on species and antibiogram). The major cause of CRBSI are the coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) and confirmation of their identity is commonly based on biochemical profiles and antibiogram. The aim of this study was to determine if these laboratory methods for identifying CoNS are sufficiently discriminatory to facilitate the diagnosis of CR-BSI. Eight bone marrow transplant patients with a clinical diagnosis of CR-BSI were recruited into the study. Patients had routine blood and catheter tip cultures performed, all of which yielded CoNS. For each patient, 8 representative colonial types of CoNS (3 from blood culture and 5 from the catheter tip) were characterised phenotypically by antibiogram and biotype (API ID 32 STAPH) and by SmaI chromosome macrorestriction profiles using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Analysis of all isolates studied demonstrated that PFGE distinguished more strains of CoNS compared to biotyping or antibiograms (20, 16 and 14 respectively). Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of multiple strains of CoNS correlated in only 5 out of 8 patients. Four out of 5 of these patients had identical microorganisms from both blood culture and catheter tip thus supporting the clinical diagnosis of CR-BSI. Genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of CoNS recovered from the remaining 3 patients did not correlate. Characterisation of multiple colonies of CoNS recovered from blood and catheter tip cultures revealed that strains were heterogeneous in 4 out of 8 patients which did not support the clinical diagnosis of CR-BSI. Characterisation of CoNS based on biotype and antibiogram lacks discriminatory power. In addition, selection of multiple colonies of CoNS for characterisation should be routinely undertaken for facilitating the diagnosis of CR-BSI as identification of a single colony may lead to misinterpretation.P73 MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY OF AN OUTBREAK OF MULTI-ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE IN AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT OF A DISTRICT GENERAL HOSPITAL IN MERSEYSIDE D.

Using the longerestablished examples of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (Lassa, Ebola, Marburg and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fevers), the necessary steps to recognise and manage imported viral infections will be discussed. ready availability of operable protocols and policies for continuing care; and capability to 'scale up' in the event of an extending problem. It is clear that the maintenance of a body of knowledge and skills, adaptable to emerging demands, is critical to the ability to respond to these challenges.Bites from UK bats can cause rabies in humans.",

Replacement of drug-susceptible by DR strains of the agent of tuberculosis (TB) is observed elsewhere, especially in social unfortunate countries.Objective of the study were both to evaluate prevalence of DR TB in Tula and to compare prevalence of DR TB between resident and prison population.Conclusion: Prevalence of DR TB in Tula is very high. The number of the strains, resistant to any drug, from prisoners was greater, than that from residents.Methods: DNA was extracted from M. tuberculosis cultured from 87 patients in Birmingham with tuberculosis, from two distinct ethnic groups, during the years 1999 to 2002.

Davies 3 Department of Microbiology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, L78XP 1 ; Departments of Microbiology 2 and Care of the Elderly 3 , Sunderland Royal Hospital, Sunderland SR4 7TP, UK Introduction: Linezolid is the first drug issued from the oxazolidinones, a novel class of antimicrobial agents with potent activity against gram-positive pathogens. Treatment of endocarditis caused by resistant gram-positive organisms like vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), methi-cillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and more recently, glycopeptide-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (GISA) is difficult. Glycopeptides are an option for MRSA and VRE endocarditis, but literature suggests that response may be suboptimal.Case Report: We describe an 80 year old man who presented with MRSA mitral valve endocarditis. He was initially treated with IV vancomycin for 28 days, however the patient developed renal impairment during the last 10 days of treatment. 23 days later, he became pyrexial with a high C-reactive protein and blood cultures grew, again, MRSA. The renal function was still impaired and after a single dose of IV vancomycin, he was treated with oral rifampicin (300 mg BD) and linezolid (600 mg BD): the latter was given IV for the first 5 days and then orally for 23 days. Ten days after stopping linezolid, the CRP and serum creatinine came back to normal (after a transient deterioration during the last few days of the linezolid course).Discussion and Conclusions:There are no clinical trials comparing linezolid treatment with vancomycin or other conventional agents in patients with endocarditis, only a limited number of case reports and two case series in literature. Some animal model studies have found linezolid as effective as vancomycin in treatment of experimental endocarditis. Based on this case report and the literature review, we conclude that, whilst awaiting for medical trials to be conducted, use of linezolid in resistant gram-positive endocarditis may be considered when vancomycin has failed or is contra-indicated. Use of this agent in patients with renal failure might be especially advantageous as the dose does not need to be reduced.COMMUNITY ACQUIRED METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS PYOMYOSITIS: IS A GLYCOPEPTIDE NECESSARY IN SOME PATIENTS?

Barnes Department of Medical Microbiology and National Public Health Service, University Hospital of Wales, Heath Park, Cardiff CF14 4XW, UKObjectives: Despite community acquired pneumonia (CAP) being a common condition, aetiological diagnosis remains problematic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential role of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on whole blood in the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia in patients admitted to hospital with CAP.Methods: A real-time PCR technique using a LightCyclere (Idaho Technologies) was used to detect the pneumolysin gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae. DNA was extracted using the QIAamp w DNA Mini Kit. EDTA blood samples were collected from 62 adult patients with CAP. The specificity of the assay was determined by performing the test on 46 patients admitted with a diagnosis other than CAP. Results of PCR were compared with those of routine cultures. The relationship between illness severity and PCR results was also investigated.Results: PCR was positive in 5/62 (8%) patients with CAP. Blood culture was positive in 2/62 (3%) patients. The difference was not statistically significant \u00f0p \u00bc 0:25\u00de: PCR was positive in 5/30 (17%) cases with severe pneumonia and none of the cases with nonsevere pneumonia \u00f0p \u00bc 0:03\u00de: PCR was negative on all 46 control samples giving a specificity of 100%.Conclusion: PCR on whole blood was not sensitive enough to offer any improvement in the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia in this study. The small number of positive PCR or blood culture results may reflect a limited number of true cases of pneumococcal pneumonia in this study, and would have had low statistical power to detect a difference between the two diagnostic methods. PCR techniques using larger volumes of blood and different extraction techniques may improve the sensitivity. These results suggest however that there may be a role for PCR in the diagnosis of patients who are admitted with severe pneumonia or septicaemia in whom a definite diagnosis is not yet established.USE OF ORAL ANTIBIOTICS IN TREATMENT OF BONE AND JOINTINFECTIONS IN THE UK E.

Diagnosis is difficult if the microorganism is not isolated, possibly due to prior antibiotic therapy. The aim of this study was to develop a panel of serological tests for the diagnosis of IE caused by Gram-positive cocci.A panel of three antigen-based ELISAs to measure serum antibody levels to Gram-positive cocci was developed and applied to the diagnosis of IE. The assays were based on the detection of IgG specific to EfaA (enterococci), a Staphylococcus aureus wholecell antigen preparation, and SorA (Streptococcus oralis EfaA homologue). Each component ELISA gave the following parameters:Serum samples were collected from 111 IE patients confirmed as 'definite' or 'possible' by the Duke criteria: 48 staphylococcal IE; 37 streptococcal IE; 17 enterococcal IE, 6 patients with IE caused by \"other\" microorganisms, and 3 polymicrobial infections.The set of three serum antibody titres for each patient were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis using Pearson correlation (SPSS). Of the streptococcal patients 73% were located in cluster one and 83% of staphylococcal patients separated into cluster two.A diagnostic panel of ELISAs is independent of both endocardial imaging and microbial culture results. Neither is it affected by prior antibiotic therapy making it complementary to currently used investigations. This rapid and inexpensive assay may augment the Duke criteria for diagnosing Gram-positive coccal IE.MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS STRAINS USING PULSED-FIELD GEL ELECTROPHORESIS AND CORRELATION OF PROFILE WITH ISOLATE SOURCE J. M. Caddick 1 , A. C. Hilton 1 , P. A. Lambert 1 , T. Worthington 2 and T. S. J. Elliott 2 1 Microbiology Research, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham, 2 University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust, Birmingham, UK Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an established nosocomial pathogen with increasing reports of multipleresistant (MR) strains and more recently observations of an emerging problem within the community. The objective of this study was to investigate whether pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of Sma I macrofragments (considered the gold standard for typing), could be used to distinguish community-acquired (CA) MRSA strains from hospitalacquired (HA) MRSA strains. A total of 84 MRSA isolates were typed: 1 NCTC 8325 strain, 8 MR-HA-MRSA isolates (only sensitive to vancomycin, tetracycline and rifampicin), 20 CA-MRSA isolates from the West Midlands and 53 HA-MRSA isolates, including known EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16 strains. The profiles generated were analysed using GelCompar 4.0 with the band matching coefficient of Dice and UPGMA clustering to determine profile relatedness. Analysis indicated that 15 HA-MRSA and 6 CA-MRSA strains were indistinguishable from the EMRSA-15 genotype. In addition, 12 HA-MRSA strains and 2 CA-MRSA strains shared the EMRSA-16 genotype. Interestingly, 3 HA-MRSA and 1 CA-MRSA shared the same genotype as the 8 MR-HA-MRSA strains. The remaining CAMRSA strains shared the same genotype with 1 or more of the HA-MRSA strains excluding 5 CA-MRSA strains, which had unique profiles. Overall strain relatedness was 50% but could be sub-divided into 3 distinct groups. Group 1 consisted of 16 CA-MRSA and 24 HA-MRSA; strains were 90% related. Group 2 consisted of all 8 MR-HA-MRSA, 3 CA-MRSA and 21 HA-MRSA; strains were 86% related. Group 3 was a heterogenous group consisting of 1 CA-MRSA and 11 HAMRSA. This study suggests a correlation between the PFGE profile and isolate source which may be useful in inferring strain history. THE ROLE OF ULTRASOUND-GUIDED BIOPSY IN ABDOMINAL TUBERCULOSIS P. Koumellis 1 , A. Cope 1 , M. W. McKendrick 1 and R. J. Peck 2 Department of Infection and Tropical Medicine 1 , Department of Radiology 2 , Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield S10 2JF, UKWe present 5 cases of abdominal tuberculosis (TB) with two different means of diagnosis. Four patients were of Indian subcontinent origin and all presented with non-specific symptoms, abdominal distension and pyrexia. Two of them became very unwell and needed admission to intensive care unit. In all the cases ultrasound showed peritoneal thickening and omental cake. Two of them had chest X-ray changes in addition.Two patients had the diagnosis made on laparotomy. The first patient underwent an urgent laparotomy because of clinical deterioration. The second patient had a laparoscopy that was converted to open laparotomy. Tissue obtained from both procedures demonstrated caseating granulomas. They developed significant pain, post-surgical ileus and were starved for several days.Three patients had their diagnosis made much more easily via an ultrasound-guided biopsy. One patient, despite absence of risk factors, grew a multidrug resistant (MDR) TB. Another who had spent considerable time caring for patients with MDR-TB, was diagnosed by histology (tubercle bacilli and caseating granulomas demonstrated). Unfortunately, in this case, cultures remained negative after 8 weeks. Both of these patients had CXR changes but were unable to produce sputum spontaneously or by induced methods.This poster provides a pictorial review of abdominal imaging in tuberculosis and aims to demonstrate that US-guided biopsy may be the preferred option to consider in suspected cases of abdominal TB. It is minimally invasive, safe for the patient and when performed by an experienced operator has a good diagnostic yield.P28 REGIONAL SURVEY OF MRSA CONTAINMENT MEASURES ACROSS CRITICAL CARE UNITS M. Catchpole 1 , M. Chequers 2 and R. P. D. Cooke 1 Departments of Infection Prevention and Control 1 and Intensive Care 2 , District General Hospital, Eastbourne, East Sussex BN21 2UD, UK Introduction: Critical Care Units (CCUs) are high-risk areas for both cross-contamination and infection with MRSA. Current UK guidelines on MRSA control in hospitals were last revised in 1998.These recommend that CCUs routinely screen patients transferred from an MRSA-affected ward, undertake discharge screening and isolate known carriers if MRSA is endemic. However, in view of the increasing burden of nosocomial MRSA, these guidelines are unlikely to be fully implemented. The objective of this study was to therefore assess current MRSA control measures in CCUs to determine if present practices should influence future national recommendations.Methods: A postal questionnaire was sent to 77 CCUs in the South East Thames Region. These included intensive care/high dependency units, specialist units (e.g. neurological and burns units) and coronary care/cardiac units. In addition questionnaires were sent to 44 infection control teams within the region. Of 121 questionnaires sent, 61 (50%) were returned. The majority of respondents (80%) attempted single room or cohort isolation of MRSA patients. However, only 64 CCU single rooms were identified in the survey and 72% of respondents felt that further single rooms in their unit were required. Nevertheless, only 17% of respondents would close CCU beds if cohorting MRSA patients. 51% of respondents relied on signs or tape around a bed to highlight an MRSA patient. 67% of CCUs screened all patients on admission whilst only 20% screened on discharge. 44% of CCUs preferred to use weekly surveillance methods. 40% of CCUs would only accept a known MRSA carrier if suitable isolation facilities were available. MRSA patients routinely underwent some form of skin decontamination in 67% of CCUs.Conclusions: A consistent approach to MRSA containment is required across CCUs. Current national guidelines are probably unworkable due to limited single rooms and the endemic nature of MRSA in CCUs.THE UTILITY OF FAECAL MYCOBACTERIAL CULTURE IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS D.

M. Martin 1 , C. Bond 2 , M. Narayanan 1 and A. Galloway 1 Department of Microbiology 1 , Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne and National Collection of Yeast Cultures 2 , Institute of Food Research, Norwich, UK Objectives: Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a yeast found in many foodstuffs. It occasionally causes opportunistic infection especially in immunosuppressed patients. There is limited information on sensitivity of clinical isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to azoles especially the newer agents. We tested the sensitivity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to fluconazole, itraconazole and the new triazole, voriconazole and performed DNA fingerprinting to distinguish between strains. Methods: 17 clinical isolates of S. cerevisiae predominantly from surveillance cultures from immunosuppressed patients were collected from April 2002 to August 2003 and tested for sensitivity to fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole using Etest strips. Germ-tube negative isolates were identified using API 20C AUX. Sensitivity tests on RPMI media with 2% glucose and yeast suspensions adjusted to a turbidity of a 0.5 McFarland standard, at 35 8C was read after 48 hours. DNA fingerprinting was performed to exclude the possibility of an outbreak strain as 10/17 isolates were from the same Unit. Results The MIC to fluconazole ranged from 0.5 -24 g/ml. 16/17 isolates were sensitive to fluconazole. 1 strain showed reduced sensitivity (MIC 24 g/ml). The MIC to itraconazole ranged from 0.19 to .32 g/ml. 12 strains showed resistance (MIC .0.5) and 5 reduced sensitivity MIC 0.19 -0.5 g/ml. The MIC to voriconazole ranged from 0.006-0.125 g/ml indicating that all isolates would be sensitive to voriconazole (using the criteria, sensitive as #1 g/ml). DNA fingerprinting on 14 isolates identified 11 different strains. Conclusion: Most strains appeared to be sensitive to fluconazole but showed reduced sensitivity or resistance to itraconazole. Itraconazole prophylaxis is commonly used for prophylaxis on our Haematology Unit which may explain the high number of resistant strains. All isolates however appeared to have low MICs to voriconazole suggesting that it may be a therapeutic option for serious Saccharomyces cerevisiae infections. DNA fingerprinting is useful in distinguishing between strains. IN VITRO SUSCEPTIBILITY OF VORICONAZOLE AGAINST CANDIDA SPECIES WITH REDUCED SENSITIVITY TO FLUCONAZOLE AND ITRACONAZOLE M. Narayanan, K. M. Martin and A. Galloway Department of Microbiology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK Objectives: We tested Candida isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole and itraconazole, mainly from surveillance specimens from immunocompromised patients, for voriconazole sensitivity, a new potent triazole, to assess the potential for its use against resistant strains in our hospital. Methods: 54 clinical Candida isolates including C. glabrata (40), C. krusei (7), C. albicans (3), C. guilliermondii (3), C. dubliniensis (1) which showed reduced susceptibility to either fluconazole or itraconazole were tested for voriconazole MIC by E test. After identifying germ tube negative candida isolates by API 20 C AUX, sensitivity testing was performed on RPMI media with 2% glucose with yeast suspensions adjusted to a turbidity of a 0.5 McFarland standard. Plates were incubated at 35 8C for 48 hours. Results: Overall 51/54 (92.6%) isolates had voriconazole MIC ,2 mg/ml (MIC 90:0.5 mg/ml). For C. glabrata, 24/40 (60%) isolates were fluconazole sensitive but of decreased sensitivity to itraconazole, the voriconazole MIC range was 0.004-0.125 mg/ml. 12/40 (30%) had reduced sensitivity to both fluconazole and itraconazole and voriconazole MIC range was higher at 0.125-8.0 mg/ml. 3 out of these 12 (25%) had MIC .2 mg/ml. 4/20 (20%) in spite of high fluconazole and itraconazole MICs had low voriconazole MIC range of 0.023 -0.094 mg/ml. the other Candida isolates, voriconazole MIC ranged from 0.024-0.25 mg/ml for C. krusei, C. albicans 0.024-0.094 mg/ml, C. guilliermondii 0.032 -0.047 mg/ml and C. dubliniensis 0.032 mg/ml. Conclusions: There are no established breakpoints for voriconazole in literature, so based on putative breakpoints of MIC #1 mg/ml as sensitive and $2 mg/ml as resistant, our data suggests that voriconazole may be very useful for treating serious candida infections in our group of patients. However, it is essential to perform sensitivity testing as occasional strains e.g. C. glabrata may be resistant to voriconazole and this may not be evident by fluconazole and itraconazole sensitivity tests.

Patients, methods & results: Initially, 79 children (0-16y) undergoing LTx between 1997-98 (group I) were studied. The incidence of FI was 40% (32/79): half of these were invasive. Candida spp. were recovered in 73% of patients; 55% were Candida albicans. The following were risk factors for FI: pre LTx colonisation with fungus; ICU stay .2w; antibacterials for .3w within 2 months of LTx; steroids; retransplantation, and hepatic artery thrombosis. In this group, 48% (38/79) children were colonised by fungus pre-LTx: C. albicans in 71.5%, and Aspergillus spp. in 3%.Post-LTx the same number were colonised, but C. albicans and Aspergillus spp. were more frequent. An antifungal prophylaxis protocol was introduced between 1999 and 2000 for 93 children (group II). Fluconazole was given immediately after and for 2w post-LTx to those with risk factors (see above; 27 patients), or amphotericin B to those also colonised by Aspergillus spp. or non-C. albicans yeasts (20 patients). During this period 44% (41/93) were colonised pre-LTx: 68% by C. albicans and 5% by Aspergillus spp.; post-LTx the incidence of detectable colonisation was 16% (15/93). The incidence of FI and invasive FI in group II was 10% and 2%, respectively.",

We have recently published the first UK pharmacoeconomic (PE) analysis of the prevention of paediatric pneumococcal infection in the UK. 2Objectives: To apply the US observed decline in disease to both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia in the UK, to calculate the number of cases and deaths indirectly preventable and to reanalyse the cost per life year gained (CLYG) accordingly.Methods: Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for NationalStatistics 1999 data were used for calculating adult cases and deaths respectively. The proportions of adult 'unspecified' meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia attributable to pneumococcal infection were, respectively, 56%, 1.1% and 32%. Infants and young children (but not adults) would be vaccinated according to the SmPC for their age group.Results: For the age groups 20 -39/40 -64/65 \u00fe years, for pneumococcal meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia, there are estimated to be 177/251/162, 52/156/306 and 17466/44201/39797 cases and 8/28/31, 4/11/25 and 81/671/10090 deaths respectively, reducible by 32%/8%/18%.",

            "text": "Influenza in older people is a major cause of hospitalisation and mortality during winter months. In spite of studies which show that influenza is both safe and effective, vaccine uptake in older people still remains sub-optimal. This study aims to examine why older people often miss out on the jab.A qualitative study using in-depth interviewing with approximately 50 people aged 65 years and over was carried out in South Wales. The sample consisted of those people who regularly have the jab, those who refuse to have the jab, those who have stopped having the jab and those who have had the jab for the first time in 2001/02. Initial analysis identified three main themes. Firstly, the majority of those people interviewed did not feel at risk from flu. Secondly, potential and actual side effects of the flu jab were reasons for may patients either refusing to have a flu jab or deciding not to have it again. Thirdly, a tentative association was found between the level of patient contact with health professionals and their decision to have the jab.Clear communication of the risks of flu, particularly to healthy older people, may be an important determinant of flu vaccine uptake. Health professionals can promote immunisation both by personalising the risk of catching flu and by tackling misconceptions about side effects.",
