Recombinant complementary DNA (cDNA) representing gene 9 (the gene encoding the neutralization antigens in VP7 glycoprotein) from OSU (porcine rotavirus serotype 1 ) and Gottfried (porcine rotavirus serotype 2) strains were used to determine the optimal hybridization conditions which allow specific detection of group A porcine rotaviruses. Probes were prepared by excision of the inserts from the recombinant plasmids and radiolabeling of cDNA with 32p by the random primer extension method. Probes were hybridized at various stringencies with viral RNA from different rotavirus serotypes bound to nylon membranes. Hybridization at low stringency (26% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) had high sensitivity but low specificity. Hybridization at high stringency ( 16% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) produced high specificity but decreased the sensitivity observed at low stringency. Probes were specific for rotavirus at both stringencies and did not hybridize with nucleic acids from other porcine viruses. Subgenomic gene 9 fragments were then tested to provide more specific probes. A 322 bp fragment from OSU gene 9 between nucleotides 382 and 704 and a 266 bp fragment from Gottfried gene 9 between nucleotides 230 and 496 were found to be specific as hybridization probes. These studies demonstrated the feasibility of the dot blot hybridization assay using subgenomic fragments of gene 9 to detect and differentiate serotypes of porcine rotavirus. Additional studies are warranted to further evaluate the sensitivity and the capability of these probes to detect porcine field isolates of the same serotype.",

Rotaviruses have been grouped into five antigenically distinct groups (A to E) with group A probably being the most prevalent (Pedley et al., 1986) . Group A rotaviruses share a common group antigen (Woode et al., 1976) on protein VP6, an inner capsid protein (Greenberg et al., 1983b) . Group A rotaviruses have been further classified into two subgroups (I and II) based on the subgroup antigen also located on VP6 (Greenberg et al., 1983b; Estes et al., 1983) . The majority of animal rotaviruses possess the subgroup I antigen while the majority of human rotaviruses have the subgroup II antigen (Hoshino et al., 1984) . Porcine group A rotavirus strain OSU has a subgroup I antigen and the Gottfried strain of group A rotavirus has a subgroup II antigen (Hoshino et al., 1984) . Neutralization antigens VP4, formerly VP3 (Liu et al., 1988 ) , and VP7 are associated with the outer capsid of rotavirions (Greenberg et al., 1983c) .",

The group A rotavirus common and subgroup antigens on VP6 are coded for in gene segment 6 (Estes et al., 1983; Greenberg et al., 1983a) . Neutralization antigens of VP4 and VP7 are encoded by gene segments 4 and either 8 or 9, respectively (Kalica et al., 1981; Greenberg et al., 1983a) . At least seven serotypes of group A rotaviruses have been reported in accordance with the unified scheme of serotyping rotaviruses from animals and man (Hoshino et al., 1984) . In swine, two serotypes of group A rotaviruses have been recognized (Bohl et al., 1984) . OSU and Gottfried strains have been designated as the prototype strains for porcine rotavirus serotypes 1 and 2 (Bohl et al., 1984) . According to the unified serotyping scheme established for rotaviruses occurring in animals and man, OSU has been classified as serotype 5 and Gottfried as serotype 4. Recently, two new strains of porcine rotavirus were isolated in Iowa (Paul et al., 1988a) . These new strains, designed ISU-64 and ISU-65, were shown by neutralization tests to be new porcine rotavirus serotypes. Two additional rotavirus serotypes have been reported in Mexico (Ruiz et al., 1988) and Australia (Nagesha and Holmes, 1988 ) .",

Serotyping of rotaviruses has been traditionally done by tissue culture isolation followed by plaque reduction neutralization (Hoshino et al., 1984) or fluorescent focus inhibition assays that use hyperimmune antisera to each of the rotavirus serotypes (Woode et al., 1983 ) . Recently, several groups of investigators have developed serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies for use in ELISA for serotyping of rotavirus field isolates (Shaw et al., 1985; Coulsen et al., 1987; Taniguchi et al., 1987) . While this approach appears promising, studies have shown that monoclonal antibody based ELISA may not detect all rotavirus isolates belonging to the same serotype (Coulson et al., 1987; Taniguchi et al., 1987 ) . As an alternative, nucleic acid hybridization procedures for detection ofrotavirus have been used (Pedley and McGrae, 1984; Lin et al., 1987) . Similar techniques for differentiating rotavirus serotypes in humans using recombinant cDNA hybridization probes specific for gene segment 9 were demonstrated by Dimitrov et al. (1985) and Lin et al. (1987) . In the present study, a dot blot hybridization assay is described for the detection and serotypic differentiation of porcine rotavirus utilizing hybridization probes prepared from recombinant cDNA representing gene 9 from OSU and Gottfried strains (porcine rotavirus serotypes 1 and 2, respectively).",

The stringency was adjusted by changing the temperature of hybridization, varying the salt concentration, and by the addition of different amounts of formamide. Increasing the temperature of the hybridization minimizes interaction of the probe with partially homologous sequences. As the salt concentration increases, the rate of hybridization increases. Conversely, the rate of hybridization decreases as formamide concentration increases. Formamide acts to lower melting temperature (Tm), the temperature at which nucleic acids are 50% denatured. Therefore, low temperatures (37-42 \u00b0 C) are usually used with high salt concentration (4 \u00d7 to 5 \u00d7 SSC) with the inclusion of 50% formamide. Hybridization performed at high temperatures ( 52 to 65 o C ) require low salt concentration (0.5 X to 2.5 \u00d7 SSC ) and may include formamide. Initial studies utilized the conditions reported by Dimitrov et al. (1985 ) . Membranes with the immobilized nucleic acids were prehybridized in heat sealed plastic bags for 2 h at either 42 \u00b0 C or 56 \u00b0 C. For some membranes, prehybridization was carried out at 56\u00b0C with 13% formamide. For all membranes, the prehybridization solution consisted of 6xSSC, 4XDenhardt's solution (1\u00d7Denhardt's=0.02% each of bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and Ficoll), 100 mM Tris (pH 7.5 ), 2 mM EDTA, 0.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 200 ~tg/ml of sonicated, denatured salmon testes DNA (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO).

Additional studies were performed utilizing a different set of stringency conditions.

Moderate reactivity was also observed with RNA from porcine field isolates 7325, 6167R, 6418, and new porcine rotavirus serotype ISU-64. The diminished signal with these samples indicates a reduction in the homology of the nucleotide sequence of gene 9 from that with OSU. These differences were further amplified under conditions of high stringency (16% bp mismatch). Rotaviruses 7360, 10986, 7325, 6167R and 6418 have been serotyped as porcine rotavirus serotype 1. Hybridization of the OSU gene 9 at high stringency was only indicated in those samples with the strongest signal at low stringency (Fig. 3B) . These included field isolates 7360, 10986, the gnotobiotic fecal sample, and, of course, homologous OSU RNA.

Field isolates 7325, 6167R, and 6418 did not react with the OSU probe under these conditions.

            "text": "Epidemiological studies to determine the prevalence and distribution of porcine rotaviruses have been hampered by the lack of suitable assays capable of both detection and differentiation of porcine rotavirus serotypes. Due to the involvement of two viral proteins, VP4, formerly VP3 (Liu et al., 1988) , and VP7 in stimulating neutralizing antibodies, results from traditional methods can be ambiguous . Recently, a number of groups have developed VPT-serotype specific monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to be used with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the determination of human rotavirus serotypes (Coulson et al., 1987; Taniguchi et al., 1987 ) . Although sensitive and efficient, these methods do have their limitations. Coulson et al. ( 1987 ) reported that rotavirus from some human stool specimens did not react with their specific MAb but did react with other MAbs to the same serotype. This non-reactivity of serotype-specific MAbs may have been caused by small base changes in the nucleotide sequence that codes for the neutralization epitopes within the VP7 gene (Dyall-Smith et al., 1986; Green et al., 1987) or possibly by changes in the proximity of the neutralization epitopes present in the protein's native form versus that of the linear molecule (Green et al., 1987; Morita et al., 1988) . In another study, Taniguchi et al., (1987) reported the inability of a serotype-specific MAb based ELISA to determine the rotavirus serotype of 33% of infected human stool samples, possibly due to intraserotype antigenic variation. Dot blot hybridization assays have been utilized by a number of groups both for the detection of human rotavirus in clinical samples (Flores et al., 1983; Pedley and Mc-Crae, 1984) and for the detection and characterization of enteric coronavirus infection of baby pigs (Shockley et al., 1987 ) . Additional studies have been reported in which improved cDNA probes of gene-specific segments of the rotavirus genome were used to characterize human rotavirus by subgroup and serotype (Dimitrov et al., 1985; Lin et al., 1987; Flores et al., 1989) .",

            "text": "Our initial studies used stringency conditions reported by Dimitrov et al. ( 1985 ) in which serotyping of rotaviruses was achieved with the use of cloned cDNA of gene 6 (which codes for the subgroup antigen) and gene 9 (which codes for the neutralization antigen). They reported that rotavirus serotypes 2 and 3 could be differentiated with the gene 9 cDNA probe by using conditions of low stringency (56 \u00b0 C), and comparison with the results obtained with hybridization at 56\u00b0C, 13% formamide. In addition, a further increase in the stringency conditions to 65 \u00b0 C, 7% formamide allowed differentiation of serotypes 1 and 4 from serotype 3. Based on the equation Tm (DNA-RNA)=79.8+I8.5 log (Na+)+58.4 (%G+C)+ll.8 (%G+C)2-820/ #bp in duplex-0.5 (% formamide) (Wahl et al., 1987) where (G+C) was given a value of 0.43 (Flores et al., 1986 ) , the base pair mismatch allowed for the formation of stable hybrids was 33% at low stringency and 24% at high stringency. However, Green et al. ( 1987 ) reported 15-29% divergence in the amino acid sequences of the VP7 proteins of several different human rotavirus serotypes and 91 to 99% homology among rotaviruses of the same serotype. In addition, 74% nucleotide identity between OSU and Gottfried strains has been reported indicating that the conditions of stringency would have to be increased to differentiate porcine rotavirus serotypes 1 and 2. The conditions of stringency used by Flores et al. ( 1986 ) were found to be suitable for our hybridization assay. Under low stringency (42 \u00b0 C, 5 x SSC, 50% formamide) the calculated base pair mismatch was 26%. As expected, under these conditions some reactivity was observed with the cDNA probes and heterologous RNA. Under these conditions, however, a sensitivity level of at least 1 ng was achieved with RNA from homologous rotavirus. In addition, RNA from isolates 7360 and 7325 from Iowa and 6167R, 6418, and 10986 from Missouri, all typed as porcine rotavirus serotype 1, could be identified with the OSU probe (Fig. 3A) . Reactivity was also observed with RNA from ISU-64, recently reported to be a new serotype of porcine rotavirus. Similar reactivity of ISU-64 with the Gottfried probe was observed (Fig.  4) . These data indicate that ISU-64 gene 9 may have higher homology with OSU and Gottfried than that observed with OSU or Gottfried with other rotavirus serotypes. Use of this new porcine serotype is suggested for the assessment of the specificity of OSU and Gottfried probes in the detection of porcine rotavirus serotypes. Under conditions of high stringency (52\u00b0C, 2.5 X SSC, 50% formamide) the allowable base pair mismatch for the formation of stable hybrids was reduced to 16%. Under these conditions, a high level of specificity was achieved as indicated by the elimination of reactivity with heterologous RNA. However, these conditions decreased the level of sensitivity for homologous RNA from 1 ng at low stringency to only 10 ng (Fig. 3B ). In addition, the reactivity of isolates 7360 and 10986 was greatly reduced and the reactivity with isolates 7325, 6167R, and 6418 was eliminated (Fig. 3B) . These results indicate sufficient diversity may exist within the VP7 gene among rotaviruses of the same serotype that, at conditions of high stringency, they may not be identified.",

            "text": "Results obtained with different stringencies indicated sensitivity was higher at low stringency but specificity was lower. Based on these observations, we concluded that probes prepared from selected regions ofgene 9 that are serotype specific and hybridized to rotavirus RNA under low stringency conditions may provide the specificity and sensitivity achieved at two different stringencies. Recently, several groups have determined the nucleotide sequence of the VP7 gene of more than 35 rotavirus strains. Comparison of their deduced amino acid sequences have revealed six discrete divergent regions (A to F) among different serotypes (Green et al., 1987; Green et al., 1988) : amino acids 39-50 (region A), 87-101 (region B), 120-130 (region C), 143-152 (region D), 208-221 (region E), and 233-242 (region F). A comparison of these same regions among rotaviruses belonging to the same serotype revealed 91-99% homology (Green et al., 1987 ) . Furthermore, Dyall-Smith et al. (1986) identified three regions corresponding to regions B, D, and E as the antigenic sites involved in serotype-specific neutralization. Based on these reports, serotype-specific probes were prepared from nucleotide sequences corresponding to some of the previously described regions. The 322 bp subfragment from OSU gene 9 (fragment E) lies between bases 382 and 704 (Fig. 5A ) and encompasses coding regions corresponding to region C-F. The 266 bp subfragment from Gottfried gene 9 (fragment J) lies between bases 230 and 496 (Fig. 5B ) and encompasses coding regions corresponding to regions B-D. Under low strongency conditions (42 \u00b0 C, 5 X SSC, 50% formamide ) the probes were highly specific for RNA from homologous serotypes. These results showed that subfragments from the middle ofgene 9 from both OSU (subfragment E) and Gottfried (subfragments I and J ) were most specific for homologous rotavirus RNA. Sequences within these subfragments contained more divergent regions among rotavirus serotypes than the other subfragments. Surprisingly, subfragment G of Gottfried gene 9 was less specific than subfragment J although both subfragments were nearly identical in size and location within gene 9. Possible contamination of subfragment G with subfragment H could have occurred with excission of subfragment G from the agarose gel. These two subfragments are nearly identical in size (subfragment G was 287 bp and subfragment H was 229 bp) and subfragment H may have a large percentage of conserved sequences among rotavirus serotypes. However, this problem can be avoided in future studies by amplification of serotype-specific regions by polymerase chain reaction technology.",

Specific regions of DNA can now be amplified using synthetic oligonucleotides by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and used as probes. Additionally, the use of nonradioactive labeled probes would eliminate the costly, cumbersome, and time consuming method of radioactive labeling. Recently, an enzyme-labeled oligonucleotide probe was developed to detect human rotavirus RNA in clinical samples using a dot blot hybridization assay (Olive and Sethi, 1989 ) .
