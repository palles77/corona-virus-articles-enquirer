In a small-scale experimental trial, involving 21 pregnant cows (13 vaccinated and eight unvaccinated controls), a significant increase in neutralizing antibody titres against different serotypes of bovine rotaviruses was found in both the colostrum and serum of vaccinated cows compared with that of anvaccinated controls. Seven days after birth, half of the calves born to vaccinated dams or to control cows were challenged with live virulent virus whereas the other half of both groups were left in contact with the infected calves in order to mimic a natural field challenge. Although no statistically significant differences in the rate of protection were observed among the different groups of animals, a larger number of vaccinated calves were protected in comparison with their controls, particularly where animals in contact with infected calves were concerned. Secondly, a large-scale field trial was carried out in 17 beef herds involving a total of 4066 vaccinated pregnant cows. In 11 farms morbidity and mortality in calves from vaccinated cows were compared with historical data from the previous 3 years at the same locations. In the other six herds, control groups were used to compare data of the same year: 1540 cows were vaccinated and 2700 were left as controls. Taking into account the previous and current incidence of diarrhoea, morbidity and mortality were significantly reduced in 16 of the 17 beef herds tested.",

To be effective, these vaccines must be designed rationally and based on the impact that the different enteropathogens have in a definite geographical region; therefore single agents or appropriate combinations of them should be components of these vaccines. Other relevant factors in achieving effective vaccination are the type of vaccine (live attenuated or inactivated virus) the formulation, and the route and timing of immunization(s). Calves can be protected against rotavirus and enterotoxigenic E. coil by passive immunization, taking advantage of the lactogenic immunity stimulated by maternal vaccination or directly by feeding calves with hyperimmune colostrum obtained from vaccinated dams 6'7. In contrast, attempts to stimulate active immunity in newborn calves by oral vaccination with live attenuated virus have been unsuccessful so far 8'9 . With regard to the formulation of the vaccine, the most relevant factor is which type of adjuvant to use. When the target for vaccination is the pregnant cow, it has been demonstrated that oil-based adjuvants are more effective than alhydrogel to enhance colostrum and milk antibody titres, at least against E. coli, rotavirus and coronavirus 1\u00b0, 11. In Argentina, neonatal diarrhoea is responsible for important economic losses in beef and dairy herds; morbidity can reach 90-100% whereas mortality ranges between 1% and 20%. Rotavirus is the major agent associated with diarrhoeal problems in Argentinian beef herds 12. For that reason, after several years of epidemiological studies, it was decided to develop and test an inactivated oil-adjuvanted vaccine with the aim of controlling diarrhoea in beef and dairy herds in Argentina.",

No significant differences were detected in the incidence of diarrhoea and mortality in the contemporary control Vaccine, Vol. 7, June 1989 265 aln farms A-F, data relating to the incidence of diarrhoea and mortality in calves born from vaccinated cows were compared with data obtained from an unvaccinated control group as well as with data from the last 3 years at the same farms. In two farms (E and F), controls were mixed (M) with vaccinated animals; in the other four farms (A-D), control animals were separated (S) from the vaccinated areas. In farms C_,-q =, data were compared only with the data of the last 3 years at the same farms; bmean of the last 3 years; Centeropathogens detected the year before vaccination: R, rotavirus; Co, coronavirus; Cr, cryptosporidium; aS, controls kept apart from vaccinated animals; M, control and vaccinated animals kept in close proximity groups (35.7 and 4.7% respectively) when compared with the data of the last 3 years (45 and 5.4% respectively) suggesting that, in general, the epidemiological situation did not change significantly in those herds. Thus (apart from herd F which showed a low previous incidence of diarrhoea and mortality), vaccination of the cows led to an important reduction in the incidence of diarrhoea and mortality (9.2 and 0.3%, respectively). In four herds (A-D), vaccinated and control animals were kept apart and in the other two (E, F), controls were mixed with vaccinated animals. In one case (see Table 4 , herd F) the incidence of diarrhoea and mortality in the control group was lower than that previously recorded. However, in the other herd kept under similar conditions (Table 4 , herd E) the values for the control group were similar to the mean of the last 3 years. Thus it is not possible from these results, to reach any conclusions about the effect of maintaining vaccinated animals together with, or separated from, non-vaccinated animals.",

An interesting observation was the finding that all four uninoculated control calves were actively excreting rotavirus, indicating that the natural exposure used in this experiment was a valid method of challenge. This finding is important because the dose of challenge virus used in a direct inoculation probably would not be representative of the field conditions in which spontaneous infections are continuously occurring. In this regard, difficulties (overwhelming or inadequate doses of virus) in evaluation of the efficacy of immunization by direct inoculation of calves, have been reported 6,7.",

Nine of the 17 herds studied were sampled the year before the trial and, besides rotavirus, coronavirus and/or cryptosporidium were detected; in three of those herds the same enteropathogens that had been found the year before were detected again at the moment of the trial (see Results) , suggesting that there were no significant changes in the epidemiological situation at the trial locations. This observation is relevant because the vaccine was equally effective in herds where rotavirus alone, or where rotavirus and the other two enteropathogens, were present. These results are in contradiction to those reported by Snodgrass 6 who found that, in two herds in which rotavirus was associated with cryptosporidium, rotavirus vaccination was effective in diminishing the excretion of rotavirus but not in controlling diarrhoea. The reason(s) for such discrepancy are at present obscure and further work with a larger number of herds and animals is necessary to elucidate this problem. However,judging by the results obtained in this work, it is tempting to speculate that under the particular conditions of cattle breeding in our country, rotaviruses could be the agents that play a major part in determining diarrhoea in newborn calves. In this regard, it is likely that biological, nutritional, environmental or management factors could influence the persistence of a given pathogen in the field, or could well influence the degree of pathogenicity of a given infectious agent or different combinations of agents 6.",
