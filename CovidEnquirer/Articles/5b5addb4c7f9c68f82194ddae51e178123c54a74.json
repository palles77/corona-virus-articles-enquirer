Atrophy is caused by accelerated loss of enterocytes or decreased production of enterocytes by stem cells in the crypts. Stem cells retain the ability to reconstitute the overlying mucosa, but regeneration may take days to weeks depending upon the pathologic process. Viral infections (e.g., parvovirus, coronavirus, rotavirus) are the most important causes of damage to villus enterocytes in dogs and cats. Viral enteritides are usually acute, selflimiting infections that resolve over a matter of a few days to 1 to 2 weeks. Villous atrophy may result from immune-mediated processes such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy in the Irish Setter dog, 3 or as a consequence of food sensitivity reactions in both dogs and cats. 4 Food sensitivity reactions are increasingly recognized as an important cause of villous atrophy, malassimilation, and diarrhea in companion animals. Immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids, vincristine, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide) may also cause severe villous atrophy. Glucocorticoids are frequently prescribed in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Antiinflammatory doses of glucocorticoids appear to have minimal effect on epithelial cell turnover, but immunosuppressive doses may abolish epithelial cell renewal. These effects are usually reversible with discontinuation of therapy.",

In the absence of pancreatic enzyme secretion, undigested protein, lipid, or carbohydrate cannot be further absorbed. Affected animals develop diarrhea, steatorrhea, and severe protein-calorie malnutrition. These same animals develop SIBO, gastric acidinduced injury to the intestinal mucosa, cobalamin malabsorption, and hypersecretion of fluid and electrolytes. It is for these reasons that pancreatic insufficient animals may have incomplete response with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Bacterial infection is another example of a diarrheal disorder with multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms. The heat-stable enterotoxin of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli stimulates guanylate cyclase production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinases, culminating in secretory-type diarrhea. At the same time, platelet-activating factor, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes produced during bacterial infection may contribute to the malabsorption and disordered motility of E. coli infections. 18 L. rhamnosus GG has been safely colonized in the canine gastrointestinal tract, although probiotic effects in the canine intestine have not been firmly established. 19 The probiotic organism, Enterococcus faecium (SF68), has been safely colonized in the canine gastrointestinal tract, and it has been shown to increase fecal immunoglobulin A content and circulating mature B (CD21 + / major histocompatibility complex class II + ) cells in young puppies. 20 It has been suggested that this probiotic may be useful in the prevention or treatment of canine gastrointestinal disease. This organism may, however, enhance Campylobacter jejuni adhesion and colonization of the dog intestine, perhaps conferring carrier status on colonized dogs. 21 Lactobacillus acidophilus has also been shown to safely colonize the canine gastrointestinal tract.",

            "text": "The major physiologic functions of the small intestine are luminal and brush-border digestion, secretion, and absorption (see Chapter 1). Other physiologic properties of the small intestine, for example, motility and blood flow, have evolved to regulate digestion, secretion, and absorption. The anatomic structures in support of these functions include the serosa, longitudinal smooth muscle, myenteric or Auerbach's plexus, circular smooth muscle, submucosal or Meissner's plexus, muscularis mucosa, and mucosa. Epithelial cells in the intestinal mucosa are specialized primarily for membrane brush-border enzymatic (e.g., disaccharidases, peptidases) digestion, fluid and electrolyte secretion, and absorption. The crypt is the germinal center of the intestinal epithelium. Crypt epithelial cells are primarily secretory in function-water, solutes, and bicarbonate are secreted into the intestinal lumen to solubilize the chyme, neutralize gastric acid, and reduce the bacterial microflora. As cells migrate up the intestinal villi, they mature into absorptive cells. Villus epithelial cells are primarily absorptive in function-water, solutes, glucose and other monosaccharides; amino acids and small peptides; free fatty acids and glycerol; minerals and vitamins; and other nutrients are absorbed from the lumen into villus epithelial cells. Submucosal plexus neurons innervate the overlying mucosa and regulate absorption and secretion by the villus and crypt epithelial cells, respectively. Myenteric plexus neurons innervate the longitudinal and circular smooth muscle layers and regulate intestinal motility. Contraction of longitudinal smooth muscle stimulates peristaltic type activity and net fluid transit, while contraction of circular smooth muscle mediates segmentation type activity and delay in fluid transit. In health, villus epithelial cells actively absorb Na + and Cl \u2212 , and passively absorb H 2 O (see Fig. 1-17) . In malabsorptive disorders, Na + , Cl \u2212 , and H 2 O absorption are often markedly reduced in villus epithelial cells. Absorption may be inhibited through a number of mechanisms, including the effects of prostaglandins (e.g., prostaglandin E 2 ), leukotrienes, cyclic nucleotides (cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cGMP), serotonergic (serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor activation. Stimulation of absorption by these cells, on the other hand, is mediated by noradrenergic (norepinephrine) and opioid (\u00b5,\u03b4-opioid) receptor activation. The pathophysiology of malabsorptive disorders serves as the basis for medical therapy such as prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, \u00b5,\u03b4-opioid agonists, serotonergic antagonists, and noradrenergic agonists (see Fig. 1-17) .",

The authors concluded that adverse reactions to dietary staples are common in cats with chronic gastrointestinal problems and that they can be successfully managed by feeding selectedprotein diets. Further support for this concept comes from studies in which gastroenterologic or dermatologic clinical signs were significantly improved by the feeding of novel proteins.",

Anecdotal reports pharmacology of the secretory crypt cell is remarkably similar to that of the absorptive villus cell. Thus, crypt epithelial cell secretion may be stimulated by prostaglandins (e.g., prostaglandin E 2 ), leukotrienes, cyclic nucleotides (cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cGMP), serotonergic (serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor activation (see Fig. 1-17 ). Inhibition of secretion by these cells, on the other hand, is mediated by noradrenergic (norepinephrine) and opioid (\u00b5,\u03b4-opioid) receptor activation. The pathophysiology of hypersecretory disorders serves as the basis for medical therapy, for example, prostaglandin synthetase inhibition, serotonergic receptor antagonism, noradrenergic receptor agonism, and \u00b5,\u03b4-opioid receptor agonism (see Fig. 1-17) .",

Following oral dosing, most of the sulfasalazine is transported to the distal gastrointestinal tract where cecal and colonic bacteria meta bolize the drug to its component parts. Sulfapyridine is largely absorbed by the colonic mucosa, but much of the 5-aminosalicylate remains in the colonic lumen where it inhibits mucosal lipoxygenase and the inflammatory cascade. Sulfasalazine has been recommended for the treatment of canine large bowel IBD at doses of 10 to 30 mg/kg PO q8-12h for 4 to 6 weeks. With resolution of clinical signs, sulfasalazine dosages are gradually decreased by 25% at 2-week intervals and eventually discontinued while maintaining dietary management. Salicylates are readily absorbed and induce toxicity in cats, therefore this drug classification should be used with great caution in cats. 22 If used in cats, some authors have recommended using half of the recommended dog dose (i.e., 10 to 30 mg/kg PO q8-24h). Sulfasalazine usage has been associated with the development of keratoconjunctivitis sicca in the dog, so tear production should be assessed subjectively (by the pet owner) and objectively (by the veterinarian) during usage. 23, 24 Other 5-Aminosalicylates This drug classification was developed to reduce the toxicity of the sulfapyridine portion of the parent molecule (sulfasalazine) and to enhance the efficacy of the 5-aminosalicylate.
