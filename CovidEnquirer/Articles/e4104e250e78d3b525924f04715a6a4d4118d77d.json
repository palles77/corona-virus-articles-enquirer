The FCoV virion is mainly composed of nucleocapsid (N), envelope, membrane, and peplomer spike (S) proteins (Motokawa et al., 1996) . FCoV has been classified into types I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its S protein (Motokawa et al., 1995) . Type II FCoV was previously suggested to be from recombination between type I FCoV and type II canine coronavirus (CCoV) (Herrewegh et al., 1998; Terada et al., 2014) . Separate from these genotypes/serotypes, FCoV consists of two biotypes: low pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV: lowvirulent FCoV) and high pathogenic FIP virus (FIPV: virulent FCoV) (Pedersen, 2014) . FIPV can cause immune-mediated inflammatory disease with high mortality in domestic and wild felidae. Although antiviral drugs and vaccines against FIP have been investigated, no method has yet been established for practical use.",

However, a few studies on type I FCoV have been performed because of its low replication ability in feline cell lines. We previously reported that type I FCoV is closely associated with cholesterol throughout the viral life cycle (Takano et al., 2016) . We also confirmed that an increase in plasma membrane cholesterol enhances type I FCoV infection. These findings suggest that cell membrane cholesterol plays an important role in type I FCoV infection.",

Recent studies have shown that intracellular cholesterol synthesis and transport inhibitors potently reduced viral replication. For example, human hepatitis virus C (HCV) RNA replication is disrupted by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Honda and Matsuzaki, 2011) , and cholesterol transporter inhibitors inhibit replication of Ebola virus (Carette et al., 2011) .

We investigated changes in the cellular cholesterol content of U18666A-treated fcwf-4 cells. U18666A caused accumulation of cholesterol as measured by filipin III staining (Fig. 1B) . To determine whether U18666A affected the cellular cholesterol content, the level of cholesterol in fcwf-4 cells was measured. Although the level of cellular cholesterol significantly decreased in 10 mM MbCD-treated cells, neither 2 mM nor 10 mM U18666A decreased cellular cholesterol levels (Fig. 1C) . In order to confirm the effects of the accumulation of cholesterol on FCoV infection, fcwf-4 cells were pretreated with U18666A, followed by virus inoculation.

Based on this, we assumed that inhibition of type I FCoV replication by U18666A is associated with reduction of NPC1 function, and investigated whether HDACi, which improves reduced NPC1 function, resolves U18666A-induced cholesterol accumulation and inhibition of type I FCoV replication.

The N protein levels of FCoV-I KU-2 specifically decreased in fcwf-4 cells pretreated with U18666A.

However, the influence of the intracellular synthesis and transport systems of cholesterol has not been investigated. U18666A suppresses cholesterol biosynthesis and the function of cholesterol transporter NPC1. In this study, we investigated anti-FCoV activity of U18666A. U18666A induced intracellular cholesterol accumulation and strongly inhibited type I FCoV replication. In addition, treatment of cells with U18666A did not influence the cellular cholesterol level, suggesting that U18666A inhibits type I FCoV replication at a concentration suppressing cholesterol transporter but not influencing the synthesis system. In contrast to type I FCoV, no inhibitory effects of U18666A on type II FCoV replication were noted. We previously reported that type I FCoV infection is dependent on plasma membrane cholesterol, but type II FCoV does not (Takano et al., 2016) . Our findings of the present and previous studies suggest that type I FCoV requires cholesterol to infect cells, but type II FCoV does not require cholesterol for its infection.",

In FCoV-II 79-1146, the genomic region from ORF1b, ORF2 (encoding S protein), and ORF3c is derived from type II CCoV and the other regions are derived from type I FCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1998) , suggesting that these genes are factors leading to differences in the virological properties between the FCoV serotypes. Of these genes, the homology of the ORF2 gene sequence between the serotypes is low similarity (45%) (Motokawa et al., 1996) , suggesting that ORF2 is involved in the difference effects of U18666A between type I and II FCoV. S protein (encoded by ORF2) is an important protein for binding to the virus receptor and cell entry (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) . The physical properties of S protein are markedly different between types I and II FCoV. For example, type II FCoV S protein binds to the virus receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN), but type I FCoV S protein does not bind to APN (Hohdatsu et al., 1998) . In addition, type I FCoV S protein binds to heparin, but type II FCoV S protein does not (de Haan et al., 2008) . The differences in these S protein properties between the serotypes may also influence the differences in the effects of U18666A. To demonstrate this assumption, it is necessary to prepare a recombinant FCoV containing the type I FCoV ORF2 gene replacing the type II FCoV ORF2 gene. Confirmation of the influence of U18666A on replication of the recombinant FCoV is expected.",

The duration of exposure to U18666A required for inhibiting type I FCoV replication was mostly consistent with that required for cholesterol accumulation in cells, strongly suggesting that when the cholesterol transporter is inhibited, type I FCoV replication is also inhibited. HCV replication is inhibited by U18666A. It has been reported that replicated virions were not released from endosomes when HCV-replicating cells were treated with U18666A for 16 h, i.e., HCV virions were accumulated with cholesterol in late endosomes (Elgner et al., 2016) . Probably, type I FCoV replication is also inhibited by accumulation in late endosomes.",

To verify this hypothesis, we investigated the influence of HDACi on the type I FCoV replication-inhibitory effects of U18666A. In contrast to U18666A, HDACi reverts NPC1 dysfunction (Pipalia et al., 2017) . When the Vorinostat was added to U18666A-treated cells, intracellular cholesterol accumulation disappeared and type I FCoV replicability resumed. To our knowledge, reversion of U18666Ainduced inhibition of virus replication by HDACi has not previously been reported. It is necessary to determine whether the same phenomenon is observed in Ebolavirus, dengue virus, and HCV.",
