A label-free and multiplex biosensor based on imaging ellipsometry (BIE) had been developed for the detection of phage M13KO7. The surface of silicon wafer is modified with aldehyde, and proteins can be patterned homogeneously and simultaneously on the surface of silicon wafer in an array format by a microfluidic system. Avidin is immobilized on the surface for biotin-anti-M13 immobilization by means of interaction between avidin and biotin, which will serve as ligand against phage M13KO7. Phages M13KO7 are specifically captured by the ligand when phage M13KO7 solution passes over the surface, resulting in a significant increase of mass surface concentration of the anti-M13 binding phage M13KO7 layer, which could be detected by imaging ellipsometry with a sensitivity of 10 9 pfu/ml. Moreover, atomic force microscopy is also used to confirm the fact that phage M13KO7 has been directly captured by ligands on the surface. It indicates that BIE is competent for direct detection of phage M13KO7 and has potential in the field of virus detection.",

            "text": "Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to early recognition of epidemic diseases, environmental contamination or viral bioterrorist attack. Rapid detection and identification of pathogens are critically important not only to minimize transfer and spread of disease but also to devise and evaluate effective treatment strategies. The standard laboratory diagnostic test for viruses is based on their culture (Henderson et al., 1999) , which is very sensitive but cumbersome and time-consuming. Labeling methods such as fluorescent technique, electrochemiluminescence and immunosorbent assays occasionally results in false positives or a high percentage of false negatives (Long et al., 2004; Wang and Jin, 2004; Wu et al., 2004) . Label-free methods such as quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), magnetic bead cell sorting, atomic force microscope (AFM), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) are advantageous in that the detection protocols are simplified through removing the need to label secondary antibodies (Bisoffi et al., 2008; Nettikadan et al., 2003; Oh et al., 2003; Poon et al., 2004; Porter and Pickup, 1998; Uttenthaler et al., 2001) . However, some of them need expensive equipment, associated specialist skills and complicated sample preparation process. For example, AFM and PCR needs relatively expensive equipment and associated specialist skills to perform the analysis. SPR is confined to goldthiols self-assembly in the analysis. In order to avoid the problems, there is an urgent need for rapid and sensitive testing, multiplex and simple operation for virus detection.",

The incident wave of polarized light irradiates the sample as probe beam and is thereby modified, which makes the reflective or transmission beam carry sample information, such as protein layer thickness. When imaging ellipsometry is used to detect layer thickness, the reflection intensity is represented by gray-scale. Variation of layer thickness leads to change of gray-scale value. Suppose the refractive index is invariant, the gray-scale value is directly proportional to the square of the protein layer thickness in the range of 0-30 nm layer thickness, i.e. I = kd 2 , where I is the light intensity and d is the layer thickness (Arwin et al., 1993) . Under the same conditions for protein and ellipsometry, k is constant and can be determined from a protein layer with known gray-scale and known thickness (Arwin et al., 1993) . On the other hand, there is a relation between surface concentration and film thickness: surface concentration Average value in gray-scale of the image \"A\". Antibody GP3 was immobilized on areas \"a, b, c\", area \"a\" was GP3 layer as a control, area \"b\" and \"c\" was used to detect the first and second batches of phage, respectively.",

The variation of BIE signal was arising from a large amount of filamentous phage captured by bio-GP3 (Fig. 5C ) rather than the sparse contaminants.

These methods have key significance in applying BIE to disease diagnosis, as well as serving as an earlier and biologic explanation of viruses, e.g. the detection of H5N1 avian influenza virus with BIE was reported recently (Qi et al., 2007) .

First, multiple detections of numerous samples can be carried out simultaneously by antibody microarray, in other words, an obvious advantage of BIE is its capability to realize parallel analysis, e.g. different batches of purified or natural samples and series of samples prepared by serial dilution could be designed and detected on a single silicon wafer. Second, an important and novel finding of the present study is BIE's ability to detect the whole virus without label, not part of it. AFM has been used to obtain high-resolution images of viruses immobilized on substrates with sensitivity 10 8 pfu/ml (Ji et al., 1998; Kuznetsov et al., 2001) , indicating that AFM is competent for scanning and distinguishing positive and negative areas on the substrate of biosensor. Our experiment shows that the whole phage M13KO7 is captured by the sensing surface and the finding of long phage fil- The result of BIE: antibody GP3 was immobilized and formed four areas \"a1, a2, b1, b2\", among which \"b1, b2\" were adopted to detect phage sample. After BIE detection, the chip is submitted to AFM for scanning: (B) AFM image of scanning under 500 nm on the area containing antibody GP3; (C) AFM image of scanning under 5 m on the area dedicated for phage detection. ament is in agreement with previous studies, validating the present results of virus detection. However, some limitation of BIE is also noticeable, in particular, the sensitivity of BIE is still at a low level (10 9 pfu/ml) compared with the sensitivity (10 8 pfu/ml) of AFM and QCM (Nettikadan et al., 2003; Uttenthaler et al., 2001) , and thus further improvement in its sensitivity is needed. Another limitation of BIE diagnosis is that it could not offer interactive microcosmic image, however this does not affect its role in virus detection, since rapid clinical diagnosis does not usually require a microcosmic image.",
