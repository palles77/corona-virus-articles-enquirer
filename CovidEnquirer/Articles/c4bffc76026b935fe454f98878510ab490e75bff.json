Since macrophages act as the important defense line against invading pathogens in host innate immunity, we investigated the function and innate immune responses of chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after ALV-J infection in this study. Our results indicated that ALV-J was stably maintained in MDM cells but that the viral growth rate was significantly lower than that in DF-1 cells. We also found that ALV-J infection significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production, but had no effect on MDM phagocytic capacity. Interestingly, infection with ALV-J rapidly promoted the expression levels of Myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx) (3 h, 6 h), ISG12 (6 h), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) (3 h, 12 h) at an early infection stage, whereas it sharply decreased the expression of Mx (24 h, 36 h), ISG12 (36 h), and made little change on IL-1\u03b2 (24 h, 36 h) production at a late infection stage in MDM cells. Moreover, the protein levels of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) had sharply increased in infected MDM cells from 3 to 36 h post infection (hpi) of ALV-J. And, the protein level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was dramatically decreased at 36 hpi in MDM cells infected with ALV-J. These results demonstrate that ALV-J can induce host innate immune responses and we hypothesize that macrophages play an important role in host innate immune attack and ALV-J immune escape.",

However, macrophages can also serve as a retroviral reservoir and directly transmit virus to T cells (Kilareski et al., 2009) . In mammals, macrophages are susceptible to lentiviral infection 42 which often results in persistent infections (Narayan and Clements, 1989) . In contrast, chicken macrophages are resistant to infection by common avian oncogenic viruses such as infectious bronchitis virus, Marek's disease virus, and reticuloendotheliosis virus (von Bulow and Klasen, 1983a; von Bulow and Klasen, 1983b) .

Our results showed that NO production significantly increased in the SCAU-HN06 infected MDM cells at 12, 24, and 36 hpi demonstrating that chicken MDM cells are activated by ALV-J. However, the amount of NO produced in this study was low. We speculate that this phenomenon was related to the pattern recognition receptor for ALV-J. The TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide is the most potent stimulus for NO production in chicken monocytes. Other agonists such as the TLR3 agonist poly I:C as well as the TLR7 agonist loxoribine stimulated little or no NO production (He et al., 2006) . In one of our previous studies, we found that ALV-J was primarily recognized by chicken TLR7 and MDA5 (unpublished data). Therefore we speculate that this is a reason for the lack of NO production in this study. In addition, the phagocytic capacity of MDM cells after ALV-J infection was also unchanged at 24 hpi.",

The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 is a part of the IL-1 family and its presence correlated with some disease states such as influenza and dengue (Xing et al., 2008; Callaway et al., 2015) . IL-6 is also a pro-inflammatory cytokine and is multifunctional in the innate immune response (Schaper and Rose-John, 2015) . In chickens infected with ALV-J, IL-6 was shown to play a key role in inhibiting ALV-J infection (Gao et al., 2015) . In the present study, IL-6 was sustained at high levels from 3 to 36 hpi and IL-1\u03b2 production increased at early stages of infection (3 and 12 hpi). However, virus production was not reduced as indicated by the presence of the p27 vial antigen. In contrast, IL-10 production did not change after ALV-J infection except at 36 hpi where IL-10 protein levels were significantly reduced. IL-10 production was inhibited in the ALV-J infected MDM cells. IL-10 is the most important antiinflammatory cytokine and has immunosuppressive effects (Sabat et al., 2010) . It is produced primarily by activated macrophages and has negative effects by reducing inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 and inhibiting antigen presentation as well as phagocytosis (Sabat et al., 2010) . Previous reports had demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2 either alone or in combination with IL-6 can enhance HIV-1 replication in promonocytic cell lines (Poli et al., 1994) . IL-10 can inhibit HIV-1 replication in human macrophages (Tanaka et al., 2005) and HIV-1 infected macrophages showed an early reduction of IL-10 secretion (Tomlinson et al., 2014) . Our findings indicates that SCAU-HN06 can induce IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 production and block IL-10 production in chicken MDM. These results might indicate that this is a strategy for ALV-J to evade host innate immunity and this deserves further investigation. In addition, IL-1 and IL-6 have been linked with tumorigenesis, which suggests that inflammation is associated with tumor development (Aggarwal et al., 2006) . SCAU-HN06 can induce IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 expression in chicken MDM. Therefore we hypothesize that macrophages play an important role in tumorigenesis induced by ALV-J.",

IFN-\u03b2 belongs to the type I IFN and has antiviral activity in chickens (Sick et al., 1996) . The type I IFN system is triggered by virus and induces hundreds of ISGs such as Mx and ISG12 activated via JAK-STAT pathway. The products of these ISGs exert antiviral effector functions (Schoggins and Rice, 2011) . The Mx proteins have antiviral activity for AIV in mammals (Haller et al., 2007) . However, there is no consistent conclusion about antiviral activity of the chicken Mx protein (Ewald et al., 2011) and some studies suggest that chicken Mx protein lacks antiviral function (Schusser et al., 2011) . ISG12 has been shown to inhibit Newcastle disease virus replication (Liu et al., 2014) . Avian infectious bronchitis virus and infectious bursal disease virus escape from the host antiviral immune response by avoiding the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 response (Ye et al., 2014; Kint et al., 2015) . In this study, IFN-\u03b2 protein levels were sustained at high level in the infected MDM at 3 to 36 hpi. Mx and ISG12 transcription increased at 3 hpi and 6 hpi, and expression was significantly inhibited at 36 hpi. These result showed that SCAU-HN06 can induce the expression of type I IFN and ISGs. However, SCAU-HN06 can also inhibit ISG expression at late infection stages by unknown mechanisms. IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs have no effect on the replication of the ALV-J. Our previous study found that microRNA-23b can promote SCAU-HN06 replication by targeting IRF1 in vitro . IRF-1 is a transcription factor that restricts virus replication by regulating ISG expression (Stirnweiss et al., 2010) . We speculate that ALV-J escapes from or inhibits the host antiviral immune responses via blocking ISG expression and we are investigating this further.",
