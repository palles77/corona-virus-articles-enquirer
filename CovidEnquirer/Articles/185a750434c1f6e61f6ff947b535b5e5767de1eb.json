In this review, we discuss the discovery, antiviral activity and mechanism of action of such peptides. While peptide entry inhibitors have been discovered by a wide variety of approaches (structure-based, accidental, intentional, rational and brute force) we show here that they share a common physical chemical property: they are at least somewhat hydrophobic and/or amphipathic and have a propensity to interact with membrane interfaces. We propose that this propensity drives a shared mechanism of action for many peptide entry inhibitors, involving direct interactions with viral and cellular membranes, as well as interactions with the complex hydrophobic protein/lipid interfaces that are exposed, at least transiently, during virus-cell fusion. By interacting simultaneously with the membrane interfaces and other critical hydrophobic surfaces, we hypothesize that peptide entry inhibitors can act by changing the physical chemistry of the membranes, and the fusion protein interfaces bridging them, and by doing so interfere with the fusion of cellular and viral membranes. Based on this idea, we propose that an approach that focuses on the interfacial hydrophobicity of putative entry inhibitors could lead to the efficient discovery of novel, broad-spectrum viral entry inhibitors.",

Increasingly, focus is shifting toward the development and refinement of techniques for identifying synthetic peptides as drug candidates. Bioactive peptides have been discovered by the use of naturally occurring peptides, through rational engineering, through high-throughput screening, or by structure-based design using sequences from known regions of proteins [3] . These factors are responsible for the emergence of peptides as a growing market in the pharmaceutical industry. Currently there are about 100 peptide based drugs on the market [4] , constituting about 10% of the entire drug market [5] . As we describe below, one effective peptide entry inhibitor of an enveloped virus is approved for use in humans [6] and more are in clinical trials [7, 8] . Many other peptide entry inhibitors of enveloped viruses have been described in the scientific literature. In this review we discuss the surprising observation that the majority of known peptide entry inhibitors, which have been discovered by an extraordinary diversity of approaches, share a common physical chemistry: they are somewhat hydrophobic and amphipathic with a propensity for binding to lipid membranes. We hypothesize that their shared physical chemistry could result in a shared mechanism of action; one that enables a generic approach to the discovery of broad-spectrum peptide entry inhibitors for enveloped viruses.",

These essential steps occur by an incompletely understood process in which viral fusion proteins (i.e. envelope glycoproteins, spike proteins, see Fig. 1 ) mediate a temporally and spatially coordinated close contact between the cellular and viral membranes while simultaneously perturbing the continuity of the membranes with hydrophobic segments. For most enveloped virus families these events are triggered by endocytosis of surface-bound virus and subsequent endosomal acidification. For a few viruses, such as HIV, fusion is triggered by conformational changes that occur upon binding to cell surface receptors and co-receptors and is not entirely dependent on endosomal acidification.",

Class II fusion proteins are defined by their elongated, multi-domain, \u03b2-sheet rich structure and are found, for example, in flaviviruses. Class II fusion proteins are dimeric in the pre-fusion configuration, but transition to a trimeric state during low pH-induced fusion [13] .

In addition to the hydrophobic fusion peptide (which is a terminal peptide in Class I proteins, an internal loop in Class II proteins and a pair of fusion loops in Class III fusion proteins) viral fusion proteins also have other hydrophobic sequences that likely interact with membranes and contribute to the fusion process. For example, many have a conserved, hydrophobic, aromatic-rich domain adjacent to the membrane-spanning helix domain. In HIV, this so called \"membrane proximal ectodomain region\" or MPER is highly conserved and is critical for function [6] . The MPER sequence of HIV gp41 is also the epitope for one of the few broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV [18] . MPER is very hydrophobic, amphipathic and aromatic [18, 19] which suggests that its function likely involves membrane binding and destabilization [20] . Class I viral fusion proteins also have other internal hydrophobic segments, including leucine zipper like-motifs that lie at the interfaces between helical heptad repeat domains that may also become exposed, at least transiently, during the conformational rearrangements that drive fusion [21] . Class II fusion proteins have similar features. For example, they often have conserved aromatic/hydrophobic juxtamembrane domains, called \"stem\" domains, that (like MPER) interact strongly with membrane interfaces and can form amphipathic helixes [22] . In addition to the stem domain, Class II fusion proteins have other hydrophobic regions that are likely involved in the fusion process [16, 17] . Interestingly, arenavirus Class II fusion protein complexes include a so called stable signal peptide (SSP) domain, a conserved and required protein which contains two transmembrane helical segments connected by a loop domain [23] [24] [25] . Unlike most signal sequences, arenavirus SSPs remain stably inserted in the viral envelope and associate with the fusion protein in a complex. These hydrophobic SSPs, whose function remains unknown, have the potential to provide additional hydrophobic surface to the protein-membrane interfaces that arise during fusion. Similarly, the architecture of Class III fusion proteins contains hydrophobic patches that may participate in fusion [14] although less is known about Class III fusion proteins, overall.",

Indeed, there are small molecules that inhibit viral fusion and entry, including inhibitors of influenza [29] and the arenavirus, junin [24] . These compounds function by binding to the fusion protein and inhibiting virus-cell fusion [24, 29] . However, small molecules are not the only possible approach to entry inhibition and may not be ideally suited for interacting with a large conformationally fluid interface between the hydrophobic surfaces that we hypothesize to be critical for inhibition of entry. Larger molecules, such as peptides or other polymers that interact with the hydrophobic membraneprotein interfaces, may also be well suited to be entry inhibitors. For example, it was shown that viral fusion peptides, which are hydrophobic and bind to membranes [32] , can inhibit viral entry [33, 34] . Perhaps most importantly, if inhibition occurs due to physical chemical interactions with a transient, hydrophobic protein-membrane interface, then broad-spectrum entry inhibition, without rapid selection for resistance, is possible. In this review we discuss the many known peptide entry inhibitors of enveloped viruses and show that they are, almost always, hydrophobic and/or amphipathic sequences with a propensity for membrane interface binding.",

            "text": "HIV is a retrovirus that targets and depletes CD4+ T-cells [35] [36] [37] and is responsible for causing AIDS. Globally, tens of millions of people are infected with HIV, leading to 1-2 million deaths per year. The characteristic structural feature of HIV is the presence of protein spikes on its envelope surface [38, 39] . Originally existing as a single chain, gp160, the fusion protein of newly made viruses undergoes proteolytic processing in the Golgi complex by intracellular proteases, producing two subunits, gp120, the distal domain and, gp41, the membrane spanning domain, which is a Class I fusion protein [10] . The collective and co-operative actions of gp120 and gp41 are responsible for promoting viral genome entry into the host cell. The heavily glycosylated gp120 protein is responsible for the recognition and binding of the virus to the host cell, as it binds to the CD4 membrane protein and the co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. Binding triggers the conformational changes in gp41 that ultimately lead to fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane [40, 41] . Like other Class I fusion proteins, gp41 is made of a hydrophobic fusion peptide on the N-terminus and an \u03b1-helical N-terminal helical heptad repeat (NHR) sequence which is connected to a Cterminal helical heptad repeat (CHR) by a loop domain [10] . Following the CHR is the aromatic/hydrophobic MPER domain, a membrane spanning helical anchor and a C-terminal domain which also contains membrane interacting sequences [20, 42] . During entry, the N-terminal fusion peptide of gp41 becomes exposed and likely interacts with the host cell membrane. At the same time, the N-and C-terminal heptad repeat sequences undergo a major transition from the native state to a more extended helical conformation. The heptad repeat domains drive the assembly of an elongated 6-helix bundle in the trimer. These conformational transitions allow the fusion peptide and other hydrophobic sequences, such as MPER, to destabilize the viral and cell membrane, and also bring the membranes into close proximity, ultimately resulting in mixing of the viral and cell membranes, creating a passage for the release of the viral genome in to the cell [37, 43] .",

The discovery of CS3 catalyzed the search for other gp41-derived peptide entry inhibitors for HIV, which ultimately led to the discovery, development and licensure of enfuvirtide (also known as FUSEON or T20). Enfuvirtide is a peptide entry inhibitor for HIV that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for human use in 2003. This injectable antiviral peptide drug is an effective HIV therapeutic belonging to a unique class of entry inhibitor, adding to the already existing classes that include reverse transcriptase inhibitors and HIV protease inhibitors [46, 47] .",

Enfuvirtide may bind to multiple regions of gp120/gp41 [6, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . Enfuvirtide was shown in one study to inhibit genome entry fusion at a step after some lipid mixing had taken place, but before opening of the fusion pore [52] . Enfuvirtide does not form a stable 6-helix bundle in the presence of NHR sequences, unlike some other CHR-derived peptides [48] . Direct evidence of strong, sequencespecific binding of enfuvirtide to gp41 has not been observed, thus it has been suggested that it interacts with transient fusion intermediate states of gp41. A slightly different variant, DP178, binds strongly to synthetic membranes and was suggested to inhibit fusion pore formation [52] via the effect of direct membrane interactions on gp41 structure and dynamics.",

In this approach, potential peptide entry inhibitors are identified by scanning viral fusion proteins for sequences that have a propensity for membrane binding using the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale [53, 54] (see next section), followed by direct experimental measurement of antiviral activities of the small number of candidate sequences to identify those with optimal antiviral activity.

            "text": "The unique physical-chemical environment at the water-membrane interface drives a unique class of hydrophobic interaction that is dominated by the contribution of aromatic residues [53] [54] [55] . To identify and quantitate interfacial, membrane-binding sequences of peptides and proteins it is appropriate to use the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale (WWIHS), an experimentally-determined free energy scale that represents the propensity for individual amino acids, in the context of peptide sequences, to partition from water into a phosphatidylcholine interface [53, 56] . Importantly, the WWIHS is based on whole-residue free energies, and thus has a true zero point that distinguishes peptide sequences that have a propensity to interact with membranes from those that do not. There are two ways that WWIHS scores have been used in the literature and in this review. i) WWIHS is used in the \"hydropathy analysis\" mode to calculate a sliding window hydrophobicity score along the sequence of a protein. This approach identifies segments of a protein with a propensity to interact with membrane interfaces. ii) WWIHS is used in the \"totalizer\" mode to calculate the overall interfacial hydrophobicity of a particular peptide sequence. This approach is an accurate predictor of membrane interaction propensity [57] . Here, we calculate WWIHS values by default at low pH (where aspartate and glutamate are uncharged and histidine is charged) to simulate the low pH environment of the endosome (pH 5.0-5.5) where most viral fusion takes place. In support of this assumption, we note that the pKa values of acidic groups on peptides [58, 59] and other molecules [60] are shifted into the range of 6.0 to 7.5 by environmental factors when they are bound to membranes. WWIHS values are calculated assuming random coil peptides partitioned into the bilayer interface. The values are thus minimum possible values, as \u0394G can only get more favorable if peptide binding promotes an increase in secondary structure, as is often the case. The possible increase in \u0394G with secondary structure (favoring membrane binding) has been estimated to be between 0.3 and 0.6 kcal/mol/residue [58, 59] and thus can be a very large effect.",

A peptide with a large iHHM can interact strongly with membranes as a helix due to partitioning-folding coupling [58, 59] even when its WWIHS score is not positive overall. Although the exact relationship between partitioning and folding cannot be extracted quantitatively from iHHM, it provides useful landmarks as shown in Table 1 .

The global health crisis caused by dengue virus [62] [63] [64] demonstrates the critical importance of novel therapeutics to public health. Dengue is a vector-borne viral disease, transmitted to humans via infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in tropical and sub-tropical regions, with recent expansion to temperate climates. The global incidence of dengue has increased by 30-fold in the past five decades. Despite formidable efforts, no licensed vaccine or approved therapeutic options are available. Dengue infections vary in severity from asymptomatic, to febrile manifestations, to potentially life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The estimated annual number of infections worldwide stands at 100 million, but this number may be underreported. The annual number of DHS or DSS cases is between 500,000-1 million, with an estimated 22,000 deaths, mainly among children.",

The emergence and spread of West Nile virus in North America is a particularly well-documented example of the potential for sudden emergence of public health risk posed by vector borne enveloped viruses. West Nile virus is endemic in Asia, the Middle East and Australia. However, in 1999 West Nile virus infections in humans were identified, and several deaths were reported in Queens, New York, probably after the virus was introduced by an infected bird or animal [65] . The virus spread very rapidly across North America, and then to Central America, rising to about 10,000 identified cases, and about 300 deaths in the US by 2003 [65] . Because the disease is usually mild, the actual number of cases may be as much as 100-fold larger than the reported number [65] . West Nile virus is now endemic across North America. Morbidity and mortality from West Nile virus do occur, usually resulting from viral encephalitis or meningitis [65]. This example illustrates the urgent need for broad-spectrum therapies against enveloped viruses because a future continental or global pandemic might be caused by an enveloped virus that causes high morbidity and mortality.",

After its initial outbreak in China, SARS CoV infected at least 8000 individuals in 2003 leading to~700 fatalities [33, 70] . The high mortality rate of SARS elicited fears of a deadly global pandemic [33, 71] . Very recently, a related coronavirus with similarly high mortality, called the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV, has emerged [20, 72] . The rapid rise and spread of MERS once again raised fears of a global pandemic caused by a virus for which there are no known therapeutics. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses that follow the classical pathway of entry and infection as other enveloped viruses. The surface glycoprotein or fusion protein of the virus, called the S protein, is a typical Class I fusion protein and is divided into two subunits. The S1 subunit is responsible for the binding of the virus to the host cell receptor and the S2 subunit drives fusion of the viral and host membrane [71, 73] . To identify inhibitory peptides against SARS CoV, Sainz et al. [71] analyzed the S2 subunit of the SARS CoV fusion protein using WWIHS. They identified five peptide sequences with high WWIHS scores: SARS WW-I -SARS WW-V (Fig. 5) . The hydrophobic SARS WW-I (WWIHS = 6.2) sequence is the fusion peptide [22] , peptides II, III and IV are found just outside of the heptadrepeat sequences between the N-and C-helical heptad repeat domains. SARS WW-V corresponds to the aromatic-rich juxtamembrane domain, analogous to the stem domain from which DN59 was obtained. Sainz et al. showed that the peptides from all five regions caused measurable inhibition of virus infection, and that SARS WW-III (WWIHS = 5.7) and SARS WW-IV (WWIHS = 7.1) showed the greatest inhibition in vitro with IC 50 of 2-4 \u03bcM. SARS WW-III and SARS WW-IV were hypothesized to inhibit the conformation change required by the S2 protein during fusion, although the exact mechanism of action remains unknown. In the same paper, Sainz et al. showed that a peptide from the Class I murine hepatitis virus, corresponding to the same hydrophobic segment as SARS WW-IV inhibited MHV and SARS in vitro with IC 50 = 4 \u03bcM. However, the equivalent SARS peptide did not inhibit MHV.",

However, infection just before or during pregnancy is associated with high morbidity and mortality for the fetus [74] . Similarly, its widespread abundance leads to high rates of infection and disease in immunocompromised patients, where it can lead to retinitis and blindness. HCMV has a Class III fusion protein in a complex composed of glycoproteins gB, gH and gL. Glycoprotein B (gB) has the primary role in binding and fusion of the virus with the host cell [75, 76] . HCMV can enter many different cell types using an array of envelope glycoproteins, in conjunction with gB. While fusion and entry often occur after endocytosis and acidification, there is also evidence of fusion at neutral pH [76] . Melnik et al. [77] identified nine peptides selected from gB based on their propensity for membrane partitioning as per the WWIHS (Fig. 6) . Four of these peptides (WWIHS = 3-5) showed \u226550% inhibition of HCMV at 1-5 \u03bcM peptide [77] .

Peptides that were not conjugated to tat had no measurable inhibition when added 24 h post infection while tat conjugated peptides had IC 50 values between 1 and 10 \u03bcM at 24 h. As tatcargo conjugates are known to bind to cells and enter by endocytosis [79] , this result suggests strongly that entry inhibition takes place in the endosomal compartments which can be readily accessed by tatconjugated peptides.

RVFV infection, which is sometimes accompanied by severe hemorrhagic disease, can be fatal to both humans and livestock [81] [82] [83] . This mosquito-borne virus is endemic in parts of Africa and the Arabian peninsula and has emerged as a significant public health concern [81-83] and as a potential biothreat agent. As a consequence, RVFV is an NIAID category A priority pathogen, the highest possible priority. The G n and G c surface glycoproteins are responsible for the binding and entry of the virus to the host cell. G n is a Class II fusion protein. The mechanism of fusion for RVFV has not been well studied, however it can be modeled using the well characterized fusion process of other Class II fusion proteins [82, 84] . To identify inhibitory peptides for RVFV, Koehler et al. [82] identified candidates from the sequence of the G n fusion protein that have positive WWIHS scores (Fig. 7) . They identified 5 regions of positive WWIHS score, which included the fusion loop peptide and the hydrophobic, aromatic juxtamembrane \"stem\" domain. Because the stem domain peptides had the best activity, the authors tested a series of truncation and translation variants. The most active peptide, RVFV-6, (WWIHS = 11.5) is very hydrophobic and showed \u2265 95% inhibition of RVFV at 25 \u03bcM concentration [82] with an IC 50 around 5-10 \u03bcM. The authors showed that RVFV-6 binds directly to both cells and virus, and probably inhibits viral entry by inhibiting the fusion step. In support of the somewhat generalizable nature of membrane binding peptide entry inhibitors, RVFP-6 also inhibits an enveloped virus with a Class I fusion proteins (Ebola) and an enveloped virus with Class III fusion proteins (vesicular stomatitis virus). However, it did not inhibit any of three equine encephalitis viruses tested.",

Interestingly, AVP-p significantly changes the fluidity and organization of the lipids, but it does not bind stably or measurably to the GP2 fusion protein. Despite not interacting with GP2 directly, AVP-p, by cryoTEM and biochemical assays, prematurely triggers the fusion-competent state of GP2, even at neutral pH. Rather than promote infectivity, premature fusion competence is inhibitory, consistent with the proposed critical role of the timing of events for productive fusion. An important conclusion from this work is that a peptide that interacts directly with viral membranes can change their physical properties in a way that affects the structure and function of the fusion protein. A similar conclusion was drawn about the mechanism of action of DP178 against HIV [52] .

Instead, bioinformatics analyses of the HCV E1 protein suggest that it is a truncated Class II fusion protein ( To identify HCV-inhibiting peptides, Sabahi [34] tested overlapping 18-residue peptides from E1 and E2, and also from the viroporin-like p7 protein, for liposome disruption, liposome fusion and viral inhibition. Peptides from five different segments of E1, E2 and p7 showed significant activity against liposomes.

The same peptides were not active against pseudotype viruses corresponding to murine leukemia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus. Regarding the overarching hypothesis of this review, the HCV data provided by Sabahi et al., are revealing. They directly demonstrate good overlap between predicted membrane binding, experimentally observed membrane perturbation, and antiviral activity. They also show that the overlap is incomplete, similar to the roughly 50% correlation between positive WWIHS scores and entry inhibition in the examples described above. It also agrees with the observations above that cross species inhibition is frequently observed, but is often incomplete.

In vitro, the peptide they designed, a 32-mer called CP32M, (WWIHS = \u22128.7; iHHM = 14.4 at pH 7), is a very potent entry inhibitor against many strains of HIV, including enfuvirtide-resistant strains [98, 99] , with IC 50 values ranging from nM to pM.

Like enfuvirtide and DP178 [48, 52] , CP32M was shown to function by inhibition of fusion. Later, both CP32M and the shorter variants were shown by X-ray crystallography to interact with a protein construct containing the core three helix bundle of the N-terminal heptad repeat sequences of gp41. The inhibitors are helical and lie with their hydrophobic face in the hydrophobic groove between the NHR helices [99, 100] , just as the CHR helices interact in the post fusion 6-helix bundle of native gp41.",

While the WWIHS score for these peptides is negative at neutral pH, their interfacial helical hydrophobic moments are extremely large because the authors made sequence changes intended to create essentially ideal amphipathic helices. Thus, these peptides have a propensity to bind membranes and any other hydrophobic surface by folding into \u03b1-helices. In the context of the central hypothesis of this review, this study may be revealing. Some of the engineered sequences are highly active against multiple strains of HIV, yet bear little sequence resemblance to the native sequence of gp41. Compared to CP32M, the active sequences have more than half of their residues changed with dramatically non-conservative substitutions including M \u2192 E, I \u2192 K, L \u2192 K, K \u2192 E, I \u2192 E, E \u2192 I and E \u2192 K.

For example Rapaport et al. [101] described an inhibitory CHR peptide from the fusion protein of sendai virus. Similarly, Lambert et al. [102] tested enfuvirtide-like CHR sequences from respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and measles virus, reporting speciesspecific inhibition of all three in vitro at sub \u03bcM concentrations. Lamb et al. [103] reported that CHR peptides from human T-lymphocyte leukemia virus and bovine leukemia virus inhibit virus entry in a species specific manner. Upon the discovery and identification of the SARS coronavirus in 2003, several groups [33, 71] identified CHR-based peptide entry inhibitors from the SARS Class I fusion protein, S2, using the enfuvirtide/gp41 system as a model.

Whether sequence specific, native like interactions are essential for activity is not certain. In any case, this interaction, which may occur only with transient intermediate structures, is likely to interfere with the structure and function of the fusion protein during the critical events of fusion. While some CHR entry inhibitors bind stably and specifically to partial gp41 NHR sequences [10] , others apparently do not. Despite evidence that these CHR peptides may act by sequence specific interactions, they have one universal feature in common that makes them similar to the other membrane interacting sequences described elsewhere in this review. They are highly amphipathic, with iHHM values between 5 and 15 kcal/mol. This property arises from the fact that, in the native structure, they pack into a very hydrophobic groove in the NHR three helix core that is present in all Class I fusion proteins. Peptides with very large iHHM scores are likely to fold into \u03b1-helices and interact with any available hydrophobic surface. Enfuvirtide analogs interact with membranes, thus supporting this hypothesis [48] . The idea that membrane binding may be important is also strengthened by the observation that an inactive enfuvirtide variant with several hydrophobic residues removed from the C-terminus can have its activity restored by the C-terminal addition of an octyl chain [100] .",

Unmodified leash domain peptides, including the longest and most hydrophobic variant GTYDHDVYRDEALNNRFQIKGV ELKSGYKDW (WWIHS = 2.1; iHHM = 4.7) were inactive against influenza virus in vitro. These authors then attached cholesterol to the amino termini of the leash peptides. This modification by a very hydrophobic cholesterol will effectively tether the peptide to the membrane. Cholesterol-modified leash peptides were found to be potent inhibitors, with EC 50 values as low as 0.4 \u03bcM. These authors showed that entry inhibition is due to inhibition of fusion, and that multiple strains of influenza virus can be inhibited by cholesterol-conjugated leash peptides. They postulated that cholesterol conjugation insures that the peptide becomes co-encapsulated in the endosome with the virus and can act on the fusion protein when the pH decreases.",

This peptide has an N-terminal solubility sequence, RRKK followed by a hydrophobic, uncharged 16 residue sequence, AAVALLPAVLLALLAP, (WWIHS = 3.5) that has a propensity for membrane interaction. EB inhibits numerous unrelated viruses, including herpes simplex virus [28] , influenza virus [106] and vaccinia (small pox) virus [107] , consistent with inhibition that is dependent on peptide physical chemistry, rather than on sequence-specific interactions with viral fusion proteins. Inhibition of viral entry by EB occurs at an early stage, likely by inhibition of fusion [108, 109] . Brandt and colleagues showed that EB pre-incubation protected cells from virus, showing that the peptide binds to, or enters, cells [108, 109] .

Following this discovery, the authors identified the linear peptide sequence of RhoA responsible for the interaction, ILMCFSIDSPDSLEN (WWIHS = 4.4). While a physiologically relevant interaction between the fusion protein of RSV and RhoA seemed unlikely, the peptide was nonetheless found to inhibit RSV infection in vitro [21] . The same peptide also inhibits HIV [21] . Subsequent investigation confirmed that viral inhibition was unrelated to any putative interaction with RhoA. Instead the RhoAderived peptides, which are hydrophobic, interact directly with the virus, and by doing so block cellular binding and entry. In agreement with the hypothesis we are exploring in this review, these authors concluded that \"the antiviral activity of RhoA-derived peptides is \u2026 a function of the peptides' 'intrinsic biophysical properties'\" and that \"the combination of hydrophobicity and negative charge appears to be an effective pattern for many antiviral molecules that target RSV as well as many other enveloped viruses\" [21] .",

When the whole set was tested for antiviral activity, seven peptides were identified that inhibit HSV. Three of the peptides were not tested further because they were insoluble (a common problem for the antiviral peptides discussed throughout this review). The three most active peptides had IC 50 values less than 20 \u03bcM, in vitro. In Fig. 11 , we show the structure and WWIHS score of the gB-1 protein with the positions of the seven inhibitory peptides in red. In very strong support of our overarching hypothesis that membrane interface binding peptides can broadly inhibit viral entry, most of the seven antiviral peptides identified by this nonbiased, brute force approach overlap with peaks of positive WWIHS score in the C-terminal portion of the fusion protein. There were also several positive WWIHS segments that did not show activity, a result that is consistent with the success rate reported above for intentionally identifying antiviral peptides using WWIHS. Thus, the efficiency of the approach described earlier of identifying candidates based on WWIHS and then testing the small number of candidates directly for activity is further validated by this work. The authors systematically measured, for each soluble antiviral peptide, direct viral inactivation, inhibition of cell binding, inhibition of entry, and host cell protection. They found that the peptides act mostly through entry inhibition, with a small contribution of direct viral inactivation and host cell protection. No inhibition of cell binding was observed.",

            "text": "Similarly, Cheng et al. [27] used a comprehensive set of 441 overlapping 18 residue peptides against the entire polyprotein of hepatitis C virus. They identified 11 peptides with significant antiviral activity, many of which have positive WWIHS scores. The most active inhibitory peptide, called C5A, is very hydrophobic and has a strong membrane binding propensity. It is an amphipathic helix from the membrane anchor domain of the nonstructural protein NS5A. C5A, SWLRDIWDWI CEVLSDFK, (WWIHS = 9.0, iHHM = 5.2) interacts directly with the hepatitis C viral envelope and is virolytic with EC 50 \u2264 1 \u03bcM. It blocks infection most actively if incubated with virus during/prior to the initial entry stage. Interestingly, C5A also eliminated virus in chronically infected cells, suggesting that it can enter cells. C5A made from L-amino acids and C5A made from D-amino acids had the same biological activity [112] . In a separate study C5A was shown to also have potent activity against HIV, and its activity was shown to be due to direct disruption of the viral envelope integrity [112] . In this study also, C5A was able to inhibit an already established HIV infection in vitro. However C5A does not inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus, nor does it inhibit a nonenveloped adenovirus. A less amphipathic but equally hydrophobic variant of C5A with two pairs of amino acids swapped in position is not active against HCV or HIV. C5A permeabilized lipid vesicles with high potency like a lytic toxin, which is consistent with its high WWIHS score and high amphipathicity. However, unlike non-specific lytic peptides (e.g. melittin from bee venom [113] ) C5A does not disrupt cellular membranes and is not toxic against living mammalian cells at low concentration [112] .",

[112] made a series of C5A variants with altered hydrophobicity and helicity. The anti HCV and anti-HIV activities of these variants in vitro were remarkably similar. Of the 14 variants studied against the two viruses, at least 9 had IC 50 values between 0.5 and 5 \u03bcM, demonstrating, again, that entry inhibition is not a highly sequence dependent activity and that sequence changes do not abrogate antiviral activity if they do not diminish interfacial hydrophobicity or amphipathicity.

[114] tested all overlapping 18 amino acid peptides from four proteins thought to be important in the entry of hepatitis C virus: CD81, scavenger receptor B1, claudin 1 and occludin. They tested 113 peptides. Two overlapping peptides from claudin 1 were very potent inhibitors of HCV. These peptides, called CL-58 (MANAGLQLLGFILAFLGW, WWIHS = 8.1; iHHM = 2.5) and CL-59 (AFLGWIGAIVSTALPQWR, WWIHS = 6.0; iHHM = 4.3) are uncharged, very hydrophobic and amphipathic sequences. In fact, these sequences are part of the first membrane spanning \u03b1-helix in the claudin-1 protein, and thus are presumably buried in the membrane and not accessible to the virus during entry. These inhibitory sequences block HCV pseudovirus entry and whole virus entry with EC 50 around 1-3 \u03bcM. They also suppress established HCV infections in cell culture. Inhibition of entry does not occur at the binding step, and the effect of peptide can be removed by washing the virus or the cells. A large number of translation and truncation variants were tested. More than half had similar activity to CL-58 and CL-59. While a scrambled peptide is mostly inactive, the D-amino acid CL-58 peptide is fully active, suggesting that sequence specific intermolecular interactions are not involved in the entry inhibition.",

Peptide p1, DTRACDVIALLCH LNT, (WWIHS = 1.9) is more hydrophobic than the two inactive sequences and has a small, but positive WWIHS score. A series of truncation and insertion peptides were tested to find sequences with increased activity. The most hydrophobic of the variants tested, CDVIAL LACHLNT, (WWIHS = 3.0), called P9, was also the most potent inhibitor of West Nile virus, with IC 50 = 2.6 \u03bcM. The authors also tested the peptides against the related dengue virus, which has a fusion protein that is 47% identical to that of West Nile virus. Interestingly, against dengue, the opposite relative activities of P1 and P9 were found: P1 was highly active while P9 was not active. Finally, the authors showed that P9 inhibited West Nile virus in a mouse model with brain involvement, decreasing viral loads and increasing survival dramatically [115] . Remarkably, the peptide P9 was apparently able to cross the blood brain barrier, an important property for therapeutics intended to treat viruses that replicate in the brain.",

These authors examined peptides from the E2 protein and identified two overlapping E2 peptides, WDRGNV TLLCDCPNGPWVWV, (WWIHS = 6.5, iHHM = 3.5) and LCDCPNGP WVWVPAFCQAVG (WWIHS = 5.4, iHHM = 2.9) that inhibit HIV in vitro. These peptides are rich in aromatic residues and are both hydrophobic and amphipathic, giving them a strong propensity for membrane interaction. They inhibit HIV in cell culture with IC 50 values of 2 and 0.2 \u03bcM, respectively. The authors showed that the two peptides inhibited HIV entry, and do so at an early step, but one that occurs after cell-surface binding, probably fusion. They also showed that this effect is due to an interaction with the HIV gp41 fusion protein that alters its conformational rearrangement, and may prevent the formation of the 6-helix bundle needed for fusion. These authors concluded that the E2 peptides specifically bind at the gp41-gp120 interface based on competitive binding assays and weak sequence similarity between the E2 peptides and HIV gp41. Based on the fact the physical chemistry of the E2 peptides is very similar to the many peptides discussed here, we hypothesize that their mechanism of action may include non-sequence specific interactions between the peptides and the hydrophobic surfaces of the fusion protein-membrane complex.",

            "text": "Cationic antimicrobial peptides constitute a collection of more than 1000 known peptides that are extraordinarily diverse in secondary and tertiary structure, but have similar antibacterial and antifungal activities. AMPs are found in all classes of life and are a critical part of the innate immune systems of vertebrates and invertebrates [118] [119] [120] . Most vertebrates, including humans, produce many different AMPs that have broad spectrum activity against many types of bacteria and unicellular fungi. The activity of AMPs against bacteria has been studied intensively since their discovery in the 1980s [121, 122] . While there are some variations, a unifying mechanism of antibacterial action has emerged from many studies [118, 123] : AMPs preferentially bind to the anionic plasma membranes of bacteria (both Gram positive and Gram negative) and, by virtue of their interfacial activity [123] , disrupt the organization and continuity of bacterial membranes. The degree of membrane disruption increases sequentially [124] [125] [126] from loss of transmembrane potential within seconds, to leakage of small molecules, leakage of macromolecules and finally destruction of overall cellular architecture. The membrane disrupting nature of AMPs arises from the fact that they are amphipathic, with polar and hydrophobic surfaces, but that the hydrophobic surfaces are interrupted by polar/ cationic residues. We have described how their \"interfacial activity\" is dependent on \"imperfect amphipathicity\" [123] . Antiviral activity has been observed, in vitro, for multiple AMPs and it has been proposed that they have evolved to have antiviral activity as well as antibacterial activity. For example, LL37 is a 37-residue cationic, amphipathic helical AMP that is released from neutrophil granules and epithelial cells and that has broad-spectrum activity against many bacteria and pathogenic fungi. Recent reports [127] have shown that LL37 also has broad-spectrum activity against influenza A viruses, in vitro, by a mechanism that is consistent with entry inhibition. The IC 50 of LL37 is in the low \u03bcM range. LL37-dependent inhibition of virus-cell binding was not observed. Instead, like the anti-dengue peptide DN59 discussed above, LL37 caused a direct physical disruption of the viral membrane [127] . LL37 does not have a favorable WWIHS score, overall, but interacts with membranes because it folds into an \u03b1-helix with a very hydrophobic face. The interfacial helical hydrophobic moment, iHHM, of LL37 is 14.2 at neutral pH, which is an extremely high value (see Table 1 ).",

A significant proportion of those antiviral peptides are entry inhibitors, the class we have discussed in this review. Most of the peptide entry inhibitors described here were initially expected to inhibit viral entry by providing sequence-specific competitive inhibition of intermolecular interactions, mostly involving the viral fusion proteins. However, in the many studies we examined, there is little evidence of highly sequence specific interactions, other than the evidence provided by some Class I, CHR-derived peptides mimicking enfuvirtide. Instead there is strong evidence of generic activity for most peptide entry inhibitors. Peptides that were tested against other enveloped viruses often show at least some cross-species inhibition, even against unrelated viruses. The D-enantiomers show activity, when tested, as do some truncations, insertions and other sequence variations. Yet, even without blocking specific protein-protein interactions, these many peptides effectively inhibit virus entry into cells in vitro with EC 50 values from sub nM to low \u03bcM. In the few cases reported, inhibition also occurs in vivo.",

Some of the peptides have direct physical effects on the virus particles, causing either physical disruption of the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope (virolysis) or causing virus aggregation. Some have been shown to bind to and affect synthetic membranes. Some inhibitory peptides are reported to inhibit binding of viruses to cells, which has been attributed to direct peptide interactions with the virus particles. Other peptides seem to act at the level of membrane fusion, inhibiting fusion of bound virus to cells. In at least one case, fusion inhibition was due to premature initiation of the fusion protein conformation after peptide binding to the viral envelope membrane. Some peptide entry inhibitors bind directly to cells and interfere with virus binding and/or fusion at the cell surface, which may occur only after endocytosis of bound peptide and virus. Many studies suggest that multiple mechanisms are at play simultaneously.",

In other words, the peptide entry inhibitors discussed here share overlapping mechanisms of action that are derived from their shared physical chemistry as follows: Essentially all the peptide entry inhibitors that we identified are at least somewhat hydrophobic and/or amphipathic with a propensity to bind to bilayer membrane interfaces and other hydrophobic surfaces. Many of them are very hydrophobic and/or highly amphipathic. Furthermore, many of them have acidic isoelectric points so that the low pH environment of late endosomes, where most viral cell fusion takes place, will trigger loss of charge and increased membrane binding. Except for anti-HIV peptides (because HIV fusion takes place at neutral pH) the WWIHS scores we report here reflect the low pH, membrane-bound state where aspartate and glutamate are effectively uncharged and histidine is charged. It is not known, at this time, whether membrane binding can directly affect viral fusion, or whether interaction with the fusion protein itself is an absolute requirement for entry inhibition. However we note, as did Rapaport et al. 20 years ago [101] , that membrane binding of an inhibitory peptide will greatly increase the effective concentration of the peptide in the vicinity of the fusion protein thus interaction with membrane and interaction with the fusion protein may be effectively coupled.",

These characteristics include the size, shape and underlying secondary structure of exposed hydrophobic patches, as well as the nature of the polar or charged residues that are near the hydrophobic surfaces. Thus, on the one hand similarities across all classes of fusion proteins give rise to frequent cross-species inhibition by peptide entry inhibitors. But on the other hand, variation in the physical details of the exposed hydrophobic surfaces causes some peptide entry inhibitors to be inactive against some enveloped viruses.",

For example, the spike proteins of enveloped viruses are very crowded in the viral membrane (see Fig. 1 ) and may interact laterally, leading to the proposal that the conformational change that drives fusion is a cooperative event involving all of the spikes in a virus particle nearly simultaneously. If this is true, then cooperativity results from lateral interactions between proteins, perhaps including the TM domains. Thus, membrane physical properties could be critically important to the events that drive viral entry and it should be possible for peptides to interfere with the function of viral fusion proteins by changing the physical chemistry of the membrane itself by direct interaction. Evidence for this mechanism was discussed above for several peptide entry inhibitors.",

Hydrophobic peptides that partition into membranes should also be able to cross cell membranes and enter cells. They may also cross endothelial layers in vivo, perhaps even including the blood brain barrier [115] . Thus peptides that function as entry inhibitors against viruses in vitro by the mechanism we propose here may inherently also have promising bioavailability characteristics in vivo due to membrane binding and translocation. This idea is supported by the very long half time of enfuvirtide in humans (tens of hours) compared to most peptides (minutes). In support of this possibility, we have shown directly that some peptide entry inhibitors can translocate across plasma membranes and enter cells (H. Badani and W.C. Wimley, not shown).",

While a few drugs have been developed against HIV, influenza virus, and a few other viruses, these drugs are not ideal, and viruses often become resistant. For most enveloped viruses, there are no effective therapies. Thus entry inhibition represents an attractive and underutilized target in the search for new therapeutics. The hypothesis we have described here, that peptide entry inhibitors act by physical chemical interaction with hydrophobic surfaces exposed during fusion, suggests a novel approach to the discovery of entry inhibitors, one that focuses on the physical chemistry of putative entry inhibitors. Instead of the mostly brute force, structure based or accidental discovery in the literature to date, we propose that an intentional search for novel hydrophobic/ amphipathic peptide entry inhibitors based on their physical chemistry, with an orthogonal selection for other critical properties such as solubility and pH sensitivity, could result in highly optimized and clinically effective peptide inhibitors of viral entry. Furthermore, since native-like, specific intermolecular interactions are probably not important, entry inhibitors can be made using protease resistant non-natural or Damino acid peptides, using peptide mimetics such as peptide-nucleic acids or beta-peptides, or using polymers unrelated to peptides.",
