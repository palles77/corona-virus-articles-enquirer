            "text": "Our understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis and consequences of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has increased substantially in the last decade. Several new lines of evidence demonstrate that bacterial isolation from sputum during acute exacerbation in many instances refl ects a cause-effect relationship. Placebo-controlled antibiotic trials in exacerbations of COPD demonstrate signifi cant clinical benefi ts of antibiotic treatment in moderate and severe episodes. However, in the multitude of antibiotic comparison trials, the choice of antibiotics does not appear to affect the clinical outcome, which can be explained by several methodological limitations of these trials. Recently, comparison trials with nontraditional end-points have shown differences among antibiotics in the treatment of exacerbations of COPD. Observational studies that have examined clinical outcome of exacerbations have repeatedly demonstrated certain clinical characteristics to be associated with treatment failure or early relapse. Optimal antibiotic selection for exacerbations has therefore incorporated quantifying the risk for a poor outcome of the exacerbation and choosing antibiotics differently for low risk and high risk patients, reserving the broader spectrum drugs for the high risk patients. Though improved outcomes in exacerbations with antibiotic choice based on such risk stratifi cation has not yet been demonstrated in prospective controlled trials, this approach takes into account concerns of disease heterogeneity, antibiotic resistance and judicious antibiotic use in exacerbations.",

Furthermore, this recovery is delayed if exacerbations Siddiqi and Sethi recur during this recover period (Spencer and Jones 2003) . Contrary to previous studies, recent data has shown that the frequency of exacerbations is associated with accelerated long term decline in lung function as measured by the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ). This has been shown in mild disease, in the Lung Health Study, where every lower respiratory tract illness was associated with an additional loss of 7 ml of FEV 1 (Kanner et al 2001) . Patients with moderate to severe COPD who experience more frequent exacerbations also experience a decline in FEV 1 of 40 ml/yr in contrast to a decline of 32 ml/year among patients with infrequent exacerbations (Donaldson et al 2002) .",

Substantial progress has also been made in understanding their etiology and pathogenesis. In contrast, clinical studies of adequate design and quality that can help us determine the optimal management approach to exacerbations are still relatively few. Among the therapeutic options for the treatment of acute exacerbations are antibiotics. Though widely used for the treatment of exacerbations, their use is still debated and whether antibiotic choice is important is controversial (Hirschmann 2000; Murphy et al 2000) . The optimal approach to antibiotic treatment of exacerbations relies upon an accurate diagnosis, including judicious application of diagnostic tests. This needs to be followed by determining the severity of an exacerbation, the probability that it is bacterial and whether antibiotics are indicated. Once the decision is made that antibiotics are indeed indicated, then a risk stratifi cation approach allows us to choose an appropriate antibiotic.",

Severity has been also measured by site of care, with hospitalized exacerbations regarded as severe, outpatient exacerbations regarded as moderate and self medicated exacerbations as mild (GOLD 2007) . This classifi cation is prone to error as the site of care is dependent on differences among countries and health care systems as to the threshold for admission, patient and physician preferences etc. Another suggested measure of severity of exacerbations is the intensity of treatment recommended, with treatment with bronchodilators only indicating mild exacerbations, while treatment with antibiotics and steroids in addition to bronchodilators regarded as indicating moderate or severe exacerbations.

This determination of severity is relatively simple and does correlate with benefi t with antibiotics, with such benefi t seen only in Type 1 and 2 exacerbations. However, there are limitations to the Anthonisen severity classifi cation. It has not been validated against objective measures of severity. The association with benefi t with antibiotics has not been reproduced in other studies. Another limitation is the lack of gradation of severity within each symptom, such that an exacerbation with mild dyspnea and mild increase in sputum would be regarded as the same severity in this classifi cation as one with a marked increase in both symptoms.",

Measurement of airway infl ammation in induced or expectorated sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial biopsy has revealed that increased airway infl ammation is indeed present in acute exacerbation and resolves with treatment. Both neutrophilic and eosinophilic infl ammation has been described, with the former associated with a bacterial etiology and the latter with viral infection. Any stimulus that acutely increases airway infl ammation could lead to increased bronchial tone, edema in the bronchial wall and mucus production. In an already diseased lung, these processes could worsen ventilation-perfusion mismatch and expiratory fl ow limitation. Corresponding clinical manifestations are dyspnea, cough, increased sputum production, tenacity and purulence along with worsening gas exchange, which are the cardinal manifestations of an exacerbation. Increases in plasma fi brinogen, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and c-reactive protein (CRP), consistent with a heightened state of systemic infl ammation have been described during exacerbations (Dev et al 1998; Wedzicha et al 2000) .

NTHI, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the predominant bacterial causes of two other common respiratory mucosal infections, acute otitis media in children and acute sinusitis in children and adults. These mucosal infections have been related to anatomical abnormalities with impaired drainage of secretions, antecedent viral infections and defects in innate and adaptive immunity. All these predisposing factors likely exist in COPD. These three pathogens are all exclusively human pathogens that are transmitted among individuals. In healthy hosts, their presence is confi ned to the upper airway and does not cause any clinical manifestations. It is likely that acquisition of these pathogens in a patient with COPD, because of compromised lung defense, allows establishment of infection in the lower respiratory tract, with or without overt clinical manifestations.",

            "text": "Our understanding of acute exacerbation pathogenesis, especially in relation to bacterial infection, has seen signifi cant progress over the last few years. Both host and pathogen factors are involved in development of acute bacterial exacerbations ( Figure 1 ). Acquisition of strains of bacterial pathogens that are new to the host from the environment appears to be the primary event that puts the patient with COPD at risk for an exacerbation . Variations among strains of a species in the surface antigenic structure, as is seen with NTHI, S pneumoniae and M catarrhalis allow these newly acquired strains to escape the pre-existing host immune response that had developed following prior exposure to other strains of the same species of bacteria. These strains can therefore proliferate in the lower airways and induce acute infl ammation in the airways. The virulence of the strain and as yet unidentifi ed host factors may determine if the acute infl ammatory response to the pathogen reaches the threshold to cause symptoms that present as an exacerbation (Chin et al 2005) . In many instances, the adaptive immune response results in development of mucosal and systemic antibodies to the pathogen Murphy et al 2005) . This immune response, in combination with appropriate antibiotics, is able to eliminate or control proliferation of the infecting bacteria. However, because of antigenic variability among strains of these bacterial species, the antibodies that develop to the infecting strain are usually strain-specifi c, and do not provide protection to the host from other antigenically distinct strains of the same species. This allows the process of recurrent bacterial infection and exacerbations in these patients. The pathogenesis of acute viral exacerbations is less well understood. However, it appears to be similar to bacterial infections. A common cause of exacerbations, the rhinovirus, demonstrates considerable antigenic variation among its more than 100 serotypes, allowing for recurrent infections. The infl uenza virus demonstrates drift in the antigenic makeup of its major surface proteins, thereby leading to recurrent infections. In vitro, viruses can damage airway epithelium, stimulate muscarinic receptors, and induce eosinophilic infl ux by stimulating the secretion of RANTES (Johnston et al 1998) . These pro-infl ammatory actions could potentially induce the pathophysiological manifestations that characterize acute exacerbation when a viral agent infects the lower airway of a patient with COPD. The pathogenesis of exacerbations with atypical bacterial infection is poorly understood.",

Though these goals are undoubtedly important, several new observations question the adequacy of these goals. These include our new understanding of the importance of exacerbations in the course of COPD, the role of infection in exacerbations, the high rates of relapse with an adequate initial clinical response, and the role played by chronic infection in the pathogenesis of COPD. To draw an analogy, confi ning our goal in the treatment of COPD exacerbations to short term resolution of symptoms would be the equivalent of treating acute myocardial infarction with the only aim being resolution of chest pain. Several other important goals of treatment, both clinical and biological, should be considered (Table 3) . For instance, clinical success in the treatment of exacerbations has been defi ned as resolution of symptoms to baseline or improvement of symptoms to a degree that no further treatment is required in the opinion of the treating physician. If symptoms do indeed correlate with exaggerated airway and systemic infl ammation, then acceptance of clinical improvement rather than clinical resolution has important implications. Clinical improvement may refl ect inadequate treatment, permitting the infl ammatory process that underlies the exacerbation to persist for prolonged periods of time . Therefore, clinical resolution of symptoms to baseline may actually represent the optimal outcome. Other important clinical goals of treatment include delaying the next exacerbation, prevention of early relapse and more rapid resolution of symptoms (Anzueto et al 1999; Aaron et al 2003) . Lengthening the inter-exacerbation interval and prevention of early relapse are being increasingly recognized as important clinical goals of treatment, because they ultimately translate to a decrease in the frequency of exacerbations, which is now a major focus of COPD treatment. Though most patients and physicians would accept faster recovery to baseline as a desirable goal of treatment, acceptance of this goal has been hampered by lack of well validated instruments to reliably measure the rate of resolution of exacerbations.",

Recommendations for antibiotic use among published guidelines are often inconsistent, and at times vague (Bach et al 2001; Balter et al 2003; Celli and MacNee 2004; GOLD 2007) . The paucity of well-designed, large randomized controlled trials in this fi eld upon which to base solid recommendations has undoubtedly contributed to the state of affairs (Sethi 2004b) . Recently, a few well designed placebo controlled and antibiotic comparison trials have been reported. In addition, epidemiologic studies have consistently identifi ed certain 'risk factors', the presence of which in a patient with an acute exacerbation is predictive for failure of treatment or early relapse. There is increasing realization that with the heterogeneity of COPD and of exacerbations, using the same antibiotic in all episodes may not provide optimal outcome. It is likely that a proportion of treatment failures in exacerbations are related to ineffective antibiotic treatment. Therefore, patients 'at risk' for poor outcome are the logical candidates for aggressive initial antibiotic treatment, with the expectation that such an approach would improve overall outcomes of exacerbation. This 'risk stratifi cation' approach has also been advocated for other community-acquired infections such as pneumonia and acute sinusitis (Mandell et al 2003; Sinus and Allergy Health 2004) . Though improved outcomes with risk stratifi cation has not yet been demonstrated in prospective controlled trials, such an approach takes into account concerns of disease heterogeneity, antibiotic resistance and judicious antibiotic use in exacerbations.",

Two meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials in exacerbations have been published. In the fi rst such analysis published in 1995, only nine trials met quality criteria and a small but signifi cant benefi cial effect of antibiotics over placebo in acute exacerbation was demonstrated (Saint et al 1995) . In the second analysis, 11 trials were included, and a much larger benefi cial effect on mortality and prevention of clinical failure was demonstrated, especially in moderate to severe exacerbations (Ram et al 2006) . The numbers needed to treat in severe exacerbations in hospitalized patients to prevent one death was only three patients and the number needed to treat for the prevention of one clinical failure was six patients. Diarrhea was the most frequently related adverse effect, with one episode per seven patients treated. Antibiotic treatment was benefi cial in resolving sputum purulence; however benefi ts on lung function and gas exchange were not observed. The different results between the two meta-analyses can be explained in large part by the addition in the later analysis of a study performed in Tunisia that was published in 2003. In this study, 93 patients with exacerbations of severe underlying COPD requiring ventilator support in an intensive care unit were randomly assigned to receive ofl oxacin or placebo in a double blind manner (Nouira et al 2001) . No systemic corticosteroids were administered. Potential respiratory bacterial pathogens were isolated in tracheo-bronchial aspirates in 61% of patients. Ofl oxacin resulted in a dramatic benefi t when compared to placebo, reducing mortality and the need for additional antibiotics by 17.5-fold and 28.4-fold, respectively (Table 4) .",

In this trial, amoxicillin/clavunate was compared with placebo in 414 exacerbations in 369 patients with varying severity of underlying COPD (Allegra et al 2001) . A unique feature of this study was the measurement of primary outcome at 5 days, instead of the traditional 2-3 weeks. Clinical success (including resolution and improvement) was signifi cantly better with the antibiotic, seen in 86.4% of patients, compared with 50.6% in the placebo arm. Greater benefi t with antibiotics as compared to placebo was seen with increasing severity of underlying COPD. Results of the meta-analyses and this study, along with those of the previous classic large placebo-controlled trial conducted by Anthonisen and colleagues show that antibiotics are benefi cial in the treatment of moderate to severe exacerbations (Anthonisen et al 1987; Allegra et al 2001; Nouira et al 2001; Ram et al 2006) . Furthermore, the benefi t with antibiotics is more marked early in the course of the exacerbation, suggesting that antibiotics hasten resolution of symptoms (Allegra et al 2001; . However, there are still important unresolved questions regarding the role of antibiotics in exacerbations. The benefi t of antibiotics in mild exacerbations is unproven and warrants a placebo controlled trial. Whether antibiotics are of benefi t in the treatment of exacerbations when a short course of systemic corticosteroids are co-administered has still not been studied in a large well designed trial. One would suspect that there would be additive benefi ts when both treatments are used over either treatment alone (Wood-Baker et al 2005; Ram et al 2006) .",

As most exacerbations nowadays are treated without obtaining sputum bacteriology, this initial empiric choice often becomes the only choice made for antibiotic use in exacerbations. Results of antibiotic comparison trials should guide the recommendations for appropriate empiric antibiotics in exacerbations. However, though a large number of such trials have been conducted, in the vast majority, antibiotic choice does not appear to affect the clinical outcome. Differences in bacteriological eradication rates are seen, with an apparent dissociation between clinical and bacteriological outcomes (Obaji and Sethi 2001) . This is contrary to expectations that antibiotics with better in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial effi cacy and better pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics should show superiority in clinical outcomes. This paradox is likely related to several short-comings in design of these trials (Table 5 ) (Sethi 2004b ). Many of these defi ciencies are explained by the fact that these trials are performed for regulatory approval of the drugs, therefore are designed for demonstrating noninferiority rather than differences between the two antibiotics.",

The GLOBE (Gemifl oxacin and Long term Outcome of Bronchitis Exacerbations) trial was a prospective, double blind, randomized trial that compared a fl uoroquinolone, gemifl oxacin, with a macrolide, clarithromycin (Wilson et al 2002) . End of therapy and long-term outcome assessments were made at the conventional 10-14 day and 28 day time intervals. In these assessments, in line with most antibiotic comparison trials, there was no statistically significant difference in the two arms in the clinical outcome, with clinical success rates of 85.4% and 84.6% for gemifl oxacin and clarithromycin respectively. Bacteriological success, Undetected bias in use of concurrent therapy measured as eradication and presumed eradication, was signifi cantly higher with gemifl oxacin (86.7%) compared to clarithromycin (73.1%). Patients who had a successful clinical outcome at 28 days were then offered enrollment in a follow up period for a total of 26 weeks of observation. In this time period, the primary outcomes were the rate of repeat exacerbations, hospitalizations for respiratory disease and health-related quality of life measures. Gemifl oxacin was associated with a signifi cantly lower rate of repeat exacerbations, with 71% of the gemifl oxacin-treated patients remaining exacerbation free at 26 weeks in comparison to 58.5% in the clarithromycin arm. The relative risk reduction for recurrence of exacerbation was 30%. The rate of hospitalization for respiratory tract illness in the 26 weeks was also lower in the gemifl oxacintreated patients than in the clarithromycin treated patients (2.3% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.059) (Wilson et al 2002) . Patients who had a recurrent exacerbation in the 26 week period had a lesser improvement in their health-related quality of life when compared to those who remained free of recurrence (Spencer and Jones 2003) . This trial clearly demonstrates the limitation of the conventional medium-term clinical outcomes to demonstrate differences among antibiotics in exacerbations. If the 26 week follow up period had not been instituted, signifi cant differences in clinically relevant outcomes of recurrence of exacerbations and respiratory related hospitalization would have been missed.",

In addition, patients were enrolled when stable to establish a baseline as a comparison to reliably distinguish between clinical improvement and resolution following treatment.

Acute bronchodilator use could be related to the severity of underlying COPD or refl ect the wheezy phenotype of exacerbation that may be less responsive to antibiotic treatment. Many of the risk factors discussed above are continuous in severity, however, certain thresholds have been defi ned in studies that are clinically useful and predictive of poor outcome.

The best studied biomarker of bacterial infection is serum procalcitonin level.

The investigators showed no difference in outcomes in spite of reduction in antibiotic use from 72% to 40% with procalcitonin guidance (Stolz et al 2007) . Though the fi ndings of this study are very interesting, this approach needs to be validated in multi-center trials with varied populations (Martinez and Curtis 2007) . Furthermore, it needs to tested in outpatients with exacerbations, where the majority of exacerbations are treated, patients are not as closely supervised and other supportive care is less rigorous. Only a minority of patients received a fl uoroquinolones in this study, which should have been the antibiotics of choice in these complicated patients, as per the risk stratifi cation discussed above. Therefore, a reasonable speculation is that withholding antibiotics that may not be effective in the fi rst place is likely not to have much of an impact.
