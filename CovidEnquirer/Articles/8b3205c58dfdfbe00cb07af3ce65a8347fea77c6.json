Sadly, it is also similar that too many North American travelers do not seek and/or obtain adequate pre-travel input and intervention, and the results of incomplete preventive interventions can be devastating. 1,2 Leggat's discussions of immunization and malaria prevention are mostly applicable to American travel clinics as well.",

With the ready availability and side effect profile of atovaquone-proguanil, however, many travel medicine clinics are increasingly prescribing this product as the mainstay of malaria protection. Concurrently, there is an emphasis on mosquito avoidance and the use of chemical repellents on exposed skin and insecticides on clothes and bednets. 'Stand by' malaria treatment is not commonly recommended in the United States, and rapid displacement to a site of good medical care is advised for a traveler who might have malaria.",

Notable differences, however, center on the use of both infectious disease specialists and nurses in North American pre-travel consultations rather than primary care physicians and on the non-union of aviation medicine and travel medicine in the United States. Americans' specific pre-travel interventions are also similar to those in Australia, but influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis A vaccines are used more widely for even at-home populations in the United States. As similarities and differences are explored and documented, it is clear that while travel medicine is truly a global specialty, the specific risks and resources vary between sites, and these affect the details of a travel medicine practice.",
