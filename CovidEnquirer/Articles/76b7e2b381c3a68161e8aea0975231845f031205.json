            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a highly lethal respiratory disease caused by a novel single-stranded, positive-sense RNA betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV). Dromedary camels, hosts for MERS-CoV, are implicated in direct or indirect transmission to human beings, although the exact mode of transmission is unknown. The virus was fi rst isolated from a patient who died from a severe respiratory illness in June, 2012, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As of May 31, 2015, 1180 laboratory-confi rmed cases (483 deaths; 40% mortality) have been reported to WHO. Both community-acquired and hospital-acquired cases have been reported with little human-to-human transmission reported in the community. Although most cases of MERS have occurred in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cases have been reported in Europe, the USA, and Asia in people who travelled from the Middle East or their contacts. Clinical features of MERS range from asymptomatic or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure resulting in death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities. No specifi c drug treatment exists for MERS and infection prevention and control measures are crucial to prevent spread in health-care facilities. MERS-CoV continues to be an endemic, low-level public health threat. However, the virus could mutate to have increased interhuman transmissibility, increasing its pandemic potential.",

            "text": "The fi rst report of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) described a patient who died from a severe respiratory illness in a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in June, 2012. A previously unrecognised coronavirus (MERS-CoV) isolated from this patient 1 was similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused an epidemic in 2002-03. The virus was initially designated human coronavirus-EMC, but was renamed MERS-CoV with global consensus. 2 The genomic structure of MERS-CoV was delineated 3 and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) was identifi ed as the host-cell receptor for cell entry. 4 Reverse genetics enabled the virus's genome to be studied, 5, 6 and molecular diagnostic tests were quickly developed. The high mortality rates in family-based and hospital-based outbreaks, especially in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes and renal failure, 7-10 along with the respiratory droplet route of transmission, evoked global concern and intensive discussion in the media. The numbers of reported MERS cases spiked during hospital-based cluster outbreaks in the spring of 2013 and 2014; some cases are still detected throughout the year. MERS-CoV was deemed a serious public health epidemic threat, because millions of pilgrims from 184 countries converge in Saudi Arabia each year for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. Fortunately, no MERS cases were associated with the 2013 and 2014 Hajj pilgrimages.",

Protease cleavage of the S protein is then required for virus-cell fusion and release of genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. Viral RNA transcription and replication occurs on double membrane vesicles and other membranous structures, which are derived from the endo plasmic reticulum. Transcription of the seven subgenomic mRNAs occurs via negative-strand subgenomic RNA intermediates. Subgenomic RNAs are 3\u02b9 co-terminally nested and are joined to a common leader encoded at the 5\u02b9 end of the genome. Viral RNA is encapsidated in the virus replication encoded at the 5\u02b9 end and structural proteins encoded by genes at the 3\u02b9 end of the genome (fi gure 2). 3 Accessory proteins, which are not required for virus viability, are interspersed throughout the structural genes and might interfere with the innate immune response in infected animals. MERS-CoV has fi ve diff erent accessory proteins and SARS-CoV has eight diff erent accessory proteins, which share no sequence similarity. These diff erences, which presumably have diff erent eff ects on induction and signalling of type 1 interferon, could explain why MERS-CoV is more sensitive to interferon than is SARS-CoV. 19, 20 This diff erence in interferon sensitivity has implications for treatment because type 1 interferon has been used to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 21, 22 Coronaviruses have high rates of mutation and recombination and a propensity to cross host species. 18 Although this property was most clearly shown by the spread of SARS-CoV from Chinese horseshoe bats to human populations during the 2002-03 epidemic, other coronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 and bovine coronavirus, or feline coronavirus-II, canine coronavirus-II, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (swine virus) are very closely related, consistent with cross-species transmission. 23 This ability to adapt to new environments raised concerns that MERS-CoV would gain virulence and an enhanced ability to transmit from person to person, but this has not occurred.",

SARS-CoV probably originated in bats [25] [26] [27] and adapted to non-bat variants of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as it crossed species to infect human beings. 28, 29 Changes in the surface glycoprotein enhanced binding to the human receptor. MERS-CoV has not mutated much during transmission in human populations; only a single mutation at position 1020 of the surface protein has been consistently detected in human isolates. 30 This aminoacid is located in a region of the protein involved in fusion to host-cell membranes but not in binding to DPP4. By contrast with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV can bind to DPP4 from several species. 4,31 Thus, non-human primates, rabbits, goats, sheep, and horses, among other animals, are thought to be susceptible to infection in addition to camels and human beings. This diff erence in the role of surface glycoprotein mutation in virus adaptation to new populations is probably a result of subtle diff erences in the mechanism of virus entry: coronavirus entry involves both binding to the receptor and subsequent release of a fusion peptide. The relative importance of each component is diff erent in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. 32 Understanding of the relative roles of receptor binding and protease action will enable prediction of whether specifi c zoonotic coronaviruses will infect human beings and the likelihood of adaptation.",

The latter is a possibility because DPP4 is expressed at high levels in the kidney. 34 Analysis of patient tissue samples is needed for a greater understanding of sites of infection. Unfortunately, no tissue samples are available, largely for cultural and religious reasons, so that much of our understanding of pathogenesis comes from studies of experimentally infected animals. Several animals can be experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, including macaques, marmosets, and camels. Macaques develop mild clinical disease with evidence of infl ammatory cell infi ltration on radiological examination, 35, 36 making them a useful model for non-lethal MERS. By contrast, infected marmosets develop severe interstitial pneumonia. 37 Neutrophil and macrophage infi ltration and alveolar oedema have been reported in infected lung tissue. Infected marmosets are useful models for severe MERS, but these animals are not readily available, limiting their utility. In another study, three camels that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV developed mild rhinitis but not systemic disease. 38 Virus was shed for several days, suggesting that camel-to-camel and camel-toperson spread contributed to the ongoing MERS outbreak.",

            "text": "A small rodent model would be most useful but mice are not susceptible to MERS-CoV. Mice can be sensitised to MERS-CoV infection with an adenovirus-expressing human DPP4. 39 An advantage of this approach is that any strain of mouse can be made susceptible to MERS-CoV. Thus, whereas transduced immunocompetent mice develop only mild or no clinical disease, mice defi cient in type 1 interferon signalling develop more clinical disease and more extensive pathological changes in the lungs. Like infected macaques, these mice are most useful for vaccine and antivirus studies. Mice transgenic for human DPP4 develop severe clinical disease after MERS-CoV challenge, but these mice also develop encephalitis, compromising their utility. 40 Little is known about what constitutes a protective immune response in patients who recover, but based on studies of other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, coordinated innate and adaptive immune responses are needed. 41, 42 MERS-CoV elicits attenuated innate immune responses with delayed pro-infl ammatory cytokine induction in cell culture and in vivo, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] which could contribute to a dysregulated immune response. Similar fi ndings have been reported for patients with SARS: 48 ineff ectual B-cell and T-cell responses with prolonged cytokine expression have been detected in patients with severe disease, whereas a more rapid shutoff of the innate immune response and a potent anti-SARS-CoV antibody response was reported in recovered patients. The anti-SARS-CoV antibody response waned until it was undetectable by 6 years after infection whereas T-cell responses could still be detected. 49 Thus, vaccines that result in only antibody responses will probably be useful in the short term, but might not provide long-term protection against MERS-CoV.",

A retrospective analysis of stored human samples obtained in 2012 from blood donors and abattoir workers in Saudi Arabia showed no evidence of MERS-CoV seroreactivity. 61 By contrast, anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were detected in archived serum samples from dromedary camels obtained in Saudi Arabia in 1993, and the United Arab Emirates in 2003. 57, 62 Furthermore, many camels in Saudi Arabia are imported from east Africa; additional studies [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] showed that serum samples from camels in east, west, and north Africa were positive for MERS-CoV as early as 1992, indicating widespread circulation of MERS-CoV in camel populations for many years.",

In further support of this hypothesis, although seroprevalence in the general populations is 0\u00b715%, 2\u00b73% of camel shepherds and 3\u00b76% of slaughterhouse workers were MERS-CoV-antibody positive. 74 Analyses of human populations in contact with camels in the Horn of Africa, which is a source for many of the camels in Saudi Arabia, might identify seropositive individuals and others who succumbed to infection.",

Most infections resulted from person-to-person spread, emphasising the importance of appropriate contact and droplet precautions to prevent transmission to other patients, health-care workers, and family members. 76 Person-to-person spread in health-care facilities was also implicated in the 2014 MERS-CoV outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Patients that were initially considered primary cases were, on further investigation, found to have been exposed to MERS-CoV-infected patients, generally in health-care facilities. 77 MERS-CoVs isolated from single outbreaks are closely related. 30 Genomic data are most consistent with humanto-human spread accompanied by periodic reintroduction of the virus into human populations. R o for MERS-CoV is generally estimated 78 to be less than 0\u00b77, substantially less than 1\u00b70 associated with epidemic potential, making sustained transmission of the virus unlikely unless it mutates. By comparison, R o for SARS-CoV was more than 1, consistent with sustained transmission during the SARS epidemic. 79, 80 Serious symptomatic disease occurs most often in patients with comorbidities, such as diabetes, renal failure, and underlying immunosuppression. However, patients without underlying diseases can also be infected, although most develop asymptomatic or mild clinical disease. 56, 81, 82 MERS-CoV transmission requires close contact between infected patients and susceptible individuals, but even under these conditions, little transmission has been documented. 56,81-83 Drosten and colleagues 56 showed that the transmission rate from 26 patients to 280 household contacts was roughly 4%. All but one infected contact developed subclinical disease, suggesting that the number of infections in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian peninsula (and Africa) is much greater than reported and lending support to eff orts to increase surveillance in these countries.",

Index or sporadic cases in the fi rst wave in 2013 were older (median age 59 years vs 43 years, p<0\u00b7001), and more likely to have severe disease requiring admission to hospital (94% vs 59%, p<0\u00b7001) than were secondary cases. Only secondary cases had mild disease or asymptomatic infection. 84 On the basis of data related to human-to-human transmission in several clusters, the incubation period has been estimated as more than 5 days, but could be as long as 2 weeks (table). 9 Median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission is 4\u00b70 days (range 0-16, n=62), from onset of symptoms to admission to an intensive care unit is 5\u00b70 (1-15, n=35) , and from onset of symptoms to death is 11\u00b75 days (4-298, n=40). [7] [8] [9] [10] 13, 84 MERS typically begins with fever, cough, chills, sore throat, myalgia, and arthralgia, followed by dyspnoea and rapid progression to pneumonia within the fi rst week, often requiring ventilatory and other organ support. [7] [8] [9] [10] 13, 85 Although most patients with symptomatic disease present with respiratory illness, immuno compromised patients can present with fever, chills, and diarrhoea and later develop pneumonia. 34 Similar to SARS, at least a third of patients with MERS have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhoea. 9,10,84 Risk factors for development of severe disease, in addition to an immunocompromised state, include comorbidity (eg, obesity, diabetes, cardiac disease, and lung disease). [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Concomitant infections and low albumin concentration are predictors of severe illness, and age older than 65 years was associated with mortality in a case series in Saudi Arabia. 85 The few data available about viral dynamics and clinical course suggest that patients with MERS have a shorter time from illness onset to clinical presentation and to a requirement for ventilatory support than do patients with SARS (table), and higher respiratory tract viral loads during the fi rst week of the illness. 92 As for SARS and other severe viral illnesses, common laboratory fi ndings of MERS include leucopenia, particularly lymphopenia (table) . 1, 8, 9, 33, 93 Some patients have a consumptive coagulopathy and high creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzyme concentrations. 7 Chest radiography and tomography fi ndings of MERS are consistent with viral pneumonitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, with bilateral hilar infi ltration, unilateral or bilateral patchy densities or infi ltrates, segmented or lobar opacities, ground-glass opacities, and small pleural eff usions in some cases. Lower lobes are generally aff ected more than are upper lobes early in the course of illness with more rapid radiographic progression than in SARS. 1, 8, 9, 94 Some patients have viral RNA in blood, urine, and stool but at much lower viral loads than in the respiratory tract. 95 MERS-CoV viral loads and genome fractions in upper respiratory tract specimens (eg, nasopharyngeal swabs) are lower than in lower respiratory tract specimens, such as tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid, 92 which probably accounts for the ineffi ciency of interhuman transmission. Lower respiratory tract excretion of MERS-CoV RNA can be detected after 1 month of illness in most patients, suggesting that prolonged shedding could be a source for spread in outbreaks. 96",

MERS can be confi rmed by detection of viral nucleic acid or by serology. The presence of viral nucleic acid can be confi rmed either by positive real-time reverse transcription PCR on at least two specifi c genomic targets or by a single positive target with sequencing of a second positive PCR product. 97 Available real-time reverse transcription PCR tests include an assay targeting RNA upstream of the E gene (upE) and assays targeting open reading frames 1b (ORF 1b) and 1a (ORF 1a). The assay for the upE target is highly sensitive and is recommended for screening; the ORF 1a assay is of equal sensitivity. The ORF 1b assay is less sensitive but is useful for confi rmation. These assays have not shown cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses including human coronaviruses. Two target sites on the MERS-CoV genome suitable for sequencing to aid confi rmation are in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; present in ORF 1b) and N genes (fi gure 2). 97 In MERS cases confi rmed by PCR, serial sampling for PCR testing from the upper and lower respiratory tracts and other body parts (eg, serum, urine, and stool) are recommended to understand viral replication kinetics and to guide infection control. Respiratory samples should be collected at least every 2-4 days to confi rm viral clearance after two consecutive negative results are obtained.",

Evidence-based recommendations for treatment provide the basis for decision making in clinical settings (panel). 100 MERS-CoV is readily inhibited by type 1 interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and especially IFN-\u03b2) in cultured cells, 20, 43 and IFN-\u03b12b combined with ribavirin can lessen lung injury and reduce lung titres when administered to rhesus macaques within 8 h of virus inoculation. 101 This combination was tested in severely ill patients, showing an improvement in survival at 14 days but not 28 days, possibly a result of administration in the advanced stages of disease. 20, 102 Several drugs inhibit MERS-CoV in cell culture, including ciclosporin and mycophenolic acid. 103, 104 Other compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir) inhibit virus replication (eff ective concentration 50 3-8 \u03bcmol/L) in vitro, 105, 106 although whether these drugs will be useful in patients is unknown. MERS-CoV-specifi c peptide fusion inhibitors, which function similarly to the HIV drug enfuvirtide, diminish virus replication in cultured cells, providing a novel approach to MERS treatment. 107 Human monoclonal neutralising antibodies and convalescent sera from recovered patients might be useful for treatment if delivered in a timely fashion. 100, [108] [109] [110] [111] An exploratory post-hoc meta-analysis of studies of SARS and severe infl uenza showed a signifi cant reduction of mortality following antibody treatment compared with placebo or no treatment (pooled odds ratio 0\u00b725, 95% CI 0\u00b714-0\u00b745). 112 Systemic corticosteroids have been used empirically in some patients to dampen immunopathological host responses, although no survival benefi t has been reported. 8, 102 Steroids should be used cautiously, if at all, because their use was associated with worsened outcomes in patients infected with SARS-CoV during the 2002-03 epidemic. 22 More data are needed from animal studies and carefully done clinical and virological studies of priority treatments such as convalescent plasma and interferons (ideally in randomised clinical trials if suffi cient numbers of patients are available). At present, clinical management of patients with severe disease largely relies on meticulous intensive care support and prevention of complications. 100",

Raw urine should not be used for medicinal purposes. 114, 118 Because signs of disease are non-specifi c, it is not possible to know whether an animal in a farm, market, race track, or slaughterhouse is excreting MERS-CoV without virological testing. Camel farm workers, slaughterhouse workers, market workers, veterinarians, and those handling camels at racing facilities should practise good personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing after touching animals, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands, and avoiding contact with sick animals. Consideration should also be given to wearing protective gowns and gloves while handling animals, especially if camels have signs of upper respiratory tract disease. 114 The Saudi Government issues updated health guidelines for pilgrims. 119 Although MERS-CoV did not cause severe community-acquired pneumonia in any of the 38 hospital-admitted pilgrims investigated during the 2013 Hajj, 120 good infectious disease surveillance and control measures are essential to prevent major outbreak of MERS during mass gatherings. 115, 121 ",

Although a zoonotic source of the virus is most likely, the route of transmission could be through either direct or indirect contact, or consumption of a contaminated food or food product. Although several studies have shown the possible links between human cases of MERS and transmission from camels, much is unknown of the origins, geographical distribution, exact mode of transmission, and relationships between MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-like infections in bats, camels, other animals, and human beings. The sporadic nature of many cases of MERS has hindered in-depth case-control studies and investigation of rates of secondary transmission, including establishing the role of subclinical infection in human-to-human transmission. The natural history, pathogenesis, host susceptibility factors, virulence, viral kinetics, period of greatest infectiousness, underlying mechanisms of protective immunity, and factors governing treatment outcome are also unknown. 84 This lack of knowledge is hindering the development of drug treatment, adjunctive treatments, specifi c diagnostic tests, biomarkers, and vaccines.",

More information about how long the virus has infected human beings, which could be obtained from analyses of pre-2012 human serum samples (if available), would help assessment of the likelihood of further adaptation to people. Further genomic studies will provide insights into the molecular characteristics, mutation rates, and virus transmission dynamics, defi ning factors crucial for species specifi city and virulence, and enabling the discovery of new drug targets, novel drugs, diagnostic tests, and vaccines. Postmortem and histological studies have not been available and even limited autopsy or surgical specimens would be useful. The availability of an animal model of severe MERS-CoV infection and disease will be important for understanding patho genesis, natural history, and immune responses, and for developing eff ective treatments. These studies are urgently needed because coronaviruses have high genetic mutability and MERS-CoV continues to circulate in countries in the Arabian peninsula. Although interhuman transmission is still ineffi cient, health authorities, governments, and the research community should be prepared for the emergence of a MERS-CoV with increased capacity for transmission and pandemic potential.",

The virus has circulated in camel populations in Africa and the Arabian peninsula for at least 20 years. In 2012, MERS-CoV spread to human populations, with camels the most likely source. Several possible routes of spread from camels to humans exist. MERS-CoV is believed to be transmitted among human beings by droplet, contact, and perhaps airborne spread. MERS manifests in people in various ways, ranging from asymptomatic to fulminant infections. Patients with underlying disease such as diabetes or kidney or liver disease or who are immunocompromised develop more severe disease and have a higher mortality rate after infection.
