Global Oral Health as a specific discipline is beginning to take shape, with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Dental Federation. The focus for the early part of the twenty-first century, for international oral health, will be dental caries, and the commitment to eradicate dental cavitation (or at least confine to <10%) in the child cohort born in 2026. 1 It is also important to recognize that tropical dentistry is not just dentistry (oral health) in the tropics, but with migration and global travel, oral diseases traditionally restricted in some developing countries have manifested themselves within all areas of the global community. This chapter will cover oral conditions common in all parts of the world, as well as tropical region-specific conditions and risk factors.",

            "text": "Together with the common cold, dental caries is perhaps the most prevalent disease of modern man, but unlike the cold, its effects leave behind defects that are permanent. 1 The general consensus of international epidemiological studies is that nonmilk extrinsic sugars are the most important dietary factor in the aetiology of dental caries. The role of nutrition during tooth development is considered to be minimal in industrialized countries. 2, 3 However, in tropical and subtropical areas where malnutrition is evident, delayed tooth eruption is observed, especially in the primary dentition, 4 but there is inconclusive evidence that malnutrition during tooth development can influence subsequent levels of dental caries. 5 In the last few decades, there has been enormous progress in development, with decreased infant mortality and increased life expectancy, literacy and sanitation in developing countries. Such development is all too often coupled with increasing access to sugars, commonly in the form of confectionery or carbonated drinks. The WHO's global databank on oral health established in 1969, and continuing to monitor dental caries levels across different countries, demonstrates two clear trends: first the ongoing decline in dental caries for the industrialized world and, second, the increasing prevalence of caries in the developing world. 6 The treatment of dental caries has not essentially changed over the past few decades, although tooth cavity design and filling materials have changed the practical approach to dental restorative treatment. The Atraumatic Restorative Technique (ART) has produced promising results in developing countries, especially those with a shortage of suitably qualified manpower. 7 There have been a number of studies that have demonstrated significant caries reduction as a result of fluoride toothpaste. The major barrier to the implementation of fluoride toothpaste to the developing world has been cost; however, the new WHO programmes to introduce locally produced affordable fluoridated toothpaste to many developing countries are producing encouraging results. 8 The evidence base for addressing dental caries in children has been documented and the predictive models and policy options to managing this clarified. 1 It is clear that each health economy needs to document its fluoride policy and preferably adopt either a water fluoridation or improving the child oral health. 1 Cultural habits such as the use of smokeless tobacco are known to have an effect on dental caries. 9 A significantly higher number of cariogenic bacteria are found at the site of smokeless tobacco placement, attributed to the sugar content in these products which enhance the growth of bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans. 10 Although there is some evidence of an association between smokeless tobacco and dental caries, a cause and effect relationship cannot be conclusively established.",

Variations in availability and access to care services are also evident. 16 The incidence of oral cancer varies widely between countries and geographical areas of the world and is generally most common in developing countries, particularly in Asia, though Eastern Europe and France have some of the highest recorded rates globally. Mouth cancer worldwide is the 12th most common cancer but it is the 8th most common in males. 17 Annually, there are 197 000 deaths worldwide from cancer of the mouth and pharynx, with the highest mortality from mouth cancer in Melanesia and South-Central Asia. The gender ratio is 2 : 0 (M : F). Mouth cancer in men is most common in Eastern Europe, South Asia, Melanesia, southern Africa and Australia/ NZ. In females, it is most common in South-Central Asia, Melanesia and Australia/NZ. Lip cancer is particularly common in white Caucasians in the tropics and subtropics. 17 The aetiology of oral cancer has been attributed to specific risk factors: tobacco 18 and/or alcohol in southern Africa, and betel quid in people of South-Central Asian and Melanesian cultures. 19 Smokeless (chewing) tobacco use is an important factor for South Asian populations. The areca (betel) nut habit is important in the development of oral submucous fibrosis and of mouth cancer. Some chew the nut only and others prefer 'paan' , which includes tobacco, and sometimes lime and catechu. Studies from India have confirmed the association between 'paan' tobacco chewing and oral cancer, particularly cancer of the buccal and labial mucosa. There is growing evidence associating increased alcohol consumption with risk of oral cancer. The role of alcohol drinking is observed in a negative social class gradient and for many countries, follows a similar pattern to tobacco use. Finally, there is an increasing predisposition of younger (<45 years) people to oral and pharyngeal cancer in many countries, and in this respect, human papillomaviruses (HPV) are increasingly linked. 20 The molecular changes found in oral carcinomas from Western countries (UK, USA, Australia), particularly p53 mutations, are infrequent in the East (India, South-east Asia), where the involvement of ras oncogenes, including mutation, loss of heterozygosity (H-ras) and amplification (K-and N-ras) are common, suggesting genetic differences.

However, mortality rates for oral cancer have substantially increased in many countries. Although the efficacy of screening for oral cancer to increase survival and reduce mortality remains unproven, it is believed that Cuba's ongoing oral cancer screening programme has resulted in a higher proportion of cancers being localized at diagnosis and a comparatively high survival rate. 22 The WHO has published guidelines on prevention, 23 and studies have shown reduction or reversal in pre-cancerous lesions by primary prevention or abstinence from tobacco.

The saliva produced can be either swallowed or spat out. While habitual users add tobacco to the quid in parts of the Indian subcontinent, this is not the norm in other countries such as Taiwan and Papua New Guinea. 40 In the last few decades, an estimated 20-40% of the Indian, Nepali and Pakistani populations were reported to be habitual users. While trends appear to be changing, with a decrease in the habit in Thailand, this habit is shockingly high in other countries, such as Palauans, where 70-80% of the population use areca nut. Areca nut is not only common throughout Asia but is becoming increasingly widespread in the Western society where these communities have settled. There has been a reported increase in the prevalence of areca nut among the minority immigrant population in the USA and UK. 41 Areca nut with/without tobacco is carcinogenic to humans. It contains about 11-26% tannins and 0.15-0.67% alkaloids, known to be both cytotoxic and genotoxic. It is associated with the development of potentially malignant disorders with high potential for malignant transformation, including oral lichen planus, oral leukoplakia and oral submucous fibrosis. The risk of malignancy further increases with the addition of smokeless tobacco. 42 Lime used in the quid has high concentrations of arsenic, a toxic metal also known to be carcinogenic. 43 Other additional ingredients used are known to cause lichenoid lesions, the premalignant potential of which is not fully understood. While areca nut consumption is associated with oral, pharyngeal and oesophagus cancers (due to p53 gene mutation), and to some extent liver cancers, it is also linked to metabolic syndrome, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis and low-birth-weight infants.

The habit is most prevalent in the south Asian communities and, despite substance control via point of sale legislation, is culturally acceptable among all ages, with the habit commencing from as young as 5 years. 30, 31 Data on the prevalence of this habit in the UK are limited. The Health Survey of England 2004 observed that smokeless tobacco was most widespread among the Bangladeshi community, with a prevalence of 9% in men and 16% in women, followed by Indians (mainly Punjabi and Gujarati; 1-4% in men and 1% in women) and Pakistanis (1-2% in men and 1% in women). 32 This habit is associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, increased heart rate, brain damage from stroke and cancers of the pancreas, stomach, bladder and lungs, decrease in sperm quality, increased risk of stillbirth, decreased gestational age at birth and decreased birth weight independent of gestational age in pregnancy. 33 Different smokeless products have a range of health risks, depending on the ingredients used, varying widely from minor reddish-orange discolouration/staining of teeth to more serious effects including oral birth defects like cleft palate and cancer of the oral cavity. These products contain variable quantities of proven carcinogens such as tobacco-specific nitrosamines, benzo(a) pyrene and toxic metals. Although some users associate it with oral cancers, knowledge of precancerous lesions, such as leukoplakia and oral submucous fibrosis, are relatively low. 34 The risk of pre-cancerous lesions and mouth cancers are known to increase when used as a 'night quid' , i.e. placed in the cheek pouch overnight, combination with other habits such as alcohol and cigarette smoking has a synergic effect, further increasing these risks. 35 Typical lesions, i.e. 'the Indian Oral Cancer' refer to cancer in the buccal mucosal, gingival and retromolar trigonal region, caused by placement of smokeless products in this area. As the name suggests, these patterns are particularly prevalent in southern Asia. Poor oral health is another trait often seen among users, characterized by increased periodontal pocket depth, gingival inflammation and bleeding. 36 While insoluble C and tuberculosis, particularly because it is a shared habit, this evidence is inconclusive. While there is a dearth in the current evidence-base for prevention and treatment of the long-term abstinence of this habit, evidence suggests that hookah users should be made aware of its addictive and harmful effects in order to influence behaviour change. 52 ",

The coca plant is popularly known as the plant responsible for the production of cocaine, globally. The habit of chewing coca leaves has been prevalent since before the Middle Ages and the plant is grown in Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina, Ecuador and Chile. 53 While these leaves have religious connotations and are used as offerings among indigenous communities in the Andean regions, coca leaves are also infused in water and imbibed as tea. Coca users adapt to cold, fatigue, hunger and are able to perform prolonged periods of strenuous physical activity, making the habit more prevalent among manual workers, including farmers and mine workers as well as at high altitudes. 53 Traditionally, the coca leaves are used as a stimulant, as well as for various ailments including gastrointestinal problems, altitude sickness, depression, toothache (for its anaesthetic effects) and obesity. Some of the associated oral ill-effects of coca use are an increased risk of dental attrition, cervical root caries and periapical abscess. 54, 55 Although coca is one of the drugs on the UN's list of prohibited drugs, South American countries such as Bolivia are keen on protecting the indigenous cultural practices among the Andean communities. The use of coca by the indigenous people is comparable with caffeine consumption in Western culture and despite the increased dental health risks, and international disapproval, prohibition of coca is currently under dispute to protect the cultural identity and heritage of these communities.",

            "text": "Dental mutilation, including chipping and filing of teeth as well as intentional extraction of teeth, is a common traditional practice in many African countries, including Tanzania, Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya. Adult dental mutilations, primarily involving the maxillary incisors and canines, have been observed among many African tribes. Evidence from Cameroon suggests six patterns of adult dental mutilation -loss of incisors; inverted V-shaped central incisors; V-shaped central incisors; T-shaped anteriors; rectangular and hourglass-shape of at least one of the anteriors. 56 The tribe-specific adult dental mutilation is a cultural form of beautification and is associated with puberty ceremonies in both sexes, where the inverted V-shaped pattern is particularly observed. Clinical implications of these traditional practices are pulpal exposure, radicular cysts and extensive bone loss of the labial cortical plate. 56 Infant dental mutilations differ from adult dental mutilations, as they are performed for their perceived medicinal benefits, however, they can have devastating health implications leading to death due to sepsis. Two patterns of infant dental mutilations have been observed -extraction of mandibular primary canines; and rarely extraction of permanent mandibular incisors. The strong cultural belief that during infancy, the Areca nut users have poor oral hygiene, halitosis, poor periodontal health with an increase in gingival lesions, recession, periodontal pockets and bleeding of gums. Mild to severe attrition is another common finding among users, in severe cases it can be accompanied by periapical periodontitis and alveolar bone resorption. The severity of attrition is directly proportional to length and frequency of the habit. Although there appears to be little evidence on effective interventions, cessation advice along with behavioural support and counselling may be effective for abstinence from areca nut use. 49 NASWAR Naswar (Nass, niswar, kap) is a form of smokeless tobacco containing powdered tobacco, slaked lime, indigo, cardamom and menthol. It is practised primarily among Central Asian, Afghani, Pakistani, Iranian and also in some Swedish and South African communities. Typically, it is used by sniffing through the nose, but is also used orally by placing a pinch under the tongue or in the buccal vestibule.",

Most noma sufferers are under 6 years of age and it has been estimated that the case-fatality rate is probably between 70% and 90%. It is estimated that 100 000 African children under the The lip is the most common extragenital site of primary infection with Treponema pallidum. It causes a chancre (primary, hard or Hunterian chancre) which begins as a small, firm, pink macule, changes to a papule and then ulcerates to form a painless round ulcer with a raised margin and indurated base ( Figure  73 .5). About 60% of oral cases affect the lip or may present at the angles of the mouth. 64 Other oral sites affected may include the tongue and to a lesser extent the gingivae and fauces. Lymph nodes in the submaxillary, submental and cervical regions are usually enlarged. Chancres heal spontaneously within 3-8 weeks. Secondary syphilis follows the primary stage after 6-8 weeks but a healing chancre may still be present. As in the primary stage, the mucosal lesions are highly infectious. The typical signs and symptoms are fever, headache, malaise, a rash (characteristically symmetrically distributed coppery maculopapules or lesions on the palms) and generalized painless lymph node enlargement. It is this stage that classically causes oral lesions. Painless oral ulcers (mucous patches and snail-track ulcers) are the typical lesions and are slightly raised, greyish white, glistening patches seen on the fauces, soft palate, tongue, buccal mucosa and, rarely, gingivae. Cervical nodes are enlarged and 'rubbery' in consistency. Latent syphilis follows secondary syphilis and persists until late syphilis (tertiary syphilis) develops. The characteristic lesion of tertiary syphilis is a localized midline granuloma ('gumma') varying in size from millimetres to several centimetres, which breaks down to form a deep punched-out painless ulcer. The most common oral site for a gumma is the hard palate although the soft palate, lips or tongue are commonly involved. The gumma starts as a small, pale, raised area which ulcerates and rapidly progresses to a large zone of necrosis with denudation of bone and, in the case of a palatal gumma, may eventually perforate into the nasal cavity. 65 The presence of clinical manifestations together with a history of contact may suggest the diagnosis but serodiagnostic tests, and sometimes dark-field microscopy is required for confirmation. There is no specific oral management except general palliative care if there is soreness of oral soft lesions, but the age of 6 years contract noma every year. 62 Factors which predispose to the development of gangrenous stomatitis include protein-energy malnutrition and deficiencies of vitamins A, B, C, iron or magnesium. Therefore, poor living environment, exposure to debilitating childhood diseases, poor oral hygiene and malnutrition all appear to put children at risk for noma. In the developed world, gangrenous stomatitis is rare, and typically seen in immunocompromised persons such as those with HIV infection, leukaemia and diabetes. 63 The condition is seen especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria probably has the highest incidence, although The Gambia, Algeria, Uganda, Senegal, Madagascar, South Africa, Sudan and Egypt are also areas of high prevalence, as are Afghanistan, India, the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea and South America.",

Primary tuberculosis of the mouth is more common in children and adolescents than adults. It usually presents as a single painless indolent ulcer commonly on the gingiva with enlarged cervical lymph nodes, or the gingivae, tooth extraction sockets and the buccal folds. Occasional cases of primary jaw tuberculosis have been reported, usually resulting from extension of a gingival lesion, from an infected post-extraction socket, from an extension from a tuberculous granuloma at the apex of the tooth or haematogenous spread. Tuberculous osteomyelitis may involve the maxilla particularly, or the mandible. The same general pattern as seen in other affected bones is common, with a slow rarefying osteitis resulting in sequestration of bone. Pain is not a prominent early feature but is seen later. Secondary infection may lead to difficulty in making a diagnosis. Tuberculous involvement of the mandible causes symptoms of pain, swelling, difficulty in eating, trismus, paraesthesia of the lower lip and enlargement of the regional lymph nodes. The infection may spread throughout the jaw, producing multiple sinuses, which drain intra-or extra-orally. The posterior mandible and ascending ramus are typically affected, and radiographical appearances include irregular linear calcifications along the lower border and irregular radiolucencies within the jawbone. In the maxilla the infra-orbital region, particularly in the young, is the usual site affected. Typically, a cold abscess develops and may eventually drain through fistulae but occasionally a firm intra-bony lesion may be present. TB in AIDS may affect the salivary glands. [69] [70] [71] The diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, suggested by a chronic cough, haemoptysis, loss of weight, night sweats and fever, is confirmed by physical examination, chest radiography, sputum smears and culture, and tuberculin testing (Mantoux or Heaf test). A lesional biopsy should be examined histologically, and with acid-fast stains and culture of the organism is the absolute proof of the disease.",
