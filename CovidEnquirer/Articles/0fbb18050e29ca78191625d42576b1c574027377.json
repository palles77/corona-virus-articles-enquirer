Enabling testing outside of sophisticated laboratories broadens the scope of control and surveillance efforts, but also requires robust and simple methods that can be used without expensive instrumentation. Here we report a method to identify SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT-qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection. This simple and sensitive method provides an opportunity to facilitate virus detection in the field without a requirement for complex diagnostic infrastructure.",

The diagnostics industry has responded rapidly, with Emergency Use Authorization granted for PCR-based tests from the US CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html), Seegene in Korea and BGI in China (https://www.bgi.com/global/company/news/bgi-develops-realtime-dna-based-kit-for-detecting-the-2019-novel-coronavirus/) among many other providers releasing reagents, primers and probes, and other materials to support this urgent public health need. The current diagnostic standard combines clinical symptoms and molecular method, and as many of the symptoms resembles those of common cold and influenza, an accurate molecular result is critical for final diagnosis. These molecular methods include metagenomics sequencing mNGS (1) and RT-qPCR(2), both are excellent and sensitive techniques, but approaches not without limitations. mNGS is restricted by throughput, turnover time, formidable high cost and requirement for high technical expertise. As with most molecular diagnostics, RT-qPCR is the most widely used method, but it requires expensive laboratory instruments and is difficult to utilize outside of well-equipped facilities. In combination to the different patient samples containing variable number of virus, a high proportion of patients were diagnosed as false negatives (3, 4) .",

Since the initial description of LAMP, a number of advancements in detection technology have helped establish LAMP as a standard method for simple isothermal diagnostics.

To evaluate detection sensitivity, synthetic RNAs were serially diluted from ~120 million copies down to ~120 copies (per 25 \u03bc L reaction) at 10fold intervals in LAMP reactions. All five primer sets showed similar detection sensitivity and could consistently detect as low as a few hundred copies, with sporadic detection of 120 copies (or 4.8 copies/\u03bcL; Fig. 1 ). The results from colorimetric detection were 100% in agreement with the real time detection. To estimate the relative efficiency using RNA or DNA templates, we compared synthetic RNA with similarly diluted gBlock dsDNA on real-time LAMP signal (Fig. 2) . For the 2 primer sets we compared, one showed slightly slower amplification and detection with RNA template while the other appeared slightly faster, confirming the RNA is efficiently converted to cDNA by the reverse transcriptase (WarmStart RTx) and subsequently amplified via LAMP by the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (Bst 2.0 WarmStart).",

The results indicated that ~480 copies were detected with all four primer sets, a similar sensitivity as the detection sensitivity with synthetic RNA alone (Fig. 3A) with no interference by the lysate to either the amplification efficiency or visual color change. We also tested whether we could recover the synthetic RNA spiked into biological sample with a mock experiment during purification of total RNA. We spiked various amount of synthetic RNA into whole human blood and purified the total blood RNA. We were able to recover and detect the spiked RNA (Fig. 3B) , indicating the total RNA has no interference during the purification or the detection process.

RNA was extracted from swabs using the standard laboratory protocol (see Materials and Methods) and RNA tested in colorimetric RT-LAMP alongside a commercial RT-qPCR assay. In addition to controls, a total of 7 patient RNA samples were tested, 6 of which were determined to be positive by RT-qPCR using ORF1a primers (C q 25-36.5, Table 2 ) and 4 positive with Gene N primers. One sample was negative by both RT-qPCR primer sets. When these samples were tested in the colorimetric LAMP assay, all 6 RT-qPCR positive samples showed visible color change indicating positive amplification, while the single RT-qPCR negative samples maintained pink color and was judged negative (Figure 4 ). Thus the colorimetric LAMP assay showed 100% agreement with the RT-qPCR results across a range of C q values. Although a small number of samples were tested here, the colorimetric LAMP assay enables reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection without sophisticated instrumentation, matching the RT-qPCR performance in field and point-of-care settings.",

Not only purified RNA can be used as the sample input, but also direct tissue or cell lysate may be used without an RNA purification step. This combination of a quick sample preparation method with an easy detection process may allow the development of portable, field detection in addition to a rapid screening for point-of-need testing applications. This virus represents an emerging significant public health concern and expanding the scope of diagnostic utility to applications outside of traditional laboratories will enable greater prevention and surveillance approaches. The efforts made here will serve as a model for inevitable future outbreaks where the use of next generation portable diagnostics will dramatically expand the reach of our testing capabilities for better healthcare outcomes.",

Research on developing new diagnostic techniques for COVID-19 using clinical samples has been approved by the ethical committee of Wuhan Institute of Virology. Briefly, respiratory specimens (swabs) collected from patients admitted to various Wuhan health care facilities were immediately placed into sterile tubes containing 3ml of viral transport media (VTM).
