Although dromedaries are the main reservoir, other animal species might be susceptible to MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection and potentially serve as reservoirs. To determine whether other animals are potential reservoirs, we inoculated MERS-CoV into llamas, pigs, sheep, and horses and collected nasal and rectal swab samples at various times. The presence of MERS-CoV in the nose of pigs and llamas was confirmed by PCR, titration of infectious virus, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization; seroconversion was detected in animals of both species. Conversely, in sheep and horses, virus-specific antibodies did not develop and no evidence of viral replication in the upper respiratory tract was found. These results prove the susceptibility of llamas and pigs to MERS-CoV infection. Thus, the possibility of MERS-CoV circulation in animals other than dromedaries, such as llamas and pigs, is not negligible.",

            "text": "(MERS-CoV) first emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and is currently a worldwide concern (1). As of September 21, 2016, the World Health Organization had confirmed \u22481,800 MERS cases and 643 associated deaths (2) . Although during most reported outbreaks the virus is mainly transmitted by human-to-human contact, infection through contact with dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaries) plays a major role in the primary cases. In the Middle East and some countries from East Africa where MERS is endemic, high prevalence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in dromedaries has been reported (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Moreover, a recent surveillance study in Saudi Arabia demonstrated that MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans were also detected in the upper respiratory tract of dromedaries of several geographic origins, indicating that the virus did not require mutations to jump between species (8) . However, not all index cases can be explained by direct contact with dromedaries, and transmission from other domestic livestock or animal species to humans cannot yet be ruled out. Recently, evidence that alpacas (Vicugna pacos) were also susceptible to MERS-CoV infection was provided and confirmed by field studies performed in Qatar (9) (10) (11) . In contrast, despite the ability of the virus to infect a plethora of cell lines and tissues from mammals of multiple species in vitro (12) , serologic surveys of ruminants and horses did not conclusively determine circulation of MERS-CoV among these domestic animals (6, 13, 14) . Sampling design could explain negative results, and experimental infections provide, in many instances, a more straightforward answer to virus host susceptibility. This knowledge is crucial for determining risk factors with regard to possible globalization of the disease.",

These animals shed infectious virus until postinoculation days 4 (pigs) and 7 (llamas), although titers were lower among pigs. In pigs and llamas, we detected virus predominantly in the nasal respiratory epithelium by IHC, ISH, or both, similar to what has been documented in dromedary camels (16) and alpacas (9) . Accordingly, we mainly detected viral RNA, as assessed by RT-qPCR, in the nose, trachea, and bronchi of those animals. We also detected viral RNA in lung tissue from 2 of 4 pigs euthanized at postinoculation day 2. Virus shedding in dromedary camels and alpacas for longer periods, up to 14 days after experimental inoculation, has been reported (9, 16, 19 nose of dromedaries seems to be much higher (16, 19) than that of other animal species described so far, suggesting a more prominent role of dromedaries in transmission of MERS-CoV to humans. Differences in virus susceptibility and pathogenicity between animals of different species could be explained by a distinct tissue distribution of DPP4, the MERS-CoV receptor. In our study, llamas and pigs displayed a similar DPP4 distribution in the respiratory tract, comparable with that of dromedary camels (15) . In contrast, DPP4 was barely detected in the respiratory tract of sheep, probably accounting for the lack of infection reported here. These results are in concordance with those reported by Adney et al., that MERS-CoV experimentally inoculated sheep showed no clinical disease and that only small amounts of virus were detected in nasal swab samples (20) . Differences in susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection and level of virus excretion might also result from host factors associated with innate immunity. Surprisingly, horses were not susceptible to MERS-CoV despite high expression and wide distribution of the virus receptor along the respiratory tract. Moreover, the receptor binding domain, and in particular key amino acids on the docking site, are identical in horses and humans (21) . Although human, camel, and horse DPP4 served as potent and nearly equally effective MERS virus receptors (22) , horses were not productively infected by the strain of MERS-CoV used in this study. Detection of low levels of viral RNA in nasal swab samples until postinoculation day 2 can be attributed to residual inoculum. Similarly, a recent study with horses also showed low levels of MERS-CoV excretion and no virus neutralizing antibodies (20) .",

In that respect, PAS staining revealed differences in the number of goblet cells in the lining epithelium and mucus covering epithelial surfaces, which may have impeded the binding of the virus to the respiratory epithelium of horses. Also, virus tends to bind more to ciliated or nonciliated non-mucus-producing cells and, in proportion, these cells may be fewer in horses than in llamas and pigs. However, it is possible that the guttural pouch empyema, which most likely was of bacterial origin (probably Streptococcus spp.), may have influenced mucus production in the horses.

To implement optimal serologic surveillance in countries where MERS is and is not endemic, identifying which animal species might be potential reservoirs for MERS-CoV, besides dromedaries, is crucial. The finding that pigs can be infected with MERS-CoV suggests that other members of the family Suidae could be susceptible to the virus, such as common warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus), bushpigs (Potamochoerus Figure 5 .

Indeed, these animals are commonly found in the Greater Horn of Africa or the Middle East, sharing territories and water sources with dromedaries. Thus, members of the family Suidae might merit inclusion in MERS surveillance programs. Further studies need to be done to investigate MERS-CoV transmission within and among species to provide a better understanding of the role of potential reservoirs during an outbreak. Moreover, studies comparing the innate immunity of horses with susceptibility of other animal species (i.e., dromedary camels, alpacas, llamas, or pigs) are needed.",

In pigs, high levels of MERS-CoV RNA were demonstrated until postinoculation day 4 and started decreasing at postinoculation day 7; only 1 animal remained positive at postinoculation day 10 (Figure 1, panel A). We subsequently tested positive nasal swab samples for the presence of infectious virus. During the experiment, 7 of 8 llamas and 7 of 14 pigs excreted infectious virus during at least 1 day from postinoculation day 2 on. We detected infectious virus until postinoculation day 4 in pigs and postinoculation day 7 in llamas (Figure 1, panel B). Relatively low levels of viral RNA were detected only until postinoculation day 2 in 5 of 8 inoculated horses and only at postinoculation day 1 in 7 of 14 sheep, suggesting the presence of residual inoculum in these animals (data not shown).
