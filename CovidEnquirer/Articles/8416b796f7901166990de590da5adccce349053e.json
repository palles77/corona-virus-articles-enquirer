We have investigated the entry pathway of EAV into Baby Hamster Kindey cells (BHK). Infection of cells assessed by the plaque reduction assay was strongly inhibited by substances which interfere with clathrin-dependent endocytosis and by lysosomotropic compounds. Furthermore, infection of BHK cells was suppressed when clathrin-dependent endocytosis was inhibited by expression of antisense RNA of the clathrin-heavy chain before infection. These results strongly suggest that EAV is taken up via clathrin-dependent endocytosis and is delivered to acidic endosomal compartments.",

            "text": "Two major cell entry pathways, the endosomal and the nonendosomal pathway, are known for enveloped virus to deliver the viral genome into the target cell. In both cases the release of the viral genome requires fusion of the viral envelope with the respective target membrane of the host cell, the endosomal or the plasma membrane. Membrane fusion is mediated by a conformational change of viral proteins. For viruses utilizing the non-endosomal pathway (Marsh and Helenius, 2006) , like Retroviruses (HIV-1) and Paramyxoviruses (e.g. Sendai virus) the conformational change of the viral glycoproteins is induced by interaction with the receptor of the host cell surface, thereby triggering fusion between the viral envelope and the plasma membrane. In the case of viruses which are taken up by cells via the endosomal pathway (Marsh and Helenius, 2006) , acidification of late endosomal lumen by the proton pump activity of V-type ATPases (Perez and Carrasco, 1994) is essential for activating the fusion competence of viral glycoproteins. The low pH triggers the conformational change either directly as for example for the glycoprotein hemagglutinin of influenza virus (Orthomyxoviruses) or indirectly by activation of endosomal proteases cleaving the ectodomain of the viral glycoprotein to enable the structural transition into a fusion competent state. The latter mechanism has been described for the fusion mediating S-protein of SARS virus (Coronaviruses) (Simmons et al., Virology 377 (2008) . Recently, it has been shown for Avian Sarcoma/Leucosis virus (ASLV) that the conformational change of fusion mediating protein requires both receptor priming and low pH (Mothes et al., 2000) .",

Activation of the antisense RNA causes a block of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

For control cells (tc+), N was detected after 2h p.i. and much stronger after 24h p.i. (Fig. 1B) . Similar observations were made for BHK-21 cells (not shown). We surmise that N after 2h p.i. originated from uncoated, disassembled viruses in infected cells rather than from expression of new proteins, while N detected after 24h p.i. corresponded to newly expressed proteins. For cells expressing anti-CHC (tc\u2212) N protein was observed neither 2h p.i nor 24h p.i. (Fig. 1B) showing that inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis prevents cell infection. To confirm the result we performed an infectivity assay. The BHKasc cells were preincubated in the presence (tc+) and absence (tc\u2212) of tetracycline. In the latter case antisense RNA against clathrin heavy chain is expressed suppressing clathrin-dependent endocytosis. A. Alexa Fluor 633 transferrin uptake.

The low pH compartment might be required to expose EAV to acid-dependent proteases, i.e. to cathepsins. It has recently been reported that cathepsins cleave the S-protein of SARS (Simmons et al., 2005) and gp1 of Filoviruses (Chandran et al., 2005; Brindley et al., 2007) and that this cleavage is required to facilitate the acid-dependent conformational change required to activate the fusion capacity of those proteins. To explore whether proteases of the late acidic compartments may play a role in fusion activation of EAV, we measured infection of BHK-21 cells upon incubation with leupeptin and E64d, which have been shown to inhibit acidic proteases in the endosomal compartment. Leupeptin is a competitive inhibitor of serine and cysteine proteases, while E64d is an irreversible cysteine protease inhibitor. We did not observe any influence on EAV infection up to concentrations of 100 \u00b5M leupeptin and 10 \u00b5M E64d appropriate concentrations formerly used for inhibition of those proteases (Qiu et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2005) (data not shown). However, before conclusive results on this issue can be made further studies are warranted to demonstrate that inhibitors indeed are efficient to suppress endosomal proteases.",

This is supported by our observation of a strong inhibition of infection of BHK cells when viruses were preincubated at pH b 6.0 (Fig. 4) . The irreversible loss of infectivity upon low pH treatment resembles the behaviour of other enveloped viruses which requires an acidic pH for infection of host cells such as Influenza viruses (Earp et al., 2005) . The fusion mediating glycoprotein hemagglutinin of the Influenza virus A undergoes a conformational change at acidic pH and elevated temperatures (Korte et al., 1999; Puri et al., 1990) . This conformational change is irreversible and abolishes the fusion activity and, thus, the infectivity of influenza viruses. Infection of cells by SV5 was not affected by low pH preincubation of viruses (Fig. 4) . It is known that the conformational change of the fusion mediating F protein of Parainfluenza viruses is triggered by interaction with cellular receptors but not by acidic pH (Lamb and Kolakofsky, 2001) .",

While without low pH incubation infection was almost completely abolished (Fig. 5) as expected (see above) we observed a very strong infection when virus-cell complexes were exposed to low pH. These experiments support that low pH triggers fusion of EAV viruses. Remarkably, infection was four to six folds higher in comparison to infection of cells not treated with inhibitors (control, without low pH incubation). Obviously, the low pH incubation was much more efficient in activating the infection Fig. 4 . Influence of preincubation at acidic pH.

To assess the role of cholesterol in EAV entry, BHK-21 cells were depleted of cholesterol by preincubation with methyl-betacyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD, see Materials and methods). At concentrations N5 mM M\u03b2CD EAV infection was completely blocked (Fig. 6A) . Furthermore, treatment of cells with filipin III which is known to form complexes with cholesterol in membranes abolished EAV infection (Fig. 6B) . As a control BHK-21 cells were infected with VSV, which enters cells independently of cholesterol and/or rafts (Guyader et al., 2002) . Indeed, cholesterol depletion of the BHK-21 cells by M\u03b2CD (Fig. 6A) or treatment of cells with filipin III (Fig. 6B ) did not diminish infection by VSV. Notably, we found a slightly enhanced infectivity of VSV upon filipin III treatment.",

Since the inhibitory effect of cholesterol depletion could be overcome by low pH-bypass (Fig. 5) we conclude that cholesterol depletion inhibits virus uptake but not binding of viruses to cells. Cholesterol is strongly engaged in the clathrin- (Rodal et al., 1999; Subtil et al., 1999) as well as in the caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway (Yumoto et al., 2006) . Because inhibition of expression of the clathrin-heavy chain completely blocked infection (see above) the caveolae-dependent endocytic entry plays no role in EAV uptake.

Low pH is essential for infection of the cell. Since we have no indication that proteases of this late compartment are essential for infection, we surmise that low pH is required to trigger a conformational change of the structural virus protein mediating fusion. Alternatively, it might be that EAV in principle can fuse at neutral pH, but its cellular receptor is rapidly endocytosed and subsequent acidification in the endosome is required to release virus particles from the receptor. Although the structural proteins of the EAV envelope have been identified, it is not yet known which of the protein(s) is (are) responsible for mediating fusion. The Gp2b/Gp3/ Gp4 complex is currently a prime candidate for the membrane-fusion activity of EAV (Wieringa et al., 2003 (Wieringa et al., , 2004 .",

As shown recently mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) belonging to Coronavirus family may use different routes for cell entry. While MHV-A59 is taken up via clathrindependent endocytosis (Eifart et al., 2007) , non-endocytic internalisation has been described for MHV-4 (JHM) and MHV-S4 ( (Nash and Buchmeier, 1997; Kooi etal., 1991) . The entry pathway of EAV shares similarities with that of another Arteriviruses, the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV). It has been shown that PRRSV enters cells via receptor-mediated and low pH-dependent endocytic pathway through a pH-dependent mechanism like we have described here for EAV (Kreutz and Ackermann, 1996; Nauwynck et al., 1999) . Kreutz and Ackermann (1996) found that infection of a monkey kidney cell line by PRRSV was strongly inhibited in the presence of 20 \u00b5M cytochalasin B pointing to an involvement of active transport of PRRSV containing endocytic vesicles by microfilaments. Lysosomotropic agents such as ammonium chloride and bafilomycin A1 suppressed PRRSV infection of those cells at concentrations similar to that used in our study. Taken together, these results suggest that viruses belonging to the family Arteriviridae enter cells via a similar endocytic route.",

Cells were fixed at different time points post infection by PBS containing 3% formaldehyde, subsequently quenched with 100 mM glycin, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and then incubated with the primary mouse monoclonal antibody against EAV nucleocapsid protein (VMRD Inc., Pullman USA) (Deregt et al., 1994) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, cells were incubated with the appropriate TRITC labelled secondary antibody against mouse IgG developed in goat (Sigma, Hannover, Germany). Coverslips were obtained from Marienfeld (Germany). Confocal fluorescence microscopy was done with an Olympus FV-1000.",

Prior to the experiment the culture medium was gently removed from the cells and exchanged against transferrin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 633 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) (10\u00b5g/ml final concentration) diluted medium (GM). Immediately after adding of the marker dilution to the cells were incubated for 1h at 37\u00b0C and images were taken. Confocal and phase contrast images were acquired with a Zeiss laser scanning microscope LSM510 Meta mounted on an Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope using a 63\u00d7 phase contrast oil immersion plan-apochromat objective NA1.4. Visualization of transferrin uptake was performed under identical conditions for the tc+ and tc\u2212 cells.",
