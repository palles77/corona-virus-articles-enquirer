The most common primary site of choroidal metastases in males is the lung and in females the breast.

We recognize that in many cases, specific infectious causes may be under-represented, because the changes seen in infectious uveitis can be non-specific making it impossible to make a specific diagnosis based on histopathological findings alone. The morphologic features of uveitis associated with diabetic cataract include: -Protein exudation in the anterior chamber and vitreous -A histiocyte-rich cellular infiltrate in the uvea -Histiocytic inflammatory cells on the inner retinal surface and extending into the retina.\u2022 There are five cases in the COPLOW archive, all in diabetic and hyperlipidemic Miniature Schnauzers \u2022 All five dogs had a history, or other evidence, of chronic uveitis and secondary glaucoma\u2022 Morphologic features of intraocular xanthogranuloma include: \u25a0 On gross inspection, distorted, firm globes, that appear to be essentially filled with a solid, heterogeneous, light tan mass \u25a0 The intraocular structures are effaced by a mixture of lipid-laden macrophages ('foam cells'), and Alcian bluepositive, birefringent crystals \u25a0 Atherosclerosis of episcleral blood vessels.",
