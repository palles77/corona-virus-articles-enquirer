The EB4 gene was inserted at the terminal end of the CGMMV coat protein (CP) open reading frame (ORF). Read-through sequences of TMV or CGMMV, CAA-UAG-CAA-UUA, or AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA were, respectively, inserted in between the CP and the EB4 genes. The chimeric clones, pRT, pRG, and pCG+FSRTRE, were transcribed into full-length capped recombinant CGMMV transcripts. Only constructs with the wild-type CGMMV read-through sequence yielded infectious viruses following infection of host plant, muskmelon (Cucumis melo) leaves. The ratio of modified to unmodified CP for the read-through expression clone developed was also found to be approximately 1:1, higher than what has been previously reported. It was also observed that infectivity was not affected by differences in pI between the chimera and its wild counterpart. Analysis of recombinant viruses after 21-days-postinculation (dpi) revealed that deletions occurred resulting in partial reversions of the viral population to near wild type and suggesting that this would be the limiting harvest period for obtaining true to type recombinants with this construct.",

This method has been exploited in vaccine production, where small foreign peptides are expressed as a fusion with the viral coat proteins. Essentially, an insertion site has to be determined in the virus genome so that the resulting product will be displayed on the surface of the virus particle which is then propagated in plants and consequently isolated and used as antigen presenting vehicles [5, 6] . Modifications that do not interfere with the normal functions of the particular virus are a prerequisite for this peptide fusion approach. One strategy suggests that foreign gene segments could be fused to the terminus of a viral gene in a way that permits the production of both the fusion product and the native viral protein, thus avoiding interference with normal gene functions. The success of this epitope presentation strategy depends on a detailed knowledge of virus structure at the atomic level, which is only available for a limited number of viruses.",

CGMMV is a tobamovirus with a genome size of \u223c6. 4 kb which has been well characterized both biologically [8, 9] and structurally [10, 11] . In this study, a truncated dengue virus type 2 envelope (E) protein binding region from amino acid 379 to 423 (EB4) was inserted into the end of the coat protein (CP) open reading frame (ORF) of a previously constructed CGMMV fulllength clone, pCGT7X [7] . The antigenic peptide was chosen based on a recent study that suggests its importance in enabling dengue virus to bind to specific host cell receptors (S. Abu Bakar personal communication). The present study explores the possibility of extrapolating the CGMMV antigenic epitope presentation system for developing diagnostics Figure 1 : Position of primers in constructed plasmid clones. Primers 4-8 were used to amplify the EB4 gene from pCANTAB 5E. Plasmid pCGT7X and amplified EB4 fragments were digested with HindIII and ligated together to obtain the respective plasmid clones as shown. HindIII is the insertion site of EB4 at the end of CGMMV CP. PCR amplification using primer pairs 1-9, 3-9, and 2-7 will yield amplified products of approximately 6.5 kb, 0.85 kb, and 2.2 kb, respectively. and potentially therapeutics against dengue. The study was also used to challenge the size limits of foreign gene insertion into the CGMMV vector as in the previous study the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) used was only 33 amino acids [7] .",

The resulting amplified products (\u223c6.5 kb) consisted of a T7 promoter fused with the chimeric CGMMV genome carrying EB4. Transcripts produced from the two constructs were separately tested for infectivity by inoculating the host plants. After repeated attempts, both the pRT-and pRG-generated transcripts did not cause infection of the inoculated plants (Table 1 ). There was no evidence of virus genomic material in the inoculated plant tissues tested (data not shown). It is speculated that the read-through sequence of TMV may not be suitable for the CGMMV chimeric clones, hence contributing to the absence of infectious virus transcripts. To overcome this possibility, another chimeric clone (pCG+FSRTRE) was constructed using the read-through sequence AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA of the wild-type CGMMV itself ( Figure 1 ). The template for in vitro transcription, based on the pCG+FSRTRE clone, was generated through LD-PCR. The in vitro transcription products ( Figure 2) were used in inoculation studies. The new leaves of plants (Table 1 and Figure 3 ). Infection could be detected through RT-PCR when total RNA of new noninoculated leaf was used as template. Detection of the virus by RT-PCR ( Figure 4 ) suggests that the viruses had moved from the inoculated leaf to new leaves. This implies that the chimeric virus pCG+FSRTRE carrying the read-through sequence from the CGMMV genome (AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA) was infectious and that the virus particles were able to assemble. The plants, however, continued to grow without any further noticeable symptoms. Virus particles were extracted from the infected plants and an aliquot was electrophoretically separated on 15% SDS-PAGE ( Figure 5 ) resulting in two distinct suggesting that the virus population consisted of two species of coat proteins, the EB4-CP fusion (larger in size) and the wild-type CGMMV CP (smaller in size). The ratio of modified to unmodified CP was approximately 1:1.",

It was also reported that TMV was more tolerant to positively charged epitopes on its surface. Thus, it was initially speculated that the failure in expression of the foreign peptide was possibly due to the pI:charge value of recombinant CGMMV CP which was different from the wild-type CGMMV CP pI:charge value ( Table 2) . Table 2 shows the isoelectric point (pI) and charge of the wild-type CGMMV CP, the read-through recombinant CGMMV CP, and the EB4 insert. The charge of the EB4 insert is positive and potentially suitable for expression on the surface of the CGMMV CP [2] . Hence, the inserted peptide is speculated to be expressed if the pI:charge value of modified virus CP resembles the pI:charge value of unmodified virus CP.

            "text": "Plant virus vectors-based expression systems have been widely studied for their development as antigen presentation systems as well as for the production of pharmaceutically important peptides. The CGMMV has been previously shown to be suitable for expression of foreign peptide [7] . In this study, CGMMV vector was used to express a 45 amino acid EB4 gene. The integration of the EB4 gene into the end of CGMMV coat protein gene was done via a leaky UAG read-through sequence. Transcripts generated from chimeric clones of pRT and pRG carrying CAA-UAG-CAA-UUA read-through codon sequences were not infectious. This is possibly caused by the failure of self assembly [16] , and thus none of the inoculated plants was systemically infected. The assembly of CGMMV into virus particle has been shown to be essential for the viral movement through phloem [17] , hence another chimeric clone pCG+FSRTRE was constructed carrying read-through sequence (AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA) from the wild-type CGMMV genome. The clone containing this read-through signal was infectious and produced chimeric CGMMV (Table 1 and Figures 4 and 5) . It is, thus, postulated that there is a read-through signal preference between different species of tobamoviruses, in this case between TMV and CGMMV causing possibly viral particle assembly failure. It has also been shown that KGMMV, the tobamovirus, which has the closest genome similarity to CGMMV [13] also utilizes the same CGMMV read-through signal reaffirming the differences between the tobamoviruses. Additionally, unlike other plant virus vectors [15, 18] , this study reaffirms that with CGMMV pI deviation did not appear to be a factor affecting infectivity [7] .",

However, in this study, relatively high levels of chimeric coat protein was observed ( Figure 5 ) giving a ratio of modified to unmodified CP of approximately 1:1. It has been suggested that muskmelon host plant could be producing higher levels of translation nonsense suppressor tRNA making the application of the translation read-through signal favorable in this host [7] .",

In this study, it is shown that the EB4 gene sequence carried by the chimeric CGMMV was systemically removed during the infection process. The order of the removal of the transgene was speculated to be the 5 to 3 direction ( Figures  6 and 7) . This is further supported by the detection of two additional nucleotides together with the read-through sequence \"CC-AAA-TAG\" downstream from the CGMMV CP ORF. This report shows the temporal in-host truncation of the transgene from a chimeric virus in a natural host. Recent report has shown truncation occurring in transgenic plants expressing the same or similar transgenes as the chimeric virus [22] suggesting targeting by a resistance mechanism or competition with the parental virus as the mechanism involved. The exact mechanism of truncation of the transgene in our study is less clear as a previous study using the same vector and host with a different transgene did not exhibit the same instability [7] . The larger size of the EB4 peptide in comparison to the Hepatitis B epitope, however, suggests that the truncation mechanism or transgene recognition by the virus was size dependent.",

The reported limitation of low-modified coat protein yield of this type of read-through transient expression system appears to have been overcome as relatively equal yield of chimeric and wild-type CGMMV coat protein were produced. This report also provides a rational harvesting timeline for the chimeric virus making this system exploitable for implementation in a plantation scale in the future. It can be suggested that once host plants are infected with the chimeric virus carrying the inserted foreign peptides, the optimum harvesting time would be at around 14 dpi or not more than 20 dpi in order to obtain maximum yield of the full-length transgene. Growth of the infected plants for longer periods to obtain higher yields of the chimeric virus may induce unwanted transgene deletions. This and other factors described earlier should be relevant information for the further development of CGMMV or other plant viruses as vectors for medically important peptides such as for dengue (this study) and Hepatitis B [7] viral antigens.",
