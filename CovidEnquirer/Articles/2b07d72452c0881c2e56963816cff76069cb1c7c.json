Feline leukaemia virus DNA vaccine efficacy is enhanced by coadministration with interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-18 expression vectors. J Virol 2001;75:8424-33]. However, the relative contribution of each cytokine gene towards protection is unknown. This study aimed to resolve this issue. IL-12 and IL-18 constructs were modified to ensure effective expression, and bioactivity was demonstrated using specific assays. Kittens were immunised intramuscularly with FeLV DNA and various cytokine constructs. Together with control kittens, these were challenged oronasally with FeLV and monitored for 15 weeks. All six kittens given FeLV, IL-12 and IL-18 were protected from the establishment of persistent viraemia and four from latent infection. Of six kittens immunised with FeLV DNA and IL-18, all were protected from viraemia and five from latent infection. In contrast, three of five kittens given FeLV DNA and IL-12 became persistently viraemic. Therefore, the adjuvant effect on the FeLV DNA vaccine appears to reside in the expression of IL-18.",

The virus spreads mainly via saliva and nasal secretions [2] and infection results in one of several outcomes. Cats that mount a sufficiently powerful immune response will recover, usually with the development of virus neutralising antibodies (VNAb) [3] , and FeLV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) [4] . Infected cats that do not mount an adequate immune response are usually anergic to the virus and become persistently viraemic [5, 6] . Most viraemic cats succumb to FeLV-related disease within 2-4 years of infection. Many of the animals that ostensibly recover develop a latent infection in which the virus is restricted by the host immune response to the bone marrow and probably other tissues [7, 8] . In the majority of these cases, virus is eliminated from the bone marrow within 30 months of exposure [9, 10] , but in some cases may persist and may be reactivated in animals that are immunosuppressed or treated with corticosteroids [8] .",

            "text": "Studies of the immune response to FeLV have shown that recovery from infection is associated with the initial development of virus-specific CTL followed by the appearance of VNAb [4] . It follows, therefore, that a vaccine designed to stimulate cell-mediated immunity, such as DNA vaccination, may be particularly useful in blocking the initial stages of FeLV infection. Indeed, a DNA vaccine consisting of plasmid vectors encoding gag/pol and env genes of FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 [19] protected cats against both the establishment of persistent viraemia and latency when administered together with plasmids encoding feline IL-12 and IL-18 [1] . The rationale for using both cytokines was that IL-12 and IL-18 act synergistically on T and natural killer (NK) cells to stimulate the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u2425), a mediator of the induction of CTL [20, 21] . In the previous vaccination study [1] , those animals that were protected by the vaccine had higher virus-specific effector CTL in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs than cats that became persistently viraemic [4] . However, the relative contribution of each cytokine to the efficacy of the vaccine was not established: the IL-18 construct alone in combination with the FeLV DNA was not tested for efficacy, and the failure of the IL-12 construct to act as an adjuvant might have been due to inappropriate expression of both subunits. In order to resolve this issue, we have now carried out a further study using improved IL-12 and IL-18 cytokine constructs, and have tested the efficacy of each genetic adjuvant independently as well as together.",

The expression and bioactivity of feline ILRAP-IL-18 has been described previously [31] . In the present study, the expression of flexi-IL-12 was demonstrated by Western blot analysis of transfection products. Proteins in the supernatant fluid or cell lysate were electrophoresed in a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to PVDF membranes and incubated with rabbit anti-feline p40 peptide antibody followed by anti-rabbit HRP antibody (Fig. 2) . The flexi-IL-12 supernatant contained a 75 kDa protein corresponding to flexi-IL-12 protein, which was not evident in the cell lysate. There was no evidence of IL-12 p40 subunit in the flexi-IL-12 supernatant, but this protein was demonstrated in the p40 transfection supernatant, indicated by a 40 kDa band. The bioactivity of flexi-IL-12 transfection supernatants was analysed using a bioassay that measures the amount of equine IFN-\u2425 produced in response to IL-12 by LN156 cells [35] . Graphs of IFN-\u2425 against supernatant dilution were plotted (Fig. 3) . Flexi-IL-12 supernatant produced an S-shaped dose response curve. To ensure the specificity of the response, incubation of the supernatant with the mouse anti-human IL-12 neutralising antibody moved the curve to the right indicating that the stimulation of IFN-\u2425 was suppressed. Incubation with anti-protein A non-neutralising antibody had no effect on the IFN\u2425 produced.",

To determine if any of these vaccines had induced sterilising immunity, assays of anti-FeLV antibodies were carried out on the plasma of the kittens after their course of vaccination, on the day of challenge, and 15 weeks later at the end of the trial. From our experience of other similar DNA vaccines in the cat [1, 40] , it was anticipated that none of the DNA vaccines would induce antibodies. Consequently, the induction of sterilising immunity by any of the vaccines should result in blocking the replication of the challenge virus and might not be followed by the appearance of antiviral antibodies in the plasma. The results of assays for VNAb and antibodies to individual FeLV proteins detected by Western blotting are shown in Table 3 .",

[1] , that a vaccine containing FeLV gag/pol and env genes together with the cytokine gene adjuvants IL-12 and IL-18 provides complete protection against FeLV viraemia in cats. The rationale for using these particular cytokines was that they induce cell-mediated immune responses, which at that time were believed to be responsible for protection against FeLV infection, and are now known to be involved [6] . While each cytokine promotes a Th1 type of immune response, IL-12 and IL-18 act synergistically by enhancing the expression of IFN-\u2425 [20] , a pleotropic cytokine that is crucial to the normal functioning of cell-mediated immunity [41] . In the previous FeLV DNA vaccine study, the relative role of each cytokine gene was not established; a group of cats vaccinated with FeLV DNA and IL-18 alone was not included in the vaccine trial and there were doubts about the efficacy of the IL-12 construct. In particular, since the subunits of IL-12 were expressed from separate plasmids, it was possible that p40 homodimer formation antagonised active IL-12 [25] , inhibiting the adjuvant effect of the cytokine. Therefore, in the present study a primary aim was to modify the cytokine constructs of feline IL-12 and IL-18 and to show that each cytokine was expressed at high levels in vitro and was bioactive, prior to their use in the vaccine experiment.",

We considered that it was important to establish whether a vaccine administered by parenteral inoculation could protect against challenge by the natural mucosal route. In order to overcome the natural resistance to oronasal FeLV infection that develops in kittens of the age used in the trial, a protocol was employed in which fractionated doses of virus were given over a period of 8 days. Previously, 83% of 15-17-week-old cats developed persistent viraemia using this schedule [37] . In the present study, only 4/6 of the non-vaccinated control kittens became persistently viraemic, which per se made comparison of the efficacy of each vaccine difficult because of the small numbers of animals in each group.

Clearly, the combination of cytokine genes together with FeLV DNA provided excellent protection, as before. We also found that ILRAP-IL-18 alone was sufficiently potent as an adjuvant to protect animals from persistent viraemia and latent infection, whereas the flexi-IL-12 adjuvant did not produce significant protection. This result is in line with studies of other viruses that failed to demonstrate a positive effect of IL-12 on DNA vaccination, including FIV [47] , feline coronavirus [48] or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [49] . Indeed, in some of these studies, inhibition of the anti-viral immune response was found. In certain cases, immunosuppression has been related to the dose of IL-12 DNA and the timing of IL-12 administration. Thus, high doses of recombinant murine IL-12 increased the susceptibility of mice to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus whereas lower doses enhanced the immune response [50] ; and an adenovirus vector expressing IL-12 enhanced the cellular immune response to a hepatitis C vaccine, but higher doses of IL-12 abrogated this effect [51] . In addition, immunosuppression was induced when IL-12 was administered before or together with JEV, but not if given after the immunisation [49] .",

The predominant function of IL-18 in the immune system is the stimulation of the Th1-type immune response through production of IFN-\u2425 [20, 21] . IL-18 also enhances the proliferation of T cells in a dose-dependent manner, an effect that is not IFN-\u2425 dependent [20] . In addition, this cytokine selectively enhances Fas ligand (FasL)mediated cytotoxicity of murine Th1 cells, and stimulates perforin-dependent cytotoxicity of NK cells [54, 55] . Therefore, the functions of IL-18 explain the impressive protective effect of ILRAP-IL-18 that was observed in this study.

            "text": "A cellular immune response, probably mediated through CTL, is alone sufficient to protect cats from FeLV infection [6] . As in the previous trial, none of the vaccines induced VNAb before challenge. In fact no commercial FeLV vaccine consistently induces VNAb, although non-neutralising antibodies to the antigens in the vaccine, such as gp70, are elicited [32, 56] . Analysis of the few feline DNA vaccination experiments that have been documented, show varying humoral responses to the antigen concerned. In one case, a minimalistic immunogenic defined gene expression vector, which expressed FIV gp140 and feline IL-12, elicited protection without producing a specific humoral response [57] . However, a DNA plasmid encoding FIV gp120 was found to induce a virus-specific antibody response [58] . Evidence suggests that the particular viral antigen used, as well as the vaccine schedule and route of administration have a strong influence over the presence or type of immune response produced, including the development of specific antibodies. While the level of protection achieved in this trial was very high, it was not due to sterilising immunity since anti-FeLV antibodies were produced by all of the cats following challenge. However, the median VNAb titre of the kittens vaccinated with FeLV DNA and IL-18 DNA that resisted the challenge was lower than that of the few cats in the control groups that did not become viraemic. Although this difference in titre was not significantly different, the result gives an indication that virus growth might have been inhibited in the vaccinated kittens immediately following challenge.",
