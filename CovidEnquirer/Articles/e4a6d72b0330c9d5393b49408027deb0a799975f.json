Loss of appropriate interactions between these systems probably contributes to morbidity and mortality in infectious diseases. For instance, inflammatory cytokines and leukocyte elastase can downregulate natural anticoagulant proteins that help to maintain endothelial-cell integrity, control clotting, inhibit vasoactive peptides and dampen leukocyte infiltration into the vessel wall. This Review will summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between these two important systems.",

For instance, as viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), progress into severe sepsis, markers of blood coagulation are increased markedly [2] . Blood coagulation components are not simply bystanders but can either amplify or inhibit the inflammatory response. Blood clotting can be initiated when inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin induce the de novo synthesis of tissue factor on leukocytes [3] . Exposure of tissue factor to the blood then triggers the coagulation cascade. Complement activation can lead to the formation of plasma membrane surfaces enriched in negatively charged phospholipids that amplify the coagulation reactions [4, 5] .",

            "text": "The blood clotting process is extremely complex (the more biochemical details are reviewed in Refs [14, 15] ). Briefly, blood coagulation is initiated when tissue factor comes into contact with blood ( Figure 1 ). Under normal circumstances, there is little tissue factor in the intravascular compartment. Most of the tissue factor is found constitutively expressed on extravascular cells, where it surrounds the vessels providing a mechanism to rapid seal breaches in vessel integrity [16] . Recent studies have indicated that there is a circulating form of tissue factor, probably localized on leukocyte-derived microparticles [17] [18] [19] . This microparticle-bound tissue factor might be concentrated on P-selectin on activated platelets in forming thrombi through interaction with its ligand, PSGL 1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1), from the activated leukocytes. Inflammatory stimuli can increase this response, both by stimulating tissue factor synthesis and promoting microparticle formation. Microparticles express high levels of negatively charged phospholipids on their surface [5] , thus promoting both the tissue factorfactor VIIa-mediated factor X and IX activation, and enabling the propagation of coagulation by the factor Xa-factor Va activation of prothrombin and the factor IXa-factor VIIIa activation of factor X. Potent platelet agonists, such as thrombin in combination with collagen or complement C5b-9, can further augment the availability of negatively charged phospholipid membrane surfaces on cells, particularly platelets, thus enabling further amplification of the coagulation system [5, 20] . Once initiated, the coagulation pathway has the potential to generate w100 times more thrombin than is required to form a rapid, firm clot. Under most conditions, this is prevented by the natural anticoagulant mechanism. The major inhibitory mechanisms involve the protein C anticoagulant pathway, antithrombin-heparin, and the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI).",

This complex, in concert with protein C bound to the endothelial-cell protein C receptor (EPCR), generates activated protein C. Once activated, protein C dissociates from the EPCR and can bind to protein S on membrane surfaces. The activated protein C-protein S complex then inactivates factors Va and VIIIa. Without these cofactors, factor Xa and factor IXa have much less than 1% of the capacity to activate the downstream zymogen. Practically, this means that inactivation of the cofactors shuts off the coagulation system completely. In addition, relative to thrombin in solution, thrombin bound to thrombomodulin is inhibited much more rapidly by antithrombin and protein C inhibitor [21] .",

Interleukin-1b (IL-1b), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and endotoxin can downregulate thrombomodulin and the EPCR by inhibiting gene transcription [34, 35] , reducing the ability to generate activated protein C. Neutrophil elastase cleaves thrombomodulin from the endothelial-cell surface, generating a much less active form of thrombomodulin [36] . In septic patients, both the EPCR and thrombomodulin can be severely downregulated, as demonstrated both immunohistochemically [37] and by analysis of the ability of the patients to generate activated protein C [38] . In addition, protein C levels decrease dramatically in patients with severe sepsis. This is probably due to a combination of consumption and liver (the main site of protein C synthesis) dysfunction. The degree of protein C reduction correlates with a negative prognosis in septic patients [39] .",

Because factor X binding to this receptor augments factor X activation [41, 42] , the downregulation of this cellular factor X receptor decreases both leukocyte adhesion and coagulation. The addition of antithrombin to endothelial cells in culture increases prostacyclin formation [43] and decreases NF-kB signaling [10] .

Antithrombin binding to syndecan 4, a proteoglycan on neutrophils, inhibits chemokine-induced neutrophil migration [44] . Interestingly, heparin blocks this effect.

            "text": "The protein C anticoagulant pathway has several components that reduce the inflammatory response. Thrombomodulin not only increases protein C activation but also prevents thrombin from activating proteaseactivated receptors (PARs) [46, 47] . This is accomplished at least in part because the site on thrombin (anion binding exosite 1) responsible for binding PAR1 and thrombomodulin overlap ( Figure 5 ). In addition, thrombin bound to thrombomodulin gains the ability to activate a plasma procarboxypeptidase R [also known as thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI)] [48] . Recent studies have shown that his carboxypeptidase is a very potent inhibitor of the complement anaphylatoxin, C5a [49, 50] , and bradykinin [50] . By inhibiting these vasoactive substances, the generation of this carboxypeptidase, especially in the microcirculation [51] , probably helps to prevent severe drops in blood pressure and microvascular injury, and subsequent edema, in animals with severe acute inflammatory injuries. In addition to these functions, recent studies have shown that thrombomodulin has direct anti-inflammatory activity on the endothelium. Thrombomodulin is a multidomain molecule. When the N-terminal lectin domain is deleted, protein C and carboxypeptidase R activation proceed normally. However, when this mutant is used to replace the normal thrombomodulin gene in mice, the mice recruit leukocytes much more avidly than wild-type mice in response to inflammatory stimuli. Infusion of the isolated lectin domain can reverse this response [52] . Cell culture studies demonstrated that this domain dampened the mitogen activated kinase and NF-kB responses in endothelium [51] .",

EPCR shares considerable sequence identity to the MHC I-CD1 family of molecules [35] . The crystal structure of EPCR reveals that, like the CD1 family, EPCR has a tightly bound lipid, in this case phospholipid, located in a region virtually identical to the antigen-presenting groove in the CD1 family [60] (Figure 6 ). In CD1 proteins, glycolipids bind in this grove and can have a major role in the immune response to bacterial infection [61] . In addition, deficiency of CD1d in mice leads to autoimmune disease [62] . From the structural similarities, it is probable, but as yet unproven, that EPCR might have roles similar to those of CD1 molecules in the regulation of inflammation. Autoantibodies to EPCR and a correlation with autoimmune fetal loss have recently been demonstrated [63] , consistent with its involvement in immune regulation.",

Natural anticoagulant proteins exhibit a spectrum of anti-inflammatory activities, including inhibiting NF-kB signaling, inhibiting complement C5a and bradykinin and preventing apoptosis. Severe acute inflammatory challenges can downregulate the natural anticoagulants, thereby diminishing their ability to dampen the coagulant and inflammatory responses. When this happens, a progressive cycle can evolve in which the coagulation increases the inflammatory response, thereby increasing the coagulant response until severe vascular and organ injury occurs. Modulation of this complex series of interactive events promises to offer an attractive method for intervening clinically in diseases involving acute inflammatory Thrombin (T) and some other coagulation enzymes react preferentially with the bound AT. In the case of T this requires T binding to the glycosaminoglycan (syndecan 4). Once T binds to the inhibitor, major conformational changes occur that lead to the release of the complex [78] . In the absence of T, AT binding to the glycosaminoglycan leads to cell signaling, increasing prostacyclin (PGI 2 ) formation and decreasing NF-kB activation.",

Several possibilities could explain the failure of the natural anticoagulants TFPI and antithrombin in the trials. First, in the clinical situation, bleeding complications limit dosage to a greater extent than in the animal studies. For instance, the anticoagulant doses in the baboon sepsis model were much higher than in the human trials [74] . Therefore, the doses of the anticoagulants might not have been adequate. In the antithrombin trial, heparin was used in many of the patients [70] . As noted earlier, heparin blocks several cellular effects of antithrombin. Although there was no overall effect on survival with antithromin, the patients with heparin alone or antithrombin alone tended to have a better survival rate than the patients who received both [70] .",

Antithrombin and activated protein C share several antiinflammatory functions in vitro and in animal models. Few studies have explored differences between the natural anticoagulants with respect to the cellular responses and particular vascular beds that are impacted when an ongoing inflammatory challenge is in place at the time of inhibitor administration. Furthermore, in the patient populations, many co-morbidities might decrease efficacy of one of the inhibitors selectively. Co-morbidities, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes and hypertension, can exacerbate the innate inflammatory response by a variety of mechanisms, including downregulation of the natural anticoagulants [75] .

Binding of Ca 2C ions (magenta spheres) to the PC Gla domain (green ribbon) exposes the N-terminal 'omega' loop, which in the absence of EPCR interacts with the phospholipid surfaces on the membrane.

In addition, although our understanding of the regulation of blood coagulation in systems with artificial membrane surfaces is relatively sophisticated, cellular control of coagulation is still an emerging area. For instance, activated protein C is a potent anticoagulant involving liposomes. By contrast, it is a relatively poor anticoagulant on platelet surfaces. In model systems of blood coagulation, in which platelets are present over endothelium, it appears that activated protein C anticoagulant functions occur on the endothelial cell rather than the platelet surface [76] .

A chondroitin sulfate moiety on TM increases the affinity for thrombin but is not required for function. This chondroitin sulfate interacts with anion-binding exosite 2 on thrombin, a second, basic area near the heparin-binding site. The lectin domain of TM inhibits leukocyte adhesion and the MAP kinase pathway. Other functions of TM require the presence of different EGF domains. Domains 1-6 stimulate fibroblast growth; domains 3-6 are required for TAFI activation; domains 4-6 are required for PC activation; and thrombin-clotting activity is blocked by domains 5-6. The activation of PC to APC by the thrombin-TM complex is enhanced by binding of PC to EPCR through its gla domain[60]. Abbreviations: APC, activated protein C; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EPCR, endothelial-cell protein C receptor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PC, protein C; TAFI, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor; TM, thrombomodulin.TRENDS in Immunology Vol.25 No.10 October 2004",
