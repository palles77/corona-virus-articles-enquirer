Furthermore, formation of CK8 and CK18 complexes due to CK8 phosphorylation at Ser73 and Ser431 was found to be strongly associated with promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis by PB and the development of hepatocellular carcinomas. The data were confirmed by immunohistochemistry and real-time Q-PCR and profound overexpression of CK8 and CK18 (CK8/18) proteins and mRNAs were detected in several large size GST-P positive foci and liver tumors. A strong correlation between CK8/18 positive foci development and multiplicity of hepatocellular carcinomas was further observed. Moreover, elevation of CK8/18 was strongly associated with induction of cell proliferation in GST-P positive foci and tumors. In conclusion, our data imply that CK8/18 overexpression, those two cytokeratins complex formation associated with histone type 2 H2aa3 up-regulation and intermediate filament reorganization may drive neoplastic transformation of GST-P positive foci during rat hepatocarcinogenesis leading to the formation of hepatocellular carcinomas.",

            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, the most common type of liver cancer) is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with an increasing incidence worldwide (Lee et al., 2005) . HCC commonly emerges on a background of chronic liver disease (Thorgeirsson and Grisham, 2002; El-Serag, 2004) , with continuous rounds of necrosis and regeneration, inflammation, oxidative stress and genetic alterations, for example involving the p53 gene as suspected causative factors (Thorgeirsson and Grisham, 2002) . However, the molecular mechanisms linked to lesion development and progression are still far from clear. It is known that profound changes at the cellular and subcellular level, involving RNA/DNA and protein structure and functions lead to liver cancer development and progression. Therefore, high-throughput, effective proteomic techniques targeting relevant biological molecules may provide novel insights into hepatocarcinogenesis and prognosis (Melle et al., 2007) . In rat models of HCC, glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci (GST-P + foci), arise after initiation and are believed to be precursors for the later formation of tumors (Ito et al., 1998) . However, only a very small proportion finally develops into hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas, and the concrete sequence of events occurring during this transformation is unknown. Recently it has been proposed that tumor development is regulated by cancer stem cells, which have such properties as self-renewal, the ability to produce different progeny and increased expression of developmental signaling molecules (Banas et al., 2006) . Identification of novel biomarkers of liver preneoplastic lesions and cancer stem cells and further elucidation of the signaling pathways that regulate their growth and survival may provide clues to novel therapeutic approaches to treat liver cancer.",

In this context, emerging proteomic analysis platforms, including mass spectrometry technologies and protein microarrays, represent powerful tools for study and understanding of cancer. It is clear that identification of biomarkers for the early diagnosis of the premalignant state should be one of the main goals in this emerging field (Alessandro et al., 2005) . However, there has so far been only limited success in determining protein spectra of preneoplastic lesions mostly due to technological difficulties, and a new system is needed.",

Screening of proteomes on anionic (Q10), and cationic (CM10) ProteinChip arrays here demonstrated significant overexpression of intermediate filament members CK8 and CK18, microsomal cytochrome 5A and histone type 2 H2aa3 in the livers of rats initiated with DEN and promoted with PB. Furthermore, from the CM10 array results, the m/z 8126, 9231, 11,243, and 13,771 peaks were significantly overexpressed in GST-P + foci of rats treated with PB. Trends for increase of m/z 8214, 11,357 peaks and CK8 on the Q10 array and m/z 13,771 and His H2aa3 on the CM10 array were also observed in the DEN initiation control group. Single marker analysis showed CK8 and CK18 to be profoundly overexpressed in GST-P + foci of PB-treated rats, thus presenting as promising biomarkers. The data of immunohistochemistry and real-time Q-PCR supported the results of SELDI ProteinChip array, demonstrating concordance between induction of CK8 and CK18 proteins and their mRNAs. Furthermore, a correlation of CK8/18 + foci development and multiplicity of HCCs was observed.

CK8 and CK18 mutations are thus reported as risk factors for developing liver diseases of multiple etiologies, such as biliary atresia and viral hepatitis (Ku et al., 2003) . One specific mutation of CK8 (G61C) was found to be a genetic risk factor for the development of cryptogenic liver cirrhosis (Schoniger-Hekele et al., 2006) . A CK8 mutation was also found in another series of cryptogenic cirrhosis cases in association with particular autoimmune features (Ku et al., 2001) . In humans, CK18 mutation can also predispose to cryptogenic cirrhosis Ku et al., 2001) . Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing a CK18 conserved arginine mutant were shown to be susceptible to chronic hepatitis, with increased levels of soluble phosphoglycokeratins (Ku et al., 1995) . It has been further demonstrated that cells transfected with human CK8 and CK18 exhibit enhanced migratory and invasive potential (Chu et al., 1993) .

            "text": "In the present study, CK8 phosphorylation at Ser73 and Ser431 and overexpression of phosphorylated forms in GST-P + foci was found to Fig. 3 . Double immunohistochemistry for phospho-CK8 p73 (A-C) or p431 (D-F) (brown) and GST-P (red) in GST-P + foci, HAs and HCCs; histone H2A (brown) and GST-P (red) (G-I) and immunohistochemical assessment of CK8/18 (red) and PCNA (black) (J and K) in the livers of F344 rats treated with PB after DEN initiation. Elevation of PCNA positive cells number was observed in CK8/18 + area within totally or partially stained GST-P + foci (L). Note high expression of CK8/18 in mitotic cells in GST-P positive focus (J, arrow). be strongly associated with promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis by PB and the development of hepatocellular carcinomas. It has been previously reported that CK8 and CK18 are able to form complexes due to CK8 phosphorylation (Toivola et al., 1998; Ku et al., 2002; Nousiainen et al., 2006) . Dynamic phosphorylation is one of the mechanisms regulating more than 20 keratin type I and II intermediate filament proteins in epithelial cells. The major type II keratin in \"simple type\" glandular epithelia is CK8. Biochemical and mutational approaches have been used to localize the two major in vivo phosphorylation sites of human CK8 to the head (Ser23) and tail (Ser-431) domains. CK8 Ser73 occurs within a relatively conserved type II keratin motif ((68)NQSLLSPL) and becomes phosphorylated in cultured cells and organs during mitosis, cell stress, and apoptosis (Nousiainen et al., 2006) . Furthermore, Ser73 phosphorylation is reported to play an important role in keratin filament reorganization (Toivola et al., 1998; Ku et al., 2002) . CK8 was also suggested to be a new cytoplasmic target for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in Fas receptor-mediated signaling, and has been shown to be exclusively phosphorylated in vitro by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (He et al., 2002; Ku et al., 2002) . In another study, it was demonstrated that shear stress, but not stretch, causes disassembly of keratin intermediate filaments in lung alveolar epithelial cells and that this disassembly is regulated by protein kinase C delta (PKC\u03b4)mediated phosphorylation of CK8 Ser73 (Ridge et al., 2005) . The functional significance of these phosphorylations could relate to regulation of JNK signaling, p38 MAPK or PKC\u03b4 signaling and/or regulation of keratin dynamics (He et al., 2002; Ku et al., 2002) . On the other hand, CK8 Ser431 phosphorylation was found to occur after EGF stimulation and during mitotic arrest and is likely to be mediated by MAPK and cdc2 kinase . A monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes phosphoserine 431-CK8 manifests increased reactivity with CK8 and recognizes reorganized CK8/18 filaments after EGF stimulation. In vivo, the specific serine sites 73 and 431 of CK8 phosphorylated by p38, influence Mallory body formation (Nan et al., 2006) . On the other hand, CK18, when phosphorylated, plays a role in filament reorganization and together with CK8, is involved in interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated barrier protection (Wang et al., 2007) . Our results indicated that elevation of CK8/18 is strongly associated with induction of cell proliferation in GST-P + foci and tumors. Recently, CK8 and CK18 were reported to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) and moderate tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced JNK intracellular signaling and NFkappa B activation. This moderation of the effects of TNF, a cytokine produced by macrophages and T lymphocytes affecting cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival, and cell death, may be the fundamental function of CK8 and CK18 common to liver regeneration, hepatotoxin sensitivity, and the diagnostic, persistent expression of these cytokeratins in many carcinomas (Caulin et al., 2000) . Kitano et al. (1998) have reported that development of transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1) positive foci in the livers of rats treated with PB is basically similar to that of GST-P + foci (Kitano et al., 1998) . Thus, the elevation of cell proliferation detected by double immunohistochemical staining in areas of CK8/18 + foci suggests a correspondence with the previously observed effect of PB administration on formation of TGF-\u03b1 positive foci. Rise of the PCNA labeling index within the CK8/18 + areas observed in our study 10 weeks post treatment with 500 ppm dose of PB is generally in line with published results regarding hepatocarcinogenesis (Kolaja et al., 1996) .",

Two molecules of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form an octamer, around which approximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in nucleosomes. The linker histone H1 gene is intronless and encodes a member of the histone H2A family. Histone cluster 2, H2aa3 (Hist2H2aa3) elevation was previously reported in human serous ovarian carcinoma and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Donninger et al., 2004) . Furthermore, overexpression of histones was recently reported in human HCCs (Ho et al., 2008) . Moreover, it was revealed that histone 3 co-immunoprecipitated with CK18 in HCCs. It was therefore suggested that modulation of the cytoskeleton might disturb the organization of the nucleoskeleton which might further cause instability and fragility of nuclei, possibly exposing the histone and co-immunoprecipitating it with CK18. Thus, the overexpression of Hist2H2aa3 observed in the present study might be related to modulation of CK18 and play an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis.",

This was presumed due to increase of intracellular OH U and enhanced protein and activity levels of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2B1/2 and CYP3A2 (Kinoshita et al., 2003) . While expression of those P450 isoenzymes is generally lacking in GST-P + foci, we here found elevation of liver microsomal cytochrome b5 (Cyb5A), a membrane-bound hemoprotein which functions as an electron carrier for several membranebound oxygenases. Cyb5A interacts with NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and has been recently shown to be required for some cytochrome P-450-catalyzed reactions (Shimakata et al., 1972) .",

Coupling laser assisted microdissection and SELDI ProteinChip Array technology provides tremendous opportunities to identify cell and tumor specific proteins and understand molecular events underlying liver preneoplasia development, and furthermore, might become a powerful tool for the early diagnosis of cancer.",
