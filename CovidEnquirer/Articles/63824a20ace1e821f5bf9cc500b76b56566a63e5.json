The authors compared the psychiatric symptoms and psychosocial functioning of exposed and unexposed hospital personnel at two time points. The research was conducted during 2009 and included a survey of two random samples of hospital personnel (physicians and nurses), one collected during the Gaza War and the other 6 months later. Each sample included hospital personnel who were exposed to war-related stress and others who were not (Study 1: n = 67 and 74 for exposed and unexposed, respectively; Study 2: n = 57 and 50 for exposed and unexposed, respectively). Levels of psychiatric symptoms and psychosocial functioning were measured. Compared to unexposed hospital personnel, exposed hospital personnel had a significantly higher level of post-traumatic symptoms during the Gaza War and 6 months later. In addition, during the Gaza War, exposed hospital personnel had a significantly higher level of depressive symptoms. However, in the second study, depressive symptoms were similar to those found in the unexposed group. These findings may suggest that war-related stress is associated with post-traumatic symptoms among hospital personnel even 6 months after exposure.",

Two studies with separate groups of participants were conducted. At Study 1, participants were comprised of hospital personnel selected at random from two hospitals during the week of January 12-15, 2009, 3 weeks after the war had begun. The recruitment of potential participants was done by interviewers who directly approached the hospital personnel and asked them to participate in the study. Each potential participant that consented was interviewed. The two hospitals were the Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon (exposed) and the Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv (unexposed). During the Gaza War, more than 750 rockets were launched into southern Israel, approximately 100 of which targeted the city of Ashkelon (Wikipedia, 2008 (Wikipedia, -2009 . During this time, the unsheltered Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon treated 616 people (193 Israeli soldiers, and 423 Israeli and Palestinian civilians) admitted to the hospital as a result of the armed conflict while under direct rocket attacks. Apart from southern Israel, the rest of the country was not within missile range and was considered as unexposed. Therefore, the Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv and its personnel were not exposed to war-related stress during the Gaza War. The response rate in our study was 85% at Barzilai Medical Center (exposed) and 90% at Sourasky Medical Center (unexposed). Those who declined were asked about their reasons for refusal. A lack of time was the most frequent reason given for not participating. The total number of hospital personnel eligible for this study was (n = 141): 67 exposed participants from Barzilai Medical Center (mean age 40.67 (S.D. = 10.11); range 25-60; 50 women; 47 married; 21 physicians) and 74 unexposed participants from Sourasky Medical Center (mean age 38.46 (S.D. = 9.45); range 24-60; 51 women; 46 married; 33 physicians). The ratio between nurses and physicians in Israel is about 2:1 (Ministry of Health, 2010). The two groups did not differ in background demographics. See Table 1 for more details.",

The procedure was the same as in Study 1 with one marked difference, each participant was asked whether s/he had previously participated in the study. Twelve participants who answered positively were excluded from the study in order to prevent partial sample overlap, thus rendering each study independent. The response rate was 82% at Barzilai Medical Center (previously exposed) and 87% at Sourasky Medical Center (previously unexposed). Again, lack of time was the most frequent reason given for declining to participate. The total number of hospital personnel eligible for this study was 107: 57 previously exposed participants (who did not participate in the first study) from Barzilai Medical Center (mean age 40.65 (S.D. = 10.63); range 25-63; 46 women; 34 married; 12 physicians), and 50 previously unexposed participants from Sourasky Medical Center (mean age 37.30 (S.D. = 9.07); range 23-58; 40 women; 34 married; 19 physicians). The two groups did not differ in background demographics. See Table 1 for more details. All hospital personnel who participated in the studies (both Study 1 and Study 2) as part of the exposed groups from Barzilai Medical Center worked there during the war and were exposed to direct rocket attacks. There were no significant differences in all the background characteristics between the entire Study 1 sample and the entire Study 2 sample. See Table 1 for more demographic details.",

The exposure to rocket attacks, the extreme workload and pressure were associated with higher levels of stress and depressive symptoms among exposed personnel. Furthermore, even 6 months after the end of the armed conflict, there was an association of war-related stress with higher levels of post-traumatic symptoms among exposed hospital personnel. There were significant differences in depressive symptoms in Study 1, but not in Study 2. This is in line with previous studies that challenge the common view that hospital personnel are not affected by stress (Firth-Cozens et al., 1999; Luce et al., 2002; Ben-Ezra et al., 2007) . Although hospital personnel are considered resilient in comparison to the general population, they are not invulnerable (Neimeyer et al., 1983; Einav et al., 2008) . It seems that prolonged and repeated exposure, even for a very selected and professional population, takes its toll. This is to say, that the inoculation of this population has its limits and represents only a part of the picture. Professional populations that are re-exposed to traumatic experiences due to their duty can encapsulate resilient aspects that might help them to help others. Still, it is important to remember that it does not mean that they are invulnerable. Policy makers should take into consideration that exposure to traumatic events has a price even among hospital personnel (Firth-Cozens et al., 1999; Luce et al., 2002; Ben-Ezra et al., 2007; Palgi et al., 2009 ).",

However, the use of random sampling in the two studies may have reduced this limitation to some extent. Indeed, participants at Study 1 and Study 2 did not differ in demographic background. Moreover, the fact that the hospital personnel had similar pre-and post-conflict history may have also strengthened this study's conclusions. The second limitation is that no actual psychiatric diagnosis was made. Although the interviewers had an extensive background in psychology, the time constraints did not enable a thorough clinical assessment, and also affected the length of the questionnaire battery being used. On the other hand, as psychiatric symptoms were assessed while being in an unsheltered hospital that was targeted by rockets, it may have been that extreme circumstances enhanced the reliability of the measured constructs to some extent. Future studies should perform prospective assessments of hospital personnel during wartime crisis and natural disasters and investigate ways to enhance their resilience and lower their vulnerability. Future studies should also document the nature of wartime exposures (contact with patients vs. personal threat of injury or death) (Fain and Schreier, 1989; Tattersall et al., 1999; Dekel et al., 2007) in order to assess the relative effect of different exposure types.",
