Moreover, the combustion of fossil fuels inevitably generates air pollutants including carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and others. Combining with other anthropogenic air pollutants, visibility in many Asian cities including Hong Kong have deteriorated rapidly in the past decades. This paper explores the relationships between energy use, meteorological factors, and change in visibility in Hong Kong using long-term timeseries data. The total use of primary energy increased from 146,700 TJ in 1971 to 1,270,865 TJ in 2011 while the number of hours of reduced visibility increased from 184 h to 1398 h during the same period of time. Bivariate correlations show that poor visibility was significantly associated with energy use and annual mean air temperature. Multiple regression analysis indicates that the burning of aviation gasoline significantly, adversely affect visibility. Results illustrate that the number of clear days in Hong Kong will decrease, in particular due to the increase in air traffic.",

            "text": "Urbanization forces Asian cities to develop and expand rapidly. Indeed, many cities have followed a similar development process, i.e. from a manufacturing-based economy in the 1960s and 1970s to a service-based economy in recent years. Although the World Development Report [1] argues that air pollution level normally rises with income per capita but it should start to decline when income per capita exceeds a threshold level, for example, particulate matter should decrease when income per capita exceeds US$ 250. This inverted U-shape curve is known as Environmental Kuznets Curve [2, 3] . Unfortunately, this argument is not applicable to Asia. For example, annual income per capita in Hong Kong was US$ 9096 in 1985 and reached US$17,023 in 2011. However, the total mass concentration of particulate matter, i.e. ultrafine particles, PM 2.5 and PM 10 , in fact was much higher in 2011 than that in 1971 which in turn affects visibility in Hong Kong [4e6] . Air pollution is still one of main concerns for people living and working here [6] . Researchers reported that poor air quality was found to be significantly associated with severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [7] , might cause cancers [8] and mortality [6, 7] . The impact on human health is even more severe when air pollutants are in the form of gaseous [7] or aerosols [9, 10] . In recent years, most Asian cities including Hong Kong have been covered by haze almost continuously between October and April [6,11e15] . Poor visibility, an integral form of air pollution in the dry season, may cause substantial psychological and physiological pressure on people.",

With a large number of unskilled workers from nearby Guangdong, local entrepreneurs, and rich families fled from Shanghai in the 1950s, many light-metal, plastic, toys, textile, and garment factories were established. These factories employed hundreds of thousands labors [18] . The manufacturing sector had expanded steadily until early 1980s under a favorable environment, i.e. relatively low rent, low transportation cost, and low labor cost because of the abundant of unskilled workers. For example, more than 0.3 million unskilled migrants found their way either legally or illegally into Hong Kong's labor market between 1978 and 1980. However, as land price and labor cost increased substantially in early 1980s, Hong Kong's manufacturing sector shrank rapidly and many industrialists relocated their factories to mainland China in which the \"open-door policy\" has been implemented since 1978. Hong Kong started transforming itself to a logistic hub and its finance and service sector expanded rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s. After almost two decades of transformation, Hong Kong succeeded to change itself from a manufacturing-based city to the busiest port in the world [19] as well as one of the world finance centers. Hong Kong's container terminals handled less than 0.7 million TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) in 1970 and steadily increased to handle 24.4 million TEU in 2011 [17] [20] . In 2011, Hong Kong attracted 37.8 million visitors and 28 percent of visitors traveled to Hong Kong by flights [17] . Hong Kong becomes a tourist center and the world financial center in Asia. In aviation, the passenger throughput increased from 1.2 million to 46.3 million while the cargo throughput increased from 26.5 thousand tonnes to 3.742 million tonnes between 1967 and 2007 [21] . In 2011, the number of flights arriving and departing from the Hong Kong International Airport was 334,000. On road surfaces, the number of vehicles increased from 162,000 in 1971 to 630,281 in 2011 [22] . The number of private vehicles alone increased from 93,000 to 434,843 during this period.",

It illustrated that the total energy use increases continuously except in 1997, 2008 and 2011. The sudden drops of energy use in these three years can be understood because as an open economy Hong Kong was significantly affected by the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the world financial crisis triggered by sub-prime mortgage problems in the United States in 2007e08 and 2010e11.",

Fig. 4 shows the percentage of thermal unit (i.e. using TJ) for oil products, gas products, and coal products from 1971 to 2011. It illustrates that Hong Kong predominately used oil products before 1982. Between 1971 and 1981, over 97 percent of the energy use of Hong Kong came from oil products. Heavy fuel oil was the main source of energy to generate electricity and to produce thermal energy in factories, hotels, hospitals, etc. From 1982 to 1995, Hong Kong's power companies consumed a significant amount of coals to generate electricity. In order to diversify the source of primary energy and to discharge less air pollutant to the environment, the Government of Hong Kong requested Hong Kong's power companies to use LNG in generating around 35 percent of electricity locally. Since 1995, a portion of electricity has been generated using LNG and has been imported from Shenzhen's Daya Bay Power Station.",

In Hong Kong, the visibility readings have been recorded by the Hong Kong Observatory at its headquarters located at the city's center [28] . Reduced visibility is defined as visibility below 8 km when there is no fog, mist, or precipitation [29] . The readings have been recorded based on hourly measurements using a forward scatter visibility meter. Fig. 5 shows the number of hours of reduced visibility observed at the Hong Kong Observatory from 1971 to 2011. Fig. 5 shows that there was no substantial change in visibility between 1971 and 1990. However, there was an upward trend after 1991. Fig. 6 shows the number of hours of reduced visibility observed at the same location on a monthly basis. It indicates that visibility in Hong Kong deteriorates; especially in autumn and winter that Hong Kong has been covered by haze continuously between October and April in recent years.

Visibility in Hong Kong has deteriorated continuously in the past decades while the net import of fossil fuel energy has increased by 10 times. Multiple regression analysis shows that the burning of aviation gasoline and kerosene significantly adversely affects visibility in Hong Kong, and burning of LPG and LNG moderately affects visibility. The effect of burning of other fossil fuels and meteorological factors on visibility on annual basis was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, correlation analysis between monthly visibility readings and monthly records of meteorological variables indicates that poor visibility was in general associated with lower air temperature i.e. the winter months in Hong Kong with higher mean atmospheric pressure and less or no rainfall. The findings of this study is consistent with the research works conducted recently in the United States and England [34e36] in which a significant amount (in terms of the number concentrations) of ultrafine particles were observed due to jet departures, jet landing, jet taxi and idle. Aircraft operations also produce a large amount of NO x (nitrogen oxides) and VOC (volatile organic compound) [35, 37] . In fact, it has been known that for an aircraft operating over on 800 km range approximately 25% of the emissions are produced during the take-off/landing cycle [38, 39] . As there are over a thousand commercial aircrafts departing and landing at the Hong Kong International Airport per day as reported by the China Daily [40] , many aircrafts taxi above Hong Kong and produce a significant amount of particulate matter in low troposphere. The aged particles with a mode diameter of 90 nm [34] will collide and grow to form the accumulation mode ultrafine particles. These accumulation mode particles will stay and disperse in low troposphere. They block and scatter the reflected visible light with a wavelength between 380 nm and 750 nm, causing a substantial reduction in visibility.",

LNG is primarily used by local power companies for producing electricity.

It has primarily caused by the burning of aviation gasoline and kerosene in Hong Kong SAR, China. According to the Report from the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department, the total number of flights landing and departing from Hong Kong increased from 166,223 in 1998 to 334,000 in 2011. Recently, there are more than a thousand flights landing and departing from Hong Kong per day. It is no doubt that air transport plays an important role in local economic development such as Hong Kong e one of the world finance centers, a regional tourism center, and the world's logistic hub. The Government of Hong Kong projects that traffic at the Hong Kong International Airport will increase to 490,000 in 2025 and planned to build the third runway to cope with the increased demand. However, it is expected that the number of hours of reduced visibility will increase to around 2117 by the Year 2025 (using Equation (2) and assuming the fuel consumption to be linearly proportional to the number of flights). It is almost impossible to Hong Kong to have a \"clear sky\" in future, especially between October and April, a period without high humidity, rains and storms to flush out ultrafine particulate pollutants.",
