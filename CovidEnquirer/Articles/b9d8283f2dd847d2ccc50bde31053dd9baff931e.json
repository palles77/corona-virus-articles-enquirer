NMR spectroscopic studies showed molybdenocene binds the oligonucleotide weakly and has no preference for guanine over adenine bases. Cyclic voltammetry corroborates in a quantitative manner that the interaction in fact is weak, showing only 4.9% of molybdenocene-oligoncleotide binding. This implicates that DNA cannot be completely ruled out as a target place but the mechanism is more complex than cis-platin.",

Compound 1 is 14 to 125 times more effective than cisplatin in inducing apoptosis in breast, lung, and prostate cancer cell lines. New chemical entities from paracetamol and NSAIDs were synthesized and evaluated for bioactivity. All the synthesized p-amidophenol derivatives showed improved antipyretic activity than paracetamol with retention of anti-inflammatory activity and no ulcerogenicity. Eight compounds [two naphthofuranoxepins (1, 2), one phenanthraquinone (3), three steroids (4-6), and two steroidal saponins (7, 8)] were isolated from the ethanolic extract of Dioscorea membranacea rhizomes and tested for anti-allergic activities. The results showed that dioscorealide B (2) possessed the highest activity with an IC 50 value of 5.7 lM, followed by dioscoreanone (3, IC 50 = 7.7 lM), dioscorealide A (1, IC 50 = 27.9 lM), and diosgenin (9, IC 50 = 29.9 lM). Structure-activity relationship studies of naphthofuranoxepins on anti-allergic activity revealed that the hydroxylation at position 8 conferred higher activity than methoxylation. For diosgenin derivatives, the aglycone was found to possess higher activity than the diglucosylated molecule; whereas substitution with rhamnoglucosides apparently results in loss of activity. Furthermore, effects of dioscorealide A (1), dioscorealide B (2), and dioscoreanone (3) on antigen-induced release of TNF-a and IL-4 were also examined. ",
