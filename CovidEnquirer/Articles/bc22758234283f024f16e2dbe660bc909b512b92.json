Although the infection may be responsible for some mortality, its impact is mainly associated with the impairment of intestinal functions and lower performance of animals. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cryptosporidiosis on the intestinal functions in neonatal experimentally infected Holstein calves. Absorption tests with D-xylose and retinyl-palmitate, and the lactulose/mannitol test of intestinal permeability were simultaneously performed in 1-week intervals from challenge to full recovery. In infected animals, reduced intestinal absorptive capacity for both D-xylose and retinyl-palmitate was observed on day 7 post-infection (p.i.). At the same time, a more than 100% elevation of intestinal permeability was observed in the infected calves.

Moreover, the tube was preventively rinsed each 2-3 days with 1 mL of 5% spectinomycine (Spectam, Sanofi, France). When blood was not taken, the catheter was covered with a sterile protective bandage to avoid damage or inflammation. This catheter enabled rapid blood sampling throughout the study by one person without causing excessive stress to the calves.",

Whereas on day 7 p.i. all clinically healthy animals had absorption curves with a plasma concentration peak of 3.09 AE 0.51 mM L \u00c01 at 2.5 h, the curve in sick animals receiving the same load had maximal concentration of only 1.72 AE 0.39 mM L \u00c01 at 2 h. These results may be influenced also by the severity of the infection. In fact, at day 7 p.i. most of infected calves showed severe diarrhoea, which in addition, may contribute to reducing the time of Dxylose exposure to the site of absorption, and thus lead to an underestimate of absorption. The D-xylose test results of Perin et al. (2001) obtained with HIV positive children partially support our observation in calves, since the highest impairment of the intestinal absorption was observed just in children with cryptosporidiosis. Interestingly, the authors of that study did not find a direct association between diarrhoea and xylose absorption. On day 14 p.i. all animals of the infected group were already clinically healthy and shed no oocysts, but absorption of D-xylose was still significantly lower than in control calves (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). Histological examinations of gnotobiotic calves infected by C. parvum confirmed negative alterations in the epithelial architecture (Heine et al., 1984; Ruest et al., 1997) ; our findings from day 14 p.i. are thus consistent with the results of Rolston and Mathan (1989) , which found that the D-xylose test mirrors primarily the intestinal absorptive surface rather than the performance of membrane transporters. The persisting malabsorption of D-xylose show that the small intestine in C. parvum infected calves requires more than 2 weeks to fully recover its absorptive surface. The results obtained on day 21 p.i. clearly show that intestinal functions probed by the D-xylose test were already fully reestablished.",

Higher intestinal permeability to Cr-EDTA in cryptosporidial calves in the acute stage of disease was previously observed by Hunt et al.

Moreover, the positive results of the guaiac test in all infected animals at the beginning of the patent period indicate a damage of the small intestine followed by desquamation of the mucosa and haemorrhage.

Significant differences in absorption of D-xylose as well as increased intestinal permeability were still detectable 14 days p.i., whereas on day 21 p.i. no alterations in monitored intestinal function was found. Smaller weight gains were nevertheless observed up to 21 day p.i., suggesting that the negative impact of cryptosporidiosis on the performance of animals persist for at least 3 weeks after challenge.",
