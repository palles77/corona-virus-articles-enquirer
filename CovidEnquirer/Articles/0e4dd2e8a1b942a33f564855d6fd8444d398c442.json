Of note: \u2022 Pneumonia is extraordinarily common; it is the most common reason for hospital admission in the United States other than women giving birth. \u2022 Mortality is higher with an admitting diagnosis of pneumonia for adults 65 years of age in the United States than for any of the other top 10 admitting diagnoses. \u2022 In 2011, pneumonia had an aggregate cost of nearly $10.6 billion for 1.1 million hospital stays in the United States. \u2022 It is the world's leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age, and it is the most common reason for children to be hospitalized in the United States. \u2022 Worldwide, pneumonia afflicts an estimated 450 million people per year and results in 4 million deaths.",

Because of the effectiveness of treatment, the diseases discussed in this chapter are typically gratifying to treat for all involved medical personnel. Unfortunately, the emerging trend during the past 20 years has been the acquisition of antibiotic resistance by some of the organisms causing pneumonia, and treatment of pneumonia has had to evolve to keep pace.",

When host defense mechanisms of the upper and lower respiratory tracts are overwhelmed, microorganisms may establish residence, proliferate, and cause a frank infectious process within the pulmonary parenchyma. With particularly virulent organisms, no major impairment of host defense mechanisms is needed; pneumonia may occur even in normal and otherwise healthy individuals.

More severe impairment of host defenses is caused by diseases associated with immunosuppression (e.g., advanced AIDS), various underlying malignancies (particularly leukemia and lymphoma), and the use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs.

The likelihood of particular agents is believed to be influenced by a number of modifying factors: the presence of coexisting illness, recent treatment with antibiotics, residence in a nursing home, and the severity of illness at the initial presentation. One issue that has sparked controversy is whether an attempt should be made to identify a specific etiologic agent, using Gram stain and culture, in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, or whether empirical therapy should be used based on the patient's risk factors, clinical characteristics, and local bacterial resistance patterns. If a specific pathogen is identified, modification of the initial antibiotic regimen is often appropriate, particularly to avoid an overly broad spectrum of coverage. Table 23 .1 summarizes the etiology and initial management of four broad subcategories of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The first group comprises patients who do not have coexisting cardiopulmonary disease or other modifying risk factors, who have not used antibiotics in the previous 3 months, and who do not require hospitalization. The most common pathogens in this group of patients include S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, respiratory viruses, and in smokers, H. influenzae. The preferred therapeutic regimen is one of the advanced-generation macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, but this recommendation is subject to local differences in rates of bacterial resistance. For example, in some regions of the United States, up to 45% of S. pneumoniae isolates are resistant to macrolides.",

Again, local resistance patterns of S. pneumoniae should be taken into account, and residence in a nursing home should be considered a factor that increases the risk of pneumonia caused by a gram-negative organism. Poor dentition (leading to an increased burden of anaerobic organisms in the mouth), problems with swallowing, or impaired consciousness increase the risk of an anaerobic aspiration pneumonia. Recommended options for the management of this group have included either an oral quinolone (used as a single agent) or a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic (e.g., second-or third-generation cephalosporin) given in combination with a macrolide (particularly an advanced-generation macrolide, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin). The third and fourth groups differ from the first two on the basis of severity of the pneumonia. The third group is defined by a need for hospitalization. The fourth group includes patients with the most severe disease, which necessitates admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). These patients still commonly have pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae or the other organisms found in outpatients, but with the additional concern for gram-negative bacilli, Legionella, and sometimes S. aureus. Therapy for these patients is adjusted accordingly (see Table 23 .1).

Human cases have occurred as a result of exposure to infected animals, contaminated animal products, and inhalation of aerosolized spores. The virulence and potential lethality of the organism are related to elaboration of a toxin that causes prominent edema, inhibits neutrophil function, and alters production of a number of cytokines. Whereas cutaneous anthrax results from spores introduced through a break in the skin, inhalational anthrax follows the inhalation of spores into alveolar spaces and the transport of viable spores via lymphatics to the mediastinal lymph nodes. Germination of the spores in the mediastinum is associated with toxin release and a hemorrhagic lymphadenitis and mediastinitis.",

            "text": "Clinically, patients with inhalational anthrax typically present with a flulike illness with symptoms of mild fever, myalgias, nonproductive cough, malaise, and chest discomfort. Several days later, they become acutely and severely ill with fever, dyspnea, cyanosis, septic shock, and often findings of meningitis. The most prominent abnormality on chest radiograph is mediastinal widening from hemorrhagic lymphadenitis and mediastinitis. Because viable spores are present in the mediastinum and not the alveoli, anthrax is generally not transmitted from person to person via droplet nuclei. Despite treatment with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline, mortality is extremely high after the onset of clinical illness, and public health guidelines have focused on prophylaxis (with either of these antibiotics) to prevent inhalational anthrax following confirmed or suspected exposure to aerosolized spores. An anthrax vaccine is available but requires a complex administration schedule and annual booster injections.",

However, plague is one of the conditions thought to be of major concern as a possible weapon of bioterrorism. The causative organism, Yersinia pestis, a gram-negative rod transmitted by fleas from rodents to humans, is still endemic in many parts of the world, including the southwest and Pacific coastal regions of the United States, the former Soviet Union, and focused areas in Africa, Asia, and South America. Infection through the skin disseminates to regional lymph nodes, leading to the clinical syndrome of bubonic plague. Infection of the lungs (pneumonic plague) can occur either secondary to bacteremic spread from skin or lymph nodes or via airborne transmission of the organism from person to person. Pneumonic plague is highly contagious through aerosolization of the organisms during cough.",

Although several different forms of clinical presentation may occur with tularemia, depending on the mechanism of transmission and the site of entry, pulmonary tularemia secondary to inhalation of F. tularensis is the primary concern for the use of this organism as a bioterrorist weapon. Pulmonary tularemia is characterized by patchy inflammation and consolidation of the lung parenchyma, sometimes with the enlargement of hilar lymph nodes and the development of pleural effusions. Patients develop fever, chills, malaise, and headache. Chest radiography shows patchy consolidation that may be accompanied by hilar lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions. Treatment consists of streptomycin, and mortality is estimated to be approximately 35% without treatment.",
