Recombinant nucleocapsid polypeptide expressed in bacteria with a histidine tag at the amino terminus has been used as antigen for developing an assay to detect IBV-specific antibody. This fusion protein was produced readily in bacteria and easily purified with a nickel column which bound to the histidine tag. Conditions were optimized for using these preparations for an IBV-specific ELISA. Although differences in optical densities could be detected between pre-immune and positive sera for the Ark, Mass, and Gray strains with antigen concentrations between 50 and 0.1 vg per well, the greatest differences could be detected with 3 and 1.5 vg of protein per well. Maximum differences in optical densities between pre-immune and positive sera were obtained using 2.4 vg per well of protein and sera diluted between 1:80 and 1:160. In addition, as little as 30 ng/dot of recombinant nucleocapsid consistently detected IBV-specific sera in immunoblot assays which have convenient field applications.",

IBV infection results in coughing, sneezing and rales, but also causes lesions in the reproductive tract and kidneys (Darbyshire et al., 1979) . Because thousands of birds are typically housed under one roof, IBV can affect large numbers within a short time. Rapid diagnosis and determination of immune status of a flock is critical in controlling outbreaks that result in severe economic losses in both egg layer and broiler facilities. With appropriate standards, enzyme immunoassays are accurate indicators of antibody levels to IBV and facilitate the monitoring of immune status in large flocks (Marquardt, 1981; Snyder et al., 1983) . Presently, inactivated virus is used as the coating antigen with the commercially available IBV ELISA kits. Whole virus purification requires propagating quantities of virus in eukaryotic systems and whereas the most reliable serodiagnostic reagents require highly purified antigen, purification of IBV with its highly glycosylated spike protein is difficult and expensive.",

Because it is highly conserved, sharing 94-99% identity among various strains and highly immunogenic, readily inducing antibody, as well as cytotoxic T lymphocyte immunity in chickens (Sneed et al., 1989; Seo et al., 1997) , nucleocapsid protein is a preferred choice for developing a group-specific serologic assay.

The membrane was treated with blocking buffer (5% non-fat milk dissolved in NaCl/Tris-Cl buffer) for 1 h, then reacted for 1 h with polyclonal sera diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer. The membrane was then removed from the apparatus, washed by flooding with NaCl/Tris-Cl/Tween 20 solution several times, before blocking again with blocking buffer and adding secondary antibody consisting of alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat antichicken IgG antibodies. The substrate NBT/BCIP (nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3 indolyl phosphate; Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MA) was used to detect antigen-antibody complexes.",

The strongly immunogenic and conserved nucleocapsid protein of IBV is preferred for identification of group specific antisera for IBV (Sneed et al., 1989; Williams et al., 1992) . The recombinant fusion protein is useful for serodiagnosis of IBV because it is inexpensively expressed in quantities that can be prepared as highly enriched antigen (Zhou et al., 1996) . These preparations of the Gray strain (Marquardt, 1981) . The successful application of ELISA for detecting and quantifying antibodies to IBV was first reported by Marquardt (1981) . Since then, IBV has been diagnosed by ELISA employing whole virus as the coating antigen. An ELISA differentiating serotype would predictably require conformationally intact spike antigen produced in a eukaryotic system with predictable glycosylation rather than a bacterial system, such as that used here for the nonglycosylated nucleocapsid protein. Monoclonal antibodies used in ELISA type assays are available for limited serotype distinction (Ignjatovic and McWaters, 1991) . Whereas the ELISA may be appropriate for diagnostic or clinical settings, it is not practical for field situations. The easy use of immunodot blots provides the basis for a more convenient and inexpensive serodiagnosis of IBV. In addition, the latter may be ideal for use in epidemiological surveys where the aim is to establish prevalence of IBV, or in post-vaccination monitoring of vaccinated flocks of chickens.",

The dot immunoblot assay easily distinguished reactions between positive and negative sera at even 30 ng per sample. The reactions between the fusion nucleocapsid protein and positive sera were highly reproducible and easily interpreted. The anticipated potential for widespread use will be determined with serological evaluations of large numbers of sera. As these results were based on convalescent sera taken from birds infected with experimentally maintained viruses of only four serotypes, the effectiveness of the reagent should be further tested with IBV strains of additional serotypes, with sera of field infected birds and with sera birds at varying times after infection. However, the broader application of this diagnostic strategy will be to develop serological assays using similarly expressed fusion proteins from other virus pathogens.",
