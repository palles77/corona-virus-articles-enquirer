The clinical impact of these newly discovered viruses remains unknown. The reported data clearly show that hMPV has been circulating for at least 50 years and has a definite clinical impact [2] . In addition, there is evidence to suggest that Boca is pathogenic [14] , but data from previous studies suggest that WUV and KIV on their own are not pathogenic [15] . The newly discovered HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 were previously considered to be pathogenic [4, 5] . We aimed here to study the prevalence of the newly discovered viruses hMPV, HCoV-NL63, Boca, KIV and WUV in RTI in Kuwait.",

The URTI included those of the throat (pharyngitis), nasopharynx (nasopharyngitis), sinuses (sinusitis), larynx (laryngitis) and trachea (tracheitis). World Health Organization criteria for LRTI in children were used [16] , and American Thoracic Society criteria were used for LRTI in adults [17, 18] . The specimens were collected in the hospital and processed in the Virology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University. The majority of samples were collected during autumn and winter. Autumn in Kuwait occurs between September and November and winter between December and March. To detect the presence of viral nucleic acids, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques were used.",

The peak season for WUV (1.1%, n = 3) and hMPV (2.5%, n = 7) was in February, and the peak season for Boca occurred in March (1.8%, n = 5). The positivity for KIV was consistent from October to January (0.4%, n = 1). The other respiratory viral infections were generally present throughout the year, reaching a peak during the winter months from October to February. This seasonal distribution of respiratory viral infections during the period from October 2010 to February 2013 indicates a high incidence in the winter months and a low incidence in spring and summer. Previous studies showed that hMPV infections appear to have a seasonal distribution. In the Philippines, peak positivity for hMPV infections occurred in March [22] . In Hong Kong, hMPV outbreaks were apparent during the spring/summer season [24] . In contrast, in Norway, hMPV outbreaks occurred during the winter season [25] . Other reports have suggested that hMPV may be circulating throughout the year [26] . Data from our study showed that hMPV infections appeared to have a seasonal distribution in Kuwait. The peak months were January and February, which indicated that hMPV was prevalent in the winter. A seasonal distribution of Boca was noted from December to June, especially during the winter/spring season, which is consistent with other studies [6, 27] . However, in China, the peak seasons were noted as being from June to No-vember, especially during the summer season [28] . In Canada, Boca activity did not seem to be associated with a specific time of the year [29] . A seasonal distribution of WUV was noted in summer, autumn and winter. KIV activity was detected only during the autumn/winter months from October to January. In contrast, in Japan, the peak seasonal activity of WUV and KIV was detected during the spring/early summer months [30] . This variety of reported seasonal distributions of WUV, KIV, hMPV and Boca infections suggests the presence of other factors that may affect the activity of these viruses throughout the year in different countries, such as temperature, humidity and precipitation.",
