In order to investigate the origin and function of this region and its occurrence in nature, the cDNA sequences of the 3' non-coding regions of three additional strains of IBV, Gray, Arkansas (Ark) 99 and Holland (Ho10 52, were determined and compared to the sequences of the Beaudette, KB8523 and Mass41 strains. Not only was this U-rich sequence absent from the 3' non-coding region of the Mass41 strain, it was also highly variable, especially in comparison to the highly conserved 3' non coding region downstream of this sequence. Computer anaIyses of the sequences adjacent to this hypervariable region (HVR) showed that the 3' end of the IBV genome was highly conserved downstream of this region, with 94.3 to 97.8% similarity. However, the similarities for the HVR ranged from 53.2% between Ho1152 and Ark99, to 92.8% between",

A similar U-rich region of 184 bases was found in the sequence of the Ark99 genome immediately downstream of the nucleocapsid gene where it had been described in the Mass-related strains. A 40-base synthetic oligonucleotide was synthesized that was complementary to the middle of this Ark99 U-rich region, and was labelled at the 3' end using \"2P-dCTP and terminal deoxy transferase (Sambrook et al., 1989) . Four IBV RNAs, Mass41, Ho1152 and 2 Arkansas isolates (ArkDPI-11 and ArkDPI-75) were applied to and baked on a nitrocellulose membrane.

RNA was resuspended in 7 ~1 deionized H,O (dH,O) and denatured in 6 mM methyl mercuric hydroxide for 10 min at room temperature. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using 5 units of AMV reverse transcriptase at 42\u00b0C for 2 h in the presence of 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (2MEI, 50 mM Tris pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 8 mM MgCl,, 0.8 mm dNTP, 20 pg/ml of 3' end primer (5' GGATCCGCTC-TAACTCTATACTAGCCTAT 3') and 20 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI). Following phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation of the RNA/cDNA hybrid, the RNA was eliminated by exposure to highly alkaline conditions at 37\u00b0C for 3 h. The cDNA was then neutralized, concentrated by ethanol precipitation, and amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was performed with the same 3' end primer as above and a primer from the upstream intergenic region (S'GAATI'CCCGCGTGTACCTCTCTAGTA 3') in the presence of 4 mM dNTP, 1 X Tuq buffer (1.5 mM MgCl,, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) and 0.5 ~1 Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT). The PCR was performed with a primary denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 30 s, extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and subsequent denaturation steps at 95\u00b0C for 1 min. A total of 30 cycles were used with a final extension step of 3 min at 72\u00b0C. Resulting PCR products were cloned into the pCRlOO0 vector, utilizing the single T overhang at the insertion site (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced using the Sequenase rit (USB, Cleveland, OH). Nucleotide sequences were processed using the GCG Seqed program and compared with the Gap and Bestfit programs. Sequences were aligned using Pileup and predicted secondary structures of the 3' non-coding region were derived from Fold and Squiggles.",

This HVR ranged from 184 (Gray1 to 196 (Ho11521 nucleotides in length and the nucleotide sequence homologies among the strains containing this sequence ranged from 53.2% to 92.8%, with the Ho1142 strain showing the greatest divergence (Table 1 ). The greater variability of the Ho1152 strain compared to the other strains in this region immediately downstream of the nucleocapsid gene would explain why this region was not detected with the Ark99 probe ( Fig. 1 ). In comparison, the non-coding region downstream of this HVR was highly conserved, ranging from 94.3% to 97.5% identity (Table 2 ). Fig. 3 shows a plot of the similarity of the nucleotide sequences of the 3' non-coding regions of all 6 strains of IBV. The HVR is clearly seen immediately after the nucleocapsid gene and can be compared to the remaining 3' non-coding region which has very high similarity scores. This HVR could be considered either an insertion or a deletion since it is not present in Mass41. However, the higher U content in comparison to the rest of the IBV genome suggests that it is of exogenous origin (Boursnell et al., 1985) . The fact that it has at least 53.2% identity among various strains suggests a common ancestry for this sequence.",

            "text": "If the IBV genome acquired the HVR as exogenous RNA, this region could be a site for recombination. Sequences upstream and downstream of the HVR were analyzed to identify any distinctive patterns which would suggest that this region is of functional significance, such as being involved in recombination. Not only are the sequences flanking the 3' HVR highly conserved, the 5' flanking sequence also resembles the cutting site (5' TTAA 3') of retrovius DNA and transposons TnlO and Tn3 (Shoemaker et al., 1980) . It was of special interest that a unique pattern, that may be of functional importance, was observed in the oligonucleotides flanking the HVR. Several nucleotides downstream of this 3' HVR were mirrored in the sequences upstream. That is, the same sequences were seen in reverse orientation on either side of the 3' HVR. An example can be seen in the Gray strain where the sequence TGAGAATG appears 5' of the HVR and the sequence 0.0-i s I I I,   I  I  I  I,  I  I  I  I,  0  I  I  I,  I  I  I,,  I  I  I   0  100 200 300 400 500 Position GTAAGAGT is in the 3' flanking sequence ( Table 3 ). The function of these mirrored sequences is unknown; however, they may be important in preventing folding of the RNA in this region, as mirrored sequences should prevent complementary base pairing. The sequence relationships of the 3' non-coding regions were examined with a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4) . The Ho1152 and KEC3523 strains were shown to be more distantly related to the other strains. The 3' non-coding sequences of Mass41, in spite of the absence of the HVR, appeared to be closely related to the Beaudette, and to a lesser extent to the Gray and Ark99 strains. The program used to determine this tree counts the absence of this whole HVR in Mass41 as the result of one recombination event, so only the remainder of the 3' non-coding region of the Mass41 strain was considered for the construction of the phylogenetic tree.",

There is no evidence as yet to show that this HVR has any effect on virulence or pathogenesis. There are no detectable protein products from the 3' HVR and no methionines with a preceding putative consensus ribosomal binding site. Since it is completely absent in the Mass41 strain, it would appear that it is not an absolute requirement for viral replication, at least for Mass41. Any specific function of this HVR apparently does not dictate that the sequences be highly conserved but its function may depend on the secondary structure of the RNA. The variability of this HVR as compared to the conservation of the remaining 3' non-coding sequences suggests that the primary sequence itself may not be as functionally important as its influence on the secondary structure of the 3' end of the genome. It is possible that the presence of the HVR may increase the comple~ty of the secondary structure of the RNA which could in turn affect its association with replication machinery, such as RNA binding proteins.
