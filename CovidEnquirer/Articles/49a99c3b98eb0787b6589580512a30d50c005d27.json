            "text": "Although conventional antimicrobial drugs have been viewed as miraculous cure-alls for the past 80 years, increasing antimicrobial drug resistance requires a major and rapid intervention. However, the development of novel but still conventional systemic antimicrobial agents, having only a single mode or site of action, will not alleviate the situation because it is probably only a matter of time until any such agents will also become ineff ective. To continue to produce new agents based on this notion is unacceptable, and there is an increasing need for alternative approaches to the problem. By contrast, light-activated molecules called photoantimicrobials act locally via the in-situ production of highly reactive oxygen species, which simultaneously attack various biomolecular sites in the pathogenic target and therefore off er both multiple and variable sites of action. This non-specifi city at the target circumvents conventional mechanisms of resistance and inhibits the development of resistance to the agents themselves. Photoantimicrobial therapy is safe and easy to implement and, unlike conventional agents, the activity spectrum of photoantimicrobials covers bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. However, clinical trials of these new, truly broad-spectrum, and minimally toxic agents have been few, and the funding for research and development is almost non-existent. Photoantimicrobials constitute one of the few ways forward through the morass of drug-resistant infectious disease and should be fully explored. In this Personal View, we raise awareness of the novel photoantimicrobial technologies that off er a viable alternative to conventional drugs in many relevant application fi elds, and could thus slow the pace of resistance development.",

            "text": "In the past 4 years, reports and positional statements from governments and regional and global health authorities have fi nally acknowledged the seriousness of antimicrobial drug resistance. [1] [2] [3] [4] Similar statements have been made and discussions undertaken very regularlywith plenty of well-reasoned arguments-among the scientifi c community during the past 25 years without any apparent acknowledgment from those wielding legislative powers. However, WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the European Commission, G7 Summit, and national governments among industrialised countries have now spoken with one voice, calling for changes in clinical practice and the rapid development of new approaches for infection control, and encouraging basic research. [1] [2] [3] [4] Unfortunately, this recent agreement does not mean that we can look forward to a happy future where infectious disease is concerned. [2] [3] [4] There is a desire among the various strata of health-care providersperhaps unstated, but there nonetheless-simply to have the failing antimicrobial drugs replaced with a brand new set. This desire is understandable given the ease of treatment associated with antibiotics when the microbes display no resistance, and a common belief remains that, in principle, we could return to the glory days of the antibiotic era as if nothing had changed. 5 However, we know that microorganisms can rapidly develop resistance against a variety of costly antimicrobial agents. 6 This problem largely derives from their single mode of action which, a large body of evidence suggests, is the reason that it is only a matter of time for microorganisms to develop ample resistance. 7 An improved approach to avoid future development of resistance is to focus on compounds with modes of action that interact with multiple targets. The potentially new antibiotic teixobactin appears promising in this respect because it can attack alternative targets in the face of resistance; however, this antibiotic seems to be mainly active against only Gram-positive bacteria. 8 Alternative safer and more effi cient antimicrobial strategies are urgently needed-including those with effi cacy against Gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, fungal, viral, and protozoal pathogens. 9 In this Personal View, we contend that the use of light-activated molecules (photoantimicrobials) 10 is a viable option that deserves to be fully explored. We discuss photoantimicrobials and their uses and prospects for adoption as mainstream clinical antimicrobials in the fi ght against conventional drug resistance.",

Raab's supervisors, von Tappeiner and Jesionek, applied this approach to tumour cells and reported their results in 1905. 12 Thus, both the antimicrobial and anticancer approaches of photodynamic therapy have been known for more than a century. Anticancer photodynamic therapy is now a clinical reality in hospitals and dermatology clinics worldwide, including for the treatment of actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma for more than 25 years, 13 but antimicrobial photodynamic therapy is still largely unappreciated by clinicians and bodies responsible for health-care provision. Figure 1 shows that photoantimicrobial discovery has been more extensive than that of conventional agents since 1900, with a substantial increase since the beginning of the so-called era of resistance.",

            "text": "The basic principle of the photodynamic antimicrobial concept is the combination of visible or near infrared light, Personal View oxygen, and a photoantimicrobial that is able to absorb and transfer energy or electrons after light absorption to molecular oxygen for the generation of reactive oxygen species (fi gure 2). Reactive oxygen species, such as singlet oxygen, superoxide anions, and hydroxyl radicals, have a broad spectrum of activity and can destroy numerous molecular microbial targets (eg, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids), 9, 14 which makes it very unlikely that the microbes can develop resistance. It is worth emphasising that internalisation of the drug is not a prerequisite for cell kill, which further prevents the onset of resistance 15 and has been observed in vitro via the repeated sublethal photosensitisation of bacteria. This mechanism of action neither selects for photoantimicrobial resistance nor does it alter sensitivity to conventional antibacterial drugs. 16 With respect to effl ux, the major classes of antimicrobial photosensitisers have been tested extensively in vitro with an array of knockout and overexpressed bacterial effl ux mutants. Only phenothiaziniums among the photosensitiser classes tested have been found to be effl ux substrates. 17 Despite this fi nding, the use of specifi c effl ux pump inhibitors can reverse the reduced phenothiazinium phototoxicity due to effl ux. 18, 19 Effl ux systems are central components for intrinsic antimicrobial resistance, but photoantimicrobial action requires three components (ie, drug, light, and oxygen): the phototoxic eff ect of light and subsequent production of reactive oxygen species constitute by default the mechanism of action, and are thus the primary target for resistance development. This mechanism of action The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can follow two alternative pathways after light activation by a given photosensitiser (PS). The PS can absorb a photon in the ground state, forming the excited singlet state. This state can undergo intersystem crossing to a longer-lived triplet state that might interact with oxygen by two mechanisms: in type 1, the generation of O 2 \u00b7 -, \u00b7OH, and H 2 O 2 by electron transfer from the excited PS; in type 2, the triplet state of the PS can directly undergo energy exchange with triplet ground state oxygen, leading to the formation of excited 1 O 2 . The generated ROS rapidly react with their environment depending on the localisation of the excited PS-eg, microorganism cell walls, lipid membranes, peptides, and nucleic acids. The PS returns to its initial state after this cycle, ready to absorb a new photon and generate additional ROS. O 2 \u00b7 -=superoxide anions. \u00b7OH=hydroxyl radical. H 2 O 2 =hydrogen peroxide. 1 Personal View provides photoantimicrobials with the unique competitive microbicidal advantage because the potential pathogen target, independently of whether it carries sophisticated effl ux systems or not, must cope with two alternative assaults thus minimising substantially the possibility of resistance development. 20 Additionally, effl ux systems are transmembrane proteins, and it is well documented that proteins are highly susceptible to the photodynamic eff ect. 21 Furthermore, potential resistance to the oxidative burst resulting from illumination might include enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, but these enzymes are ineff ective against singlet oxygen and are, indeed, inactivated by it. 22 Consequently, for example, Staphylococcus aureus or meticillin-resistant S aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae (whether or not carbapenemase-positive) or Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase and New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase-1 are each susceptible to cationic photoantimicrobials activated with harmless light (fi gure 2).",

Because of their chemical nature-a majority of the compounds are phenothiazinium salts, porphyrins, or phthalocyanines-the biocompatibility is high. This chemical property is also the case for natural product photosensitisers such as curcumin (approved as the food additive E100), 32,33 ribofl avin (vitamin B2), 34 and hypericin. 10 Activation of photoantimicrobials is simple, with use of low-powered lasers, light-emitting diodes, or conventional (halogen) lamps. With fi bre-optic technology, most regions of the anatomy are accessible. In many cases, loci of infection (ear nose and throat, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, urinary tract, or bowel) could be managed endoscopically, allowing local application both of the photoantimicrobial agent and light. Even for deep-seated infections a transcutaneous needle could deliver both photoantimicrobial agent and light via a fi bre. Additionally, the integration of plastic optical fi bres into textile structures enables uniform light distribution to complex geometries of the human anatomy. 35 Development of light-emitting bandages and wearable light-emitting garments is also underway. 35 It is worth remembering that the therapeutic use of light-activated pharmaceuticals was, until relatively recently, ubiquitous in dermatology departments for the treatment of psoriasis using psoralen ultraviolet A irradiation therapy. Ironically, this combination therapy is also photoantimicrobial. 36",

Because of the photocatalytic mode of action (a single photosensitiser molecule can generate as many as 10 000 molecules of singlet oxygen before it is destroyed), they kill microbes more rapidly and at much lower concentrations than biocides, and clinical management is simply achieved by controlling the dose of light administered. Furthermore, photoantimicrobials fulfi l the general criteria for new interventions to address the antibiotic resistance crisis-namely, preventing infection and resistance, preserving available antibiotics, slowing resistance, and developing microbe-attacking treatments with diminished potential to drive resistance. 7 Toxicity to the human host would-quite correctly-be a concern for any new antimicrobial agent, conventional Personal View or otherwise, but there are highly eff ective photoantimicrobials, such as gentian violet or methylene blue, that have been in clinical systemic use in people for more than a century with excellent safety records. For example, the systemic use of methylene blue has been extensively examined during its testing as a conventional antimalarial agent in sub-Saharan Africa. Systemic single human doses of methylene blue (10 mg/kg) have been used in conventional antimalarial trials. 37 This dose converts to a maximum concentration of 2000 \u03bcmol/L, whereas, for example, the minimum photobactericidal concentration for this photoantimicrobial against in-vitro S aureus or E coli is in the region of 20 \u03bcmol/L. It should also be noted that local, rather than systemic, administration is proposed. Moreover, healing of the tissue is known to be good after photodynamic therapy, 38 making photoantimicrobials a suitable choice for wounds or other traumatic infections (ie, acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections). An additional consideration is that in the treatment of many localised infections by photoantimicrobials, the photosensitiser is locally administered to the infected area but the red light that is then delivered diff uses and scatters well beyond the actual area of the infection. This red light can have a substantial benefi cial eff ect in stimulating healing and repair in the surrounding tissue by the process known as photobiomodulation or low-level laser therapy. 39",

In addition to presentations for which there is resistance to one of the standard drugs (usually isoniazid), there are increasing cases of multiple and extensively drug resistance, often associated with HIV comorbidity. Both multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant mycobacteria have been shown to be susceptible to photoantimicrobials in vitro. 59 Thus, despite overwhelming evidence, clinical trials have been few (table) . Only three photoantimicrobial agents (methylene blue, toluidine blue O, and indocyanine green) have so far received clinical approval, but only in dentistry as an adjuvant approach. 70 Unsurprisingly, the combinatorial use of photoantimicrobials with conventional drugs has received considerable attention.

US$2 billion of forward funding for antimicrobial resistance programmes has been suggested by the 2014 UK O'Neill Report, 74 whereas the 2016 US fi gure is $1\u00b72 billion. 75 It would be tragic if all that happens, should such funding be forthcoming, is that the current situation is maintained and funding goes solely to conventional antimicrobial development.
