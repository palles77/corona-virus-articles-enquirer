Lebowitz Geriatric psychiatric syndromes might serve as the starting point for a medical classification of psychiatric disorders, because their medical and neurological comorbidity and their clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging features often reflect specific brain abnormalities. Geriatric syndromes, however, consist of complex behaviors that are unlikely to be caused by single lesions. We propose a model in which aging-related changes in specific brain structures increase the propensity for the development of certain psychiatric syndromes. The predisposing factors are distinct from the mechanisms mediating the expression of a syndromic state, much like hypertension is distinct from stroke, but constitutes a morbid vulnerability. We argue that research seeking to identify both brain abnormalities conferring vulnerability as well as the mediating mechanisms of symptomatology has the potential to lead to a medical classification of psychiatric disorders. In addition, a medical classification can guide the effort to improve treatment and prevention of psychiatric disorders as it can direct therapeutic efforts to the underlying predisposing abnormalities, the syndrome-mediating mechanisms, and to development of behavioral skills needed for coping with adversity and disability.",

Effective treatment strategies depend on the physician's ability to identify a clinical picture with distinct underlying biological and nonbiological contributors that can be targeted with the available interventions. Despite the advantages of the medical diagnostic system, psychiatric nosology consists of phenomenologically defined syndromes that are either biologically heterogeneous or have unknown biological contributors. We argue that geriatric psychiatric syndromes, and geriatric depression in particular, can serve as the starting point for a medical classification in psychiatry, because they occur in the context of medical and neurological comorbidity and are accompanied by clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging findings pointing to specific brain abnormalities. This paper reviews relevant literature and proposes a model and a research agenda that might lead to a medical classification.",

            "text": "Historically, the DSM-III was created to provide an operational framework for the classification of clinical observations during an era in which diagnoses had previously been made on the basis of clinicians' individual views and even feelings. Indeed, the DSM-III and its successors revolutionized the field by creating a common language for clinicians to use in characterizing their patients. An equally profound change occurred in psychiatric research, where systematic assessment of psychopathology became standard practice. Like all landmark ideas, the DSM-III soon began to be used for purposes beyond its original raison d' etre; it became a nosology without a medical basis. One of the reasons for this development has been the absence of definitive knowledge of biological contributors to most of the major DSM syndromes.",

Phenomenology strives for syndromic homogeneity, although syndromic homogeneity is neither feasible nor desirable. First, use of the DSM-III or DSM-IV criteria results in nonhomogeneous syndromes, because different symptom permutations might qualify for the same diagnosis. Second, psychiatric disorders need not have homogeneous clinical presentations any more than medical illnesses do. Authoritative textbooks of medicine, like the Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, permit a variety of accompanying features in describing the clinical picture of medical illnesses, (e.g., pneumonia might be accompanied by dyspnea, fever). The typical presentation of a syndrome rarely occurs in all patients with the same medical illness (e.g., myocardial infarction without precordial pain is common among older adults). Some diseases are, in fact, characterized by their clinical heterogeneity. Syphilis has so many diverse clinical presentations that it once was referred to as the great imitator. The diverse clinical presentations of mycoplasma pneumonia led to the early term atypical pneumonia. Insistence on uniform clinical presentation can be counterproductive, because it might classify as \"non-syndromes\" conditions with common pathogenetic contributors. Nonetheless, improved understanding of specific contributors to the pathogenesis of a larger syndrome might provide information on specific symptoms. For example, subjects with frontrostriatal dysfunction and depression might exhibit executive function deficits, whereas individuals with an early-onset depression with significant genetic contribution might exhibit other clinical features.",

            "text": "Although medical/neurological comorbidity offers a research window to the brain, it is unreasonable to expect a direct lesion-syndrome relationship. There are at least five reasons for the absence of such a one-to-one relationship. First, the most likely brain abnormalities associated with behavioral disorders affect high-level neural systems. These systems are redundant and interactive. Unlike peripheral nerve lesions and, to a lesser extent, lesions of the internal capsule and some brain stem areas, lesions of high-level cortical and subcortical structures do not result in identical behavioral abnormalities. Neural system redundancy and plasticity might explain the heterogeneity in symptom expression, because other centers assume some of the function of the lesioned circuitry. In addition, the complex interactions among neural systems (lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior thalamus, anterior cingulate, subgenual cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and medial frontal cortex) might explain why different brain lesions or pathological processes can lead to similar syndromes. Moreover, there is evidence that differences in limbic-cortical activation are associated with differential response to antidepressant treatments; more limited limbic-cortical and cortical-cortical connections differentiate responders to cognitive behavioral therapy from responders to pharmacotherapy (Seminowicz et al 2004) . A second reason for a lack of a direct central nervous system (CNS) lesion-syndrome relationship is the contribution of non-CNS medical burden that, either directly or through the resultant disability, facilitates the development of psychopathology. Third, the premorbid competencies that each person possesses at the time of the CNS insult might influence the character and course of psychopathology. These can be behavioral (e.g., skills relevant to problem solving and dealing with stress) or cognitive (e.g., ability of a person to assess risks and benefits of specific situations and decisions and act accordingly). A fourth reason is that environmental adversity might lead to adaptation problems and enhance abnormal behavioral patterns. Environmental adversity needs to be viewed in the context of the individual's physical, behavioral, and cognitive skills, because a mild environmental change might overwhelm a person with underdeveloped skills. Finally, genetic make-up is an important contributor in early-onset depression, but also increases the risk of depression in patients with lateonset depression occurring after a brain insult (e.g., personal or family history of a depressive disorder has been shown to increase the incidence of post-stroke depression as much as, if not more than, the site of the vascular lesion; Morris et al 1992) .",

First, geriatric depression resembles medical diseases. Along with changes in mood, ideation, and behavior, geriatric depression is associated with peripheral body changes. These include the vegetative syndrome, but also hypercortisolemia, increased abdominal fat, decreased bone density, and increased risk for type-II diabetes and hypertension (Brown et al 2004) . Depression of older adults often is accompanied by cognitive impairments resulting from abnormally functioning neural systems; dysfunction of frontostriatal pathways, the amygdala, and the hippocampus have been implicated. In addition to CNS pathology, geriatric patients have multiple medical illnesses requiring treatment with agents crossing the blood-brain barrier, experience disability, and often are presented with difficulties in negotiating their environment. Each of these factors might contribute to the heterogeneity of the clinical presentation and the course of geriatric depression.",

Second, disorders compromising frontostriatal pathways are often complicated by depression. Subcortical dementing disorders, including vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are more likely to result in depression than cortical dementias (Sobin and Sackeim 1997) .

            "text": "Cognitive neuroscience studies suggest that dysfunction in certain parts of frontostriatal circuitry (i.e., the prefrontal cortices and the anterior cingulate) is relevant to the development of depressive symptoms. A model of the prefrontal cortex function proposes that this brain structure maintains the representation of an individual's goals and sends signals to other brain areas to facilitate the expression of task-appropriate response (Davidson et al 2002) . Such signals facilitate the expression of the most adaptive response to a stimulus at the expense of an immediately rewarding response. Theoretically, abnormalities in prefrontal circuitry responsible for positive affect-guided anticipation might predispose to some types of depression and result in failure to anticipate positive incentives. The left medial orbitofrontal cortex is activated in response to reward, and the right orbitofrontal cortex in response to punishment (O'Doherty et al 2001); both of these functions are relevant to depression. The anterior cingulate gyrus has connections to brain structures relevant to the expression of depressive symptoms and is responsible for functions that are often impaired in depression. Accordingly, the affective cingulate subdivision is connected to the orbitofrontal cortex, the amygdala, the lateral hypothalamus, the anterior insula, the periaqueductal grey, and some autonomic stem centers (Bush et al 2000; Ongur et al 1998a) . The affective cingulate assesses conflicts between current function and information with motivational consequences and integrates affective and cognitive information. The cognitive cingulate subdivision has connections with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate, the parietal cortex, and the supplementary motor cortex. Its principal function is to monitor competing responses and modulate attention and executive functions in collaboration with the dorsolateral cortex (Bush et al 2000; Whalen et al 1998) .",

            "text": "Frontostriatal dysfunction might influence the clinical presen-tation of geriatric depression. Among elderly depressed patients, those with executive dysfunction have more pronounced psychomotor retardation and reduced interest in activities than depressed patients without executive dysfunction (Alexopoulos et al 1997b Krishnan et al 1997) , a clinical presentation resembling medial frontal lobe syndromes. Nonetheless, depressed patients with executive dysfunction have sad mood, hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness of similar severity to that of depressed patients without executive dysfunction and meet criteria for major depression. Clinical and laboratory studies suggest that frontostriatal abnormalities influence the course of depression. Executive dysfunction, a clinical expression of frontostriatal abnormalities predicts slow, poor response Dunkin et al 2000; Kalayam and Alexopoulos 1999; Potter et al 2004; Simpson et al 1998) , and unstable response to antidepressants, although some disagreement exists (Butters et al 2004) . White matter abnormalities have been associated both with executive dysfunction (Aizenstein et al 2002; Boone et al 1992) and with poor outcomes of geriatric depression (Alexopoulos 2002; Hickie et al 1995 Hickie et al , 1997 O'Brien et al 1998; Simpson et al 1998; Steffens et al 2001) . Hypometabolism of the rostral anterior cingulate was reported in treatmentresistant depression, whereas cingulate hypermetabolism was associated with favorable response (Mayberg 2001) . Anterior cingulate activity is a predictor of the extent of treatment response in depressed young adults (Pizzagalli et al 2001) . Finally, increased left frontal error negative wave amplitude after a response inhibition task (mediated by the anterior cingulate) predicts limited or slow change in depressive symptoms in elders receiving citalopram treatment (Kalayam and Alexopoulos 2003) . Amygdalar Dysfunction. Patients experiencing their first depressive episode have larger amygdala volumes than patients with recurrent depression and healthy control subjects (Frodl et al 2003) . In contrast, decline in amygdalar volume has been documented in recurrent depression (Sheline et al 1998) . Along these lines, a hypermetabolic state of the amygdala has been associated with greater depressive symptoms and negative emotions (Drevets 1999 (Drevets , 2003 . It has been hypothesized that increased activation of the amygdala is a result of inadequate inhibition of this structure by prefrontal centers (Drevets 1999) . Thus, the combination of increased amygdalar metabolism with failure of cortical modulation of the emotional input might confer vulnerability to depression.",

Similar changes occur in experimentally induced sadness (Mayberg 2001) . So the expression of depressive symptoms might be mediated by a common pathway, but the predisposing factor, in this case, frontostriatal, amygdalar, or hippocampal dysfunction, might be unique to a subgroup of depressed patients.

Similarly, depression is common in patients with vascular risk factors and disorders resulting in subcortical lesions (Alexopoulos et al 1997a; Krishnan et al 1997) . Finally, proinflammatory cytokines, including interferon-\u2425, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u2423, and C-reactive protein are elevated during depressedstates (Schiepers et al 2005; Thomas et al 2005) .

Moreover, vulnerability-inducing brain changes might influence the course of illness (Figure 1) . Treatment Implications. Identifying neural systems whose abnormalities contribute to depression might guide pharmacological research in selecting candidate antidepressants for specific subgroups of depressed elders. For example, depressed elders with evidence of frontostriatal impairment might be candidates for dopamine enhancing agents, whereas use of such agents in a broader group of depressed patients might dilute the therapeutic signal and lead to the erroneous conclusion that dopaminergic agents have no antidepressant properties for any patients (Alexopoulos 2001) . Similarly, research might examine whether adjunct pharmacotherapy with agents enhancing the metabolism of frontostriatal structures (e.g., modafinil ; Scammell 2000) can improve the outcomes of depressed patients with evidence of anterior cingulate dysfunction. Although these approaches are sensible, their efficacy must be clinically tested. The reason is that direct lesion-to-syndrome relationships are unlikely in late-life depression. Moreover, even \"selectively-acting drugs\" have broader effects and change the function of systems other than those on which they exert their immediate action (Millan 2004) . Finally, treatment and prevention studies need to investigate the efficacy of behavioral approaches (e.g., problem solving therapy) that remedy behavioral deficits originating from executive dysfunction .",

Understanding these regional changes might also influence the selection of treatment, because new data suggest that cellular plasticity might be enhanced by antidepressant treatment in a way that intercedes in hippocampal loss by inducing regional neurogenesis (Kempermann and Kronenberg 2003) .

Discrete brain abnormalities, however, might predispose to a variety of behavioral syndromes, including psychosis, disinhibition, and delirium. For example, the presence of Lewy bodies in limbic and neocortical regions in patients with Lewy body dementia is thought to account for the neuropsychiatric symptoms of this disorder (e.g., visual hallucinations), whereas the more subcortical distribution of Lewy bodies observed in Parkinson's disease accounts for the predominance of motor symptoms (Barber et al 2001) . Along the same lines, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Parkinson's disease have different patterns of regional brain degeneration and present rather distinct behavioral pathology (Aarsland et al 2001) . Progressive supranuclear palsy leads to degeneration of many subcortical (e.g., the putamen, globus pallidus, caudate, and subthalamus) as well as orbitofrontal and medial frontal regions. In contrast, Parkinson's disease primarily leads to degeneration of mesocortical dopaminergic and other monoaminergic regions. Consistent with these regional differences is the greater likelihood of patients with PSP to develop disinhibition and apathy syndromes and of patients with Parkinson's disease to present hallucinations, delusions, and depression. Differences in behavioral pathology between PSP and Parkinson's disease persist even after accounting for the use of dopaminergic medications (Aarsland et al 2001) . Finally, discrete brain abnormalities might predispose to side effects, as in the case of Parkinson's disease, where degeneration of the mesocortical dopaminergic system might increase vulnerability to ldopa and lead to delirium.",
