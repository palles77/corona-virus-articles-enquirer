Outcomes have historically been poor for the vast majority of patients who lack a matched sibling donor. However, the development of haploidentical HCT (haplo-HCT) with high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has allowed for curative long-term potential with favorable transplantrelated outcomes, though this has not obviated the potential for graft rejection from human leukocyte antigen mismatch and repeated 2 red blood cell transfusions. Accordingly, multiple strategies have been developed to improve outcomes, the majority of which are based on the Johns Hopkins platform from 2012. Presently, we aim to discuss results from pertinent studies and compare outcomes with the two most recent approaches involving either thiotepa plus 200-cGy total body irradiation or 400-cGy total body irradiation.",

Clinical manifestations, while highly variable between patients, include debilitating pain from vaso-occlusive crises, strokes with associated disability, cardiopulmonary abnormalities, vision impairment, priapism in males, chronic kidney disease, hepatobiliary disease, osteonecrosis of long bones, splenic infarction, and an overall increased risk of infections complications [1, 2, [5] [6] [7] . Sickle cell disease also negatively impacts the health-care system in terms of cost and work productivity resulting from mental and physical disabilities [1, 2] . Current management strategies, most commonly hydroxyurea and red blood cell transfusion therapy as well as crizanlizumab and L-glutamine, are disease modifying rather than curative and are each associated with unique challenges that often potentiate multiorgan system disease [7] [8] [9] [10] . Gene therapy has been shown to be successful, though not available on a broad scale and is associated with potentially severe toxicities [11, 12] . As a result, the condition is presently incurable without allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) [7, 13, 14] . Historically, optimal HCT-related outcomes have been seen in children who receive myeloablative conditioning regimens followed by infusion of marrow allografts from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donors [13] . Cumulative data on over 500 children between the ages of 2 and 20 years who underwent matched related donor HCT are notable for sickle cell-free survival of 90%, transplant-related mortality of 6-7%, incidences of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) of 10-20% and less than 5%, respectively, and graft rejection rates of less than 10% [13]. However, patients have at most a 25% chance of having a matched sibling donor, and ethnic minorities have a 6-10% chance of finding a fully matched unrelated donor in the United States registry, meaning that most patients are ineligible for curative therapy, thereby necessitating the development of alternative donor platforms [15, 16] .",

Pioneering work in drug-induced immunologic tolerance with administration of high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has mitigated severe acute and chronic GvHD and reduced, though not eliminated graft rejection, a problem that is more severe in patients with transfusion-dependent hemoglobinopathies due to alloimmunization from recurrent transfusions ( Figure 1 ) [21] [22] [23] [24] .

Patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating bone marrow allografts followed by GvHD prophylaxis with PTCy, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil ( Figure 2 ). The results were favorable in that no transplant-related mortality was seen. In addition, 43% of patients had full myeloid chimerism and were off sirolimus at last follow-up. However, graft rejection occurred in 57% (8/14) of patients, reflective of inherent alloreactivity. Clinically, those who fully engrafted experienced resolution of vaso-occlusion, indicating the importance of mitigating graft rejection for improving transplant-related outcomes. Despite the high graft rejection rate, Bolanos-Meade et al. [20] demonstrated that less toxic nonmyeloablative regimens and haploidentical grafts with PTCy could reverse the sickle cell disease phenotype.",

Twenty-one included patients had sickle cell disease and two had transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The median age was 36 years. Participants were split into three cohorts that differed by doses of PTCy given (no PTCy, 50 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg, respectively), with the goal of determining the benefit of cyclophosphamide for improving engraftment rates. No patient had grades moderate-to-severe acute GvHD or severe chronic GvHD, which likely reflects that PTCy reduces alloreactivity. Furthermore, 86% (18/21) of the non-beta thalassemia patients survived, though 14% of patients with rejection (3/21) died. Engraftment rates and chimerism were highest in cohort three, though rejection was still 50% (4/8). One potential explanation is that the conditioning regimen was skewed toward tolerability rather than recipient immunoablation given the advanced age and increased number of comorbidities in the adult patients.",

The authors conducted a single-institution retrospective study on 10 patients (range, 20-38 years), with the first two receiving the regimen developed by Fitzhugh et al. [26] and the remaining eight receiving the Bolanos-Meade et al. [20] protocol with 3-Gy total body irradiation rather than 2 Gy as initially studied. The results provide evidence for a multiagent cytotoxic-based regimen rather than nonchemotherapy-based regimens alone, as the first two patients did not engraft while 88% (7/8) of the remaining patients did long term with over 95% donor cell chimerism at 1 year. One case of secondary graft rejection occurred. Rates of moderate-tosevere acute GvHD and extensive chronic GvHD were 25% (2/8) and 13% (1/8), respectively. Based on the findings, it was suggested that an increased dose of total body irradiation may contribute to improved engraftment, albeit at the cost of increased acute and chronic GvHD. While the Bolanos-Meade et al. protocol utilized nonmyeloablative conditioning to spare toxicity, Wiebking et al. [28] administered a myeloablative regimen with alemtuzumab, fludarabine, treosulfan, thiotepa, and cyclophosphamide with the goal of ablating the recipient immune system to reduce graft rejection (Table 1) . Notably, individuals did not receive total body irradiation. All three patients (age range, 8.5-20.3 years) included had disease that was refractory to hydroxyurea. The results were favorable in terms of absence of graft rejection, full donor chimerism, and absence of disease-related symptoms or GvHD at 11, 14, and 30 months posthaplo-HCT, respectively. While the small sample size limits generalizability and warrants validation in larger prospective clinical trials, the results highlight the impact of total body irradiation on long-term outcomes.",

            "text": "Sickle cell disease leads to age-dependent chronic organ dysfunction, resulting in decreased survival in affected individuals [4] . The main limitation for the application of HCT is principally donor availability and toxicity of conditioning. Initial approaches using a combination of recipient immunoablation with conditioning chemotherapy and total body irradiation appear too toxic. Thus, most affected individuals are not candidates for myeloablative conditioning due to age, comorbidities, including dosing issues related to renal or hepatic dysfunction, risks of infertility, especially for younger patients, and fear of developing acute or chronic GvHD, which remains one of the reasons that patients and family decline potentially curative therapy [17] [18] [19] 32] . Nonmyeloablative haplo-HCT appears to address these limiting factors. Since 2012, multiple approaches have been utilized to combat the primary issue associated with haplo-HCT with PTCy regimens, namely graft rejection, which is partially inherent to the high degree of alloreactivity in the setting of HLA mismatch compounded by alloimmunization from high numbers of transfusions [33] [34] [35] . Notably, patients in the de la Fuente et al. study had more comorbidities at baseline, namely moyamoya, cerebrovascular infarcts, and acute chest syndrome, compared with those in the Bolanos-Meade et al. study [30, 31] . Incidence of moderate-to-severe acute GvHD and subsequently chronic GvHD were also greater in the participants who received higher doses of total body irradiation.",
