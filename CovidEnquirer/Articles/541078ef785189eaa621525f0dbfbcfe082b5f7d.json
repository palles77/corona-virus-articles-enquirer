The preferred screening test at most transplant centers is the blood BK quantitative viral DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The sensitivity between the serum and urine BK viral testing is the same at 100%, but the specificity of serum testing is 90% versus 80% for urine testing. BK viremia is also a better predictor of BK nephropathy.",

However, there are increased laboratory surveillance and logistical labor. Antiviral prophylaxis, on the other hand, is more expensive and puts patients at risk for drug toxicity but is associated with decreased reactivation of other herpesvirus, lower rates of opportunistic infections, and allograft loss. The drug of choice for prophylaxis is valganciclovir. The duration of CMV prophylaxis depends on the CMV serology of the donor and recipient.

Ganciclovir is indicated in more severe disease, those with high viral load, or those with questionable gastrointestinal absorption. Treatment is usually continued until the viral load is undetectable for 2 weeks, then the patient is switched to 1 to 3 months of prophylactic therapy. If the viral load does not change with appropriately dosed ganciclovir after 2 to 3 weeks, then ganciclovir resistance should be assessed by viral genotype testing. If resistance is discovered, the usual strategy is to increase the ganciclovir dose or use foscarnet or cidofovir. However, these are nephrotoxic.

BK nephropathy is characterized by a tubulointerstitial disease pattern that closely resembles acute rejection.7. Besides nephropathy, can BK virus cause any other kidney problems?Yes. BK virus is associated with ureteral stenosis/strictures, which may lead to obstructive uropathy. Obstructions associated with BK virus usually occurs 2 to 4 months post transplant, whereas ischemiainduced stenosis usually occurs 1 to 2 weeks postoperatively.8.

Although the human polyomaviruses are highly seroprevalent in humans, they appear to cause clinical disease only in immunocompromised hosts. 3. The goal in treating BK-associated nephropathy is to eradicate the virus while maintaining kidney function and preventing acute or chronic rejection. 4. CMV-positive donor to CMV-negative recipient (CMV D1/R-) transplants are at greatest risk for severe \"primary\" infection during the first 3 months post transplantation. However, CMV D1/R1 group and not the D1/R-group has the worst graft and patient survival at 3 years. This could be secondary to increased vigilance in monitoring the CMV D1/-group. 5. Epstein-Barr virus can flourish in the setting of immunosuppression and is associated with the majority of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. 6. Live vaccines are contraindicated post transplant.",
