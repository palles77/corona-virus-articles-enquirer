Most studies have been using ambient monitoring data to estimate exposure. However, in case of PM, personal exposure is dominated by indoor sources especially taking into consideration that people spent up to 90% of their time indoor, thus the validity of using ambient concentrations as an exposure estimate may introduce misclassification. The risk of misclassification is less for gaseous air pollutants except in cases where a significant in-door source is present, e.g. nitrogen oxides. An alternative to ambient and personal measurement is the use of biomarkers to assess exposure, and a further advantage of these biomarkers is that they also reflect the timeactivity pattern.",

            "text": "The ultimate biomarker represents both an accurate exposure estimate and is also an indicator of health. Several biomarkers have been developed to assess exposure for genotoxic compounds in ambient air. Some of these biomarkers represent the exposure for specific compounds, e.g. benzene in blood and urine, and its metabolites, muconic acid and phenylmercapturic acid, in urine. However, the level of these products is not linked to the genotoxic effect. 1-hydroxypyrene (1-HOP) is another commonly used biomarker for PAH exposure although pyrene is not specific for ambient air pollution and can also be found in food. The carcinogenic PAH found to be associated with particles are metabolized to reactive molecules that can react with DNA to form bulky-DNA adducts. DNA adducts tend to be higher among subjects heavily exposed to urban and occupational pollutants (Autrup et al, 1999; Peluso et al, 2001) . PAH-DNA adducts have also been detected in the blood from newborns, whose mothers were living in polluted areas of Poland and China. The adduct level was similar in mothers and in the child (Perera et al, 2005) suggesting that carcinogenic agents present in ambient can pass the placental barrier and initate damage in the unborn child that is relevant for carcinogenesis. A positive association has been established between the level of PAH in ambient air and the bulky adduct level at medium to high level of PAH, but not at the low level situation generally observed at ambient pollution. A weak but positive association has been established between the bulky adduct level and risk of development of lung cancer (Peluso et al, 2005; Bak et al, 2005) Particles generated by combustion are composed of a carbon core to which other compounds such as metals and PAH adhere. The particles do induce oxidative stress mediated by a particle-induced inflammation causing macrophages to release ROS. Oxidative stress to DNA is frequently measured as 8-oxodG. In a study among human volunteers we found a positive association between individual PM exposure and 8-oxodG, whereas no association was found between amount of PM and bulky adducts (S rensen et al, 2003) . One of the consequences of DNA adducts, when un-repaired, is the induction of mutations that may ultimately induce cancer formation. An increased frequency of mutations in the p53 cancer suppressor genes has been observed both in the sputum of individuals exposed to smoky coal emission and in lung tumors from people in the region. The most frequently observed mutation seen in this group is a G to T transversion that is commonly associated with exposure to carcinogenic PAH (Keohavong et al, 2005) .",

Thus, stringent standards for new sources of air pollution (especially motor vehicles) will significantly improve air quality. However, the increasing economic welfare will result in an increasing number of vehicles and longer commuting distances, so the net benefits of these standards may be negligible. As the level of the pollution depends on the engine type and condition, fuel type, traffic congestions, driving habits and load of vehicles stricter control and introduction of cleaner technologies, e.g. hybrid cars. Furthermore, improved city planning to minimize traffic congestions and development of public transportation may help in minimize the air pollution in the megacities and improve the quality of life.",
