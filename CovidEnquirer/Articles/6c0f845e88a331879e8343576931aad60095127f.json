According to the WHO COVID-19 situation report-28 released on Feb 17, 2020, more than 71 000 cases have been confirmed and at least 1770 deaths.",

            "text": "In the SARS outbreak of 2002-03, 16-73% of patients with SARS had diarrhoea during the course of the disease, usually within the first week of illness. 3 SARS-CoV RNA was only detected in stools from the fifth day of illness onwards, and the proportion of stool specimens positive for viral RNA progressively increased and peaked at day 11 of the illness, with viral RNA still present in the faeces of a small proportion of patients even after 30 days of illness. 4 The mechanism for gastrointestinal tract infection of SARS-CoV is proposed to be the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor. 2 In the initial MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012, a quarter of patients with MERS-CoV reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea or abdominal pain at presentation. 5 Some patients initially presented with both fever and gastrointestinal symptoms before subsequent manifestation of more severe respiratory symptoms. 6 Corman and colleagues 7 found MERS-CoV RNA in 14\u00b76% of stool samples from patients with MERS-CoV. In-vitro studies have shown that MERS-CoV can infect and replicate in human primary intestinal epithelial cells, potentially via the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor. 8 In-vivo studies showed inflammation and epithelial degeneration in the small intestines, with subsequent development of pneumonia and brain infection. 8 These results suggest that MERS-CoV pulmonary infection was secondary to the intestinal infection.",

SARS-CoV RNA was found in the sewage water of two hospitals in Beijing treating patients with SARS. 12 When SARS-CoV was seeded into sewage water obtained from the hospitals in a separate experiment, the virus was found to remain infectious for 14 days at 4\u00b0C, but for only 2 days at 20\u00b0C. 12 SARS-CoV can survive for up to 2 weeks after drying, remaining viable for up to 5 days at temperatures of 22-25\u00b0C and 40-50% relative humidity, with a gradual decline in virus infectivity thereafter. 13 Viability of the SARS-CoV virus decreased after 24 h at 38\u00b0C and 80-90% relative humidity. 13 MERS-CoV is viable in low temperature, low humidity conditions. The virus was viable on different surfaces for 48 h at 20\u00b0C and 40% relative humidity, although viability decreased to 8 h at 30\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity conditions. 14 At present, no viability data are available for SARS-CoV-2.",
