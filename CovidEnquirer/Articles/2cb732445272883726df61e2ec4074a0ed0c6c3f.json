Anim. Feed Sci. Technol., Fifty Belgian white-blue male calves, purchased from the market at about 10 days of age, were divided into three groups. The basic diet was the same for all calves, and consisted of a restricted amount of commercial milk replacer containing 50 ppm zinc bacitracin and 20 pm virginiamycin, calf starter and grass hay. Weaning occurred when daily starter intake over 7 consecutive days averaged 0.5 kg. Maximum starter intake was restricted to 3 kg day -1, and grass hay was fed ad libitum. The experiment lasted 20 weeks. Group 1 (control) received the basic diet. Groups 2 and 3 were supplemented with either 2 g purified immunoglobulins (Ig) or 25-ml pooled colostrum (CO) twice daily, via the milk replacer as used in Group 1.",

Calves of Groups 2 and 3 received either 2 g immunoglobulins (Ig) or 25 ml pooled colostral milk (CO) twice daily, respectively, via the milk replacer during the initial 3 weeks. Milk replacer was composed of 60% skim milk powder in order to obtain an EEC subsidy for feed manufacturers, and contained 50 ppm zinc bacitracin and 20 ppm virginiamycin. Ig were isolated from whey by a dairy factory via column chromatography. Colostral milk was pooled milk from the first six milkings postpartum. Ig content averaged 44 mg ml-1. Calves were weaned when daily starter consumption averaged 0.5 kg over 7 consecutive days. Maximum starter allowance amounted to 3 kg per day, while grass hay was offered ad libitum. Chemical composition of the feeds and net energy content is given in Table 1 . Energy content of starter and hay was assessed as described by Cottyn et al. (1987) .",

From the seventh week, there was no impact on live-weight gain. During this period, a positive effect owing to the previous feeding of Ig and CO was hardly expected since the animal's own immune system begins to develop at about 3 weeks of age. For the 20 weeks of the experiment, daily live-weight gain averaged 0.84, 0.84 and 0.83 kg, respectively, for the three groups. There was no significant effect on weaning age. This is an indication that calf starter intake during the initial period of the experiment corresponded well between the three groups. Mean daily intake of dry matter and net energy (NE1) was similar for all groups. Consequently, this was also true for feed efficiency (Table 9 ).",

The relationship between initial serum Ig concentration and performance was small, when the data of the 44 surviving calves were pooled. The correlation coefficient between the serum Ig level at the start, and daily gain during the initial 6 weeks and the complete experiment amounted to 0.223 and 0.302. For the same periods, the correlation coefficients between Ig level and energy conversion were -0.180 and -0.004. It is possible that the serum Ig concentration analysed at the start of the experiment was not a true indication of the concentration at Day 1 after birth because of the finite half life of Ig and the fact that the exact age of the calves at purchase was not known.",

This can be explained by the fact that CO from the first six milkings post-partum was pooled. Based on the data of Stott et al. (1981) for pooled CO of six milkings post-partum, an average Ig concentration of 28.6 mg ml-1 can be calculated. As a consequence, the daily Ig administration in Group 3 ( + 2.2 g) was lower ;~55 than in Group 2.
