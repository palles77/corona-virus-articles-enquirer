In our study, expansion of the virus in Spain had not even entered the rising phase of the pandemic wave, which supports the hypothesis that, at least among healthcare workers, humoral immunity was acquired, probably as a result of repeated exposure to the virus. The volunteers participating in our study had a mean age of 36 years, which excludes the possibility that the humoral immunity acquired could have been related to historical exposure to the influenza A virus, as was the case with those born before 1957. 12 We also reject the hypothesis that immunity is related to prior vaccination for seasonal influenza virus, as its crossreactivity with pandemic virus is almost non-existent. 13 The high seroprevalence observed is coherent with the fact that these healthcare workers did not present a higher incidence of cases of influenza A despite their presumably greater exposure, as a result of their work, because although they were more exposed, the proportion of protected subjects would also have been higher.",

Methods: A survey study carried out during August 2009 (before the peak of the pandemic in Spain) in the Hospital Costa del Sol, a second level hospital with almost 300 beds in the South of Spain. The participants were workers in the following hospital units: Emergencies, Medical Area (Internal Medicine, Chest Diseases), Surgical Area (General Surgery and Anaesthesia) of any professional category. A study was made of the proportion of healthcare workers in our hospital with positive serology for the new influenza A (H1N1)2009 virus, as determined by the haemagglutination inhibition technique (\u22651/40).",
