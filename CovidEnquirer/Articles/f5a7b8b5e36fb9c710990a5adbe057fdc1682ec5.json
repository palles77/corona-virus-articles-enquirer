We analyzed bacterial and viral identification rates and classified infections according to epidemiological factors, such as Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage, mortality, and seasonal variation. Results: The numbers of AECOPD events involving only bacterial identification, only viral identification, bacterial-viral co-identification, and no identification were 200 (27.2%), 159 (21.6%), 107 (14.5%), and 270 (36.7%), respectively. The most common infectious bacteria identified were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.4%), and Haemophilus influenzae (5.3%); the most common viruses identified were influenza virus (12.4%), rhinovirus (9.4%), parainfluenza virus (5.2%), and metapneumovirus (4.9%). The bacterial identification rate tended to be higher at more advanced stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p=0.020 overall, p=0.011 for P. aeruginosa, p=0.048 for S. pneumoniae). Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were identified more in mortality group (p=0.003 for S. aureus, p=0.009 for K. pneumoniae). All viruses were seasonal (i.e., greater prevalence in a particular season; p<0.050). Influenza virus and rhinovirus were mainly identified in the winter, parainfluenza virus in the summer, and metapneumovirus in the spring. Conclusion: This information on the epidemiology of respiratory infections in AECOPD will improve the management of AECO-PD using antibiotics and other treatments in Korea.",

[6] [7] [8] Bacterial and viral infections have regional variability, and epidemiological characteristics should be considered during treatment. However, most previous analyses of bacterial and viral identification rates in AECOPD have been conducted in Western countries; [9] [10] [11] [12] studies in Asia are scarce and unclear.

Along with H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, in our study, P. aeruginosa was identified as a major AECOPD pathogen. Previous studies have found that P. aeruginosa identification rates increase with GOLD stage and that higher S. pneumoniae identification rates are associated with comorbidity. 17 Our results agree with these previous studies: we found that P. aeruginosa identification increased as the GOLD stage increased. The correlation between S. pneumoniae identification rate and GOLD stage seems to be due to high comorbidity at more advanced GOLD stages. The low identification rate of M. catarrhalis may be due to regional differences. For other reasons, M. catarrhalis may not be cultured better than other bacteria, so the identification rate may be low. New molecular diagnostic methods, such as nucleic acid amplification tests, antigen detection assays, and PCR assays, have revealed the importance of viral infection as a cause of AECOPD. Meanwhile, virus has also been identified as a major cause of exacerbation in AECOPD patients with low C-reactive protein levels. 18 Respiratory viral infections affect epithelial cells in the airway and lead to microvascular dilatation, edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and reduction of mucociliary clearance. 19 In previous studies of AECOPD, rhinovirus was the most commonly identified virus. 9, 20 In our study, influ-enza and parainfluenza viruses along with rhinovirus had the highest identification rates. The high influenza identification rates in our study are likely due to influenza epidemics in Korea in 2014 and 2015; 51 of the 91 events with influenza virus identification occurred during this time. These results suggest that rhinovirus is the virus most commonly identified with AECOPD unless there is another virus outbreak.",

When choosing antibiotics for use in patients with severe or very severe AECOPD, antibiotics with antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa should be considered. The prevalence of respiratory viruses is closely related to temperature and humidity. 22, 23 Korea has four distinct seasons, and worldwide, viral identification in AECOPD has shown seasonal variation. In our study, influenza virus and rhinovirus were detected in the winter, metapneumovirus in the spring and parainfluenza virus in the summer. Our results are consistent with a previous study conducted in Istanbul, in which metapneumovirus was prominent in the spring and parainfluenza virus was predominant in the summer. 24 Knowledge of seasonal virus prevalence will help in prevention and treatment of respiratory viral infections in AECOPD.",

On the other hand, bacterial infections in the airway can promote respiratory viral infection. 26 When the lungs are infected with P. aeruginosa, the tight junction between epithelium is damaged resulting in release of lactate dehydrogenase, destroying the lung barrier. 27, 28 Of the bacteria in our study, P. aeruginosa was most commonly co-identified with a virus.

Thus, we could not analyze the effect of influenza vaccination at the time of the influenza epidemic. Also, chest computed tomography was performed only in some cases, so it was not applicable to all events. Second, colonization could not be distinguished in the analysis of detection; in particular, it would have been advantageous if there had been previous or follow-up data from sputum culture. Third, influenza rapid antigen test was performed only in 247 (33.6%) events. Additionally, it was mainly performed only in the epidemic season. We think this would have affected the analysis of seasonal variation. Fourth, the phenotype of COPD might have a major impact on pathogen identification. However, through retrospective data, it was difficult to accurately identify COPD phenotype. Thus, we could not analyze according to COPD phenotype.
