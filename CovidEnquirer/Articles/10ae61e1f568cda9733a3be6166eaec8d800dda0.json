The disease is clinically manifested by respiratory distress, drop in egg production, poor egg quality in layers and some strains causes nephritis (Cavanagh, 2003; Cavanagh, 2005; Mahmood et al., 2011) . The disease may lead to loss of weight and predisposes to secondary bacterial infections that may be fatal (Cavanagh, 2003) . Initially IBV infects the respiratory tract, however, infections of kidneys and oviduct may follow (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003) . Also a shift of tissue tropism in the virus has been reported (Liu et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2004) , resulting in infection of a wide range of avian host species especially those reared close to domestic fowl. For example, IBV cases were found in Chinese peafowl (Pavo), guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), partridge (Alectoris) and teal (Anas) (Cavanagh, 2005) .",

Recent IBV infections in Sweden have been associated with poor growth in broilers, drop in egg production and thin egg shells in layers. The complete spike gene of selected isolates from IBV cases was amplified and sequenced using conventional RT-PCR. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons have shown that the recent isolates bear 98.97% genetic similarity with strains of the QX-like genotype. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that strains predominant in the nineties, which were of the Massachusetts type, have been replaced by D388/QX-like strains, however the evolutionary link could not be established. The homology between the two genotypes was 79 and 81%. Remarkably, a strong positive selection pressure was determined, mostly involving the S1 subunit of the S gene. This strong selective pressure resulted in recombination events, insertions and deletions in the S gene. Two new isolates generated from recombination were found with nucleotide sequence diverging 1.7-2.4% from the D388/QX-like branch, indicating the emergence of a new lineage. The study demonstrates a constant evolution of IBV that might be in relation to increased poultry farming, trade and vaccine pressure. The findings underscore the importance of continuous monitoring to control spread of infections, as well as to timely adjust diagnostic methods, molecular epidemiological studies, development and use of vaccines that are adapted to the changing disease scenario.",

The proximal two-thirds of the genome encode two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b that are translated into large polyproteins. These are then cleaved to generate 15 nonstructural proteins (Nsp2-16), comprising a main protease, an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and other nonstructural proteins that carry different functions in transcription and replication. The remaining third of the genome encodes four main structural proteins: the envelope protein (E), the spike glycoprotein (S), the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the membrane protein (M). IBV has two accessory genes 3 and 5 that express accessory proteins 3a, 3b and 5a, 5b, respectively. (Cavanagh, 2007; Pasternak et al., 2006) . Generally, the spike glycoprotein of the virus is translated as a pre-cursor protein (S O ) and later cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits. However, this cleavage of the spike glycoprotein is not observed in all coronaviruses (Holmes, 1990) . The spike glycoprotein of IBV consists of 1145 amino acids and its functions include attachment to the host cell, neutralization and induction of protective immunity (Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994; Johnson et al., 2003) . It is the most variable of the IBV proteins, with most of the variability mapping to the S1 part (Adzhar et al., 1997; Farsang et al., 2002; Keeler et al., 1998; Kingham et al., 2000) due to mutations or recombination in this segment.",

As a result, cross protection between serotypes is poor (Kuo et al., 2010) and changes as small as 5% in the amino-terminal half (S1) of the S protein have been shown to alter the protection ability of a vaccine (Cavanagh, 2003) .

Subsequent to introduction of vaccination, our study has found indications of outbreaks initiated by the vaccine virus (Farsang et al., 2002) .

The phylogenetic studies, based on the partial S1 gene regions, showed that Swedish IBV isolates from 1995 to 1999 were related to the Massachusetts genotype. The findings confirmed our previous observation (Farsang et al., 2002) . It is hypothesized that these genotypic variants have been reduced by vaccine and did not appear through diagnosis after 1999. The Swedish isolates from 2009 to 2010 were found to be closely related to other Western European isolates from comparison of sequences available in the GenBank especially to one isolate from The Netherlands (Fig. 2) .",

It was interesting that the Chinese QXlike genotype of IBV was isolated from a backyard flock in a Vladimir Oblast (Russia) where the prevalence of Chinese QX-like genotype was common and this region is close to Europe (Bochkov et al., 2006; Gough et al., 2008) . It is unclear how the QX viruses spread to Europe. There were more cases of QX-like virus infection with presentation of nephritis rather than proventriculitis, and false layers in mature hens reported from Belgium, China, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Russia, Taiwan and UK (Ammayappan and Vakharia, 2009; Beato et al., 2005; Bochkov et al., 2006; Worthington et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2004) . Similar type of IBV isolates has been reported in Israel and Korea (Meir et al., 2004; Park et al., 2005) . A QXlike strain in chicken associated with nephritis, rare proventriculitis and mortality was reported in Poland in 2006 (Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2006 . These results demonstrated that QX-like strains comprise new emerging IBVs and presented evidence of its involvement in epidemics in many countries.",

The lack of sufficient information in this aspect is limiting the comprehensible tracing of routes of infection in the continent. For example in Denmark QX-like IBV variants have been reported (Handberg et al., 2009 ) but the sequences of these viruses are not available in GenBank. There is a possibility that trade and import of day old chicks and poultry products from other European countries or indirect routes may have contributed to the spread of the QX-like strains in Sweden. The role of wild or migratory birds in dissemination of the IBV new variants still remained unclear. However, previous studies on other coronaviruses and IBV in wild birds have indicated a potential role of wild birds in dissemination of various coronaviruses, including IBV in Europe (Gough et al., 2008; Muradrasoli et al., 2010) .",

The investigations revealed that presumably, D388/QX-like viruses were introduced from other European countries through imports. Considering the number of investigated viruses, the present study provides the most comprehensive sequence data on IBV variants related to the D388/QXlike genotype, detected in Europe to date. Thus, the sequence data of this article will provide valuable reference for future studies on the evolution of genotypes, molecular epidemiology, improved diagnosis and on the virus-evolution in relation to vaccine development. Ultimately, the information provided in these studies, will contribute to a more effective control of IB, this viral disease in poultry of global importance.",
