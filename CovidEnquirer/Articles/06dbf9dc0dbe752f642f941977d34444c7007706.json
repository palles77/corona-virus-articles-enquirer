            "text": "Influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases endangering the health of humans, especially young children and the elderly. Although vaccination is the most effective means of protection against influenza, frequent mutations in viral surface antigens, low protective efficacy of the influenza vaccine in the elderly, slow production process and the potential of vaccine supply shortage during a pandemic are significant limitations of current vaccines. Adjuvants have been used to enhance the efficacy of a variety of vaccines; however, no adjuvant is included in current influenza vaccines approved in the United States. In this study, we found that a novel adjuvant, rOv-ASP-1, co-administrated with inactivated influenza vaccine using an aqueous formulation, substantially improved the influenza-specific antibody response and protection against lethal infection in a mouse model. rOv-ASP-1 enhanced the magnitude of the specific antibody response after immunization with low doses of influenza vaccine, allowing antigensparring by 10-fold. The rOv-ASP-1 formulated vaccine induced a more rapid response and a stronger Th1-associated antibody response compared to vaccine alone and to the vaccine formulated with the adjuvant alum. Importantly, rOv-ASP-1 significantly enhanced cross-reactive antibody responses and protection against challenge with an antigenically distinct strain. These results demonstrate that rOv-ASP-1 is an effective adjuvant that: (1) accelerates and enhances the specific antibody response induced by influenza vaccine; (2) allows for antigen sparing; and (3) augments a Th1-biased and cross-reactive antibody response that confers protection against an antigenically distinct strain.",

Thus, generation of crossreactive antibodies is important for developing a better influenza vaccine. In addition, TIV is not effective in the aged population; the protection rate in the elderly (\u226565 years) can be as low as 30-40% even when the vaccine-induced antibodies are specific for the circulating influenza strain [2] .",

It strongly promotes a Th2-type, but not a Th1-type, associated antibody response [7, 26, 27] . Our results above show that rOv-ASP-1 enhances predominantly the Th1-type IgG2c response. Importantly, a recent study suggested that the Th1 response induced by influenza vaccine plays a more important role in protection against influenza [28] . Therefore, we compared the abilities of rOv-ASP-1 and alum to enhance the Th1 (IgG2c) and Th2 (IgG1) antibody responses after immunization with TIV. B6 mice were immunized with TIV + rOv-ASP-1 or TIV + alum; two weeks after immunization titers of total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2c in plasma were determined by ELISA (Fig. 2) . Both rOv-ASP-1 and alum significantly enhanced total IgG levels compared to TIV alone (p < 0.05) with no significant difference in total IgG between rOv-ASP-1-vaccinated and alum-vaccinated mice (p > 0.05). The level of IgG1 antibody was significantly higher in TIV + alum group than both TIV alone and TIV + rOv-ASP-1 groups (p < 0.05). Notably, only TIV + rOv-ASP-1, but neither TIV + alum nor TIV alone, induced a significant IgG2c response to influenza vaccine. These results demonstrate that rOv-ASP-1 enhances both total IgG and IgG1 responses similar to alum, but elicits a significant influenza-specific IgG2c that is not seen with either TIV alone or with alum in primary immunization.",

            "text": "There are very few adjuvants approved by the FDA and commercially available for use in humans in the United States [6] . Recently, a protein with adjuvant properties, named rOv-ASP-1, has been discovered from the helminth parasite O. volvulus. It is a member of a family of proteins found in both free-living and parasitic nematodes [13] . The recombinant protein has a molecular weight of 24.9 kD and also has angiogenic activity in mice [13] . Our present study demonstrates that rOv-ASP-1 is a powerful adjuvant with immunogenic characteristics that may help overcome limitations of current influenza vaccines. rOv-ASP-1 significantly enhanced total IgG responses compared to immunization with TIV alone at each dose of influenza vaccine tested in our mouse model. Importantly, a low dose of vaccine administered with rOv-ASP-1 induced the total IgG response to a level as high as, if not higher than, immunization with 10 times higher dose of vaccine alone. These results demonstrate the potency of rOv-ASP-1 as an adjuvant to enhance the IgG response to TIV and to allow for dose sparing of TIV antigen. Antigen sparing is crucial when there is a pandemic influenza outbreak because the slow process and limited capacity of current influenza vaccine production does not always meet the sudden need for a large amount of vaccine.",

            "text": "Like other adjuvants, the mechanisms of enhanced immune response induced by rOv-ASP-1 are not fully understood. Recently, it has been reported that rOv-ASP-1 primarily binds to APCs and induces Th1-dominated pro-inflammatory cytokines [16] . Consistent with this finding, we observed that addition of rOv-ASP-1 to TIV enhanced not only total IgG, but more significantly the Th1 IgG2c response. Neither vaccine alone nor vaccine with alum induced detectable amounts of IgG2c. This difference in antibody response may be responsible for the difference in protection we observed after challenge with a lethal dose of influenza virus: mice immunized with influenza vaccine plus rOv-ASP-1 provided better protection than immunization with vaccine alone, which contrasts to the report that mice immunized with TIV plus alum suffer from more severe weight loss and have significantly higher virus loads in lungs than those receiving vaccine alone [28] . A recent study indicates that the Th1 response induced by influenza vaccine plays a more important role in protection against influenza infection [28] . Our results are consistent with this finding and further suggest that the Th1 response induced by influenza vaccine plus rOv-ASP-1 may play an important role in cross-protection against influenza infection.",

Our results indicate that rOv-ASP-1 can accelerate the generation of an IgG response after vaccination, resulting in high levels of antibodies one week after primary immunization. This is particularly advantageous during an unanticipated pandemic. In addition, the time window between the availability of appropriate vaccines and the start of a seasonal epidemic can be very short in some years due to delay in vaccine manufacture or early outbreaks. An accelerated response induced by influenza vaccine would offer a major advantage in these situations.",

Our results have shown that co-administration of rOv-ASP-1 can enhance the production of cross-reactive antibodies and confer protection against infection caused by a different influenza virus strain. It is unknown if this effect is due to the enhanced antibody response to the stalk region of HA. However, the lack of HAI positive antibodies against PR8 virus in plasma of mice immunized with TIV + rOv-ASP-1, but protection of these mice from subsequent PR8 influenza infection, suggest that the PR8 protection afforded by the vaccine plus rOv-ASP-1 may be not related to anti-PR8 HA globular head antibodies, but due to enhancement of cross-reactive antibodies targeting the HA stalk or other conserved antigenic sites.",

This is actually similar to what has been observed in the elderly population receiving TIV: they have low levels of antibody responses to the circulating influenza virus and show influenza symptoms when infected with influenza virus, but demonstrate less severe disease as indicated by fewer hospitalizations than non-immunized elderly who are infected with influenza [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . A secondary immunization of elderly with TIV annually is not a realistic public health strategy. However, if the cross-reactivity observed in our studies was demonstrated to be a broad based cross-reaction against multiple strains of influenza (e.g. all H1N1), influenza vaccination may not need to be annual if the duration of the cross-reactive protection afforded by two immunizations of TIV plus rOv-ASP-1 is shown to be long lasting. A booster immunization with TIV plus rOv-ASP-1 is possible since it could protect against multiple strains of influenza thus eliminating the need for annual immunization. Currently, we are testing if rOv-ASP-1 can enhance antibody response and protection against influenza in aged mice after TIV immunization and if the protection is long lasting.",

Importantly, rOv-ASP-1 enhances the protection afforded by an inactivated influenza vaccine after challenge with an antigenically distinct strain.
