In the present study, the standardization and validation of a one step, four tube reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (RT-LAMP) for rapid detection and serotyping of the DENV targeting NS1 gene using the Genie\u00ae II flourometer was carried out. The performance of the RT-LAMP was compared to RT-PCR, CDC 1-4 Real time PCR and the NS1 antigen ELISA, IgM and IgG anti DENV antibodies. Acute DENV infection was confirmed in 250/300 patients suspected clinically of DENV infection. RT-LAMP and CDC 1-4 Real time PCR assay was positive in 148/250 patients, while 92/250 patients were positive for anti-Dengue IgM and IgG antibodies. The RT-LAMP assay and the CDC real-time RT-PCR assay showed high concordance (k = 1.0). The detection rate of acute DENV infection improved to 96% (240/250) when the results of RT-LAMP were combined with NS1 Ag, IgM and IgG ELISA. The RT-LAMP had a detection limit of 100 copies for DEN-1 and DEN-2, 10 copies for DEN-3 and DEN-4 compared to 1000 copies for DEN-1 and DEN-2, 100 copies for DEN-3 and DEN-4 by the conventional RT-PCR. The assay showed 100% specificity. The RT-LAMP assay developed in this study has potential use for early clinical diagnosis, serotyping and surveillance of DENV infection in endemic countries such as India.",

            "text": "Dengue is a mosquito borne flaviviral infection, affecting the tropical and subtropical regions of the world and is one of the major emerging global public health problems. There are four antigenically distinct dengue virus serotypes DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4 and each serotype contains phylogenetically distinct genotypes (Teoh et al., 2013) . The Dengue virus (DENV) infection induces a lifelong protective immunity to the homologous serotype but confers only partial and transient protection against subsequent infection by the other three serotypes. Therefore, multiple and sequential infections with the four DENV serotypes would be expected for people living in a region where the infection is hyper endemic due to the lack of cross-protective neutralizing antibodies. Seroepidmiological studies have shown that the secondary infection is a major risk factor for Dengue hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) through antibody-dependent enhancement (Halstead et al., 1970; Monath and Heinz, 1996) . Diagnosis of DENV infection on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms is not reliable as more than half of the infected individuals either are asymptomatic or have a mild undifferentiated fever (Burke et al., 1988; Endy et al., 2002) . Early diagnosis of dengue infection can reduce the number of cases of DHF and DSS. Therefore, there is a great demand for the rapid detection of the infection and differentiation of DENV serotypes for timely clinical management and disease control, respectively.",

The serological methods are vulnerable to cross reactions caused by antibodies against related flaviviruses and are therefore not DENV-specific tests like DENV NS1 antigen and RNA detection methods. The detection of dengue specific secretory NS1 (non-structural protein 1), a highly conserved glycoprotein represents a new approach to the diagnosis of acute DENV infection, in recent times. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) directed against NS1 antigen (NS1 Ag) have demonstrated its presence at high concentrations in the sera of DV infected patients during the early clinical phase of the disease (Dussart et al., 2006) . Assays based on the detection of nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) tend to be specific for DENV infection. NS1 antigen levels correlate well with viremia and it circulates at high levels during the first few days of illness especially in patients with DHF. NS1 antigen remains circulating in patients' blood for longer periods than does viral RNA and is reported to be detectable even up to the 14th day of illness.",

            "text": "The first isothermal amplification methods introduced in 1990s included the transcription mediated amplification (TMA), nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) and the strand displacement amplification (SDA). The Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel nucleic acid amplification method and has the potential to replace PCR because of its simplicity, rapidity, specificity, sensitivity and cost-effectiveness without the need of specialized equipment (Notomi et al., 2000; Parida et al., 2005; Tomita et al., 2008) . The RT-LAMP assay is being increasingly used by various investigators for rapid detection and typing of emerging viruses (Chan and Fox, 1999; Mori et al., 2001; Parida et al., 2005) . These earlier reports, however, evaluated their RT-LAMP assays for the detection of DENV infection with a small clinical sample size (<100) and using the C-prM gene (Lu et al., 2012) or serotype-specific regions of the 3 untranslated region (UTR) (Parida et al., 2005; Li et al., 2011; Sahni et al., 2013) . The C-prM gene, however, was relatively less conserved among all the four DENV serotypes (inter-serotype) in comparison to the 3 UTR (Teoh et al., 2013) . However, we have targeted a highly conserved region of NS1, revealing >90% sequence identity among various genotypes within each serotype. As such genotyping of dengue serotypes can be done employing many gene including NS3 and NS5 (Klungthong et al., 2008) .",

The DENV NS1 antigen ELISA, a widely used test in recent times, is highly sensitive and specific (Young et al., 2000; Alcon et al., 2002) but it can be compromised by pre-existing NS1-IgG immunocomplexes in the acute stage of secondary DENV infection, a common feature in dengue endemic regions (Lapphra et al., 2008; Hang et al., 2009) . Although, WHO (World Health Organization, 2009) recommends the detection of DENV RNA, as the most effective diagnostic method in the acute phase of the illness, its use is limited due to lack of infrastructure and technical expertise. More recently, molecular techniques to detect virus genomic RNA sequence by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) are gradually being accepted as new standards over virus isolation for the detection of DENV in the acute sera (Lanciotti et al., 1992; Shu et al., 2003) . These PCR-based methods require either high-precision instruments for the amplification or elaborate methods for detection of the amplified products. In addition, these methods are often cumbersome to adapt to routine clinical use, especially in the peripheral health care settings and the private clinics (Parida et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Very few RT-LAMP assays have been described for the detection and serotyping of DENV. Recently Teoh et al. (2013) developed single tube RT-LAMP assay by targeting 3 UTR of DENV using nine sets of primers for serotyping of DENV. However no information on the serotypes detected from the clinical samples was reported in Fig. 6 . Phylogenetic tree of studied sequences with geographical strains of serotype 2 and 3 generated by neighbor-joining method. The tree is based on NS1 regions (nt 86-398 bp for DENV-2 and nt 128-397 bp for DENV-3) of the selected strains. this study. Our experience revealed that because of emergence of many genotypes across multiple DENV serotypes, the designing of pan-Dengue primers is an impossible task and is most likely to miss some genotypes. The reproducibility of RT-LAMP assay in this study was low and sensitivity was slightly lower than q RT-PCR. The specificity of the RT-LAMP assay developed by Teoh et al. was tested by single site restriction enzyme digestion that is not cost effective and also laborious. These reported methods for detection and differentiation of LAMP results were done by real time monitoring of turbidity (at 400 nm) with a Loopamp real-time turbidimeter, \"ladder-like feature\" on agarose gel electrophoresis and color change from orange to green caused by fluorescent detection reagent. However real time monitoring of amplification for the detection and differentiation of DENV serotypes in a fluorometer has rarely been reported. A few studies have reported the LAMP assay for rapid detection of viruses by real-time fluorometer (Genie II from Optigene, U.K.) (Mahony et al., 2013a,b) . In this study we established real-time fluorescence monitoring of isothermal method using simpler and less costly Genie \u00ae II instrument. The most common method for real-time fluorescence monitoring of LAMP reactions uses intercalating dyes such as SYBR Green (Maeda et al., 2005; Ohtsuka et al., 2005) . Fluorescence detection using intercalating dyes has the advantage of allowing further analysis in terms of the temperature at which amplification products melt or anneal. LAMP products contain structures of differing lengths containing catenated repeats of the target sequence which melt/anneal at a specific temperature determined by the length and G/C content of the target. After amplification, the reactions can be subjected to a gradual melting or annealing step with fluorescence monitoring to discriminate the specific amplification products from the non-specific artefacts in Genie\u00ae II instrument. This eliminates the need for gel electrophoresis or turbidity detection and allows for a closed-tube system thus reducing the cost of the assay. In our study the lack of overlap of T m allowed for the easy identification of all 4 serotypes of dengue.",

The DENV NS1serotype specific RT-LAMP assay developed in this study was significantly faster with a mean amplification time of 17 min compared with earlier studies (Parida et al., 2005; Sahni et al., 2013; Teoh et al., 2013) . The speed of the assay was probably due to the use of improved polymerase. This is the first report for evaluation of RT-LAMP employing NS1 region of viral genome with larger clinical samples size of 300 in a Genie \u00ae II flourometer. The performance of the RT-LAMP assay was validated by testing the samples simultaneously by the CDC real time PCR that is most sensitive and specific method for detection and differentiation of the DENV (CDC Dengue). Both the RT-LAMP and the CDC real time assay for detection and differentiation of the DENV showed comparable sensitivity (k = 1.0). The RT-LAMP scored over RT-PCR in terms of sensitivity and specificity and reproducibility compared with study done by Teoh et al.",

            "text": "In developing countries such as India where dengue is endemic and resources are limited, serological assays are most common methods used to confirm DENV infection. In our study using actual clinical samples, the NS1 antigen by ELISA was positive in 138/250 of patient's samples which were collected in acute phase of illness when antibodies were absent. The RT-LAMP or CDC Real time assay when used in combination with NS1 antigen and anti -dengue IgG and IgM Elisa increased the diagnostic coverage of febrile patients to 96% (240/250). This is in concordance to the study done by Teoh et al. (2013) . The most predominant serotype documented in this study was DEN-3 and DEN-2 which belonged to the genotype III and genotype IV respectively. Co-circulation of more than one serotype of DENV is also known to cause hyperendemicity (Dash et al., 2011) . The NS1 serotype specific RT-LAMP assay developed in this study may be utilized as a rapid, simple, easy, cost effective, isothermal, highly sensitive and specific field applicable technique for detection and differentiation of the dengue virus serotypes which overcomes the deficiencies present in existing techniques. Its applicability in tertiary care institutes is emphasized by its ability in viral quantification and evaluation of viraemia in patients. It can suitably be introduced in zonal/peripheral hospitals as an adjunct to existing immunological tests acting as parallel controls. The RT-LAMP assay in OptiGene Genie II instrument may be employed as the new gold standard for timely and accurate diagnosis and serotyping of dengue in the clinical care, disease surveillance, disease prevention, and control activities in endemic countries such as India.",
