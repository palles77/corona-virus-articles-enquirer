Timely identification of a specific pathogen can lead to either cessation of antibiotics or directed antibiotic therapy, delivered in a timely manner. 3 Rapid and accurate diagnosis can play a key role in optimising antimicrobial stewardship outcomes. Rapid testing may also improve use of respiratory isolation rooms, either by appropriate isolation of patients with a respiratory pathogen, or early discharge from isolation for patients with a negative test result. 2 There is some evidence that rapid testing for respiratory viruses decreases duration of antibiotic use, 2,4-7 hospital length of stay (LOS), 8, 9 and isolation bed LOS, 2,3,10 particularly for patients with influenza viruses. However, these findings have not been uniform and may be impacted by the type of population (e.g., paediatric vs adult), underlying comorbidities, clinical setting, prevalence of influenza versus other respiratory pathogens and whether other respiratory infections (e.g., bacterial pneumonia) are present. 9, 11, 12 There are a few studies that have specifically examined the impact of broad respiratory pathogen panels, finding favourably in terms of hospital resource utilisation and improved clinical management; 2,6,13,14 however, most of these studies have been performed in the paediatric hospital setting.

The Biofire FilmArray Respiratory panel is a cartridge-based multiplex molecular assay capable of detecting 20 targets including influenza A (H1, H1-2009 and H3 strains), influenza B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, adenovirus, coronavirus (HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43), human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. There have been several studies demonstrating high clinical and analytical sensitivity and specificity compared to standard diagnostic testing algorithms. 1, 15 Prior to the introduction of the FilmArray panel, a National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) approved in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detecting influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus was in routine use for detection of respiratory viruses. Primers and probes for influenza A were supplied by Biosearch Technologies (USA). RNA was extracted using a commercial kit (EZ1 Advanced XL BioRobot; Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and run on the ABI7500 (Applied Biosystems, USA). Up to eight samples can be processed in a single run.",

A time and motion study was done to record hands-on laboratory work time, with timing of each step of both assays recorded on a standardised CRF. For the time and motion study, laboratory staff members used a timer or stopwatch to record the time in minutes and seconds for each step. For the in-house PCR this included recording the total time for accession, setting up specimens for extraction, preparing samples for amplification, reading and reporting results. Since the in-house PCR assay was batched, the total time for each individual specimen in the study was calculated by dividing the overall time for the entire batch by the number of samples in the batch.

We unexpectedly found very little difference in hands-on work time per specimen with the inhouse PCR compared to the highly automated cartridgebased FilmArray assay (11.5 vs 10 min per sample). This is likely because the batched nature of in-house PCR testing increases workflow efficiency. It should also be noted that the measured median 10 min hands-on work time for FilmArray is very different from the 2 min claimed by the manufacturer. Although FilmArray is low complexity, the individual cartridge-based nature of testing meant that a single specimen had to be attended to several times by a scientist (for accession, set up, PCR loading, PCR result reading, LIS reporting and clinical results notification). During the present study the cost per individual cartridge for the FilmArray assay was AU$150. In comparison, the approximate cost for the in-house PCR was AU$25 per sample. Given this cost difference, it is unlikely that the FilmArray respiratory panel testing could be justified on cost grounds for routine clinical samples, in the absence of evidence that the testing results in improved patient care or clinical outcomes.",

Our present study was powered to detect a clinically significant difference in both hospital and isolation LOS which was determined a priori as a minimum of 10 h. Another retrospective study in adults, conducted at the New York Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Centre, reported reduced hospital LOS in patients testing positive for influenza A after controlling for confounding factors. 4 The median TAT in this study for reporting positive results from the FilmArray results was 1.5-1.7 h; this shorter TAT (compared to the TAT in our current study of 4.4 h) may have increased its impact on health service outcomes.

Interestingly, in a retrospective study in children at Cohen Children's Medical Centre (NY), FilmArray implementation resulted in a significant increase in use of isolation precautions (34 per 100 patient days compared to 15 per 100 patient days in the preimplementation period), 6 suggesting that implementation resulted in more appropriate use of patient isolation rooms, potentially preventing hospital transmission of respiratory targets.",
