Adaptation to prolonged ozone (Or) exposure occurs in the tracheal epithelium of rats and is marked by the presence ofciliated cells with uniform short cilia but is not accompanied by shifts in cell populations, altered characteristics of epithelial secretory cell products, increased cell turnover, or elevated tracheal superoxide dismutase activity. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that adaptation is a result of alterations intrinsic to epithelial cells or to the cells and their matrix, and not due to systemic or neural influences. Rats were preexposed to either filtered air (FA) or 0.96 ppm O3 for 8 hr/night for 60 days, and then their tracheae were removed and exposed to 3 ppm O3 in an explant culture system where behavioral, nasal, exudative, and secretory product influences can be eliminated. After exposure to 3 ppm 0, in vitro, quantitative electron microscopic evaluation demonstrated that the epithelia from the FA preexposure group had significantly more necrotic cells and sloughed cells and fewer ciliated cells than the epithelia from the Or preexposure group. Thus previous exposure to ozone in vivo induces a change in tracheal epithelium which confers resistance to ozone-induced injury in the explant exposure system.",

Previous morphologic evidence of adaptation to ozone exposure has been derived from evaluation of the centriacinar region of the lung in experimental animals and in-eludes demonstration of acute ozone-induced injury followed by reduced rates of cell division, decreased numbers of inflammatory cells, and fewer cytologic alterations in epithelial cells with continued exposure (Boorman et al., 1980; Eustis et al., 198 1) . Numerous biochemical studies of lung tissue from rats, mice, and monkeys have shown acute degenerative changes such as oxidation of sulfhydryl-containing compounds and inhibition of enzyme activities due to acute highlevel ozone exposures, and conversely an adaptive enhancement of reducing compounds and an increase in enzyme activities following subacute low level exposures (Delucia et al., 1972; Mustafa and Tierney, 1978; Mustafa et al., 1982; Elsayed et al., 1982;  0041-008X/88 $3.00 Copyright 0 1988 by Academic Press, Inc.

A recent study in our laboratory (Nikula et al., 1988) has shown adaptation (defined as diminution in cell damage during prolonged exposure) of tracheal epithelium in rats exposed to 0.96 ppm O3 for 60 days. Possible mechanisms of adaptation include behavioral changes or alterations in the nasal cavity causing a decreased dose of ozone to the trachea, biochemical changes such as the induction of superoxide dismutase systems as has been reported in the lungs of oxygen-exposed (Crap0 et al., 1980; Freeman et al., 1986) and ozone-exposed rats (Jackson and Frank, 1984) , shifts in cell populations (Dungworth et al., 1975) , an increased epithelial turnover resulting in a new level of equilibrium between cell loss and replacement (Barry et al., 1985) an increased amount or altered characteristic of secretory products, or exudation on the airway surface of albumin-rich fluid which might protect underlying tissues (Reasor et al., 1979) , and a decrease in the cellular surface area exposed to ozone.",

The most striking change induced by 60 days of ozone exposure was the presence of ciliated cells with uniform short cilia.

Short-cilia cells were cells with cilia of uniform but less than 2.9 pm length, with no other evidence of injury. There were no apparent differences in the density or basal body structure of these cilia compared to those of undamaged ciliated cells. Damaged-cilia cells had sparse, broken, irregular cilia. Cells with apical basal bodies, arranged either regularly or irregularly, but lacking cilia were also placed in this category. Degenerate cells were those with several membrane-bound cytoplasmic vacuoles which measured greater than 1 pm in observed cross section. They contained electron-dense material and resembled autophagosomes, multivesicular bodies, or residual bodies. Cells with electron-dense, condensed nuclei and extremely electron-dense or vacuolated and lucent staining cytoplasm were identified as necrotic cells and categorized according to cell type, unless they lacked discernible identifying features in which case they were labeled unidentified necrotic cells. Occasional cells with only a small nuclear profile, little or no cytoplasm, and lacking distinguishing features were categorized as unidentified cells. Necrotic cells which were located along the luminal surface of the epithelium, but not within the epithelium, were counted separately as sloughed cells. Many of these sloughed cells had features (cilia, basal bodies, nuclear characteristics) which identified them as ciliated cells, but not all sloughed cells could be identified as to cell type. After the 24-hr explant exposures no material resembling secretory product was seen still attached to the luminal surface.",

The other major change was the significant decrease in the numerical density of ciliated cells in the epithelia from the FA preexposure group. In order to express the degree of ciliated cell damage relative to the population at risk, the ratio of abnormal ciliated cells (short-cilia, damaged-cilia, degenerate, and necrotic ciliated cells) to the total ciliated cell population was calculated (Fig. 4) . This ratio is significantly greater in the FA preexposure group compared to the O3 preexposure group. The large proportion of ciliated cells damaged by the explant O3 exposure in the FA preexposed group is especially apparent when the existence of the short-cilia cells in the O3 preexposed epithelia is taken into account (Fig. 4) .",

If the decreased density was simply due to the ciliated cells loosing their cilia thus becoming difficult to identify, then the unidentified population would be expected to increase.

In this experiment, the tracheal epithelium from animals previously exposed to ozone or filtered air was isolated from the whole animal, thus removed from systemic and neural influences, and then exposed to ozone. The results suggest that previous exposure to ozone induced a change in the tracheal epithelium which confers cellular resistance to ozone-induced injury. The explant exposures exclude the possibilities that adaptation of the tracheal epithelium is due to behavioral modification by the animal, altered nasal absorption of 03, or changes in inflammatory mediators or exudates from more distal airways. The adaptive response must be a local phenomenon intrinsic to the epithelium, the glands, or associated connective tissue. Integration of the results of our recent inhalation exposure study and this combined inhalation and explant exposure study allows several conclusions to be drawn concerning adaptation of the tracheal epithelium to prolonged ozone exposure. Tracheae from rats exposed to O3 for 60 days in vivo did not have evidence of increased epithelial turnover detectable by thymidine labeling, nor was there increased superoxide dismutase activity. Carbohydrate histochemistry and quantitation of epithelial cell density indicate that neither shifts in cell populations nor altered characteristics of secretory products account for adaptation (Nikula et al., 1988) . The results of this explant exposure study suggest that increased amounts or altered characteristics of secretory material do not account for adaptation, since it is likely that, due to the culture condi-tions, secretory material would be washed-off the tracheal epithelium and diluted by the culture medium. and thus would not cover and protect the underlying epithelium.",

In rats exposed to O3 for several days, increased activities of lung GSH peroxidase, GSH reductase, and glucosed-phosphate (G-6-P) dehydrogenase have been observed, leading to the proposal that the increased activity of GSH peroxidase catabolizes lipid peroxides formed during ozone exposure, while the increased activities of GSH reductase and G-6-P dehydrogenase provide increased levels of GSH and NADPH, respectively (Chow and Tappel, 1972) .
