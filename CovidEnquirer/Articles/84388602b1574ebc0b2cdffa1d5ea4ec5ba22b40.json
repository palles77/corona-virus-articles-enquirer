Materials and methods: From 2010 to 2018, 735 hospitals and clinics participated in four types of PGYD project including hospital as the single training institution (project A), clinic as the single training institution (project B), hospital as the main training institution in the joint training group (project C), and clinic as the main training institution in the joint training group (project D).

Under the strategy and policy of \"improving doctor training and upgrading medical quality\", the Ministry of Health and Welfare has implemented the post-graduate year training program (PGY) since 2003 trusted with the Joint Committee of Taiwan (JCT) to conduct the related training. The licensed dentists in Taiwan should finish the post-graduate year training program for dentists (PGYD) before they can open a dental clinic since 2010. 1, 2 Japan has implemented the post-graduate clinical training for dentists since 2006 and the training span lasted for one whole year. The clinical training system designed for the dental institution is divided into two categories: the single and the group systems. In the single system, only one hospital or clinic is responsible for holding the training program, whereas in the group system single hospital or clinic serves as the overseers of the total dental training program and welcomes the participation of several clinical dental training institutions as the collaborating training institutions. 3 According to the Japanese research, the post-graduate clinical training for dentists is mainly charged by the dental school hospitals in the group system with a considerate large number of collaborative training institutions. Due to the policy support, the number of dental clinic joining the training program in the form of collaborating institutions has gradually increased annually. Besides, dental clinics serve as the manager either in the single or the group training system has increased quite some number over the years. Moreover, only 19 of 47 administrative sections in Japan contain university-level hospitals, thus it causes great regional bias on the geographical distribution of the dental training institutions. 4, 5 The two-year post-graduate medical training program for the dentists in Taiwan was similar to that of the Japanese system. It consisted of both the single and the group training systems and centered by one hospital or clinic as the main training institutions, which led to a similar system as that of Japan on the typology of training institutions. Moreover, there were 7 dental schools or dental departments in Taiwan owning specialized dental training programs, which had great regional bias as Japan did. Only 3 of 20 administrative regions in Taiwan contain university-level hospitals that are concentrated in 3 administrative regions such as Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung Cities.",

Japan was 4 years earlier than Taiwan when it came to the post-graduate clinical training for dentists.

Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to analyze the project and institution types and the geographical distribution of the PGYD training institutions in Taiwan from 2010 to 2018. The subjects of this research were the qualified PGYD training institutions in Taiwan from 2010 to 2018.",

From the website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, we obtained the name lists of dental training institutions qualified for the PGYD. The project span proposed in 2010 was 2 years. However, the qualified and passed projects were announced in 2011. Therefore, only one year was left to carry out for the passed year-2010 projects and they needed a supplementary application for one more year. Besides, from the Joint Committee of Taiwan's website, we found the qualified name lists in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018 with the project span of 2 years in a row. These data revealed the types of project (single system or collaborating institution), the title of the medical institutions (the name of the certain hospital or dental clinic), the code name of the medical institution, the types of the institutions (main or collaborating), and the administrative region in Taiwan. Because in some years the administrative regions were not shown in the name list, this study utilized the Medical Institution Inquiry System and the name code to search and obtain the basic information of the registered medical institution so that the administrative region can be identified.",

According to Japan's research, it indicates that since 2006 implementation of the PGYD, more and more dental clinics have participated in the PGYD. The dental clinics are mainly in the group system collaborating with the hospitals to serve as the training institutions, mostly joining the system as a single or the manager role of the group system. The number is increasing yet small. If we take a further look to see whether the number of dentists joining the PGYD increases as the number of the clinics joining the PGYD increases, the answer was no evident effect. Based on the previous research, those dentists who are trained in the clinics within the single or group system can gain more patients, obtain more opportunity for clinical treatment, and have a higher level of training satisfaction. 6, 7 Thus, the researchers suggest that in order to raise the number of dental trainees in the clinics, more dental clinics shall be promoted to serve as the main training institution or the managing institution for the PGYD program. 8 Based on the Perry's research experience on the clinical training of dentist graduates serving in the community dental clinic, his research showed the positive effect of dental students on conducting their clinical training at the community dental clinics. The internship has made the students realize the importance of community dentistry; meanwhile they can learn the new techniques and use it into dental practice and gain the boost in confidence and problem-solving techniques as well as their preparation for future dental practice. 9 However, Harden et al. have proposed that from the educational perspective to take community as the basics, the training in the dental clinics has its importance. 10 In the dentist human development and the planning on the talents' supply and demand in 2020 issues by Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare, it presents advice from the policy side: the PGYD training items and the weights of community service shall increase. Trainees should participate in the mobile community health care service and this provides a suitable item for clinical training in the dental clinics. 11 Ever since the implementation of the PGYD, the number of dental clinics becoming as the collaborating institutions in the joint group indeed grew rapidly. However, the dental clinics mostly joined the program as a single training institution or as the main training institution in the joint training group. Though the number is increasing yet it accounts a large share compared to the total number of institutions, which is similar to Japan. As for the question whether the number of dentists trained by PGYD increases as the number of dental clinics increases in PGYD, the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan has not announced the total number of dentists being trained under the PGYD. This part deserves further investigation and research endeavors.",

This was something quite different from that in Japan. In Japan, the university hospital plays the main role as the managing institution and a large number of collaborating training clinics join its training program. This explains why the number of dental clinics joining the training program as collaborating partners is increasing. 8 In comparison, Taiwanese dental clinics were mostly the collaborating training institutions in the joint training group. The joint PGYD training groups were formed by dental clinics and hospitals that were not medical centers. Because medical centers generally shoulder the mission of training the dental specialists, it is not easy to make rotating schedule for the dentists-inetraining to shift between the main training institution (mostly hospitals) and the collaborating training institution (mostly dental clinics).",

Only 3 out of 20 administrative areas have the same level of training institutions as those of Japan's dental school hospitals. If we examined the geographical distribution of the main and collaborating training institutions in 2010 when at first the PGYD implemented, there were less training institutions in number and they mostly concentrated in the urban areas on the western side of Taiwan from northern, central to southern parts of Taiwan. Keelung City was the only city in the Northern Taiwan that lacked the training institution.

In the eastern part of Taiwan, the medical institution of certain scale could afford to join the PGYD and often as the role of main training institutions. Up to 2012, although there was an increase in the numbers of main and collaborating PGYD training institutions in Taiwan, most of the newly-increased institutions were located in the western part of Taiwan. The urban area had higher density of training institutions that also showed a wide geographical distribution. In contrast, the number of training institutions in the eastern counties did not change significantly and the Taitung County even lacked a proper dental training institution. The reason behind such phenomena was that it was not easy for eastern hospitals to recruit intern dentists. In addition, the qualified dental training institutions might lack the motivation to apply for the PGYD program. In the following 2014, it was still a great leap in the number of overall main and collaborating training institutions. Keelung City started to have its own training institutions, while Taitung County remained none. On the contrary, the collaborating PGYD training institutions scattered over all the administrative areas in Taiwan.",

It was due to the scarcity of dental training institutions in these counties. The number of main training institutions ranged from 1 to 3 while the collaborating training institutions ranged from 3 to 5. A large increase in the number of PGYD training institutions was found in the western administrative areas in Taiwan, most of them concentrated in the urban districts and the number of increased institutions exceeded more than 10. Overall, although the numbers of training institutions in most areas of Taiwan had a significant growth, the obvious increase was majorly found in the Northern Taiwan but not the Southern Taiwan. In addition, there was a strong evidence showing that most of the training resources still gathered in the northern urban areas in Taiwan. Similar to the situation in Japan, the geographical distribution of Taiwan's PGYD training institutions did not show the tendency of degrading. However, it is still worth for further discussion and research whether the distribution of training institutions has an effect on the subsequent development of dental practice in remote areas of Taiwan. Besides, according to Japan's research, the training program in the dental school hospitals normally have more than 100 positions of PGYD training quota while the clinics generally can accept less than 10 dentists for PGYD training. In Taiwan, a large number of dental clinics often participated in PGYD as collaborating training institutions, and these dental clinics were relatively small in size and many of them could only allow one dentist for the PGYD training. Thus, we cannot deduce from such phenomena that a large number of dental clinics have become the collaborating training institutions and it is not sufficient to reflect a proportional increase in the PGYD training positions. Moreover, there is still no study discussing the actual number of dentists in the training institutions.",
