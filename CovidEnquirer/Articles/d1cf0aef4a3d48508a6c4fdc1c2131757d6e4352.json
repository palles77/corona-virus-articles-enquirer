In an age when both noninvasive and minimally invasive approaches and techniques have increased, it is important to revisit the role of the biopsy in the diagnosis of infection (Box 2.1). Isolating microorganisms in the microbiology laboratory is a sensitive and accurate approach to their identification, but it has several important limitations. First, it cannot distinguish infection from colonization, nor can it ascertain the significance of the isolated organism. Only the presence of an organism in situ, together with an expected inflammatory response by the host, constitutes acceptable evidence of its role in infection.",

This means that many sections may need to be examined before a pathogen is identified. Although few surgical pathologists would balk at the idea of ordering additional sections to exclude malignancy in a biopsy they deemed suspicious, it is not uncommon for a pathologist to examine only a single histochemically stained tissue section in the diagnostic process of infection. 4 More egregious is the fantasy that the causative infectious agent will eventually be diagnosed by the microbiology laboratory, so there is no need for the surgical pathologist to belabor the process. This approach is wrong minded for several reasons. First, the microbiology laboratory may fail to identify a causative organism. 5 Second, the organism isolated by the laboratory may not represent the actual infective agent in vivo. The analogy is the role for Gram staining of secretions in chronically intubated patients to determine whether there is a neutrophilic exudate consistent with infection and whether there is a predominating organismsteps that can promote the choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy. 6 In this setting, undue emphasis on culture results can lead to a seemingly endless process of adding or eliminating antibiotics in patients who are merely colonized by bacteria and not actually infected. Treatment decisions that do not take into account the host response and dominating organisms will tend to favor the production of increasingly antibiotic-resistant isolates and may potentially compromise public health. This is only one of several compelling reasons to consider diagnostic biopsies in patients with infections in situations that do not readily yield to noninvasive approaches.",

The inflammatory response in infection is a function of the host response, which is in turn a function of (1) the anatomy of the affected organ, (2) the virulence factors produced by the infective agent, and (3) host immunocompetence. The surgical pathologist must be aware that a single species of microorganism may be capable of evoking a variety of different patterns of inflammation. An example is the broad spectrum of disorders produced in response to infection with Aspergillus spp., which ranges from benign colonization, to hypersensitivity responses, to malignant angioinvasive infection. 8 The characteristic types of inflammation elicited by infection ( organisms that normally elicit granulomatous inflammation may instead evoke histiocytic infiltrates. 5. Eosinophilic inflammation. This is seen in response to multicellular parasites and certain fungi ( Fig. 2 .5). 6. Cytopathic changes. Although this is not properly a type of inflammation, cytopathic changes do reflect a response to viral infection. Nuclear inclusions are part of the response to DNA viruses, whereas cytologic inclusions are seen with some RNA and DNA viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus ( Fig. 2.6 ). 7. Null responses. In the setting of profound immunosuppression, one may not see inflammation; only the uninhibited growth of microorganisms is apparent ( Fig. 2.7 ). This classification schema is only a crude approximation because overlap patterns of inflammation are common, as with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, granulohistiocytic inflammation ( Fig. 2.8) , and granulomatous inflammation with tissue eosinophilia (Fig. 2.9 ). The primary didactic element is that careful consideration of the histologic response in situ can help to narrow what would otherwise be a very broad differential diagnosis and can also provide invaluable information concerning host immunocompetence. For this reason, surgical pathologists must develop expertise concerning the inflammatory patterns that can accompany reduced immunocompetence resulting from genetic factors, age, toxins, and drugs, because they can skew the expected pattern of inflammation and at times confound the diagnosis.",

Nonspecific staining, although generally fewer than 1 dot per 10 cells, could be significantly higher, making it impossible to distinguish true from nonspecific signal. Poor RNA quality could undermine the assay, and rapid formalin fixation is often necessary for optimal preservation of RNA. Finally, although in theory the assay is capable of detecting a single transcript, most successful clinical-grade bISH assays express several hundred target RNA transcripts per cell.",
