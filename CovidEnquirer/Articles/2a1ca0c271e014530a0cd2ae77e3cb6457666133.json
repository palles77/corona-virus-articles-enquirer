To evaluate this usefulness, we measured TG mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma after total thyroidectomy by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA as an internal control. Surprisingly, we detected TG mRNA in all samples obtained after total thyroidectomy, including those from 4 medullary carcinomas. Further, there was no statistical difference in expression levels of TG mRNA in the patients with or without metastasis, and no significant correlation was found between serum TG concentrations and the expression levels of TG mRNA. These results give rise to a question regarding the clinical applications of not only RT-PCR detection but also quantitative measurement of TG mRNA in peripheral blood.",

The monitoring of serum thyroglobulin (TG) by immunoassay can be used in detecting residual or recurrent differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) after total thyroidectomy. However, the usefulness of this method is limited by both the requirement for thyroid hormone withdrawal to attain optimal sensitivity and interference by antithyroglobulin antibodies (Singer et al, 1996) . Recent reports have demonstrated that the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used to detect circulating cancer cells in the peripheral blood of patients with malignancies such as prostate cancer (Ghossein et al, 1995) and neuroblastoma (Mattano et al, 1992) .",

While serum TG was detectable in all the patients with metastasis, it was undetectable in 14 of 29 patients without metastasis. Further, serum TG was undetectable in all 4 patients diagnosed with medullary carcinoma, while quantitative measurement of TG mRNA was possible (Figure 3) . These results suggest that serum TG is a superior marker of distant metastasis of DTC than TG mRNA in peripheral blood.

The copy number of GAPDH mRNA was simultaneously measured, and the expression levels of TG mRNA were calculated as the ratio of TG and GAPDH mRNA. The results are shown with mean \u00b1SD for triplicate determinations either follicular or papillary structure. Serum TG immunodetection measurements are currently the best available indicator of tumour metastases, even though their diagnostic usefulness has several limitations. Circulating tumour cells can be detected by sensitive PCR amplification of tumour-specific abnormal gene sequences or through the detection of tissue-specific abnormal gene transcripts normally absent in the peripheral blood. Thyroid tumours represent the ideal target for such studies because they actively express tissue-specific markers such as TG and TPO. Despite promising reports in 1998 on the detection of TG mRNA in peripheral blood, our preliminary study showed that TG transcripts were detectable in all samples tested, including the ones from healthy subjects. Recently, 2 studies suggesting limitations in the clinical applications of this method have been reported. Wingo et al have detected TG transcripts in the peripheral blood of healthy subjects that can be measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Wingo et al, 1999) . Bojunga et al have found that TG mRNA expression is not specific to thyroid tissue and is not correlated with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer in patients, and they have recommended further examination of this method by quantitative measurement (Bojunga et al, 2000) . We therefore decided to re-evaluate this method using samples obtained from patients after total thyroidectomy, in which TG transcripts in the circulating thyroid cells from the normal thyroid may be negligible. We detected TG transcripts in all the samples tested, even in that of the patient diagnosed with medullary carcinomas, in whom the circulating of thyroid follicular cells was not likely to occur. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay confirmed the expression of TG mRNA in these samples, in which an increase in the fluorescent signal from hybridized TG cDNA-specific probe was observed.",

For example, in one patient, the copy number of TG mRNA in 1 ml of peripheral blood was comparable to that in over 300 pg total RNA from normal thyroid tissue, which is approximately equal to 30 thyroid cells. It is hard to believe that this many thyroid cells still circulated in the peripheral blood of a patient after thyroidectomy without any evidence of a distant metastasis, which could be a source of circulating cells. TSH receptor mRNA, which has previously been considered to be expressed only in the thyroid, was found to be expressed in adipocytes and lymphocytes (Francis et al, 1991; Endo et al, 1995) . The TG mRNA detected by our study thus might not have been derived from thyroid cells; instead, it is most likely that lymphocytes express small quantities of TG mRNA, as they are known to express various kinds of mRNAs such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (Lafarge-Frayssinet et al, 1989; Coutelier et al, 1994) , which used to be considered tumour-specific. Further, the expression of TG mRNA is not likely to be limited to thyroid follicular cells, as we have recently found it to be expressed in cell lines derived from lung or gastric carcinomas (data not shown). Possibly, the regulation of TG mRNA expression in lymphocytes is controlled by some unknown factors. If so, the detection of TG mRNA is not likely to become an alternative means of achieving early detection of recurrent thyroid carcinomas because sensitive detection of recurrence would be interfered with by basal expression of TG mRNA in peripheral blood.",

In fact, our results showed no statistical difference between the samples from patients with or without distant metastasis. Further, we obtained no evidence that this method is superior to the conventional measurement of serum TG, as it was hard to utilize the TG mRNA data to differentiate the patients with metastasis from those without, whereas serum TG measurements showed more than 5 \u00b5g l -1 in all patients with distant metastasis, and the high values of interassay CV in the quantitative measurement of TG mRNA can be a disadvantage in the follow-up of a patient for a long period. Moreover, TG mRNA and serum TG measured in the same samples showed no significant correlation. These results suggest that the sources of TG mRNA and serum TG might be different, and, as discussed above, the former might not be derived from thyroid follicular cells.",
