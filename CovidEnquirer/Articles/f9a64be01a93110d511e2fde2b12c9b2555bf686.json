            "text": "On average, 12.5 million (61%) of the 20.4 million children in the United States who are younger than 5 years of age were enrolled in a regular childcare arrangement during the spring of 2011. 1 Group childcare settings can increase the frequency of certain infectious diseases and amplify outbreaks of illness (Table 3 .1). Aggregation of young children potentiates transmission of organisms that can produce disease in other children, adult care providers, parents, and community contacts. Children newly entered into group childcare are at especially high risk of enteric and respiratory tract infections. However, mothers whose children were enrolled in group childcare before 2.5 years of age reported their children had less frequent respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections and episodes of otitis media during elementary school years. 2 A longitudinal repeated-event analysis of 3963 newborns followed for 8 years found that children who were enrolled in childcare at <2 years of age had more episodes of wheezing in the first years of life; however, among those children without older siblings, wheezing episodes and steroid use between ages 4 and 8 years were reduced compared with children who were not enrolled in childcare at an early age. Overall, early childcare was not found to be protective against asthma symptoms, airway hyperresponsiveness, or allergic sensitization when children were assessed at 8 years of age. 3 An increase in antibiotic use as an attempt to facilitate earlier return to care enhances the potential for emergence of resistant organisms, thus resulting in an increased economic burden to individual persons and society. [4] [5] [6] Despite the challenges of frequent respiratory and gastrointestinal illness exacerbations among children enrolled in group childcare, these arrangements facilitate opportunities for socialization and enable primary caregivers to be employed outside the home.",

Types of facilities can be classified by size of enrollment, age of enrollees, and environmental characteristics of the facility. Grouping of children by age varies by setting, but in organized care facilities children usually are separated into the following groups: infants (6 weeks through 12 months), toddlers (13 through 35 months), preschoolers (36 months through 59 months), and school-aged children (5 through 12 years). These designations have relevance to infectious disease epidemiology as well as regulation and monitoring. Most nonrelative care provided in an organized care facility is subject to state licensing and regulation, whereas care by a relative in a child's or provider's home is usually not subject to state regulations and monitoring.",

            "text": "Enteric viruses are the predominant cause of diarrheal syndromes among children in group childcare. 7 Outbreaks of diarrhea occur at a rate of approximately 3 per year per childcare center and are associated most frequently with organisms that cause infection after ingestion of a low inoculum. These organisms generally are transmitted from person to person and include rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, enteric adenovirus, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium, Shigella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, other Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), E. coli O114, and enteropathogenic E. coli. These fecal coliforms and enteric viruses contaminate the environment with greater frequency during outbreaks of diarrhea. In a prospective study of acute gastroenteritis in childcare centers, viruses isolated from the stool of children with diarrhea also were detected on environmental surfaces in 45% of outbreaks. 8 The inoculum associated with diarrhea, the attack rates, and the frequency of asymptomatic excretion of organisms for common enteric infections in childcare settings are shown in Table 3 Several features of norovirus facilitate its spread, including the low inoculum required for transmission (approximately 18 to 1000 virions), asymptomatic shedding that can precede and extend beyond symptom duration (in up to 30% of infections), tolerance to a wide range of temperatures that facilitates persistence on environmental surfaces, and strain-specific immunity. 24 Outbreaks can occur in a variety of settings including childcare centers, long-term care facilities, hospitals, restaurants, and cruise ships. Two epidemiologic studies of norovirus gastroenteritis in Germany and Japan found that genogroup GII strains predominated in outbreaks associated with childcare facilities while these strains were circulating in the community. 25, 26 Hepatitis A Virus. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections usually are mild or asymptomatic in children, and outbreaks in childcare centers generally are not recognized until illness becomes apparent in older children or adults. The first outbreak of HAV infection in a childcare center was reported in 1973 in North Carolina, 27 with subsequent outbreaks recognized throughout the US. 28 Before routine immunization of children with hepatitis A vaccines in the US, approximately 15% of HAV infections were estimated to be associated with childcare centers. Uptake of universal hepatitis A immunization in children has correlated with a decreasing proportion of outbreaks among children in childcare and elementary school settings, as well as among adults who have contact with children enrolled in childcare centers. 29, 30 Peak viral titers in stool and greatest infectivity with hepatitis A occur during the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms. HAV infections are transmitted in the childcare setting by the fecal-oral route and occur more frequently in settings that include diapered children. The mainstays of prevention of HAV infection include maintenance of personal hygiene, hand hygiene, disinfecting procedures, and immunization.",

An epidemiologic study of non-O157 STEC outbreaks in the US found that 15 (39%) occurred through person-to-person transmission, with 13 (87%) of those occurring in childcare centers. 35 In an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 infection in a childcare center in Bronx, New York, 11 of 45 attendees tested positive for E. coli O157:H7 by stool culture or Shiga-like toxin assay. 36 The original source of the outbreak was not determined; however, multiple sanitary violations were identified, including improper disinfection of diaper changing tables, lack of sanitary distribution of food, and inadequate exclusion of attendees who had diarrheal illnesses. After 2 cases of STEC were identified at a childcare center in Norway, an outbreak investigation found 9 additional cases among the 91 children enrolled and 1 case among the 41 employees; no evidence of common exposures was found, and person-to-person transmission was determined to be likely.

In contrast, in a multicommunity group childcare outbreak of Shigella sonnei, the highest attack rates were noted in rooms where both toilet-trained and diapered children were co-mingled (14%) compared with rooms with toilet-trained children only (9%) and rooms with diapered children only (5%), despite comparable availability of sinks and toilets. 18 The likely reason for this finding was that the toilet-trained children were acquiring continence, and the diarrhea resulting from their shigellosis made them incontinent. Investigators in North Carolina demonstrated that adherence to proper diapering and hand hygiene practices and use of dedicated food preparation equipment decreased the incidence of diarrheal illness among children and staff in out-of-home childcare centers. 19 ",

[55] [56] [57] In addition to preventing respiratory tract illness, influenza vaccine prevents acute otitis media among children attending childcare, as shown by several studies. 50, 51, 58, 59 Routine use of intranasal influenza vaccine among healthy children can be cost effective and can be maximized by using group-based vaccination approaches. A prospective study of intranasal influenza vaccine in healthy children 15 through 71 months of age demonstrated clinical and economic efficacy when vaccination efforts were focused on children in group childcare settings. 60 Vaccinating children has been associated with indirect protection of older people as well. 60, 61 Mandatory influenza vaccination before childcare attendance can increase immunization coverage and consequently decrease infection. In 2010, Connecticut became the second state, after New Jersey, to require all children 6 to 59 months of age in licensed childcare programs to receive at least 1 dose of seasonal influenza vaccine annually. 62 Seasonal influenza vaccination rates among children 6 to 59 months of age in Connecticut increased from 68% in 2009 to 2010 to 84% in 2012 to 2013. Connecticut also was compared with the 10 other sites participating in the CDC Emerging Infections Program, none of which had an influenza vaccine mandate for childcare centers at the time. Between the 2007 were associated with illness in a community outbreak of S. sonnei among traditionally observant Jewish children in New York City in 2000. 38 Multiple illnesses in a single household were determined to result from intrahousehold secondary transmission. A multicommunity outbreak of more than 1600 culture-confirmed cases in the greater metropolitan area of Cincinnati, Ohio in 2001 had an overall mean attack rate of 10% among childcare center enrollees. The highest attack rates occurred among newly or incompletely toilet-trained enrollees, and the lowest attack rates were noted among diapered children. The attack rate was 6% among staff members. Secondary transmission was facilitated by poor hygiene practices, including inaccessible handwashing supplies and incomplete diaper disposal practices, as well as through recreational activities involving water. 18 A prolonged multistate increase of shigellosis caused by organisms with similar biochemical and genetic profiles occurred in the South and mid-Atlantic areas in 2001 to 2003. A substantial proportion of infections was associated with group childcare. 39 In 2005, 639 cases of multidrug-resistant S. sonnei were reported in northwest Missouri. A case-control investigation of 39 licensed childcare centers demonstrated that centers with \u22651 sink or a diapering station in each room were less likely to have cases, thus reinforcing the importance of environmental design and hygiene in reducing the propagation of shigellosis in childcare centers. 40 An observational study following a shigellosis outbreak in St. Louis, Missouri examined the utility of requiring a second negative convalescent stool culture among those excluded from work or childcare. Of the 172 people who submitted at least 2 follow-up cultures, the probability that S. sonnei was isolated from a second culture after being isolated from a first culture was 7%. All (100%) of the second cultures from people who had a first negative follow-up culture result were without growth of S. sonnei, a finding suggesting that a single negative convalescent culture result is sufficient to document clearance. 41",

One or more viruses were detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) from two thirds of the children with respiratory tract infections. 45 Molecular-based diagnostics have increased the yield of virus detection in children with respiratory tract infections. An epidemiologic study of childcare attendees with new-onset respiratory illness detected at least 1 virus in 84% and multiple viruses in 46% of cases using PCR. Children with multiple viruses detected at the onset of illness were less likely to have fever (odds ratio [OR] 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-0.9) but more likely to have symptoms lasting >7 days (OR 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.14). 46 A national registry-based study of Danish children from birth to 5 years of age revealed that the first 6 months of enrollment in group childcare among children enrolled at <1 year of age were associated with a 69% higher incidence of hospitalizations for acute respiratory tract infections compared with age-matched children in home care. The incidence of hospitalization decreased after 6 months of group childcare enrollment and was comparable to that of children in home care after >12 months of enrollment. 47 A prospective study comparing children enrolled in childcare in the first year of life with those who were not found that childcare attendees had more episodes of physician-diagnosed upper respiratory tract infections and acute otitis media in their first year disease in a childcare center in Sweden, 17 children had radiographic evidence of pulmonary disease; 1 child had miliary disease, and 17 had latent TB infection. 76 These outbreaks demonstrate that detection and contact investigations in childcare centers are paramount in reducing TB infection.",

Extrapolating to school-aged children, 58% of families of 402 students in Perth, Australia who were affected by pandemic-related school closures reported a substantial disruption of daily schedules. Almost one half of the parents had work absences, and 35% made alternative childcare arrangements. Children affected by the school closures were more likely to report out-of-home activities during the school closure period. Fewer than one half (47%) of the parent respondents believed that the school closures were an effective response in reducing the potential for community transmission. 63 Respiratory Syncytial Virus. RSV is among the most common causes of serious lower respiratory tract infections in young children, with an estimated 55,000 to 125,000 related hospitalizations and 200 to 500 RSVrelated deaths annually in the US. 64 Attack rates as high as 98% have been reported after first exposure among children at risk for infection, with frequent reinfection (65% to 75%) on reexposure to RSV in the 2 years after initial exposure. 65 A prospective cohort study of children 4 weeks to 30 months of age who were attending full-time childcare detected RSV by RT-PCR from 59 (11%) of the children with respiratory illnesses and multiple viruses in 42 (71%) of the patients with RSV. This study also found longer duration of symptoms and increased frequency of healthcare visits in RSV-positive children compared with RSV-negative children. Additionally, 2 clusters of RSV infection resulted in 50% of enrolled children infected within 6 days of the index case in each room. When molecular sequencing was performed in 1 cluster, the same strain of RSV was isolated in 5 (38%) of 13 illness episodes, a finding suggesting rapid child-to-child transmission. 66 Incompletely immunized infants often experience severe clinical disease from pertussis. In many group childcare settings, adolescents and adults with mild to moderate illnesses can be the source cases of pertussis. An outbreak of pertussis occurring in a childcare center in northern Israel with 88% immunization coverage resulted in B. pertussis detected by a positive culture or PCR result in all unvaccinated children and in 7% of vaccinated children. 71 In 2005, the CDC recommended that postpartum women and other contacts of newborn infants receive tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) vaccine to protect infants from pertussis exposure, a strategy known as cocooning. 72 In 2011, the CDC recommended that unvaccinated pregnant women receive a dose of Tdap to protect infants by transplacental maternal antibody transfer. 73 In 2012, the CDC expanded this recommendation to administration of Tdap immunization during the third trimester of every pregnancy. 74 Childcare providers of any age with routine contact with infants <12 months of age should receive a single dose of Tdap. 72 Tuberculosis. An adult or adolescent often is the index case for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections in a group childcare setting; childto-child transmission occurs infrequently. An outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) associated with a private-home childcare facility in San Francisco, California occurred between 2002 and 2004. Of 11 outbreak cases, 9 (82%) occurred in children <7 years of age; all these children had extensive contact through childcare in a private home, where the adult index patient spent considerable time. Isolates from 4 of the pediatric patients and 2 of the adult patients had identical molecular patterns. Additionally, 36 children and adult contacts had latent TB infection. 75 In an outbreak of TB following prolonged contact with a provider with cavitary PART I Understanding, Controlling, and Preventing Infectious Diseases blood exposure, by sexual exposure, and perinatally. However, high levels of HBV DNA have been detected in the saliva of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive children, a finding suggesting that exposure to saliva could be a means of horizontal transmission. 112 Thus, if a known hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier bites and breaks the skin of a hepatitis B-unimmunized child, hepatitis B immune globulin and the HBV vaccine series should be administered to the hepatitis B-unimmunized child. 113 The transmission risk of HCV infection in childcare settings is unknown. The general risk of HCV infection from percutaneous exposure to infected blood is estimated to be 10 times greater than that of HIV but less than that of HBV. Rates for percutaneous exposure to HCV-containing saliva are unknown.",

Universal VZV immunization has reduced cases of clinical disease among children in group childcare. 115 However, several outbreaks of chickenpox have been reported among childcare attendees in the postvaccine era, often in the setting of inadequate vaccination coverage. 115, [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] Herpes Simplex Virus.

            "text": "Echovirus. During an outbreak of echovirus 30 infection in children and care providers in a childcare center, and in exposed parents, infection occurred in 75% of children and 60% of adults; aseptic meningitis was more frequent in infected adults (12 in 65; 18%) than in children (2 in 79; 3%). 96 A retrospective cohort study of echovirus infections in 4 childcare centers in Germany revealed that 42% of childcare attendees, 13% of their household contacts, 5% of childcare center employees, and 2% of employees' household contacts were ill over a 31-day period. Thirteen percent (12 of 92) of childcare attendees had meningitis. This outbreak likely began among children enrolled in group childcare, with secondary cases occurring among their household contacts. 97 An association with childcare also was noted in an outbreak of echovirus 18 meningitis that occurred in a rural Missouri community with an attack rate of 1 per 1000 people; contact with childcare was noted as the most common risk factor among ill people. 98 Parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19, the agent of erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), can cause arthropathy, transient aplastic crisis, persistent anemia in immunocompromised hosts, and nonimmune fetal hydrops. It spreads through contact with respiratory or oropharyngeal secretions. Serologic evidence of past infection has been reported to be 30% to 60% in adults, 15% to 60% in school-aged children, and 2% to 15% in preschool-aged children. 99 The virus is endemic among young children and has caused outbreaks of disease in the childcare setting. 100, 101 In an outbreak during which more than 571 school and childcare personnel were tested serologically, the highest attack rate (31%) occurred among childcare personnel. 100 A cross-sectional study of 477 childcare staff members revealed a seroprevalence of parvovirus B19 immunoglobulin G antibodies of 70%. Seropositivity was associated with age and, among staff members <40 years of age, with length of group childcare contact. 102 A concern exists that a previously nonimmune pregnant childcare provider could be exposed and infected during her childcare responsibilities, thus resulting in transplacental transmission leading to fetal hydrops. Estimates of the risk of fetal loss when a pregnant woman of unknown antibody status is exposed are 3% for fetal death after household exposure and 2% after occupational exposure in a school. 103 The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend exclusion of pregnant women from the workplace when erythema infectiosum is occurring. This recommendation is based on low rates of adverse effects on the fetus and high community prevalence of parvovirus B19 infection. Routine infection control practices, including hand hygiene and proper disposal of used facial tissues, are recommended to prevent transmission. 104 Cytomegalovirus. Young childcare attendees shed cytomegalovirus (CMV) intermittently in their saliva and urine after acquisition, and they often transmit virus to other children and adults with whom they have close daily interaction. Transmission is thought to occur through direct person-to-person contact and from contaminated toys, hands of childcare providers, or classroom surfaces. Prevalence studies have shown that 10% to 70% of children <3 years of age (peak, 13 through 24 months) in childcare are shedding CMV in their urine or saliva. [105] [106] [107] Nonimmune childcare providers and mothers acquire CMV at annual rates of 8% to 20% while caring for CMV-infected children. In comparison, acquisition rates of 1% to 3% were noted among nonimmune childcare providers and mothers caring for CMV-uninfected children. [108] [109] [110] Given that care providers of young children are at increased risk of acquiring CMV, women of childbearing age should be educated about the risks of acquiring CMV, potential effects on the fetus, and methods to prevent transmission including hand hygiene after changing diapers or contact with saliva. 111",

Universal immunization of infants with HBV vaccine in 1991 has reduced to negligible the potential for horizontal HBV transmission in the childcare setting. Because the highest concentrations of HBV in infected people are found in blood and blood-containing body fluids, the most common and efficient routes of transmission are through percutaneous years of age. The increased prevalence of infections in this age group likely reflects compromised hand hygiene resulting in transmission of pathogens from animal to child. Animal interaction can occur in locations where childcare is provided, with a resident pet or visiting animal, or in public venues where children visit, including petting zoos, aquariums, county fairs, parks, carnivals, circuses, or farms. Guidelines to reduce opportunities for transmission and infection have been developed to prevent disease transmission in many of these settings. 135, 136 Inadequate hand hygiene, suboptimal supervision of children's activities following animal contact, and hand-to-mouth activities following animal contact are risk factors for infection. Organisms that have been associated with close contact with animals include E. coli O157:H7, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, Cryptosporidium parvum, C. jejuni, and G. intestinalis. In addition to enteric infections, animal exposure can result in transmission of ectoparasites and endoparasites, M. tuberculosis in certain settings, and local or systemic infections as a consequence of bites, scratches, stings, and other injuries.",

A prospective evaluation of 208 families with at least 1 childcare enrollee that was conducted from November Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and its predisposition for people in crowded conditions where sharing of fomites and skin-to-skin contact occurs make childcare exposure a potential risk factor. A molecular epidemiologic study of MRSA prevalence among 104 children, 32 employees, and 17 household contacts of attendees affiliated with a university medical center's childcare facility in Texas noted an overall 7% colonization rate with MRSA. Molecular typing revealed closely related, mostly community-associated isolates from 1 employee (3%), 6 (35%) family members, and 4 (2%) environmental samples. Macrolide antibiotics and asthma medications were associated with MRSA colonization. 125 An epidemiologic study of 1163 children attending 24 childcare centers in North Carolina and Virginia found that 18% were colonized with S. aureus and 1% with MRSA; genotyping did not indicate classroom transmission in the 2 centers that had multiple children who were colonized with the bacterium. 126 A draining wound is a reason for exclusion of a child from a childcare setting; MRSA colonization is not.",
