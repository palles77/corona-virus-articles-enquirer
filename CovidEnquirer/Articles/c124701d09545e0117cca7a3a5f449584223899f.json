ORFeome collections, whereby almost all ORFs of a given species are cloned and can be subsequently leveraged in multiple functional genomic approaches, represent valuable resources towards this endeavor. Here we provide novel, genome-scale tools for the study of Candida albicans, a commensal yeast that is also responsible for frequent superficial and disseminated infections in humans. We have generated an ORFeome collection composed of 5,102 ORFs cloned in a Gateway\u2122 donor vector, representing 83% of the currently annotated coding sequences of C. albicans. Sequencing data of the cloned ORFs are available in the CandidaOrfDB database at http://candidaorfeome.eu. We also engineered 49 expression vectors with a choice of promoters, tags, and selection markers and demonstrated their applicability to the study of target ORFs transferred from the C. albicans ORFeome. In addition, the use of the ORFeome in the detection of protein-protein interaction was demonstrated. Mating-compatible strains as well as Gateway\u2122-compatible two-hybrid vectors were engineered, validated and used in a proof of concept experiment. These unique and valuable resources should greatly facilitate future functional studies in C. albicans and the elucidation of mechanisms that underlie its pathogenicity. author/funder.

Briefly, ORFs, ranging from 90 bp to 5,295 bp, were amplified from genomic DNA of C. albicans strain SC5314 in 96-well plates using the Thermo Scientific Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase and 30 cycles of amplification, with elongation time varying from 1 to 3 min according to the ORF size. After ethanol precipitation, Gateway\u2122-compatible amplified ORFs were recombined into pDONR207 (Invitrogen) using the Gateway\u2122 BP Clonase\u2122 II Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). Reaction mixes containing pDONR207, the PCR products and the BP Clonase\u2122 were incubated overnight in 96-well plates, at room temperature. After adding proteinase K (Invitrogen) and incubating 10 min at 37\u00b0C, the BP reactions were directly used for bacterial transformation. 45-50 \u00b5l of chemically competent E. coli DH5\u03b1 were added to the BP reactions and incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. After heat-shock at 42\u00b0C for 35 s, 150 \u00b5l of SOC medium (20 ml YPD + 2 ml LB + 1 ml Hepes) was added to the transformation reactions and the samples were covered with breathing films and incubated for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C with shaking. Then 100 \u00b5l of each sample were plated onto LB agar containing 10 \u00b5g/ml Gentamicin and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. The remainder of the transformation reactions were stored at -80\u00b0C in 30% glycerol. A single colony from each transformation reaction was inoculated in 400 \u00b5l 2YT + 10 \u00b5g/ml Gentamicin in 96 deep-well microplates. After 36hgrowth at 37\u00b0C, the cultures were used for plasmid extraction and for -80\u00b0C storage.",

The 3'-ends were also sequenced with the 207VER-R oligonucleotide to ensure that the oligonucleotides did not carry deletions. All inserts validated by Sanger sequencing were systematically subjected to full-length sequence analysis using Illumina technology as described in Chauvel et al. (11) . If nonsense or frameshift mutations were observed in a cloned ORF, another colony was checked, or the ORF reamplified and cloned again. If these attempts were unsuccessful, cloning of the ORF was abandoned. Clones containing contiguous deletions or insertions of multiples of 3 bp were accepted. Missense mutations and those located within introns were accepted. It should be noted that further analysis of each mutation-containing ORF is required to determine whether or not mutations affect the function of the ORF.",

CIp-GTW was obtained after deleting P TET from CIp-P TET -GTW with Acc65I and HpaI. For cloning of the 3xHA coding sequence, two oligonucleotides (oligo1_PciHABsrG and oligo2_PciHABsrG) containing three HA epitopes were hybridized, gel purified, and cloned into pUC-attR1-CmR cut with PciI and BsrGI. The resulting plasmid was then used as a PCR template with primers GTW02 and GTW03. The resulting PCR product was cut with BspEI and HpaI, and cloned into the same sites of pCA-Dest1100 to yield pCA-Dest1110. For cloning of the GFP tag, the GFP gene was amplified from pFA-GFP-URA3 (35) with primers GTW04 and GTW05. The PCR product was cut with PciI and EcoRV and ligated into the same sites of pUC-attR1-CmR. The resulting plasmid was then used as a PCR template with primers GTW07 and GTW03. The resulting PCR product was cut with ScaI and BspEI and ligated into pCA-Dest1100 cut with HpaI and BspEI, yielding pCA-Dest1120. For cloning of the TAP-tag, the TAP-tag coding region was PCR amplified from pFA-TAP-URA3 (11) with primers GTW13 and GTW14. The resulting PCR product was then cut with PciI and BsrGI, and ligated into the same sites of pUC-attR1-CmR. The resulting plasmid was then digested with EcoRV and BspEI and the smallest restriction fragment was ligated into pCA-Dest1100 cut with HpaI and BspEI to yield pCA-Dest1130. For the cloning of C-terminal tags, we generated pUC-attR2 by inserting a SalI-HindIII fragment from pCA-Dest1100 into the same sites of pUC18. For cloning of the 3xHA epitope, pCaMPY-3xHA (36) was used as a PCR template with primers GTW20 and GTW21, and the resulting PCR product cut with BsrGI and NsiI was ligated in the same sites of pUC-attR2.

Our primary collection of 15 C. albicans destination vectors derived from CIp10S (11) provides a choice of two promoters, either the constitutive promoter P TDH3 or the inducible promoter P TET , and the option for N-or C-terminal fusion to various epitope tags (3xHA or TAP) (Table 2 and Fig. 3) . Integration of the destination vectors and their derivatives at the RPS1 locus in the C. albicans genome is promoted by StuI or I-SceI linearization. These CIp10derived vectors carry either the auxotrophic marker URA3 or the NAT1 marker that confers resistance to nourseothricin and can be used with clinical isolates. However, P TET -bearing plasmids cannot carry the NAT1 marker since the transactivator needed for tetracyclinemediated induction of P TET is borne on the NAT1-carrying pNIMX plasmid (11) . All vectors harbor a so-called spacer sequence (SP) originating from the E. coli kanamycin resistance gene, for barcode insertion and subsequent Illumina-based barcode sequencing. A second set of 34 plasmids was also generated with the constitutive promoters P ACT1 or the inducible promoter P PCK1 , and the option for N-or C-terminal fusion to GFP ( Table 2 ). All 49 destination vectors were designated with a standardized nomenclature, pCA-DESTijkl, whereby i stands for the transformation marker (1, URA3; 2, NAT1); j stands for the promoter (1, P TET ; 2, P PCK1 ; 3, P TDH3 ; 4, P ACT1 ); k stands for N-terminal tagging (0, no tag; 1, 3xHA; 2, GFP; 3, TAP); and l stands for C-terminal tagging (0, no tag; 1, 3xHA; 2, GFP; 3, TAP) ( Table 2 and Fig. 3) .

The MAP kinase kinase Hst7 was used as bait and linked to the DNA binding domain lexA, as part of the pC2HB-GC vector. Similarly, the Cek1 kinase was expressed as a prey protein, fused to the activation domain VP16, component of the pC2HP-GC vector. pC2HB-Hst7 and pC2HP-Cek1 were transformed into opaque SC2H3\u03b1 and SC2H3a strains, respectively. Mating of the resulting transformants was achieved through selection for leucine and arginine prototrophy. Upon interaction of the two proteins, the reconstituted transcriptional module promoted the expression of the HIS4 marker, allowing only the mating-derived strains to grow on a histidine-free medium, whereas the original diploid strains could not (Fig. 6B) . Through a mechanism of chromosome loss, the crossed tetraploid strains return back to a diploid state. We showed that the plasmids were stably expressed in the diploid offspring strains as these strains conserved their ability to grow in absence of arginine and leucine, indicating the presence of the prey and bait vectors respectively. In addition, all these strains were able to grow in absence of histidine, indicative of the targeted protein-protein interaction. author/funder. All rights reserved.

CandidaOrfDB already provides information on the available overexpression plasmids and strains. In this study, we have paved the way for a second application of the C. albicans ORFeome through the development of tools for a 2H matrix approach of protein-protein interaction detection via mating in C. albicans. Our data show that mating of diploid C. albicans expressing a bait fused to the LexA DNA binding domain and a prey fused to the VP16 activation domain, respectively, allows protein-protein interactions to be tested. In S. cerevisiae, large-scale 2H screens can be performed in a matrix design whereby haploid strains expressing baits and preys are mated and protein-protein interactions are scored in the resulting diploids. Our toolkit now enables the implementation of such a matrix design for large-scale 2H screens in C. albicans. To this aim, a collection of 1500 prey clones has already been generated. As mentioned above, C. albicans codon usage is unusual, which limits the development of applications of the C. albicans ORFeome in species that use standard decoding such as S.",
