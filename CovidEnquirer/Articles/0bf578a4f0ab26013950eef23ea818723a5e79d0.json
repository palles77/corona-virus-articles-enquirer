For an evaluation of gaseous disinfection efficacy, a down-scaled laboratory model was established, using currently available carrier tests and a custom-made dry fog box. A mixture of peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (PAA/HP) was investigated as example, at concentrations between 0.4 and 2.9 mL/m 3 for up to 3 h for inactivation of a panel of lipid-enveloped and non-lipidenveloped viruses. The influenza viruses were most sensitive to PAA/HP treatment and minute virus of mice was most resistant. Bovine viral diarrhea virus and reovirus III showed intermediate stability and similar inactivation kinetics. Use of the dry fog box circumvents dedicating an entire lab for the investigation, which renders the generation of data more cost-effective and allows for production of highly reproducible kinetic data.",

            "text": "Gaseous disinfection is a procedure commonly used to inactivate microbes in biotechnological manufacturing facilities and laboratories. The disinfectants should be effective against all relevant microbial agents; however, information supplied by disinfectant manufacturers does not necessarily cover targeted microbes. This lack of information about relevant targets has prompted a variety of past investigations on disinfectant effectiveness, which were typically performed directly in the laboratory environment [1e5] . The resulting data was rather limited, as the experimental setup did not allow to obtain sequential samples at different times during the inactivation run (kinetic samples) for an assessment of virus inactivation, as requested by regulatory guidance [6, 7] . Additionally, a complete laboratory shutdown was required, which is costly and time consuming. These constraints were circumvented by performing small-scale evaluations using biosafety class III cabinets that were connected to vapor generators [8, 9] . Biosafety class III cabinets however, are only rarely available. As an alternative and more practical approach we established a robust, simple and cost-effective down-scaled investigation procedure, which simulates the practical conditions around biotechnology applications, i.e. in manufacturing facilities as well as laboratory units that allows for kinetic investigation of gaseous disinfectant procedures. Using a custom made Dry Fog box and currently available carrier tests [10] , the virus inactivation capacity of the Minncare \u00ae Dry Fog decontamination system that uses a mixture of peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (PAA/HP) was investigated with a panel of viruses, including the lipid-enveloped viruses bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and influenza A and B viruses, as well as the non-lipidenveloped respiratory enteric orphan virus type III (Reo III) and the parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM). Infectious virus titers were determined by median tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID 50 ), using eightfold replicates of serial half-log sample dilutions of virus-containing samples that were titrated on the cell lines indicated above. The cells were incubated at 36 C, before the cytopathic effect was evaluated by visual inspection under an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TS100). TCID 50 titers were calculated according to the Poisson distribution and expressed as log 10 [TCID 50 /mL]. Virus reduction factors were calculated in accordance to the EU Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products guidance [7] , from at least two independent runs.",

The box has a lateral manipulation opening and three rubber-sealed slots at the bottom front side including three movable carrier slides with twelve sample holders each. Two ventilators inside the box ensure the homogenous distribution of the disinfectant which was confirmed by measurements of relative humidity (rH) that did not vary by more than 3% between the different recorders. Temperature and relative humidity was recorded by four TS Pro2 X logger units and a Tracksense Pro Sky Access Point module. Data monitoring was done with the validated software ValSuitePro (Ellab A/S; Hilleroed, Denmark).",

A Minntech \u00ae Dry Fog unit (Cantel Medical Corp./Mar Cor, Little Falls, NJ), was connected to the diffusion head via a magnetic valve for regulation of 10% aqueous Minncare \u00ae Cold Sterilant, containing peroxyacetic acid (PAA, 4.5%) and hydrogen peroxide (HP, 22.0%), that was released into the box. PAA/HP solution was applied in four different run designs (IeIV), at increasing concentrations ranging from 0.4 mL/m 3 (run design I) to 2.9 mL/m 3 (run design IV). PAA/HP solution concentrations were calculated according to the Excel spreadsheet \"Minncare DRY FOG Calculations\" provided by Minncare \u00ae . During the first 59 min of run design II (0.8 mL PAA/HP solution/m 3 ) re-fogging was performed as soon as the rH decreased by 5%. Kinetic samples were drawn after 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 59 min by pulling the sample holder out of the Dry (1), the TS Pro2 X Logger eUnits (2), the Dry Fog generating unit with its 3 manometers (3), the diffusion head of the Dry Fog unit (4), and the slipcase with sample holders (5).

In contrast, BVDV was inactivated at the same disinfectant concentration after 59 min treatment by merely 1.6 log 10 (Table 1A , Fig. 2A ). Doubling the amount of PAA/HP solution (0.8 mL/m 3 , run design II) resulted in inactivation of BVDV by 2.6 log 10 after the total inactivation time of 59 min (Table 1A , Fig. 2A ). Similar inactivation kinetics were found for Reo III, of which 1.9 log 10 virus infectivity were inactivated after 59 min treatment with run design I and 1.6 log 10 at the higher disinfectant concentration (run design II; Table 1B , Fig. 2B ). After the complete inactivation period of 174 min Reo III was inactivated by 2.3 log 10 in run design I and 2.1 log 10 in run design II, respectively (Table 1B, Fig. 2B) . MVM was only inactivated by 1.1 log 10 at the low PAA/ HP solution amount in run design I after 174 min (Table 1B , Fig. 2C ). Application of a PAA/HP solution amount of 0.8 mL/m 3 including repeated re-fogging to maintain a nearly constant PAA/ HP concentration during the first 59 min treatment showed inactivation of 1.6 log 10 MVM (Fig. 2C ).

Data on virus inactivation provided by the manufacturer show effective inactivation of poliovirus, human coronavirus and human immunodeficiency virus by use of suspension tests only [17] , which are however not meaningful regarding the application of dry fog, underlining the requirement for the conduct of relevant disinfectant efficacy studies. We found that already lower PAA/HP concentrations (run design I) were sufficient for inactivation of influenza viruses, but MVM could be only partially inactivated during run design III; inactivation to below the detection limit (i.e. > 4.6 log 10 ) required a 174 min treatment and elevated PAA/HP solution concentration (run design IV: 2.9 mL/m 3 ). If MVM was the target virus, i.e. after contamination of a biotechnology facility with specifically this virus [12] , an extended disinfection period would have to be considered. An earlier investigation had shown inactivation of Reo III and MVM to below the detection limit after 60 min exposure time, applying only 2 mL/m 3 PAA/HP solution of roughly a 25% higher concentration [1] . These data are generally comparable to our findings, however a clear comparison is not possible as drawing of kinetic samples was not feasible within the limitations of the whole laboratory fogging set-up chosen, and consequently safety margins of the inactivation approach could not be assessed.",
