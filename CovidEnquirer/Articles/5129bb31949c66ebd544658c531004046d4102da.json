Considering the relative shortage of SARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid detection kits and false-negative results caused by various reasons, such as the quality of the samples taken, the number of viruses and the stage of the disease, medical experts have proposed screening of highly suspected patients with lung CT. However, due to mild COVID-19 patients are defined as no pneumonia on imaging, and imaging findings of some patients are atypical, screening based on CT findings is greatly dependent on the physician's experience and the effectiveness is limited.

Since this diagnostic model was a logistic regression equation and inconvenient to operate in clinical environment, we converted the diagnostic model into an scoring tool by assigning values to each variable in the equation. Besides of that, we enrolled two more parameters into the final COVID-19 EWS, including age and meaningful respiratory symptoms. Based on the statistical analysis, we found that elderly people were more susceptible to COVID-19 and develop severe, which may due to their lower disease resistance and more basic diseases; some significant symptoms, such as cough, expectoration and dyspnea, can help to strengthen the association between fever and lower respiratory symptoms and weaken the weight of fever caused by other reasons. As a result, the COVID-19 EWS contained easy-to-get parameters on clinical manifestation, epidemiological characteristics, basic vital signs, laboratory and radiologic data, which provide a more comprehensive assessment of patients. Through re-evaluation in the validation dataset and comparison with other methods, results showed that both of our diagnostic model and COVID-19 EWS had relatively high and stable sensitivity and specificity.",

In order to determine whether the diagnostic model and COVID-19 EWS are advantageous, we compared their diagnostic capacity to SARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid detection and CT scan (Figure 2B-F). We used the first SARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid detection result to value its sensitivity and specificity. Results showed that although nucleicacid detection had a high specificity, its sensitivity was lower than COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.918 vs 0.932; validate dataset 0.889 vs 0.944). Screening only by CT scan had a high sensitivity, but low specificity (training dataset 0.737 vs 0.874; validate dataset 0.737 vs 0.842).
