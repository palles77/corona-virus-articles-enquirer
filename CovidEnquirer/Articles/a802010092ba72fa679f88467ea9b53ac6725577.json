Despite that, the frequency of visits per patient has increased from 1.98 to 2.14, and the hospital admission rate increased from 87.43 to 94.51 (possibly due to the ageing of the population). We still observed a 21% reduction in the number of hospitalized days per person, which contributes to the reduction of the mean duration of stay from 6.83 to 4.58 days.

A better management of the duration of stay in the hospital is an important element for controlling healthcare expenditures. Possible adverse patient satisfaction, arising from shorter stays, has not been included in the assessment; however, studies in the Netherlands suggest higher patient satisfaction scores for some specific items in hospital wards with shorter lengths of stay. [12] Additionally, the workload for the medical and health staff due to the shorter stays has not been properly measured and reflected in cost considerations. For example, arranging for surgery in the day, rather than admitting the patient overnight, implies that medical and health workers have less time to do the preparation and provide the necessary services for operation. These are important elements and are consistently neglected in assessing the \"cost-effectiveness\" of shorter stays in the hospital. 12 There are some limitations in applying the decomposition method as described in this study.",

Second, we assume the workload on the medical and health workers per hospitalized day for any patient is the same, which is unlikely to be true. It is has been reported that the implementation of day surgery arrangements-as opposed to admitting the patient a day earlier-has indeed caused excessive workload for medical and healthcare workers. A simple count of the number of hospitalized days might not properly reflect the additional work arising from the reduction of the mean duration of hospital stays. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 ",

Despite that, the frequency of visits per patient has increased from 1.98 to 2.14, and the hospital admission rate increased from 87.43 to 94.51 (possibly due to the ageing of the population). We still observed a 21% reduction in the number of hospitalized days per person, which contributes to the reduction of the mean duration of stay from 6.83 to 4.58 days. Hence, even a shorter average stay per hospital visit, which could induce an increase in the number of re-visits, still leads to a reduction in the total number of hospitalization days.",

[6] About 80% of inpatients come from public hospitals under the Hospital Authority. [7] The public healthcare sector currently accounts for over 90% of total secondary and tertiary care, while its subsidy from the Government has reached 95%. The public pays HK$100 (US$13) per day to receive inpatient services, while the average operating cost per hospital bed is about HK$3,300 (US$350) a day. Furthermore, Hong Kong is facing an acute ageing problem with a 14% of older In the present study, we use a decomposition method to examine and quantify the impact of the mean duration of stay on the other two factors: total number of patients per 1,000 people of the general population, and the mean number of visits per year in assessing its impact on the total number of hospitalization days. (Table 1) were collected from the Census and Statistics Department and Hospital Authority, respectively. The Census statistics include both sexes and ages for the whole population. The Hospital Authority provides the episode-based hospitalization data which contain information on age, gender, hospital, date of birth, district of residence, date of admission and discharge, disease code, duration of stay for each visit, and discharge destination. However, there are quite a significant proportion of the patient data with missing disease code and we will not examine the disease-code specific duration of stay in this analysis. Also, Although the capacity of the Hong Kong hospital system varies throughout the years and the overall occupancy rate is about 90% on average.. The hospital service model in Hong Kong remains relatively unchanged during the study period.

Reducing hospital patient days has become one of the major health care policy and practice all over the world. [5, 16] Comparing with 26 OECD countries, the average length of stay for all diagnosis causes in Hong Kong hospitals dropped the most (30.0%) from 2002 to 2010, whereas that in Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States reduced 23.1%, 15.0%, 18.7% and 2.0%, respectively. The actual number of days in Hong Kong (6.3 to 4.4) was longer than that of Mexico (4.2 to 3.9) and United States (4.9 to 4.8) but had a similar range like in Australia (6.5 to 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   13 5.0), Denmark (6.0 to 4.6), and Norway (5.7 to 4.5). However, does the significant drop of duration of stay in hospitals imply an improvement in health care services over time? A good quality of care is as essential as the efficiency of the health care system. Shortening in-hospital length of stay may be consistent with an orderly and systematic care pathway, but a longer length of stay might be regarded as appropriate for extended treatment. \"The problematic nature of relationship between length of stay and quality needs to be acknowledged.\" [17] Our results showed that the mean duration of stay plays a very significant role in determining the number of hospitalization days against an overall hospital occupancy of 90%. Despite that, the frequency of visits per patient has increased from 1.98 to 2.14, and the hospital admission rate However, the workload for the medical and health staff due to the shorter stays has not been properly measured and reflected in cost considerations. A recent survey in Hong Kong public hospitals indicated a very high burn-out rate and increasing workload was one major factor. [22] Certainly, additional investment in human resources and equipment as well as utilization of newer technologies are measures that can counteract the effect of patients volume on health care workers workload. These are important service quality considerations in assessing the \"cost-effectiveness\" of shorter stays in the hospital.",

Reducing hospital patient days has become one of the major health care policy and practice all over the world.

For example, arranging for day surgery, rather than admitting the patient overnight, implies that medical and health workers would have less time to do the preparation and provide the necessary services for operation as reflected by the frontline medical and health personnel to the authors. A recent survey in Hong Kong public hospitals indicated a very high burnt-out rate and increasing workload was one major factor. [22] Certainly, if the hospitals can add additional investment in human resources and, equipment and as well as utilization of newer technologies, those are measures that can counteract the effect of volume of patients volume on health care workers workload. These are important service quality considerations elements and are consistently neglected in in assessing the \"cost-effectiveness\" of shorter stays in the hospital. 16 There are some limitations in applying the decomposition method as described in this study.",

Total hospitalization days are made up of three factors: the number of inpatients per thousand people of the general population, the number of visits per patient, and the duration of the stay in the hospital per visit.

We examine the factors contributing to the reduction: total hospitalization days are made up of three factors: the number of inpatients per thousand people of the general population, the number of visits per patient, and the duration of the stay in the hospital per visit. Apparently, the increase in population size, patient population, and the number of visits per patient in a given year has been offsetting by the improvement in the management of patients, in terms of the reduction of the mean duration of the number of days per visit, resulting in a 30% reduction of the hospitalization days during the study period, 2001-2010.",

According to the latest report by the Hospital Authority, despite an increase in population size from 6.7 to 7.0 million and the number of patients (583,000 to 664,000) from 2000 to 2010, there has been a significant reduction in the total number of hospitalization days.
