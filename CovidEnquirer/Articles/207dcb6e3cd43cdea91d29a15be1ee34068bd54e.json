While reliable estimates of the reproduction number and the death risk associated with COVID-19 are crucially needed to guide public health policy, another key epidemiological parameter that could inform the intensity and range of social distancing strategies to combat COVID-19 is the asymptomatic proportion, which is broadly defined as the proportion of asymptomatic infections among all the infections of the disease. Indeed, the asymptomatic proportion is a useful quantity to gauge the true burden of the disease and better interpret estimates of the transmission potential. This proportion varies widely across infectious diseases, ranging from 8% for measles and 32% for norovirus up to 90-95% for polio [4] [5] [6] . Most importantly, it is well established that asymptomatic individuals are frequently able to transmit the virus to others [7] [8] .",

By February 21, 2020, two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end, a total of 634 people including one quarantine officer, one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for COVID-19 out of the 3,711 passengers and crew members on board the vessel. Laboratory testing by PCR were conducted, prioritizing symptomatic or high-risk groups. Daily time series of laboratory test results for COVID-19 (both positive and negative), including information of presence or absence of symptoms from February 5, 2020 to February 20, 2020 were extracted from secondary sources [12]. The reporting date, number of tests, number of tested positive and number of symptomatic and symptomatic cases at the time of sample collection are provided, while the time of infection and true asymptomatic proportion are not available. A total of 634 people have tested positive among 3063 tests as of February 20, 2020.
