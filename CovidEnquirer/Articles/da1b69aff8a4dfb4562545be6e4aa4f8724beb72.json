People worry about recirculated air, and some wear masks during trips. On several recent flights I have noticed another likely means of viral transmission: careless hygiene practices by flight attendants serving drinks.",

Rims are the business ends of the cups-to which we apply our mouths when drinking. Wiser practice would be to place the cups upside down and keep them in their plastic sleeves on the cart, pull them out handling only the bottom outside surfaces of the cups, and never touch the rims from which we drink. The containers from which the drinks are served should always have openings that don't require handling the area over which the liquid flows when poured (think about how we handle milk-carton-type containers in which some kinds of orange juice are packaged).",

Observe how your waiters handle pitchers and drinking glasses next time you eat in a restaurant. Does your waiter hold the water glass by the rim as he serves it? Does he place the water pitcher on the table and lean against it with his hands on the rim of the pitcher while pleasantly chatting with you? If so, he is putting his customers at risk from germs transmitted from his hands, from other customers, from handled money, or from his own nose and skin.",

The cleaning products industry has developed many new, quick, easy methods for sanitizing. But my observations suggest that common sense and thoughtful application of what we know about disease transmission-not only in the hospital setting but also in our everyday lives-are lacking.",

It is a matter of social responsibility and public health. The costs of the common cold and viral gastroenteritis in the US are each estimated at about $40 billion annually. 1,2 In 10% of acute hepatitis C cases and 30% of chronic hepatitis cases, a source of infection can't be identified. 3 When I was in medical school, we were taught that hepatitis B could be transmitted only parenterally. At that time, Medicare funded maintenance dialysis; nurses and doctors worked without gloves and smoked and ate in the dialysis units-and lots of them developed hepatitis B-without having experienced needle-sticks.",
