            "text": "Airway management is a challenging task where skillful techniques and appropriate devices must be well incorporated. Among all the requirements for a successful endotracheal intubation, conventional laryngoscopy is regarded as the most difficult practice because professional training and skills experience are usually insufficiently provided. Inappropriate training and lack of equipment support not only results in inaccurate esophageal intubation but also leads to unnecessary airway injury. 1 One of the obstacles is that conventional laryngoscopy does not reveal the vocal cords as a result of the discrepant anatomic structure or the lack of skill. 2, 3 To overcome the poor visibility of the vocal cords, transillumination of the neck with illuminating stylets (i.e., lightwand) has been developed with an overall success rate of intubation between 97.9% and 100%. 4, 5 However, the lack of direct visual confirmation of the airway orifice could lead to unnoticed esophageal intubation until hypoxemia has developed. Theoretically, the potential catastrophe associated with \"blind\" intubation can be avoided under video-guided intubation when the assistant and supervisor are simultaneously attentive. 6 Another critical disadvantage of direct laryngoscopy is the hygiene hazard. To obtain a maximal view, the performer (and/or the supervisor) has to place their eyes close to the patient's mouth. As a result, contaminated exhalations from the patient's airway may directly contaminate the performer's face. Thus, endotracheal intubation is known as the most risky procedure for medical staff because the patient's exhalations are capable of transmitting infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and open tuberculosis. To keep medical staff safe from this iatrogenic possibility, the performer has to stay away from the infectious source as far as possible.",

Routine storage of medical images allows offline investigation and subsequent case studies. For difficult airway management, replay of the video images are the most effective teaching material for medical staff to handle similar clinical situations. This is particularly helpful when trainees wish to review their practice and seek professional opinions from different mentors. Recently, numerous image processing and analysis algorithms have been proposed. Accumulated images can help in building a powerful database for large-scale study off-line.",
