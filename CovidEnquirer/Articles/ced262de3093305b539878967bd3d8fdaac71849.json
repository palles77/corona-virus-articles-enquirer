            "text": "Pneumonia, a respiratory infection of the alveolar space, can vary from a mild outpatient illness to a severe illness necessitating hospitalization and intensive care. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the US and the number one cause of death from infectious diseases. When the infection occurs in patients who are living in the community it is termed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), while it is called nosocomial pneumonia if it arises in patients who are already in the hospital. Presently, the distinction between community-acquired and nosocomial infection is less clear because the 'community' includes complex patients such as those who have recently been hospitalized, those in nursing homes, and those with chronic diseases who are commonly managed in such facilities as dialysis centers or nursing homes. When this latter group develops pneumonia, it has been termed healthcare associated pneumonia (HCAP) and this illness shares clinical features with CAP, but the etiologic pathogens may overlap with those seen in more traditional nosocomial pneumonia. Thus, the relationship between bacteriology and the site of origin of infection is a reflection of several factors, including: the types of patients who develop the illness, their host defense related predisposition to infection with specific pathogens, and their environmental exposure to certain organisms. This discussion focuses on pneumonia arising out of the hospital in immune-competent individuals, but excludes discussion of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or traditional immune suppression (cancer chemotherapy, immune suppressive medications).",

Although the majority of cases of CAP are managed in the outpatient setting, the greater part of the cost of treatment is focused on hospitalized patients. Those who are admitted to the hospital commonly tend to be older and have a high frequency of comorbid illness. In the US, the population of elderly patients is increasing, and those aged over 65 make up about one-third of all CAP patients, but this group accounts for more than half of the cost because of the frequent need for elderly CAP patients to be hospitalized.",

These findings add to the emphasis on pneumonia prevention, especially through the use of available vaccines.",

Pneumonia can also occur in patients who have an adequate immune system, if the host defense system is overwhelmed by a large inoculum of microorganisms, which can occur in a patient with massive aspiration of gastric contents.

            "text": "Keeping these concepts in mind, it is easy to understand why previously healthy individuals develop infection with virulent pathogens such as viruses, L. pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae. On the other hand, chronically ill patients can be infected by these organisms, as well as by organisms that commonly colonize patients, but only cause infection when immune responses are inadequate. These organisms include enteric Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp.) and fungi. Recent studies have evaluated the normal lung immune response to infection and have shown that it is generally 'compartmentalized', and thus most patients with unilateral pneumonia have an inflammatory response that is limited to the site of infection, not spilling over to the uninvolved lung or to the systemic circulation. In patients with localized pneumonia, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukins 6 and 8 (IL-6, IL-8) levels were increased in the pneumonic lung and generally not increased in the uninvolved lung or in the serum. In patients with severe pneumonia, the immune response is characterized by a spillover of the immune response into the systemic circulation, reflected by increases in serum levels of TNF and IL-6. It remains uncertain why localization does not occur in all individuals, and why some patients develop diffuse lung injury (acute respiratory distress sydrome, ARDS) or systemic sepsis as a consequence of pneumonia. Recent studies have suggested that genetic polymorphisms may explain some of these differences, with patients who have certain inherited patterns of immune response being more prone than others to severe forms of pneumonia, and even mortality from this illness. For example, certain genetic polymorphisms are associated with a greater risk of death from sepsis but not CAP. Specifically, TNF-308 polymorphisms increase sepsis mortality, but not mortality from CAP. In addition, CAP severity is increased with genetic changes in the IL-10-1082 locus, which are often present along with changes in the TNF-308 locus. Another genetic change associated with an increased risk of septic shock from CAP is a modification in heat shock protein 70-2. Currently, we are aware of the large number of genes that can affect the severity and outcome of CAP, but much more must be learned to put these findings into a true clinical context.",

Patients with severe CAP may have a slightly different spectrum of organisms than less severely affected individuals, being commonly infected with pneumococcus, atypical pathogens, enteric Gram-negatives (including P. aeruginosa), Staphylococcus aureus, and H. influenzae. The modifying factors that increase the risk of infection with DRSP are: age over 65 years, beta-lactam therapy within the past 3 months, alcoholism, immune suppressive illness (including therapy with corticosteroids), multiple medical comorbidities, and exposure to a child in a day care setting. The modifying factors for enteric Gram-negatives include: residence in a nursing home, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, multiple medical comorbidities, and recent antibiotic therapy. The risk factors for P. aeruginosa infection are: structural lung disease (bronchiectasis), corticosteroid therapy (410 mg day \u00c0 1 prednisone), broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for 47 days in the past month, and malnutrition.

More recently, some studies have shown that resistance can affect outcome. In a group of patients with pneumococcal bacteremia, of which more than half were HIV-positive, high-level resistance was a predictor of mortality. Other investigators did not find an increased risk of death from infection with resistant organisms, but did find an enhanced likelihood of suppurative complications (empyema), and a more prolonged length of stay in hospital. These conflicting data may have been the result of studying relatively few patients, many of whom did not have high levels of in vitro resistance. One large study evaluated more than 5000 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia and CAP and found an increased mortality for patients with a penicillin MIC of at least 4 mg l \u00c0 1 or greater, or with a cefotaxime MIC of 2.0 mg l \u00c0 1 or more. However, this increased mortality was only present if patients who died in the first 4 days of therapy were excluded from analysis. Fortunately, very few organisms are currently at this level of resistance, which may explain the conflicting findings in various studies. More recently, another study using both a cohort and matched control methods found that severity of illness, and not resistance or accuracy of therapy, was the most important predictor of mortality. In some studies, severity of illness was greater in patients without resistant organisms, implying a loss of virulence among organisms that become resistant, a finding echoed in other studies that have found that the absence of invasive illness is a risk factor for pneumoccal resistance.",

However, some resistance is higher level and due to an inability of the antibiotic to bind to its ribosomal site of action, and this form of resistance may be much higher level and more likely to be clinically relevant. There are however, very few reports of macrolide failures in CAP, especially considering the widespread use of these agents.

In addition, they can occur as either primary pathogens, or may be part of a mixed infection, along with traditional bacterial pathogens. When mixed infection is present, it may lead to a more complex course and a longer length of stay than if a single pathogen is present. There may be a particular synergy between C. pneumoniae and pneumococcus, with either sequential, or mixed infection with C. pneumoniae leading to a more severe course for pneumococcus. The frequency of atypical pathogens can be as high as 60% of all CAP patients, in some series, with as many as 40% of patients having mixed infection identified.

In one evaluation of residents of longterm care facilities who had severe aspiration pneumonia (defined by the presence of risk factors for oropharyngeal aspiration), requiring ICU admission, bacteriology was determined by protected bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) within 4 h of admission. When a pathogen was identified, the organisms were: enteric Gram-negatives in 49%, anaerobes in 16%, and S. aureus in 12%. Many of the anaerobes were recovered with aerobic Gram-negatives, and their presence did not correlate with oral hygiene, but the presence of Gram-negatives did correlate with functional status, being more common in patients who were totally dependent. Many patients received inadequate therapy for anaerobes, yet most recovered, raising a question about whether infection with these organisms really needs to be treated.

The two best-studied and widely regarded prediction rules for pneumonia severity are the pneumonia severity index (PSI) and the CURB-65 rule, a modification of a prognostic model developed by the British Thoracic Society. The PSI uses a number of demographic and historical findings, physical findings, and laboratory data to assign a score to each patient, and the score is used to categorize patients into one of five classes, each with a different risk of death. This tool has worked very well to define mortality risk, but has had variable success in predicting need for admission, is cumbersome to use, and does not discriminate very well among the most severely ill patients. The CURB-65 rule is simpler, using only five assessments: % confusion, % urea47 mmol l \u00c01 , % respiratory rateX30 min \u00c01 , % blood pressureo90 mmHg systolic or p60 mm diastolic, and age X65 years. Each of the five criteria is scored and as the score rises from 0 to 5, mortality risk rises. In recent studies, both tools have worked equally well to identify patients at low risk of dying, but the CURB-65 has been more discriminating in recognizing patients who need ICU care (score of at least 3) and who have the highest risk of death. A major difference between the two models is that the PSI weights advanced age and chronic illness very heavily, while the CURB-65 model includes age as only one of several risk factors, and comorbid illness is not measured, but instead most of the score is based on acute physiologic abnormalities. None of the prediction models includes social factors in the scoring system, and clearly these issues need to be included in patient assessment, paying attention to whether the patient has a stable home environment for outpatient care, an ability to take oral medications, the absence of acute alcohol or drug intoxication, and stability of other acute and chronic medical problems.",

Although very few patients of this type are admitted to the hospital, macrolide monotherapy has been documented to be effective in this population. The majority of inpatients will have cardiopulmonary disease and/or modifying factors, and they can be treated with either a selected intravenous beta-lactam (Table 3) combined with a macrolide, or they can receive an intravenous antipneumococcal quinolone (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) alone. From the available data, it appears that either regimen is therapeutically equivalent, and although not proven, it may be useful to use these two types of regimens interchangeably, striving for 'antibiotic heterogeneity', selecting an agent in a different class from what the patient received in the past 3-6 months. Although oral quinolones may be as effective as intravenous quinolones for admitted patients Table 3 Principles of antibiotic therapy Administer initial antibiotic therapy within 4 h of arrival to the hospital Treat all patients for pneumococcus and for the possibility of atypical pathogen coinfection: use either a macrolide alone (selected patients with no cardiopulmonary disease or modifying factors) or for those outpatients with cardiopulmonary disease or modifying factors: use monotherapy with a quinolone, a ketolide (if no risk factors for enteric Gram-negatives), or the combination of a selected beta-lactam with a macrolide or ketolide or tetracycline Limit macrolide monotherapy to outpatients or inpatients with no risk factors for DRSP, enteric Gram-negatives, or aspiration Limit ketolide monotherapy to outpatients with risk factors for DRSP, but no risk factors for enteric Gram-negatives Provide initial therapy for hospitalized patients with an intravenous agent, or if oral only, use a quinolone For patients at risk for DRSP, acceptable oral beta-lactams are: cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, high-dose ampicillin (3 g day \u00c0 1 ) or amoxicillin/clavulanate (up to 4 g day \u00c0 1 ) For inpatients at risk for DRSP, the selected acceptable intravenous beta-lactams include: ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ertapenem, ampicillin/sulbactam Limit antipseudomonal therapy to patients with risk factors: Antipseudomonal agents include: beta-lactams such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam; quinolones such as ciprofloxacin or high-dose levofloxacin (750 mg day \u00c0 1 ); and aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin, or tobramycin; aztreonam is a monobactam that is also active, but cannot be used alone The new antipneumococcal quinolones, in order of decreasing antipneumococcal activity are: gemifloxacin (oral only), moxifloxacin (oral and intravenous), gatifloxacin (oral and intravenous), levofloxacin (oral and intravenous) Never use monotherapy for patients with severe CAP. If no pseudomonal risk factors use a selected beta-lactam (above) plus a macrolide or antipneumococcal quinolone. For those with pseudomonal risk factors, use an antipseudomonal beta-lactam (above) plus either ciprofloxacin/high-dose levofloxacin or the combination of an aminoglycoside with either a macrolide or antipneumococcal quinolone (above) Vancomyin and linezolid should be used rarely and only in those with severe CAP and either meningitis (vancomycin) or severe necrotizing pneumonia after influenza (either agent) with moderately severe illness, most admitted patients should receive initial therapy intravenously to be sure that the medication has been absorbed. Once the patient shows a good clinical response, oral therapy can be started. Selected inpatients with mild to moderate disease can initially be treated with the combination of an intravenous beta-lactam and an oral macrolide, switching to exclusively oral therapy once the patient shows a good clinical response.",

Quinolones penetrate well into respiratory secretions, and are highly bioavailable, achieving the same serum levels with oral or intravenous therapy, thereby allowing moderately ill outpatients to be managed effectively with oral antibiotics. There are differences among the available agents in their intrinsic activity against pneumococcus, and, based on MIC data, these agents can be ranked from most to least active as: gemifloxacin (available only in oral form), moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin. Some data suggest a lower likelihood of both clinical failures and the induction of pneumoccal resistance to quinolones, if the more active agents are used in place of the less active agents.",

These include the need for timely administration of initial antibiotic therapy, the limited use of therapy directed at methicillin-resistant S. aureus, the need for routine atypical pathogen coverage for all patients, and the emphasis on using highly active agents in all patients with risk factors for infection with DRSP. The reason for this last recommendation is because if a patient is at risk for infection with DRSP, use of a highly active agent is not only likely to minimize the risk of treatment failure, but may also rapidly and reliably eradicate pneumococcal organisms that have low levels of resistance, so that there is less selection pressure for emergence of organisms with high level of resistance.",

Fungi are rarely associated with significant disease in the normal host, although many more cause serious disease in the immunocompromised host. Opportunistic fungal infections have become increasingly common, especially in AIDS patients, and constitute a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this group. Pathogenicity depends on the interplay between components of the host immune system and specific features of the fungal strain. Considerable efforts are underway to conduct genetic characterization of fungal virulence and host susceptibility factors in disease. Genome projects have been undertaken for a number of the key fungal pathogens.

            "text": "Fungi are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that have cell walls and no chlorophyll. They exist in nature as parasites or saprobes, dependent on living or dead organic matter for nutrition. About 250 000 species of fungi have been described, but less than 200 have been associated with human disease. Fungal infection usually originates from an exogenous, environmental source acquired by inhalation, ingestion, or trauma. Very few fungi cause significant disease in the normal host, but many more can cause disease in the immunocompromised host. Thus, pathogenicity can be considered to depend on the interplay between aspects of the host immune system and specific features of the fungal strain. Considerable efforts are underway to conduct genetic characterization of fungal virulence and host susceptibility factors in disease. Genome projects have been undertaken for a number of key pathogens (see 'Relevant websites').Systemic mycoses often start in the lung, but may spread to other organs. They are usually acquired by inhaling spores of organisms growing as saprobes in the soil or decomposing organic material, or as plant pathogens. The organisms that cause systemic fungal infection in humans can be divided into two groups, true pathogens and opportunists. True pathogens, able to invade and grow in tissues of a normal host, include Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidoides immitis, Blastomyces dermatidis and Paracoccidioides braziliensis ( Table 1 ). In general, infections with true pathogenic fungi are asymptomatic or mild, of short duration, occur in regions endemic for the fungus, and follow inhalation of spores from the environment. Individuals either recover from infection with protective immunity to re-infection or sometimes develop chronic granulomatous disease. In the immunocompromised host, however, true pathogenic fungi may cause significant, relapsing, life-threatening disease that is difficult to treat. Opportunist fungi, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, are less virulent and less well-adapted organisms that are only able to invade the tissues of a debilitated or immunocompromised host. Resolution of infection does not confer protection and re-infection or reactivation may occur. Many of these organisms are ubiquitous saprobes found in the soil, decomposing organic ",
