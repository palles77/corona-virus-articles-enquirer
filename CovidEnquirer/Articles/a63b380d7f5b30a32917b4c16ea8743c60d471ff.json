An important means to unraveling the complexities of disaster management is to recognize the interdependencies between health care and broader social systems and how they intersect to promote health and resilience before, during and after a crisis. While recent literature has expanded our understanding of the complexity of disasters at the macro level, few studies have examined empirically how dynamic elements of critical social infrastructure at the micro level influence community capacity. The purpose of this study was to explore empirically the complexity of disasters, to determine levers for action where interventions can be used to facilitate collaborative action and promote health among high risk populations. A second purpose was to build a framework for critical social infrastructure and develop a model to identify potential points of intervention to promote population health and resilience. A community-based participatory research design was used in nine focus group consultations (n \u00bc 143) held in five communities in Canada, between October 2010 and March 2011, using the Structured Interview Matrix facilitation technique. The findings underscore the importance of interconnectedness of hard and soft systems at the micro level, with culture providing the backdrop for the social fabric of each community. Open coding drawing upon the tenets of complexity theory was used to develop four core themes that provide structure for the framework that evolved; they relate to dynamic context, situational awareness and connectedness, flexible planning, and collaboration, which are needed to foster adaptive responses to disasters. Seven action recommendations are presented, to promote community resilience and population health.",

Systems characterized by change, particularly those crossing jurisdictional boundaries, cannot be analyzed without consideration of the dynamic context influencing operations (Ansell et al., 2010; Cilliers, 1998) . The complexity frame of reference recognizes the interactions among system components, and between a given system and the larger environment (Coiera, 2011) , and is now recognized as an essential lens for disaster management and resilience-oriented development (Kahan, Allen, George, & Thompson, 2009) .",

The 2010 earthquake in Haiti exemplifies this. The acute response spanned several months, yet recovery will continue for years, and will continue to require extensive collaboration between Haitian and international agencies to develop the infrastructure to promote population health and resilience in the country. Likewise, following the relatively short response phase for the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), recovery and planning efforts to prepare for the next global outbreak have been ongoing for nearly a decade (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009; Reissman, Watson, Klomp, Tanielian, & Prior, 2006; World Health Organization [WHO] , 2009).",

Discussions of systems of critical infrastructure tend to focus on securing and protecting hard capital resources, such as facilities, supplies (e.g. vaccines), technology, and equipment. Recognition of soft capital (e.g. people and knowledge) has been slower, and there is a need for deeper understanding of the dynamics of critical social infrastructure and how it influences community capacity. Several authors have recognized this gap and suggest more empirical studies focused on social infrastructure such as communication networks, social capital, collaboration and community engagement, and methods for evaluating resilienceoriented intervention activities which focus on soft infrastructure are needed (Chandra et al., 2011; Sherrieb, Norris, & Galea, 2010; Wyche et al., 2011) .",

Second, previous literature has expanded our understanding of the complexity of disasters, but few studies have examined empirically what the necessary ingredients for crisis management are at the grass roots, micro level, and how dynamic elements of critical social infrastructure influence community capacity. This gap in the literature is particularly apparent with respect to protecting and promoting the health of high risk populations, who are people at heightened risk for negative impacts from a crisis, due to the intersection of the social determinants of health (O'Sullivan & Bourgoin, 2010) . These groups are reliant on community supports for activities of daily living, and when these supports are compromised, high risk populations, particularly people with complex medical needs, are at even greater risk for health and social problems, which create additional demands for health and social services.",

However many interventions focus on macro outcomes, without relating to the complexity of inputs at the micro level, and there is a lack of emphasis on upstream initiatives to address the complexity. Mapping of hard and soft system infrastructure, and how they contribute to managing uncertainty in disaster management, is a gap that has not been adequately addressed in the literature. We suggest the development of resilience-oriented interventions requires unpacking of the complexity at the micro level, and that interventions must emerge from the underlying complex structure including dynamic organizations, processes, technology and people; therefore an essential first step is to model the complexity inherent in the social infrastructure of a community.",

Additional recruitment techniques involved snowball sampling as the community members became aware of the sessions and disseminated information through their networks. Broad inclusion criteria ensured representation from different sectors, and fostered inclusion of community groups representing high risk populations. In each community there was representation from municipal or regional emergency management, public health, tri-services (e.g. fire, police, paramedic), emergency service organizations, food banks, and associations which advocate or provide direct care for people with disabilities. Multi-generational representatives from high risk groups participated in the focus groups, including stroke survivors and their family caregivers, several people who are hard-of-hearing or Deaf, people with low (or no) vision, and people who use assistive devices, such as a cane, wheelchair or service animal. The focus groups were conducted in English in three communities and French for the other two. Sign interpreters were provided for participants from the Deaf community and notetakers were provided for people with limited vision or fine motor control, to ensure they could participate. All participants signed a consent form approved by the university ethics review board prior to participating in the focus groups. Ethics approval for the study was obtained on July 23, 2010.",

The participant who is the interviewer writes down the response in the form of field notes, whereas the participant being interviewed voices his/her thoughts about the question without the pressure of speaking in front of the whole group. The process is repeated until each participant has interviewed one person from each of the other tables and also responded to the questions from each table. The facilitator guides the group so participants know how to proceed through the matrix. Following the interview matrix, the participants return to their assigned table for the small group deliberation phase, to review and summarize the data from the interviews. Data during this phase is in the form of conversations as the people at each table discuss the responses they received to their question during the interview phase.

In this study, we repeated the phases twice, to generate data for eight questions which focused on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to disaster preparedness in each community, with emphasis on protection of high risk populations with functional needs related to communication, complex medical needs, supervision, independence and transportation. The questions were informed by the CMIST functional needs framework (Kailes & Enders, 2007) . Sample questions included: \"What are the strengths/assets/resources within your community that contribute to preparedness for, response to, and recovery from a disaster?\" (the same question was asked in relation to weaknesses/vulnerabilities) and \"In a disaster in your community, what supports and challenges would appear for people who have limited ability to communicate (due to disabilities affecting communication, being socially isolated, or communication technology being down)?\"",

While the participants in our study acknowledged the need for leadership and centralized coordination, more prominent themes emphasized collaboration, awareness, and flexible planning, with the understanding that coordination of resources and protocols is a way of building relationships and situational awareness for better understanding of community assets and needs. These themes support suggestions by Kahan et al.

These examples underscore the need to consider how the impact of massive demands on the acute health care system radiate into other parts of the health sector where service delivery is provided, including public health and home care, as well as occupational health and safety, employee assistance programs, and other sectors which ultimately influence population health. There is extensive literature on the need for coordination and collaboration for unified, comprehensive response to disasters, and national frameworks for disaster response acknowledge the need for multisector engagement and action. Population health and resilience requires collaboration between multi-disciplinary sectors, to ensure there is adequate surge capacity, as well as efficient and effective communication, particularly when infrastructure and operating systems are disrupted (Chandra et al., 2011; FEMA, 2008; Okros et al., 2011; WHO, 2009) .",

Coordinated plans provide structure to consider the possible scenarios and response strategies, however flexibility is essential because selforganization, a central tenet of complexity theory, is often what evolves during a disaster when the context changes quickly (Norris et al., 2008) . Action recommendations from our study, supported by the literature, include interventions designed to facilitate openminded, pliable contingency planning, to ensure organizational adaptive capacity (Cilliers & Preiser, 2010; Kahan et al., 2009) . Wyche et al. (2011) emphasized the role of flexible protocols in the provision of support for people evacuated after Hurricane Katrina. The responders were empowered when they were able to appropriately bend protocols to meet the immediate needs of the survivors and adapt to the emergent issues that arose in the shelters. In the context of pandemic, the WHO (2009) recommends contingency planning include designating and training alternate people for critical positions in any organization, to ensure back-up is available to sustain operations. This represents an important action lever for interventions at the micro level to utilize redundancy as a key strategy for surge capacity.",

This finding is consistent with previous studies (Chandra et al., 2011; Norris et al., 2008) emphasizing organizational and individual linkages as key components of community resilience.

This is consistent with the findings from Chandra et al.

Part of the complexity of fostering collaborative activities is the culture clash between different sectors and organizations, which McConnell and Drennan (2006) describe as institutional fragmentation. The expense and logistics of engaging a wide variety of organizations create additional barriers, yet interventions which foster collaborative activities can be useful for sharing information, social learning, and building collaborative relationships (Carroll et al., 2009; Kuziemsky & Varpio, 2010) .",

Second, recruitment for this study was broad, including participants in full time paid positions with extensive expertise in emergency management, as well as volunteers and employees from community organizations with little to no experience with disaster planning. Our study provides an empirical model to map critical social infrastructure within a community and identify levers for action to promote community resilience. It represents an assets-based lens for identifying resources and opportunities to reduce vulnerabilities for high risk populations, but can also be applied to the broader community to promote well-being. Future studies could explore the directional relationships depicted in the model and effectiveness, feasibility and appropriateness of different intervention strategies targeting each of the inputs in the framework of critical social infrastructure presented in this paper. In particular it will be important to determine how to fully engage representatives of high risk populations and non-traditional organizations not typically involved in disaster planning activities.",

By unraveling the complexities of the inputs and outputs influencing adaptive community response, it simplifies the identification of target points for intervention to enhance resilience.
