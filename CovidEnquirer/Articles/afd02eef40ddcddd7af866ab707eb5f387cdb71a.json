This drawback, together with the requirement of (\u00c0)-pseudoephedrine as the chiral auxiliary, promoted us to develop a new route to the lactone 4 by direct alkylation of lactone 6. This lactone could be prepared using L Lvaline as the starting material.",

After L L-valine was treated with benzyl bromide under the assistance of potassium carbonate, the resultant ester was reduced with LAH to provide N,N-dibenzyl valinol 7. Swern oxidation of 7 followed by nucleophilic attack by a lithium reagent derived from propiolic acid ethyl ester provided anti-aminoalcohol 8 in 70% yield, together with syn-aminoalcohol 9 in 13.5% yield. The stereochemistry of 8 was assigned by transformation of it to known lactone 16 as described below. Since the diastereoselectivity (8:9 = 5.2) was not good at the aldol reaction step, we attempted to improve it using suitable additives. It was found low diastereoselectivity was still encountered when TiCl 4 , 5 Al(OPr-i) 3 , 5 or MgCl 2 6 was used. However, the ratio of 8 to 9 jumped to 9:1 when 2 equiv of HMPA 6 was added. Unfortunately, the yield was only 58% in this case. Consequently we still employed the initial condition to get aldol products when the reaction was scaled up.",

Treatment of 12 with acetic acid in toluene delivered the lactone 6 7 in 89% yield. In order to convert the anti-aminoalcohol 8 to 6, its C4 stereochemistry should be reversed. Accordingly, hydrogenolysis of 8 followed by in situ protection produced alcohol 10, which was transformed into its mesylate 11 with mesyl chloride. It was expected to obtain the lactone 6 by simple lactonization of 11 through an intramolecular S N 2 reaction. However, we found that a mixture of 6 and its 5-epimer 13 were isolated under various conditions such as exposure of 11 to NaOH in ethanol or DMF. The ratio of 6 and 13 was about 2:1-1:1, which implied that S N 1 reaction might also take place. Thus, we had to give up this protocol for assembling 6 from the alcohol 10.",
