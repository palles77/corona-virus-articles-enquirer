            "text": "The etiology and antibiotic resistance patterns of respiratory pathogens varies by geographic region and has evolved over time with the development of vaccines. In the majority of cases requiring hospitalization, no pathogen can be identified. 1 In a 2015 US population-based surveillance study of patients admitted with CAP, only 38% of patients had a pathogen identified, and most were viral. 4 A bacterial pathogen could be isolated in only 14% of patients. The most common pathogen was rhinovirus, followed by influenza virus, then Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were the second and third most common bacterial pathogens, respectively. Other bacterial species that commonly cause CAP include Legionella pneumophila, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. 1, 4 Common viral causes include not only human rhinovirus and influenza, but also human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 1 During peak influenza season, influenza may be the most common cause of CAP requiring hospitalization, although it can often be complicated by secondary bacterial infection. Fungal etiologies are generally rare in immunocompetent hosts. Coccidioidomycosis is a relatively common cause of pneumonia and pneumonitis in the Western United States that can mimic bacterial pneumonia. Other geographic endemic mycoses include Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. Opportunistic fungal pneumonias frequently seen in patients with AIDS and solid organ transplant include Pneumocystic jiroveci pneumonia, Aspergillus, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans ( Table 1) .",

            "text": "The categorization of pneumonia is evolving. Until recently, pneumonia was divided into 4 categories: CAP, health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP), hospitalacquired pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are outside the scope of this article. HCAP is a category that includes patients who have been in regular contact with the health care system, including nursing home residents, patients undergoing home infusion therapy or wound care, dialysis patients, and patients hospitalized for 2 days or more in the prior 90 days. 5 Such patients are thought to have a higher risk of pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, warranting broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, similar to hospital-acquired pneumonia. Common MDR pathogens include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), and gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae species. This topic is currently in flux because HCAP criteria are neither sensitive nor specific for identifying patients infected with MDR organisms. Treating these patients with the same regimen as for hospital-acquired pneumonia leads to overtreatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. 6 Excess mortality in HCAP may be largely attributable to patient comorbidities rather than drug-resistant pathogens. 6 The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society are removing the HCAP category from their guidelines. 7 Forthcoming guidelines will recommend that the group formally known as HCAP be divided into 2 groups, those appropriate for limited spectrum therapy and those with 2 of 3 risk factors for MDR, who do require broad spectrum therapy. 8 Table 2 lists risk factors for the most important MDR organisms. Although evidence on this topic remains incomplete and exact recommendations are not yet clear, it remains very important to identify ED patients who require broad spectrum empiric antibiotics. Historically, penicillin was sufficient treatment for S pneumoniae, but over the past 3 decades the prevalence of drug resistant pneumococcus has increased. 9 Alteration in the penicillin-binding protein is the main resistance mechanism. In the United States, pneumonia owing to penicillin nonsusceptible strains increased from 18% in 1991 to 35% in 2002. 10 The clinical significance of penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae remains unclear, with mixed data on mortality impact and associated costs and durations of stay. 9, 11 However, adverse outcomes are associated with high-level penicillin resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration of 4) and these infections require treatment with a cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone.",

            "text": "Pneumonia is an alveolar infection that occurs when the innate immune system is unable to clear a pathogen from the lower airway and alveoli. 15 Local inflammatory factors and cytokines cause additional harm to the lung parenchyma and lead to systemic inflammation, which causes secondary symptoms such as fever, chills, and fatigue. 16 At a histologic level, the inflammatory response causes congestion, which progresses to red and gray hepatization, and may resolve with minimal fibrosis. 17 In terms of lung mechanics and physiology, pus in the parenchyma leads to decreased compliance and shunt, which increases the work of breathing and worsens hypoxemia and tachypnea-the most important physical examination signs of severe pneumonia for emergency physicians to focus on at the bedside. 17 CAP affects patients of all ages across the spectrum of health, with certain organisms having a predilection for specific patient subgroups. Any condition that causes decreased mucociliary clearance and cough, like cigarette smoking, puts patients at increased risk, as do conditions that lead to aspiration such as cerebral vascular accidents, esophageal disorders, and neuromuscular disorders. 15 Old age and dehydration affect how pneumonia manifests and can make recognition more difficult. Underlying cardiopulmonary disease or structural lung disease can also delay recognition. 18 EPIDEMIOLOGY Pneumonia carries the highest mortality of any infectious disease. 19 Lower respiratory tract infections are the most common infectious cause of death in the world, with 3.5 million deaths annually worldwide (World Health Organization). In the United States, influenza and pneumonia are listed together as the 9th leading cause of death. 20 The highest rates are among elderly adults aged 65 to 79 years. 4 Outcomes in patients requiring hospitalization for pneumonia are poor: the 30-day mortality is 10% to 12% and the readmission rate is 18%. 1 Interestingly, mortality after a CAP hospitalization remains increased at 1 year and 5 years. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and liver disease have an increased incidence of CAP. 21 Fortunately, the use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may be responsible for up to a 35% decrease in the incidence of pneumonia. 22 ",

A thoughtful history and physical examination with close attention to the actual respiratory rate and core temperature, as well as careful interpretation of chest radiographs, are required. This caution is especially true in the elderly. The clinical diagnosis of CAP is made on the basis of respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum production, dyspnea, chest pain, signs of fever, and hypoxemia, as well as an infiltrate on chest imaging. 24 Additional symptoms may include myalgia, fatigue, abdominal pain, and headache, making CAP difficult to distinguish from viral infection, particularly influenza, based on history alone. 25 Possible chest examination findings include dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and inspiratory crackles. Because patients in the ambulatory setting with symptoms suggestive of a respiratory infection have a prevalence of pneumonia of only about 5%, it is possible to rule out CAP without a chest radiograph. Nonelderly patients without any abnormal vital signs and without a focally abnormal auscultatory examination have a probability of CAP (abnormal chest radiographs) of less than 1%. Ruling out CAP without an radiographs should not be attempted, however, in elderly patients, because many will not mount typical signs and symptoms. As many as 30% of elderly patients with CAP are afebrile in the ED and preexisting oxygenation problems and lung disease can further complicate the picture. 1 Fig. 1 outlines a simplified diagnostic approach for ambulatory patients with cough and a suspicion for CAP. Patients who are not elderly, with normal vital signs and normal auscultatory examination, can generally be given a diagnosis of bronchitis and discharged home without antibiotics.

            "text": "Although etiology cannot be reliably predicted by chest radiograph appearance, the following classic associations between radiographic findings and etiology are described in the literature. S pneumoniae typically appears as alveolar or lobar pneumonia. The lower lobe and multilobar involvement is frequently seen. 26 Bilateral disease and interstitial infiltrates are found in 50% of cases. Mycoplasma typically produces reticulonodular opacities or patchy consolidations. Mycoplasma targets bronchial epithelium and, therefore, can cause bronchial wall thickening (peribronchial cuffing) in central bronchi like respiratory viruses. Similarly, Chlamydia pneumoniae classically shows patchy consolidations or reticular opacities. Viral pneumonitis/pneumonia can be radiographically indistinguishable from bacterial CAP, but ground glass opacities are the most common findings after a normal chest radiographs. Finally, aspiration pneumonia commonly affects the posterior and inferior segments of the lung and may cavitate if subacute or chronic. 27 The interpretation of a chest radiographs, however, is an imperfect practice. Not only do these radiographic patterns poorly predict etiology, but radiologists may miss infiltrates in up to 15% of cases. 29 The timing of CAP presentation may also affect radiographic appearance. The chest radiographs may seems to be normal in the first few hours of S pneumoniae, in patients with HIV with early P jirovecii infection, or in the setting of severe dehydration, as is common in patients from skilled nursing facilities. 25 In such cases, a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia should be considered even if the chest radiograph seems to be normal, and it is reasonable to treat for pneumonia and repeat the radiograph in 1 to 2 days. 24 Computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive than plain radiographs for detecting pneumonia. Although the clinical significance of an infiltrate seen on CT but not on chest radiographs is debated, a recent prospective surveillance study showed that illness severity, pathogens, and clinical outcomes were comparable between patients with CAP with an abnormal chest radiographs and those diagnosed by CT scan without an obvious infiltrate on radiographs. 30 If clinical suspicion for pneumonia remains high despite a negative chest radiograph, advanced imaging should be considered and empiric treatment initiated. CT scans may be better at visualizing certain areas of the lung, such as the upper lobes and lingula, and at elucidating interstitial infiltrates as seen with atypical pathogens. 31 CT scanning is useful to further characterize necrotizing infection, multilobar disease, empyema, and pleural involvement. It can also help to differentiate CAP from tuberculosis or lung cancer, which can be difficult to distinguish on chest radiographs alone.",

Procalcitonin is an acute phase reactant that has a very low circulating level (<0.15 ng/mL) normally, but increases with inflammatory diseases, particularly in response to bacterial toxins. The procalcitonin level may be helpful in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections, although the data are not consistent. 3, 15 Procalcitonin may also serve as a marker of disease severity; if low or decreasing, it may allow for the deescalation or termination of antibiotics in the inpatient setting. In a metaanalysis of 14 randomized trials, the use of procalcitonin was associated with a decrease in the duration of antibiotic therapy from 8 to 4 days, without a change in mortality. 34 Another metaanalysis showed lower mortality among critically ill patients who were allowed to have procalcitoninguided cessation of antibiotics. 35 Other biomarkers currently under investigation to differentiate viral from bacterial illness include C-reactive protein and cortisol. 15 Although biomarkers may have a future role in risk-stratification of CAP in the ED setting, ED studies are limited at this time (Fig. 3) .",

The CURB-65 is not as wellvalidated as the PSI and when the 2 measures are compared, the PSI with its 20 variables boasts a slightly higher discriminatory power for mortality and classifies a slightly higher percentage of patients as low risk, and in that sense has greater usefulness. 24, 41 Other pneumonia clinical decision rules that are less-widely used in the United States include SMART-COP, A-DROP, and CAP-PIRO. The Australian SMART-COP score assigns points for low systolic blood pressure, multilobar infiltrates, low albumin, tachypnea, tachycardia, confusion, hypoxemia, and acidemia. A score of 3 or more points identified 92% of patients who would later receive vasopressor or ventilator support. 42 The A-DROP scoring system, developed by the Japanese Respiratory Society, uses the variables age (males 70, females 75), dehydration (blood urea nitrogen >210 mg/mL), respiratory failure (SaO 2 90%), confusion, and hypotension. 43 Similarities between these clinical decision rules are not surprising. The CURB-65 seems to have emerged as the preferred score in the ED because of its simplicity, although the PSI still has a role because it is better at identifying patients who seem to be \"on the fence\" but can actually be safely discharged.",

In nonsevere cases, the goal is to reliably cover S pneumoniae and atypical bacterial pathogens. The decision to provide broader coverage is based on health care exposure risk factures, a history of structural lung disease, or other specific conditions (eg, known MRSA colonization). 18 For outpatients without coexisting illnesses or recent antibiotic use, the IDSA recommends a macrolide (azithromycin, clarithromycin) or doxycycline. 1, 24 If coexisting illness is present or the patient has recently used antibiotics, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin) is recommended; a beta-lactam (eg, amoxicillin) plus Community-Acquired Pneumonia macrolide may also be used. Risk factors for drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae include comorbidities such as heart disease, liver disease, renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, immunosuppression, or antimicrobial use within the previous 3 months (see Table 2 ). For these patients, a respiratory fluoroquinolone should be prescribed or a beta-lactam plus a macrolide. 24 In 1 cohort of patients treated for CAP in the ED, approximately one-half had 1 risk factor for drug-resistant S pneumonia, raising concern for potential overuse of fluoroquinolones. 45 In areas such as Louisiana with a large percentage (48%) of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae (defined as a minimum inhibitory concentration of 16), a respiratory fluoroquinolone or betalactam plus macrolide can be used. 24 See Tables 5 for treatment guidelines. For hospitalized patients, the IDSA guidelines recommends a beta-lactam plus a macrolide (eg, ceftriaxone plus azithromycin). There is increasing evidence that patients do better with a combination of antibiotics rather than fluoroquinolone monotherapy, possibly related to immunomodulation. 3 During high local influenza activity, hospitalized patients generally should also be treated with oseltamivir. Droplet and contact precautions should be used when influenza is suspected.",

Evidence suggests there is no difference in outcomes when treatment duration is 7 days or less compared with 8 days or more. 47 Exceptions include S aureus lobar pneumonia, which may require extended treatment for 2 weeks, and S aureus bacteremia, which generally requires 4 weeks of intravenous treatment. 48 Atypical infections are also an exception; if M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae are known to be the causative organism, 10 to 14 days is recommended. For Legionella, 14 to 21 days of therapy is recommended. 49 For hospitalized patients, an early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics does not compromise outcome and decreases the duration of stay. 3 In addition to antimicrobials and symptomatic care, other CAP treatment adjuncts should be considered, corticosteroids being the most important and widely debated. Steroids may attenuate the inflammatory response, reduce the frequency of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and decrease the length of illness. A systematic review and metaanalysis suggested that steroids reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome by 5% (estimated number needed to treat of 20). 50 Despite this evidence in favor of steroids, there are many high-quality studies showing no benefit. 51 The case for adjunctive steroids is stronger in severe CAP. 50 Steroids should be trialed in patients with vasopressor-dependent shock and selectively in patients with severe CAP and evidence of inadequate cortisol response. 24 Early physical therapy is another important treatment adjunct in hospitalized patients. A single-center retrospective study showed an association between physical therapy for 30 minutes or more and lower 30-day readmission rate. 52",

The concept of HCAP is changing; ED providers need to be aware of risk factors for MDR pneumonia, limiting broad spectrum antibiotics to patients satisfying guideline-recommended criteria. In severe CAP, ED providers should collect blood cultures before administering antibiotics and sputum cultures when applicable, although in most cases etiologic testing does not reveal the causative pathogen. Careful severity assessment is a crucial step in ED CAP management and should include screening for occult sepsis with a serum lactate, followed by early antibiotics and fluid resuscitation when indicated. Risk stratification tools such as the PSI and CURB-65 should be used routinely to determine the most appropriate disposition for a patient. Emergency providers should be familiar with the latest guidelines for antimicrobial treatment for both outpatient and inpatient CAP, which will continue to change as resistance patterns in respiratory pathogens evolve.
