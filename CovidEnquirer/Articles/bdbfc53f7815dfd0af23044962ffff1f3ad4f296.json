We have investigated the kinds of slippery sequence that can function at the IBV frameshift site by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of slippery-sequence mutants. We firstly confirmed that the site of frameshifting in TBV was at the heptanucleotide st'retch UUCAAAC, and then used our knowledge of t,he pseudoknot structure and a suitable reporter gene to prepare an expression construct that allowed both the magnitude and direction of ribosomal frameshifting to be determined for candidate slippery sequences. Our results show that in almost all of the sequences tested, frameshifting is strictly into the -1 reading frame. Monotonous runs of nucleotides, however, gave detectable levels of a -21 + 1 frameshift. product, and U stretches in particular gave significant levels (2% t'o %I?/,). Preliminary evidence suggests that the RN',4 pseudoknot may play a role in influencing frameshift direction. The spectrum of slip-sequences tested in this analysis included all t,hose known or suspected to be utilized in uivo. Our results indicate that triplets of A, C, G and L' are functional when decoded in the ribosomal P-site following slippage (XXXYYYN) although (J triplets were the least effective. In the A-site (XXYmN), triplets of C and G were non-functional. The identity of the nucleotide at position 7 of the slippery sequence (XXXYYYN) was found to be a critical determinant of frameshift efficiency and we show that a hierarchy of frameshifting exists for ,4-site rodons. These observations lead us t'o suggest that ribosomal frameshifting at a particular site is determined, at least' in part. b2 the strength of the interaction of normal cellular tRNAs wit,h the A-site codon and does not necessarily involve specialized \"shifty\" t,RNAs.",

However, in the c+ase of the pseudoknot structure, no primary sequencxe determinant appears to be involved in the frameshift process; as long as the overall structure is maintained, frameshifting is highly efficient (Brie&y rt &., 1991) . The IKV frameshift signal belongs t,o a class of efficient -I frameshift sites first described for the vertebrate ret'rovirus Rous sarcoma virus (KRV: Jacks $ Varmus. 198.5) . In recent Fears, examples of t,his kind of frameshift. expression strategy have been predicted of documented to occur in many other systems (for a review see Atkins et al., 1990) . Tn RSV, frameshifting links the overlapping gag and pal coding regions enabling production of the gag-pal polyprotein from which reverse t'ranscriptase is derived. An alignment of the gag-pal, gag-pro or pro/p01 overlap sequences of many ret,roviruses or related eukaryotir elements known or suspected to utilize frameshift'ing highlighted a conserved heptanucleot,ide motif containing two homopolymeric triplets of the order XXXYYYN (where X = A, G or IT, Y = A or I' and N is A, (1 or CJ: Jacks et al., 19886) . Amino acid sequencing of the transframe protein has revealed that this sequence motif (termed the \"slippery\" sequence) is the actual site of the rihosomal frameshift in mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV, gag-pro junction; Hizi et nl.. 1987) , human immunodefieiency virus type 1 (HTV-1: Ja,cks rt nf., 1988a), RSV (<Jacks et al., 1988b) , and is likely to be the slip-site in all the other systems including THV. sequence analysis has suggested that RNA pseudoknots are present downstream from the slip-sites in a large number of cases (Brierley rf al., 1989 (Brierley rf al., : t'en T>am et al., 1990 . Thus slippery sequences and RNA pseudoknots (or other secondary structures) appear to be common elements of this class of -1 frameshift event. To account for the conserved slip-site motif in retroviruses, Jacks et al. (19886) proposed a simultaneous slippage model of frameshifting (see Fig. 1 ) in which t'wo adjacent ribosomebound tRNAs decoding the slip sequence in the zero reading frame (i.e. X XXY YYZ) slip back simultaneously by one nucleotide such that bot,h tRSAs are in the -1 phase (XXX YYY) and are basepaired to the mRNA in two out of t,hree anticodon positions.

In those systems in which t,he amino acid sequence of the transframe prot'ein has been determined, it is known that the frameshift occurs within the slippery sequence at the second codon of the tandem slippery pair, i.e. at that codon decoded in the ribosomal A-site (XXXYYYN. zero __-) frame, A-site codon underlined). Amongst natural retroviral slip sequences (* Jacks et al., 19883) and in probably all cases of this class of frameshift signal found to date in viruses (ten Dam et al., 1990) , only three A-site codons (AAC, CUA and UUU) are represented, and it has been suggested that only certain \"shifty\" tRNAs are able to slip at, the A-site (Jacks et al., 1988b) . The potential involvement of specialized tRNAs in the frameshift process was further implicated by the observation that the presence of a G nucleotide at position 7 of the slipsequence (XXXYYYG) greatly reduces frame-shifting in eukaryotic systems (Inglis et al., 1990; Dinman et al., 1991) but not in prokaryotic systems (Weiss et al., 1989; Tsuchihashi, 1991) .",

            "text": "Here, we describe a detailed analysis of the kind of slippery sequences that can function at t,he IB1 frameshift site. Our approach was to replace the TBV slip-sequence with candidate sequences and then to test the ability of synthetic mRNAs containing the variant sites to direct frameshifting in a cell-free translation system. We hoped to be able to determine the frameshift efficiency of a large number of sites. particularly position 7 variants, since this would allow the slipperiness of a range of A-site-decoding tRNAs to be investigated. We firstly confirmed that the site of frameshifting in IBV was at the UUUAAAC sequence, and then used our knowledge of the pseudoknot structure (Brierley et al., 1991) and a suitable report,er gene t:o design an expression construct in which all the terminat,ion codons within the pseudoknot were removed such that frameshifting into any reading frame could be monitored simultaneously. Thus. for each candidate slip sequence, both the magnitude and, to some extent, the direction of frameshifting could be det,ermined. Our results show that in almost all of the sequences tested, frameshifting was strictly into the -I reading frame. However, detectable levels of -S/+ 1 frameshifting (0~5%) were seen with monotonous runs of nucleotides (A,N, C,N, GsS) or when a U triplet was present in the A-site. Significant levels of -2/ + 1 frameshifting were observed with monotonous U tracks (U,N; 2% to S'+/b) and eight consecutive U bases gave very high levels (21%). These observations support the widely held view that runs of U bases in mRNAs are particularly slippy. With respect to the kind of sequences that could functionally replace the IBV slip sequence, we found that, triplets of A, C: G and U were functional when placed in that region of the slip-sequence decoded in the ribosomal P-site following slippage (XXXYYYZ; -1 frame P-site codon underlined), but C-triplets were the least slippy. Only triplets of A and L' were functional in the ribosomal A-site (XXXmZ; -1 frame A-site codon underlined), in agreement with related studies of RSV (Jacks et al., 19888) and L-A frameshifting (Dinman et al., 1991) . Surprisingly, a number of mutations created in the first slippery codon (XXXYYYK, decoded in the P-site) were found to display high levels of frameshifting, despite the apparent reduction in the homopolymeric nature of the slip sequence. This suggests that in certain cases only minimal postslippage mRNA-tRNA pairing is required for efficient frameshifting. The identity of the nucleotide at position 7 of the slip-sequence was found to be a critical determinant of frameshift efficiency and we show here that a hierarchy of frameshifting is seen for the various pre-slippage A-site codons. For the series, XXXAM, the hierarchy for K was C > A N U >>G; for XXXUm, the hierarchy was U > A + C > G. These observations lead us to suggest that frameshifting at a particular site is determined, at least in part, by the strength of interaction of normal tRNAs with the A-site codon and does not necessarily involve specialized \"shifty\" t)RNAs.",

            "text": "We wished to design a construct in which frameshifting into any reading frame could be monitored simultaneously, since this was not possible with pFS8. As the wild-type IBV pseudoknot contains a number of stop codons, we firstly designed an artificial \"minimal\" pseudoknot based on our knowledge of t,his RNA structure (Brierley et al., 19911 , in which loop 2 was reduced from 32 to only 8 nucleotides in length, and all the termination codons were changed to sense codons (see Fig. 3 ). The changes were carefully chosen so as to form a pseudoknot whose structure and predicted stability bore close resemblance to the wild-type pseudoknot. As can be seen in Figure 3 , the minimal pseudoknot differs from the wild-type in a number of ways; loop 2 is 24 nucleotides shorter, the G-A mismatched pair in stem 1 of the wild-type pseudoknot is replaced by a G.U base-pair, the G nucleotide of loop 1 of the wild-type structure is replaced by a C nucleotide and, finally, the minimal pseudoknot has ,no stop codons. There is no difference in the lengths of the two stems in each structure. Previous work (Brierley et al., 1991) has shown that mutations that change the nucleotide sequence of the pseudoknot without greatly influencing the overall structure do not inhibit the frameshift process. Thus, reducing the length of loop 2 to eight nucleotides and changing the sequence of loop 1 ought not to influence frameshifting. However, by replacing the mismatched G-A pair in stem 1 by G.U, one may expect, a moderate increase in the stability of stem 1 and hence a small increase in the frameshift efficiency (Brierlev et aZ., 1991; see later). Having designed the minimal pseudoknot, we then searched available reporter genes for regions in which significant lengths of ORF were present in all three frames. A suitable candidate found was the influenza PB2 gene that contained such a region just downstream from a unique BgZII site beginning at position 456 (Young et al., 1983) . Our strategy wa,s to clone the minimal pseudoknot into the BgZII site such that, the upstream portion of the PB2 gene was in-frame with the IBV la coding region. As the downstream PB2 information was open (to a greater or lesser extent) in all three reading frames, we with a mismatched pair (G7-A24) in stem 1. The singlestranded connecting loops contain 2 (loop 1) and 32 (loop 2) nucleotides, respectively. The termination codon of the la ORF (UGA) is boxed, as is the slippery sequence (UCUAAAC). The nucleotides in loop 2 that, were retained in the minimal pseudoknot are in a larger, bold font. In the minimal pseudoknot, which contains no termination codons, the stems are of the same length and base-pair composition as the wild-type pseudoknot, except that the G7-A24, mismatched pair is replaced by a IJ7.G24 pair. Three other differences are present; the loop 1 G nucleotide is changed to a C; loop 2 contains only 8 of the 32 nucleotides present in the wild%type structure, and the glycine codon immediately downstream from the slippery sequence is replaced by a termination codon (in the la reading frame). could monitor frameshifting into any frame simultaneously by examining the size of the frameshift products on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. The strategy for the construction of this plasmid is shown in Figure 4 and detailed in Materials and Methods. An oligonucleotide (90mer) was synthesized that contained sequences complementary to the minimal pseudoknot, the slip-sequence and a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter. A shorter oligonucleotide was then annealed that contained the reverse complement of the T7 promoter sequence and the single-stranded regions filled by primer extension using the large fragment of DNA polymerase I. The blunt-ended molecules were selfligated and then digested with BglII. The resulting BgZII pseudoknot \"cassette\" was cloned into the BglII site of plasmid pING12 at the aforementioned site in the PB2 gene. The construct was then modified in two ways. Firstly, an inconvenient termination codon (UAA) within one of the PB2 frames was changed to serine (UCA), such that the particular frame in question (zero frame) was extended by some 60 amino acid codons in order to ease assignment of translation products to reading frame. Secondly, a PvuII restriction site was introduced at the 3' end of the inserted cassette. This was carried out to remove a termination codon that was inad-vertently missed during design of the long oligonucleotide, and to provide a suitable restriction site 46X I. Brie&y et al. Figure 4 . The construction of plasmid pFScass5 has been described in detail in the text. Briefly. an oligonucleotide containing sequences complementary to a T7 promoter and the IBV minimal pseudoknot (oligol) was annealed to an oligonucleotide containing the T7 promoter sequence (oligo2) and the single-stranded regions filled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Following self-ligation, a BglII frameshift-signal-containing DNA fragment was isolated and ligated into a reporter gene, the influenza PI32 gene, to create pFScass5. The diagram of pFScass5 shows the minimal frameshift signal (in white) flanked by the influenza PB2 reporter gene (shaded). Linearization of the plasmid with BamHl and in. vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase yields an mRNA (2.4 kb) that. when translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, is predicted to produce a 19 kDa product corresponding to ribosomes that terminate at the new la termination codon (UGA) located immediately downstream from the CUUAAAC sequence (stippled), and a 22 kDa ( -1) frameshift product. Any ribosomes that enter the -2/ + 1 reading frame would produce an 85 kDa product, and any zero frame ribosomes, a 28 kDa product. Plasmids pFScass6 and 7 differ from pFScass5 only by the deletion (pFScass6) or insertion (pFScass7) of a single C nucleotide just downstream from the inserted frameshift cassette.",

Insertion or deletion of the single nucleotide ought to reassign the translation products to a different class of frameshift. Thus in pFScass6, the -1 frame is 28 kDa; the -2( + l), 22 kDa and the zero frame 85 kDa. In pFScass7, the -1 frame is 85 kDa, the -2( + 1) frame 28 kDa and the zero frame, 22 kDa. As can be seen from the translations the constructs produced the expected -1 frameshift products; 22 kDa in pFScass5,28 kDa in pFScass6 and 85 kDa in pFScass7. Thus, all the predicted open reading frames were present and correct. Estimates of the frameshift efficiency of the constructs indicate that some 40% of ribosomes enter the -1 phase at the frameshift site. This is some 10% higher than that seen in the wild-type pseudoknot construct (pFS8) and probably reflects, at least in part, the increased stability of the stem 1 helix in the pFScass constructs. (Using the base-stacking rules of Turner et al. (1988) it can be estimated that introducing the G*U base-pair in stem 1 increases the helix stability by 38 kcal mol-' (1 cal = 4.184 J), from -12.4 kcal mol-' (stem 1 of pFS8) to -16.2 kcal mol-' (stem 1 of pFScass5).) In the pFScass5 translation, the absence of significant quantities of 85 kDa product suggests strongly that frameshifting is strictly into the -1 reading frame. Although a +2 shift would place ribosomes in the same phase, it is very unlikely that this occurs, since the ribosome-bound tRNAs could form only one P-site mRNA-tRNA base-pair and no A-site pairs following a + 2 slip. In addition, we have shown previously that the primary sequence of the triplet downstream from the slip sequence is unimportant in the frameshift process (Brierley et al., 1989) . Furthermore, a + 2 slip is not compatible with the results of amino acid sequencing of retroviral trans-frame proteins (see Introduction).",

When the A-site codon is AAN. this hierarchy is C>A k IJ>>G; when the codon is UIJN, the hierarchy is U> A -C>G. The likeliest, explanation for these observations is that the tRNAs that decode the A-site codons vary in their ability to frameshift. It is not, known whether this is a result of the presence of unusual \"shifty\" tRNAs in the ret,iculocyte lysate, or whether the effect is simply due to differing strengths of interaction of the anticodons of normal tRNAs with the A-site codons.

RCNMV p27-pol slip-sequences within the simultaneous-slip model by invoking the formation of a post-slippage G.IJ mRNA-tRNA base-pair at the non-wobble position 2 in the P-site following a simultaneous-slip (see Table 2A ). Indeed, when we changed the IBV slip-sequence to GGAUUUA (MMTV) or the related sequence GGAAAAC, some 15% and 22% of t,he ribosomes frameshifted at those sites respectively, supporting the idea that a GU pair can be tolerated at this position (see Fig. 7 and Table 2 ). The EAV slip sequence (GUUAAAC), however, is more problematical, in that the simultaneous slip model would predict the formation of an A.U pair at position 2 and a non-Watson-Crick G-A mismatch at the non-wobble position 1 in the P-site. Nevertheless, this slip sequence has been shown to specify a 20% frameshift in the context of an RNA pseudoknot in vivo (den Boon et al, 1991) , suggesting that either the G.A mismatched pair can contribute to post-slippage tRNA-mRNA stability or that, under certain circumstances, stable postslippage pairing is not required. When we tested this slip sequence in the context of the IBV pseudoknot, frameshifting occurred at high efficiency (35% :  Table 2A , Fig. 7) . We further investigated which nucleotide could be tolerated at position 1 of the slip sequence by completing a series of mutants in which the IBV sequence was modified at this position (NCUAAAC) and then prepared a series of other slip sequences in which the first position nucleotide was varied against a background of different first slippery codons (N&AAC, NMUUC, NmAAC, NmtJUC; zero frame, P-site codon underlined). The sites were chosen such that the NAAUUUC NGGAAAC NUUAAAC NUUUUUC ACGUACGUACGUACGUACGU Figure 7 . Unusual P-site combinations. In this Figure, the frameshift properties of a number of slip-sequence mutants are shown. In most of these, the wild-type IBV slip-sequence was replaced by a candidate sequence, e.g. GGAUUUA.",

Indeed in the U7 construct (pFRcasG.lO), which was a stretch of eight U bases (since the c&on immediately downstream from the slip sequence was the zero-frame termination codon, CGA), frameshifting was remarkably efficient, with some 39:& of ribosomes entering the -1 phase, and and the presence (PK+) or absence (F'ti-) of a pseudoknot in bhese constructs is indicated above earh track.",

However, removal of the pseudoknot, in the U, c*onstruct had a much less dramatic effect on frameshifting; with the -1 level reduced by about half (to 21.7?/,) and the -2/ + 1 level only marginally (from 21 (!/o to 200/b). Frameshifting on t,hr U, stretch therefore appears to be relatively indeperldent of downstream RNA structure. Runs of IT bases in coding sequences have been implicated in frameshift events in other systems, including the yeast mitochondrial oxi 1 gene (Fox 8 Weiss-Krummer. 1980 ), bacteriophage 1'7 gene IO (Dunn $ St'udier, 1983 ) and t'he trpE gene of' Salmonella tyiphimurium (Atkins et al., 1983) . The high levels of frameshifting associated with the 'I:, sequence suggests that when ribosomes encounter this stretch t'he ability to monitor reading frame is lost, since t,hey are distributed into each of the three reading frames at high efficiency (39oh, -1; Sl%, -2/+ 1; 40 %, zero frame). Furthermore, even when the downstream pseudoknot was destabilized, reading frame maintenance was still aberrant (22 %, -1; 20%, -2/+ 1; 58%, zero frame). Why the two sequences respond in different ways to the removal of the pseudoknot is not clear, but possible explanations are given in the Discussion. Frameshifting at the gag-pol overlap in HIV-l occurs at a UsA sequence and evidence has accumulated that, unlike most frameshift sites, no downstream RNA structures appear t,o be involved in frameshifting in this system (Wilson et al., 1988; Madhani et al., 1988) . The possibility that a -S/+ 1 frameshift product could be produced from this sequence in &vo has been raised (Kingsman et aZ., 1990) . Our analysis of the U,C construct described here suggests that such a frameshift product would be of low abundance.",

Triplets of G or C and codons ending in G gave very low levels of frameshifting at this position. It is clear from this study that the IBV pseudoknot can act as an enhancer for the frameshift process, and appears to be considerably more effective than the pseudoknots predicted to form downstream from the RSV (Jacks et al., 19886) and L-A (Dinman et al., 1991) slip sites. When the slip-sequences of RSV (A,UsA) and L-A (G,U,A) were placed upstream from the IBV pseudoknot, frameshifting at these sites was at a four-and ninefold greater level, respectively, t.han that seen in their natural context)s. The enhanced frameshifting afforded by the IBV pseudoknot allowed the determination of a hierarchy of frameshift efficiency of A-site codons. ln order to explain this hierarchy, we propose that slip sequences are decoded by the normal pool of cellular tRNAs and the ability to slip at a particular codon is determined by the st'rength of the codonanticodon interaction in the ribosomal A-site before tRNA slippage. We suggest that if this interaction is relatively weak, then slippage is more likely to occur. The ability to form two or more post-slippage mRNA-tRNA contacts is taken as a prerequisite for frameshifting at the A-site. The strength of the interaction between mRNA and tRNA is likely to he influenced considerably by the kind of base-pair that forms between the 3' base of the codon and the 5' base of the anticodon (position 34) at the wobble position (Crick, 1966 ; for a review, see Bjiirk et aZ., 1987) . On this basis, we have surveyed the nature of the anticodons of the tRNAs predicted to be decoding the second slippery codon. We limited the analysis to tRNAs of non-transformed mammalian cells, excluding mitochondrial tRNAs and form our arguments on the basis of only those tRNAs whose sequence and modification pattern have been determined. As a source of information, we used the tRNA sequence compilations assembled by Sprinzl et al. (1989) and the EMBL and NEWEMBL databases.",

On first inspection, one may expect tRNALyS U'UU to recognize both the AAA and the AAG lysine codons, and tRNALyS CUU to recognize only AAG. However. the t J9 modification influences the codon preference of tRNALyS U9UU such that it preferentially recognizes the AAA codon with little aiIinity for the AAG codon (Lustig et al., 1981) . Thus, it, is likely that the AAA and AAG codons are decoded by a separate tRNA. As the AAGCUU codon-anticodon pairing is likely to be more stable than the AAA.UUU pairing, then, according to our hypothesis, AAG should frameshift poorly, since it forms strong pre-slip contacts with the tRNA. This is supported by the lack of frameshifting seen in slip-sequences ending with AAG. The AAA codon, however, would form a weaker pre-slip contact and, as is seen, may be expected to frameshift at a higher level.

            "text": "AAG. in contrast to the situation in eukaryotes, is a very slippery codon. and this mav well be a consequence of having only a single tRNALys species. In eukaryotes, t'he presence of t,he tRNALyS CUlJ isoacceptor may well prevent frameshifting at the AAG codon in the context of \"ret'rovirus-type\" frameshift signal. Hatfield and colleagues have proposed an alternative explanation for the limited number of codons known to be functional in frameshifting, in which frameshifting is mediated by a subset' of hypomodified isoacceptor tRNAs (Hatfield et aZ.. 1990 ). The tRNAs t'hat would decode the t'hree A-site codons found in nat,urally occurrin are tRNA*\"\" (codon AAC), r+h;li~ti;~ncc~ tRNA tRNAL'\" (GUA). These tRNAs are characterized by the fact that tRNA*\"\" contains the highly modified Q base in the 5' position of its anticodon. tRNAPh' the highly modified Wyebutosine (Y 1) or Wyebutoxosine (Y2) base (Sprinzl et al. 1989 ) just to the 3' side of the anticodon, and t,RNAL'\" lacks a highly modified base in its anticodon loop. The hypothesis suggests that hypomodified varianm of tRNAAs\" and t'RNAPh' (and the already \"hypo\"-modified tRNAL'\") would be able to slip at frameshift sites, since the lack of a highly modified base would create more space in and around the frameshift site, which may facilitate frameshifting by allowing greater flexibility of movement of the anticodon (HatfieId et al., 1989; Hatfield & Oroszlan. 1990 ). Experimental support for the idea that hypomodified variants of tRNA*\"\" and tRNAPh\" could be involved in the frameshift process comes from an analysis of the modification status of these tRNAs in cells infected with various retroviruses (Hatfield et al., 1989 Almost all of the mutants tested in the Psite analysis described here were concerned with position 1 of the slip-sequence, since we were intrigued by the observation that the slip-sequence of EAV (GUUAAAC) was functional in viwo (den Boon et al.. 1991) . In our assay, this sequence stimulated frameshifting at a level of 35%. only slightly less efficient than the wild-type IBV sequence (CUUAAAC). This raised the possibility that the predicted postslippage base-pairs, G-A at position 1 and U.A at position 2, may be sufficiently stable to allow frame shifting.",

One possibility is that during a frameshift, unusual basepairs can form and are stable at position 1. Current models for the frameshift process suggest that the RNA structures downstream from the slip-site may function to stall ribosomes over the slippery sequence codons; this pause could directly influence the fidelity of mRNA decoding, and promote the realignment of ribosome-bound tRNAs into the -1 reading frame (Jacks et al., 1988a,b) . Thus, the postslip G.G, C.A and A.A pairs that may form in the functional position 1 mutants (see Table 2 ) could be allowed under the circumstances of a paused ribosome. Surprisingly, the sequence GUCAAAC was also found to stimulate reasonable levels of frameshifting (140/6), despite being expected t'o form only a G-A mismatch at position 1 and a LJC pair at po&ion 2 post,-slippage (see Table BA ). Thus, certain sequencaes do not appear to adhere strongly to the two-out-of-three post-slip contact,s code of the simultaneous slip model. Clearly, more informa.tion is needed before the molecular basis of this P-site misreading is understood, particularly wit,h respecxt to the functionality of G-nucleotides at position 1.",

            "text": "In our analysis of the direction of frameshifting, we have found that at the majority of slip sequences, frameshifting was strict.ly into the -1 reading frame. Significant quantities of -2/+ 1 product, however, were seen when fully homopolymerit U runs (I:,N) were tested (2 to 5%) and a US stretch gave high levels (21%). An important question concerning the frameshift process is whether RNA pseudoknots can influence frameshift direction. Tn the simplest case, RNA pseudoknots may function solely to pause ribosomes; such ribosomes can then frameshift in a direction determined by the nature of the slippery sequence. In the majority of frameshift sites, the likeliest slip is a -1 slip, since this produces the most stable post-slippage mRNA-tRNA base-pairing. In the case of homopolymeric runs, identical post-slip contacts can form following -1 or -2 slips (e.g. in the case of the U,C sequence) or even -1, -2 or + 1 slips (e.g. in the case of the UB sequence). If the pseudoknot plays a role in determining the direction of frameshifting, however, then in the presence of a pseudoknot one would expect a particular class of frameshift to predominate. We investigated this possibility by destabilizing the pseudoknot structure in constructs containing a U,C or U, slip-sequence and tested for frameshifting (see Fig. 8 ). In the U& construct, this resulted in a reduction of both -I and -2/+ 1 frameshifting. In the 1;s construct. however, removal of the pseudoknot had little effect on -2,' + 1 frameshifting, but' reduced -1 frameshifting by about half. These apparently inconsistent effects can be explained if the pseudoknot is able to specifically enhance 5'.wards slippage (minus direction). Tn the C,C construct, the 85 kDa -2/+ 1 product probably arises from a -2 slip rather than a + 1 frameshift, since the phenylalanine tRX'A decoding the A-site codon can form identical post-slip contacts with the mRNA following either a -1 or -2 slip, but not from a + 1 slip. If the pseudoknot does enhance frameshifting in t,he -5' direction, t,hen the reduction in both -1 and -2/( + 1) frameshifting observed in the U,C PK-construct. is perhaps expecbed. In the case of the I:, construct, destabilization of the pseudoknot once again caused a reduction in -1 frameshifting but. in this case, little effect on -2/ + 1 frameshifting was seen. This may be related to the likelihood that both forward and backward slips can occur at the U, sequence: perhaps in the absence of a pseudoknot. + 1 frameshifts occur. whereas in the presence of the structurr, frameshifting may occur mainly into the -2 (and -1) reading frame. As we are unable to dist#inguish between -2 and + 1 shifts in this assay, these int)erpretat)ions must be viewed as speculative, but, the results lend some support to t.he idea that RNA pseudoknots can influence the direction of frameshifting.",
