Cleavage to VP70 is required for release of immature particles from cells, and subsequent cleavage by trypsin confers infectivity. We used electron cryomicroscopy and icosahedral image analysis to determine the first experimentally derived, three-dimensional structures of an immature VP70 virion and a fully proteolyzed, infectious virion. Both particles display T = 3 icosahedral symmetry and nearly identical solid capsid shells with diameters of~350 \u00c5. Globular spikes emanate from the capsid surface, yielding an overall diameter of~440 \u00c5. While the immature particles display 90 dimeric spikes, the mature capsid only displays 30 spikes, located on the icosahedral 2-fold axes. Loss of the 60 peripentonal spikes likely plays an important role in viral infectivity. In addition, immature HAstV bears a striking resemblance to the structure of hepatitis E virus (HEV)-like particles, as previously predicted from structural similarity of the crystal structure of the astrovirus spike domain with the HEV",

            "text": "To date, eight serotypes have been identified of which type 1 is the most prevalent, and type 8 has been studied extensively. While their genomes are fairly well conserved, 4-6 the mature virions of different serotypes vary somewhat in the exact size and number of structural proteins that form the capsid (reviewed by Krishna 7 ) . The current consensus is that morphogenesis of infectious particles relies on a series of proteolytic cleavages of the capsid precursor protein (Fig. 1 ). VP90 assembles in infected cells and undergoes C-terminal cleavages by caspases to generate VP70 (a 70-to 79-kDa protein) for release from the cells as immature virus particles. 8 Generation of infectious particles is dependent upon further trypsin cleavages usually resulting in three structural proteins, VP34, VP27, and VP25, each of which range in actual size and name depending on the serotype. 9-11 VP34 contains the conserved N-terminal domain and is ascribed to the capsid, while the overlapping VP27 and VP25 subunits contain the variable C-domain and are ascribed to the viral spikes. 7,12 VP25 is generated by additional trimming at the N-terminus of VP27. 11 Astroviruses were initially named for the distinctive star-like appearance of their viral surface observed in~10% of the fecally shed viral particles evaluated by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM). EM ultrastructural analysis of infectious HAstV generated in cell culture showed spherical particles with a surface that was studded with spikes and an external diameter of~410 \u00c5. 13 A recent milestone was determination of a highresolution X-ray structure of the P-domain of the astrovirus spike VP25 (ordered residues 430-645). 12 Similarities in sequence and domain organization of hepatitis E virus (HEV) and HAstV enabled the building of a homology model of HAstV.",

We examined (1) immature HAstV-8 particles composed of the 70-kDa intermediate protein, which has undergone caspase but not trypsin cleavage and is therefore not infectious, and (2) fully cleaved, mature infectious particles of HAstV-1. The sequences of the two strains are extremely similar, with 83% identity in the conserved domain and 60% identity in the variable domain. Therefore, we expect that our three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions are representative of the Astroviridae family. Although the capsid shells of both immature and mature HAstVs are nearly identical, there is a striking difference in the apparent stoichiometry of the surface spikes. Immature, uncleaved particles, which are strikingly similar in appearance to HEV-like particles (HEV-lp), 14 Trypsin cleavage of the coat protein between the conserved (white boxes) and variable (shaded boxes) domains is required for viral maturation.

Icosahedral image analysis of electron cryomicrographs (Fig. 2 ) yielded 3D maps at~25 \u00c5 resolution ( Fig. 3a and b ). Both particles display two concentric layers of density that conform to T = 3 icosahedral lattice symmetry. A nearly identical inner layer forms a solid capsid shell 45 \u00c5 thick with an outer diameter of~350 \u00c5. This capsid shell has a chiseled appearance assembled from 180 protein subunits in which trimeric facets form a plateau ( Fig. 3a and b, bottom) . The trimeric facets are in close contact across the icosahedral 2-fold (2F) symmetry axes, with depressions at the 5-fold (5F) and 3-fold (3F) symmetry axes and a groove across the local 2F axes. Distal from the solid capsid shell is an outer layer of globular spike-like densities. The spikes are~40 \u00c5 in diameter, with a somewhat elliptical shape, yielding an outer particle diameter of~440 \u00c5. The stoichiometry suggests that the spikes are dimers with contributions from adjacent trimer facets (Fig. 3a , color code and labels). Thin linker densities connect the spikes to the capsid shells and are visible in 3D reconstructions of negatively-stained particles ( Fig. S1 ) or when the isosurface is lowered significantly in the cryoEM maps. The lack of well-defined linker density may be the result of the narrowness of the linker, minor heterogeneity in maturation cleavage, or wobbling of the spike head, which would obscure the connections during icosahedral symmetry averaging.",

            "text": "Proteolytic cleavage is a common mechanism for activation of both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, including influenza virus, 15, 16 coronavirus, 17 rotavirus, 18 reovirus, 19 and alphaviruses. 20 A recurring theme is that cleavage triggers a conformational change in a surface spike or other cell-attachment domain. For astrovirus, the uncleaved, immature T = 3 particle contains 180 copies of VP70, in which the viral capsid is attributed to the N-terminal domains and the 90 spikes are attributed to dimers of the variable C-terminal domain. Similarly, trypsin cleavage of the immature particles produces three products, of which we correspondingly attribute VP34 to the capsid shell and the two different C-terminal products, VP27 and VP25, to the spikes. SDS-PAGE suggests that trypsin cleaves virtually all of the VP70 molecules (Fig. S2 ). In addition, the 3D reconstruction in Fig. 3b suggests that trypsin cleavage results in release of two-thirds of the spikes in the mature particles. However, we note that the bands of VP27 and VP25 on SDS-PAGE gels display intensities similar to that of VP34, 10 suggesting that trypsin cleavage might lead rather to conformational flexibility and that the products of proteolysis, or a significant percentage of them, could remain noncovalently attached to the capsid shell. Limitations in material have precluded careful quantitative analysis to resolve this question. However, we note that the trypsintreated particles in Fig. 2b have noticably less surface density than the particles in Fig. 2a . If the cleaved proteins remain noncovalently associated with the capsid shell, then one would still expect to see surface density in the images of individual particles, even if the polypeptides do not conform to icosahedral symmetry. Consequently, our working hypothesis is that trypsin cleavage leads to loss of 60 peripentonal spikes, which confers infectivity, possibly by exposing additional receptor binding sites on the capsid surface.",

With no scaling or translation, the maps align very well, except that the HAstV spikes extend to a higher radius (arrow) than those of HEV. Density maps are in gray scale, and for clarity in the enlarged views, the interior density was set to zero at a radius of 120 \u00c5. The backbone chains are color coded by domain as defined in (a) for HEV; S-domain (green), M-domain (blue), and P-domain (red). atomic models match exceedingly well with the HAstV density maps and dock without any scaling: the HEV-lp model into our VP70 immature structure (Figs. 3c and 4a ) and the HAstV model into our mature structure (Figs. 3d and 4b) . The similarity reinforces the supposition that VP34 forms the capsid shell and that VP27/VP25 complexes comprise the spikes. The one noticeable difference between the structures is that the astrovirus spikes extend to a radius greater than that of HEV-lp (Fig. 4a, arrow) .

When the HEV capsid protein is used as the reference sequence, the search identifies the conserved domain from multiple astrovirus species, with the strongest scores for bat and bovine astroviruses (E b 1e \u2212 8 ). It is also interesting to note that, while most astroviruses cause gastroenteritis in their host, duck astrovirus causes fatal hepatitis. 21 Possible similarities in assembly and activation of HAstV and HEV Although the astrovirus polyprotein is larger b\u1ef9 120 residues, there may also be biological similarities between HAstV and HEV. For instance, in vitro assembly of expressed HEV capsid protein requires deletion of the 52 C-terminal residues, which may be analogous to caspase cleavage of VP90 and removal of~125 amino acids to generate VP70 (Fig. 1) . As there is no cell culture system currently capable of propagating HEV, little is known about its infectivity. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to speculate that a cleavage cascade similar to HAstV may be required for both assembly and activation. Furthermore, by analogy with the HEV-lp model, we may be able to infer that the differences between the AB and CC dimers of immature astrovirus is relevant for assembly, in addition to activation. In the case of HEV-lp, there is a measureable difference in the hinge angles between the AB and CC dimers, which may explain the similar differences observed in HAstV. It was proposed for HEV that the flatter angle of the CC dimers is required to make T = 3 rather than T = 1 particles and only happens in the presence of RNA. 14, 22 The need for RNA as a structural component may account for the inability, to date, to assemble stable astrovirus-like particles from expressed proteins. Both systems may provide insights for the other.",

Underfocus values were calculated using Robem \u2021 and ranged from \u2212 1.45 to \u22121.85 \u03bcm. Correlation methods (PPFT) were used to derive particle orientations, and the 3D reconstructions were generated by Fourier-Bessel inversion. 25 Initial models were determined from 10 cycles of the Random Model Calculation. 26 Additional rounds of image processing restricted the data search to the outer radii (r =150-230 \u00c5), but definition of the surface spikes did not improve. The data sets were randomly divided into two groups of particle images, and the two resulting maps were compared by Fourier shell correlation analysis, from which the resolution for both HAstV-1 and HAstV-8 maps was estimated to b\u1ebd 25 \u00c5 using a correlation coefficient cutoff value of 0.5. The final 3D HAstV-8 and HAstV-1 maps were calculated from 332 (of 451) and 397 (of 583) particles, respectively, with selection based on their correlation coefficients. The handedness of both maps was set by matching the capsid features to those of the HEV structure.",

Maps truncated at a radius of 180 \u00c5 (lower panels) display a very similar chiseled morphology and diameter of the capsid shells, which are most likely assembled from the conserved N-terminal domain of VP34. The surface spikes are attributed to dimers of the VP25/VP27 variable domain. A possible scheme for the attachment of the surface spikes to the capsid shell is indicated on the HAstV-8 map (a) by the paired colors of the globular spikes (top panel) and presumed attachment sites (bottom panel), with A, B, and C subunits labeled. Symmetry axes are indicated by symbols on the HAstV-1 map [(b) top panel)]. (c) T = 3 HEV EM structure (emd ID: 5173) low-pass filtered at 25 \u00c5 resolution looks remarkably similar to the architecture of immature HAstV [(a) top panel]. The modeled HEV backbone (PDB ID: 3IYO) was used to more clearly visualize the capsid by generating a 25-\u00c5-resolution map without the P-domains. (d) A model of HAstV calculated by homology with the HEV T = 1 crystal structure 12 (kindly provided by the authors).
