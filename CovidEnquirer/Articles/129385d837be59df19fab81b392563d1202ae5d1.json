For durations of stay less than 14 days, we used the midpoint of the trip length categories in calculations (11) . The overall average duration of stay for travelers to KSA was then estimated by summing the durations of stay of all travelers from non-Middle Eastern countries and dividing by the total number of these travelers. Separate estimates of the average duration of stay were calculated for travelers from high-income OECD countries where possible.",

When estimating the number of severe cases in source countries, we excluded cases among travelers that occurred among foreign residents or citizens of a source country or that were detected as a result of testing before departure from a source country (14) . We excluded these cases since foreign residents and citizens of source countries likely have different travel patterns to visitors (e.g., they may postpone travel if ill), their length of stay in their destination could be shorter than the incubation period, they may wait to seek care until they return home, and data on their travel frequency were also unavailable. MERS-CoV cases who were transported to another country for medical care were also excluded because they occurred among citizens of source countries and they are not representative of average infection risk since their travel was related to their infection status.",

Our estimates of the cumulative number of severe MERS-CoV cases are for the period September 2012, when MERS-CoV was first identified, through January 2016. As described elsewhere, the average rate used by the formula can give appropriate estimates of the cumulative incidence of disease even if the rate of infection varies over time as long as the persontime at risk is uniformly distributed over the outbreak (18) . The calculation assumes that the disease rate is the same across source countries. Analyses using country-specific disease rates could be performed with larger numbers of travel-associated cases. 95% confidence intervals were calculated by using profile-likelihoods (19) . Matlab 2014a was used for statistical analyses.",

Infections that occurred among residents or citizens of source countries which were identified in non-Middle Eastern countries were included in this analysis since the goal was simply to compare rates of passive surveillance between groups of non-Middle Eastern countries. There were 10 such MERS-CoV importation events identified in high-income countries compared to 8 importation events detected in lower-income countries from September 2012 -January 2016 (Technical Appendix Table 1 ). The total number of air travelers to each group of destination countries from source countries was obtained from published estimates (8) . There was a significant difference in the frequency of detection of cases between groups of countries (p < 0.001 by Fisher exact test).",

Consequently, the second case might not provide independent information on the size of the MERS-CoV epidemic in KSA. Additionally, 2 probable, but unconfirmed, MERS-CoV cases occurred in late 2013 among travelers returning from KSA to Spain (21) , and both belonged to the same tour group making it unclear whether they were potentially separate infections or if one could have infected the other.

For Abu Dhabi, the top 25 countries of origin for travelers were listed in official statistics (4) . Therefore, we conservatively assumed that the number of travelers from each of the unlisted countries was equal to the number of visitors from the 25 th placed country. **An additional case-patient was detected in the Republic of Korea (which was classified as a high-income country) but whose source country of infection was unclear (23).

For the OECD analyses, the average length of stay in Saudi Arabia was 10.71 d and 4.49 d for Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The Abu Dhabi and Dubai estimate was used for Qatar and Jordan for OECD analyses due to a lack of country-specific data and because Qatar, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi and Dubai had similar durations of stay for travelers from all non-Middle Eastern countries. #Not all travelers' nationalities were listed individually in Abu Dhabi and Dubai data sources",
