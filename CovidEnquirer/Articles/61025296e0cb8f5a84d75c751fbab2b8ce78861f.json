            "text": "Background: Exacerbations of childhood asthma and rhinovirus infections both peak during the spring and fall, suggesting that viral infections are major contributors to seasonal asthma morbidity. Objectives: We sought to evaluate rhinovirus infections during peak seasons in children with asthma and to analyze relationships between viral infection and illness severity. Methods: Fifty-eight children aged 6 to 8 years with asthma provided 5 consecutive weekly nasal lavage samples during September and April; symptoms, medication use, and peak flow were recorded. Rhinoviruses were identified by using multiplex PCR and partial sequencing of viral genomes. Results: Viruses were detected in 36% to 50% of the specimens, and 72% to 99% of the viruses were rhinoviruses. There were 52 different strains (including 16 human rhinovirus C) among the 169 rhinovirus isolates; no strains were found in more than 2 collection periods, and all but 2 children had a respiratory tract infection. Virus-positive weeks were associated with greater cold and asthma symptom severity (P < .0001 and P 5 .0002, respectively). Furthermore, virus-positive illnesses had increased duration and severity of cold and asthma symptoms and more frequent loss of asthma control (47% vs 22%, P 5 .008). Although allergen-sensitized versus nonsensitized children had the same number of viral infections, the former had 47% more symptomatic viral illnesses (1.19 vs 0.81 per month, P 5 .03). Conclusions: Rhinovirus infections are nearly universal in children with asthma during common cold seasons, likely because of a plethora of new strains appearing each season. Illnesses associated with viruses have greater duration and severity. Finally, atopic asthmatic children experienced more frequent and severe virus-induced illnesses.

            "text": "Despite the close relationships between human rhinovirus (HRV) infections and asthma exacerbations, the relationships between infection and the severity of clinical illness are not completely understood. For example, HRV can cause asymptomatic infections, common colds, or exacerbations of asthma. This gap in knowledge is partly related to difficulties in detecting HRV. Early studies of HRV epidemiology used diagnostics based on tissue culture, which is insensitive. Recent studies using PCR and other molecular techniques indicate that there are new branches on the HRV family tree, [5] [6] [7] [8] and one characteristic of the recently detected HRV-C species is that they cannot be detected by using standard tissue culture. New molecular assays make it possible to conduct epidemiologic studies to identify and evaluate the role of specific strains, including HRV-C, in the activity of chronic asthma. For example, a recent study detected HRV-C in almost half of all children who were hospitalized with rhinovirusassociated respiratory tract illnesses. 9 In addition to limitations related to viral diagnostics, most previous studies have focused on detection of HRV during periods of illness: there is little information about the true rates of infection, which can be asymptomatic. This lack of data related to mild or asymptomatic illnesses has hampered efforts to identify host and viral factors that contribute to the severity of the illness.",

Although other viruses were detected, HRV made up the vast majority of viruses detected during April and September, and up to 18 viral strains were detected in a single month in the Madison, Wisconsin, area. The specific strains of HRV differed dramatically from season to season and year to year, with relatively few strains carried over. This study adds new information about patterns of the different species of rhinovirus, including the newly defined HRV-C. One of the unique features of this study is that we evaluated children with asthma during peak cold seasons irrespective of whether they were having asthma symptoms, cold symptoms, or both. As expected, HRV infections were major contributors to cold and asthma symptoms; however, correlations between viral infections and illness were not absolute. Clearly, nonviral factors also contributed to upper and lower airway symptoms in these children, and many infections (24%) were asymptomatic. Comparison of viral with nonviral illnesses demonstrated that viral illnesses lasted longer, were more severe, and were more likely to be associated with loss of asthma control. Finally, children with allergic sensitization had similar rates of viral infections but significantly increased rates and severity of viral illnesses compared with children who were not sensitized.",

It is of particular interest that there was an extensive diversity of HRV strains detected in one community over the 3-year study period. Almost all of the strains detected each season were new (72% to 100%), and no one strain was detected in more than 2 collection periods. These findings are in substantial agreement with early studies of HRV epidemiology that used culture alone to detect HRV strains 16, 17 and add new information about patterns of newly defined HRV species. Although the strains varied from season to season and year to year, the species clustered into a pattern: HRV-A in the spring, HRV-B in the fall, and HRV-C in both seasons. This pattern is different than what has been reported in a previous study of hospitalized children with asthma in which HRV-C appeared to predominate in the fall. 9 Given the high rate of change, a longer period of evaluation will be needed before any firm conclusions can be reached regarding the seasonality of HRV species.",

On the other hand, there was a positive correlation between viral infection and asthma symptom severity. In addition, we found that viral illnesses were more severe, with longer durations of cold and asthma symptoms and more loss of asthma control compared with that seen with nonviral illnesses.

The results are consistent with observations in previous studies that have suggested that sensitization to aeroallergens is a significant risk factor and might be critical for severe viral illnesses. 10, 11, 18, 19 Furthermore, it has also been suggested that sensitization and allergen exposure or viral infection alone do not act as independent risk factors for an asthma hospitalization; rather, they only increase the risk in combination. 18 Because there are currently no effective antiviral treatments for common cold viruses, there is a need for clinical studies to determine whether controlling allergic inflammation is an effective strategy for reducing the risk of severe virus-induced asthma symptoms in allergic subjects.",

Additional studies are needed to determine whether there are specific characteristics of these viruses that promote wheezing and acute asthma. These data also show that respiratory tract illnesses associated with viruses are more severe and of longer duration and provide further evidence of interactions between allergy and virus-induced respiratory morbidity. Understanding the mechanisms for these interactions might be the key to designing novel and more effective treatments or preventive strategies for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma. ",
