            "text": "The secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells comprises a succession of compartments, the secretory organelles, through which proteins pass en route to their final destinations. Although each secretory organelle has its own special characteristics, a number of basic features are common to all of them. Some proteins pass more or less unimpeded through the entire length of the secretory pathway, whereas others are retained in secretory organelles. This raises two of the fundamental questions which will be addressed in this chapter, namely, what determines whether a protein will be taken out of circulation at a particular step in the pathway, and how tight is the separation between secretory organelles?",

Furthermore, specific proteins are known to reside in individual compartments of the Golgi apparatus. As we shall see, the physical separation of Golgi enzymes is also indicated by the succession of posttranslational modifications to which secretory proteins are subjected, by in situ immunocytochemistry, and by the separation of Golgi-derived vesicles containing different en zymes. How then do secretory proteins move between these compart ments, and is the secretory pathway a continuous gradient of secretory organelles or are they functionally and structurally independent?",

Consequently, soluble secretory proteins never come into direct contact with the outer face of the organelle to which they are being targeted and therefore can play no direct part in sorting. Integral membrane proteins usually have segments exposed on the cytoplasmic face of the transport vesicle which could be recognized by receptors on the target organelle. Microinjected antibodies recognizing the C-terminal, cytoplasmic tails of plasma membrane proteins can prevent their trans port to the cell surface (25, 590) , but this is probably due to antibodyinduced changes in protein conformation which make the protein incom petent for transport along the secretory pathway, rather than to inhibition of receptor-secretory protein interactions.",

The rate at which molecules are transported out of the cell will thus be determined by the rate at which they diffuse to sites within the RER and Golgi where transport vesicles are formed and depart en route to the next compartment in the chain. This flow rate has recently been measured with the N-glycosylation acceptor tripeptide Asn-Tyr-Thr (Section V.B.I). If this tripeptide contains a radioiodinated Tyr residue, its progress through the secretory pathway, which it seems to enter by diffusing across the RERM, can be followed by chromatography and autoradiography. Wieland et al. (1190) found that the tripeptide was gly cosylated in the ER (this prevented it from leaking back into the cytosol), then trimmed by mannosidases located in the Golgi (Section V.D), and finally secreted into the medium. Tripeptide was detected in the medium after 5-10 min, depending on the cell type, which is considerably faster than the time required for the transport of most secretory proteins through the secretory pathway. Thus, bulk flow is very efficient, implying that diffusion through the lumen of the ER and Golgi can occur relatively easily and that there is massive, vectorial movement of vesicles between the organelles and the cell surface. The way in which this result influences our understanding of protein sorting in the secretory pathway is discussed in following sections.",

Isolated tripeptides can act as acceptors only when the two extremities are blocked. Longer ac ceptor peptides are more rapidly glycosylated (577). As shown in Fig.  V .l, the entire complex is assembled before it is attached to the Asn residue in the lumen of the RER. At least some sugars cross the RERM as intermediates complexed with the long-chain lipid dolichol, whereas others may cross the RERM as nucleotide 5 '-diphosphate-sugar complexes. However, it is by no means certain that the complex is assembled entirely within the lumen of the RER. For example, there is no evidence that GDP-mannose can be trans ported across the RERM, leading to the proposal that the five mannose residues are added via GDP-mannose donors on the cytoplasmic face of the RERM, whereas later modifications, and possibly earlier modifica tions, occur in the lumen. This presupposes that the dolichol-PP-(NAGn) 2 complex can \"flip\" from the lumen to the cytoplasmic face and then back again once the five mannose residues have been added [see (452) for further discussion of the topology of glycosylation reactions in the RER]. The preferred donor lipid-carbohydrate complex is the com plete complex shown in Fig. V.l (1129) . However, truncated versions lacking glucose and even mannose residues can act as donors in vitro, and under-glycosylated complexes can act as donors in vivo in yeasts (598) and protozoa (577) . Variations in the mannose content of transferred oligosaccharides have also been reported (577).",

This provides a valuable tech nique for studying the role of N-glycosylation in protein traffic. The yeast (S. cerevisiae) gene (ALG7) coding for the RERM-associated, tunicamycin-sensitive enzyme (UDP-NAGn : dolichol-P-transferase) was cloned by virtue of its ability to rescue tunicamycin-treated cells when present on multiple copy number plasmids (931). Null mutations in ALG7 are lethal. Mutants affected in other stages in the yeast glycosylation pathway have been isolated by mannose suicide selection (Section II.F.l.b). Only muta tions blocking the earliest stages in the pathway are lethal; incomplete dolichol-linked oligosaccharides containing a minimum of four mannose residues allow normal growth, presumably because they can be attached to secretory proteins if the full-length lipid-oligosaccharide complex is absent (see above) (598).",

This may be because they rapidly become inaccessible within the structure of the folded polypeptide, although other explanations are possi ble (577, 968) . An unexplained anomaly is that some ER membrane glyco proteins have glycosylated residues exposed on the cytoplasmic face of the ER (1). One explanation could be that additional NAGn transferases are present on the cytoplasmic face of the smooth ER, where these glyco proteins are predominantly located.",

In S. cerevisiae cells, a single al-2-linked mannose residue is replaced by \u03b1\u03ca-3 mannose. A mutation in the GLS1 gene coding for \u03b1 1-2 glucosidase does not affect removal of the mannose residue or subsequent chain elongation, whereas removal of the ninth al-2-linked mannose residue may be essential for outer chain elongation, which occurs in the Golgi (Section V.D.I) (598).

However, disulfide bridge forma tion is probably catalyzed by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which is loosely associated with the RERM (325,326). The formation of soluble protein complexes occurs shortly after synthesis (604), but trimerization of VSV G protein and influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), both of which are integral membrane proteins, occurs only 7-10 min after synthesis (193, 194, 364, 589) and involves the selection of polypeptides from a ran dom pool of prefolded monomers rather than from a restricted pool of monomers synthesized on a single polysome (108). Kreis and Lodish (589) suggest that this delay may be due to the segregation of PDI in a late \"compartment\" of the ER. According to the papers discussed above, oligomerization of G and HA occurs just before they leave the ER, 5-10 min after synthesis. This view is challenged, however, by Yewdell et al. (1222) , who found that mono clonal antibodies specific for oligomerized HA reacted only with proteins in the Golgi apparatus, and not with HA in the ER (see next section). A possible explanation for this ambiguity is that HA monomers fold and trimerize in the ER and are then transported to the Golgi apparatus, where further modifications alter the conformation of the HA trimers to produce the antigenic sites recognized by the antibody used by Yewdell et al.",

The site at which the secretion lag is most prominent seems to be transit from the RER to the Golgi (646). It has been suggested that this delay might reflect the need for secretory proteins to interact with specific receptors in the RER for transport to the Golgi and that carbohydrates might form part of the recognition signal (320,647,648). Alternatively, proteins may be retained in the ER until they have folded correctly; different folding kinetics may result in different retention times in the ER (589,1192). Indeed, exit from the ER of one of the proteins studied by Fitting and Kabat (320) coincided with a partial proteolysis event, and polypeptides were \"selected\" for exit from a random pool of \"new\" and \"old\" proteins. Furthermore, studies discussed in the preced ing section showed that oligomerization of virus-encoded membrane pro teins occurs just before they are transported to the Golgi.",

Haas and Wabl (413) first detected this protein (BiP) complexed with immunoglobulin heavy chains synthesized in the absence of light chains (heavy and light chains are only transported to the Golgi as complexes) (97), and it was subsequently found to be complexed with incorrectly oligomerized or monomeric HA (194, 364) , nonglycosylated invertase (in vitro in dog pancreatic microsomes) and incorrectly folded prolactin (557), and recombinant human factor VII in Chinese hamster ovary cells (561). It was not detected in association with aggregated VSV G protein (250) or with incorrectly folded (mutant) class I histocompatibility antigen (1192). The dissociation of secretory protein-BiP complexes requires ATP (758), which might explain part of the ATP requirement for protein movement along the secretory pathway, but be cause ATP is usually present in cell ly sates, some BiP complexes (such as G-BiP) may dissociate during extraction. BiP has also been shown to associate with nascent polypeptides as they enter the lumen of the ER (557).",

Glucose starvation is likely to reduce glycosylation, thereby increasing the proportion of incorrectly folded secretory proteins in the ER. Studies have confirmed the idea that the extent of glycosylation can affect the association between secretory proteins and BiP, as well as their rate of secretion (251). The accumulation of misfolded (mutant) pro teins in the ER also increases BiP synthesis (583), possibly because the cell senses that its store of BiP has been sequestered into protein com plexes. Thus, synthesis of BiP may be increased according to require ments (857), but studies on the \"proofreading\" or quality control role of BiP are still at an early stage. A different, cytoplasmic quality control protein may be responsible for proofreading cytoplasmic domains in transmembrane proteins to ensure that they too are correctly folded and oligomerized (406a).",

Nonglycosylated G protein was transported from the ER to the Golgi but did not reach the cell surface. When only one of the Asn residues was de leted, the protein reached the cell surface; thus G protein with one glyco sylated Asn residue can be transported through the entire secretory path way. G protein export became temperature-sensitive when new glycosylation sites were added (671). Kotwal et al. (581) noted that some natural G protein variants have only one oligosaccharide whereas others have none at all and suggested that compensatory changes in primary structure may allow nonglycosylated protein to fold into a secretion-com petent conformation.

The rotaviral type II ER membrane protein VP7 was found to be secreted when the two potential N-terminal transmem brane segments were deleted (884), suggesting that retention-salvage de pended on a membrane anchor domain. However, subsequent studies showed that the entire N-terminus was absent from mature VP7 (1084) and thus that some other feature must account for VP7 retention in the ER (883c). Although deletion of the C-terminal transmembrane and cyto plasmic tails of the type I ER membrane protein \u039519 of adenovirus also causes the protein to be secreted, deletion of the last eight residues (FIDEKKMP) of the C-terminal, cytoplasmic tail alone causes the protein to appear on the cell surface, suggesting that the C-terminus contains the ER retention-salvage signal. Furthermore, cell-surface interleukin 2 re ceptor protein \u03b2 chain was converted into a resident ER protein following fusion of FIDEKKMP to its cytoplasmic C-terminus (832). The cytoplas- mically exposed signal could be recognized by \"salvage receptors\" in the transitional element. These studies on the \u039519 protein are reminiscent of earlier, seminal work on the soluble ER protein BiP which resulted from the observation that three soluble proteins in the lumen of the ER, including BiP, had the same four residues, Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL), at their C-termini. Munro and Pelham (759) found that if this sequence was deleted or extended, BiP was secreted into the medium. This suggests that KDEL is the ER reten-tion signal and that it must be at the extreme C-terminus, which is pre sumably the last segment of the polypeptide to fold and may therefore be exposed on the surface of the protein. In a complementary study, DNA coding for KDEL was fused to the end of a cDNA clone coding for secreted lysozyme. The resulting hybrid protein was retained in a perinu clear region probably corresponding to the ER (759).",

Sequential action of these enzymes results in the transfer of TV-acetyl glucosamine-1-phosphate from UDP-NAGn to any one of five mannose residues in the oligosaccharide core, followed shortly afterwards by the removal of the jV-acetylglucosamine to expose the phosphomannosyl group (577).

Lysosomal enzymes presumably contain signals which are recognized by the phosphorylating enzymes (919). Deglycosylated (endoglycosidase \u0397-treated) lysosomal cathepsin D is not a substrate for the phosphoryl ation reaction in vitro, but it inhibits phosphorylation of intact lysosomal enzymes. Proteolytic fragments of glycosylated cathepsin D are also not phosphorylated, and do not inhibit phosphorylation when they are dephosphorylated, indicating that the \"phosphorylation signal\" is probably not a linear sequence of amino acids (612). Frog oocytes are also able to recognize the phosphorylation signal of human cathepsin D (301). Renin is closely related to cathepsin D and yet is secreted by mammalian cells, presumably because it lacks the phosphorylation signal. However, renin produced in oocytes is phosphorylated, remains intracellular, and is de graded (presumably in the lysosome) (302).

The best characterized examples of this class of processed secretory proteins are \u03b1 factor and killer toxin of yeasts.

This probably represents a way of reducing \"shipping costs\" since \u03b1 factor itself may be too small to be efficiently transported to the RERM and it would be inefficient to pad the polypeptide out with redundant sequences (602). Julius et al. (545) found that pro-a-factor processing was blocked by sec mutations, which prevented protein movement through the Golgi, and that mature \u03b1 factor was normally present in secretory vesicles en route to the cell surface. Thus, processing occurs in the Golgi. Some viral coat proteins such as influenza virus HA are also proteolytically processed in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or trans Golgi. Processing of mammalian prohormones, which is similar to that of pro-\u03b1 factor, occurs in secretory granules budding from the trans Golgi [see Section V.G.4.C and (1003)]).",

According to these data, Golgi stacks must contain at least three distinct cisternae (generally referred to as cis, medial, and trans according to their orientation with respect to the ER). Heterogeneity within these \"domains\" indicates that the actual number of cisternae is probably higher than three (see Table V .l, Fig. V .3) (299). Cells normally have one or a very limited number of Golgi stacks. The stacks break up into clusters of many vesicles during mitosis, apparently to ensure equal partitioning of Golgi components to daughter cells, although the number of Golgi clusters produced is far in excess of that required for this pur pose. Golgi breakdown presumably involves membrane fission, so each cluster of vesicles contains cis, medial, and trans components (662).

Similar vesicles were also found around the Golgi apparatus in situ (996, 1088) .

The ionophore monesin (Section V.E.4) probably prevents movement though the trans cisternae by disrupting a proton gradient maintained by an ATP-dependent protein pump present in Golgi membranes (48), thus causing the pH of the normally acidic trans Golgi cisternae to rise. Saraste and Hedman (994) demonstrated that mi gration between different Golgi cisternae was blocked at different critical temperatures and suggested that this might be caused either by ATP depletion or by changes in membrane fluidity. ATP may be required to maintain the acidic pH of trans cisternae, and vesicle fission and fusion, which must occur at the cisternal membranes, can probably only occur when membrane lipids are in a \"fluid\" state above the phase transition temperature. ATP and soluble cytosolic factors including a 74-kDa, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive protein (93a) are required in both early and late stages of intra-Golgi movement in vitro (39,40,685a,966) and in permeabilized cells (62). Intriguingly, soluble yeast cell extracts can replace endogenous cy toplasmic components in a mammalian cell-derived assay system for in tra-Golgi movement of proteins (268), raising the possibility of using ex tracts from yeast sec mutants blocked at different stages in the secretory pathway to define the role of the corresponding wild-type gene products in intra-Golgi transport. Indirect evidence based on the effects of GTP analogs suggests that GTP is also needed for intra-Golgi movement of secretory proteins (710), and studies with antibodies against a yeast GTP binding protein indicate that a similar protein is apparently located in the Golgi apparatus in multicellular eukaryotes (1030). The significance of this observation is not understood, but GTP and GTP binding proteins (G proteins) may be involved in maintaining vectorial movement of shuttle vesicles or in vesicle recycling (see below). Surface components on Golgi membranes are also required for intra-Golgi transport (3,39,40). A recep tor may recognize the protein coat on the Golgi transport vesicles.",

Priming probably involves the migration of secretory proteins to regions of the cisternae where budding occurs, princi-pally at the outer rims. This step might depend on interactions be tween the secretory protein and receptors migrating to the budding areas or may rely on free diffusion within the cisternal membrane or lumen. Segregation may depend on signals generated by processing enzymes in individual Golgi cisternae, but most experiments in which processing inhibitors have been used do not support this idea and show instead that processing is nonessential for secretory pro tein targeting. Some mutationally altered secretory proteins, how ever, transit normally through the early stages of the secretory path way and yet are not transported through the Golgi (344,1040). Perhaps secretory proteins must fold into a particular conformation to be competent for movement between Golgi cisternae. The accu mulation of such abnormal proteins in the Golgi may cause it to become distended, but this does not drastically affect intra-Golgi movement and secretion of other secretory proteins (344). (ii) Vesicles move from one cisterna to another. Vesicle migration be tween Golgi cisternae may be either vectorial or random. Vectorial movement is more compatible with traditional views on the strict sequence of events in secretory protein processing and is supported by the observation that the likelihood of forward transfer is at least five times greater than that of lateral movement in Golgi of fused cells (969, 970) . This implies that there are receptors on the surfaces of Golgi cisternae which recognize vesicles budding from the pre ceding cisterna in the chain. Nonetheless, the topology in the Golgi complex is well maintained, possibly because the cytoskeleton pre vents cisternae from coming into direct contact. Another puzzling feature of vesicular intra-Golgi transport is that small transport vesi cles would be expected to diffuse away from the Golgi complex. The cytoskeleton may restrict the movement of Golgi vesicles and may even play a more positive role in directing vesicles between cister nae. However, although movement along microtubules has been well documented for large organelles (1136) and may be important in the sorting of some proteins leaving the Golgi complex (Section V.G.3), there is no evidence that it could play more than a minor role in the movement of vesicles over the very short distances which separate Golgi cisternae (139). Furthermore, cell fusion studies by Rothman et al. (969) show that inter-Golgi movement of VSV G protein can occur, indicating either fusion of the two Golgi com plexes or, more likely, that movement between Golgi cisternae is dissociative; i.e., the vesicles do indeed diffuse into the cytoplasm.

We saw earlier that receptor-dependent recycling of ER proteins from the cis Golgi or an intermediate compartment could explain how these proteins remain almost entirely in the ER (Section V.B.4). Golgi residents proba bly also have signals which are recognized by some kind of receptor. Indeed, coronavirus El membrane glycoprotein appears to have a Golgi retention signal in one of its transmembrane domains (670). However, recycling of escaped proteins is a far less attractive model for explaining how Golgi proteins are retained than it is for the case of ER proteins. One possibility, proposed by Pfeffer and Rothman (872) , is that the membranes of Golgi cisternae have two domains: a fluid domain, close to the budding rims, and an immobile phase, in which endogenous membrane proteins are anchored. A protein would require a signal to associate with a recep tor in the immobile phase or to become anchored to it, whereas all other proteins would enter the mobile membrane phase or the bulk phase of the cisternal lumen. Pfeffer and Rothman point out that this model reduces the number of proteins which need to have signals for routing through or retention in the Golgi, because fewer proteins are retained in the Golgi than transit through it. Cytoskeletal structures, including possibly the cytoplasmic matrix, which \"glues\" the cisternae together, were proposed to limit movement in the immobile phase. An alternative idea, also con sidered by Pfeffer and Rothman, is that endogenous Golgi proteins inter act to form patches which, by virtue of their size, are too small to fit into transport vesicles.",

Whether this is significant for the role of SEC4 in secretion is unclear, especially since it is not known whether GTP is required for exocytosis in yeasts. Recent studies show that SEC4 protein binds GTP (391). Overexpression of SEC4 suppresses the effects of mutations in three other SEC genes, but strains carrying sec4ts muta tions rapidly become secretion-defective at the nonpermissive tempera ture, suggesting a direct role in secretion. The cytoplasmic and secretory vesicle membrane-associated SEC4 product does not itself appear to be a secretory protein because its predicted primary sequence does not in clude a potential secretory routing signal. One possibility raised by Salminen and Novick is that the C-terminal cysteine residue of SEC4 is acylated, as are the GTP-binding RAS proteins and that the acyl groups anchor the polypeptide in the membrane, but this could not be confirmed directly. Another GTP binding protein, YPT1 (which is 50% homologous to SEC4) was detected close to the bud as well as in ill-defined structures (possibly the ER and Golgi) of S. cerevisiae cells (1030). Mutations in the YPT1 gene affect several stages in the secretory pathway, but YPT1 pro tein probably plays an indirect role in protein transport as a result of its role in Ca 2 + regulation (1014).",

However, the surface area of the apical membrane is usually much smaller than that of the basolateral membrane, which means that the fidelity of apical tar geting is actually quite high (about 88%) (873). Basolateral and apical sorting seem to represent two distinct pathways, but most polarized cells also secrete some proteins from both surfaces, implying that neither basolateral nor apical sorting are default pathways (390,574). Furthermore, lysosomal proteins are secreted by the default pathway from both apical and basolateral surfaces when lysosomal sort ing is blocked (140). This may not be the case in Caco-2 cells in which high-level basolateral secretion of normally nonpolarized lipoproteins im plies that the basolateral sorting predominates over all other sorting path ways, including the default pathway (136,930a).",

Conversely, Pfeffer et al. (873) showed that pulse-labeled G protein went directly to the basolateral mem brane, where it could be detected with specific monoclonal antibodies. Another approach to studying the sorting of HA and G proteins is to ''freeze\" them in the Golgi apparatus by cooling the cells to 20\u00b0C (which specifically blocks protein exit from the TGN) or to use cells infected with viruses carrying temperature-sensitive mutations in the HA or G genes at the restrictive temperature. The bulk movement of these proteins can thus be followed by immunocytochemistry when the cells are restored to the permissive temperature. Rindler et al. (929) found that Gts protein was transported directly from the Golgi to the adjacent lateral cell sur face, whereas wild-type HA accumulated at 20\u00b0C was sorted directly to the region of the apical surface closest to the TGN. Similarly, Pfeiffer et al. (873) found that G protein accumulated in the TGN went to the baso lateral membrane 67 times faster than to the apical surface when the cells were warmed to 37\u00b0C. These studies are compatible with the idea that apical and basolateral proteins go directly to their respective target mem branes. Different results were reported by Bartles et al. (50) , who found that endogenous apical proteins in hepatocytes appeared first in the baso lateral membrane and were subsequently redistributed to the apical sur face by transcytosis (Section VIII.A.5.b). Whether this result indicates the existence of totally different mechanisms for sorting apical proteins in kidney and liver cells could be tested by expressing hepatocyte genes for apical proteins in MDCK cells.",

            "text": "Sorting of polarized secreted and membrane proteins is assumed to de pend on sorting signals (probably signal patches) [see Section I.D.2 and (88)] present in the sorted proteins and on their interaction with receptors. Sorting presumably occurs in the TGN, where at least one set of cognate receptors are probably located. To date, the primary approach used to locate sorting signals has been to introduce major sequence alterations including the deletion of cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains from the HA, G, or other polarized viral glycoproteins, or to create hybrids be tween them. Even these relatively unsophisticated studies give conflicting results. For example, McQueen et al. (702) and Roth et al. (959) found that either deleting the transmembranous and cytoplasmic tail of HA (to make a soluble, secreted protein) or replacing them with the correspond ing regions of G did not affect apical targeting and concluded that the apical sorting signal was located in the N-terminal, extracytoplasmic do main of HA. Gonzalez et al. (387) reported, however, that truncated HA was secreted by the default pathway and concluded that the sorting signal was in the C-terminal transmembranous or 10-amino-acid cytoplasmic domains. There is also disagreement concerning the location of the G protein basolateral sorting signal, which, according to the deletion and HA gene fusion studies of Paddington et al. (835) and Gonzalez et al. (387) is located in the 29-amino-acid, C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Stephens and Compans (1080) McQueen et al. (703) have suggested that the origin of these conflicting results may be the fact that recombinant genes are not stably expressed in MDCK cells. Their studies (702,703) were carried out shortly after infec tion by recombinant viruses and are, they claim, more likely to reflect the true sorting pathway of the recombinant gene product. Other groups may in fact be studying the sorting of hybrid or truncated proteins which have been further modified by genetic selection for more stable cell lines. An other argument in favor of the idea that sorting signals are in the extracy toplasmic domain is that this part of the signal is initially localized in the lumen of the TGN, where sorting is presumably initiated, and could there fore bind to hypothetical sorting receptors which segregate sorted pro teins from those destined for default export or secretion. These receptors may themselves have cytoplasmic domains recognized by receptors on the basolateral or apical surfaces. Furthermore, such a system could han dle both secreted and exported (membrane) proteins. However, there is some evidence, based on the effect of NH 4 C1 (or pH) on basolateral sorting of laminin and heparin sulfate proteoglycan, that soluble and membrane proteins may be sorted by different mechanisms (142).",

Sorting receptors are presumably re cycled. Little is known about how the vesicles are targeted to different regions of the plasma membrane. One possibility is that sorting of lipids ( Fig. V.5) is involved (709,1050a) . Alternatively, sorting vesicles could interact with components of the cytoskeleton, along which they are driven by ATP-dependent motors attached to microfilaments; further receptor-ligand interactions might complete the sorting process when vesi cles arrive at the plasma membrane (1136). Although there is no evidence that microfilaments are required for default sorting of secretory proteins (1136), Rindler et al. (930) have reported that colchicine and other microtubule-disorganizing agents abolished specific apical sorting of HA and caused influenza virus to bud from both cell surfaces in polarized cells. Salas et al. (986) obtained the opposite result, however, and neither group observed any effect on basolateral targeting of VSV G protein. Rogalski (944), however, found that agents which caused microtubule disassembly caused random sorting of G protein. Thus, the role of the cytoskeleton in the targeting of polarity-sorted secretory proteins in complex eukaryotes' proteins remains unclear. A temperature-sensitive mutation in the S. cerevisiae actin gene results in abnormal exocytosis and bud formation at the nonpermissive temperature, suggesting that actin filaments may direct secretory vesicles to the growing bud in yeast cells (793).",

V.4 and 6; see also Section V.G.6) (824,1122). The clathrin coat is subse quently removed as the condensing granules bud from the TGN and ma ture (818) (see Fig. V.6 ).

It remains to be determined whether this is due to incorrect sorting or to low-level, secretagogue-independent secretion from storage granules, as suggested by studies by von Zastrow and Castle (1231).

The hybrid protein was diverted into the regulated secretory pathway, indicating that the constitutive pathway had been bypassed due to sorting signals present in the growth hormone part of the hybrid. There are no obvious sequence similarities between proteins secreted by the regulated pathway, implying that the sorting signal is probably a patch signal rather than any identifiable linear stretch of amino acids. Several proteins secreted via the regulated pathway are proteolytically processed prior to their release from the cell (see below). This raises the possibility that the sorting signal could reside in that part of the secretory polypep tide which is eventually cleaved off. This possibility was tested by Bur gess et al.

Low pH in condensing secre tory granules may dissociate proteins from their receptors, which can then be reused (but see Section V.G.4.b).

Although receptor-mediated sorting into specific regions of the TGN may assist the condensation process, proteins secreted by the regulated pathway may aggregate spontaneously and be packaged into secretory granules when they reach a critical size. Thus, the packaging of G protein-growth hor mone hybrids into secretory granules discussed above (731) may be due to the presence of \"aggregation\" sequences in the growth hormone segment of the polypeptide, rather than to the presence of a specific sorting signal. The low pH of the condensing granule (19,824) may be important for protein aggregation, since aggregates dissociate at high pH (534). Pfeffer and Rothman (872) suggest that this could explain the failure of chloroquinone-treated cells to package secretory proteins into secretory gran ules (see above). Secretory granules of exocrine (hormone-secreting) cells remain acidic during maturation, but those of endocrine (enzyme-secret ing) cells return to neutral pH as they mature (534).

Similar results were reported by Mroz and Lechene (744) , who showed that the enzyme content of individ ual secretory granules derived from single cells from the same gland can vary enormously. The simplest interpretation of these data seems to be that segregation is a random process and that the formation of mixed or pure aggregates depends on the local concentration of the respective pro teins and on their preference for forming homo-rather than heteroaggregates.

Processing often involves the proteolytic removal of an N-terminal propeptide and can be mimicked by exogenous proteases such as trypsin (336). Alternatively, short spacer peptides may be removed from polyprotein precursors (187). In the latter cases, cells in different tissues can process the precursors to give different \"mature\" forms. This is the case for prosomatostatin, which is processed to a 28-amino-acid form by cells in the gut and to a 14-amino-acid form by brain and pancreatic cells (790). Islet tissue from angler fish pancreas contains at least two proteases which process prosomatostatin to give products of different lengths. One of these proteases can also process proinsulin (674) . Other examples of processing of heterologous secretory proteins (188, 444, 732) indicate the existence of only a limited number of processing proteases, which may also be found in some cell types which do not have a regulated secretory pathway (444, 1168) . When secretory proteins which would normally use the regulated pathway are produced in cells which do not have the regu-lated pathway, however, they are constitutively secreted as unprocessed (pro-) forms (889). The site of proinsulin processing was determined cytochemically by Orci et al. (816, 825) , using monoclonal antibodies specific for mature insulin. Fully processed insulin was first detected in clathrin-coated vesi cles budding from the TGN, and subsequently in naked granules. Process ing was coincident with condensation and acidification and was inhibited at higher pH, indicating that the two proinsulin-processing proteases have low pH optima (821). Therefore, this and other proteolytic processing steps probably occur in a late \"compartment\" of the TGN.",

Secretagogues bind to specific cell-surface receptors and promote Ca 2 + influx, which seems to be intimately related to the fusion event (756). GTP binding proteins also seem to be involved in generating the signal which stimu lates secretion (138), and microtubules may play a minor role in directing storage granules to the cell surface (112). Inhibitors of metalloprotease and dipeptide protease substrates inhibit exocytosis, suggesting that pro teolytic cleavage of a membrane protein may be essential for exocytosis.

The large increase in capacitance probably results from productive fusion be tween the plasma and granule membranes (312), whereas capacitance \"flutters\" may represent nonproductive membrane association. The most plausible interpretation of these data is that release of secretory granule contents is preceded by the formation of a narrow channel, the fusion pore, (121) between the two membranes, leading eventually to the open ing of the granule membrane to the outside of the cell and the subsequent swelling and dissociation of the granule contents and their release as soluble proteins.",

Thus, ly sosomal enzymes probably do transit through the TGN, possibly already complexed with their receptor, although Farquhar (299) argues strongly in favor of multiple lysosomal sorting pathways and in particular for sorting from the cis Golgi in certain cell lines. Thus, the site of accumulation of M6P receptors along the secretory pathway may have little relevance for lysosomal enzyme sorting. Two M6P receptors (275 kDa and 46 kDa) have been identified and characterized. The receptor activity of the 275-kDa protein, but not that of the 46-kDa protein is cation-independent, and the 46-kDa receptor recognizes only phosphomonoesters whereas the 275-kDa protein also binds methylphosphomannosyl residues (461). The 275-kDa protein ap pears to be present in most mammalian cell lines tested so far (982), but the distribution of the 46-kDa receptor has not been determined. Some mutant cell lines lack the 275-kDa M6P receptor yet still target lysosomal enzymes normally, which suggests that both receptors are involved in lysosomal sorting (461). Studies with such cell lines revealed another difference between the two receptors, however. Although part of the cellular pool of both receptors is located on the cell surface, only cells with the 275-kDa protein can endocytose secreted lysosomal proteins (1077). This \"defect\" in the 46-kDa protein appears to be due to a failure to bind the ligands, since antibodies against the 46-kDa protein are endocytosed normally (see Chapter VIII for more details on endocytosis). Thus, the 46-kDa protein seems to be specifically involved in the sorting of endogenous lysosomal enzymes.",

These cells may have a completely M6P-independent system for sorting lysosomal enzymes. All lysosomal membrane proteins are also devoid of M6P residues. Therefore, some lysosomal enzymes may have membrane-associated intermediates which are sorted to the lysosome together with authentic lysosomal membrane proteins. Barriocanal et al. (49) used immunocytochemistry to follow the fate of three lysosomal membrane proteins which they detected in lysosomes, the Golgi apparatus, and coated and uncoated vesicles in the region of the TGN. They found that oligosaccharide modifications were not required for lysosomal targeting (although they may be required to protect against proteolysis). Thus the sorting pathway for these proteins remains to be determined; they could be sorted completely independently of lysosomal enzymes or could be colocalized to the same coated vesicles by an M6Pindependent receptor and then segregated from recycling vesicle mem brane components in the prelysosome. Green et al. (397) have recently found that newly synthesized lysosomal membrane proteins appear in lysosomes with the same kinetics as newly synthesized plasma membrane proteins appear at the cell surface, making it unlikely that the former pass via the plasma membrane en route to the lysosome.",

The second processing step is catalyzed by a vacuo lar protease, proteinase A, which removes an additional N-terminal poly peptide segment, the propeptide, from other vacuolar enzymes. Protein ase A is also autoactivated by the same mechanism (15,1206). The second processing step is blocked by certain sec mutations, which cause secre tory proteins to accumulate in the RER or Golgi apparatus, whereas mutations which affect the final stage of the secretory pathway from the Golgi to the cell surface do not affect vacuolar protein sorting or process ing (1082).

These observations led to the development of tech niques for selecting mutants which secreted CPY or CPY-invertase with out overproduction (Section II.F.l.b). Mutations in over 50 different genes (called VPL or VPT) have been identified (44,939a,971) . The extent of the sorting defect varied in different mutants: Some of them, for exam ple, did not affect the targeting of proteinase A, and none of them affected the sorting of the vacuolar membrane protein \u03b1-mannosidase, which is presumably sorted to the vacuole by an alternate pathway (971). It is unlikely that any of the mutations affected protein retention in the vacuole because vacuolar enzymes were not terminally processed, and the kinet ics of CPY secretion were comparable to those of a normally secreted protein. The characterization of the VPT or VPL gene products and their localization in the cell could provide revealing insights into the mecha nisms of vacuolar protein targeting, but at present we can only speculate on their roles. Obvious candidates are the propeptide receptor, vacuolar or Golgi ATPases which might produce a low pH environment necessary for sorting or receptor dissociation, or proteins involved in vesicle fission and fusion. Much less work has been done on plant vacuolar proteins. Tague and Chrispeels (1100) found that the plant vacuolar storage protein phytohemagglutinin was targeted mainly to the vacuole when its structural gene was expressed in yeast cells. This protein does not have a cleavable propeptide (it does have a signal peptide, which was at least partially processed in yeast cells), which means that the vacuolar plant sorting signal which is recognized by the yeast vacuolar sorting pathway is lo cated in the mature part of the phytohemagglutinin polypeptide. mRNA coding for a second plant storage protein, globulin P, has been microinjected into frog oocytes, which secreted the protein into the medium (51). This confirms that plant vacuolar proteins are bona fide secretory proteins and that plant cells have a special branch of the secretory pathway which shunts storage proteins into vacuoles.",

This may explain, for example, the disappearance of the clathrin coat from matur ing secretory granules (Section V.G.4.b) and the presence of lysosomal protein precursors in naked as well as coated vesicles. Vesicles coated with other proteins are also presumably uncoated to allow fusion to oc cur. The uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles is mediated by the ATPdependent cytosolic \"uncoating\" protein, which remains attached to the released clathrin (1010). Soluble clathrin retains its typical triskelion con formation. Uncoating protein is a member of a highly conserved group of stress proteins and may be related to HSP70 heat shock proteins involved in other stages in secretory protein transport and in mitochondrial protein import (Sections III.C.3 and VLB.5). The significance of this observation remains to be determined (855,967), but one possibility is that the ATPase (HSP70) is required to activate an uncoating enzyme which is already present in the clathrin complex.",

Yeasts are known to have clathrin, and coated vesicles have been observed, but it is not known whether clathrin coats vesicles involved in secretory protein targeting (1165). The gene for the clathrin heavy chain was independently cloned by two groups who used it to inactivate the chromosomal gene to study the effect of the absence of clathrin on cell growth and protein secretion. Payne and Schekman (852) and Payne et al. (853,853a) reported that their mutants grew somewhat more slowly than wild-type cells, secreted invertase at a slightly reduced rate, and were partially defective in prepro-a-factor pro-cessing. The mutants accumulated unusual vacuoles, vesicles, and Golgiderived structures. These results suggested that the absence of clathrin did not completely impair plasma membrane growth and protein secretion but that there was nevertheless a reduced rate of transit of secretory proteins through the later stages of the secretory pathway. Different results were obtained using exactly the same approach by Lemmon and Jones (627). They found that cells lacking the clathrin heavy chain were not viable unless they also carried a suppressor mutation. Even with this mutation, the cells grew slowly, were larger and rounder, had an unusual granular appearance, tended to aggregate in liquid culture, and were poly ploid. These results suggest that the absence of clathrin is highly detri mental to yeast cells, making it difficult to determine whether clathrin plays a specific role in protein secretion in this organism.",

            "text": "The secretory pathway is almost certainly the route by which the vast majority of secreted and plasma membrane proteins are exported by eukaryotic cells. However, there is increasing evidence that some plasma membrane and secretory organelle proteins may reach their final destina tions directly rather than via the secretory pathway. Examples of this class of proteins include RAS-like GTP binding proteins such as SEC4 (987) and RAS2 (232) of the yeast S. cerevisiae and similar proteins from complex eukaryotes (1194), mating pheromones in yeast and some fungi (726, 886, 983) , capsid proteins of picornaviruses (851), and src proteins of Rous sarcoma and other transducing viruses (1029). Most if not all of these proteins are fatty acylated. Two different amino acids seem to be modified: N-terminal glycines, which are substrates for myristoyl CoA protein 7V-myristoyltransferase (1124), and C-terminal cysteines in RASlike proteins (232). These Cys residues are reported to be palmitoylated, but a farnecyl residue has been found in basidiomycete pheromones (983). The absence of the fatty-acylated amino acid disrupts membrane associa tion of RAS and src proteins (232, 555, 1029, 1194) , indicating that fatty acids probably anchor these proteins in their respective membranes. It remains to be determined how fatty-acylated proteins actually cross the plasma membrane (as in the case of the fungal pheromones) or what determines their specificity for certain membranes. A further example of a secreted protein which does not have a secretory routing signal is interleukin 1, but very little appears to be known about how this protein crosses the plasma membrane.",

At present, we have no clear idea of the extent to which the sorting vesicles have different membrane contents, but it seems probable that specific groups of membrane proteins (lysosomal, secretory granule, apical, and basolateral) accumulate at different sites in the membrane of the TGN from which sorting vesicles bud.

GTP binding proteins are also known to be involved in the generation of other intracellular signals, such as the activation or inactivation of adeny late cyclase, the activation of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, and the control of phospholipase C action (769).

Examples of endogenous apical proteins include a secreted 81-kDa glyco protein (390), an 80-kDa sulfated glycoprotein (1135), and degradative enzymes, including aminopeptidase \u039d and alkaline phosphatase, secreted by intestinal epithelial cells",
