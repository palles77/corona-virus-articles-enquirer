The targets selected for the assay were the sequences encoding the nucleocapsid protein of CAL and the G1 glycoprotein of CVV. Conserved regions were selected by aligning genetic sequences from various strains available in the GenBank database. Primers and probes were selected in conserved regions. The assay sensitivity was 75 gene copies (gc)/reaction for CAL serogroup viruses and 30 gc/reaction for CVV. The performance of the assay was linear over at least 6 log 10 gc. The assay was specific, given that it did not cross-react with a variety of pathogens. It did, however, detect 11 viruses within the CAL serogroup and 12 CVV isolates. The use of an internal control ensured that possible inefficiency in nucleic acid extraction or PCR inhibition would be detected.",

Before 2002, members of the CAL serogroup, LACV in particular, constituted the leading cause of arboviral encephalitis in the United States (Romero and Newland, 2006) . The most pathogenic member, and the most common cause of reported illness in this group, remains LACV. Children are particularly susceptible to La Crosse encephalitis (Balkhy and Schreiber, 2000; Romero and Newland, 2006) . The majority of LACV infections are subclinical or lead to mild symptoms. More serious cases result in encephalitis with symptoms of severe bifrontal headache, fever, vomiting, and lethargy progressing to seizures and coma (Balkhy and Schreiber, 2000; McJunkin et al., 1997 McJunkin et al., , 2001 . Symptoms of fever, focal seizures, and lateralizing epileptiform discharges can cause a misdiagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis (McJunkin et al., 2001) . TAHV and INKV viruses, in general, result in fever and in severe cases, CNS involvement can also occur (Demikhov et al., 1991) . JCV affects mainly adults and causes a febrile illness and mild CNS disease (Srihongse et al., 1984) . CVV is associated with encephalitis and meningitis in humans, but reported cases are rare (Campbell et al., 2006; Sexton et al., 1997) . Preliminary evidence suggests that CVV can cause congenital defects in humans, but this assertion needs to be further investigated (Calisher and Sever, 1995) . CVV is the causal agent of congenital malformations and fetal death in sheep (Chung et al., 1990; Edwards, 1994) and has also been found to infect cattle, horses, and white-tailed deer (Blackmore and Grimstad, 1998; McLean et al., 1987) . The transmission cycle of CVV includes small mammals, such as rabbits and mosquitoes. The virus has been isolated from multiple species of anopheline or culicine mosquitoes, including Anopheles quadrimaculatus and Culiseta inornata (Calisher et al., 1986a) .",

We performed the duplex real-time RT-PCR assay on extracted RNA from each strain to determine whether nucleic acid from all 11 strains would be successfully amplified by the real-time RT-PCR reaction. Results showed that all strains were detected and amplified. In addition, nucleic acid was extracted from each of 12 isolates of amplified CVV (Table 3 ) and then tested in the duplex realtime RT-PCR assay. All isolates were detected and amplified.",

Similarly, a range of virus culture concentrations that included high (6.5 \u00d7 10 4 gc/250-\u03bcL CSF, equivalent to 5.9 \u00d7 10 3 gc/reaction), medium (6.5 \u00d7 10 3 gc/250-\u03bcL CSF, equivalent to 5.9 \u00d7 10 2 gc/reaction), and low (6.5 \u00d7 10 2 gc/250-\u03bcL CSF, equivalent to 59 gc/reaction) concentrations were selected for the CVV strain 62-7364. These dilutions of virus were then spiked into CSF that had previously tested negative for CAL serogroup viruses and CVV. Forty negative samples were either not spiked or else spiked with 1 of 3 concentrations of LACV and CVV in various combinations (Table 4 ). In addition to these samples, 1 negative extraction control was included in each extraction run. All 40 blinded samples and negative controls were also spiked with a known amount of GFP RNA transcript (2200 The high, medium, and low spikes for LACV were 5.1 \u00d7 10 3 , 5.1 \u00d7 10 2 , and 51 gc/reaction, respectively; the high, medium, and low spikes for CVV were 5.9 \u00d7 10 3 , 5.9 \u00d7 10 2 , and 59 gc/reaction, respectively.

RNA was extracted from the specimens using the NucliSens easyMAG system. GFP was then detected in the sample via real-time RT-PCR to determine extraction efficiency and the presence of inhibitors (Table 4) . There was minimal loss in sensitivity after nucleic acid extraction, as evidenced by detection of all blinded high, medium, and low gene copy spikes in CSF samples ( Table  4 ). The negative extraction controls had Ct values of N45, indicating that cross-contamination had not occurred during extraction of any of the samples; consequently, no false positives were detected. In addition, all real-time RT-PCR experiments included positive LACV (300 gc/reaction) and CVV (1000 gc/reaction) controls, which gave Ct values within the respective acceptable ranges (31-34 and 29-32). The Ct values for GFP for all of the samples were also within the acceptable range (35) (36) (37) (38) . In general, if the GFP Ct value of a clinical specimen exceeds the acceptable range, the recommendation would be to repeat the extraction and realtime RT-PCR.",

Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs), hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests, and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent (MAC-ELISA) assays have been used in the diagnosis of bunyaviruses (Calisher et al., 1986b; Grimstad et al., 1986; McJunkin et al., 1998) . The disadvantages of these tests are that PRNT is time consuming and cumbersome, HI is not sensitive, and MAC-ELISA may not be sufficiently specific to determine the infecting serotype (Calisher, 1994; Calisher et al., 1986b) . In addition, IgM antibodies appear to persist. For example, serum IgM antibodies to LACV remain elevated N9 months after infection; therefore, detection of IgM in a single serum sample from an individual who lives in an endemic area is not indicative of recent infection (Calisher et al., 1986b; Tsai, 1991) . Virus isolation from CSF and brain tissue is difficult and time consuming and is, therefore, not routinely performed on specimens from patients diagnosed with viral encephalitis (Calisher, 1994; Romero and Newland, 2006) . Molecular detection by real-time RT-PCR is an ideal method for detection of CAL serogroup viruses and CVV in humans and other vertebrate hosts because it is rapid, sensitive, specific, reproducible, and amenable to automation. Various RT-PCR methods, the majority of which use conventional RT-PCR methodology, have been employed for the detection of these viruses (Campbell and Huang, 1995; Chandler et al., 1998; Grady and Campbell, 1989; Kuno et al., 1996; Huang et al., 2001; Lambert et al., 2005; Ngo et al., 2006; Wasieloski et al., 1994) .",

The targets for the PCR assay are sited within conserved regions of the genome, namely, sequences encoding the G1 glycoprotein of CVV and the N protein of CAL serogroup viruses. Although the assay is intended for patient CSF samples, it can also be used for vector surveillance. We found the optimal PCR kit for this assay to be the qScript One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Quanta Biosciences). The linear assay range is 75 to 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 gc/reaction for CAL serogroup (specifically LACV) and 30 to 2.7 \u00d7 10 7 gc/reaction for CVV. The sensitivity of the assay is 75 gc/ reaction for LACV and 30 gc/reaction for CVV. The assay is specific in that the primers and probes did not cross-react with any of the organisms in the specificity panel that we used. The assay detected 11 different viruses representative of the 3 complexes of CAL serogroup viruses and also the 12 different isolates of CVV that we tested (Tables 2 and 3) .",

The assay correctly identified the CAL serogroup or CVV genome present in the specimen, regardless of the concentration of virus that was spiked. Moreover, although many of the spiked samples had both viruses present, in some cases at high concentrations, detection of both viral genomes occurred just as efficiently as if there was no competitor virus present (Table 4 ), indicating that neither assay was inhibited. Furthermore, both detection assays, as well as the internal control assay, showed minimal variability, as demonstrated by the low CV values when the assay was performed multiple times (Table 4 ).",

The assay has a turnaround time of less than 5 h (including the nucleic acid extraction step) and is, therefore, rapid. Our data show that it is a highly specific, reproducible, and sensitive assay for detecting CAL serogroup virus RNA and CVV RNA in patient samples, and the multiplexed nature of the assay makes it cost-effective and especially suitable when sample volume is limited. In addition, the assay can be used in highthroughput screening for surveillance studies.",
