However, classical PEDV vaccine strains only provide limited protection against emerging strains. In this study, we successfully isolated and attenuated the PEDV epidemic strain Zhejiang08, which was characterized by good cell adaptation and high-titer production 48 h post infection in Vero E6 cells. The attenuated virus induced a high level of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies until 120 days after immunization in piglets and provided complete protection when challenged with an emerging virus strain on day 14 post immunization. Moreover, the capability to activate dendritic cells (DCs) of this isolate was identified. Higher expression levels of IL-12 and IFN-c were recorded in DCs after treatment with Zhejiang08 for 24 h. Furthermore, genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed high homology between the main antigen epitopes of Zhejiang08 and PEDV pandemic isolates following 2011. Combining the glycosylation site prediction results and their distribution within the spatial structure of the S protein, led to the conclusion that the observed more effective host immune response of Zhejiang08 compared to CV777 was possibly associated with a lack of the potential glycosylation site in the 296 amino acids of the S protein. In summary, we illustrated that the attenuated virus represents a promising vaccine candidate.",

Many classical PEDV live vaccines, including CV777, Japan 83P-5, and Korea DR13 strains (all without pathogenicity), induced robust immune responses in sows and succeeded to control classical PEDV infections in pig farms for three decades [4] [5] [6] . CV777 for example was isolated from pigs during a PED outbreak in Belgium in 1976 and the attenuated vaccine strain was prepared via serial passaging of the strain in cell cultures. This strain has been widely used in Asian countries, where it provided effective immunological protection in herds for almost two decades [7, 8] . However, these traditional attenuated PEDV vaccines typically displayed lower serum antibody titers against emerging PEDV strains after 2011, suggesting that classical PEDV vaccine strains may only provide partial cross-protection against highly virulent strains. The low immune protective efficiency was attributed to the remarkable antigenic variation of structure proteins and major antigen sites between classical and emerging PEDV isolates [2, 8] .",

Several viruses have been reported to utilize the cellular glycosylation pathway during both host cell invasion and immune evasion, including influenza, HIV, hepatitis, and the West Nile virus [9] [10] [11] [12] . The S protein of PEDV is one of the most glycosylated proteins in nature, and many of the glycosylation sites feature high mannose composition. During viral evolution, sites are easily added or deleted and the resulting potential modification diversity increases the complexity of viral glycoproteins [13] . DCs are widely distributed beneath both mucosal surfaces and dermal layers, which are the most powerful antigen-presenting cells within the intestine mucosal immune system [14] . DCmediated modulation of immune responses is highly dependent on the maturation status of DCs after encountering an exogenous microorganism [15] . Therefore, the capacity of the vaccine to stimulate the maturation of DCs and induce T-cell responses has also been an important criterion for vaccine evaluation [16] .",

All piglets were randomly assigned to three groups (Control, CV777, and Zhejiang08), were artificially fed with milk, and housed in three separate rooms. Three groups were intramuscularly immunized with 1 mL of CV777 (10 5.0 TCID50/mL), 1 mL of Zhe-jiang08 (10 5.0 TCID50/mL), and the same volume of saline, respectively, all of which were emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. Subsequent to immunization, sera samples from piglets of the three different groups were collected at 7 d until 150 d after immunization to explore whether piglets generated PEDV neutralizing antibodies as previously described [19] . On the 14th day after immunization, 18 piglets were chosen, and assigned to groups with six piglets per group. These piglets were divided according to their original group, and each group was housed in a separate room. Then, the piglets of all groups were orally challenged with 1 ml 10 3 MID/ml of PEDV fourth-generation tissue virulent virus (intestinal tissue from virulent PEDV infected piglets).

Furthermore, such pathological changes were not observed during the examination of Zhejiang08 treatment group samples. A large amount of immunofluorescence-stained PEDV positive cells was detected in the jejunum of diarrhea piglets from both PBS and CV777 treatment groups. PEDV antigens were mainly observed in the cytoplasm of villi epithelial cells (Fig. 4C) . and COE aa sequence of the S protein (C). Phylogenetic analysis was performed, utilizing the neighbor-joining method and bootstrapping for 1000 replicates with a value >70%, to determine the percentage reliability of each internal node. The sequence of the Zhejiang08 strain was indicated by a red circle. The distribution charts of glycosites were colored according to the potential score of the N-Glyc prediction result, green (+), red (++), and blue (+++) color represent ''Potential > 0.5\", ''Potential > 0.5 AND Jury agreement (9/9) OR Potential > 0.75\", and ''Potential > 0.75 AND Jury agreement\", respectively. Any potential crossing of the default threshold of 0.5 represents a predicted glycosylation site (as long as it occurred within the required sequon Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr without Proline at Xaa).

Immature DCs that had been stimulated with LPS for 24 h typically expressed a DC-like morphology, including a significantly larger cell body and irregular shape (Fig. 5A right) . Flow cytometry analysis revealed that Zhejiang08 uptake by DCs was higher compared to that of the CV777 group (Fig. 5B) . Then, we assessed the phenotypic maturation marker of DCs via flow cytometry. Expressions of CD1a, SWC3a, and CD86 were remarkably upregulated in the Zhejiang08 group compared to both CV777 and control (Fig. 5C ). Mixed leukocyte reaction was used to determine whether the ability of PEDV-treated DCs to stimulate T-cell proliferation had been influenced in vitro. Our study revealed that Zhejiang08-treated DCs had a stronger ability to activate T-cells at a DC/T cell ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 5D ). In addition, our results showed that DCs treated with Zhejiang08 had significant levels of mRNA expression of IL-12 and IFN-c compared to both the CV777 and the control group, while no change could be detected in IL-10 secretion (Fig. 5E) .

IL-12 plays an important role in the differentiation of naive CD4 + T-cells into IFN-c-producing TH1-type cells. IFN-c helps to direct the immune response and to regulate the immune network, causing an antiviral effect [26] [27] [28] . Furthermore, Zhejiang08 treated DCs also exhibited a stronger stimulating effect on T lymphocyte cells.

            "text": "As the most important post-translational modification of the PEDV spike protein, the main feature of N-linked glycosylation was the attachment of a high mannose core to the amide nitrogen of asparagine in the context of the conserved Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif [13] . Via comparison and analysis of the NetNGlyc predicted results of the S protein and compared to Zhejiang08, we found that three and one additional glycosylation sites may have formed in the S proteins of AH2012 and CV777, respectively. Our results revealed that glycan has the ability to form a barrier, thus shielding the antigen of a potential virus and neutralizing epitopes, and influencing the identification and immune response of downstream elements [9] . To further analyze the potential influence on the immunogenicity of the S protein by glycosylation sites, we compared the spatial position of n-glycosylation sites via the homology modeling method. However, to our surprise, we found that two extra aa n-glycosylation sites ASN300 and ASN381 completely covered the sequence between positions 249 and 529 of the AH2012 S protein. Furthermore, the site ASN296 in the S protein of CV777 also proved to be partially hidden in this region. A previous study has reported a potential porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) binding site in this region of the PEDV S protein [30] [31] [32] . It has been reported that PEDV uses porcine APN as its receptor, consequently enabling the virus to enter into host cells and to recognize immune cells, which is initiated via binding of the S protein to this cellular receptor [33] . Therefore, we suggest that the difference of the immune efficiency between CV777 and Zhejiang08 could partly be attributed to epitope exposure and cell binding, influenced by additional glycosylation sites. Moreover, in AH2012 and other highly virulent viruses that have emerged since 2011, the two additional glycosylation sites were likely acquired by selective pressure, thus providing a more complete shielding to this region, which may be associated with viral escape from the immune system. However, future studies could involve the generation of specific mutants, using reverse genetics to validate our suggestion.",
