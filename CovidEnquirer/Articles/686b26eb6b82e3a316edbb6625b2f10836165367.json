Unlike the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed models of disease transmission, our model exhibits both geographically localised outbreaks and \"super-spreaders\". Moreover, the combination of localised and long range links allows for more accurate modelling of partial isolation and various public health policies. From this model, we derive an expression for the probability of a widespread outbreak and a condition to ensure that the epidemic is controlled. Moreover, multiple simulations are used to make predictions of the likelihood of various eventual scenarios for fixed initial conditions. The main conclusions of this study are: (i) \"super-spreaders\" may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant; (ii) consistent with previous reports, extended exposure time beyond 3-5 days (i.e. significant nosocomial transmission) was the key factor in the severity of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong; and, (iii) the spread of SARS can be effectively controlled by either limiting long range links (imposing a partial quarantine) or enforcing rapid hospitalisation and isolation of symptomatic individuals. .hk (M.

In addition, the epidemiological data currently available for Hong Kong is far superior to that of the Chinese mainland. 1 Two characteristic features were observed during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 (see Fig. 1 ) [3, 4] : so-called super-spread events (SSE), in which a single individual initiates a large number of cases; and persistent transmission within the community. Two widely cited SSEs were observed early in the epidemic and have been the subject of much attention: at the Amoy Gardens housing estate and at the Prince of Wales hospital.

An alternative approach [8] , particularly popular for the study of sexually transmitted diseases [9] [10] [11] , is to build an explicit network and model disease transmission along the links. Under certain network structures, it is then possible to obtain a closed form study of the underlying transmission pattern [10, 12] .

The important feature of both SW and SF networks is that they are highly connected: the average path length between random individuals is relatively short. Moreover, for SF networks, the node degree distribution follows a scale-free distribution. Hence, in many areas of natural and physical science, this new model structure has unveiled a rich range of behaviours. In this paper, we apply these methods to the modelling of the spread of SARS in Hong Kong; transmission is only allowed to occur along a limited number of direct links between individuals. By doing this, we will avoid making one of the assumptions underlying standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models: a homogeneous fully connected population. The SIR model assumes that all individuals are susceptible to the disease and all suffer an equal, small, positive probability of contracting the virus. This homogeneous model leads to a continuous and smooth inter-day distribution of infections. Irregularities in this are usually attributed to random variation and non-stationarity in the model parameters.",

While it is impossible to predict the occurrence of such outbreaks, SW-SF models provide a more realistic physical model of the relationships between individuals in a community and will therefore provide a better picture of the true disease dynamics. Note that, since one cannot actually predict when a particular SSE will occur, one cannot accurately model the timing of the peak in the time series of Fig. 1 . Moreover, it is not possible to accurately model the initial SSE at the Prince of Wales hospital, which \"kick started\" the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong.

Individuals can be susceptible (S), prone (P), infected (I), or removed (R). The transmission path is depicted in Fig. 2 . Infected individuals can cause susceptible individuals, to whom they are linked, to become prone with some probability ( p 1 or p 2 ). By infection we mean the transition from the susceptible state to the prone state. Infected individuals can cause their immediate neighbours to become infected with probability p 1 ; long range links cause infection with probability p 2 . Prone individuals become infected with probability r 0 and, finally, infected individuals become removed with probability r 1 . Just as in the SIR model, we do not distinguish fatalities from recoveries: in either case, the individuals are assumed to have acquired immunity. The model states that we describe here bear a close correspondence to the four states of the SEIR model. The prone state is analogous to the exposed (E) state in the SEIR model. We choose to use the new term P because the epidemiological state is slightly different. By prone we mean both the infected but not infectious (incubation) period and the pre-symptomatic period. For SARS, all infections in Hong Kong could be traced to contact with a symptomatic individual. 2 Hence, for the purposes of modelling transmission, we assume that, during the pre-symptomatic period, there is no chance of transmission. Moreover, to calibrate our model with the observed data (which, by definition, are hospital admissions), we further prescribe that the time between the onset of symptoms and hospitalisation is constant (or, equivalently, follows a stationary unimodal distribution).",

So, by \"local\" transmission, we mean only transmission within a family unit (i.e. residents of a single flat), or between adjacent flats. 3 Hence, \"non-local\" transmission The top panel depicts the transmission state diagram: S to P based on the SW structure and the infection probabilities p 1,2 ; P to I with probability r 0 ; and I to R with probability r 1 .

The population of N nodes is arranged in a regular grid, of side length L (L 2 = N ), and each node is connected directly to n 1 immediate neighbours. 5 An infected individual will infect each of its n 1 neighbours (provided that they are still susceptible) with probability p 1 . Furthermore, each node has n 2 non-local (i.e. long distance) links (see Fig. 2 ). These are links to nodes that are geographically remote from one another; infection occurs along these pathways with probability p 2 . For each node i, the number n (i) 2 is fixed, and so are the links to its n (i) 2 remote neighbours once they are established.

One can therefore observe that P safe \u2248 0 if p 1 \u2248 1 or n 1 1. The most severe limitation on Eq. (5), and also Eqs. (7) and (8) , is that we assume that no infected nodes have common neighbours, and that all of the neighbours are susceptible. In reality, the number of potential infections is limited by the fact that some of the potential neighbours are already infected. It is therefore important to estimate the number of neighbours of an infected node that have not been infected. This is equivalent to estimating the ratio of local and non-local infections in an epidemic. 8 One can consider the network of infected individuals as consisting of a number of \"clumps\": one clump 7 Because of the assumption that infections occur individually and sequentially, the branching process in Eq. (5) is only an approximation to the solution of Eq. (8). 8 We can achieve this as follows. Suppose that there are no non-local infections (i.e. p 2 = 0) and that infections grow in a single (roughly spherical) \"clump\". Then, if the clump consists of I (t) individuals, then the radius of this for each non-local infection (i.e. each clump is seeded by a nonlocal transmission; all other transmissions within that clump are local). Provided p 2 > 0, this implies that, as the clump gets bigger, the probability of any given infection being a long range infection will increase. Conversely, as the number of clumps increases, the probability of local infection (relative to nonlocal infection) will increase. 9 Let us now estimate the expected number of connections from an infected node. Let N S denote the expected number of susceptible nodes linked to a random node. If this node is the result of a non-local infection, then we suppose that N S = n 1 + \u00b5; however, if this is the result of a short range infection, then this number should be lower (certainly no more than \u00b5 + n 1 \u2212 1).

Consistent with the discussion of the preceding section, we start with the assumption that k = n 1 \u22121 n 1 and set n 1 = 4 and \u00b5 = 7. Fig. 3 is a plot of the probability of complete infection for various parameter values estimated from the data and Eq. (5). We see that there is close agreement between the theoretical and experimental results. Moreover, we note that a smaller value of k is appropriate for scenarios with a relatively high proportion of local spreading (i.e. p 1 larger and p 2 \u2248 0). This is consistent with the case of spreading within a single clump, and we approach the situation of k = 1 2 . However, in these simulations the best choice is k > 1 2 in all cases. Only for extremely small values of r 1 and p 2 would we expect smaller values of k. Typically, k = n 1 \u22121 n 1 = 3 4 seems to be a good choice. Furthermore, in Fig. 3 it is evident that the greatest probability of an epidemic becoming endemic is when there is both local and non-local infection. In the model that we have constructed here, local infection spreads approximately geometrically, 11 while non-local infection spreads exponentially. Yet, it is some combination of both that provided the greatest possibility of an outbreak spreading without control. Clearly, exponential growth will lead (all else being equal) to more rapid growth of an epidemic than geometric growth. But, by combining some geometric growth, the epidemic becomes even more dangerous. It seems that the additional local transmissions allow each nonlocal transmission the possibility of seeding a new infection cluster (rather than just a single point), and each new cluster is more difficult to eradicate than a single point infection. Fig. 4 depicts level curves for the probability of fixed levels of infection. That is, we compute the parameter values p 1,2 \u2208 [0, 1] and r 1 \u2208 [0.1, 0.5] required to achieve specific values of P safe . We see that only for p 1,2 0.2 is the outbreak likely to be controlled. Moreover, the variation with r 1 is not critical i.e. the range of behaviour for specific p 1,2 is not great.",

Apart from deriving analytic expression for the spreading and control of an epidemic, the main results of this study, when applied to the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003, is that our data is consistent with the observation that the epidemic that occurred was largely preventable. The primary factor for the severity of the outbreak was poor infection control in the hospital setting and the delayed introduction of quarantine and community isolation practices. This is consistent with various discussions presented elsewhere. However, we note that nosocomial transmission was considered only by supposing (admittedly erroneously) that the time between becoming symptomatic (and infectious) and hospitalisation is constant. Nosocomial transmission is simulated by changing the expected duration between becoming symptomatic (I) and becoming removed (R). Although this is perhaps unconventional from an epidemiological viewpoint, it is probably the best that we can do, as the only data that we have to work from is the date of hospital admission. This conclusion is in contrast with work done by Pastor-Satorras and colleagues [20, 21] with scale-free SIS type [7] disease models.

Doing so would produce simulations with a larger number of highly connected individuals, and therefore we could simulate the largest SSEs in the data.

Certainly, we cannot exclude the (quite likely) probability that other parameter values also produce behaviour of which the observed data is typical. Therefore, in this paper we only draw conclusions based on our observations of parameters that produce behaviours that are either typical or (more importantly) atypical of the observed data.

Given an average infectious period of four days (prior to hospitalisation), this implies that the daily probability of transmission is 0.02. This is approximately consistent with the values of p 1 used in this study, and therefore provides further support of our results.",

As this study dealt with a single meeting, this implies a daily infection probability of approximately 0.371: significantly higher than p 2 in our simulations. Hence, although we have concluded that SSEs may occur without individuals necessarily being highly infectious, epidemiological evidence suggests that, in some cases, this may still be the case.",

Apart from repeating, or modifying, this analysis for different infectious diseases (such as HIV AIDS), we imagine that these techniques could be useful in the theoretical study of quarantine and isolation practices, as well as disease transmission among isolated communities. Quarantine can be effectively modelled as a limitation of long range transmission. One can easily model change in quarantine by varying the parameter \u00b5 (or alternatively, but not equivalently, p 2 ). This should provide a new, simpler approach to the study of quarantine to supplement compartmental models such as those described in [25] .",
