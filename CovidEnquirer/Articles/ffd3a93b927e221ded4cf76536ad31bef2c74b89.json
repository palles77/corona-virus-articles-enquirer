Our fi ndings support recent studies showing that HRV may be associated with severe respiratory tract infection in infants and children (4) (5) (6) . A study in central Vietnam also showed that HRV is a notable cause of ARI in children in Vietnam (7) . Because we detected rhinovirus in all hospitalized infants, we believe that HRV was the main causal agent in this outbreak, although 2 hospitalized infants were co-infected with RSV, an unambiguous respiratory pathogen. A deep lung specimen from 1 hospitalized infant was also positive for HRV, which supports a causal relationship. Furthermore, the outbreak orphanage had signifi cantly more HRV-positive patients than did the control orphanage, and sequence analysis showed that the outbreak isolates formed a distinct cluster, which also supports a causal role for HRV.",

HRV-C has been associated with more severe infections and circulates worldwide (3, (8) (9) (10) . We may have missed the HRV-C strains in the clinical case-patients, because we were only able to sequence the virus from samples from 2 patients. We had to sequence directly from the specimens because we had no viral culture facility at the time of the outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis of P1-P2 sequences can distinguish HRV-B rhinoviruses, but it is limited in distinguishing HRV-A and HRV-C. Full HRV sequence analysis would be able to provide this detail, but it was not feasible for this investigation.",

Only a small number of controls were selected from a single orphanage, and the controls were sampled later than the hospitalized patients and children from the outbreak orphanage. These limitations may have led to underdiagnosis of HRV in controls. Bacterial co-infection cannot be ruled out as a cause of more severe infection in the hospitalized infants because most were receiving antimicrobial drugs at the time respiratory specimens were collected. Viral respiratory infections can be more severe in malnourished infants, which was likely the case for the hospitalized infants in this outbreak. In this study, co-infections (16.4%) with other respiratory viruses were detected at a similar rate as in another study in central Vietnam (12.5%) (7) . This fi nding is also consistent with previous work indicating that HRV infections can occur with other respiratory viruses and lead to more severe disease (2, 7) . This outbreak illustrates that HRVs can cause severe pneumonia, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome in young, vulnerable infants. HRV remains an underappreciated cause of severe pneumonia in vulnerable groups.",
