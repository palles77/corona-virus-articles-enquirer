In order to overcome this limitation, uncommon alternative Ad serotypes need to be utilized. In this study, an E1-E3 deleted recombinant Ad based on the chimpanzee serotype 3 (ChAd3) was engineered to express human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) protein or rat neu extracellular/transmembrane domains (ECD.TM). ChAd3 vectors were tested in CEA transgenic (CEA.Tg) and BALB/NeuT mice, which show immunologic tolerance to these antigens. ChAd3 is capable of inducing an immune response comparable to that of hAd5 serotype-based vectors, thus breaking tolerance to tumor associated antigens (TAAs) and achieving anti-tumor effects. Of importance is that ChAd3 can overcome hAd5 pre-existing immunity and work in conjunction with DNA electroporation (DNA-EP) and other Ad vaccines based on common human serotypes.",

However, the high immunogenicity of E1-deleted Ad recombinants excluded their successful use for sustained gene therapy and led to their development as vaccine carriers [6] . Ad vaccines have been shown to induce the highest B-and CD8 + T-cell responses in experimental animals, including rodents [7, 8] , canines [9] , and primates [10] [11] [12] and have been tested in human clinical trials for antigens of HIV-1 [13] .

These include the inability to transduce certain target cell populations, an acute Ad mediated toxicity in vivo, and most importantly the high prevalence of hAd5 vector neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) within the human population which decrease gene trans-fer efficiency or blunt vaccine potency. In fact, subgroup C (which includes hAd2 and hAd5) adenoviral infection is endemic in the human population and consequently, the majority of humans seroconvert within the first 5 years of life as the result of natural infections. In the United States, depending on the age of the study population and the sensitivity of the assay, 40-60% of humans carry readily detectable VNAs to hAd5 virus [8] . Seroprevalence rates to hAd5 virus are markedly higher in human populations from developing countries [8] . In animal models, including non-human primates (NHPs), VNAs generated upon pre-exposure to hAd5 virus have been shown previously to strongly impair the B-and T-cell responses to the transgene product of a vaccine based on an E1deleted Ad of the same serotype [15] [16] [17] . A similar impairment was observed in human volunteers in a clinical trial with a hAd5 vaccine to HIV-1 [18] .",

These include immunosuppression [19, 20] , artificial envelopment with lipid bilayers [21] , use of different human Ad serotypes [22, 23] , retargeting of human vectors by masking the adenoviral fiber knob to ablate binding to the coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (CAR) [24] , targeting specific cell receptor by genetic modification of hAd fiber [25, 26] and vector encapsulation into microparticles [27] . Vectors based on human non-subgroup C adenovirus have been previously reported [22] . Among them, hAd35 has been proposed as an alternative to hAd5 for vaccine delivery because of its low seroprevalence: comparison of hAd5-and hAd35based vectors in mice and non-human primates showed a lower immunological potency of the latter vector [28, 29] . Similarly, two other vectors based on the rare serotypes hAd24 and hAd34 induced lower CMI than hAd5 in non-human primates [30] . Additionally, use of non-human Ads as vectors to elude hAd immunity has been proposed (reviewed in [31] ). Several non-human Ads are naturally non-pathogenic to humans and have been well characterized and unlike human Ads, it is expected that immunity to non-human adenoviruses will not be prevalent in the human population. It has been shown that pre-existing humoral immunity in humans did not cross-neutralize ovine [32] , chimpanzee [33] [34] [35] [36] , canine [37, 38] or porcine Ads [39] .",

In fact, one of the major obstacles to achieving a tumor-specific immune response is that of overcoming central and/or peripheral T cell tolerance against TAAs and inducing CTLs that could effectively eradicate disseminated tumor metastases and subsequently maintain a long lasting immunological memory, preventing tumor recurrence [40] . Ad have been shown to be efficacious vaccine vectors able to break immune tolerance to target antigens in human TAA transgenic mice [41] [42] [43] [44] as well as in nonhuman primates [45] . Increasingly, combinations of Ad vectors with heterologous modalities of immunization, such as in vivo electroporation of plasmid DNA (DNA-EP) induce superior immune responses compared to single modality vaccines [41, 45, 46] .",

Forni (University of Torino, Italy). For all experiments, mice were anaesthesized with Isoflurane (Schering Plough, New Augusta, USA) and immunized by injecting the indicated vp of hAd5 or ChAd3 vectors in quadriceps muscle. CEA.Tg mice were vaccinated with DNA by injecting a total amount of 50 g of pV1J-CEA-LTB plasmid DNA into one quadriceps muscle (50 g in 50 l of physiological solution) followed by electroporation (EP) as previously described [44] . At the end of the treatment period and before necropsy, mice were euthanized by compressed CO 2 gas in cylinder as indicated in the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Panel on Euthanasia and according to the guidelines described in [52] . The experiments were conducted according to EU Directive EC86/609 on the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes, which was ratified by Italian Legislation with DL no. 116/92 on 19 February, 1992",

Two weeks prior to the vaccination, mice were injected with 10 10 particles of wild type hAd5 to induce neutralizing antibodies. Following administration of the vaccine, the T-cell response was analyzed. Mice that received hAd5 wild type prior to hAd5 neu.ECD.TM showed no detectable neu-specific T cell response by IFN\u2425 intracellular staining (Fig. 5A) . The mean response dropped from 1% to undetectable, suggesting that the vector had been neutralized by pre-existing anti-hAd5 humoral responses. In contrast, no such significant drop in immunogenicity was observed in the ChAd3 neu.ECD.TM immunized mice. 50-70% of the mice were responders at both time points. Similar results were obtained for antibody response against rat HER2-neu, also strongly affected by pre-exposure to wt hAd5.",

Group average with standard deviations (error bar) is shown. (B) Vaccine potency of ChAd3-CEA. Groups of 6 CEA.Tg mice were vaccinated with the indicated vp of either hAd5-CEA or ChAd3-CEA vector. Thirty days after the injection, PBMCs were analyzed for CEA-specific response by intracellular staining for IFN\u2425. Histograms and error bars show group average and standard deviations, respectively. (C) hAd5 and ChAd3 vector mixed modality. Groups of 6",
