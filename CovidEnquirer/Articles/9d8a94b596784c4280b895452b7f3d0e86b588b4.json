            "text": "O ver the last 3 decades, Saudi Arabia has witnessed enormous progress in its socioeconomic condition that has resulted in prosperity and changes in lifestyle. 1 This, in turn, has decreased the prevalence of communicable diseases and increased the prevalence of non-communicable metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. 2 The Saudi Arabian population is relatively young. Several factors increase the risk of metabolic and chronic diseases in the Saudi Arabian population. 2 Cardiovascular ailments are at the top of the list of diseases causing highest number of mortality in Saudi Arabia. 3 Among this, ischemic heart disease accounts for 14% and stroke accounts for 11% of the total casualties in 2010. 3 Saudi Arabia provides free health-care services to its citizens. The government of Saudi Arabia in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized on improving the health situation in the country by focusing on 5 key health issues; namely, 1) health security and disease prevention, 2) control of communicable diseases, 3) control of non-communicable diseases, 4) accidents and injuries, and 5) strengthening of health systems, on a priority basis. 1 Cases of some infectious diseases were recently identified in Saudi Arabia, indicating that despite technological developments in diagnostics, treatment, and vaccination programs, various infectious diseases have re-emerged in Saudi Arabia after a decade. 4 For instance, the prevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection increased in Saudi Arabia during 2012, and this disease continues to be a concern during the summer season and religious congregations in holy sites. 5 Cancers are a major health concern globally. In Saudi Arabia, the incidence of the most common cancers has increased steadily, with colorectal cancer being the most common cancer among men and breast cancer being the most common cancer among women. [6] [7] [8] The scientific information available on the current status and trends of various communicable, non-communicable diseases and cancers are limited to the primary statistics available in the portals of Ministry of Health and other health agencies. However, studies on these publicly available data regarding its analysis to derive a conclusion regarding the trends of major disease in Saudi Arabia is scanty and scattered if existed. Hence, the present study was aimed at analyzing the trends in the incidence of 5 most common cancers, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases in Saudi Arabia over the last decade.",

The incidence rates (per 100,000 population) and trends in the ASR of hepatitis B, dengue fever, measles, chickenpox, and brucellosis for the period 2003-2016 are shown in Table 2 and (Table 3 and Figure 3A ). The prevalence of diabetes further increased to 34.7% among men and 28.6% among women in 2010-2017. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] The prevalence of HTN also increased from 11.4% to 28.6% in men and from 11.4% to 23.9% in women from 1970-1979 to 2000-2009 (Table 3 and Figure 3B ). 13, 16, 17 The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia (elevated serum cholesterol level) increased from 9% to 18.6% in men and from 11% to 19.7% in women during the same period (Table  3 and Figure 3C ). 11, 18 However, the prevalence of chronic pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis and emphysema decreased from 17.2% among both men and women in 1990-1999 to 5.8% in 2000-2009 and further decreased to 3.5% among men and 1.0% among women in 2010-2017 (Table 3 and Figure 3D ). [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] The prevalence of CAD was 6.6% in men and 4.4% in women. 19 The prevalence of obesity was increased from 22% in 1990-1993 to 36% in 2005 ( Figure 3E ). 20 The prevalence of obesity was 24.1% in males and 14% in females. 21 In Buraydah and Unaiza, the male obesity was found to be 34.3% and female obesity was 17.3%. 22 In Tabuk, male obesity was 18.1%. 23 The prevalence of obesity among Saudi children was found to be 9.3%. 24 In Jeddah, moderately obese was 10.7% and severely obese was 7.9%. 25 In Aseer, the prevalence of obesity was 23.2%. 26 Discussion. Saudi Arabia, with a population of 31.5 million people (in 2015), spends 7.25% of its 10 The present study assessed the trends in the incidence rate of 5 most common cancers, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases in Saudi Arabia. Our data showed that breast cancer was the most common cancer among Saudi Arabian women. This finding highlights the very low rate of breast cancer screening and the need to intensify breast cancer screening in Saudi Arabia. In the United States (US), literate women are more likely to undergo a mammography. 27 However, the rate of mammography is only 6.7% in Saudi Arabia compared with 72.4% in the US. 8, 28 Therefore, women empowerment is imperative for achieving the national goals of health education. Knowledge about breast cancer and its screening is still very poor among Saudi women. Therefore, awareness programs regarding the importance of breast cancer screening should be initiated more aggressively among Saudi Arabian women. The median age for colorectal cancer was 60 years for men and 55 years for women during 1994-2000 in Saudi Arabia and was 68 years for men and 72 years for women during 2004-2010 in the US. 7,29 Therfore, it is recommended to begin screening of colorectal cancer in Saudi Arabia at the age of 40 years and it may be strictly implemented. 28 The incidences of cancer in Saudi Arabia have reached a plateau recently, at least for colorectal cancer and the data supports this for the years 2010-2014. The increase in the number of reported cases of colorectal cancer in the last 5 years is merely due to an increase in the size of the population, but not an increase in the incidence rate which has fluctuated between 9-10/100,0000 and this is different from the rate in the 1990's.",

Increased incidence of thyroid cancer over the last decade may be attributed to its increased detection and diagnosis. 30 The mean age at diagnosis for thyroid cancer is 50 years in men and 42 years in women, which is significantly low. 31 The incidence of thyroid cancer is almost equal among individuals in the third, fourth, and fifth decades of life; however, this incidence differs according to gender, with most cases occurring in the third decade of life (20-30 years) in women and in the fifth decade of life (40-50 years) in men. 30 The increase in the incidence rate of overall cancer could be due to availability of better diagnostic tools now in Saudi Arabia compared to the early 1990's. Moreover, there is more robust registration of cancer cases compared to the past when the registry was launched and the experience was small in this vital field. Finally, Saudis live longer now, which explains the rise in cancer cases and chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. As the population ages and the infertility rate drops with more women joining the work force and with increased financial burden of the large families and higher education of the married couple; the younger age groups will make a less portion of the society. This will have an impact on the overall incidence rates of cancer and non-communicable diseases.",

These diseases can be successfully monitored and controlled by adopting effective supervision, research, and drug development strategies and by introducing counter measures such as surveillance, diagnosis, and effective affordable drugs and vaccines. Saudi Arabia has witnessed a steady decrease in the incidence of hepatitis B, measles, chickenpox, and brucellosis. In 1989-1990, Saudi Arabia introduced a highly effective hepatitis B vaccination program in schools, through which all Saudi Arabian individuals aged \u226434 years (as of 2017) were vaccinated at birth or at school. This has steadily decreased the incidence of hepatitis B in Saudi Arabia. Except for an unknown increase in the incidence of measles, a vaccine-preventable infectious disease, in 2007, there has been a decrease in the incidence of other communicable diseases in Saudi Arabia. Although the incidence of chickenpox was high before 2008, introduction of a varicella zoster vaccination program in 2008 drastically decreased the incidence of this viral infection to a minimal level, indicating a successful control of this virus in Saudi Arabia. The incidence of brucellosis has significantly decreased over the last decade; however, its incidence is noticeably high in Saudi Arabia compared with that in developed countries. Therefore, it is important to implement effective nationwide measures for controlling brucellosis. In contrast to the decreased incidence of major preventable infectious diseases, the incidence of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease, has increased in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabian tourists travelling to tropical destinations and infected immigrants from dengue fever endemic regions may have increased the dissemination of this contagious infection. Moreover, unavailability of effective vaccines against dengue fever hinders the nationwide measures for controlling this infection.",

Over the last decade, the incidence of diabetes has dramatically increased and was 34.7% among men and 28.6% among women during 2010-2017, indicating that one in every 3 individuals in Saudi Arabia is diabetic. Moreover, Saudi Arabia has one of the highest incidence rates of adult obesity worldwide. Data obtained from a previous study predicts an alarming increase in the incidence rate of obesity (men: 41.40%; women: 77.6%; overall: 59.5%) by 2022. 20 If left unchecked because of the absence of appropriate health education and policies, the incidence of diabetes and obesity in Saudi Arabia could increase to epidemic proportions, which may further lead to health issues such as micro-and macrovascular diabetes-associated complications, including cardiovascular diseases. The rapid increase in the prevalence of diabetes and obesity among the Saudi Arabian population may be attributed to distinct factors such as sedentary lifestyle with physical inactivity, irregular feeding habits, and intake of high-calorie foods and beverages. 30, 32 Therefore, a shift in attitude toward regular exercise, proper food habits, and physical activity in addition to appropriate health education from educational institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and corporates may be beneficial in ensuring better health of the Saudi Arabian population in the long run.",

Increased life expectancy and aging population increase the risk of chronic diseases. Although medical technology is enabling many people to cope with chronic diseases, its effects on the lives of elderly people are relevant when considered in terms of loss of life, disability, family hardship, poverty, and economic loss to the country. Therefore, increased emphasis should be given to the control and prevention of chronic diseases among the elderly population. However, lifestyle and behavioral patterns of the young generation are also changing rapidly, leading to the early onset of chronic diseases among the youth.",

The critical challenge for Saudi Arabia is to enhance its capacity for monitoring, preventing, and controlling non-communicable disease while maintaining and advancing the landmarks established in controlling communicable diseases (Figure 4 ). Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and stakeholder nations should continue their efforts toward the global prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. Such programs could reduce morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases and could improve the quality of life and economic condition of the affected individuals. 33 The key components of such programs are to promote awareness regarding the burden of non-communicable diseases, improve surveillance, train public health professionals, and increase healthcare capacity building at the national level by establishing feasible goals to prevent these diseases. This also includes the establishment of national health promotion programs and effective non-communicable disease prevention and control policies and programs.",
