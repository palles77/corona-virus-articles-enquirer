One is alignment-based methods, in which dynamic programming is used to find an optimal alignment by assigning scores to different possible alignments and picking the alignment with the highest score. Several alignment-based algorithms have been proposed such as global alignment, local alignment, with or without overlap (Gotoh, 1982; Needleman and Wunsch, 1970; Smith and Waterman, 1981; Randic, 2013a Randic, , 2013b . Waterman (Waterman, 1995) and Durbin et al. (Durbin et al., 1998) provided comprehensive reviews about this method. However, the search for optimal solutions using sequence alignment has problems in: (i) computationally load with large biological databases and (ii) choice of the scoring schemes (Pham and Zuegg, 2004; Vinga and Almeida, 2003) . Therefore, the emergence of research into the second class, alignment-free methods, is apparent and necessary to overcome critical limitations of alignment-based methods.",

One of the most widely used alignment-free approaches is statistical model, in which each sequence is first mapped into an m-dimensional vector according to its k-word frequencies, and sequence similarity can then be measured by distance measures, such as Euclidean distance (Blaisdell, 1986 ), Pearson's correlation coefficient (Fichant and Gautier, 1987) , Kullback-Leibler discrepancy (Wu et al., 2001) , Cosine distance (Stuart et al., 2002) among their corresponding vectors. Recently, Ewens and Grant (2005) studied probabilistic properties of words in sequences, deducted the exact distributions and evaluated its asymptotic approximations. When the k-words occurring in biological sequence are estimative probabilities rather than frequencies, they are more easily described by more complex models such as Markov model (Pham and Zuegg, 2004; Hao and Qi, 2004; Wu et al., 2006; Apostolico and Denas, 2008) , mixed model (Kantorovitz et al., 2007) and Bernoulli model (Lu et al., 2008) .",

In order to facilitate comparison of different biological sequences, they transformed graphical representations into some mathematical objects such as E matrix (Yao and Wang, 2004; Liao and Wang, 2004; Song and Tang, 2005) , D/D matrix (Li and Wang, 2003; Yao and Wang, 2004; Liao and Wang, 2004; Song and Tang, 2005) , L/L matrix (Randic et al., 2003; Li and Wang, 2003; Yao and Wang, 2004; Liao and Wang, 2004; Song and Tang, 2005) and their \"high order\" matrices (Yao and Wang, 2004; Song and Tang, 2005) . Once a matrix was given, they calculated matrix invariants as descriptors of the sequence, such as the average matrix element, the average row sum, the leading eigen value and the Wiener number.

Because it is based on exact direct repeats, the LZ complexity works well with the small DNA alphabet. Unlike DNA sequences, protein sequences and RNA secondary structures consist of more complex alphabets and structure information, which poses more of a challenge for LZ complexity. So Bacha and Baurain, Liu and Wang, Chen and Zhang presented several strategies in which protein sequences or RNA secondary structures were encoded to a new alphabet prior to computation of the LZ complexity (Bacha and Baurain, 2005; Liu and Wang, 2006; Zhang and Chen, 2010; Zhang and Wang, 2010; Chen and Zhang, 2012) . Zhang et al. found that the LZ complexity is strongly correlated with sequence length and proposed a normalized LZ complexity for sequence comparison (Zhang et al., 2009) . Taking into account a specific kind of the inexact copy in the text, Li et al. generalized the LZ complexity and proposed a new sequence distance measure for sequence comparison (Li et al., 2010) . Liu et al. introduced relative LZ complexity to depict the complexity relationship between two sequences (Liu et al., 2012) .",

In this paper, we used the proposed revised LZ complexity to obtain a series of LZ-words from the exhaustive history of biological sequences. Based on the LZ-word distributions, we constructed a sorted union LZ-word set from which an indicator sequence was obtained. We then calculated numerical characteristics of the indicator sequence to compare biological sequences. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by the phylogenetic analysis and comparison with alignment-based method.",

The name, accession number, abbreviation, and genome length for the 24 genomes are listed in Table 2 . Given a set of biological sequences, their phylogenetic relationship can be obtained through the following main operations: firstly, we construct the LZ-word set with revised Lempel-Ziv complexity and calculate the similarity/dissimilarity using operation measure; secondly, by arranging all the similarity/dissimilarity into a matrix, we obtain a pair-wise matrix; finally, we put the pair-wise distance matrix into the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) program in the PHYLIP package (Felsenstein, 1989) . Fig. 5(a) is phylogenetic tree of the 24 coronavirus genomes obtained using the proposed operation measure with SSM 5 . Generally, an independent method can be developed to evaluate the accuracy of a phylogenetic tree, or the validity of a phylogenetic tree can be tested by comparing it with authoritative ones. Here, we adopted the form one to test the validity of our phylogenetic tree. Both two data sets were aligned with the multiple alignment CLUSTAL X and constructed the phylogenetic tree presented in Fig. 5(b) . Fig. 5 (a) shows that our results are quite consistent with the authoritative results (Gu et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2005) and that of the multiple alignment Fig. 5 (b) in the following aspects. First of all, all SARS-CoVs are grouped in a separate branch, which appear different from the other three groups of coronaviruses. Secondly, BCOV, BCOVL, BCOVM, BCOVQ, MHV, MHV2, MHVM, and MHVP are grouped into a branch, which is consonant with the fact that they belong to group II. Thirdly, HCoV-229E, TGEV, and PEDV are closely related to each other, which is consistent with the fact that they belong to group I. Finally, IBV forms a distinct branch within the genus Coronavirus, because it belongs to group III. Rota et al. (Rota et al., 2003) found out that the overall level of similarity between SARS-CoVs and the other coronaviruses is low. Our tree also reconfirms that SARS-CoVs are not closely related to any previously isolated coronaviruses and form a new group, which indicates that the SARS-CoVs have undergone an independent evolution path after the divergence from the other coronaviruses.",

Instead of focusing on the total number of components in the exhaustive history, we analyzed the distribution of components themselves. Then we defined transition and extension operations among the revised LZ-word sets and represented them in the operation figure. With the length of operations in mind, we designed an operation measure to estimate the similarity/dissimilarity of two biological sequences. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, two sets of evaluation experiments were taken, and its performance was further compared with alignment-based methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient, which highlight the necessity for LZ-based method to consider the whole distribution of the components in the exhaustive history. Thus, this understanding can then be used to guide development of more powerful alignment-free for biological sequence comparison.",
