To this end, LAB strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (RV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) release as well as the attachment ability of LAB on the cell lines was investigated. Various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral RV or TGEV disruption. Highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus casei Shirota against both RV and TGEV, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to Enterococcus faecium PCK38, Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC179, Lactobacillus pentosus PCA227 and Lactobacillus plantarum PCA236 and PCS22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. A variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of NO \u2212 and H 2 O 2 (ROS) was obtained when LAB strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be LAB strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ROS release in more than one cell line. In contrast, the ability of the examined LAB strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was LAB strain but not cell line specific. Highest attachment ability was observed with L. plantarum ACA-DC 146, L. paracasei subsp. tolerans ACA-DC 4037 and E. faecium PCD71. Clear indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the L. casei Shirota against TGEV and with L. plantarum PCA236 againt both RV and TGEV. In the rest of the cases, each interaction was LAB-cell line-virus specific, barring general conclusions. However, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. Further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.",

Since the ban of antibiotic growth promoters in the European Union (E.U.) in (Regulation 1831 /EC, 2005 , probiotic animal feed supplementation has risen as a viable alternative to antibiotics, as reported for several monogastric or ruminant farm animals (Scharek et al., 2007; Pollmann et al., 2005; Stella et al., 2007; Maragkoudakis et al., submitted) . Probiotics (Fuller, 1989; Guarner and Shaafsma, 1998) are comprised primarily of lactic acid bacteria which form part of the normal enteric flora of man and animals. Probiotic feed supplementation may benefit the animal host directly, by preventing the infection and combating the causative agent of the intestinal disorder, or indirectly, by balancing the disrupted equilibrium of the enteric flora and augmenting the host's immune responses.",

TGEV belongs to the family of coronaviruses and can been encountered globally where intensive pork industry is practiced, causing great economic losses (Sestak and Saif, 2002) . RV on the other hand, a member of the Reoviridae family, is better known as being the leading cause of infant and young children diarrhea (Parashar et al., 2003) accounting for more than 500,000 deaths each year in children under five years (WHO epidemiological report, 2007) .

Although both of the known probiotics used in this study have been used extensively in the literature, few cases have been reported on their antiviral effects in animals (Zhang et al., 2008) and, to the best of our knowledge, none have been reported on cell lines. In fact, very few data exists in general on the use of probiotics as viral infection deterrents on cell lines. Recent studies (Boti\u0107 et al., 2007; Ivec et al., 2007) reported the protective effect that various lactic acid bacteria, including the probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei F19, conferred upon porcine intestinal epithelial and macrophage cell line infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). In the above studies, the antiviral effect mechanism was attributed to a variety of factors, including possible competition for attachment sites between probiotic bacteria and the virus and stimulation of innate cell responses or pro-inflammatory responses from the cell lines.",

To this end, we investigated the induction of reactive oxygen species NO \u2212 and H 2 O 2 release (ROS) by cell lines co-incubated with lactic acid bacteria. ROS has a variety of defensive roles in the host, such as killing of intracellular pathogens, tumor cells, but also virus-infected cells (Hibbs et al., 1998; Keyaerts et al., 2004) . The antiviral effects of NO \u2212 in particular have been previously reported (Bi and Reiss, 1995; Paludan et al., 1998; Ellermann-Eriksen, 2005) . However, over expression of NO \u2212 , especially chronic, could have toxic side-effects also for the host cells (Brown, 2003) . Another mechanism that could be involved in the anti viral effect is the competition for attachment sites on the epithelial cell surfaces between probiotic bacteria and virus particles. This protective mode of action has already been cited in cell line interactions between probiotic bacteria and intestinal pathogens (Cocconier et al., 2000; Ouwenhand et al., 2001; Lievin-Le Moal et al., 2002; Maragkoudakis et al., 2006) , and implied as a possible mechanism of protection against VSV cell line infection (Boti\u0107 et al., 2007; Ivec et al., 2007) .",

In the case of L. casei Shirota, the high ROS release in the TLT cell line coincides with a high level of protection against TGEV in the same cell line. However, in all other cases with L. casei Shirota, no correlations can be found between ROS release and antiviral activity. In addition, the low attachment capacity of the strain, reported also elsewhere (Juntunen et al., 2001; Ouwenhand et al., 2001; Maragkoudakis et al., 2006) does not allow for direct linking of attachment ability and antiviral effect. Similar observations can be drawn with L. rhamnosus GG, which, in spite of a low ROS induction and attachment ability in all cell lines, was found to exert a major antiviral effect in both TGEV and RV, in all cell lines tested.",

In addition, on the goat epithelial cell line (GIE) strain PCA236 induced increase release of both NO \u2212 and H 2 O 2 . This could explain the antiviral activity obtained on the GIE monolayers with the particular LAB strain, where a notable protective effect against both RV and TGEV was observed. The attachment ability of the same strain however appears to be rather low (~10%), and so it is unclear if adhesion could contribute to the antiviral effect. The highattaching strain L. plantarum ACA-DC146, also able to induce increase ROS release in H4 and TLT, exhibited only low antiviral potential. Similarly, another strain with high-attachment ability, E. faecium PCD71, but no particular ROS release induction, exhibited only a mild antiviral effect on only once cell line (GIE).",

Each LAB-cell line-virus interaction is specific, barring the drawing of general and definite conclusions. It is however evident from the obtained results that probably more than one mechanism may be involved in the observed antiviral effect, as previously hypothesized in similar studies (Boti\u0107 et al., 2007; Ivec et al., 2007) . In addition, apart from ROS and attachment, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines as interleukins (IL) 6 and 12 or the antiviral interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), is an important mechanism by which probiotic bacteria may protect host cells (Miettinen et al., 1998; Hessle et al., 1999; Maassen et al., 2000; Ivec et al., 2007) . The mechanism of action of the antiviral effects reported in this study needs to be further investigated and so a more detailed, holistic approach would need to be adopted, focusing less on the screening of LAB strains against various cell lines and viruses, and more on in depth studies of the phenomenon. To conclude, this study reported for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a protective effect of lactic acid bacteria against TGEV and RV on animal and human intestinal and macrophage cell lines of non tumor origin. Although preliminary, the results presented here are of particular importance and merit further investigation, as they can lead to development of specific in vitro models for selection of probiotic strains with antiviral effects. Carefully selected probiotics could then be applied as animal feed supplement in order to provide specific protection against subclinical or acute viral diarrheas or intestinal disorders in general in farm animals.",
