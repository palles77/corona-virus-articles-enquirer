            "text": "Background: Viral infections contribute to morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF), but the impact of respiratory viruses on the development of airway disease is poorly understood. Methods: Infants with CF identified by newborn screening were enrolled prior to 4 months of age to participate in a prospective observational study at 4 centers. Clinical data were collected at clinic visits and weekly phone calls. Multiplex PCR assays were performed on nasopharyngeal swabs to detect respiratory viruses during routine visits and when symptomatic. Participants underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and a subset underwent pulmonary function testing. We present findings through 8.5 months of life. Results: Seventy infants were enrolled, mean age 3.1 \u00b1 0.8 months. Rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus (66%), followed by parainfluenza (19%), and coronavirus (16%). Participants had a median of 1.5 viral positive swabs (range 0-10). Past viral infection was associated with elevated neutrophil concentrations and bacterial isolates in BAL fluid, including recovery of classic CF bacterial pathogens. When antibiotics were prescribed for respiratory-related indications, viruses were identified in 52% of those instances. Conclusions: Early viral infections were associated with greater neutrophilic inflammation and bacterial pathogens. Early viral infections appear to contribute to initiation of lower airway inflammation in infants with CF. Antibiotics were commonly prescribed in the setting of a viral infection. Future investigations examining longitudinal relationships between viral infections, airway microbiome, and antibiotic use will allow us to elucidate the interplay between these factors in young children with CF.",

Historically, airway inflammation has been attributed to bacterial infection, though viral infections also play an important role in CF pulmonary disease [ 5 , 6 ] . Furthermore, evidence of structural airway disease including bronchiectasis has been reported in infants with CF, even in the absence of bacterial pathogens [ 4 ] . These findings suggest other factors, such as viral infections, may initiate the inflammation, chronic infection and progressive lung disease characteristic of CF lung disease.",

Compared to healthy counterparts, infants with CF acquire viral infections with a similar frequency, but are at greater risk for more prolonged, severe lower respiratory tract symptoms [ 5 , 8 ] and persistent lower airway obstruction [ 8 ] . Infants with CF hospitalized for viral infections have greater pulmonary inflammation, based on higher neutrophil, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and neutrophil elastase (NE) concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid compared to controls [ 9 ] . Viral infection in school-aged children with CF leads to declining forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) values [ 10 ] , and rhinovirus infection specifically is a risk factor for failure to recover FEV 1 following pulmonary exacerbation [ 11 ] . Viral infections in children with CF have been associated with new acquisition of common bacterial pathogens including Haemophilus influenzae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Moraxella catarrhalis [ 6 ] , and severe viral infections requiring hospitalization have been linked to early infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ 9 ] . Antiviral interventions, such as Palivizumab, reduce the rate and length of hospitalization due to RSV infection in CF infants [ 12 ] ; however, have shown no difference in age at first acquisition of P. aeruginosa or S. aureus [ 13 ] .",

We found viral infection was associated with higher concentrations of lavage neutrophils as well as the presence of bacterial isolates, including classic CF pathogens. These pathogens were associated with higher NE and IL-8 concentrations in BAL, consistent with previous studies [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] . Based on our protocol, bronchoscopy was typically performed during a time of clinical stability and not during an acute viral infection.

This contrasts with previous reports showing no changes in colonization or infection with typical CF pathogens following viral infection [ 6 , 30 ] . Of note, these studies primarily involved school-aged children who underwent BAL to detect viruses [ 6 , 9 ] . We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs to detect viruses and BAL to detect bacterial pathogens which may contribute to the difference in findings. There are several lines of evidence to support a mechanistic link between viral infections and lower airway bacterial colonization. Viral infections can damage the epithelial barrier, thus facilitating binding and translocation of bacteria into the airway [ 31 , 32 ] . In addition, viruses can decrease bacterial clearance contributing to the persistence of bacteria within the airway [ 33 ] . In COPD, rhinovirus specifically has been shown to impair bacterial phagocytosis by macrophages [ 34 ] . Others, using in vitro experiments, have shown alveolar macrophages are less able to mount an immune response to bacteria following HRV infection [ 35 , 36 ] . Viruses clearly play a role in the airway, the most significant of which may be their interaction with immune defense and bacteria.",

In contrast to the standard practice of watchful waiting and supportive care in non-CF infants with viral infections, the choice to use antibiotics in young children with CF with respiratory viral infections is more complicated. On one hand, we have to consider antibiotic stewardship [ 37 , 38 ] , along with the potential effects antibiotics have on commensal organisms and the developing microbiome [39] [40] [41] , and the growing sensitivity among clinicians regarding the use of antibiotics in CF care for symptoms that do not meet the clinical criteria of a pulmonary exacerbation [ 42 ] . These issues are juxtaposed by the potential benefits antibiotic treatment may have for the individual. For example the treatment or prevention of concurrent or subsequent bacterial infection, bacteria that may be linked to a poorer long-term prognosis [ 1 , 2 , 29 ] . Our data show a virus was present in roughly half of all instances in which a physician decided to start a new course of antibiotics; however bacterial cultures were not routinely collected at or after these events. Therefore, we are limited in our ability to address the potential benefits or detriments of these treatment decisions. These questions, particularly in infants and young children with CF, would benefit greatly from further investigation.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, very few individuals had detected early episodes of RSV, HMPV or influenza, limiting our ability to specifically investigate the effects of each individual virus. A relatively small number of viral infections occurred in participants during the first 8 months of life (median 1.5). Therefore, we divided the groups into \"never virus\" and \"any virus.\" We assumed participants did not have viruses before enrollment in the \"never virus\" group, unless medical history indicated otherwise. It is possible that individuals with prior or undetected viral infections were included in the \"never virus\" group(s). As we did not have physiologic measures prior to any viral infection, we were unable to assess whether children with more severe lung disease were more likely to be symptomatic with a virus or possibly the reverse. Also, per the study design, the majority of the NP swabs were collected when infants were symptomatic. Therefore, we could not accurately estimate asymptomatic carrier rates. Some infants completed their bronchoscopy and infant PFT visits within 1 month of enrollment, limiting the viral data available prior to and between these visits. This short observation period may have influenced our results. Only a subset of participants was able to complete pulmonary function testing, yielding a low number of participants for that analysis. This small sample size may have contributed to the lack of statistically significant differences between groups. Lastly, we did not have a control group due to the nature of the study protocol which included bronchoscopy and infant lung function testing, sedated procedures that would not be electively performed on healthy infants. However, there are multiple epidemiologic studies of viral infections in healthy infants to which our prevalence results are comparable [ 19 , 20 , 22 , 24 ] .",
