The influenza B viruses are not classified according to sub-types. Influenza C viruses cause mild illness in humans and do not cause epidemics or pandemics.

            "text": "When a new strain of human influenza virus emerges, antibody protection that may have developed after infection or vaccination with an older strain may not provide protection against the strain. Thus, the influenza vaccine is updated on a yearly basis to keep up with the changes in influenza viruses. 6(p2) Occasionally, the antigenic shift that occurs with the influenza A virus is an abrupt, major change in the virus. When this occurs, the virus has an HA protein or HA and NA protein combination that has not been seen in humans for many years. This leads to a new influenza A subtype for which most people have little or no immunity. If the virus is transmitted from human to human easily, the result may be a pandemic outbreak of influenza. 6 Transmission of human influenza (ie, A, B, C) primarily is via virus-laden droplets that are expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes. When a susceptible person is nearby (eg, within 3 ft), the droplets are deposited onto the mucosal surfaces of the person's upper respiratory tract (ie, close contact). Another mode of transmission may occur from direct or indirect contact with respiratory secretions of an infected person. At this time, studies have not demonstrated transmission of human influenza via contact with environmental surfaces. 13 Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is caused by viruses that occur naturally among birds. These viruses, which are seen worldwide, live in the gastrointestinal tract of wild birds. The viruses usually do not cause illness in wild birds, but when transmitted to domestic flocks, particularly poultry (eg, chickens, ducks, turkeys), it can be devastating. All subtypes of the influenza A viruses can be found in birds. 14 Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have occurred recently; however, most avian strains are of low pathogenicity. 15 Avian influenza usually does not affect humans. Since 1997, however, several cases of human infection with avian influenza viruses have occurred. 14 Avian viruses cross over to humans by direct contact from infected birds, contaminated surfaces, or through an intermediate host, such as a pig. 16 Adaptation of the avian influenza virus occurs via mutation of the avian virus genome or genetic reassortment, which is the mixing of segments from a virus already adapted to humans. 1 As an example, if a pig is infected simultaneously with a human influenza A virus and an avian influenza virus, the potential for reassortment exists, which could result in a new virus. This virus would have most of the genes from the human virus, and HA protein and/or NA protein from the avian virus, creating a virus with surface glycoproteins not previously seen in humans. The new virus may then infect humans and can spread from person to person. 16 Human reassortment also is possible. In this case, the human host would be infected with a human influenza strain and an avian influenza strain. If this were to happen, the reassortment would create a virus with HA from the avian virus and genes from the human virus, again resulting in a virus to which humans have little or no immunity. Consequences of this type of reassortment, in theory, could be sustained human-to-human transmission leading to an influenza pandemic. 16 The 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemics of the twentieth century were caused by a novel type of influenza A virus of avian origin. Mutation of the genes of what was originally pure avian virus is the suspected cause of the catastrophic 1918 pandemic. In the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, the viruses involved \"had components of previous human viruses as well as avian viruses.\" 15",

Nine of the people in Vietnam had direct contact with infected chickens. None of these patients had preexisting conditions. Their ages ranged from five to 24, with the median age being 13.7 years. After exposure, the median time of incubation was three days. The range of incubation was two to four days. Similar to with human influenza, the patients presented with fever and cough. They also had diarrhea, pronounced lymphopenia, and radiographic abnormalities. The mortality rate was significant, with eight patients dying after 10 days. These patients experienced liver dysfunction, renal failure, coagulopathy, and pancytopenia. The 1997 Hong Kong outbreak had the same clinical signs and symptoms as the Vietnam outbreak. Additionally, rhabdomyolysis was seen in this patient population.

The average additional cost per patient was $3,798. The total cost of the outbreak was $34,179. 18 When an influenza outbreak occurs in a health care setting, peers often have to work extended shifts. Extended shifts increase overtime costs, and studies show that attention lags after about 12 hours. In many cases, pool or temporary workers must replace health care workers who do not report to work due to illness. Additionally, regular staff members are less prone to patientcare errors than pool or temporary workers such as agency workers. 18 Risk to the health care worker An unvaccinated health care worker is an at-risk health care worker. This, of course, assumes that vaccination effectively protects against the current circulating strain of influenza causing the outbreak. If a strain of influenza rapidly appears for which effective vaccination has not been developed, or health care workers have not developed immunity from previous exposure to the circulating virus, health care workers will be at significant risk because of exposure to patients, family members, and those in the general population who have the disease.",

Consequently, standard precautions plus droplet precautions are recommended for the care of patients infected with human influenza. 19 Droplet precautions include patient placement, mask protocol, and patient transport. 20 A patient infected with human influenza should be placed in a private room. If a private room is not available, the patient should be placed in a room with another patient who is infected with the same microorganism but not with another infection. If this is not possible, spatial separation of a least three feet should be made between infected patients and other patients and visitors. 20 Staff members and visitors should wear masks according to protocols for droplet precautions. Additionally, the mask should be worn when anyone is within 3 ft of the patient. Transporting the patient infected with human influenza should be limited and should be only for essential purposes. If transport becomes necessary, the patient should wear a mask to help minimize dispersal of respiratory droplets. 20 Patients with avian influenza Recent outbreaks of avian influenza in humans indicate that the risk of serious disease and increased mortality may be significantly higher than infection by human influenza viruses. Although rare, when a human is infected with avian influenza, viral adaptation can occur, which may result in easier human-tohuman transmission. This in turn can possibly lead to the emergence of a pandemic strain. 19 Avian influenza presents additional challenges to health care workers because of the uncertainty about the exact modes of transmission of avian influenza to and between humans. Additional precautions for health care workers involved in the care of patients with documented or suspected avian influenza should be implemented. 19 Recommendations for avian influenza Patients arriving at a health care facility with fever and respiratory symptoms should be managed according to CDC guidelines for respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. They also should be questioned about their recent travel history. If a patient has traveled within the past 10 days to a country with avian influenza activity and is hospitalized with a severe febrile respiratory illness or is under evaluation for avian influenza, the patient should be managed using the following isolation precautions:",

If the facility does not have an isolation cubicle in the postanesthesia care unit, patients with SARS may need to be directly admitted to the intensive care unit isolation room for recovery. The nurse manager must confer with the physicians and OR nurses caring for patients with SARS to implement the plan of care. It is vital to adhere to infection control precautions to limit transmission of SARS to staff members.",

The patient should be orally suctioned in a gentle manner to prevent aerosolization when intubating. Health care providers must be careful and precise when removing and placing laryngoscope blades, endoscopes, or bronchoscopes to prevent splatter and minimize the opportunity of particle aerosolization. 23 The anesthesia care provider is at risk when performing endotracheal intubation. 40 He or she should minimize touching other equipment with gloves used for intubation or extubation. 23 Employees and physicians should understand the importance of proper hand hygiene after removing PPE. Personnel should wash hands with soap and water or use an alcoholbased waterless hand hygiene product before and after patient contact.
