Despite this abundance of resources, there has been modest growth and poverty reduction in the region when compared to others. The region as a whole has, however, achieved significant progress in health outcomes in the past few decades as a result of improved health systems focused on strengthening health service delivery, public health programs, and application of new medical technologies. These achievements at a regional level mask significant disparities among and within countries; these disparities, along with ongoing demographic transitions and epidemiologic changes, pose significant equity and efficiency challenges for MENA health systems.",

These health achievements can largely be attributed to the expansion of health services and public health programs and to educational and socioeconomic developments. In comparison with other countries (in Latin America and East Asia) of similar per capita incomes, the World Bank (Iqbal, 2006) has demonstrated that the MENA region has performed favorably on human development indicators in general and more specifically on health outcomes. While MENA countries had worse health indicators (using child mortality and life expectancy as proxies) in 1960 than comparable countries, the gap had been eliminated by 2000. The average infant mortality rate for the region has dropped from 137 per 1000 live births in 1970 to 21 per 1000 live births in 2012 ( Table 1) . The average life expectancy at birth for the region has increased to 71 years in 2012 from 65 years in 1990. However, these regional achievements hide disparities among and within countries of the region. For example, by World Bank estimates the infant mortality rate in 2012 ranged from 10 per 1000 live births in Kuwait to 46 in Yemen. In Egypt in 2008, infant mortality rates were 42 per 1000 live births among the poorest-income quintile households and 17 per 1000 live births among the highest-income quintile households in the country.",

Still, a number of countries face dual burdens of disease characterized by decreasing, but still prevalent, communicable diseases and increasing rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The WHO estimates that between 2010 and 2020 the burden of communicable diseases will decline from 29% to 20%, while the burden of NCDs will increase from 53% to 60%. Four main trends have driven changes in the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally: aging populations, increases in NCDs, shifts toward disabling causes and away from fatal causes, and changes in risk factors. Figure 1 shows that, among NCDs, diabetes, anxiety, drug use disorders, low back and other musculoskeletal disorders increased the most in the Middle East and North Africa between 1990 and 2010, while lower respiratory infections, diarrhea, and preterm birth complications decreased between 1990 and 2010.

Of public health concern is the increasing prevalence of tobacco use in the region, where tobacco-related deaths were projected by Murray and Lopez (1996) to increase from 2.4% in 1990-9.5% in 2020. Global smoking prevalence data presented by Jha et al. (2002) reveal that the overall MENA prevalence was 23%, less than the global average of 29%. Data from WHO/EMRO for subsequent years (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) indicate that the smoking prevalence rates in the MENA region are increasing ( Table 2) , with prevalence rates among men ranging from 15.5% in Oman to 77% in Yemen ( Figure 2) . The region is also experiencing a nutrition transition characterized by a high prevalence of stunting from undernutrition, particularly in low-income countries and certain geographic areas of middle-to high-income countries. There is also widespread iron-deficiency anemia and other micronutrient deficiencies, along with newer problems related to obesity from overnutrition and their links with NCDs/chronic conditions. The adoption of Western lifestyles, including decreased physical activity and significant increases in the consumption of energy-dense foods, has led to significant increases in the prevalence of overweight and obese populations. MENA along with the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and China face the greatest threat of increasing prevalence of overweight and obese children in the world.",

Kopits and Cropper (2003) indicate that in 1990 there were about 41 000 road traffic fatalities in MENA and predict that this number will be 94 000 in 2020, a 68% increase. Peden et al. (2004) reported that at 26.4 road traffic deaths per 100 000 population, low-and middle-income countries of MENA have among the highest rates in the world (compared to a global rate of 19 per 100 000). More than 130 000 people are killed yearly due to road traffic injuries in the MENA region, with an estimated cost of more than 3% of the regional GNI. The MENA road network carries only 2% of the world's fleet, yet it contributes to 10% of the traffic fatalities. The Global Burden of Disease estimates that car crashes are the leading cause of death in MENA for the 5-to 14-year-old age group since 2002, and will become the leading cause of death for the total population by 2015. Figure 3 demonstrates road-crash-related death rates per 100 000 population of selected MENA countries, which are generally higher than the rate for the United Kingdom.",

Much of this growth is among the young with 58% of the population less than 25 years old (UN, 2006) . Countries of the region are however at different stages of the demographic transition, ranging from those in the early transition stage with both high birth and death rates, such as Yemen and Djibouti, right up to those considered to have essentially completed the transition with both low birth and death rates, such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates. Migration to, from, and within the region is also a significant contributor to the population dynamics in MENAboth migration for official employment purposes, as well as due to internal and regional displacement. The oil-exporting countries of the region have hosted millions of foreign workers since the oil boom of the 1970s, with foreign workers constituting anywhere from 60% to 90% of workers in these countries. Arabs from other MENA countries and Asians from Pakistan, India, the Philippines, and Indonesia make up the majority of the foreign workers in the oil-exporting countries, which also have to provide services to address health concerns of the workers and their families. In addition, the region has the largest refugee population in the world. According to UNHCR, the region experienced the largest growth in internally displaced people (IDP) in 2012, increasing 40% from 2011 with numbers expected to continue to rise in 2013. The surge in refugees and IDPs is likely due to political conflict. Countries with already burdened health systems face great difficulties in providing health services to these refugee and IDP populations.",

The MENA region does, however, face the second-highest growth rate of HIV infection in the world. Unless effective and timely preventive measures are implemented, the disease could have significant social and economic consequences. Akala and El-Saharty (2006) estimate that health-related expenditures on HIV/ AIDS could reach, on average, 1.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of MENA countries by 2015. Economic losses would result from rising mortality and morbidity, which would reduce labor productivity, reduce capital investments, and shrink the labor force. HIV/AIDS surveillance systems to track the epidemic are particularly weak in the region. The lack of data, combined with high levels of stigma and discrimination against high-risk groups and HIV-infected persons, provides an optimal context for the disease to spread silently.",

Addressing systemic challenges will require more comprehensive health information systems that provide relevant data that are readily available for assessing priorities as well as for planning, managing, and implementing the required services. Unfortunately, the region generally lacks available, reliable, timely data to guide these processes. Many countries and large systems are investing substantively in electronic data capture and reporting systems; some are investing in electronic health records at the service delivery level. These systems afford the opportunity to produce data about system and clinical performance that could aid MENA health system managers to make more rational and evidence-informed decisions about how to improve the health system in the future.",

With 58% of the population less than 25 years of age and the highest unemployment rate, the proportion of the MENA population that is economically active is the lowest in the world. This has implications for how health insurance schemes in the region (social and private) can be more efficiently managed and maintained. The high dependency ratio adds more fiscal pressure on limited government health budgets, which need to be better targeted at addressing the needs of the most vulnerable populations. Governments can also take better advantage of the growing private health sector by fully regulating them and ensuring that private along with public investments are made in more cost-effective technologies.",

With the exception of a few countries (Saudi Arabia, Oman, and UAE), out-of-pocket expenditures accounted for at least 74% of private health expenditures in 2003 (see Table 2 ), which disproportionately affects the poorer populations, who can be further impoverished in the event of a catastrophic illness. MENA governments are increasingly interested in extending financial protection and improving access to health services by using different risk-pooling mechanisms, including social and private health insurance, and could benefit from global experiences in achieving these. Well-targeted social safety nets are needed to ensure adequate protection of citizens against the impoverishing effects of ill health.",

Where leadership and governance have been relatively stable, leaders are often challenged by limited support beyond the top-most level of leadership, inadequate ongoing leadership skill development, incomplete information for management, and many competing priorities expressed by varied stakeholders in the system (patients, providers, and policy-makers, to name a few). These are not unique situations to leading health systems anywhere in the world, but combined with some of the other challenges noted above, MENA health care system leaders are particularly challenged to deliver on the promise of providing high quality, effective, efficient, and equitable health care services to the populations of the MENA region.",
