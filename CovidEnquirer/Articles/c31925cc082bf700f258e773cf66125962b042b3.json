Methods: A reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay targeting the P gene was developed in this study and used to detect hMPV in nasal and throat swabs collected from 2936 immunocompetent adult patients with ARTIs in Beijing, China between July 2008 and June 2010. Results: Among the 2936 patients studied, 49 (1.7%) were positive for hMPV, of whom 14 (28.6%) were positive for hMPV_A2b, 19 (38.8%) for hMPV_B1, and 16 (32.6%) for hMPV_B2. hMPV_A1 was not detected. An average detection rate of 6.6% was observed in the peak months of the two epidemic seasons studied. The hMPV prevalence was higher in the Introduction Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a single-stranded, negative sense RNA virus belonging to the paramyxoviridae family and pneumovirus subfamily. 41 The hMPV genome, approximately 13 kb in length, encodes six genes, which produce at least eight proteins, including nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion glycoprotein (F), transcriptional enhancer protein (M2-1), small hydrophobic protein (SH), attachment glycoprotein (G), and large polymerase protein (L). Based on the phylogeny of the G gene, hMPV is divided into two genotypes (A and B) and further into four subtypes (A1, A2, B1, and B2). 3, 28 A novel sublineage A2b was identified in children in Germany in 2006. 21 hMPV infection evokes incomplete immunity and reinfection can occur in people of all ages. 10, 14, 15, 35, 42, 43 Prevalent worldwide, hMPV is an important respiratory pathogen that manifests in young children less than 5 years of age. 4, 11, 25, 32, 34, 38, 39 Clinical symptoms caused by hMPV infection are similar to respiratory syncytial virus and include fever, cough, wheezing, dyspnea, rhinorrhea, sputum production, and asthma. 6, 12, 32 Rates of hMPV infection range from 5.5% to 25% among children hospitalized with respiratory illness. 18e20, 25 In adults, the clinical manifestations of hMPV infection seem to depend on age and health conditions. In young adults (aged 14e25 years), the clinical symptoms of hMPV infection are similar to those of other respiratory viral infections. In contrast, in middle aged (aged 26e65 years) and healthy elderly adults (aged > 65 years), hMPV presents similarly to influenza infections and common colds. 13 Although the incidence of hMPV infection in healthy adults during winter is generally less than 6%, 5, 23, 30, 42 hMPV is considered to be a major contributor to the burden of respiratory illnesses in older adults. 42 Most studies of hMPV infection in adults have focused on the elderly and on immunocompromised people rather than on immunocompetent adults of all age groups. Although hMPV infection has been reported in healthy adults during winter seasons, 5, 14 further study of hMPV infection in healthy adults is needed during all seasons in consecutive years to evaluate the circulation patterns, clinical features, and clinical burden of hMPV infection in a given population. In this study, we developed a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay to evaluate the prevalence of hMPV infection in healthy adults with acute respiratory tract infections (AR-TIs) in Beijing, China. Clinical presentations and phylogenetic characteristics of hMPV infection were also investigated.",

A pair of primers targeting the P gene of hMPV was designed to generate an amplicon of 240 bp. Sequences of the forward and reverse primers were: 5 0 -TYAACATTGCWACAG-CAGGACC-3 0 and 5 0 -CTTCWGATTCWCCRCTTGTGCT-3 0 , corresponding to nt 1834e1855 and nt 2052e2073 of hMPV gz01 strain (GenBank accession no GQ153651), respectively. RT-PCR was performed using the One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Following the manufacturer's instructions, a 5 ml aliquot of the extracted total nucleic acids was used as the template. The RT-PCR assay consisted of initial reverse transcription at 48 C for 45 min and preamplification at 94 C for 3 min, followed by 35cycles of amplification at 94 C for 30 s, at 55 C for 30 s, and at 72 C for 30 s, and an additional extension at 72 C for 10 min. All PCR products of the expected size were verified by sequence analysis. The hMPV subtypes were identified by alignment of the PCR sequence with the corresponding reference sequences from GenBank database, using BLAST program (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi). Other common respiratory viruses in clinical specimens were simultaneously detected using RT-PCR or PCR assays, as described previously, 36 including influenza viruses (A, B and C), parainfluenza viruses (type 1e4), rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus (OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1) and respiratory syncytial virus. To avoid potential crosscontamination, master-mix preparation, nucleic acid extraction, assembly of the PCR reaction, and detection of the PCR products were performed in separate areas. Strict controls for nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification were also included.",

Such genotype replacement is believed to result from adaptive immunity of a population to the predominant circulating genotype. 1, 17, 22 In this study, analysis of the incidences of hMPV subtypes shows that hMPV_A (represented by hMPV_A2) was declining whereas hMPV_B (hMPV_B1 and B2) was rising from July 2008 to June 2010.

During the study year of July 2008eJune 2009, the peak circulation of hMPV occurred from November through March of the winter-spring season, with the highest detection rate of 7.3% in March 2009. During the study year of June 2009eJuly 2010, the peak circulation occurred from March through June of the springsummer season, with the highest detection rate of 5.9% in April 2010. The seasonality analysis of hMPV subtypes shows that hMPV_A2 was most prevalent between July 2008 and March 2009, with the highest detection rate in February 2009. We did not detect any hMPV_A2 between April 2009 and March 2010, but detected hMPV_B1 and hMPV_B2 in both study years with an approximately 2-fold higher detection rate for 2009e2010 than for 2008e2009 (Fig. 1).",
