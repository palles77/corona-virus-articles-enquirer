            "text": "One of the reasons for the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the lack of accuracy in detection tools in the clinical field. Molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. For this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to other Coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. To tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. The proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus.",

From a dataset of 553 complete genome non-repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average ac-: bioRxiv preprint curacy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation, identifying SARS-CoV-2 with an AUC of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification. Then, using the same basis, we classify SARS-CoV-2 from 384 complete viral genome sequences with human host, that contain the gene ORF1ab from the NCBI with a 10-fold accuracy of 98.17% , a specificity of 0.9797 and sensitivity of 1.00. These preliminary results seem encouraging enough to identify deep learning as a promising research venue to develop assisted detection tests for SARS-CoV-2. At this end the interaction between viromics and deep learning, will hopefully help to solve global infection problems. In addition, we offer our code and processed data to be used for diagnostic purposes by medical doctors, virologists and scientists involved in solving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As more data become available we will update our system.",

In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has an estimated mortality rate of 3-4%, and it is spreading faster than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [8] . SARS-CoV-2 assays can yield false positives if they are not targeted specifically to SARS-CoV-2, as the virus is closely related to other Coronavirus organisms. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 may present 25 with other respiratory infections, which make it even more difficult to identify [9, 10] . Thus, it is fundamental to improve existing diagnostic tools to contain the spread. For example, diagnostic tools combining computed tomography (CT) scans with deep learning have been proposed, achieving an improved detection accuracy of 82.9% [11] . Another solution for identifying SARS-CoV-2 30 is additional sequencing of the viral complementary DNA (cDNA). We can use sequencing data with cDNA, resulting from the PCR of the original viral RNA; e,g, Real-Time PCR amplicons ( Fig. 1) to identify the SARS-CoV-2 [12]. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990242 doi: bioRxiv preprint Classification using viral sequencing techniques is mainly based on alignment methods such as FASTA [13] and BLAST [14] . These methods rely on the 35 assumption that DNA sequences share common features, and their order prevails among different sequences [15, 16] . However, these methods suffer from the necessity of needing base sequences for the detection [17] . Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop innovative improved diagnostic tools that target the genome to improve the identification of pathogenic variants, as sometimes several tests, 40 are needed to have an accurate diagnosis. As an alternative deep learning methods have been suggested for classification of DNA sequences, as these methods do not need pre-selected features to identify or classify DNA sequences. Deep",

This procedure is 95 different from previous methods, that relied upon one-hot encoding [21, 20] , and has the advantages of making the input more human-readable and do not multiply the amount of memory required to store the information. We divide the available samples in two parts, 90% for training and validation (80% training, 10% validation), and 10% for testing, in a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. k-100 fold cross-validation is a procedure by which available data is divided into k parts, called folds. At each iteration i, the i-th fold is used as a test set, while all the other folds are used as training. At the end of the k-th iteration, the average performance of the model in test over all folds provides a good estimate of the generality of the results. In this particular case, we use stratified folds, 105 that preserve the same proportion of classes in every fold. The procedure is summarized by Fig. 3. ",
