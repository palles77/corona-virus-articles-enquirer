            "text": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy among women. Although endocrine therapy is effective, the development of endocrine resistance is a major clinical challenge. The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor malignancy, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) within the TME play a crucial role in endocrine resistance. Herein, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between TAM and the endocrine-resistant phenotype of breast cancer. Macrophages were cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from tamoxifen-sensitive (MCF7-S) or -resistant (MCF7-R) MCF7 breast cancer cells. M2 polarization was detected by CD163 immunofluorescence. To determine the effect on endocrine resistance, MCF7 cells were cultured in the supernatant of different TAM, and then treated with tamoxifen. CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) immunohistochemistry was carried out on pathological sections from 100 patients with invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. We found that macrophages cultured in the CM of MCF7-S and MCF7-R cells were induced into TAM, with a more obvious M2 polarization in the latter. Tamoxifen resistance was increased by culture in TAM medium. TAM secreted CCL2, which increased endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells through activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. High expression of CCL2 was correlated with infiltration of CD163+macrophages (r = 0.548, P < .001), and patients with high CCL2 expression presented shorter progression-free survival than those with low CCL2 expression (P < .05). We conclude that CCL2 secreted by TAM activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and promotes an endocrine resistance feedback loop in the TME, suggesting that CCL2 and TAM may be novel therapeutic targets for patients with endocrineresistant breast cancer.",

            "text": "Solid tumors such as breast cancer usually contain heterogeneous populations of neoplastic cells, immune cells, and collections of tissue-specific resident and recruited stromal cell types, which together form the TME. 7, 8 The relevance of this tumor heterogeneity is linked to various hallmarks of cancer including drug resistance. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Macrophages are diverse cells that show distinct phenotypes depending on their anatomical location and activating stimuli. 15, 16 In breast cancer, macrophages can comprise up to 50% of the TME. 17 Among them, M2-type macrophages, commonly referred to as TAM, are associated with tumor malignancy. 18, 19 CD163, a scavenger receptor, is regarded as a highly specific monocyte/macrophage marker for M2 polarization. 20 Escamilla et al reported that TAM are involved in the resistance of patients with prostate cancer to androgen blockade therapy. 21 In our previous study, we found a correlation between TAM and tamoxifen resistance in patients with breast cancer, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. 22 Tumor-associated macrophages secrete a variety of chemokines into the TME including CCL2, which is secreted mainly by macrophages when cocultured with MCF7 cells. 23 CCL2 is also known as MCP-1 and small inducible cytokine A2. CCL2 belongs to the CC chemokine family that recruits monocytes, memory T cells, and dendritic cells to sites of inflammation. 24, 25 Several studies have reported that CCL2 and the inflammatory environment promote the malignant behavior of different tumors. [26] [27] [28] Xu et al found that CCL2 recruits monocytes to the TME and polarizes macrophages into the M2 type. 25 Secretion of CCL2 is also an important manifestation of TAM polarization in macrophages. 29 Ueno et al showed that a high level of CCL2 expression is a significant indicator of earlier relapse. 30 However, there have been only a few studies on the role of CCL2 in endocrine resistance of breast cancer.",

When MCF7 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L CCL2, phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR was significantly increased. Adding CM of MR to MCF7 cells also activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. When MR was treated with 300 nmol/L Bindarit (a CCL2 synthesis inhibitor), the ability of the CM (MR + Bindarit) to increase the levels of phosphorylated Akt and mTOR was weakened ( Figure 2G ).

We have already determined that the levels of CCL2 secreted by M\u03a6, MS, and MR are different. The next question is whether the chemotaxis of THP-1 cells induced by these three F I G U R E 2 CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) secreted by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to induce endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells. A, RT-PCR shows the transcription of seven cytokines in three macrophages, M\u03a6, TAM from a tamoxifen-sensitive tumor microenvironment (TME) (MS), and TAM from tamoxifen-resistant TME (MR). Only the change trend of CCL2 is consistent with the previous experiment results, and the difference was statistically significant. B, CCL2 levels in the conditioned medium (CM) of tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 breast cancer cells (MCF7-S), tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells (MCF7-R), M\u03a6, MS, and MR cells. CCL2 was mainly produced by macrophages rather than breast cancer cells. C, Relative viability of MCF7 and MCF7 + CCL2 (100 nm/mL) cells treated with 5 \u03bcmol/L tamoxifen. D, Relative viability of T47D and T47D + CCL2 (100 nm/mL) cells treated with 5 \u03bcmol/L tamoxifen. E, Apoptosis of MCF7 and MCF7 + CCL2 (100 nm/mL) cells was analyzed by flow cytometry at 24 h after adding 5 \u03bcmol/L tamoxifen. F, Apoptosis of T47D and T47D + CCL2 (100 nm/mL) cells was analyzed by flow cytometry at 24 h after adding 5 \u03bcmol/L tamoxifen. G, Western blot analysis of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. CCL2 and CM of MR could activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in MCF7 cells. When MR was treated with Bindarit for 24 h, activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by CM decreased. *P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .001 F I G U R E 3 Tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 breast cancer cells (MCF7-S) and tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells (MCF7-R) secrete tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 and induce activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and mTORC1-FOXK1 pathways in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). A, TNF\u03b1 levels in conditioned medium (CM) from MCF7-S, MCF7-R, M\u03a6, TAM from a tamoxifen-sensitive tumor microenvironment (TME) (MS), and TAM from tamoxifen-resistant TME (MR) cells. Level of TNF\u03b1 in the CM of TAM was higher, but the difference between MS and MR was not significant (NS). B, Western blot analysis of the NF-\u03baB pathway. CM of MCF7-S and MCF7-R could activate the NF-\u03baB pathway of TAM. C, Western blot analysis of the mTORC1-FOXK1 pathway. CM of MCF7-S and MCF7-R could activate the mTORC1-FOXK1 pathway of TAM. Dephosphorylation of MR was more obvious than that of MS. Therefore, CM of MCF7-R can promote activation of the mTORC1-FOXK1 pathway more than MCF7-S. *P < .05, **P < .01 macrophages coincides with the secretion of CCL2. Results of the chemotaxis assay confirmed that the chemotaxis-inducing effect of TAM toward THP-1 cells was stronger than that of macrophages, the chemotaxis-inducing effect of MR was stronger than that of MS, and Bindarit the inhibitor of CCL2 reverses the enhanced chemotaxis ability of MR ( Figure 4A ). To further validate this phenomenon in vitro, we analyzed tissue samples from 100 patients with ER-positive breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry of serial pathological sections showed that a high expression of CCL2 in the paraneoplastic stroma was correlated with infiltration of CD163+ macrophages (r = 0.548, P < .001) ( Figure 4B and Table S2 ). We propose that tumor cells stimulate M2 polarization of macrophages, which leads to increased secretion of CCL2, and a high concentration of CCL2 in turn promotes THP-1 aggregation to form more M2-like macrophages.",

            "text": "To determine the clinical relevance of CCL2 and endocrine resistance in the in vitro findings, we selected 100 patients with invasive ER-positive breast cancer who received regular endocrine therapy at the Tumor Hospital of Harbin Medical University from 2004 to 2014 F I G U R E 4 High concentration of CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) recruits monocytes and macrophages to facilitate an endocrine-resistant microenvironment in breast cancer. A, Representative photos of THP-1 cells recruited by the conditioned medium (CM) of M\u03a6, TAM from a tamoxifen-sensitive tumor microenvironment (TME) (MS), TAM from tamoxifen-resistant TME (MR), and MR + Bindarit after the chemotaxis assay. Quantitative results show that the chemotaxis ability of TAM to recruit THP-1 cells was enhanced, and TAM in the endocrine-resistant environment had stronger chemotaxis ability. Bindarit reverses the enhanced chemotaxis ability of CM (MR). B, Representative images of immunohistochemical staining for CCL2 and CD163 and HE staining in serial sections from human breast cancer samples. The related correlation analyses showed r = .548. *P < .05, **P < .01 F I G U R E 5 CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) expression in the stroma correlated with poor recurrence-free survival of patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. A, Different patterns of CCL2 immunohistochemical staining in the stroma of breast cancer cells. B, Kaplan-Meier recurrence-free survival curves of patients with hormone receptorpositive breast cancer with low (n = 71) and high (n = 29) CCL2 expression in the stroma (P = .029). C, Proposed model for TAM-secreted CCL2 activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to promote a malignant cycle of endocrine resistance and recruitment of monocytes (Table S3) Results showed that PFS of the CCL2 high-expression group was significantly shorter than that of the CCL2 low-expression group (P < .05). The prognostic value of each clinicopathological feature was assessed using Cox hazard regression analysis. CCL2 expression was found to be an independent risk factor for disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 2.323, P = .015) ( Table 1) . Taken together, these results indicate a crucial role of CCL2 in promoting endocrine resistance in breast cancer. We also found that TAM promote endocrine resistance by secreting CCL2, which activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, CCL2 plays an important role in this malignant feedback loop. In addition, CCL2 promotes the aggregation of monocytes and macrophages in the TME. 48 The transition from monocytes to TAM further promotes the formation of the endocrine-resistant microenvironment. Analysis of tissue samples from patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer confirmed a correlation between high expression of CCL2 in the paraneoplastic stroma and infiltration of CD163+ macrophages. Moreover, patients with high CCL2 expression in the stroma had a shorter PFS after endocrine therapy. This is consistent with the findings of our previous study that patients with high CD163+ macrophage infiltration tend to develop endocrine resistance. 22 The finding that CCL2 promotes the formation of the TME and the malignant cycle of cells in the TME may partly explain why patients with endocrine resistance in the past are more likely to be resistant to new endocrine therapy.",

Thus, we conclude that the increased M2 polarization of TAM increased their ability to resist apoptosis and promote endocrine resistance.

After reviewing the relevant literature, we selected seven cytokines (CXCL-1, CCL2, CCL5, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, IL-17, and CXCL-5) that may promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells.[37][38][39][40][41][42][43] Transcription of these seven cytokines in the three macrophages (M\u03a6, MS, and MR) was assessed by RT-PCR to identify the cytokines whose transcription levels were consistent with the trends from the CCK-8 and apoptotic flow cytometry assays. Only CCL2 was consistent with the previous results and the difference was statistically significant(Figure 2A). IL-6 also has the ability to promote endocrine resistance, and the transcription in MS and MR is different. However, our results showed that the transcription of IL-6 in M\u03a6 and MS was not statistically significant. Secretion of IL-6 could not explain the difference between M\u03a6 and MS in promoting drug resistance of endocrine tumors. Therefore, IL-6 was not chosen as the main object of the present study. To exclude the effect of autocrine CCL2 from cancer cells, we measured CCL2 expression levels in MCF7-S and MCF7-R cells by ELISA, and did not detect significant levels.",

At present, most studies on the mechanism of endocrine resistance are focused on breast cancer cells, and only a few studies have focused on the role of other cells in the TME. TAM are an important component of the TME that play a role in angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumor malignancy.43,47 Our previous studies have confirmed that TAM are correlated with tamoxifen resistance in patients with breast cancer.22 In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying TAM-mediated endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells.We showed that endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells can induce M2 polarization of TAM. M2-polarized TAM, in turn, promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells. We found that breast cancer cells secrete trace amounts of TNF\u03b1 and promote autocrine secretion of TNF\u03b1 in macrophages, thereby activating the NF-\u03baB pathway and promoting CCL2 release. Endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells activate the mTORC1-FOXK1 pathway of macrophages by altering amino acid metabolism in the environment, further promoting M2 polarization and CCL2 secretion by macrophages.",

However, there are only a few studies on the role of these cells in the endocrine resistance of breast cancer, and there is no report on the effect of endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells on the differentiation of these cells. Future research should focus on the effect of other cell components in the TME on the endocrine resistance of breast cancer. In conclusion, our results indicate that endocrine-resistant tumor cells are more likely to promote M2 polarization of macrophages, whereas M2-polarized TAM further promote endocrine resistance in tumor cells, thus forming a positive feedback loop between TAM and breast cancer cells (Figure 5C). CCL2 plays an important role in this positive feedback loop. Increased CCL2 secretion by M2-polarized TAM activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in tumor cells to promote endocrine resistance and formation of the endocrine-resistant microenvironment by aggregating monocytes into the TME. These findings suggest that CCL2 and TAM may be potential novel therapeutic targets for patients with endocrine-resistant breast cancer.",
