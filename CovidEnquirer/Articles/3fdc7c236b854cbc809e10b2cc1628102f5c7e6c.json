Here, we show that a DNA vaccine encoding the first 725 amino acids (S1) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein induces antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. With three immunizations, high titers of neutralizing antibodies (up to 1: 10 4 ) were generated without adjuvant. DNA vaccination with the MERS-CoV S1 gene markedly increased the frequencies of antigenspecific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells secreting IFN-c and other cytokines. Both pcDNA3.1-S1 DNA vaccine immunization and passive transfer of immune serum from pcDNA3.1-S1 vaccinated mice protected Ad5-hDPP4-transduced mice from MERS-CoV challenge. These results demonstrate that a DNA vaccine encoding MERS-CoV S1 protein induces strong protective immune responses against MERS-CoV infection.",

MERS-CoV was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and MERS cases have been reported in 27 countries since then [1, 2] . As of February 10, 2017, 1905 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 677 deaths related to MERS-CoV, had been reported to WHO ($36% mortality). Several family clusters and nosocomial clusters cases have been reported, revealing the human-to-human transmissibility of MERS-CoV, and raising the concern of a MERS-CoV global pandemic [3] [4] [5] . Currently, no licensed therapeutic or vaccine is available, which highlights the need for efficient vaccines against MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV is the first lineage of Betacoronavirus known to infect humans [26] . The genome of MERS-CoV encodes four structural proteins -spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) [27] . The S protein, a class I fusion protein forming protruding spikes on the virus surface, is composed of an N-terminal S1 subunit and a C-terminal S2 subunit [28] . It has been reported that MERS-CoV binds to host cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) through an independently folded receptor binding domain (RBD) localized within the S1 subunit [29, 30] . Moreover, S protein has been identified as the most immunogenic antigen of MERS-CoV. It plays an important role in the induction of neutralizing antibody and anti-viral T-cell responses [28] the major target for current vaccines development to protect against MERS [8, 10, 28] . However, previous studies have demonstrated that vaccines based on full-length S potentially induce harmful side effects caused by non-neutralizing epitopes [27, 31] . In contrast, RBD protein-based subunit vaccines are able to induce both neutralizing antibody and anti-viral T-cell responses against MERS-CoV infection, with the additional superiority of safety [28] . Nevertheless, to improve the immunogenicity of these subunit vaccines, it has been found necessary to use an appropriate adjuvant or even adjuvant combinations, or immune enhancers (e.g., human IgG Fc), and optimized delivery routes and doses [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . An ideal MERS vaccine should induce potent neutralizing antibody response without inducing harmful immune effects such as virus-enhancing antibody or immunopathology [28, 32] . Based on the established background and our previous research results, we selected S1 protein as the target for our DNA vaccine development.",

As shown in Fig. 2B , no significant differences were observed between samples harvested 1 week and 2 weeks post the third immunization, indicating that the antibody response reached the plateau. To determine if the antibodies in the immune serum could neutralize MERS-CoV infection in vitro, a plaque reduction neutralizing assay was performed using serially diluted serum samples.

We speculated that T cell responses were also generated at the same time. As expected, significantly more SFCs of both IFN-c and IL-4 were detected in splenocytes from pcDNA3.1-S1 treated mice ( Fig. 3A and B ) than controls. The frequencies of IFN-c-expressing CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the mice injected with pcDNA3.1-S1 was significantly higher after MERS RBD stimulation (Fig. 3C and D) , and similar results were observed for IL-4-expressing CD4 + and CD8 + T cells ( Fig. 3E and F) . These results demonstrate that the pcDNA3.1-S1 DNA vaccine markedly increased the frequencies of antigenspecific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells.",

Considering that currently no studies have compared the immunogenicity of different S gene fragments in MERS DNA vaccines, we choose three mutants of MERS-CoV S protein as antigens: full-length S, SDCD, and extracellular domain S1. Of the three DNA vaccines (pcDNA3.1-S, pcDNA3.1-SDCD, and pcDNA3.1-S1) constructed, pcDNA3.1-S1 DNA vaccine was selected for further study since it elicited the highest antibody titer in immunized mice and contained major neutralizing epitopes [27] , which made it an effective and safe target for MERS vaccine development. Similar to our DNAbased vaccine, an adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector-based vaccine, Ad5. MERS-S1 expressing the MERS-CoV S1 extracellular domain, induced stronger neutralizing antibody responses when compared to the vector expressing full-length S [8] . This may be because the S1 fragment that can induce humoral immune responses more efficiently than full length S since it is soluble and can easily be taken up by B cells in lymph node follicles [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Of note, pcDNA3.1-SDCD immunization induced a slightly higher antibody response in mice than did pcDNA3.1-S, possibly because the SDCD mutant still contains the transmembrane region anchoring the S protein to the membrane. Previous studies have shown that partial or complete removal of the SARS-CoV S cytoplasmic domain, or removal of the transmembrane domain along with the cytoplasmic domain from a DNA vaccine candidate increased the neutralizing antibody response in mice, indicating that removal of the cytoplasmic domain may result in a more native and more functionally relevant structure in vivo [38] . We considered that besides the influence of expression level differences, such modifications of the MERS-CoV S protein may also be responsible for the increased generation of a neutralizing antibody response.",

High levels of neutralizing antibodies were generated following three immunizations without adjuvant. Furthermore, both pcDNA3.1-S1 DNA vaccination and administration of immune serum from pcDNA3.1-S1 vaccinated mice accelerated virus clearance in the lungs, suggesting that neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV S1 protein were protective and the immune serum transfer did not mediate an antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in this Ad5-hDPP4-transduced mouse model (Fig. 5B) . We chose 12 days post the third immunization to challenge our mice because we just had limited access to BSL-3 labs, and we speculated that since the antibody response reached the plateau and T cell response is probably at the peak at this time point as well, they would not diminish so quickly after the third immunization. However, this could be a potential limitation. Long-term protection experiments are still required to evaluate the efficacy of this vaccine.",

Splenocytes were isolated two weeks following the second immunization and stimulated with or without the purified RBD protein. The S1-specific IFN-c and IL-4 activities in splenocytes were evaluated using commercial ELISpot kits. SFCs secreting IL-4 (A) and IFN-c (B) were enumerated in an automated ELISpot reader. The ability of the pcDNA3.1-S1 DNA vaccine to induce IFN-c-and IL-4-expression in antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells was analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining. Cells were stained with combined mouse anti-CD4-FITC and anti-CD8-PE, anti-IFN-c-PE-Cy7 and anti-IL-4-PE-Cy3 monoclonal antibodies. CD4 + T cells expressing IFN-c (C) and IL-4 (D) and CD8 + T cells expressing IFN-c (E) and IL-4 (F) were analyzed in a FACSAria TM Cell Sorter. n = 3 mice/group/time point.
