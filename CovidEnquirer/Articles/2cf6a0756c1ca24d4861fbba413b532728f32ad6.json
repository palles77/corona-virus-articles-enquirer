DIs require coinfection by a helper virus to replicate. They may play an important role in modulation of viral disease or they may simply be artifacts that arise in laboratory studies. Related to DIs, at least conceptually, are satellites of viruses, which can replicate only in the presence of a helper. Satellites are known for many plant viruses and are known to influence the virulence of the helper viruses. Completely different are agents called viroids. Viroids consist of small, naked RNA molecules that are capable of directing their own replication. They do not encode protein, but instead contain promoter elements that cause cellular enzymes to replicate them. Many are important plant pathogens. Related to viroids are virusoids, which are satellites of viruses that resemble packaged viroids. There are also agents that combine the attributes of both satellites and viroids, such as hepatitis delta virus, which is an important human pathogen. Finally, prion diseases, caused by infectious agents whose identity is controversial but which may consist only of protein, are discussed.",

DIs are defective because they have lost essential functions required for replication. Thus, they require the simultaneous infection of a cell by a helper virus, which is normally the parental wild-type virus from which the DI arose. They interfere with the replication of the parental virus by competition for resources within the cell. These resources include the machinery that replicates the viral nucleic acid, which is in part encoded by the helper virus, and the proteins that encapsidate the viral genome to form virions.",

            "text": "The most highly evolved DI RNAs are often not translated and consist of deleted and rearranged versions of the parental genome. In the case of alphaviruses, whose genome is about 12 kb (Chapter 3), DI RNAs have been described that are about 2 kb in length. However, they have a sequence complexity of only 600 nucleotides, because sequences are repeated one or more times. The sequences of two such DI RNAs of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) are illustrated schematically in Fig. 9 .1. From the sequences of these DIs as well as DIs of other alphaviruses, specific functions for the elements found in these DIs have been proposed. Other approaches have then been used to confirm the hypotheses derived from such sequence studies. Thus, the 3\u2032 end of the parental RNA, which is retained in all alphavirus DI RNAs, forms a promoter for the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis from the plus-strand genome. The 5\u2032 end of the RNA is also preserved in many DI RNAs, such as those illustrated in Fig.  9 .1. Surprisingly, however, it has been replaced by a cellular tRNA in some DI RNAs. The complement of this sequence is present at the 3\u2032 end of the minus strand, where it forms a promoter for initiation of genomic RNA synthesis. The finding that the DI RNAs with the tRNA as the 5\u2032 terminus have a selective advantage over the parental genome during RNA replication suggests that this promoter is a structural element recognized by the viral replicase. It also suggests that the element present in the genomic RNA is suboptimal, perhaps because the genomic RNA must be translated as well as replicated. Finally, repeated sequences from two regions of the genome are present in all alphavirus DI RNAs. It is thought that one sequence (shown as red patterned blocks in Fig. 9 .1) is an enhancer element for RNA replication and the second (shown as yellow and green patterned blocks) is a packaging signal. Repetition of these elements may increase the efficiency of replication and packaging of the DI RNA.",

Some DI RNAs are simply deleted RNA genomes, but others have rearrangements at the ends of the RNAs. Representative examples are illustrated in Fig. 9 .2A. During replication of the RNA, the sequences at the ends must contain promoter elements for initiation of RNA synthesis. More genomic RNA (minus strand that is packaged in virions) is made than antigenomic RNA (which functions only as a template for genomic RNA synthesis) and therefore the promoter at the 3\u2032 end of the antigenomic RNA is stronger than the promoter at the 3\u2032 end of the genomic RNA. Thus, it is not surprising that some DI RNAs have the stronger promoter at the 3\u2032 ends of both (+) and (\u2212)RNA (as in Class II DIs), ensuring more rapid replication of the DI RNAs. The DI RNAs may have the luxury of doing this because they are not translated nor do they serve as templates for the synthesis of mRNAs.",

The best studied examples of this are DIs of poliovirus and of coronaviruses (these viruses are described in Chapter 3). DI RNAs of poliovirus are uncommon and contain deletions in the structural protein region. It has been suggested that in this case it is the translation product that is required for efficient replication of the RNA (the replicase translated from the RNA may preferentially use as a template for replication the RNA from which it was translated). In contrast, for at least one well-studied DI of a coronavirus, translation of the RNA is required for efficient replication, but the translation product is not important. In this case, translation may stabilize the DI RNA, since there appears to be a cellular pathway to rid the cell of mRNAs that are not translatable. If so, it is uncertain how DI RNAs that are not translated avoid this pathway. Some representative naturally occurring DIs of mouse hepatitis virus, a murine coronavirus, are illustrated in Fig. 9 .2B.",

Adapted from Strauss and Strauss (1997), Figure 1. influenza virus, passed at high multiplicity for many passages, produced yields that cycled between high and low. This effect is illustrated schematically in Fig. 9 .3A. We now know that this is due to the presence of DI particles. In early passages virus yields are high. When DIs arise, they depress the yield of virus. Because high multiplicities of infection are required to maintain DI replication, so that cells are infected with both the helper and the DI, low yields of virus lead to a reduction in DI replication in the next passage or two. Reduced DI replication leads to higher yields of virus. Thus, the yield of infectious virus continues to fluctuate.",

When virus is passed at high multiplicity for very many generations, mutants often arise that have altered promoters that are recognized by mutant replication proteins. Such mutants are resistant to the DIs that are in the population at the time, because the mutant replication proteins do not recognize the promoters in the DIs. The mutant virus rapidly takes over the population of virus because of its selective advantage. However, new DIs then arise that will interfere with the mutant virus, and the cycle repeats. It is unclear whether DI particles serve a biological role in nature or whether they are artifacts of abortive recombination that appear in the laboratory because of the high multiplicities of infection that are often used. It has been argued that DIs may arise late in the infection of an animal by a virulent virus and lead to attenuation of symptoms by reducing the yield of infectious virulent virus. As described in earlier chapters, such attenuation could be important for the persistence of a virus in nature. Hepatitis delta virus, described later, is a satellite that replicates only in a cell infected by HBV. Thus, it is clear that it is possible to achieve the multiplicities required to maintain a defective virus in at least some circumstances. Reconstruction experiments in mice have shown that it is possible to attenuate the virulence of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus by injecting DIs along with the virus. However, it is not clear that DIs will arise in an acute infection in time to ameliorate symptoms. Thus, it has not been possible to provide firm evidence that DIs actually modulate the virulence of their parents in nature, and the question remains open.",

Sequenced viroids range from 246 to 375 nucleotides and possess extensive internal base pairing that results in the RNA being rodlike and about 15 nm long. A partial listing of viroids is given in Table 9 .2. All known viroids infect plants. However, hepatitis \u03b4, which infects humans, has many viroid-like properties and may be related to viroids. Many viroids are important agricultural pathogens, whereas others replicate without causing symptoms. Viroids are often transmitted through vegetative propagation of plants, but can also be transmitted during agricultural or horticultural practices in which contaminated instruments are used. Some viroids can be transmitted through seeds and at least one viroid is transmitted by an aphid. On infection of a plant cell, viroid RNA is transported to the nucleus. The circular RNA appears to be copied by host-cell RNA polymerase II, using a rolling circle mechanism in which multimeric antigenomic sense RNA molecules are produced. The multimeric antigenome sense RNA can then be used as a template to make multimeric genomic sense RNA. This synthesis may also be performed by RNA polymerase II. The concatenated RNAs are cleaved and cyclized to produce the progeny viroid RNA molecules. In an infected cell, as many as 10 4 viroid RNAs can accumulate, most of them in the nucleus. Some viroids are capable of self-cleavage by the concatenated RNAs to produce genome-length RNAs, followed by self-ligation to cyclize the unit-length molecule. Other viroids are not capable of self-cleavage and ligation. There are five groups of non-self-cleaving viroids, classified by the sequences in the central conserved region. The structures of these five groups are shown in Fig. 9 .4. The conserved domains highlighted in the figure are thought to be important for the replication of the viroid (i.e., to form promoters recognized by RNA polymerase II) and for its cleavage to produce unit-length molecules. A pathogenesis domain is also highlighted. Changes in this domain affect the virulence of the viroid on infection of its plant host. For nonself-cleaving viroids, it is assumed that the concatenated RNAs are cleaved and ligated by host-cell enzymes.",

In the nucleus, the RNA is replicated by mechanisms related to those used by viroid RNA. However, there is the added complication that an mRNA for HDAg must also be produced. Thus, there are three elements to the replication of RNA: the production of an antigenomic RNA template from genomic RNA, the production of mRNA for HDAg from genomic RNA, and the production of genomic RNA from antigenomic RNA templates. It is believed that synthesis of genomes from antigenomic templates and synthesis of the mRNA from genomic templates are carried out by RNA polymerase II. However, synthesis of antigenomes from genomic templates may utilize another polymerase, perhaps RNA polymerase I. Other, currently unknown host factors also participate, and the HDAg, of which there are two kinds, S-HDAg and L-HDAg, as described later, both of which can be modified in various ways, is absolutely required.

Furthermore, synthesis of genomic and antigenomic RNA may occur in different places in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of genomes is sensitive to inhibition by amanitin, requires S-HDAg that has been phosphorylated, methylated, and acetylated, and the RNA product is immediately exported to the cytoplasm. Synthesis may occur in the nucleoplasm. In contrast, synthesis of antigenomes is resistant to amanitin, requires L-HDAg but does not require its phosphorylation or acetylation, and the RNA product is retained in the nucleus.

Synthesis of mRNA is also sensitive to amanitin, suggesting that RNA Pol II is involved and synthesis may occur in the nucleoplasm.

This protein is required for RNA replication. Thus, for example, in vitro systems to study the replication of HDV RNA must be supplemented with S-HDAg for replication to occur. S-HDAg is a component of the infecting particle and is therefore present in the infecting cell when RNA replication first begins. Production of new protein after infection enables RNA replication to accelerate. A second form of \u03b4 antigen is also produced during infection. An RNA-editing event occurs in about one-third of the antigenomic templates, in which the termination codon UAG, at position 196 of the ORF for the \u03b4 antigen is changed to UGG, encoding tryptophan (see Fig. 9 .8). This change is thought to be effected by deamination, in the antigenome, of the adenosine in the UAG codon to produce inosine. A cellular adenosine deaminase has been described that probably performs this function. Inosine pairs as guanosine, and continued replication of the RNA will lead to the substitution of G for A. This RNA editing site is specific and requires specific sequences within the antigenomic RNA for it to occur. Change of the termination codon to a tryptophan codon leads to the production of a polypeptide that is 19 residues longer, for a total length of 214 amino acids, referred to as the large d antigen or L-HDAg. Because editing is required, it is only produced later in the infection cycle. The extent of editing is controlled, perhaps by S-HDAg. Obviously, only genomes that are not edited can give rise to infectious virions. S-HDAg is required for replication, and only nonedited genomes encode it. HDAg can be phosphorylated on Ser-2, Ser-177, and Ser-123, methylated on Arg-13, and acetylated on Lys-72. These modifications change the activities of the protein as well as its subcellular localization. As stated, S-HDAg is required for RNA replication. L-HDAg can be isoprenylated on a cysteine four residues from the C terminus that is therefore not present in S-HDAg. L-HDAg suppresses RNA replication and leads to a shift from replication of RNA to encapsidation of RNA into progeny virions. It is specifically required for virus assembly, and isoprenylation is required for this activity. A map of functional domains of the L-and S-HDAgs is shown in Fig. 9 .8B.",

Budding appears to be the same as for HBV (Chapter 6), and the three surface antigens of HBV form the protein component of the outer envelope surrounding the HDV capsid.

The name comes from the tendency of animals to rub themselves against upright posts, apparently because of intense itching that arises from this neurological disease. Scrapie appears to be transmitted horizontally in sheep flocks, but the mechanism by which it is transmitted is not understood. The infectious agent is very resistant to inactivation and may persist in pastures for a long time. It may be ingested, but other mechanisms for persistence have also been proposed. Scrapie appears to have been transmitted to a number of other mammals. In some cases the spread has been to animals that share pasturage with infected sheep, such as white-tailed deer, mule deer, and elk (where the disease is called chronic wasting disease). In these cases, it is thought that infection occurs by the same mechanisms that maintain scrapie in sheep flocks. In other cases, spread has occurred via food derived from infected sheep that was fed to mink (transmissible mink encephalopathy), domestic cats or exotic cats in zoos (feline spongiform encephalopathy), ungulates in zoos (exotic ungulate encephalopathy), and perhaps to cattle. However, there is no evidence that scrapie has ever spread to humans, despite the long history of human consumption of scrapie-infected sheep.",

These initial bans were subsequently enlarged and extended in various ways (see Fig. 9 .12 and its legend). The ruminant feed ban resulted in the waning of the epidemic in cattle in Britain, but new cases continued to arise, whether the result of a long latent period of the infectious agent, or from contaminated ruminant feed that continued to enter the system, or from alternative modes of transmission, such as passing the infection from mother to calf. With the recognition of new variant CJD in people, the issue of eradicating BSE became more pressing and culling of cattle was undertaken. This culling of herds containing BSE-infected cattle together with the subsequent culling of herds infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus, as well as the continued enforcement of the ruminant feed bans, have resulted in a marked reduction in the incidence of BSE, although not to its total eradication ( Fig. 9.12 ).",

A comparison of the ages at which people in Britain contracted sporadic CJD during the last 25 years with that of the ages of the first 21 cases of nvCJD is shown in Fig. 9 .13A. Sporadic CJD is primarily a disease of people in their 50s, 60s, and 70s, with a peak of occurrence in the early 60s. Cases in people under 40 are rare. Variant CJD to date has been a disease of young people, primarily people in their teens, 20s, and early 30s. Symptomology also differs. Sporadic CJD is characterized by dementia as an early symptom, whereas variant CJD Anderson et al. (1996). is characterized by psychiatric symptoms, usually depression, and the patient is often first seen by a psychiatrist. Third, time to death averages somewhat longer in variant CJD than in sporadic CJD. The number of cases of nvCJD rose for several years, plateaued in the year 2000, and then declined, as shown in Fig. 9 .13B. Also shown in this figure for comparison are the number of cases of sporadic CJD each year in Britain; the rise in the number of cases of sporadic CJD reported over this time frame is probably due to increased recognition of CJD disease, catalyzed in part by the nvCJD epidemic. Through 2005 there had been a total of about 150 cases of nvCJD.",

For another, the nvCJD epidemic closely parallels the BSE epidemic with an 8year lag. It appears, therefore, that the incubation period of nvCJD, at least to date, averages about 8 years. It is not clear how many cases may ultimately arise. As described earlier, kuru has a long latent period, with disease developing as long as 40 years after infection. The decline in the incidence of nvCJD following control of BSE, however, suggests that the dynamics of nvCJD disease are different and that only small numbers of disease will continue to arise, perhaps the result of the species barrier that exists for the transmission of BSE to humans. Further, it is not understood why the young are so much more sensitive to nvCJD than are the old.

The subsequent discovery that many TSEs could be transmitted to mice and hamsters, in which the incubation period was much shorter, as short as 60 days in some instances, speeded up progress. Transgenic mice, in particular, have been very useful because the genetic background can be controlled. However, such studies remain slow and tedious because an infectivity assay often takes more than 1 year. Studies in mice and other animals, as well as the finding that mutations in the prion protein are associated with inherited TSEs in humans, have made clear that the prion protein, abbreviated PrP, is intimately involved in the transmission of TSE and in the disease process.

There is very little nucleic acid in infectious preparations of PrP Sc . In particular, there is no homogeneous DNA or RNA molecule that might arise from a virus, for example. This has led to the hypothesis that PrP Sc is itself the infectious agent. In this model, \"infectious\" PrP Sc induces PrP c to assume the PrP Sc conformation, and the accumulation of PrP Sc in the brain leads to the pathology associated with TSEs. Most of the experimental data are compatible with such a model. PrP Sc does induce PrP c to assume the PrP Sc conformation, as described earlier. Mutations in PrP c could make it easier for the protein to assume the PrP Sc conformation, compatible with the observation that some mutations result in inheritance of TSEs. The species barrier could result from lowered interaction affinities between proteins of different sequence. However, it has not been possible to prove this hypothesis. PrP Sc preparations have a very low specific infectivity, with at least 10 5 molecules of PrP Sc required for infection. Thus it remains possible that contaminants in the preparation might be required for infectivity. It has not been possible to demonstrate an increase in infectivity associated with the conversion of PrP c to PrP Sc , as described before, which would provide solid evidence that PrP Sc is infectious.",

One of the major criticisms of the protein-only hypothesis is the fact that as many as 20 different strains of scrapie exist as assayed in mice. These strains of scrapie differ in properties such as the length of the incubation period following infection before disease becomes apparent, the areas of the brain affected, and the symptoms of the disease, but these properties do not vary within a strain. Such properties are expected for an infectious entity with a nucleic acid genome, but are difficult to reconcile with the properties of an infectious protein. If the proteinonly hypothesis is true, these differences in properties could only result from differences in the conformation of PrP Sc in the different strains. How is it that a single, fairly small protein can take up so many different conformations and that each can induce the production of more protein having the same conformation?",

The PrP Sc from the two strains, isolated from infected brain, are differently truncated at the amino terminus on treatment with proteases in vitro. Thus the conformations of the PrP Sc in these two strains, both derived from hamster PrP, must be different. Furthermore, this difference can be reproduced in an in vitro reaction in which PrP c is mixed with the two different types of PrP Sc . Each type of PrP Sc induces PrP c to assume its own distinct conformation, as shown by the protease resistant fragment that is produced from the PrP c on it conversion to PrP Sc .",

This problem has been addressed in studies that ascertain in which tissues PrP Sc is present following ingestion of PrP Sc , and studies with transgenic mice that express PrP only in certain tissues. These various studies are compatible with a model in which infectivity is transported via axons following direct neuroinvasion of peripheral nerves. In the case of infection with only low doses of infectious material, amplification in follicular dendritic cells in lymphoid tissue may be required before neuroinvasion occurs. Thus, in terms of the protein-only model, PrP Sc might induce the conversion of PrP c to PrP Sc in cells in Peyer's patches, which then spreads via lymphatic tissue to peripheral nerves by sequential conversion of PrP.",

Current models propose that the conformational change resulting in PrP Sc occurs rarely, but that once PrP Sc is formed, it acts as a seed to induce the formation of more PrP Sc . Two models to explain the conversion of PrP c to PrP Sc by PrP Sc have been proposed. In one, PrP Sc (which may be present in an aggregate) and PrP c form a complex, and the PrP Sc induces the conformational change in PrP c . In the second model, PrP c undergoes spontaneous transitions to different conformational states that are short lived and revert quickly to the native PrP c conformational state. These conformational variants, however, can be locked into place by interaction with PrP Sc . In either case, the altered PrP joins the aggregated PrP Sc to form a larger aggregate. Since the aggregated PrP Sc is insoluble, the reaction is essentially irreversible. Such a process could also explain the species barrier. The PrP proteins of different animals differ slightly in sequence. PrP c that is identical in sequence to the PrP Sc seed could interact with such a seed more readily than with a PrP Sc seed that differs in sequence.",

The effect of mutations in PrP c might be to increase the probability of change to the PrP Sc conformation, with the result that disease occurs more frequently. Such a model is compatible with data for human TSEs, where sporadic CJD occurs, albeit infrequently. However, sporadic disease has not been seen in shorter-lived animals.

Thus simple neurotoxicity of PrP Sc is not the cause of neuronal death. However, it is possible that conversion of PrP c to PrP Sc at the surface of the cell, which is known to occur, followed by accumulation of PrP Sc in lysosomes as the neuron attempts to recycle it, could be toxic.

Preliminary data suggest that this form of PrP is neurotoxic: Ctm PrP has been found in brains of animals, including humans, suffering from TSE but not in normal brains. This has led to a model in which Ctm PrP is regularly produced at some frequency, but the normal cell has a mechanism to eliminate it. Overproduction of Ctm PrP, either by mutation or by a failure to eliminate it, leads to the symptoms of TSE. In this model, production of PrP Sc might somehow result in the accumulation of Ctm PrP, perhaps by overwhelming the ability of the cell to eliminate it.",

The [PSI] state is dominant and can be transmitted to other yeast cells by transfer of cytoplasm containing [PSI] . Thus, the prion state induces the normal cell protein to assume the prion state, as with the model for PrP Sc . The effect of the [PSI] state on the cell is to render Sup35p nonfunctional, and thus has the same effect as deletion of the gene encoding the protein. Loss of Sup35p activity leads to increased readthrough of stop codons during translation, and renders nonsense suppressor tRNAs much more active. [URE3] is the prion state of Ure2p, a protein involved in nitrogen catabolism. Like [PSI], [URE3] is an aggregated form of a conformational variant of Ure2p, and is dominant and transmissible. Loss of Ure2p by the cell affects the metabolism of nitrogen. Normal cells can assume the prion state with a low frequency, but once assumed the prion state is retained. Cells in the prion state can be cured by certain treatments that break up the protein aggregates and cause the protein to assume a normal conformation. Studies of yeast prions have shown that Sup35p produced in bacterial cells can be converted to [PSI] in vitro by introduction of a small seed of [PSI] . The [PSI] produced in vitro can be used in turn to convert more Sup35p to [PSI] . The [PSI] produced in vitro is infectious-when introduced into yeast it induces the assumption of the prion state. Thus, these studies clearly show that yeast prions are infectious and that only protein is required for infectivity, providing further support for the protein-only hypothesis of mammalian TSEs.",
