To characterize polyadenylation activity in the BaMV replicase complex, we performed the in vitro polyadenylation with various BaMV templates. We conducted a polyadenylation activity assay for BaMV RNA by using a partially purified BaMV replicase complex. The results showed that approximately 200 adenylates at the 3\u2032 end of the RNA were generated on the endogenous RNA templates. Specific fractions derived from uninfected Nicotiana benthamiana plants enhanced the polyadenylation activity, implying that host factors are involved in polyadenylation. Furthermore, polyadenylation can be detected in newly synthesized plus-strand RNA in vitro when using the exogenous BaMV minus-strand minigenome. For polyadenylation on the exogenous plus-strand minigenome, the 3\u2032 end requires at least 4A to reach 22% polyadenylation activity. The results indicate that the BaMV replicase complex recognizes the 3\u2032 end of BaMV for polyadenylation.",

In contrast, poly(A) tails play an important role in mRNA translation and turnover (Proudfoot, 2011; Sachs and Wahle, 1993; Weill et al., 2012) and the movement of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in eukaryotes (Huang and Carmichael, 1996; Millevoi and Vagner, 2010) . For positive-sense RNA viruses, poly(A) tails have been implicated in RNA stability, translation (Bergamini et al., 2000) , and replication (Guilford et al., 1991; Tsai et al., 1999) . A positive correlation between the length of the poly (A)-tail and virus infectivity has been reported for several viruses including BaMV , White clover mosaic virus (Guilford et al., 1991) , poliovirus (Sarnow, 1989) and Cowpea mosaic virus (Eggen et al., 1989) . Furthermore, the 3\u2032 poly(A) sequences of several positive-sense RNA viruses, such as bovine coronavirus (Spagnolo and Hogue, 2000) and BaMV (Lin et al., 2007) , interact with the host proteins required for viral RNA replication.",

RNA r138/10A contained the BaMV 3\u2032 UTR with 10 adenylates at the 3\u2032 end, whereas r138/10A/\u0394bulge and r138/10A/\u0394IL were r138/10A with a bulge and an internal loop deletion, respectively, ( Fig. 4) . The effects of the 3 RNA molecules on polyadenylation activity were evaluated in the in vitro replication assay. The results showed that the signal intensity of polyadenylation was largely unaffected by the addition of RNA in which the conserved AAUAAA sequence was deleted (r138/10A/\u0394IL) (Fig. 4C , lane 2), but reduced and shortened in size by the RNA containing the AAUAAA motif (r138/10A and r138/10A/ \u0394bulge) (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4) .

However, the polyadenylation enzyme complex could return to the template and copy the G 3 sequence during polyadenylation. This could be due to the enzyme copying slippage, although the cloning artifact could not be disregarded. Overall, the results indicate that polyadenylation began before the replication enzyme complex reached the GGG sequence and that BaMV RNA replication was accompanied by an exonuclease activity in which the C 3 sequence was removed before the poly (A) tail was added.

Because BSM13 is a suitable template for minus-strand RNA synthesis, the in vitro reaction could be more efficient in RNA replication than in polyadenylation. To exclude minus-strand RNA synthesis from the reaction, we included only ATP and GTP in the RdRp assay. To test the requirements of the 3\u2032 end structure for polyadenylation, we used the RNA transcripts derived from PCR products to obtain the precise sequence instead of using run-off transcripts, which contain a nonviral sequence (the EcoRI site). BSM13/noA, \u2212/4A, \u2212/7A, and \u2212/13A templates were prepared and incubated with the BaMV replicase complex, and ATP and GTP were included in the reaction. The reaction products were examined using a head-to-tail ligation and RT-PCR analysis (Wu and Brian, 2010) instead of 3\u2032 RACE in which the primer (dT 20 ) might cover the authentic 3\u2032-end sequence. The sequence results indicate that no adenylate can be added to the template without a preexisting adenylate (Table 1 , BSM13/noA). Long preexisting adenylates at the very 3\u2032 end of the template (with 4, 7, and 13 As) cause efficient for polyadenylation (22%, 46%, and 68%, respectively). The results indicate that the partially purified BaMV replicase complex is capable of polyadenylating the preformed exogenous RNA templates.

Compared with the untreated BaMV replicase complex preparation, the NP40-treated preparation resulted in enhanced poly(A) signal intensity in the products of the in vitro RNA replication assay (Fig. 1B) . This was probably due to particular conformational changes or subunit rearrangements in the enzyme complex induced by the detergent NP40. Numerous studies have not connected the BaMV infection cycle with the nucleus. Therefore, it is unlikely that the addition of the poly(A) tail to the BaMV genome during its replication cycle is processed by the nuclear polyadenylation machinery of the host cell. Plants encode enzymes, such as nucleotidyltransferase and polynucleotide phosphorylase, for the RNA polyadenylation involved in the poly(A)-stimulated RNA degradation pathway in mitochondria and chloroplasts (Lange et al., 2009; Zimmer et al., 2009) .

In contrast, incubating exogenous plus-strand RNAs with the BaMV replicase complex does not lead to the polyadenylation of BSM13/noA RNA (Table 1) , but leads to a minimal activity of approximately 22% for BSM13/4A RNA.

Approximately 9 adenylates are added to the 3\u2032 end of the RNA containing a conserved AAUAAA sequence during the first phase. Subsequently, independent of the AAUAAA motif and the associated factors, the polyadenylation complex extends efficiently from the short oligo(A) to generate a full-length poly(A) tail (approximately 200 adenylates) (Sheets and Wickens, 1989) . In general, the polyadenylation process of BaMV plus-strand RNA is similar to that of eukaryotic mRNA. These similarities include the requirements of the AAUAAA motif (Chen et al., 2005) , the synthesis of a short oligo(A) (derived from the minusstrand template), and the synthesis of a poly(A) tail of a similar length. BaMV minus-strand RNA synthesis was shown to initiate between the seventh to tenth adenylate abutting the 3\u2032 UTR on plus-strand RNA (Cheng et al., 2002) , leading to the presence of a few uridylates at the 5\u2032 end of the minus-strand RNA. These uridylates in minus-strand RNA could serve as the template for the first few adenylates of the poly(A) tail on plus-strand RNA. These adenylates could be used as the primer for the synthesis of up to 300 adenylates (Chen et al., 2005) . Moreover, mutation of the AAUAAA sequence in the BaMV system led to poly(A) tails of a shorter length (Chen et al., 2005) , indicating that the polyadenylation complex of the BaMV replication machinery is associated with the AAUAAA motif during the tailing process.",

Subsequently, BF4 and 5 were pooled together and supplemented with fractions from uninfected plants to test whether host proteins are involved in polyadenylating BaMV RNA. Soluble fraction (HS30) and NP40solubilized membrane fractions (healthy fraction; HF1 to HF10) of uninfected N. benthamiana plants were added to BF4-5 to test their effects on polyadenylation activity ([\u03b1-32 P] ATP labeling;Fig. 3B, top panel) and RdRp activity ([\u03b1-32 P] UTP labeling;Fig. 3B, bottom panel) using endogenous RNA templates. Compared with standard BF4-5(Fig. 3B, lane 2), BF4-5 supplemented with HS30 and HF1 were shown elevated polyadenylation but not RdRp activity(Fig. 3B, lane 1 and 3, respectively).
