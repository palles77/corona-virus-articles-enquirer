The source of the illness was unknown and there was no identified cure or effective course of treatment. A series of events, largely driven by errors in diagnoses, bad luck, and unexplained events of 'super spreading,' led to an outbreak of SARS in the Greater Toronto area. Although Canadian officials struggled to contain the mysterious disease, 438 SARS cases were identified in Canada with 224 occurring in Toronto. 1 Of these cases, 44 resulted in death. 2 SARS appeared to spread rapidly, leaving public health and medical officials in Toronto faced with an urgent need to control the outbreak as quickly as possible. In the absence of a clear and effective course of interventional medical treatment, quarantine was used to stop the spread of infection. Despite the antiquity and known effectiveness of quarantine as a means to halt disease, little research has been done to estimate its cost. Such cost-benefit analysis is critical as health authorities evaluate the efficacy of quarantine in the event of another outbreak of highly infectious disease.",

Healthcare officials often turn to quarantine in the early days of an epidemic, when the infectious agent remains unknown, and when vaccines, antibiotics, and anti-viral drugs are either useless or of little known utility. Even if prophylaxis or treatments were effective, they would likely be in short supply 5 . Because of these obstacles, which limit the effectiveness of modern medicine, quarantine is a useful infection containment mechanism in the early days of an outbreak.",

When SARS first emerged in China, it was thought to be little more than a severe strain of influenza. Eventually this diagnosis was changed to that of 'atypical' pneumonia. Even as more patients sought medical care for fever associated with shortness of breath, no definitive diagnosis was made. Then SARS spread across the world to Scarborough Grace hospital in Toronto. There, the staff was relatively unprepared for such a virulent virus, and SARS spread throughout the city. In the coming months, the virus had a severe impact on both the Canadian health system and economy. The outbreaks of this mysterious disease led to public fear and panic since no one understood the cause of SARS or the method or degree of transmission. The only effective mechanism for containment was quarantine.",

Similarly, spouses and family members of infected individuals have a higher incidence of disease versus casual contacts. The rate of transmission is also affected by whether or not a SARS patient is a 'super spreader.' This unexplained phenomenon occurs when one infected individual is responsible for spreading the virus to a large number of people. It is impossible to identify super spreaders until observation and contact tracing is done retrospectively, but these individuals were responsible for the large clusters of outbreaks in Toronto. During the Toronto outbreaks, one super spreader infected as many as 32 people. 7 To account for the variability of transmission in our model, we represented the efficiency of transmission as a variable, a.

This yields an average of $30 702 lost per life year per worker. Therefore, mortality related to SARS results in a loss of productivity valued at approximately $460 530 per life lost. Although these calculations assume that each individual would work until they were 71-which may not be realistic-they also do not adjust upward for the disproportionate economic productivity of the healthcare workers who died as a result of SARS.

Because of the ongoing threat of newly emerging infectious disease and bioterrorism, increased attention and resources are being devoted to public health infrastructure and interventions. This is largely because, in the face of an epidemic of highly transmittable infectious disease, modern medicine would be of limited effectiveness if the virus remains unknown as SARS did in its early days. Antiviral drugs and antibiotics would be of little use, and initially, vaccines and prophylaxis would unavailable. The simplest and most effective tool is quarantine. We acknowledge that it is unlikely that no widespread public health intervention would be taken to contain an epidemic, and our comparisons may seem extreme. However, these two scenarios serve to illustrate what occurred in the early days of the SARS outbreaks in Toronto. Had SARS been identified in the index patient, or even the primary or secondary infections, the city may have been spared the enormous economic burden of disease that descended upon them in 2003.
