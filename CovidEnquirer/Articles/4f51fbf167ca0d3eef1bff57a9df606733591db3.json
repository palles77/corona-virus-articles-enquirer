Jejunum from infected animals, as compared with control jejunum, had decreased mucosal-toserosal, serosal-to-mucosal, and net Na' and Cl fluxes. Clonidine and verapamil caused a decrease in short-circuit current and stimulation of Na' and Cl-absorption in control jejunum. In infected piglets, although the jejunum exhibited severe villus atrophy, both drugs stimulated Na' and Cl-ahsorption and the magnitude of Na' and Cl-absorption was similar in control and transmissihle-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. In contrast, n-glucose stimulated Na' absorption, and the decrease in shortcircuit current caused by verapamil and clonidine, were decreased in transmissihle-gastroenteritisinfected jejunum. Such pharmacological stimulation of Na' and Cl-absorption might he useful in the management and treatment of certain viral diar-rhea1 diseases.",

In general, viral enteric infections are self-limiting. Enteric viruses appear to selectively affect the mature enterocytes lining the upper portion of the intestinal villi. Viral replication in these mature enterocytes leads to premature sloughing of infected enterocytes with resulting villus atrophy (2,3), malabsorption, and disordered electrolyte transport due to the lack of a functional epithelium involved in digestion and absorption of nutrients. There may also be an increase in secretory function caused by an increase in the number of immature enterocytes and crypt epithelium hyperplasia (24). The mortality associated with viral gastroenteritis is for the most part caused by severe water and electrolyte loss, rather than by any irreversible intestinal tissue damage.",

The major transport measurement reported in this paper is the Isc, which is equivalent to the electrical sum of all electrogenic ion transport processes occurring simultaneously. Unidirectional fluxes of \"Na and %l were also measured 20-100 minutes after the addition of isotopes on tissues matched to differ in conductance by not more than 25%. In these experiments two 20 minute flux periods were measured before the addition of any drug, then verapamii or clonidine were added to the serosal side and three 20 minute flux periods were determined. Fluxes from untreated tissue were also measured for time controls. The effects of the two drugs were evaluated in both normal (n = 5) and virus-infected piglets (n = 4 for studying the effects of verapamil and n = 5 for clonidine). Nine of the 10 animals studied were paired with respect to the two drug treatments.

            "text": "The search for antisecretory drugs for the therapeutic management of bacterial diarrheas mediated by enterotoxins, particularly cholera, has gained attention during recent years (18). This has not been the case to the same extent with viral diarrhea1 diseases in which electrolyte and water disturbances are not thought to be associated with enterotoxins, but rather with the loss of mature absorptive enterocytes and their replacement by immature cryptlike cells (2-4). Approaches for the potential treatment of neonatal intestinal viral infections have followed immunological and nonimmunological lines, the latter including the use of protease inhibitors or glycoproteins blockers (19). The TGE virus is known to infect the mature enterocytes lining the intestinal villi of jejunum and ileum of young piglets. After infected enterocytes are shed, they are replaced by cells migrating from the crypts at an accelerated rate (2, 3, 20, 21) . Davidson et al (22) have suggested that the defective epithelial function after human rotavirus infection is primarily caused by retarded differentiation of the uninfected migrating enterocytes. These enterocytes, isolated from atrophied villi during acute diarrhea, had an enzymatic profile typical of crypt cells, being rich in thymidine kinase and low in sucrase activities. The current study examines several aspects of the Na' absorptive processes in the jejunum of TGE-infected animals. Mucosal-to-serosal Na' and Cl fluxes (Tables 1 and 2), serosal-to-mucosal Na' and Cl fluxes and net Na' and Cl fluxes as well as glucosedependent Na' absorption were all decreased in jejunum from TGE-virus-infected animals. It was found previously (7-ll), that verapamil and clonidine increase Na' and Cl absorption in rabbit ileum. In the present study, verapamil and clonidine not only stimulated Na' and Cl-absorption in the jejunum of normal piglets, but also in the jejunum of TGE-virus-infected piglets. Surprisingly, the magnitudes of the verapamil-and clonidine-induced increases in Na' and Cl-absorption were similar in normal and virus-infected jejunum. These data are notable because it has been thought that the luminal membrane NaCl cotransport system may be absent in piglet jejunum after infection with TGE virus (23). The evidence for this was the lack of 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP)-mediated or furosemidemediated antiabsorptive effects. One possible explanation for the discrepancy may lie in the fact that our results demonstrate stimulation of absorption, and such stimulation may be necessary before antiabsorptive effects can occur. Alternatively, the piglets used in the two studies differed considerably in age (4-7 days vs. 17 days).",

This defect in Na-Dglucose transport was confirmed in the current study in which n-glucose-stimulated Na' absorption was markedly reduced in TGE-infected tissue when compared with normal tissue. Oral rehydration therapy is effectively used in the treatment of viral diarrhea1 diseases in children, further confirming that the defect in glucose-dependent Na' transport is only partial (26,27). Thus, these different Na' absorptive processes, which are present in small intestinal Na' absorbing epithelial cells, were affected differently in TGE-infected jejunum. n-glucose carriers have been shown, with antibodies raised to the purified Na-Dglucose carrier, to be present predominantly in the villus tips, whereas the location at which neutral NaCl absorption takes place is unknown. These results are consistent with neutral NaCl absorption being present throughout the villi, whereas the Na-Dglucose transporter is found predominantly in the villus tips, the site of the most severe histological damage in TGE diarrhea.",

Which of these possibilities is correct awaits identification of the location of the neutral NaCl absorptive process. Earlier studies in somewhat older piglets have shown that at the height of diarrhea, the GASTROENTEROLOGY Vol. 101, No. 4 epithelium consists predominantly of immature cells that have migrated to the villi in a relatively undifferentiated state (21,23,24). As mentioned earlier, these cells were not able to generate CAMP-mediated or furosemide-mediated antiabsorptive effects, but only serve as the site for CAMP-mediated anion secretion, suggesting the absence of neutral NaCl cotransporters in these cells. The mucosa of the infected tissue was shown to be composed of cells closely resembling those occurring in normal crypts, in that they have similar enzyme activities (23). In addition to the effects on Na' absorption, another transport process was significantly affected in TGE-infected jejunum. The process is that represented by the verapamil-and clonidine-induced decrease in Isc. Initially, it was thought that this process represented inhibition of bicarbonate secretion; however, it has recently become obvious that a decrease in Isc in this setting can represent several transport processes involved in hydrogen ion transport (28). These current studies do not shed light on the nature of this transport process but do suggest that whatever that process, it is probably localized to the same cells which are responsible for D-glucose-stimulated Na' absorption and are likely to be the jejunal villus tip cells.",
