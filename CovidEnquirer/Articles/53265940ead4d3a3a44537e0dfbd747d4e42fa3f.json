OVA-sHsp conjugation efficiency was dependent upon the stoichiometry and the length of the small molecule linker utilized, and the attachment position on the sHsp cage. When conjugated OVA-sHsp was delivered intranasally to na\u00efve mice, the resulting immune response to OVA was accelerated and intensified, and OVA-specific IgG1 responses were apparent within 5 days after a single immunizing dose, illustrating its utility for vaccine development. If animals were pretreated with a disparate VLP, P22 (a non-replicative bacteriophage capsid), before OVA-sHsp conjugate immunization, OVA-specific IgG1 responses were apparent already by 4 days after a single immunizing dose of conjugate in OVA-na\u00efve mice. Additionally, the mice pretreated with P22 produced high titer mucosal IgA, and isotype-switched OVA-specific serum IgG. Similarly, sHsp pretreatment enhanced the accumulation of lung germinal center B cells, T follicular helper cells, and increased polymeric Ig receptor expression, priming the lungs for subsequent IgG and IgA responses to influenza virus challenge. Thus, sHsp nanoparticles elicited quick and intense antibody responses and these accelerated responses could similarly be induced to antigen chemically conjugated to the sHsp. Pretreatment of mice with P22 further accelerated the onset of the antibody response to OVA-sHsp, demonstrating the utility of conjugating antigens to VLPs for pre-, or possibly post-exposure prophylaxis of lung, all without the need for adjuvant.",

Unfortunately, we are currently unable to provide vaccines against many clinically relevant lower respiratory tract pathogens, nor are we able to fully predict the identity of future outbreaks. This global vulnerability has been clearly illustrated by several epidemics in recent memory, including the newly emerged coronavirus, SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002, various influenza strain reassortments (H5N1 \"bird flu\" and H1N1pandemic), and bioterrorism events involving pathogen aerosolization. Thus, there is an urgent and crucial need for the development of broad-spectrum, rapidly acting vaccination strategies.",

            "text": "Unlike most other mucosal sites in the body, which are protected and immunologically shaped by their commensal microbial communities, the lung is more or less sterile. Therefore, the lung relies on an intricate network of sentinel dendritic cells, antimicrobial secretions, and resident macrophages for defense. Importantly, immune responses in the lung must be tightly regulated to promote immunity, while avoiding tissue damage associated with either the pathogen or the host response. As such, pulmonary immune responses are quite unique, and as suggested by others, the individual history of specific pathogen exposures to the lungs may contribute to shaping the appropriate ensuing immune responses to subsequent challenges [1] [2] [3] [4] . Here (and elsewhere [5] ), we further demonstrate that virus-like particles (VLPs), which are unrelated to the antigen of subsequent challenge, can similarly impact the lung microenvironment, without the associated pathology, thereby shaping future immune responses. Many groups have previously suggested that the lung may provide an important route of delivery for mucosal vaccination [6] [7] [8] . However, the potential for utilizing localized mucosal vaccination strategies in the lower respiratory tract have historically been overlooked, and approaches which elicit tissue-specific immune responses are just beginning to be developed. An FDA-approved tribute to the realization of this strategy is the highly effective Flumist vaccine, which is delivered intranasally, and provides better comprehensive local immunity than injectable versions [9] [10] [11] .",

Here, we describe a mechanism by which we can enhance primary local immune responses to antigens without the necessity of specific antigen priming. We achieved this result by intranasally delivering empty virus-like particles (VLPs), which act to modulate the lung microenvironment, and harness and focus immune responses. Recent exploration in the utilization of nanoparticles [12] [13] [14] , virus-like particles [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , and viruses which have no mammalian cell tropism, has shown that these platforms are naturally immunostimulatory, and likely utilize evolutionarily conserved cell surface receptors, thereby safely engaging immune signaling pathways without replicating [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Furthermore, many of these strategies are currently on the market or undergoing clinical trials, and have already had broad global impact in safely preventing disease [21, [27] [28] [29] . Importantly, viruslike particles can be produced in large quantities, provide a stable product, often are amenable to lyophilization or freeze-drying, and are fiscally economical. These features are especially important for less industrialized nations.",

The small heat shock protein 16.5 (sHsp) from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (a hyperthermophilic archaeon) is comprised of 24 repeating subunits [30, 31] . These subunits self-assemble to produce an empty cage-like structure, comparable to that of a virus capsid by virtue of the high symmetry and quaternary structure [5, [32] [33] [34] . We have previously shown that sHsp can be genetically engineered to incorporate cysteine residues, thereby providing attachment sites for bioconjugation [33, 35, 36] , which we exploit here for the display of a foreign protein, similarly to described strategies [37, 38] . P22 is a bacteriophage capsid which infects Salmonella typhimurium (when intact tail fibers are present) [39, 40] . The P22 used here is devoid of both genetic material and tail fibers, and is therefore composed of only the non-infectious empty viral capsid. We would like to note here that previously we have referred to the sHsp nanoparticles as \"protein cage nanoparticles\" or PCN [5] . However, we now find it to be more descriptive to classify both the sHsp and P22 as virus-like particles, given their structural architecture and immunological parallels to other particles described in the literature. Importantly, neither sHsp nor P22 target known mammalian pattern-recognition receptors, nor do they infect mammalian cells. And while the immunomodulatory potential in exploiting non-pathogenic viruses is still in its infancy, others have begun to describe similar successful strategies [24] [25] [26] .",

This immunization strategy is advantageous because it accelerates and intensifies the primary immune response, after only a single dose. We further show that conjugating a model antigen (OVA) to sHsp elicits an immune response to OVA which mirrors the response to the sHsp itself. sHsp conjugation also acts to adjuvant OVA, and the local delivery of sHsp and antigen complexes induce potent local IgA secretion in sHsp pretreated mice. Therefore, we show that VLPs (sHsp and P22) can be used as both immunomodulatory agents by pretreating the lung and/or as a carrier of antigens, allowing local immunization of the lower respiratory tract against a pathogen of interest, with a single dose. This platform could be useful for both pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis.",

In order to remove residual protein contaminants, additional steps were added to the previous protocol. The fractions containing sHsp from size exclusion chromatography were re-concentrated to 10 mL and purified by anion exchange on a Sepharose Q column (GE Healthcare) using a linear gradient from 300 mM to 800 mM NaCl in 25 mM HEPES Buffer at pH 7.3. Following this, the fractions containing sHsp were dialyzed overnight into 50 mM phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA, at pH 7.3, concentrated a third time to 10 mL, and re-subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) with the same buffer. For the S121C sHsp variant protein, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was added to a final concentration of 2 mM during each amicon concentration step prior to the FPLC runs to inhibit disulfide formation between external thiols on sHsp.

In experiments utilizing intranasal pretreatments, 100 g of sHsp (sHspG41C), or P22 were delivered in 50 L volumes while the mice were lightly anesthetized under inhaled 5% isofluorane.

Simultaneously, we determined how pretreatment of the lung with a heterologous VLP, P22, affects the subsequent response to antigen challenge. BALB/c mice were pretreated with either P22 or vehicle (PBS) intranasally (i.n.) in five doses and then allowed to rest for 72 h. Mice were then challenged with OVA conjugated to sHsp (OVA-sHsp), OVA and sHsp separately in solution (OVA-sHsp admixture), OVA alone, or sHsp alone. Serum was then collected at a range of timepoints post-antigen challenge for kinetic analysis. We found that mice which had received the P22 pretreatment, followed by a single dose of the OVA-sHsp conjugate, produced high amounts of OVA-specific serum IgG as early as 4 days post-challenge ( Fig. 2A) . This combination far outperformed any of the other treatment scenarios in both rapidity of antibody production and amount. Interestingly, the next highest antibody producing group, at early timepoints, was those mice that had also been challenged with the single dose OVA-sHsp conjugate, but had been pretreated with vehicle (PBS) only. This group also produced significantly higher antibody titers than the remaining combinations, although the response was delayed by about one day, as compared to those mice which had received P22 pretreatment (P22/OVA-sHsp conjugate). The remaining groups however, did not achieve the same peak titers until day 14 post-challenge, if at all, and equal early responses were delayed by 3-4 days (P22/OVA-sHsp admixture) or more (PBS/OVA-sHsp admixture), as compared to the P22/OVA-sHsp conjugate group.",

Second best at producing high quantities of antibodies were both those mice which had received the control (PBS) pretreatment, but had been challenged with the OVA-sHsp conjugate, and those mice which had been pretreated with P22, then challenged with the sHsp and OVA admixture, which were measurable by day 7 post-challenge. Again, by day 14 post-challenge, the amounts of OVA-specific IgG1 were converging in only those groups in which the sHsp was delivered with OVA. Importantly, two additional conditions further heightened and accelerated the initiation of antibody production-heterologous VLP pretreatment with P22, and the physical conjugation of OVA to sHsp. While we will further discuss the impacts of pretreatment on subsequent challenge, we have demonstrated here that we can elicit an accelerated and intensified immune response to a weak antigen, in a single dose, by covalently conjugating it to sHsp.",

However, we had yet to define the immune response to sHsp itself. Therefore to determine the rate and intensity of the sHsp-specific antibody response we again pretreated mice intranasally with P22, or vehicle. Mice were then rested for 72 h, and challenged with the OVA-sHsp conjugate, the OVA and sHsp admixture, OVA alone, or sHsp alone. We then evaluated the sHsp-specific serum antibody response over 14 days post-challenge (Fig. 3A) . We found that after only one challenge dose, all mice exposed to sHsp generated strong sHsp-specific IgG1 responses, which peaked as early as day 5 post-challenge in mice which had been pretreated with P22. Mice that did not receive P22 pretreatment were again two days delayed in the production of similar amounts of sHsp-specific antibody. However by day 7 post-challenge, all groups (except control OVA-only challenged mice) had generated similar levels of systemic sHsp-specific IgG1 in response to a single intranasal dose of sHsp antigen. Thus, the above-described OVA-specific response (Fig. 2 ) mirrors the accelerated kinetics of the sHsp-specific response, indicating that sHsp facilitates a carrier effect that results in an immune response to OVA that is similar to the response to the sHsp in both onset of antibody production and quantities produced.",

At day 7 postchallenge, we determined the level of OVA-specific serum IgG subclasses, and found that both the conjugated and admixture preparations of OVA elicited high-titer serum antibody O.Ds., while no such response to OVA alone was seen (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly however, the OVA-sHsp conjugate promoted accelerated class-switching to IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 while only IgG1 was significantly detected for the admixture. To further determine the early events of isotype switching, we pretreated mice with either sHsp or vehicle, and challenged with the OVA-sHsp conjugate, or admixture. At days 0, 4, and 6, serum was collected and the OVA-specific IgG subclasses were determined by ELISA. We found that OVA-specific total IgG and IgG1 production was quicker by about two days in mice that had been pretreated with sHsp and challenged with the conjugated OVA-sHsp ( Fig. 4B and C) as compared to the other treatments. The early IgG1 response in this group then translated into an enhanced production of class-switched IgG2a and IgG2b at day 6 post-challenge ( Fig. 4D and E) . This extent of isotype switching was not fully realized in any other group. Interestingly however, the enhanced class-switching capacity appeared to be more dependent upon the structure of the challenge antigen (OVA-sHsp conjugate vs. admixture) than the pretreatment with sHsp. Mice which had received only PBS pretreatment and had been challenged with the OVA-sHsp conjugate generated significantly higher IgG1, 2a, 2b, and IgG3 titers at day 6 post-challenge than those which were challenged with the admixture of sHsp and OVA (Fig. 4C-E and G) . Very little IgG2c was produced at any timepoint (Fig. 4F) . Thus, sHsp acts as an adjuvant when mixed with OVA and acts as a carrier when conjugated to OVA, resulting in unexpectedly potent antibody titers as early as 4 days after a single immunization in na\u00efve mice.",

We subcutaneously (s.c.) injected na\u00efve mice with either the OVA-sHsp conjugate, the OVA and sHsp admixture, OVA alone, or OVA with its classical adjuvant-alum. We then determined the resultant serum antibody responses and found that when conjugated to antigen, sHsp acts as a strong adjuvant to OVA to produce an accelerated OVA-specific antibody response as early as day 5 post-challenge, while OVA-alum responses are delayed by two days comparatively (Fig. 4H) . Again, the OVA and sHsp admixture elicited high titer antibody responses, as did the OVA and alum admixture, however, these combinations required more time to produce similar results. Taken together, sHsp conjugated to antigen acts as a carrier and elicits an accelerated antibody response to that antigen when delivered to several immunologically distinct sites.",

After pre-treatment with sHsp or PBS, and challenge with either the OVA-sHsp conjugate or the admixture, lung lavage fluids contained high levels of mucosal IgA and IgG in only those mice pretreated with sHsp ( Fig. 5A and B) . Local IgG production was further enhanced by the conjugation of sHsp to OVA (Fig. 5B) . Notably, while many of our results demonstrate that the admixed OVA and sHsp preparation does not elicit the same enhancement as the conjugate, here, the admixture is equally potent in initiating mucosal IgA responses (Fig. 5A) . sHsp thus serves a dual role-first as an immunomodulatory agent during pretreatment, and second, as an adjuvant for specific antigens. Furthermore, we found that the pretreatment of the lung with sHsp caused an upregulation of the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) on lung epithelial cell surfaces prior to antigen challenge (Fig. 5C) . Thus, the capacity for the release of local secretory IgA into the airway lumen is enhanced by sHsp pretreatment.",

In both tissues, GC B cells were more prevalent by at least one log in sHsp-primed mice before infection, indicating that the microenvironment within the lung and local lymph node had been stimulated to adjust to the current antigenic exposure. We also found that T follicular helper (T FH ) cells were more abundant in both the lungs and TBLNs of sHsp-primed mice ( Fig. 7C and D) .

Interestingly, we found that in the lung, plasma cells at day 0, assumedly secreting antibody against sHsp, were markedly more abundant in primed mice. However, the number of cells present rapidly declined over the course of the influenza infection, which may represent profound plasticity in the specificity of the inhabitants of GC areas of the lung (as has been described by others) [48] . In the TBLN, plasma cells were again more numerous before infection in the sHsp-primed mice. However, here, they remained elevated as compared to control mice until the resolution of infection, at which point the plasma cell numbers in the TBLNs of both groups converged. Unlike the lung however, similar trends were followed by both groups in the TBLN. We surmise from this data that sHsp-specific plasma cells in the lung are decreasing, while simultaneously, influenza-specific plasma cells are increasing. Therefore, due to the likely variable rates of influx and efflux, we may not have exclusively quantified the rate of increase in influenzaspecific plasma cells due to sHsp priming. What remains puzzling however is how sHsp-specific germinal centers and plasma cells become influenza-or OVA-specific at an accelerated rate when compared to control mice. Given our experimental data, we surmise, as have others [2] , that the pulmonary microenvironment adjusts in the context of innate, humoral, and cellular immune responses in reaction to the menagerie of antigenic exposures encountered, which are unique to that individual. Thus, sHsp pretreatment significantly enhances the efficiency of future immune responses. ",

We demonstrate here that both sHsp pretreatment, and the conjugation of sHsp to an antigen of interest, provided enhanced immunity, by likely distinct immunological mechanisms. Pretreatment with sHsp elicited the organization of GCs in the lungs and TBLNs, which then functioned to accelerate and intensify the onset of antibody production. Most importantly, pre-priming of the lung with sHsp elicited an enhanced mucosal IgA response, and the upregulation of epithelial pIgR. This response is not dependent upon the physical conjugation of OVA to sHsp, as the OVA and sHsp admixture elicited IgA production equally well. For local BALF IgG production, however while sHsp pretreatment seemed to be the factor majorly responsible for the enhanced antibody titers, the conjugation of sHsp to OVA also contributed. Finally, heterologous VLP pretreatment was equally efficient at eliciting heightened immunity, as demonstrated with P22 pretreatment followed by OVA-sHsp challenge, and sHsp pretreatment followed by influenza challenge. While heterologous immunity has been extensively described in both the context of cross-protective immunity, and inappropriate or harmful skewing, the underlying mechanisms are still incompletely defined [1] [2] [3] [48] [49] [50] [51] . We demonstrate here that pretreatment of mice with non-pathogenic VLPs stimulated immunity through some type of priming, which resulted in a subsequent enhanced response to OVA, and furthermore, facilitated pathogen clearance and decreased damage in response to viral challenge (Figs. 5 and 6 and Ref. [5] ).",

In contrast to the conjugation of antigenic peptides to a multivalent scaffold, we present the conjugation of an entire protein antigen to the protein cage surface for in vivo application. Through this approach, it is possible for the conjugated antigen to be seen by the immune system as part of the VLP, and elicits a response similar to that the VLP elicits. As previous work has demonstrated that chemical conjugation efficiency of large unrelated proteins to a viral capsid is inhibited as the size of the protein is increased [38] , conditions for the chemical conjugation of the 45 kDa OVA to the sHsp cage were optimized for these proteins. We observed that the attachment position on the sHsp cage, the length of the chemical linker, and the stoichiometry of linker labeling affected the conjugation efficiency.",

Thus, sHsp acted as a carrier, causing the OVA-specific response to mirror the sHspspecific response in onset of antibody production and quantity produced. Interestingly, while we have utilized sHsp in two scenarios, as a pretreatment, or a vaccine delivery platform, and these scenarios likely are working through distinct immunostimulatory mechanisms, the activities of each are not mutually exclusive, and can in fact, synergize-as the antibody responses to the conjugated OVA-sHsp are enhanced by the pretreatment with either sHsp or P22.",

And as it has been suggested by others, cell surface integrins on antigen-presenting cells likely play a role in recognizing viral capsids [22, 23, 25] . Targeting evolutionarily conserved domains therefore facilitates plasticity in this delivery system, allowing for the utilization of sHsp conjugation with other antigens-especially those which have complicated or precluded the design and manufacture of potent vaccines. Additionally, the complex geometry of the OVA-sHsp conjugate may be impacting the resultant immune responses observed. It has been well demonstrated that the specific geometric display of multivalent antigens significantly heightens immune responses [20, 52, 53] , and especially B cell recognition [52, [54] [55] [56] , and further, that such displays may even provide enough co-stimulation to break tolerance to self-antigens without the need for adjuvants [55, 57] . Thus the arrangement of the OVA-sHsp conjugate may explain the enhanced class-switching which we observed only in those mice which received the conjugated form of OVA-sHsp ( Fig. 4A-G) . We therefore demonstrate the utility in displaying a poorly immunogenic antigen as a multivalent array through the conjugation to a VLP platform to elicit enhanced specific immunity.",

In this regard, new strategies which employ post-exposure prophylaxis represent an arguably greater demand than pretreatment, as we continually lose antibiotic options due to the emergence of resistant strains of bacteria, and are no better at predicting future viral outbreaks. Thus, we may be able to exploit sHsp, conjugated to an antigen of choice, to elicit early IgA responses. Importantly, few adjuvants currently on the market can be safely delivered to the lung, nor do they produce high titer, site-specific mucosal IgA [58] .",

This type of platform is especially noteworthy, as it may be utilized as an immunomodulatory agent alone (as in the case of pretreatments), for modifying the current state of immune homeostasis, or as a carrier and adjuvant for a defined antigen of interest. This phenomenon of immune homeostasis and skewing has been extensively described in terms of an individual's history of pathogen and allergen exposure [3, 51] . However, to date few attempts to harness the potential of immune priming, with or without involving pathogen-specific epitopes or proteins, have been described [4] . Thus, we propose that we have identified an approach which utilizes strategies for priming against undefined broad-spectrum antigens, and also for delivering a highly efficacious single-dose vaccine against a defined antigen. Importantly, we have additionally shown that the route of delivery (directly to the lung by intranasal instillation) results in the creation of an immune response that is specifically tailored to that tissue, and its individual requirements. While concern in purposely eliciting an immune response in the lung is justified, we and others [52] indicate here (and elsewhere [5] ) that by doing so with VLPs, the power of tissue-specific immunity can be harnessed to provide a safe and appropriate response in the context of both the pathogen (sterilizing immunity), and the protection of lung function. Furthermore, the onset of immunity when the lung is pre-exposed to sHsp is accelerated, again indicating that the pretreatment with sHsp impacts the future, unpredictable pathogen challenge. In addition, we have previously shown that the deposition of VLPs in mouse lungs has no adverse effects and even attenuates lung hypersensitivity [5] .",
