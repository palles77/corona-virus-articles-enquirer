            "text": "Targeted recombination was carried out to select mouse hepatitis viruses (MHVs) in a defined genetic background, containing an MHV-JHM spike gene encoding either three heptad repeat 1 (HR1) substitutions (Q1067H, Q1094H, and L1114R) or L1114R alone. The recombinant virus, which expresses spike with the three substitutions, was nonfusogenic at neutral pH. Its replication was significantly inhibited by lysosomotropic agents, and it was highly neuroattenuated in vivo. In contrast, the recombinant expressing spike with L1114R alone mediated cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH and replicated efficiently despite the presence of lysosomotropic agents; however, it still caused only subclinical morbidity and no mortality in animals. Thus, both recombinant viruses were highly attenuated and expressed viral antigen which was restricted to the olfactory bulbs and was markedly absent from other regions of the brains at 5 days postinfection. These data demonstrate that amino acid substitutions, in particular L1114R, within HR1 of the JHM spike reduced the ability of MHV to spread in the central nervous system. Furthermore, the requirements for low pH for fusion and viral entry are not prerequisites for the highly attenuated phenotype.",

            "text": "The spike glycoprotein, found on the virion envelope of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is a major determinant of viral pathogenicity (Phillips et al., 1999) . Entry into susceptible cells and cell-to-cell spread of MHV are mediated by the spike. Spike is synthesized as an 180to 220-kDa glycosylated precursor that is posttranslationally cleaved into two 90-kDa subunits, S1 and S2 (Frana et al., 1985) . Oligomeric spike is present on both viral and infected cell membranes. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike has been mapped to the amino-terminal 330 amino acid residues of the S1 subunit (Kubo et al., 1994) , which is though to form the globular head of the spike. The RBD is responsible for the initial attachment of MHV to the cellsurface receptors, members of the CEACAM subclass of the CEA gene family (Dveksler et al., 1991) . This initial binding event is thought to trigger a conformational change in spike that allows S2, the stalk portion of the peplomer, to initiate fusion of the two membranes (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2002a; Zelus et al., 2003) . A candidate fusion peptide domain has been identified within S2 (Luo and Weiss, 1998; Fig. 1) ; however, the actual fusion peptide for the MHV spike has not been definitively identified. Within S2 there are two heptad repeat (HR) domains (HR1 and HR2) which are structural features common to all coronavirus spikes as well as of attachment/fusion proteins of many other viruses (DeGroot et al., 1987) . More recently, a third heptad repeat region located to the N-terminal side of HR1 was predicted within the MHV spike (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Krueger et al., 2001) . The HR domains are believed to form \u2423-helical configurations, which have been though to play a role in the oligomerization of the spike peplomer (DeGroot et al., 1987; Luo et al., 1999) . It has also been believed that these domains participate in the conformational change of the spike peplomer, which allows for the insertion of the putative fusion peptide into the cell membrane and that interactions between HR1 and RBD may play a role in fusion (Krueger et al., 2001; Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2002b) . However, recently, it has been shown that the S1 subunit contains sequences responsible for oligomerization (Lewicki and Gallagher, 2003) , suggesting that the conformational changes that spike undergoes during the process of fusion may be quite different from previously postulated.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that the wild-type JHM strain (previously referred to as MHV-4; see Materials and methods) can utilize both endosomal and nonendosomal pathways for entry (Nash and Buchmeier, 1997) . Wild-type JHM fuses at neutral pH; however, persistent JHM infection of a neuronal cell line (OBL21a) gave rise to an aciddependent fusion variant OBLV60. OBLV60 is unable to induce fusion at neutral pH and enters cells via the endosomal route (Gallagher et al., 1991; Nash and Buchmeier, 1997) . Sequencing of the spike genes of JHM and OBLV60 demonstrated that there were eight amino acid differences between these two spike proteins. Five of these substitutions were located in the S1 subunit of the spike gene. However, it was demonstrated that the change from neutral pH-induced fusion to low pH-induced fusion was dependent on the amino acid substitutions Q1067H, Q1094H, and L1114R, all within the first heptad repeat (HR1) of the S2 subunit (Gallagher et al., 1991; see Fig. 1) .",

In contrast, the OBLV60 variant is neuroattenuated; infection with OBLV60 is limited mainly to the neurons of the mitral and glomerular layers of the olfactory bulbs, and no fatal encephalitis is observed (Pearce et al., 1994) . We wanted to determine whether the three amino acid substitutions in the HR1 of the OBLV60 spike were responsible for its low pH-dependent route of entry into cells in vitro and/or the attenuation and limited spread of the virus in vivo. It was also important to determine whether these phenotypes could be dissociated from each other. We were particularly interested in the substitution at residue L1114, as this residue has been substituted in viruses with altered phenotypes isolated in several studies (Gallagher et al., 1991; Wang et al., 1992; Saeki et al., 1997) .",

Subsequently we used recombinant viruses expressing chimeric spike proteins to demonstrate that the RBD determines the specificity of receptor utilization (Tsai et al., 2003) . Here we focus on the phenotype of a virus encoding the three HR1 amino acids that were previously shown to be sufficient to result in the low Fig. 1 . Schematic diagram of wild-type and mutant JHM spike proteins. The OBL V60 spike is shown with asterisks marking the positions of the eight amino acid substitutions within the spike (from amino to carboxyl ends-K107R, N134T, L141F, D597N, Q600K, Q1067H, Q1094H, L1114R) (from Gallagher et al., 1991) . Also shown is the JHM spike, with the locations of the cleavage site represented by the vertical line separating the S1 and S2 subunits, as well as the heptad repeat (HR) and transmembrane (TM) domains. The HR1 is enlarged to show the locations of the amino acid substitutions in the mutant proteins containing either three substitutions in HR1 (HR1) or L1114R alone; a candidate fusion peptide (pep1; Luo and Weiss, 1998) within HR1 is also indicated. pH-dependent requirement for cell-to-cell fusion (Gallagher et al., 1991) . Thus, we have selected recombinant viruses with a defined genetic background expressing the JHM spike protein, encoding the amino acid substitutions in HR1 of OBLV60 (Q1067H, Q1094H, and L1114R) or L1114 alone. The three substitutions are sufficient to confer a neuroattenuated phenotype to this recombinant virus, which similar to OBLV60, displays virus spread restricted to the olfactory bulbs. Interestingly the L1114R substitution alone is capable of causing in vivo attenuation and restricted spread, while displaying a fusion phenotype close to wildtype as well as the ability to enter cells at neutral pH.",

As shown in Fig. 3 , SJHM-HR1 lacks the ability to induce cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH. This is consistent with previous data on the inability of OBLV60 to induce cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH (Gallagher et al., 1991) and confirms the observation that the three amino acid substitutions in HR1 (Q1067H, Q1094H, and L1114R) present in both SJHM-HR1 and OBLV60 are sufficient to confer a fusion-negative phenotype at neutral pH. SJHM-L1114R, expressing the L1114R substitution alone, does induce significant levels of cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH; however, fusion induced by this recombinant is less extensive than that induced by SJHM-RA59 (Fig. 3) . Thus, the L1114R substitution is not sufficient to confer the nonfusogenic phenotype of SJHM-HR1. To determine whether, similar to OBLV60, the mutant recombinant viruses rely on the acidification of the endosomal vesicles to trigger fusion, we tested the effects of the lysosomotropic agent, ammonium chloride, on the replication of SJHM-RA59, SJHM-HR1, and SJHM-L1114R in vitro (Fig. 4 ). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which is known to enter cells via the endosomal pathway and to require low pH for entry, was used as a control. In the presence of 20 mM ammonium chloride, the replication of VSV was reduced about 10,000-fold at 12 and 24 h postinfection of L2 cells (Fig. 4) . Similarly, the replication of SJHM-HR1 was reduced more than 1000-fold in the presence of 20 mM ammonium chloride. Similar levels of inhibition were observed for OBLV60 (Gallagher et al., 1991;  our data, not shown). In contrast, only a minimal reduction in replication level was observed when either SJHM-RA59 or SJHM-L1114R infection of L2 cells was carried in the presence of ammonium chloride. (Statistical analysis demonstrated, however, that SJHM-L1114R was inhibited to a greater extent than SJHM-RA59.) Similar patterns of inhibition were observed in infections carried out in the presence of 40 M chloroquine (data not shown). Thus, the L1114R substitution alone does not result in an absolute dependence on low pH for virus entry.",

OBLV60 is a highly neuroattenuated mutant of JHM (Pearce et al., 1994) . To determine whether the three amino acid substitutions in the HR1 of OBLV60 or L1114R alone are sufficient to confer a neuroattenuated phenotype, mice were inoculated either intracranially (ic) or intranasally (in) with serial dilutions of SJHM-RA59, SJHM-HR1, and SJHM-L1114R and observed for disease and death.

In contrast, mice inoculated with doses as low as 1 PFU ic or 1000 PFU in of SJHM-RA59 exhibited clinical signs of disease, such as hunched posture, ruffled fur, and abnormal gait with occasional paralysis, at 4 -5 days postinfection. Thus, recombinant viruses expressing either all three HR1 substitutions or L1114R alone induced clinically silent infections and are basically avirulent. Even L1114R alone is sufficient to highly attenuate MHV.",

We used the in route of inoculation because it is a more natural route and detection of viral antigen following in inoculation is more discreet than following ic inoculation. Thus, mice were inoculated in with 5000 PFU each of SJHM-RA59, SJHM-HR1, or SJHM-L1114R and titers of infectious virus in the brain at various times postinfection were determined by plaque titration. Patterns of infection with all of these viruses were similar in terms of kinetics and extent of replication; viral replication in the brain peaked at 5 days postinfection (Fig. 5 ). SJHM-HR1 displayed slightly higher viral titers at 5 and 7 days postinfection as compared to SJHM-RA59; however, the difference Fig. 4 . Effect of lysosomotropic agents on viral replication in L2 cells. L2 cell monolayers were treated for 1 h with 20 mM ammonium chloride and then infected with either vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or recombinant MHVs expressing wild-type or mutant spikes as indicated. The presence of 20 mM ammonium chloride was continuous throughout the infection. At 0, 12, and 24 h postinfection, the level of infectious titer was measured by plaque assay and expressed as the difference between logarithmic mean (\u232c log 10 (PFU/ml)) titer of the treated and untreated samples (four independent samples per virus). The error bars represent the standard deviations. Four-week-old C57B1/6 mice were inoculated intranasally with 5000 PFU of recombinant viruses expressing wild-type or mutant JHM spikes as indicated. At the indicated times, mice (three per time point) were sacrificed and brains harvested and homogenized. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay of brain homogenates and expressed as the logarithmic mean titer per gram of tissue homogenate. The standard deviations of the mean are plotted as error bars. The limit of detection of this assay was 2.7 log 10 (PFU/g). was less than 1.0 log 10 unit. SJHM-L1114R replicated less efficiently than SJHM-RA59; however, the difference between the titer of infectious virus in the brains of mice infected with these two viruses at 5 days postinfection was not significant (two-tailed t test, P \u03fd 0.06 and P \u03fd 0.11 for each of the two SJHM-L1114R isolates). Thus, although there is a striking difference in virulence after in inoculation with these viruses, this difference cannot be explained by the extent of viral replication in the brains of infected animals.",

Brain sections were obtained from mice infected in with 5000 PFU of SJHM-RA59, SJHM-HR1, and SJHM-L1114R at 5 days postinfection. These sections were labeled with polyclonal antisera directed against MHV structural proteins and then detected using a biotin-avidin-labeled secondary antibody as described under Materials and methods. The difference in the patterns of viral antigen distribution observed in the brains of animals infected with SJHM-RA59 and the viruses expressing mutant spike was striking. The distribution of SJHM-RA59 viral antigen was widespread. Viral antigen was detected in olfactory bulbs, as well as in other regions of the brain, from the basal forebrain to the brain stem (Phillips et al., 1999) . (Fig. 6 shows sections from the basal forebrain and the olfactory bulbs.) However, in mice infected with SJHM-HR1 or SJHM-L1114R, viral antigen was primarily detected in the mitral layer of the olfactory bulbs and in the adjacent glomerular and external plexiform layers (see below). Outside the olfactory bulbs, there were only occasional antigen-positive cells. The majority of antigen-positive cells looked morphologically similar to neurons. Thus, both mutants showed patterns of antigen distribution similar to OBLV60 (Pearce et al., 1994); this Fig. 6 . Viral antigen distribution in the brains of infected mice.

For recombinant virus expressing wild-type JHM spike, approximately equal amounts of infectious virus were detected in the olfactory bulbs and the rest of the brain. Thus, for each virus, the amount of infectious virus present in the olfactory bulb as compared with the rest of the brain is consistent with level of viral antigen detected in each fraction ( Fig. 6 -8) . For all viruses examined, the olfactory bulbs are an abundant source of infectious virus. The olfactory bulbs represent approximately 6% of the weight of the brain, yet even in animals infected with recombinant expressing wild-type spike, olfactory bulbs contain close to half the infectious virus.",

Thus, we used targeted recombination to select viruses in a defined genetic background, differing from the parental virus only in the three mutations in HR1 of S2. These viruses express the JHM spike protein containing the three HR1 substitutions present in the OBLV60 spike (Q1067H, Q1094H, and L1114R). The genes other than the spike in these viruses were derived from MHV-A59. We had shown previously that the parental virus used for comparison for these experiments, SJHM-RA59, which contains the wild-type JHM spike, displays in vitro properties and the high neurovirulence phenotype exhibited by wildtype JHM (Phillips et al., 1999) . We found that the recombinant virus, expressing the JHM spike with HR1 mutations. SJHM-HR1, displays similar phenotypes to OBLV60 (Gallagher et al., 1991; J.C. Tsai and S.R. Weiss, unpublished data). As described above, this includes sensitivity to lysosomotropic agents, inability to induce cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH, as well as in vivo attenuation.

Mice were sacrificed 5 days postinfection and brains were harvested. Olfactory bulbs (OB) were separated from the rest of the brain parenchyma (BP).

We reasoned that this substitution could be responsible for only some of the phenotypes and thus that comparison of SJHM-L1114R with SJHM-HR1 would indicate whether the in vitro changes observed were responsible for and/or linked to the in vivo phenotypes. SJHM-L1114R induced syncytia at neutral pH, albeit at a lower level than SJHM-RA59; furthermore SJHM-L1114R was relatively resistant to the effects of lysosomotropic agents, but not quite as resistant as parental SJHM-RA59. Yet, the SJHM-L1114R viruses were attenuated and displayed antigen only in the olfactory bulbs. This demonstrates that the L1114R substitution is sufficient to cause altered pathogenesis and suggests that the low pH-dependent phenotype displayed by OBLV60 and SJHM-HR1 is not required for neuroattenuation and restricted spread within the CNS.",

            "text": "The HR domains of the MHV spike have been implicated in the mechanism of cell-to-cell fusion (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Krueger et al., 2001; Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2002b) . By analogy with other viral spike proteins, such as HIV gp41 and influenza HA2, it is believed that conformational changes in spike, mediated by intramolecular heptad repeat interactions, are necessary to promote fusion through the insertion of the hydrophobic fusion peptide in the opposing cell's membrane (White, 1992; Carr et al., 1997; Singh et al., 1999) . The three substitutions present in the SJHM-HR1 spike are found within HR1, downstream of the putative fusion peptide (Luo and Weiss, 1998) . We have observed previously that uncharged-to-charged amino acid changes within HR1, such as L to R, can affect the ability of the MHV spike to induce cell-to-cell fusion despite the fact that such spike molecules are processed and delivered to the plasma membrane (Luo and Weiss, 1998) . Gallagher et al. (1991) suggested that the acquisition of a titratable proton and/or positive charge, as a result of the Q-to-H substitutions within the OBLV60 spike HR1, could result in the requirement for a low pH (pH 6) environment for the activation of fusion. However for the OBLV60 spike and the spike proteins studied here, multiple substitutions were necessary for the low pH requirement for fusion; in a vaccinia virus based expression system, neither spike proteins with the L1114R alone nor proteins with both Q-to-H substitutions without L1114R could induce the altered fusion phenotype (Gallagher et al., 1991) . Consistent with this, the L1114R substitution alone results in only a small decrease in the ability to induce cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH and does not confer significant sensitivity to ammonium chloride (Figs. 3 and 4) .",

            "text": "Substitutions at L1114 within the JHM spike (L1114R or L1114F) are particularly intriguing in that they have been reported in association with several mutant phenotypes. In addition to L1114R in the OBLV60 spike (Gallagher et al., 1991) , substitutions at this residue have been identified in the spike of a monoclonal antibody resistant mutant (Wang et al., 1992) and a soluble receptor resistant mutant, srr7 (Saeki et al., 1997) . The srr7 mutant (expressing a spike containing L1114F) demonstrated increased stability of the S1/S2 interaction, the loss of the ability to induce CEACAM-independent fusion (Taguchi and Matsuyama, 2002) , and altered interactions with CEACAM1 b as well as soluble receptor (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2002a, b) . Similarly, OBLV60 exhibits increased thermostability (M. Buchmeier, personal communication) and loss of the ability to induce CEACAM-independent fusion (T. Gallagher, personal communication). The recombinant virus expressing L1114R alone (described in this article) is also unable to induce CEACAM-independent cell-to-cell fusion (data not shown). Finally, recombinant viruses expressing A59/JHM chimeric spikes were also neuroattenuated, thermostable, and unable to induce receptor independent cell-to-cell fusion (Tsai and Weiss, 2001; Tsai et al., 2003) . Thus, these data are consistent with the observation that high thermolability, the ability to induce receptor-independent fusion, and the propensity to dissociate from receptor are associated with high neurovirulence and rapid spread in the CNS and relatively less efficient replication in cultured cells, displayed by JHM (Krueger et al., 2001; Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Phillips et al., 1999) .",

Thus, the titer of infectious virus in the olfactory bulbs represents a large fraction of total virus in the brain and the ability of virus to replicate in the olfactory bulb is sufficient to achieve a high titer.

Alternatively, it is possible that the neurons of the olfactory bulbs are different from other neurons (perhaps, for example, in receptor expression) and that viruses with the L1114R substitution cannot replicate in cells outside the olfactory bulbs. However, this is not an absolute restriction, because at later times postinfection, increased numbers of infected cells are detected outside of olfactory bulbs (data not shown). Consistent with this observation, OBLV60 can spread beyond the olfactory bulbs when the immune response is compromised (Pearce et al., 1994) . Thus, it is likely that the differences in the efficiency of replication between the mutant and the wild-type recombinant viruses in the CNS give the immune response an advantage that restricts spread sooner and more efficiently than for wild-type virus.",

The amplified OBLV60-fragment was digested with BamHI and PstI and a 1166 base pair fragment, encoding the three mutations in HR1 (Q1067H, Q1094H, and L1114R), was subcloned into the corresponding site in pGEM4Z-S4. The resulting plasmid was called pGEM-OBLV60(HRImut). The AvrII/SbfI fragment from this plasmid, containing the mutant spike gene, was subcloned into pMH54-S4 to yield pMH-OBLV60(HR1mut). The spike gene encoded in pMH-OBLV60(HR1mut) was sequenced to verify that the three target mutations, and no additional mutations, were introduced. PCR-mediated mutagenesis to introduce the L1114R substitution was carried out in pG-MHV4S, a derivative of pGEM4Z-S4 that contains the full start signal upstream of the AvrII site. The mutagenic primer JFSL1114R2, which encodes the L1114R substitution (generated by a C-to-T at nucleotide 3340 and a T-to-C at nucleotide 3342 of the spike gene), and JRS-SBF (Table 1) were used to amplify the 3\u0408 end of the S gene. This fragment was digested with HincII and SbfI and subcloned into pG-MHV4S to generate pG-L1114R. After verifying the sequences in the amplified region, the AvrII/SbfI fragment of the spike gene was ligated into pMH54, generating pMH-L1114R.",

The recombinant viruses express the JHM spike with the rest of the background genes derived from A59. Synthetic capped RNAs were synthesized by linearizing the plasmids pMH54-S4, pMH-OBLV60(HR1mut), and pMH-SJHM-L1114R using the restriction enzyme PacI and then transcribing with T7 polymerase (Ambion). Recombination was carried out between the donor RNA and the recipient virus, fMHV in feline FCWF cells (Kuo et al., 2000; Phillips et al., 2001) , and the recombinants selected by their ability to replicate in murine L2 cells; individual isolates were purified by two rounds of plaque purification on L2 cells. Two independently selected recombinant viruses for each mutant were chosen for further study. The pair expressing all three mutations in HR1 were called SJHM-HR1-R120 and SJHM-HR1-R121 and are referred to collectively as SJHM-HR1. The pair expressing L1114R only were called SJHM-L1114R-R300 and SJHM-L1114R-R301 and are referred to collectively as SJHM-L1114R or when data is shown for each isolate as SJHM-L1114R-A and SJHM-L1114R-B, respectively.
