Apart from relatively common vasculitides such as Henoch-Sch} onlein purpura (HSP) and Kawasaki disease (KD), most of the primary vasculitic syndromes are rare in childhood, but with a significant attendant morbidity and mortality. Latest developments in the field of paediatric vasculitis include: a) the recent consensus conference for a new international classification of childhood vasculitides b) the identification of various genetic polymorphisms that may be relevant in terms of disease predisposition or development of disease complications, and c) novel therapeutic approaches including the increasing use of biologics in cases where current standardized first line treatment fails to induce or sustain remission.",

So far there has been much reliance on adult vasculitis classification systems and definitions that are suboptimal for paediatric vasculitides. A recent International Consensus Conference held in Vienna in June 2005 under the auspices of the Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PReS) resulted in a new proposal for childhood vasculitis classification summarised in Table 1 [2]. These criteria are currently being validated and it is anticipated that this will be an important step in providing a ''fit for purpose'' classification system to be used in future epidemiological studies and clinical trials of paediatric vasculitis.",

Serum IgA levels are increased during the acute phase and a proportion of patients have circulating IgA-containing immune complexes and cryoglobulins [6] . Skin or renal biopsies demonstrate the deposition of IgA (mainly IgA1) in the wall of dermal capillaries and post capillary venules and mesangium [6] . Some studies have found IgA antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (IgA-ANCA) in some patients with HSP, whilst others have shown an increase in IgA-rheumatoid factor or IgA-anticardiolipin antibodies [6] . Recently, galactose deficiency of O-linked glycans in the hinge region of IgA1 has been reported in adults with IgA nephropathy and children with HSP [7] . These aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 proteins form immune complexes that deposit in the mesangium; their binding to mesangial cells stimulates cellular proliferation and overexpression of extracellular matrix components resulting in the typical renal lesions associated with HSP and IgA nephropathy [7] .",

Weiss et al performed a meta-analysis based on a comprehensive review of the literature in the Medline database (1956 to January 2007) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register of the . On the basis of reported outcomes among patients with HSP who were treated at diagnosis with corticosteroids compared with patients treated with supportive care only, odds ratios were calculated for the resolution of abdominal pain, the need for surgical intervention secondary to severe pain or intussusception, the likelihood of HSP recurrence, and the development of transient or persistent renal disease. Two of the studies analysed, evaluated prospectively the effect of corticosteroids on abdominal pain duration by using 14 day symptom diaries [18, 19] . In the Huber series a dose of 2 mg/kg/day of prednisolone for 1 week with weaning over weeks 3 and 4 was used [18] . Using median values of total abdominal pain duration, no difference was found between the treatment and the control group. In contrast Ronkainen et al studied 171 patients that were randomised to receive prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks with weaning over the following 2 weeks and reported a significant reduction in the intensity and duration of abdominal pain [19] . There are conflicting results from studies examining the role of pre-emptive corticosteroids to prevent the development of nephritis. At the time of writing this review we suggest that the current consensus opinion is that corticosteroids do not prevent the onset of nephritis, but do have a role for the treatment of severe nephritis should it develop [20] .",

Recurrence of episodes of macroscopic haematuria may occur following upper respiratory tract infections. The prognosis generally remains good unless there is evidence of significant proteinuria [12] . Where isolated haematuria is associated with proteinuria, the risk of long-term renal dysfunction is around 5% [24] . Children presenting with the acute nephritic syndrome have a less favourable outcome, with a long-term risk of CRF of 10-20% [24] . Those with a mixed nephritic-nephrotic presentation have the worst long-term outlook, with up to 33% developing CRF [24] . Those with more aggressive renal biopsy changes are more likely to have a poorer long-term outlook [24] .

Recently cytoplasmic inclusion antibodies were identified in the ciliated bronchial epithelium of children with fatal acute KD, leading the authors of that study to suggest viral infection as the cause of KD [33] .

Irritability is an important sign, which is virtually universally present, although not included as one of the diagnostic criteria [38] . The exact mechanism of the irritability is unclear, but it may be related to the presence of aseptic meningitis. Another clinical sign not incorporated into the diagnostic criteria, but which is relatively specific to KD, is the development of erythema and induration at sites of BCG immunizations [38] . The mechanism of this clinical sign is cross reactivity of T cells in KD patients between specific epitopes of mycobacterial and human heat shock proteins. With an increasing number of infants receiving the BCG in the UK, it is likely that this sign will become more common, and awareness of it could result in earlier diagnosis and treatment [38] .",

Treated with aspirin alone, 20-40% of children develop CAA [39, 40] . Combined therapy with aspirin and high dose IVIG given as a single infusion reduces the occurrence of CAA to 9% at 30 days, and 4% at 60 days after the onset of the illness [39] . The prevalence of CAA is inversely related to the total dose of IVIG [40] , 2 g/kg of IVIG being the optimal dose, usually given as a single infusion [39, 40] . Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing divided lower doses of IVIG (400 mg/kg/day for four consecutive days) versus a single infusion of high dose IVIG (2 g/kg over 10 hours) has clearly shown the therapeutic benefits in the prevention of CAA with the latter regimen [39] . One important practical point, however, is that infants who have cardiac compromise may not be able to tolerate the fluid challenge associated with the high dose single infusion, and consideration of divided doses given over several days may be appropriate for this patient group.",

Not all patients respond to a single dose of IVIG, and some require a second dose. It has been observed that those children who received IVIG very early in the illness may require a second infusion of IVIG for primary treatment failure or disease recrudescence [41] .

In those cases, most advocate the use of corticosteroids, albeit with apparently conflicting data on which to base this practice. Inoue et al showed in a randomized control trial of 178 KD patients that were assigned to receive IVIG, or IVIG plus corticosteroid. The corticosteroid regimen used in that study was prednisolone sodium succinate 2 mg/kg/day, 3 times daily, given by intravenous (IV) injection until the fever resolved and then orally until the C-reactive protein (CRP) level normalized. Once CRP normalized, prednisolone doses were tapered over 15 days. They found that that the addition of corticosteroid reduced CAA: in those receiving conventional treatment 11.4% had CAA at one month, compared with 2.2% in those receiving conventional treatment plus corticosteroids [43] . In contrast Newburger et al in a subsequent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effect of the addition of a single dose of intravenous methylprednisolone to standard therapy [44] . They found that this corticosteroid regimen did not improve the CAA outcome in these children. These contrasting results suggest that dose and duration of corticosteroids may be critical to adjunctive efficacy in KD.",

We are increasingly using rituximab for children with WG that is frequently relapsing or fails to respond initially to conventional induction therapy, and the results are very promising albeit anecdotal [62] . In the paediatric community we have not yet embraced the approach of protocol rituximab therapy every six months (irrespective of peripheral B cell return) for WG, and approach that is beginning to be used in some adult vasculitis treatment protocols.",

Of note, new insight regarding the cause of the disease is provided by a recent study reporting association of functional polymorphism of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate 3-kinase C (ITPKC) gene with immune activation of KD[36]. ITPKC acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation and may contribute to immune hyper-reactivity in KD. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms of immune activation in KD and emphasizes the importance of activated T cells in the pathogenesis of this vasculitis.",
