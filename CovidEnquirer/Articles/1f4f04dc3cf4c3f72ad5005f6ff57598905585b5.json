All ages of swine are susceptible to the disease, however, the mortality is very high in young pigs, especially those younger than one-week old (Jung and Saif, 2015) . Since its first discovery in the late 1970s (Pensaert and De, 1978) , PED has continued to cause severe economic impact in swine industry worldwide. Before 2013, PED was prevalent in Asia and Europe. After the spring of 2013, PED outbreaks reached North America and spread explosively (Stevenson et al., 2013; Mole, 2013) , causing to deaths of 7 million pigs across USA. Then Department of Agriculture of United States issued a Federal Order in June 2014 making swine enteric coronavirus diseases a reportable disease (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis).",

The US MN PEDV strain shared 99.5% identity with China AH2012 strain, but which was not likely a direct source of infection according to genomic and phylogenetic analyses . The emergent US PEDV strain potentially descended from AH2012 and ZMDZY strains in G2b lineages through recombination (Tian et al., 2014) . Other unidentified recombination events and accumulation of adapted mutations were likely involved in this process.",

GDS10 strain was more closely related to CO13 than AH2012, denoting GDS10 and CO13 shared a common ancestor. The determination of source of the emergent strains would help to explain the way by which the viruses could have been accessible to and infected USA pigs.",
