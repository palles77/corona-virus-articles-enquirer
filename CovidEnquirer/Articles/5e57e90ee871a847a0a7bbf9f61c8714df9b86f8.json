            "text": "Cervical lymphadenopathy is a common problem in children. The condition most commonly represents a transient response to a benign local or generalized infection, but occasionally it might herald the presence of a more serious disorder. Acute bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy usually is caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection or streptococcal pharyngitis. Acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis is caused by streptococcal or staphylococcal infection in 40% to 80% of cases. The most common causes of subacute or chronic lymphadenitis are cat scratch disease, mycobacterial infection, and toxoplasmosis. Supraclavicular or posterior cervical lymphadenopathy carries a much higher risk for malignancies than does anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Generalized lymphadenopathy is often caused by a viral infection, and less frequently by malignancies, collagen vascular diseases, and medications. Laboratory tests are not necessary in the majority of children with cervical lymphadenopathy. Most cases of lymphadenopathy are self-limited and require no treatment. The treatment of acute bacterial cervical lymphadenitis without a known primary source should provide adequate coverage for both Staphylococcus aureus and group A beta hemolytic streptococci.",

The most common cause is reactive hyperplasia resulting from an infectious process, most commonly a viral upper respiratory tract infection (Peters & Edwards, 2000) . Upper respiratory tract infection might be caused by rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, or reovirus. Other viruses associated with cervical lymphadenopathy include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus, rubella, rubeola, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), coxsackievirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) . Bacterial cervical lymphadenitis is usually caused by group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus. Anaerobic bacteria can cause cervical lymphadenitis, usually in association with dental caries and periodontal disease. Group B streptococci and Haemophilus influenzae type b are less frequent causal organisms. Diphtheria is a rare cause. Bartonella henselae (cat scratch disease), atypical mycobacteria, and mycobacteria are important causes of subacute or chronic cervical lymphadenopathy (Spyridis, Maltezou, & Hantzakos, 2001) . Chronic posterior cervical lymphadenitis is the most common form of acquired toxoplasmosis and is the sole presenting symptom in 50% of cases (Leung & Robson, 1991) .",

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually significantly elevated in persons with bacterial lymphadenitis. A rapid streptococcal antigen test or a throat culture might be useful to confirm a streptococcal infection. Skin tests for tuberculosis should be performed if these infections are suspected. Additional studies that might be helpful include chest radiography and serologic tests for B henselae, EBV, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasmosis.
