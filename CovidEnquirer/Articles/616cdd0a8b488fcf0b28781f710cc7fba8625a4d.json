            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease involving mostly upper respiratory tract in chickens, leading to significant economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. One of the major concerns regarding to IB is the emergence of new types of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs). The purpose of this study was to identify the IBVs isolated from Iranian broiler chickens with respiratory symptoms. Twenty-five broiler flocks around Ahwaz (southwest of Iran) were examined for IBV. The specimens including trachea, lung, liver, kidney, and ceacal tonsil, were collected from diseased birds and inoculated into chicken embryonated eggs. Harvested allantoic fluids were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers in order to amplify spike 1 (S1) gene of IBV. The RT-PCR products of four IBV isolates were sequenced. The results showed that from 25 examined flocks with respiratory disease, 12 flocks (48.00%) were positive for IBV. In phylogenetic analysis, our isolates were closely related to the QX-like viruses such as PCRLab/06/2012 (Iran), QX, HC9, HC10, CK/CH/GX/NN11-1, CK/CH/JS/YC11-1, CK/CH/JS/2010/13, CK/CH/JS/2011/2 (China), QX/SGK-21, QX/SGK-11 (Iraq) with nucleotide homology up to 99.00%. This study indicates the role of IBVs in the respiratory disorders of broiler flocks located in southwest Iran, and also the existence of a variant of IBV, which is distinguishable from the other Iranian variants.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute contagious viral infection with low mortality and a significant reduction in performance in chicken. The causative agent of IB is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) which is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense and RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae, the genus gamma Coronavirus. The virus consists of three important structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N), the membrane (M), and the spike (S1 and S2) glycoproteins. The nucleotide sequence of the S1 gene is highly variable, which makes it prone to mutation and emergence of new variants of the virus. For this reason, the molecular classification of IBVs is based on the investigation of the S1 gene. 1 Vaccination is one of the best ways of immunization of susceptible birds. However, vaccinated flocks may experience disease involvement because there is almost no cross-protection among serotypes. 2 Consequently, the viral strains that exist in a different geographical area must first be identified and their pathogenicity should be determined in order to select an appropriate virus strain for vaccination.",

Based on our findings, 12 out of 25 examined flocks (48.00%) were found to be infected with IBV, which show the prominent role of the virus in respiratory involvement of Ahvaz broiler flocks. The IBV isolates in the present study were completely different from IBV vaccine strains (H120, Ma5 and 4/91) used for vaccination in Ahvaz, which indicates the incidence of IB infection despite stringent vaccination. The determination of the IBV genotype is necessary not only to understand the evolution of the virus but also for developing vaccines based on circulating IBV strains in the region. 10 One of the significant features of the IB viruses is the emergence of new variants of the virus throughout the world. Therefore, new serotypes and new variants of IBVs are still isolated from chickens, even from vaccinated flocks. 10, 11 The new IBV serotypes should be identified quickly in order to develop an effective vaccination strategy. Several years ago, Massachusetts serotype was identified in poultry flocks of Iran. 4 In recent years, 793B or 4/91 serotype has been identified in Iran by several researchers. 5, 4, 12 Furthermore, the distribution of different IBV genotypes (different from the vaccine strain; Massachusetts) was already reported in Iran. [13] [14] [15] Phylogenetic analysis showed that Isolated IBVs in the present study clustered with QX-like viruses. For the first time, in 1996, QX strain of IBV was identified in China, after which the occurrence of the QX-liked virus was informed and it became one of the most prevalent IBV genotypes in various countries. 16 QX-like IBVs were extended from China, to Europe and recently to the south of Africa. 17 Also, in Iraq, this genotype was also identified. 18 The PCRLab/06/2012 (JX477827) strain of IBV was isolated in Iran and classified as QX-like viruses. 19 The findings of the present study revealed that QX strains of IBV may be originated from other countries (probably Iraq) which has been transmitted to Ahwaz. There is little information about the type of IBV spread between the Middle East countries. However, borderline migrations of birds is probably an important factor. 20 Taken together, this is the first report indicating the circulation of QX-like viruses in Ahvaz broiler chickens with respiratory signs. Finally, a comprehensive study on the pathogenesis of these IBV isolates is suggested.",
