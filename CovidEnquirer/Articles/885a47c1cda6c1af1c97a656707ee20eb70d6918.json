Such analysis of tourism is important because diplomacy and trade continues to be conducted on a nation-to-nation basis despite a growing shift towards multilateralism in free trade blocks such as the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Further, Bilateralism is important because countries have reduced abilities to control tourism imports in an era of growing globalization. A framework that may be employed to analyze problems in bilateral tourism flows is also outlined. Keywords: bilateral framework, destination competitiveness, tourism flows. \u00d3 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

            "text": "In recent decades, tourism has emerged as one of a small group of service industries that increasingly dominate the post-industrial global economy. Because of the volume of funds involved, estimated to be $514 billion (WTO 2003) , tourism imports and exports can significantly influence national balance of payments accounts. In 2000, for example, Japan and Germany recorded net tourism deficits of $28.5 billion and $29.9 billion, respectively, while the United States recorded a net tourism balance of $20.2 billion ( WTO 2002) . As world trade moves towards reducing trading barriers, the ability of countries to unilaterally control tourism exports and imports is becoming increasingly difficult (Wanhill 2000) . There are forced to look for non-regulatory measures to influence flows, such as increasing national attractiveness and competitiveness on a market-by-market or bilateral basis. This paper examines a range of factors that determine the structure of bilateral tourism. The discussion focuses on techniques for identifying underlying demand factors and identifies the role of non-economic factors. Increased understanding of these factors will assist policymakers in developing more effective policies to increase destination competitiveness and attractiveness within a bilateral setting.",

            "text": "Bilateral tourism describes the flow of tourists between two countries, irrespective of proximity, and is measured by actual tourists, their percentage as a proportion of inbound and outbound flows, and the state of the tourism balance of payments. The quantum of the flow between country pairs is a function of a matrix of interrelated factors that includes the public and private sector structures supporting flows, diplomatic relations, and economic and noneconomic factors. Countries that have removed barriers to citizens undertaking foreign tourism have limited capability to regulate outbound flows, but still retain significant capacity to increase inbound flows through measures designed to enhance destination competitiveness and encourage citizens to substitute domestic for international tourism. Policies designed to alter the level of inbound and outbound flows through nonregulatory measures may become important where countries facing a balance of payments crisis decide to adopt policies designed to increase exports and reduce imports of tourism. However, the recent trend towards multilateralism is a factor that compounds the problems encountered when attempts are made to reduce imbalances. As Prideaux and Kim (1999) observed, it is unrealistic to expect bilateral tourism to be in balance between countries because of the complexities of the international nature of demand, differences in national income, exchange rates, existing trading relationships, and differences in population size. Therefore, the study of bilateral tourism is closely allied to research into competitiveness, flows, and attractiveness, but differs in that it looks at factors that influence the volume and composition of flows in both directions between country pairs.",

In assessing bilateral tourism from an economic viewpoint, Mathieson and Wall (1982) discussed the implications of measures designed to regain trade balances, Prideaux and Witt (2000) examined bilateral flows between countries in the ASEAN group and Australia, King and Choi (1999) considered the case of South Korea and Australia, Yu (1998) examined flow patterns between China and Taiwan, and Dwyer (2001) examined a range of issues related to destination competitiveness.",

            "text": "A number of studies have identified specific issues that affect bilateral flows (Godfrey 1999; Langlois, Theodore and Ineson 1999; Murphy and Williams 1999) . Culture is one such issue that has been identified by numerous researchers (Master and Prideaux 2000; Reisinger and Turner 1997, 2002; Sussmann and Rashcovsky 1997) . However, research into international flows has generally overlooked the importance of bilateral tourism and focused on issues such as international competitiveness (Chon and Mayer 1995; Pearce 1997) and destination choice. McKercher (1998) noted the effect of market access on destination choice, stating that more proximate destinations exhibited a competitive advantage over destinations that offered similar products but were less proximate. While these are significant factors determining the size of flows between countries, these concepts have yet to be integrated into a specific study of bilateral tourism. 782 Researchers have also investigated issues of destination competitiveness, including Ritchie and Crouch (2000) , Crouch and Ritchie (1994 , 1999 , Poon (1993) , Kim (2001 , cited in Dwyer 2001 , Dwyer (2001) , Dwyer, Forsyth and Rao (2000a, 2000b) , Buhalis (2000) , and Hassan (2000) . According to Dwyer ''the issue of destination competitiveness is broad and complex: defying attempts to encapsulate it in universally acceptable terms'' (2001:37) , because competitiveness is Leiper (1989) , Pearce (1995) , Oppermann (1999a), Coshall (2000) and Thurot (1980) . Analysis of cross-border tourism by Timothy (1995a Timothy ( , 1995b Timothy ( , 1998 Timothy ( , 2000 found that physical barriers such as fortifications and demarcation markers, the severity of crossing formalities (visas, customs procedures, and quarantine measures), and psychological barriers that include cultural differences, and perceptions of safety and economic factors, all influence bilateral flows. The role of government is a recurrent theme in many studies. Geographers have identified distance, demographics, cost, and lack of information as the main variables influencing the volume of flows. Geographical concepts used to explain international flows include distance decay, gravity models, spatial hierarchy, origin-destination models (Thurot 1980; Lundgren 1982) , and reciprocity (Pearce 1995) . While these models offer a descriptive primarily spatial analysis of tourism, other issues, including political considerations and economic constraints, are largely ignored. As a consequence, existing models have failed to systematically analyze the entire spectrum of factors involved in the authorization, operation, and conduct of international tourism, particularly from a bilateral perspective.",

Mansfeld (1992) suggested a conceptual model of destination choice, while Crompton and Ankomh (1993) examined the proposition of choice sets in destination selection. Other researchers looking at this issue include Woodside and Lysonski (1989) , Um and Crompton (1990) , and Chon (1990) . Furthermore, push and pull factors have been cited as explanations for motivation and destination selection (Dann 1977; Laws 1995; Josiam, Smeaton and Clements 1999; Godfrey 1999; Klenosky 2002) . As each destination in any bilateral pair will have only a limited number of potential pull factors, individual destinations may encounter difficulties in attracting tourists from the other country in the bilateral relationship.",

While these issues are explored in some detail in the literature, less research has been undertaken into the structures that facilitate the operation of bilateral tourism. Its structure and operation can be explained by two groups of 784 elements. The first includes a number of conceptual processes explained by theories such as push-pull, distance decay, and destination competitiveness. The second centers on the structure of bilateral tourism and includes the public and private sectors, linkages, and economic and noneconomic factors.",

Table 1 categorizes the major public and private sector factors as well as the economic and noneconomic factors that constitute the structure of bilateral tourism. The categories are not mutually exclusive, because there may be overlaps between the government and private sectors in the provision of tourism specific goods and services and spill over effects among the different categories of factors. In addition, some jurisdictions may choose to enact legislative frameworks to control or regulate specific areas of tourism activity, while others may choose to leave these areas to the market or simply ignore them altogether. It was also apparent that the factors affecting flows from Country A to Country B might not affect the opposite flow. The range of factors involved is outlined in Table 1 . While not exhaustive, it does illustrate their range and complexity.",

Factors operating at the government level can be subdivided into a number of categories, including diplomatic, policy, marketing, regulatory regimes, and the supply of goods and services. Tourism requires diplomatic recognition to facilitate the issue of visas (if required), recognition of passports, operation of transport modes, and recognition of civil rights. Deterioration in diplomatic relations between country pairs can reduce tourism, while improvements may have the opposite effect. The significance of diplomatic relations was noted by Krohn and O'Donnell (1999) and Butler and Mao (1996) . Mok and Lam (2000) observed that restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam in 1995 was regarded by many Vietnamese as the return of commerce and tourism. War is also a significant factor and during the Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina in 1982, tourism between the two warring nations ceased and took a long time to return to pre-war levels.",

In the bilateral relationships between Australia and all other countries, the imposition of a 10% general sales tax in July 2000 on most goods and services in Australia, but not on overseas airfares, reduced the country's competitiveness. This change may discourage international arrivals because of the increase in price and encourage the substitution of domestic for international tourism to cheaper foreign destinations.

            "text": "Beyond such national shifts, changes that occur to consumers' personal income may alter their purchasing intentions and/or habits. If the cost of travel to a destination increases without a parallel increase in personal income, there may be a change in consumer purchasing habits and preferences. According to standard economic theory (McTaggart, Findlay and Parkin 1999a) , if purchasers of services, in this case tourism, have a choice between obtaining domestic services or foreign services, they will compare prices. Other things remaining constant, the higher the foreign price or the lower the domestic price the greater is the propensity for the purchaser to purchase domestic goods. This will also occur in a situation where the purchaser is experiencing a depreciation of their currency relative to the currency of the bilateral partner. Tourism expenditure is also relatively price sensitive (Bull 1995) and can be measured by expenditure elasticity of demand described as the amount of change in purchasing power of a specific good such as tourism in proportion to the increase in prices charged for that good. BRUCE PRIDEAUX 791 Elasticity of demand is another economic factor that may be significant in some bilateral relationships. The higher the rate of change in demand caused by a shift in price the more elastic the product is. The degree of elasticity depends on a number of factors, including the ease one product or service can be substituted for another, the proportion of the consumer's income spent on the product or service, and the elapse of time from the change in price. The substitution effect refers to the tendency of consumers to substitute one product for another, in this case destinations, due to a number of factors that may include changes in the elasticity of demand, shifts in price, and a desire to try new products or experiences (Tribe 1995) . Economic theory states that the closer the substitutes are for a service or product, the more elastic is the demand for those services or products (McTaggart, Findlay and Parkin 1999b) . During the Asian Financial Crisis, the value of the Korean won fell in relation to other countries not affected by the crisis. As a consequence, travel to Australia, and other countries not affected by the Asian Financial Crisis, became relatively more expensive for Korean consumers, who turned to domestic destinations as a substitute causing outbound flows to fall by 32.5% in 1998. Conversely, as the value of the Korean won fell, overseas consumers were encouraged to substitute Korea for other destinations, resulting in a shift from negative growth in 1996 (\u00c01.8%) to positive growth of 6.1% in 1997 and 8.8% in 1998 . The elasticity of demand and propensity to substitute among destinations are important factors that need to be included in any assessment of bilateral tourism markets.",

In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attack on the United States, international tourism declined between many nations even where they had not been linked to any terrorist threat. Following the October 2002 terrorist attack in Bali, tourism between Australia and Indonesia fell because of the fear of further attacks. Measures to reassure tourists of destination safety will become increasingly important as the perceived level of safety becomes a factor in destination selection. After the Bali bombings, Australians switched to safe destinations such as Fiji, New Zealand, and North Asia. Surprisingly, Fiji, only several years before had been subject to adverse Australian government travel advisory notices following an attempted coup and had suffered a 60% decline in Australian inbound tourism. But when the advisory notice was lifted, the industry quickly recovered. In a similar observation, 792 BILATERAL TOURISM Cothran and Cothran (1998) noted that the remarkable potential of the Mexican tourism industry was at risk because of growing political instability.",

In 1999, 0.77% of Australia's total population visited Singapore while the flow in the other direction was 5.8%. This analysis can be further developed by segmenting arrivals by purpose (including pleasure, business, and education), or by measuring changes longitudinally. Taking the example of Singapore, it is apparent that Australia has been far more successful in attracting Singaporeans than the other way around as a percentage of population. Further, this analysis may signal that Australia could experience future decline in what appears to be a relatively mature market if Singaporeans look to new and unfamiliar destinations. For Australia, this type of analysis should signal the need to closely examine how sustainable Singaporean repeat business will be in the future, as well as indicating the need to develop new Australian products and destinations that will encourage a continued high level of Singaporean repeat tourism.",

Other ways to measure changes include Neo-Fordist, Post-Fordist (Torres 2001) , and Postmodernist interpretations (Urry 1990; of possible shifts from standardized production and consumption of mass tourism experiences to mass niche, specialized or individualized tour consumption. When models and interpretations of this type are applied in conjunction with the outbound visitor flow ratios there is scope to develop diagnostic tools for application to tourism policy. The previous illustration of the inability of Korea to boost Australian arrivals, because of a misunderstanding of the Australian market, is another tool. This, combined with a modified tourism area lifecycle model, the resort development spectrum model, or perhaps a Post-Fordist/Postmodernist interpretation of demand, may be used to develop destination marketing strategies and policies. It may also be useful to employ the bilateral framework shown in Table 1 to evaluate elements of tourism as illustrated in Table  2 . In this example, positive and negative effects of specific factors of government responsibilities are highlighted and possible corrective actions to reduce negative factors are outlined in the Australia to Indonesia component of their bilateral tourism. While Table 2 only considers government responsibilities, any comprehensive analysis must also include all other elements of the bilateral framework as discussed. Table 2 is an example of a simple diagnostic test or checklist that may be employed to examine tourism flows. Prideaux, Laws and Faulkner (2003) identified ten major shocks to Indonesia's tourism industry during the period 1996 to 2002 that impacted on the inbound tourism from Australia. Many of these emanated from difficult internal political and economic conditions in Indonesia, which led to severe fluctuations in the level of Australian arrivals. The August 2003, terrorist bombing of the JR Marriott Hotel in central Jakarta further illustrates the need for greater security of tourists identified in Table 2 . 794 The previous discussion illustrates the relationship among the various factors comprising the structure of the framework outlined in Figure 1 . Its use for a more detailed analysis will further highlight linkages between specific factors that uniquely influence the pattern of flows between specific country pairs. For example, Australians have little difficulty obtaining visas for Thailand, but Thais face a much more rigorous process because of concern about tourists who overstay or who enter the country to work illegally. In these circumstances, reducing visa restrictions may encourage additional arrivals, although there may be an associated cost of apprehending and deporting Thais who overstay. The possible net benefit to Australia may be measured by comparing the increase in receipts from additional Thai arrivals Note: This example only examines the government responsibilities of the bilateral framework outlined in Table 1 , whose factors require a comprehensive consideration of all factors outlined in Figure 2 .",
