Four different bacteriophages were used as surrogates for the mammalian viruses. Results showed that the collection efficiency was significantly affected by the morphology of the virus particles. For hydrophilic viruses, the collection efficiencies of the Andersen impactor, impinger, and gelatin filter were 10 times higher than that of the nuclepore filter. For hydrophilic viruses, the collection efficiencies of all four samplers were 10-100 times higher than hydrophobic viruses. The infectivity of the virus in collected samples was also evaluated for an AGI-30 impinger. Results showed that the viruses retained more infectivity when the samples were refrigerated (up to 1 day) during storage than when stored at room temperature (up to 8 h). Therefore, even when refrigerated, airborne virus samples collected using an impinger should be processed as soon as possible to avoid loss of virus infectivity. \u1b67",

Airborne and droplet transmission are the major routes for spreading viral diseases, such as smallpox, influenza, measles, and mumps. Recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and influenza virus have attracted public attention and are believed to be transmitted by aerosol. Virus droplets generated from sneezing or coughing typically range from 1 to 100 m in size and will evaporate to droplet nuclei that approach the size of the individual microbe (Kowalski & Bahnfleth, 1998) . Such droplet nuclei remain airborne for long periods of time (up to 1 day) with potential for retention in the respiratory tract (Ijaz, Karim, Sattar, & Johnson-Lussenburg, 1987) . When a virus is encased in a droplet, its infectivity is enhanced due to shielding from drying, temperature, and sunlight, compared to an isolated airborne virus (Tyrrell, 1967) . Due to such droplet encasement, virus-containing aerosols less than 2 m in size have higher infectivity than those of the virus itself (Couch et al., 1965) .",

Such delay gives the organisms an opportunity to multiply or die in transit (Thorne, Kiekhaefer, Whitten, & Donham, 1992) . Although the effect of storage time and temperature on survival of bacterial and fungal aerosols collected using impingers has been reported (Li & Lin, 2001; Lin & Li, 2003) , the effect on survival of virus aerosols has not yet been reported until our current study. Although a virus is an obligate parasite and cannot multiply without a host in the collection medium, virus infectivity might still be affected by the sampling method, storage temperature, storage duration, and sample processing. The results for collection efficiency from the previous sampling studies of aerosolized virus discussed above (Hatch & Warren, 1969; Dubovi & Akers, 1970; could not be compared due to the use of different sampling devices, evaluation indexes, and virus targets. The collection efficiencies of different sampling devices for collecting infective viruses with different morphology and nucleic acid types needs further investigation.",

A high titer stock of bacteriophages (10 9 -10 10 PFU/mL) Plaque forming units (PFU) was prepared via plate lysis and elution. To allow the phage to attach to the host, the bacteriophages were mixed with their own respective host. First, 5 ml of top agar was added to a sterile tube of infected cells. Then, the contents of the tube were mixed by gentle tapping for 5 s and poured onto the center of a labeled agar plate. Finally, the plate was incubated for 24 h either at 37 \u2022 C for coliphages or at 26 \u2022 C for phi 6. After cultivation, 5 ml SM buffer (containing NaCl, MgSO 4 \u00b7 7H 2 O, Tris, and gelatin) was pipetted onto a plate that showed confluent lysis. Then, the plate was slowly rocked for 40 min and the buffer was transferred to a tube for centrifugation at 4000 \u00d7 g for 10 min. After the supernatant was removed, the resulting phage stock was stored at 4 \u2022 C . Plaque assay described by Adams (1959) was then used to measure the bacteriophage concentrations.",

To better understand the collection efficiency for virus aerosols, the viability of microorganisms in liquid suspension used as the source of the generated bioaerosols should be evaluated.

Each particle size distribution represents the mean of at least three trials. three viruses. These differences might be because MS2 and phi X174 phages are lipid-free icosahedral viruses, and are therefore more resistant to sampling stress compared to T7, which has a tail fiber, and to phi 6, which has a lipid envelope. The observed higher RR for the tailed phage T7 at high RH (85% RH) might be due to the formation of a moisture film that protects the delicate tail fibers of this phage from sampling stress (Hatch & Warren, 1969) . Because the lipid content of phi 6 is extremely sensitive to environmental stress (Woolwine & Gerberding, 1995) , the low RR of phi 6 might be related to the lipid content being affected by the sampling stress, such as impaction and dehydration. The lipid content of phi 6 reportedly is essential for infectivity (Woolwine & Gerberding, 1995) . ",

These findings agree well with those reported for tailed phages T1 and T3 collected using an impinger (Harstad, 1965; Hatch & Warren, 1969) .

The RR for T7 at RH 85% was 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , higher than those at RH 20% and 55%. Because all four of the test virus aerosols in this study were larger than the 0.4-m pore size of this nuclepore filter, penetration of the virus aerosols through the filter should be negligible. The observed loss of virus infectivity (reflected by the extremely low RR) in samples collected using a nuclepore filter is probably primarily related to the biological stress during filtration, dehydration during sampling, and extraction process (Li et al., 1999) .",

The Andersen impactor, impinger, and gelatin filter were found superior to the nuclepore filter for sampling hydrophilic viruses. In addition, the RR values of hydrophobic viruses (i.e., phi 6) (viruses with a lipid envelope) was lower than that of hydrophilic viruses (i.e., MS2, phi X174 and T7), because lipid is extremely sensitive to sampling stress, and virus recoveries of MS2, phi X174, and phi 6 did not depend on RH, whereas that of T7, which has a tail fiber, strongly depended on RH. These results are similar to those previously reported for bacteria, endospores, and fungal spores . Specifically, when the impactor or impinger were used for virus collection, the RR values for MS2 and phi X174 viruses were similar to those for E. coli and yeast cells, but lower than those for endospore B. subtilis and Penicillium Li et al., 1999; . When the gelatin filter was used, the RR values for MS2 and phi X174 virus were lower than that for Penicillium, were similar to those for B. subtilis and yeast, and were higher than that for E. coli (Lin & Li, 1998; . When the nuclepore filter was used, the recoveries for MS2 and phi X174 virus were lower than those reported for Penicillium and B. subtilis and were similar to those for yeast and E. coli (Li et al., 1999; .",

When stored at room temperature, Phi 6 retained little infectivity (< 10%) in all three media (Fig. 9 ), but when refrigerated, it retained more than 80% infectivity in either deionized water or peptone broth. Based on previous studies indicating that salt solution might lower the infectivity of phage because of sampling stress of unbalanced forces at the air-water interface (Dubovi & Akers, 1970; Trouwborst & de Jong, 1973) , the infectivity of phage phi 6 could be significantly affected by the salt in the nutrient broth during the impingement and thus cause the loss of virus infectivity. No plaque was found in the MS2, phi X174, and phi 6 samples in nutrient broth stored for 24 h at room temperature, possibly due to interference of plaque assay. Further study is needed, however, to confirm this interference.",
