The aim of this study was to evaluate the histopathological status of the peripheral lymphoid tissues and thymus of Iberian lynxes necropsied between 1998 and 2003. Seventeen animals including females (nZ8) and males (nZ9), age range of 10 months to 16 years, with different causes of death were histopathologically and immunohistochemically (anti-CD3, CD79, MAC387, CD68) studied. Feline immunosuppressive virus laboratorial tests were negative. Five individuals presented neoplasia and/or tuberculosis. All animals presented some degree of both B and T cells depletion in peripheral lymphoid tissues and follicular hyalinosis in the center of depleted follicles. A viral origin of the lymphoid depletion is postulated although other causes (inbreeding, stress, toxic) are not ruled out. The loss of the effectiveness of the immune system increases the vulnerability of the critically endangered Iberian lynx to pathogens. q R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Le lynx d'Espagne (Lynx pardinus) est l'esp\u00e8ce de f\u00e9lin sauvage la plus menac\u00e9e au monde.

            "text": "The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is the most threatened wild feline in the world [1] . It is considered 'critically endangered' [2] and it is located only in two small isolated metapopulations in Southern Spain, the Do\u00f1ana area and Sierra Morena [3] . The progressive disappearance of these animals in the past decades has been attributed to decreases in the populations of their main prey, the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), due to myxomatosis, traps and hunting [4] [5] [6] . Nowadays, the Iberian lynx is threatened by the fragmentation and loss of its habitat [7] , estimating a total population under 200 individuals [3] . The conservation of this European large wild cat is of great concern to the European Union authorities who are given large amounts of funds for its conservation. The causes of 'non-natural' mortality (prompted by human intervention) of the Iberian lynx have been thoroughly studied during the past decades [8] , but there are no references of mortality by diseases or necropsy findings. Little is known about diseases and pathology that affect the Iberian lynx; there are only a few publications about tuberculosis [9] [10] [11] and parasites [12] [13] [14] in the Iberian lynx, and there are no previous reports concerning histopathological findings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the histopathological status of the peripheral lymphoid tissues and thymus of Iberian lynxes necropsied between 1998 and 2003 in relation to other pathologies found in the animals.",

The spleen was the lymphoid organ in which the cellular depletion (number of follicles and cellular density) was more evident and frequent (Table 3) . It was not possible to carry out the histological evaluation due to autolysis in two cases. One case did not show immune depletion with H&E and the rest of the animals studied presented some degree of lymphoid depletion (7 mild, 5 moderate and 2 severe). The grade of LD per animal did not depend on the origin of the animal, whether it was free or captive, or the cause of death, and it increased with age: mild LD was found mainly in young or young-adult animals while moderate and severe LD was more frequent in aged animals. LD was also severe in two Iberian lynxes suffering tuberculosis (Cases 16 and 17). Hyaline substance deposition was commonly observed in lymphoid follicles with evident lymphoid depletion (Fig. 1) . Besides traumatic lesions, the most interesting histopathological findings were pneumonia, epithelial neoplasms and tuberculosis (Table 1) . Five individuals (Cases 6, 11, 12, 16 and 17) presented neoplasia (squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and urinary bladder 'in situ' carcinoma) and/or tuberculosis (M. bovis, PCR). In one of the cases with tuberculosis (Case 11), the granulomas were only found in the lung (tuberculous primary complex); in another case with disseminated tuberculosis (Case 16) the main tuberculosis lesions were found in liver and lymph nodes, although small granulomas were also observed in the lung; another animal with a history of blindness (since 3 months of age) with generalized tuberculosis (Case 17), granulomas of tuberculosis were found in lung, liver, lymph nodes, both adrenal glands, and in both ocular globes (bilateral tuberculos granulomatous uveitis). In all granulomas acid-fast bacilli were histologically identified by the Ziehl-Neelsen technique and immunohistochemistry. Multinucleated cells (2-5 nuclei) were observed in the granulomas. No evidence of feline immunosuppressive virus infection (feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukaemia virus, feline coronavirus and feline panleukopenia virus) was found in any of the individuals.",

Spleen was the lymphoid organ with more evident hypocellularity and decreases of CD3 and CD79 populations (T and B lymphocytes). B cells were decreased in many cases in the spleen and lymph nodes but normal or increased in MALT. Minor reduction in T and B subpopulations, together with increases of macrophages (MAC387 and CD68 positive-cells) in lymph nodes and MALT samples could have been influenced by local pathologies (i.e. intestinal parasitic infestations in mesenteric lymph nodes and intestinal MALT). The increased number of macrophages and dendritic cells (MAC387 and CD68 positive cells) found in the splenic red pulp and lymph node medulla of tissues with T and B cell reductions indicates a proliferation of these cell types that remains unexplained although it could represent a compensating situation. T and B cell depletion and increase macrophage proliferation has been indicated in lymphoid tissues of domestic cats with experimental feline infectious peritonitis (Feline coronavirus) [15] .

In our opinion, the presentation of these neoplastic and infectious diseases were promoted by the defects in the immune system although the alternative hypothesis is equally valid. The coexistence in the same animal of pulmonary tuberculosis and squamous cells carcinoma of the skin and, in another case, the coexistence of two different epithelial carcinomas (skin and urinary transitional epithelium), could be coincidental, but also could be the result of a immunodeficiency status. To our knowledge this is the first report of any kind of tumor in the Iberian lynx. There are several publications describing tuberculosis in the Iberian lynx [9] [10] [11] . In two of our three cases, the primary pulmonary lesions indicate that the contamination was probably by inhalation from contaminated food as it has been indicated in a previous case of tuberculosis in the Iberian lynx and in other wild felids [10, 20] . In the remaining case, the distribution and size of the lesions do not confirm an inhalation route of contamination and suggest a digestive origin of the tuberculosis. Multinucleated cells (2-5 nuclei) observed in the granulomas did not display the typical aspect of Langhans' cells as in other species infected with M. bovis [19] .

In the previous report about the pathology of one Iberian lynx with tuberculosis [10] , both adrenal glands were also affected. This fact could indicate a special predisposition of these animals to have adrenal tuberculosis, since adrenal glands are not a common site for tuberculosis lesions in other animal species [19] . Ocular tuberculosis is an uncommon but documented finding in the domestic cat [21] that has never been referred to in wild felids and could be also a consequence of an immune deficiency status. In our case, the early appearance of blindness (3-month-old) seems to indicate an ocular primoinfection rather than a dissemination, possibly due to contact with contaminated food. Nevertheless, the high prevalence of tuberculosis in our series of cases can be also influenced by the high prevalence of the disease in wild and domestic ungulates living in the same areas [11] .",

All the animals were negative to feline immunosuppressive viruses (FeLV, FIV, FCoV, FPV) using conventional techniques for the domestic cat, which do not exclude the possibility of infection with lynx-specific viral strains or unknown viruses. In fact, the histopathological findings of the present study are coincident with those found in cats infected with immunosupppressive viruses, specially in non-acute diseases or carrier stages [19, 22] . Stress should also be taken into account as a possible origin of the immune depletion but only in the captive animals (nZ4). Finally, there are several reasons to consider a primary immune system defect due to the inbreeding of the Iberian lynx. Evidences for reduced genetic variability in the Iberian lynx, due to the low number of individuals separated in two small subpopulations, have been recently published [7] .",

Prospective investigations are necessary to assess the clinical immune system parameters (serum concentrations of IgA, IgG, IgM; in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis with mitogens; flow cytometric quantification of blood subpopulations of leukocytes) in appropriate samples of living Iberian lynxes to know (a) if the histological cellular depletion found in this series of cases is present in the left population of Iberian lynxes; (b) if there are important clinical consequences and (c) the possible existence of a viral infection non-detected by conventional laboratorial techniques. The free status of the animals and therefore delicate management of this species makes it difficult to carry out such studies; in any case, sampling of living animals requires capture and anesthesia. Our preliminary results of an ongoing prospective study indicate the presence of leukopenia and lymphopenia in some of the animals.",
