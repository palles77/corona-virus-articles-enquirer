The nucleus is comparted from the cytoplasm by nuclear envelope, in which there are numerous pores that allow small molecules, such as ions, metabolites, and globular protein smaller than 40 kDa, freely passing through (McLane and Corbett, 2009; Wu et al., 2011) . Protein over 40 kDa cannot pass through the nuclear pores unless it owns nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence. NLS usually is rich in basic amino acids and resides near the C-terminal of the protein (McLane and Corbett, 2009) . Through binding to nuclear import receptors including importin a and b, the NLS guides the protein transportation into the nucleus (Goldfarb et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "The biosynthesis of RNA viruses occurs in the cytoplasm. The capsid proteins of RNA viruses are also distributed in the cytoplasm to assemble the progeny virions (Wychowski et al., 1985) . However, recent studies reveal that the capsid proteins of some RNA viruses, such as Dengue virus (Colpitts et al., 2011) , West Nile virus (WNV) (Bhuvanakantham et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2008) , and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Pei et al., 2008) , can translocate to the nucleus and, thereafter, disturb the nuclear functions. In the cells infected with Dengue virus, a large portion of the Dengue virus capsid protein localizes in the nucleus and acts as a histone mimic to disrupt nucleosome formation (Colpitts et al., 2011) . The capsid protein C of WNV localizes in the nucleus through importin-mediated pathway and can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC). The phosphorylation of the WNV capsid protein C influences its nuclear trafficking by modulating the efficiency of protein C-importin-a binding (Bhuvanakantham et al., 2010) and subsequently induces p53-dependent apoptosis (Yang et al., 2008) . The nucleocapsid protein N is the most abundant structural protein of PRRSV. During PRRSV infection, the N protein is specifically localized in the nucleus and nucleolus in addition to its normal cytoplasmic distribution (Pei et al., 2008) . In vivo infection with the NLS-null PRRSV mutant causes reduced viremia and increased production of neutralizing antibodies in the infected pigs. Therefore, it is evident that the nuclear localization of protein N plays a critical role in the PRRSV pathogenesis and host responses to PRRSV (Pei et al., 2008) .",

Group B coxsackieviruses (CVB), which include six types (CVB1-CVB6), are the major pathogens of human myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy (Fairweather et al., 2012; Yajima and Knowlton, 2009) . CVB genome is a single-stranded RNA of 7.4 kb with positive polarity (Lindberg et al., 1987) . With only one open reading frame, CVB genome encodes a large polyprotein, which is cleaved into the mature viral proteins by viral proteinases 2A and 3C (Lindberg et al., 1987; Sean and Semler, 2008) . CVB capsid is composed of four structural proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4. The VP1 protein, which locates on the surface of the capsid, is the main neutralizing antigen of the virus (Muckelbauer and Rossmann, 1997) . Previous studies showed that the VP1 protein not only is a structural unit of the capsid, but also involves in the viral pathogenesis. A single amino acid mutation in the VP1 protein can significantly change the plaque phenotype of CVB3 (Zhang et al., 1995) . Mutations in the 5 0 untranslated region and VP1coding sequence can attenuate the cardiovirulence of CVB (Cameron-Wilson et al., 1998; Tam et al., 2003) . Single amino acid change (Q164K) within the exposed region of the VP1 protein can change the cytolytic and apoptotic abilities of CVB2 (Gullberg et al., 2010) . These findings indicate that the VP1 protein plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of CVB.",

The alignment showed that two basic amino acids in CVB3 VP1 protein, the 220th histidine (H) and the 230th lysine (K), were substituted by acidic threonine (T) and proline (P), respectively, in EV71 VP1. The amino acid difference in these particular sites might determine the distinct localizations of the VP1 proteins of CVB3 and EV71. Therefore, we performed sitedirected mutagenesis to generate two CVB3 VP1 mutants, the VP1 H220T and VP1 K230P , by substituting the His220 and Lys230 with threonine and proline, respectively, in both EGFP-tagged and untagged CVB3 VP1 proteins (Fig. 4B) . In HeLa cells, the VP1 K230P protein with K230P mutation still localized in the nucleus, while both the untagged and EGFP-tagged VP1 H220T proteins with H220T mutations did not localized in the nucleus. Instead, dotted distribution of VP1 H220T was found in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 4C and D) . These data indicate that the His220 was a key amino acid residue in the NLS of CVB3 VP1 protein.",

In the HeLa cells expressing these truncates, the truncate VP1D703-843, VP1D547-843, VP1D445-843, and VP1D322-843 were distributed in dotted pattern, while the truncate VP1D214-843 and VP1D118-843 were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B) .

We did not observed a significant alteration in the expression of NF-kB p65 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) (data not shown). However, the cell cycle in the EGFP-VP1-expressing cells without synchronization treatment was altered significantly from that of the EGFP-VP1 H220T -expressing cells at the time point of 48 h post-transfection. Compared to the cell cycle in the normal control group (25.571.3% for S phase and 8.072.4% for G2-M phase) at 48 h post-transfection, the EGFP-VP1-expressing cells showed prolonged S phase (44.270.5%) and shortened G2-M phases (2.573.6%), while the EGFP-VP1 H220Texpressing cells showed prolonged S phase in less extent (34.174.2%) and relatively normal G2-M phases (6.572.2%) (Fig. 6) . There was no significant change among the cell cycles of three groups at 24 h post-transfection, possibly due to the plasmids needed time for gene expression. A similar prolonged S phase was also observed in the synchronized EGFP-VP1-expressing cells at 48 h post-transfection (Fig. S4, Supplementary data) . These data suggest that the event of CVB3 VP1 nuclear localization alone could sufficiently deregulate the cell cycle.",

However, the EGFP-VP1 protein is about 60 kDa, that is beyond the 40 kDa limit of passive diffusion through the nuclear pores for a globular protein. On the other hand, previous study showed that the conformation of CVB3 VP1 was not globular when it assembled the capsid with VP2, VP3, and VP4 (Muckelbauer et al., 1995a; Muckelbauer et al., 1995b) . Therefore, we speculated that CVB3 VP1 protein might own a NLS sequence that helped the EGFP-VP1 protein passing through the nuclear pore. To locate the NLS sequence in the CVB3 VP1 protein, truncation strategy was employed in this study. By expressing two VP1 truncates at about 100-amino acid intervals, the NLS sequence was roughly located near the C-terminal of VP1 protein.",

NLS is usually a basic amino acid-rich sequence (McLane and Corbett, 2009; Tran and Wente, 2006) . The alignment for the Met213-Ile275 sequences showed that two basic amino acids (His220 and Lys230) in CVB3 VP1 were substituted by acidic amino acid threonine and proline, respectively, in EV71 VP1 (Fig. 4A) . By expressing the mutants VP1 H220T and VP1 K230P in HeLa cells, we found that the VP1 H220T mutant completely abolished the nuclear translocation (Fig. 4) .

A part of the cytoplasmic VP1 should be that assembled in the progeny virus capsid. It might also be a result of the relocation of nuclear localized VP1 somehow caused by CVB3 infection. Previous studies demonstrated that enteroviral protease 2A could cause the cytoplasmic redistribution of nuclear proteins through cleaving the nuclear pore complex (NPC) components (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001; Gustin, 2003) . Indeed, considerable amount of cytoplasmic EGFP-VP1 could also be observed in the pEGFP-VP1-transfected cells with CVB3 infection simultaneously (Fig.  S3, Supplementary data) .",

The host chromatin and histone proteins are always the targets of the viral capsid proteins (Bhuvanakantham et al., 2010; Colpitts et al., 2011; Surjit et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2008; Zhirnov and Klenk, 1997) . Dengue virus capsid protein can act as a histone mimic to disrupt the nucleosome formation (Colpitts et al., 2011) . WNV capsid protein C can bind to human double minute 2 (HDM2) and induce p53-dependent apoptosis (Bhuvanakantham et al., 2010) . Influenza virus matrix protein M1 can interact with the core histones (Zhirnov and Klenk, 1997) . The nucleocapsid protein N of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus arrest the cells in S phase by directly inhibiting the cyclin-CDK complex (Surjit et al., 2006) . To evaluate whether the CVB3 VP1 nuclear localization affects cellular phenotype, the cell cycle of the HeLa cells expressing CVB3 VP1 and VP1 H220T proteins was preliminarily analyzed. Our results demonstrate that the VP1 nuclear localization caused a prolonged S phase and shortened G2-M phase in the asynchronous cells (Fig. 6) and a prolonged S phase only in the synchronized cells (Fig. S4, Supplementary data) . These data imply that the VP1 nuclear localization may somehow interfere with cellular genome replication or disrupt cell cycle regulators, e.g., cyclin A, CDK2, and retinoblastoma protein (Eguchi et al., 2007) . The precise mechanism needs further study.",

The protein synthesis and viral production of CVB3 are dramatically higher in HeLa cells arrested at the G1 or G1/S stage, while the virus-infected cells at the G0 or G2-M stage express less protein and make less infectious CVB3. In addition, CVB3 infection can also disrupt host cell homeostasis by inducing cell cycle arrest through increasing ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of cyclin D1 (Luo et al., 2003) .
