            "text": "It is important to understand how historical factors have impacted on the establishment of TCM theory. During the period between 770BCE and 200BCE when Huangdi Nei Jing was written, science and technology around the world was still in its na\u00efve form, therefore the study of medicine would not be carried out by sophisticated experiments, and rather it was via direct observation and clinical practice. The basic TCM theory was generated by the involvement of ancient Chinese philosophies such as the Taoist school, Confucianism, Huang-Lao doctrines (to name a few but not limited to this) to induct and deduct the section of the knowledge and experiences that came from the observation and clinical practices. [8] These TCM theories have been used as guidelines for clinical practices and at the same time were tested so that, eventually, by dumping incorrect and incoherent knowledge or theory, they were converted into a better form of TCM theory. There are obviously marked connections that can be identified between ancient Chinese philosophies and TCM theory, for example: from the harmony between man and nature of the Taoist school and Confucianism to the holistic approach concept of TCM; [8] from \"tao\" (universal principal) and \"qi\"(vital material) of Huang-Lao doctrines to the viscera doctrine of TCM; [8] from Yin Yang Xiao Xi (yearly variation of yin and yang) and Wu De Zhuan Yi (transfer of five virtues) of naturalists to the theory of yin-yang and fi ve elements of TCM; [8] and from Zhong Yong Zhi Dao (the doctrine of the mean Confucian-the harmony between human beings) of Confucianism to the harmony among Zang Fu (the viscera), Qi-Blood and Yin-Yang of TCM. [8] Building upon the TCM theory and knowledge in and before the Han dynasty, Shanghan Zabing Lun (Treatise on Exogenous Febrile Diseases and Miscellaneous Diseases) was written around 210AD by Zhang Zhongjing. [9] Later, the book was divided into two books: one as Shanghan Lun (Treatise on Exogenous Febrile Diseases), another as Jin Kui Yao Lue (Synopsis of the Golden Chamber).",

However, it is limited when diseases have either a pathogenous mechanism that is unknown or the agent to break down the circle of pathogen (an example can be viral infectious diseases) is unfound.
