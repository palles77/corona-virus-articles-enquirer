However, NASA has collected dust in the stratosphere since 1981, including large amounts of terrestrial dust (windblown dust, volcanic ash, and aerosols). 5 Since wind-blown terrestrial dust can reach the stratosphere, terrestrial single cells are likely to as well, providing a simpler and more credible explanation of the results referred to by Wickramasinghe ",

However, unlike Earth, this extraterrestrial source of life must allow vast amounts of biological material to Sir-Chandra Wickramasinghe and colleagues 1 suggest that the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic might have an extraterrestrial origin. Their unstated assumption is that the emergence of life and the sudden appearance of several global epidemics are the outcomes of a continuous bombardment of Earth with bacteria and viruses, originating in the interstellar grains and comets. 2 This theory is unlikely. Delivery of exogenous material to the Earth's surface is a well documented phenomenon. It includes extraterrestrial organic compounds present in carbonaceous chondritic meteorites and interplanetary dust particles, which seem to be related to cometary nuclei. However, there is no basis for the claim made by Wickramasinghe and colleagues that there is a daily influx of about 1 tonne of extraterrestrial microbes, which they assume corresponds to one hundredth of the daily infall of cometary material. The present dust infall is 4\u03eb10 7 kg per year and, although its organic composition is poorly understood, there is no evidence that it includes extraterrestrial prokaryotes or other forms of microbial life. 3 The few individual molecules that have been characterised in interplanetary dust particles are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 4 none of which are bona-fide biosignatures. Although this material could have played a part in the origin of life, its connection with extant evolutionary processes is tenuous at best, and probably has no relevance in the appearance of infectious diseases.",

The presence of these microbes at 41 km from the Earth's surface is consistent with the presence of different bacterial species and fungal spores collected from clouds, 4 but cannot be evidence of an extraterrestrial origin.
