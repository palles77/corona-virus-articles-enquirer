The transmission of an exogenous retrovirus, SFV, from macaques (Macaca fascicularis) to a human at a monkey temple in Bali, Indonesia, was investigated with molecular and serologic techniques. Antibodies to SFV were detected by Western blotting of serum from 1 of 82 humans tested. SFV DNA was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the blood of the same person. Cloning and sequencing of PCR products confirmed the virus's close phylogenetic relationship to SFV isolated from macaques at the same temple. This study raises concerns that persons who work at or live around monkey temples are at risk for infection with SFV.",

            "text": "R ecent epidemics such as HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have changed the way we view emerging infectious diseases; these epidemics show that animal reservoirs are important sources of new infectious threats to humans. Contact between humans and animals is a crucial rate-limiting step in this process, although data describing the variables that influence animal-tohuman transmission are relatively scarce. Nonhuman primates, by virtue of their genetic, physiologic, and sometimes social similarities to humans, are particularly likely sources of infectious agents that pose a threat to humans (1, 2) . Data on simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV dramatize this point; scientists now theorize that SIVs were transmitted from primates to humans on several occasions (3, 4) . As a result, concern is increasing that other infectious agents enzootic in primate populations may endanger humans (5) .",

The resulting human form of the virus, HTLV, is the etiologic agent of 2 human diseases, adult T-cell leukemia and tropical spastic paresis (9) . Serologic studies have demonstrated evidence of primateto-human transmission of simian retrovirus (SRV), a retrovirus enzootic among Old World monkeys, in laboratory workers exposed to captive primates (10) . To date, no disease has been linked to human infection with SRV. Finally, in the past decade, evidence of infection with simian foamy virus (SFV) has been identified in 1% to 4% of persons who come into frequent contact with primates in zoos and primate laboratories and among 1% of bushmeat hunters in Central Africa (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) .",

Phylogenetic analyses of SFVs indicate a species-specific distribution of virus strains not unlike that of SIV among some African primate species (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . Among captive primate populations, seroprevalence of antibodies to SFV may reach 100% in adults, with many animals seroconverting before the onset of sexual maturity (19, 24 ; J. Allan, unpub. data). Fewer data are available on the seroprevalence of antibodies to SFV among free-ranging populations of primates. SFV is present in highest concentrations in the saliva of infected laboratory macaques (Macaca mulatta and M. fascicularis) and African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), which suggests that bites, scratches, and mucosal splashes with saliva from primates are likely mechanisms of transmission (25) (26) (27) .",

Given our lack of knowledge of the effects of SFV, as well as the poorly defined risk of other primateborne zoonoses, steps should be taken to decrease the risks of cross-species transmission among the many persons who visit these sites. Previous data on both worker and visitor exposure to macaques at monkey temples suggest that human behaviors, especially the practice of feeding macaques, is a risk factor for being bitten or scratched (33, 34) . We have recommended that monkeys be fed only by specially trained personnel who minimize physical contact with monkeys. Such restrictions have been successfully employed at other monkey forests in Asia. For example, Singapore's Bukit Timah Nature Reserve has nearly 200 free-ranging macaques (M. fascicularis), and in 2002, an estimated 380,000 visitors made use of the reserve's trail system, yet contact between monkeys and visitors at Bukit Timah is rare.

Our findings suggest that workers in and around monkey temples can become infected with SFV. By implication, visitors to monkey temples, especially those who are bitten by a macaque, may also be at risk for SFV infection. Because many visitors to monkey temples are international travelers, these findings have ramifications for the potential global spread of primateborne infectious agents. Demonstrating natural cross-species transmission in a context that does not involve hunting for bushmeat implies that other contexts of primate-human contact may also facilitate the transmission of simian pathogens. These data point to the need for further research into SFV transmission in other contexts, including pet ownership and performance animals, as well as in the diverse geographic areas where humans and primates come into contact.

Bootstrap values >60% are shown. The mtDNA tree was plotted in Treeview. This analysis suggests that BH66 was of human origin. Although the phylogenetic tree constructed with mtDNA from a variety of monkey samples can be used to distinguish human from monkey mtDNA, a large number of nuclear mtDNA sequences, have evolved as pseudogenes (36) . These sequences can be highly divergent from mtDNA and resulted in some ambiguity as mtDNA amplified from several monkeys did not group with other members of the same species. Because of the nature and variability of these sequences, definitive conclusions about mtDNA phylogenies could not be determined; however, mtDNA trees were still useful for determining the origin of mtDNA material.",
