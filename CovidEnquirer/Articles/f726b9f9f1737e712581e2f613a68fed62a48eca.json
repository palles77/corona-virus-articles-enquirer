Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly used anti-viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 was constructed. Possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted. This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2, new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies, and also possible new strategies for drug repositioning to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

But the disadvantage is that these therapies are too \"broad-spectrum\" and cannot kill coronaviruses in a targeted manner, and their side effects should not be underestimated. The second strategy is to use existing molecular databases to screen for molecules that may have therapeutic effect on coronavirus 19, 20 . High-throughput screening makes this strategy possible, and new functions of many drug molecules can be found through this strategy, for example, the discovery of anti-HIV infection drug lopinavir/ritonavir.

We conducted homology modeling to build all possible protein structures, including viral papain like protease (PLpro), main protease (3CLpro, also named 3-chymotrypsin-like protease), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, Spike, etc. Further, we used these proteins and human relative proteins [human ACE2 and type-II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) enzymes] as targets to screen ZINC U.

Among all coronaviruses from human, SARS-CoV (80%) exhibited the highest genome sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2. And MERS/isolate NL13845 also has 50% identity with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV is the most clearly studied one among all these viruses according to previous literatures. Structure and function of its most genome encoded proteins have been elucidated in recent years. In this study, because of high genome identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the structure and function prediction of SARS-CoV-2 genome encoded protein were mainly based on those researches on homology protein in SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 genome has 10 open reading frames (Fig. 2A). ORF1ab encodes replicase polyprotein 1ab. After cleaved by two proteases, replicase proteins showed multifunction involved in transcription and replication of viral RNAs. ORF2-10 encodes viral structural proteins such as S, M, N, and E proteins, and other auxiliary proteins. The S, M, E proteins are involved in the formation of the viral coat, and the N protein is involved in the packaging of the RNA genome (Fig. 2C). By aligning with the amino acid sequence of SARS PP1ab and analyzing the characteristics of restriction cleavage sites recognized by 3CLpro and PLpro, we speculated 14 specific proteolytic sites of 3CLpro and PLpro in SARS-CoV-2 PP1ab (Fig. 2B). PLpro cleaves three sites at 181-182, 818-819, and 2763-2764 at the N-terminus and 3CLpro cuts at the other 11 sites at the C-terminus, and forming 15 non-structural proteins. Among them, Nsp3 contains multiple domains, including a segment of SARS unique domain and a deubiquitination and proteolytic enzyme PLpro. Nsp5 is 3CLpro, Nsp12 is an RdRp, and Nsp13",

In vitro studies have shown that lopinavir and ritonavir can inhibit the replication of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV to exert anti-viral effects. The drug is listed as a recommended drug in the Anti-viral Drugs section of the New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program. The molecular docking results showed that ritonavir's possible target is Nsp3c or E-channel with the mfScores of -152.100 and -277.769, respectively. Lopinavir's possible target is Nsp3b, a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug, mainly for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections caused by influenza A and B viruses, etc. In recent years, many studies have proven its effectiveness against both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Arbidol hydrochloride can block virus replication by inhibiting the fusion of the lipid membrane of the virus with the host cells. Compared with the untreated control group, arbidol can effectively inhibit coronavirus up to 60 times at a concentration of 10-30 \u00b5mol/L, and significantly inhibit the virus's pathological effects on cells. The docking results of arbidol with the possible drug targets of the new coronavirus showed that it may interact with Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp14, Nsp15, E-channel, or Spike with the mfScores of -136.087, -118.253, -118.253, -117.879, and -145.125, respectively. Darunavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor that selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV-encoded Gag-Pol polyprotein in virally infected cells, thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles. At a concentration of 300 \u00b5mol/L, darunavir can significantly inhibit virus replication, and the inhibition efficiency is 280 times compared with the untreated group. Our docking results showed that the possible targets of darunavir are Nsp3c, PLpro, E-channel or Spike proteins with the mfScores of -126.149, -110.759, -157.184, and -111.865, respectively. Favipiravir, a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug, is used to treat flu. The Shenzhen Health Commission has now initiated clinical studies on the use of favipiravir to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. While, the scores of favipiravir docking with the targets in our virtual screening are relatively low. Chloroquine phosphate has been used in the treatment of malaria since the 1940s and later in rheumatoid arthritis. Chloroquine has been reported in some earlier studies to have direct anti-viral effects, such as inhibiting flavivirus, retrovirus (such as HIV), and many coronaviruses. Recent study showed that with EC 50 of 1.13 \u00b5mol/L and SI greater than 88, chloroquine can effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the cell level. Its efficiency in the human body for SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been clinically proven. Chloroquine phosphate was turned into chloroquine in the body to play therapeutic effect.

            "text": "options for treating life-threatening zoonotic coronavirus infections are very limited. Although the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012 triggered extensive research efforts, there are currently no drugs that can treat any zoonotic coronavirus. The transient nature of this epidemic is one of the major reasons why no prototypecoronavirus inhibitor has progressed to the (early) preclinical stage to date. As with the SARS virus 17 years ago and the current SARS-CoV-2, emerging coronaviruses in the future may continue to pose a threat to global public health. Therefore, finding broad-spectrum inhibitors that may reduce the effects of human coronavirus infection remains a challenging research focus. Given the time-consuming nature of anti-viral drug development and registration, existing treatments for other diseases may be the only fastest treatment option for emerging infectious diseases. For most of these drugs that have been prepared, the medication has sufficient experience and dosage, and their safety and ADME situation are well known.In this study, based on the results of bioinformatics analysis, 20 homology structures of 18 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 1 human protein were built, plus human ACE2 structure, totally 21 targets were setup for high throughput virtual ligand screening. The special double scoring system ICM-Pro soft allowed us to evaluate the docking results more accurately. The score of ICM software is calculated by the overall empirical function of predicted physical interaction, whiles the mfScore (mean force Score) is computed by the knowledge-based potential functions derived from statistics of ligand-receptor complex in PDB50,51 .From protein-protein docking results, we can deduce that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein have strong binding affinity to human ACE2, although weaker than that of SARS-CoV Spike protein. Unexpectedly, Bat-CoV RaTG13 Spike protein only has slightly weaker binding affinity with ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-2. It is speculated that the virus may be capable of infecting humans directly, or it is close. If SARS-CoV-2 evolved from Bat-CoV RaTG13, there may be no more than one or two host evolutionsinvolved. But there are no published articles that directly related to intermediate hosts yet. According to the most recent research paper on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection 52 , SARS-CoV-2 can spread rapidly by human-to-human transmission, this was consistent with observed protein-protein docking results of SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and human ACE2, for both of ours and previous prediction 25 . However, the fast growing incidents of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and related deaths implied the weaker binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike with human ACE2 compared to SARS Spike may not fully explained the current situation of this epidemic. There must have some other receptors of SARS-CoV-2 or infection facilitating mechanisms in the human host, or SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD may take other lower energy binding conformation different from current SARS-CoV Spike-RBD conformation found in the crystal structure, probably by induce fitting. These need to be further investigated.To search potential coronavirus therapeutic drugs as soon as possible, we first screened potential compounds from a ZINC drug database (2924 compounds) and a small in-house database of natural products (about 1066 compounds). A series of clinical drugs and natural products with anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects exhibited high binding affinity to different target proteins, indicating their potential utility for treating SARS-CoV-2.We have identified a number of compounds that might have anti-viral activity from the approved drugs library, such as anti-virus drugs (ribavirin, valganciclovir and thymidine), anti-bacterial drugs (cefpiramide, sulfasalazine, phenethicillin, lymecycline, demeclocycline, doxycycline, oxytetracycline and tigecycline), anti-asthmatic drugs (montelukast, fenoterol and reproterol), and hepatoprotective drug silybin. The original pharmacological actions of these drugs could be helpful for the therapy of viral infection pneumonia. The natural products, such as flavanoids like neohesperidin, hesperidin, baicalin, kaempferol 3deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide from Andrographis paniculata, and a series of xanthones from the plants of Swertia genus, with anti-virus, anti-bacteria and anti-inflammation activity could effectively interact with these targets of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the herbal medicines containing these compounds as major components might be meaningful for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.For ACE2 target, although several compounds could bind with ACE2 through virtual screening in our studies, no compound was found to bind with the contact surface of ACE2-Spike complex, suggesting that these compounds are only the inhibitors of ACE2 enzyme activities, rather than inhibitors of ACE2 driven virus infections. Just like what described in recently published research 53 , most of selected compounds are also unable to bind with the contact surface of ACE2-Spike complex. Actually, these potential ACE2 inhibitors may not be suitable to use as drugs for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection because the poor prognosis would be induced by the inhibition of ACE2 enzyme activities, for ACE2 was considered as a protective factor of lung injury54 .",

The molecular docking results show that ritonavir's possible target is Nsp3c or E-channel. Lopinavir's possible target is Nsp3b, Nsp3c, helicase, NRBD or E-channel. Some of these targets (such as Nsp3b, Nsp3c, E-channel) may be false positives due to the model inaccuracy for small flexible protein or partial model. For both lopinavir and ritonavir, we did not observe possible binding to major targets like 3CLpro, PLpro, RdRp, and so on. This docking result implies lopinavir and ritonavir tablets may not be suitable for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The results of the entire article are based on computer virtual screening.
