Formerly, large animals were primarily used for agricultural research or as models of human diseases. Over the past decade, ruminants have continued in their traditional agricultural research role but are now extensively used for studies in molecular biology, genetic engi-British stock with Egyptian and Indian goats. This breed is relatively heat tolerant and produces milk with the highest butterfat (about 4-5%). Fiber breeds include the Angora and the Cashmere. The Angora, the source of mohair, originated in Turkey. The Cashmere breed is found primarily in mountainous areas of Central Asia. The La Mancha, a newer breed of dairy goat first registered in the United States in 1958, has rudimentary ears that are a genetically dominant distinguishing characteristic of the breed. The meat breeds include the Boer, Sapel, Ma Tou, Kambling, and Pygmy. The Pygmy goat is small and is sometimes used for both meat and milk. The Mubend of Uganda and the Red Sokoto of West Africa produce quality skins for fine leather (Smith and Sherman, 1994) .",

Of breeds in temperate regions, Jerseys have been considered to be the most heat tolerant, but Holsteins have been found to adapt to warmer climates. There are many beef breeds. The more common in the United States include Angus (also called Aberdeen-Angus), Hereford (both polled and horned), and Simmental (Briggs and Briggs, 1980; Schmidt et al., 1988) .

Healthy, normal young ruminants serve as models of cardiac transplantation and as preclinical models for evaluation of cardiac assist or prosthetic devices, such as vascular stents and cardiac valves (Salerno et al., 1998) . For many years, ruminants have been useful research subjects for reproductive research, such as research on embryo transfer, artificial insemination, and control of the reproductive cycle (Wall et al., 1997) . Several important milestones in gene transfer, cloning, nuclear transfer, and genetic engineering techniques have been developed or demonstrated using these species (Ebert et al., 1994; Schnieke, 1997; Cibelli et al., 1998a,b) (see Fig. 1 ). One of many proposed uses of genetically engineered ruminants is the production of proteins that will be secreted in the milk and later isolated (Ebert et aL, 1994; Memon and Ebert, 1992) . Healthy sheep and goats are also often used for antibody production (Hanly et al., 1995) . Genome mapping developed rapidly during the 1990s; extensive information is available and is increasing for sheep and cattle (Broad et al., 1998; Womack, 1998) .",

Vaccination programs should be conducted with an awareness of duration of passive immunity and stresses in ruminants' lives (e.g., weaning, grouping, management changes, and shipping) that may impair immunity or increase susceptibility to infectious diseases.

There should be sufficient continuous-access waterers placed around the area to prevent competition or fighting. Feeders should be constructed to conform to species size and feeding characteristics and to prevent entrapment of head and limbs. Pens, other enclosures, passageways, chutes, and floors must be very sturdy to withstand such factors as the frequent cleaning; the strength, weight, and curiosity of all ages of animals; and the investigative and climbing behaviors of goats. Chain-link fences are dangerous because goats (as well as some breeds and ages of sheep) are curious and tend to stand on their hind legs against fencing or walls. Forelimbs may be caught easily in the mesh. Floors in any areas where animals will be housed, led, or herded must ensure secure footing at all times to prevent slipping injuries. All ruminants are social and herding animals. Therefore, they should be housed in groups or at least within eyesight and hearing of other animals. Singly housed animals should have regular human contact. Environmental enrichment should be governed by the experimental protocol or standard operating procedures, and durable play objects should be supplied to those animals that are housed in confinement. Calves, in particular, that must be singly housed or that have been recently weaned, need play objects (Morrow-Tesch, 1997) .",

There is a three-compartment forestomach (rumen, reticulum, and omasum) and a true stomach (abomasum). The mature rumen functions as an anaerobic fermentation chamber in which the enzymes, such as cellulase, of the resident bacteria allow the animals to prosper as herbivores. Digestion is also aided by other microorganisms, such as protozoa (105-106/ml) and bacteria (109-101~ that contribute to rumen fermentation. The result is the production of volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic, and butyric) . Unlike in the monogastrics, fermentative digestion and volatile fatty acid absorption also occur in the large intestines. The main sources of energy for ruminants are volatile fatty acids (VFAs) rather than glucose. Glucose is formed from propionic acid (or from amino acids) for metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS), uterus, and mammary glands. Plasma glucose in ruminants is much lower than and is regulated differently from that in nonruminants. The rumen microorganisms also synthesize vitamins, such as B and K, and provide protein that is used by the animals' systems. Large amounts of fermentation gases such as CO2 and methane, and small amounts of nitrogen, are naturally eructed (Hecker, 1983; Schimdt et al., 1988) .",

These references should be consulted when preparing to include blood collection data in research protocols and when reviewing hematologic findings. In addition, most veterinary diagnostic laboratories have also developed databases for normal ranges for hematologic and clinical chemistry values based on subjects from their service areas, and these may be useful as local and breed references. Appropriate control groups must be incorporated into each research plan, however, to establish the normal values (see Table I ) for the particular locale, diagnostic facilities, breed, age, sex, and research circumstances. Normal hematologic and clinical biochemistry data are presented in Tables II and III. Some general statements apply to most ruminants. Most ruminants have fewer neutrophils than lymphocytes. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values cannot be used as an indicator of renal function because of the metabolism of urea nitrogen by rumen microflora. Because of the large volume of rumen water, ruminants can generally go several days without drinking before significant dehydration occurs. Erythrocytes may become more fragile during rehydration, resulting in some degree of hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. Severe dehydration can occur quickly, however, in animals that are ill.

Computer programs are also readily available for those who may need to formulate and balance rations. The palatability of feeds should be taken into account. Mineral deficiencies and supplementation have been shown to influence several physiologic parameters such as immune function. Introduction of young stock should include continuation of the feeding program of the source or gradual transition to appropriate feed for the animals available in the region of the research facility (NRC, 1996) . Good-quality pasture can support ruminants under certain circumstances. Lush spring pastures, especially pastures containing alfalfa, can induce bloat, diarrhea, grass tetany, or nitrate poisoning. Ruminants not acclimated to lush pasture should be fed good-quality hay and slowly introduced to pasture environments.",

Goats are browsers and will readily eat grasses, as well as seeds, nuts, fruit, and woody-stemmed plants. Goats, however, can also be selective eaters and will only eat the leafy, more nutritious parts of the plant. Therefore, goats have a tendency to \"waste\" hay. Other eating habits should also be considered. Finely ground concentrates are not tolerated well by goats; pelleted concentrates are preferred because the goat will pick out large particles in mixes. Generally, goats do not prefer \"sweet\" feeds that contain molasses and do not need supplemental concentrates if a good-quality pasture or hay is fed. When given access to a salt block, goats generally are self-regulating. Grass-fed goats and lactating goats may need supplementation with calcium and phosphorus, whereas alfalfa-fed goats do not (Bretzlaff et al., 1991) . Horse and sheep feeds may be fed to goats provided that the feed does not contain much molasses (Bretzlaff et al., 1991) . The copper content of horse feed is not excessive for goats, as it is for sheep. Pelleted horse feeds with 25-28% fiber and 12-14% protein are good goat rations. Goats will consume 5-8% of body weight in dry-matter intake (whereas cattle will usually consume only 4% of body weight). Goats enjoy human contact, and small alfalfa cubes make tasty treats for the goat.",

In a research environment, ewes can be artificially stimulated to progress from anestrous to estrous cyclicity by maintaining the females in 8 hr of light and 16 hr of dark for 8-10 weeks. Puberty is reached at about 7-8 months (or earlier) in both rams and ewes; rams will typically reach puberty before their female counterparts. Ewes will display signs of estrus for about 24-30 hr and will ovulate spontaneously at the end of estrus. The estrous cycle length is 14-19 days, with an average of about 17 days.

It is often better and clearly more reliable to employ the help of a sterile ram to mark females when they are in standing heat. Two mating systems commonly employed include hand mating and group mating. With hand mating, ewes are placed either singly or in small groups with the ram of choice. Ewes are removed as serviced. Group mating involves placement of a mature ram with approximately 50-60 ewes for the entire 6-week breeding season.

The estrous cycle can be more erratic in the beginning than in the end of the breeding season (Smith, season (with winter delaying), and the level of nutrition (with higher levels hastening puberty). In some cases, the presence of mature cycling cows influences heifer puberty. With adequate nutrition, dairy breeds will reach puberty at 10-12 months and beef breeds at 11-15 months, and estrous cycles will occur regularly after the pubertal (first) estrus, Maturing heifers will often have one or more ovulations before showing overt signs of estrus. Only one follicle usually ovulates per estrous cycle (Hafez, 1987) Estrus, or standing heat, in cattle averages 12-16 hr in length, with a range of 6-24 hr (\"Large Animal Internal Medicine,\" 1996) . Detection of standing heat is important because it is closely related to the time of ovulation. Ovulation occurs approximately 25-32 hr after estrus. Detection of estrus is usually accomplished by visual observation of vaginal mucous discharge, mounting behavior by other females (i.e., the cow standing to be mounted is the individual in estrus), and receptivity to a bull (willingness to stand). Successful visual detection of standing heat is dependent on observation skills of handlers, knowledge of the herd, stresses (e.g., detection decreased in Bos taurus during heat stress), barn and yard surfaces (estrus detected better on dirt than on concrete), and maintaining a consistent observation schedule. Teaser animals outfitted with marking devices are also used. Other methods of detecting estrus include monitoring progesterone levels; glass slide and other evaluations of cervical mucus; change in vaginal pH; and body temperature changes (Hafez, 1987) . Estrous cycles are usually 21 days in length, with a range of 17-25 days. It is recommended that a heifer deliver her first calf by 2 years of age.",

If the pregnancy fails before this time, the cow will begin to cycle again between days 18-24, but if the pregnancy ends after day 17, there may be a delayed return to estrus. Realtime ultrasonography can be used to determine pregnancy as early as 9 days after insemination, with embyros seen by days 26-29. Fetal gender can also be determined by experienced personnel by this method by about day 55. Detection of pregnancy can be successful by 25-40 days after conception by observation of failure to return to estrus or by palpation per rectum (detecting fetal membrane slip by days 30-35 and/or amniotic vesicle by days 28-35). Palpation of the fetus is possible by day 65 and placentomes by approximately days 100-110. Palpation later in presumed pregnancy will provide information based on differences in size of the two uterine horns, changes in the uterine wall, and fremitus in the miduterine artery. Pregnancy can also be determined with reasonable success rates by determining if progesterone levels are elevated at days 20-24 after insemination. Levels of bovine pregnancy-specific protein B may also be measured; this is produced by trophoblastic cells and is detectable by days 15-24 and elevated throughout pregnancy.",

If possible, the dam should be confined to a birthing pasture or sanitized maternity pen a few days prior to parturition. The birthing environment will be very important in the overall health of the dam and offspring; stress minimization and a clean environment will benefit the immune health of both in the short and long term. Outdoor parturition in a small birthing pasture has advantages. There is less stress and less intensity of pathogens. Indoor maternity pens should be clean, dry, warm, well bedded, well ventilated but draft-free, and well lighted. Adequate space per pen minimizes losses of neonates from being stepped and sat on by the dam. Management of these pens, especially if concentrated in an area, is important to minimize pathogens to which dam and young are exposed. Water troughs or buckets should be elevated or placed outside the pen, because lambs and kids have a tendency to fall or be pushed into them. Soiled bedding should be removed from the birthing pen between dams, the area sanitized and allowed to dry, and fresh bedding installed for the next occupant. Moving the female immediately before or during parturition may delay the birthing process. In goats, furthermore, in utero death may occur if parturition is unduly delayed. Dams should be monitored closely during parturition for dystocias; these may result in loss of young or in young severely weakened from the prolonged birthing process.",

Most goats prefer to kid alone and do so unaided. Human interaction can actually interfere with normal birthing, especially in young or nervous does. Some does may reject kids if extensive human interference occurs. Does nearing parturition have an obviously swollen udder and a red, swollen vulva. Pelvic ligaments at the base of tail relax. The doe may circle to make a bed, get up and down, look at her tail or sides, push other goats away, and bleat softly. Signs of impending parturition include restlessness; vocalization (bleating softly); uneasiness, including getting up and down, pawing, and bedding; and a mucous discharge, leading to a moist tail. Eight to 12 hr prior to parturition, the cervix will dilate and the cervical mucous plug will be evident as a tan, smeared substance on the tail and perineum of the dam. Kids should present within 1-6 hr in either anterior or posterior position. A posterior presentation can be recognized by the presence of upward-pointing feet.

Administration of ACTH to a fetus, or administration to the dam, results in premature birth. Pregnancy is extended if fetal pituitary or adrenal glands are removed surgically. The fetal cortisol probably affects placental steroid production, accounting for sharp increases in the estrogens and estrogen precursors. Coincident with this, maternal progesterone levels fall. The rising levels of estrogen cause release of maternal PGF2~ and induction of oxytocin receptors. Most cows will separate themselves from the rest of the herd. A cow will lift her tail and arch her back when she is within a few hours of delivering the calf, and most cows are recumbent when delivering the calf. Typically, the whole birthing process takes about 100 min. The length of labor of cows carrying larger calves also will be longer. Nervous heifers will take longer to deliver, and if they are disturbed, their labor may cease. All postparturient animals should be monitored for successful passage of these fetal membranes within 12 hr of birth. Veterinary intervention is required if not. Cows occasionally eat placentas, which may subsequently obstruct rumen outflow and require surgical correction.

In a well-managed flock, many lambs and ewes will not need much assistance. When assistance is given, the newborn lamb's nose and mouth should be wiped free of secretions; gently swinging the lambs, head down, aids in removal of these fluids. The lamb should be dried off and stimulated through rubbing to aid its breathing. The lamb's navel should be dipped in an iodine solution to prevent subsequent navel infections. And the lamb should be identified by the application of an ear tag or ear notch. It is extremely important that the lamb be supplied with highquality colostrum within the first 12 hr of birth. Lambs that are not nursing on their own should be tube-fed with colostrum that has been collected and saved previously (i.e., frozen in ice cube trays) or collected from the mother after parturition. Passive transfer can be assessed by measuring serum y-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels (Tessman et al., 1997) . After the first few days, colostrum changes over to milk. Nursing lambs will ingest increasing amounts of milk as they grow. If the ewe cannot produce sufficient milk, the lamb should be \"grafted\" onto another ewe or fed artificially with a baby bottle. Powdered milk replacers are commercially available; the content of ewe milk is much different from that of cow's milk; thus lamb milk replacer should specifically be used. One report notes that 50-70% of lamb deaths occur during the first week of life and up to 90% occur within the first month. Good management of ewes during gestation, care of the lamb at parturition, application of an appropriate vaccination program, and observation and intervention within the first several weeks of a lamb's life will minimize losses (Ross, 1989) .",

            "text": "Because sheep are hormonally similar to other ruminants, estrous synchronization techniques are comparable. Progesterone suppresses follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion, preventing animals from developing follicles and exhibiting estrus. Artificial or natural progesterone can be administered in the feed, through parenteral injection, subcuticular implants, and vaginal pessaries. The progesterone is withdrawn in about 12-14 days, after which the FSH secretion will initiate the process of follicle development (Trower, 1993) . Estrus usually will occur in 36-60 hr (average is 48 hr). A natural method of synchronization, often applied to promote flock breeding within a short period of time (and thus parturition will be within a narrow window as well), is the introduction of sterile rams with the ewes before the beginning of the normal fall mating period. Pheromones released from males naturally stimulate the females to cycle and to synchronize their heats. It should be noted that introduction of a male during late anestrus will often stimulate ovulation in about 6 days; however, this cycle will generally be without clinical signs of estrus (silent heat). Vasectomy of rams is one method of producing sterile \"teaser rams.\"",

            "text": "Control of breeding in the goat has been studied mostly in dairy breeds in order to produce milk throughout the year and to reduce kidding labor. Goats in the luteal phase of the estrous cycle, days 4-16, are sensitive to PGF2~ (2.5-5 mg IM) and will show estrus in 36-60 hr postinjection (Bretzlaff, 1997) . Dosing cycling animals twice 11 days apart will synchronize goats, and artificial insemination using this method has resulted in 40-60% conception rates (Bretzlaff, 1997; Greyling and Van Niekerk, 1986) . Programs for timed breeding have been described and involve administering progestogens (Bretzlaff, 1997) . Vaginal pessaries of fluorogestone acetate left in place for 21 days in the doe followed by an injection of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) at the time of pessary removal have proven successful. Also, when primed by PGF2~, an 11day regimen of fluorogestone acetate with PMSG given on day 9 has been successful. Synchronization of cattle estrous cycles and superovulation are used as management techniques in certain commercial cattle and dairy production settings where estrus synchronization or embryo transfer is advantageous to production and management. The methodology is also used in the research setting for coordinating donors and recipients of embryos or other genetically manipulated tissues for implantation. The options and dosing regimens are described in detail in veterinary clinical texts (Wenzel, 1997; Vanderboom et al., 1997) . In synchronization, the principle is lysis of the existing corpus luteum. The more common practices involve the use of products approved for use in cattle such as PGF2~, one of its analogs, or products containing estradiol valerate. Progestogens are also used in conjunction with estradiol valerate. Other approaches, involving management techniques combined with pharmacologic interventions, are considered less successful. Superovulation regimens involve injections of FSH either alone or with PGF2~ at timed internals. Estrus is expected 48 hr after the final injection, and two inseminations are performed at 12 hr intervals after estrus detection. Preparation of recipients involves injection of PGF2~ or progestogens with gonadotropins such as PMSG. For greatest success as management tools, these must be combined with a consistent program that provides appropriate nutrition for all cattle involved. Synchronization of animals is also influenced by several other factors, however, such as time in the cycle when hormones are administered, response by each individual animal, whether the cow is a dairy or beef animal, parity and maturity of the cows, success of heat detection after the luteolysis, and accurate record keeping.",

About 75% of expected embryos (determined by counting corpora lutea) can be recovered; successful recovery is affected by factors such as age of the donor, reproductive health, and experience of the surgeon or technician. Furthermore, not all collected embryos are of transferable quality. Recipients are hormonally synchronized with the donor animals. On the day of embryo collection, transferable embryos are implanted into the uterus of the recipient; laparoscopy has been used in the past and is now being replaced by nonsurgical methods.

The meat, or \"downs,\" breeds tend to be less gregarious, and the long-wooled breeds tend to be solitary (Ross, 1989; ASIA, 1996) . Nonetheless, movement of animals is simplified by proper facility design. Sheep have a wide-angle visual field and are easily scared by activities that are taking place behind them. Sheep should be moved slowly and gently. To capture individuals within a flock, it is best to confine the flock to a smaller space and use a shepherd's crook or to gently catch the animal in front of the neck/thorax. Grabbing the wool can injure the animals, as well as damage the wool and the underlying tissues. Sheep move best in chutes that have solid walls, and individual animals will generally follow a lead animal. Any escape route will be challenged and, if successfully breached, will disrupt the entire flock movement. Sheep movement is also disrupted by contrasts such as light and shadows that impinge on a chute or corral. Finally, like most animals, sheep have a flight zone (minimum zone of comfort), the penetration of which will result in sheep scattering. This minimal flight distance can be modified by increasing handling of the animals and working at the edge of the zone, but it should always be considered when working with animals in chutes, pens, or other confined areas.",

Goats are also inquisitive, restless, agile jumpers and climbers, and quite mischievous. If maintained in paddocks, strong high fences are essential, as are adequate spaces for exercise or boulders or rock piles for hoof maintenance and recreational climbing. Goats are more tolerant of isolation and are more easily acclimated to human contact than sheep are, but goats will confront unfamiliar intruders and make sneezing noises. Goats with horns will use them to advantage, and horns may also become entangled in fencing. Although less strongly affected by flock behavior, goats are social animals.

Because of ruminant digestive and metabolic needs, much of the day is spent eating or cud chewing. Occasionally, adult cows sit upright like dogs. Cattle maintained inside tend to be more docile.

Rams will also be infected and may develop orchitis or pneumonia. The disease caused by B. ovis is manifested by clinical or subclinical infection of the epididymis, leading to epididymal enlargement and testicular atrophy. Brucella ovis causes decreased fertility. Brucella melitensis is the more common cause of brucellosis in goats. Brucella abortus has been shown to infect goats in natural and experimental infections, and B. ovis has also been shown to infect goats experimentally. Does infected with B. melitensis will also abort during the third trimester. Infections with B. abortus in cattle produce few clinical signs. There may be a brief septicemia during which organisms are phagocytosed by neutrophils and fixed macrophages in lymph nodes. In cows, the organism localizes in supramammary lymph nodes and udders and in the endometrium and placenta of pregnant cows. Infection may cause abortions after the fifth month, with resulting retained placentas. Permanent infection of the udder is common and results in shedding of organisms in milk.

Most states are considered brucellosis-free in the cattle populations; thus, procurement of ruminants that have been exposed to this infectious agent will be unlikely. Cattle vaccination programs can be very successful when conducted on a herd basis to reduce likelihood of exposure. Strain 19 and the recently validated attentuated strain RB51 are live vaccines and can be used in healthy heifer calves 4-12 months old. Vaccination for older animals may be done under certain circumstances. Vaccination of bull calves is not recommended, because of low likelihood of spread through semen and possibility of vaccination-induced orchitis. The strain 19 vaccine induces long-term cell-mediated immunity, protects a herd from abortions, and protects the majority of a herd from reactors during a screening and culling program. The vaccine will not, however, protect the animals from becoming infected with B. abortus.",

Leptospirosis is a contagious but uncommon disease in sheep and goats. The disease may cause abortion, anemia, hemoglobinuria, and icterus and is often associated with a concurrent fever. After a 4-to 10-day incubation period, the organism enters the bloodstream and causes bacteremia, fever, and red-cell hemolysis. Leptospiremia may last up to 7 days. Immune stimulation is apparently rapid, and antibodies are detectable at the end of the first week of infection; crossserovar protection does not occur. During active bacteremia, hemolysis may result in hemoglobin levels of 50% below normal. Hyperthermia, hemoglobinuria, icterus, and anemia may be observed during this phase, and ewes in late gestation may abort. Abortion usually occurs only once. Mortality rates of above 50% have been reported in infected ewes and lambs (Jensen and Swift, 1982) . Subclinical infection is more common in nonpregnant and nonlactating animals. Sheep infected with leptospirosis may display a hemolytic crisis associated with IgM acting as a cold-reacting hemagglutinin. Acute and chronic infections in cattle are more common than infections in sheep and goats. Acute forms in cattle display signs similar to those in sheep. Acute infection in calves may progress to meningitis and death. Lactating cows will have severe drops in production. Chronic cases may lead to abortion, with retained placenta, and weakened calves or animals that carry the infection. Infertility may also be a sequela.",

The overall case rate is low. The disease may present as an isolated case or with multiple animals affected. Three forms of disease are described: encephalitis, placentitis with abortion, and septicemia with hepatitis and pneumonia. The encephalitic form is most common in sheep; septicemic forms may occur in neonatal lambs (Scarratt, 1987) . Clinically, the encephalitic form begins with depression, anorexia, and mild hyperthermia after an incubation period of 2-3 weeks. As the disease progresses, animals exhibit nasal discharges and conjunctivitis and begin to walk in circles, as if disoriented. Facial paralytic lesions, including drooping of an ear or eyelid, dilation of a nostril, or strabismus occur unilaterally on the affected side as the result of dysfunction of some or all the cranial nerves V-XII. The neck will by flexed away from the affected side. Facial muscle twitching, protrusion of the tongue, dysphagia, hypersalivation, and nasal discharges may be noted. The hypersalivation may lead to metabolic acidosis in advanced cases in cattle. Anorexia, prostration, coma, and death follow. The placental form usually results in last-trimester abortions in ewes and does, which typically survive this form of the disease. The affected females may be asymptomatic or may show severe clinical signs such as fever and depression, with subsequent retained placenta or endometritis. Abortion usually occurs within 2 weeks of Listeria infection. In cattle, abortion occurs during the last 2 months of gestation and has been induced experimentally 6-8 days after exposure. Cows present with the range of clinical signs seen in smaller-ruminant dams. There is no long-term effect on the fertility of affected dams.",

The most common bovine mastitis pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, and S. uberis; coliform agents such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; mycoplasmal species such as Mycoplasma bovis, M. bovigenitalium, M. californicum, M. canadensis, and M. alkalescens; and Salmonella spp. such as S. typhimurium, S. newport, S. enteritidis, S. dublin, and S. muenster. Many of these agents such as Staphylococcus spp., Salmonella spp., and the coliforms can cause both acute and chronic mastitis, as well as severe systemic disease, including fever and anorexia. These must be regarded as herd and environmental pathogens in terms of treatment and prevention. The pathogenesis of staphylococcal infections is comparable to that in goats. Staphylococcus agalactiae can be cleared from udders because it does not invade other tissues, is an obligate resident of the glands, and is susceptible to penicillin. In contrast, S. uberis and S. dysgalactiae are environmental organisms and can be highly resistant to pencillin. Mycoplasma bovis is the more common of the mycoplasmal pathogens and can cause severe infections.

Younger, disease-free animals should be milked first; any animals with diagnosed problems should be milked after the rest of the herd and/or segregated during treatment. Milkers' hands easily serve as a means of pathogen transmission, and wearing rubber gloves is recommended. Teat and udder cleaning practices include washing and drying with single-service paper or cloth towels or pre-and postmilking dipping. Milking equipment must be maintained to provide proper vacuum levels and pumping rates, and liners should be the appropriate size. Facilities that provide clean and dry areas for the animals to rest, feed, and move will diminish teat injuries and reduce exposures to mastitis pathogens. In that regard, inorganic bedding such as clean sand harbors few pathogens in contrast to shavings and sawdust.",

The respiratory form is known as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, and clinical signs may range from mild to severe, the latter particularly when there are additional respiratory viral infections or secondary bacterial infections. The mortality rate in more mature cattle is low, however, unless there is secondary bacterial pneumonia. Fever, anorexia, restlessness, hyperemia of the muzzle, gray pustules on the muzzle (that later form plaques), nasal discharge (that may progress from serous to mucopurulent), hyperpnea, coughing, salivation, conjunctivitis with excessive epiphora, and decreased production in dairy animals are typical signs. Open-mouth breathing may be seen if the larynx or nasopharygneal areas are blocked by mucopurulent discharges. Neonatal calves may develop respiratory as well as general systemic disease. In these cases, in addition to the symptoms already noted, the soft palate may become necrotic, and gastrointestinal tract ulceration occurs. Young calves are most susceptible to the encephalitic form; signs include dull attitude, head pressing, vocalizations, nystagmus, head tilt, blindness, convulsions, and coma, as well as some signs, such as discharges, seen with respiratory tract presentations. This form is usually fatal within 5 days. Abortion may occur simultaneously with the conjunctival or respiratory tract diseases, when the respiratory infection appears to be mild, or may be delayed by as much as 3 months after the respiratory tract disease signs. Infectious pustular vulvovaginitis is most commonly seen in dairy cows, and clinical signs may be mild and not noticed. Otherwise, signs are fever, depression, anorexia, swelling of the vulvar labia, vulvar discharge, and vestibular mucosa reddened by pustules. The cow will often carry her tail elevated away from these lesions. These soon coalesce, and a fibrous membrane covers the ulcerated area. If uncomplicated, the infection lasts about 4-5 days, and lesions heal in 2 weeks. Younger infected bulls may develop balanoposthitis with edema, swelling, and pain such that the animals will not service cows.",

Clinically, animals exhibit signs of progressive pulmonary disease after an extremely long incubation period of up to 2 years. Respiratory rate and dyspnea gradually increase as the disease progresses. The animal continues to eat throughout the disease; however, animals progressively lose weight and become weak. Additionally, mastitis is a common clinical feature. Thoracic auscultation reveals consolidation of ventral lung Pathogenesis. The virus has a predilection for the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, udder, spleen, joints, and rarely the brain. After initial infection, the virus integrates into the DNA of mature monocytes and persists as a provirus.

Transmission can also be by inadvertent exposure (e.g., contaminated syringes) of ruminants to the modified live vaccines developed for use in swine.

Rabies should be included on the differential list when clinical signs of neurologic disease are evident. Other differentials for ruminants include herpesvirus encephalitis, thromboemobolic meningoencephalitis, nervous ketosis, grass tetany, and nervous cocciodiosis.",

The profound impact of this disease on the cattle industry in Great Britain during the past two decades is well known. The disease may be caused by a scrapielike (prion) agent. It is believed that the source of infection for cattle was feedstuff derived from sheep meat and bonemeal that had been inadequately treated during processing. The incubation period of years, the lack of detectable host immune response, the debilitating and progressive neurological illness, and the pathology localized to the central nervous system are characteristics of the disease, and are is comparable to the characteristics of other TSE diseases such as scrapie, which affects sheep and goats. In addition, the infectious agent is extremely resistant to dessication and disinfectants. Confirmation of disease is by histological examination of brain tissue collected at necropsy; the vacuolation that occurs during the disease will be symmetrical and in the gray matter of the brain stem. Molecular biology techniques, such as Western blots and immunohistochemistry, may also be used to identify the presence of the prion protein. Differentials include many infectious or toxic agents that affect the bovine nervous and musculoskeletal systems, such as rabies, listeriosis, and lead poisoning. Metabolic disorders such as ketosis, milk fever, and grass tetany are also differentials. There is no vaccine or treatment. Prevention focuses on import regulations and not feeding ruminant protein to ruminants; recent USDA regulations prohibit feeding any mammalian proteins to ruminants.",

The disease is characterized by yellow, semifluid to watery diarrhea occurring 1-4 days after infection. The disease can progress to dehydration, anorexia and weight loss, acidosis, depression, and occasionally death. The virus is ingested with contaminated feed and water and selectively infects and destroys the enterocytes at the tips of the small intestinal villi. The villi are replaced with immature cells that lack sufficient digestive enzymes; osmotic diarrhea results. Virus may remain in the environment for several months. The disease is diagnosed by virus isolation, electron microscopy of feces, fecal fluorescent antibody, fecal ELISA tests (marketed tests generally detect group A rotavirus), and fecal latex agglutination tests. Rotavirus diarrhea is treated by supportive therapy, including maintaining hydration, electrolyte, and acid-base balance.

Most clinical signs occur during the 4-to 9-day developmental stage, with hemolytic anemia being common. Death is most likely to occur at this stage or at the beginning of the convalescent stage. Death may also occur from anoxia, because of the animal's inability to handle any exertion or stress, especially if treatment is initiated when severe anemia exists. Reticulocytosis characterizes the convalescent stage, which may continue for many weeks. Morbidity is high, and mortality is low.

In most cases, the disease is well established by the time clinical signs are seen. Oocysts must undergo sporulation over a 3-to 10-day period in the environment. After ingestion of the sporulated oocysts, sporozoites are released and penetrate the intestinal mucosa and form schizonts.

The intermediate hosts develop nonclinical systemic infections, with tachyzoites in several organs, and parasites then localize and become encysted in particular tissues, especially the brain. Infections of this type are latent and lifelong. Except when immunocompromised, most cattle do not usually develop clinical signs and do not have fetal loss. Fetuses become infected, leading to fetal death, mid-gestation abortions, or live calves with latent infections or congenital brain disease.

Ingested zoites invade epithelial cells and eventually undergo sexual reproduction, resulting in new oocysts, which the cats will shed in the feces. Cats rarely show clinical signs of infection. One cat can shed millions of oocysts in 1 gm of feces, but the asymptomatic shedding takes place for only a few weeks in its life. Oocysts sporulate in cat feces after 1 day. Ruminants are intermediate hosts of toxoplasmosis and become infected by ingesting sporulated oocyst-contaminated water or feed. As in the definitive host, the ingested sporozoite invades epithelial cells within the intestine but also further invades the bloodstream and is transported throughout the host. The organism migrates to tissues such as the brain, liver, muscles, and placenta. Placental infection develops about 14 days after ingestion of the oocysts. The damage caused by an infection is due to multiplication within cells. Toxoplasma does not produce any toxin. Campylobacter, Chlamydia, and Q fever. Prevention and control. Feline populations on source farms should be controlled. Eliminating contamination of feed and water with cat feces is the best preventive measure.

Hypobiotic (arrested) larvae may exist for several months in animal tissues, serving as a reservoir for future pasture contamination. Periparturient increases in egg shedding by ewes contribute to large numbers of eggs spread on spring pastures (\"spring rise\"). Resistance to common anthelmintics has developed; currently ivermectin or benzimidazole products are used, with a minimum of 2 dosings given 2-3 weeks apart. Levamisole is also used.

In 2-10 months, the larvae complete their growing phase, migrate back to the nasal cavity, and are sneezed out. The mature larvae penetrate the soil and pupate for 1-1.5 months and emerge as botflies. Clinically, early in the disease course, animals display unique behaviors such as stamping, snorting, sneezing, and rubbing their noses against each other or objects. Hypersensitivity to the larvae occurs (Dorchies et al., 1998) . Later, mucopurulent nasal discharges associated with the larval-induced inflammation of mucosal linings will be observed. At necropsy, larvae will be observed in the nasal cavity or sinuses. Mild inflammatory reactions, mucosal thickening, and exudates will accompany the larvae. The disease is diagnosed by observing the behaviors or identifying organisms at necropsy. Up to 80% of a flock will potentially be infected; treatment should be employed on the rest of the flock.

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is an autosomal recessive disease of cattle seen primarily in Holsteins, Herefords, and Shorthorns. The disease also occurs in Limousin cattle, humans, and some other species. In the homozygous recessive animal, symptoms of the disease may vary from mild to severe and occur at different times of the year and in different ages of animals. A reddish brown discoloration of teeth and bones is a characteristic of the disease, as is discolored urine, general weakness and failure to thrive, photosensitization, and photophobia. Bones are more fragile compared with bones of normal animals. A regenerative anemia occurs as the result of the shortened life span of erythrocytes, due to accumulations of porphyrins. The genetic defect is associated with low activity of an essential enzyme, uroporphyrinogen III synthase, in the porphyrin-heme synthesis pathway in erythrocytic tissue. The ranges in the presentation of the disease are believed to be related to varying cycles of porphyrin synthesis. Porphyrins are excreted in varying amounts in the urine and the discoloration fluoresces under a Wood's lamp.

Radiologically, secondary ossification centers--especially the physis, subchondral areas, and cuboidal bonesmare affected. Abnormal endochondral ossification leads to excess cartilage formation, notably apparent in the elbows. Lambs will typically display abnormally long limbs, medial deviation of the carpus and tarsus, flattening of the sternum, scoliosis/kyphosis of the vertebrae, and a rounded nose. Muscle atrophy is common. Diagnosis can be based on typical clinical signs, which are similar to those seen with Marfan syndrome in humans (Rook et al., 1986) .

Concurrent disease, such as salmonellosis, bluetongue, or overuse of anti-inflammatory drugs, or recent shipping or environmental stresses may also lead to ulcer formation. Copper deficiency, dietary changes, mycotic infections, Clostridium perfringens abomasitis, and abomasal bezoars are associated with this disease in calves. In older adult cattle, abomasal lymphosarcoma may be the underlying condition. Gastric acid hypersecretion in conjunction with insufficient gastric mucous secretion will physically destroy the gastric epithelium. Deep ulceration may cause serious hemorrhage and/or perforation with peritonitis. Chronic hemorrhage may lead to anemia. Although ulcers are often asymptomatic in calves, perforation with peritonitis is more common than hemorrhage. Dark feces or melena and abdominal pain may be observed. Arched back, restlessness, kicking at the abdomen, bruxism, and anorexia are common signs of abdominal pain. Fecal occult blood is as an easy diagnostic test. Treatment includes gastrointestinal protectants and histamine antagonists. Anemia may be symptomatically treated with parenteral iron injections and anabolic steroids.

Displaced abomasum (DA) is a sporadic disorder usually associated with multiparous 4-to 7year-old dairy cows in early lactation, but the condition can occur even in young calves. Displacement to the right (RDA) may be further complicated by torsion (RTA), a surgical emergency. Left displacement (LDA) is more common than RDA. Clinical signs include anorexia, lack of cud chewing, decreased frequency of ruminal contractions, shallow respirations, increased heart rate, treading, and decreased milk production. Diagnosis is based on characteristic areas of tympanic resonance during auscultation-percussion of the lateral to lateral-ventral abdomen (\"pings\"), ruminal displacement palpated per rectum, and clinical signs. Cow-side clinical chemistry findings include hypoglycemia and ketonuria; more extensive evaluations will often indicate moderate to severe electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities. DA occurs because of gas accumulation within the viscus, and the abomasum \"floats\" up from its normal ventral location to the lateral abdominal wall. No exact cause of DA has been identified, but it is commonly associated with stress; high levels of concentrate in the diet, leading to forestomach atony; and many disorders, including lack of regular exercise, mastitis, hypocalcemia, retained placenta, metritis, or twins. Factors such as body size and conformation indicate the possibility of genetic predisposition. Treatments include surgical and nonsurgical techniques for LDA; the former has a better chance of per-manent correction. Emergency surgery is necessary for RTA; the disorder is fatal within 72 hr. Recurrence is rare after surgical correction. Electrolyte and acid-base imbalances are likely in severe cases and especially with RTA. Prevention includes reducing stress, taking greater care in the introduction and feeding of concentrates, and reducing incidence of predisposing diseases noted above (Rohrbach et al., 1999) .",

Factors in the development of the condition include negative energy balance related to the normal decreased dry matter intake as parturition approaches; hormonal changes associated with parturition; and concurrent diseases of parturition that decrease feed intake and increase energy needs. The possible concurrent diseases include metritis, retained fetal membranes, mastitis, parturient paresis, and displaced abomasum. Signs are nonspecific and include depression, anorexia, and weakness. Prognosis is usually guarded. Diagnosis is based on herd management, the animal's condition, ketonuria, and clinical signs. In prepartum cattle and in lactating cows, blood levels of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) greater than 1000 ~tEq/liter and 325-400 ~tEq/liter, respectively, are abnormal (Gerloff and Herdt, 1999) . Triglyceride analysis of liver biposy specimens are useful. In affected cows, body fat is mobilized, in the form of NEFA in response to the energy demands. Hepatic lipidosis occurs rapidly as the NEFA are converted into hepatic triglycerides. The ability of the liver to extract the albumin-bound NEFA from the blood is better than that of other tissues that need and can also use NEFA as an energy source. Treatment for any concurrent diseases must be pursued aggressively, as well as measures to increase and stabilize blood glucose, decrease NEFA production, and increase forestomach digestion to improve production of normally metabolized volatile fatty acids. Therapeutic measures include intravenous glucose drips, insulin (NPH or Lente) injections every 12 hr, and transfaunation of ruminal fluid from a normal cow. Prevention includes minimizing stress to lategestation cows. Dry and lactating cows should be maintained separately; their energy, protein, and dry matter requirements are very different.

            "text": "i. Bloat. Bloat or tympanites refers to an excessive accumulation of gas in the rumen. The condition most frequently occurs in animals that have been recently fed abundant quantities of succulent forages or grains. Bloat is classified into two broad categories: frothy bloat and free-gas bloat. Frothy bloat is associated with ingestion of feeds that produce a stable froth that is not easily expelled from the rumen. Fermentation gases such as CO2, CH4, and minor gases such as N2, 02, H2, and H2S incorporate into the froth, overdistend the rumen, and eventu-ally compromise respiration by limiting diaphragm movement. The froth is often derived from a combination of salivary mucoproteins, protozoal or bacterial proteins, and proteins, pectins, saponins, or hemicellulose associated with ingested leaves or grain. Typical foodstuffs that cause frothy bloat include green legumes, leguminous hay (alfalfa, clover), or grain (especially barley, corn, and soybean meal). Free-gas bloat is less related to feeds ingested; rather, it is caused by rumen atony or by physical or pathological problems that prevent normal gas eructation. Some examples of causes of free-gas bloat are esophageal obstructions (foreign bodies, tumors, abscesses, and enlarged cervical or thoracic lymph nodes), vagal nerve paralysis or injury, and central nervous system conditions that affect eructation reflexes. Clinically, the animal will exhibit rumen distension, and tympany will be observed in the left paralumbar fossa. Additional signs may include colic-like pain of the abdomen and dyspnea. Passage of a stomach tube helps to differentiate between free-gas bloat and frothy bloat; and with free-gas bloat, expulsion of gas through the stomach tube aids in treatment of the disorder. Once rumen distension is alleviated with free-gas bloat, the underlying cause must be investigated to prevent recurrence. Frothy bloat is more difficult to treat, because the foam blocks the stomach tube. Addition of mineral oil, household detergents, or antifermentative compounds via the tube may help break down the surface tension, allowing the gas to be expelled. In acute, life-threatening cases of bloat, treatment should be aimed at alleviating rumen distension by placing a trocar or surgical rumenotomy into the rumen via the paralumbar fossa. Limiting the consumption of feedstuffs prone to induce bloat can prevent the disease. Additionally, poloxalene or monensin will decrease the incidence of frothy bloat.",

            "text": "ii. Lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis, or rumen acidosis, is an acute metabolic disease caused by engorgement of grains or other highly fermentable carbohydrate sources. The disease is most frequently related to a rapid change in diet from one containing high roughage to one containing excessive carbohydrates. Diet components that predispose to acidosis include common feed grains; feedstuffs such as sugar beets, molasses, and potatoes; by-products such as brewer's grains; and bakery products. Biochemically, ingestion of large amounts of the carbohydrate-rich diet causes the normally gram-negative rumen bacterial populations to shift to gram-positive Streptococcus and Lactobacillus species. The gram-positive organisms efficiently convert the starches to lactic acid. The lactic acid acidifies the rumen contents, leading to rumen mucosal inflammation, and increases the osmolality of rumen fluids, leading to sequestration of fluids and osmotic attraction of plasma and tissue fluid to the rumen. Lactic acid-induced rumenitis predisposes the animal to ulcers, to liver abscesses from \"absorbed\" bacterial pathogens, to laminitis from absorbed toxins, and to polioencephalomalacia from the inability of the new rumen bacterial populations to produce sufficient thiamine needed to maintain normal nervous system function. Clinically, animals will become anorexic, depressed, and weak within 1-3 days after the initial insult. Incoordination, ataxia, dehydration, hemoconcentration, rapid pulse and respiration, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and lameness will also be noted 9 Rumen distension and an acetone-like odor to the breath, milk, or urine may also be observed. Diagnosis is based on history and clinical signs. Blood, urine, or milk ketones can be detected (Moore and Ishler, 1997) . Additionally, rumen pH, which is normally above 6.0, will drop to less than 5.0 and in severe cases may achieve levels as low as 3.8. Similarly, urine pH will become acidic, blood pH will drop below 7.4, and hematocrit will appear to increase due to the relative hemoconcentration. Necropsy findings will be determined by secondary conditions. The primary lactic acidosis will cause swelling and necrosis of rumen papillae and abomasal hemorrhages and ulcers. Treatment must be applied early in the syndrome. In early hours of severe carbohydrate engorgement, rumenotomy and evacuation of the contents are appropriate. The 9",

Clinically, animals may exhibit only poor rates of gain, due to changes in the absorptive capacity of the injured mucosa. At necropsy, papillae will be thickened and rough.

Clinically, the animals will appear depressed and anorexic. Rumen motility will be decreased, and animals will lose weight. The disease may resolve in a week to 10 days; mortality may reach 20%.

Propionic acid is absorbed and selectively converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis. When the animal is in a state of negative energy balance, it hydrolyzes fats to glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is converted to glucose while the fatty acids are metabolized for energy. The oxidation of fatty acids in the face of declining oxaloacetate levels (required for normal Krebs cycle function) results in the formation of ketone bodies (acetone, acetoacetic acid, and [3-hydroxybutyric acid), thus causing the condition ketoacidosis.",

Cows are affected within 24-48 hr before or after parturition. Cows initially are weak and show evidence of muscle tremors, then deteriorate to sternal recumbency, with the head usually tucked to the abdomen, and an inability to stand. Tachycardia, dilated pupils, anorexia, hypothermia, depression, ruminal stasis, bloat, uterine inertia, and loss of anal tone are also seen at this stage.

In slightly older animals, the disease is characterized by locomotor disturbances and/or circulatory failure.

Paresis and sudden death in neonates with associated pathological signs are frequently diagnostic. With the skeletal form, affected animals are stiff and reluctant to move, and muscles of affected animals are painful. Young will be reluctant to get up but will readily nurse when assisted.

Primary photosensitization is related to uncommon plant pigments or to drugs such as phenothiazine, sulfonamides, or tetracyclines. Secondary photosensitization is more common in large animals and is specifically related to the plant pigment phylloerythrin. Phylloerythrin, a porphyrin compound, is a degradation product of chlorophyll released by rumen microbial digestion. Liver disease or injury, which prevents normal conjugation of phylloerythrin and excretion through the biliary system, predisposes to photosensitization. The only example of aberrant photosensitization is congenital porphyria of cattle (see Section III,B,1). Pathologically, the photosensitive chemical is deposited in the skin and is activated by absorbed sunlight. The activated pigments transfer their energy to local proteins and amino acids, which, in the presence of oxygen, are converted to vasoactive substances. The vasoactive substances increase the permeability of capillaries, leading to fluid and plasma protein losses and eventually to local tissue necrosis. Photosensitization can occur within hours to days after sun exposure and produces lesions of the face, vulva, and coronary bands; lesions are most likely to occur on white-haired areas. Initially, edema of the lips, corneas, eyelids, nasal planum, face, vulva, or coronary bands occurs. The facial edema, nostril constriction, and swollen lips potentially lead to difficulty in breathing. With secondary photosensitization, icterus is also common. Necrosis and gangrene may occur. Diagnosis is based on clinical lesions and exposure to the photosensitive chemi-cals and sunlight. Treatment is symptomatic. The prognosis for hepatogenous type may be guarded if hepatic disease is severe. from excessive straining associated with dysuria from the pressure of the fetuses and/or abdominal contents on the bladder. If the prolapse obstructs subsequent urination, rupture of the bladder may occur. The vaginal prolapse can be reduced and repaired if discovered early, and techniques in small and large ruminants are comparable. The animal should be restrained, and the prolapsed tissue should be cleansed with disinfectants. Best done under epidural anesthesia, the vagina is replaced into the pelvic canal and the vulvar or vestibular opening is sutured closed (Buhner suture). Alternatively, a commercial device called a bearing retainer (or truss) can be placed into the reduced vagina and tied to the wool, thereby holding the vagina in proper orientation without interfering with subsequent lambing.",

Cows may also have concurrent parturient paresis. Initially, the tissue will appear normal, but edema and environmental contamination or injuries of the tissue develop quickly. Clinical signs will include increased pulse and respiratory rates, straining, restlessness, and anorexia. If identified early, the uterus can be replaced as for vaginal prolapses. Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected if present. Additional supportive therapy, including the use of antibiotics should always be considered. Tetanus prophylaxis should be included. Oxytocin should be administered to induce uterine reduction. Vaginal closures are less successful at retaining uterine prolapses.

The physical eversion of the rectum through the anal sphincter is usually secondary to other diseases or management-related circumstances. Rectal prolapses may occur secondary to gastrointestinal infection or inflammation, especially when the colon is involved. Diseases that cause tenesmus, such as coccidiosis, salmonellosis, and intestinal worms, may result in prolapse. Urolithiasis may result in prolapses as the animal strains to urinate. Any form of cystitis or urethritis, vaginal irritation, or vaginal prolapse and some forms of hepatic disease may lead to rectal prolapse. Abdominal enlargement related to advanced stages of pregnancy, excessive rumen filling or bloat, and overconditioning may cause prolapse.

Fasciola hepatica infections are primarily seen in Gulf Coast and western states. Fascioloides magna infections are typically seen in Gulf, Great Lake, and northwestern states, where ruminants share pasture with deer, elk, and moose. Dicrocoelium dendriticum infections occur only in New York State. Liver fluke eggs are passed in the bile and feces and hatch in 2-3 weeks to form the freeswimming miracidia. It is important to note that each fluke egg represents the source of eventually thousands of cercariae or metacercariae. The miracidia penetrate the body of an intermediate host (usually freshwater snails) and develop through sporocyst and redia stages, finally forming cercariae. (Dicrocoelium is unique because it utilizes a land snail that expels slime balls, each containing several hundred cercariae. These are eaten by a second intermediate host, the ant Formica fusca.)",

Cooperia primarily affects younger animals less than 1 year of age. Cooperia curticei infects the small intestine of sheep and goats; C. punctata and C. oncophora infect the small intestines of cattle, sheep, and goats. Cooperia pectinata infects the stomach of cattle. Large numbers lead to clinical infection, and the prepatent period is about 3 weeks. Cooperia and Osteragia infections, like infections of some other nematode species, may act synergistically. Because these nematodes suck blood, clinical signs include anemia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and malnutrition. Animals exhibit weight loss, diarrhea, and depression.
