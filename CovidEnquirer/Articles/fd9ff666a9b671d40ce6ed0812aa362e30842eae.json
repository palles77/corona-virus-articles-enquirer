A new screening test is applying for FDA approval. The owners of the test say that they can increase the length of survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. Their studies show that by diagnosing it 6 months earlier than any other test, they can increase the length of survival with the disease. The FDA approval panel responds that this test has what type of bias? A. Confounding B. Hawthorne effect C. Misclassification D. Lead-time E. Length 10. A hospital administrator wants to conduct a study to investigate the benefits of a hand soap that promises to reduce iatrogenic hospital infections. She decides to enroll 400 nurses in the study. The study is designed so that half of the nurses are instructed to use the new soap, while the other half are instructed to use the old soap. To ensure that the nurses are using soap, the preventive medicine physician on staff is to randomly give the nurses a \"sniff test\" to make sure their hands smell like soap. Because the preventive medicine physician only works on the first floor, he is only able to sniff nurses that work on the first floor. The nurses on the second floor are never subjected to the sniff test. When the study results are tabulated, it is found that there is no difference between iatrogenic infections between the new soap and old soap. However, it is found that there were more iatrogenic infections on the second floor than the first.",

This is because slower moving diseases are more likely to be detected since the subject is alive for longer. To the contrary, diseases that cause mortality sooner are less likely to be detected. Length bias is often confused with lead-time bias. Lead-time bias occurs when the diagnosis is made earlier and creates the illusion that the subject lived longer than if the diagnosis were made later. If a subject with a terminal disease is diagnosed 1 month earlier, he will still die at the same time. However, the records will indicate that he lived one month later with the earlier diagnosis. 8. E. Randomly assigning 1000 study participants to separate arms in a study Nondifferential error/bias is also called random error, or chance error. If a sample is has equal amounts of error on both sides of the true value, the error will cancel out and the overall value will closely approximate the true value. Differential error/bias produces deviation in one direction from the true value, either above or below. Answers A, B, C, and D are all examples of differential bias. All of these answers target only one of the two populations that should be interrogated equally. In answer \"A,\" only the men and not the women are questioned about marital happiness. In answer \"B,\" the CHF patients that have been discharged will not be questioned regarding their experience. The patients that have been discharged sooner may have a different perception of their hospital stay. In answer \"C,\" the researcher contributes to recall bias by pressuring mothers of autistic children, but not the nonautistic. Mothers of children with mental or physical disabilities are more likely to reflect more heavily on their exposures and activities during pregnancy. In answer \"D,\" the scale produces a differential bias by pushing the observed value in one direction away from the true value.",

The strength of evidence to accept or reject the null hypothesis is calculated as the p-value.

A small p-value means that the association found in the sample is unlikely to be due to chance. Furthermore, the null and alternative hypothesis are differentiated by an artificial cut point, known as the significance level. If the p-value is less than the significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.

All of the above are considerations to make when creating screening recommendations Implementation of a properly conducted screening test is a complex effort. Prior to initiating a screening test, the test itself must be fully scrutinized. Factors that should be evaluated include ethical consequences, psychological consequences, stigmatization, predictive value of results, test validity (and reliability once validity is established), treatment options, economics, and the risk of false-positives or falsenegatives. It is also important to figure out how to properly notify the public about the availability of the screening test so that only those in the target population come forward for screening. After results are available, it must be determined how to appropriately disseminate the results. Ethical and psychological considerations when considering a screening test come in a variety of forms, depending on the test being deliberated. Consider for example, a test that has no available treatment. What type of mental anguish would it cause for someone to know that they have an ailment that cannot be reversed? On the other hand, what if one sibling tests positive for a genetic trait that leads to cancer in everyone that has that trait. Is it ethical to perform a genetic test on one sibling, while the other would rather not have the test performed? Often times there is no correct answer in bioethics. However, it is important to consider the main bioethics principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice.",

If a 17-year-old and 20-yearold die, the total YPLL would be 113. This is calculated as follows: When there are more than 20 people in consideration, it is easier to calculate YPLL through frequency tables. It is calculated by dividing ages into the following groups: Under 1 year, 1\u00c014 years, 15\u00c024 years, 25\u00c034 years, 45\u00c054 years, 55\u00c064 years, and 65\u00c074 years. Each age group is then identified by the midpoint. That midpoint is then subtracted from the endpoint (usually 75). The difference between the midpoint and endpoint is then multiplied by each person that falls within the group. For example, if a 17-year-old and 20-year-old were to die in a motor vehicle accident, this would tally into the 15\u00c024 group. The midpoint of this group is 19.5, which is subtracted from 75 to get 55.5. Finally, this number is multiplied by two, because there are two people in this age group being calculated.

A case-control study where exposed subjects are misclassified as unexposed and a similar number of unexposed are classified as exposed Differential and nondifferential error are classified as the two types of misclassification bias. Nondifferential misclassification occurs when the frequency of errors are the same in both populations being compared. This coincides with option A, where both the exposed and unexposed subjects are misclassified. Nondifferential error typically reduces the effect of the association and brings the measured association back to the null. An example of nondifferential bias would be analysis of incomplete medical records.

The insecticide used in each county was different and the state health department would like to know if there is a difference in efficacy between the different insecticides. Because the three counties have different demographics and different amounts of outdoor attractions, the epidemiologist would like to control for confounding variables. Which test would be best to test whether or not one insecticide reduces mosquito-borne illness more than others, while controlling for confounding from demographics and differing risk of exposure (using outdoor attractions as a surrogate)? A. ANOVA B. ANCOVA C. Chi-squared D. Kappa E. t-Test 58. What do each of the following three epidemiologic tools have in Each demonstrates secular patterns B.

The drug has little margin for safetyThe ED 50 represents the smallest dose that is effective in 50% of the test population. Meanwhile, the LD 50 represents the dose that is lethal in 50% of the test population. If the ED 50 and the LD 50 are close together, the same dose (volume of drug) that produces a beneficial effect in half of the population will also cause death in half of the population. Contrarily, if the ED 50 and LD 50 are far apart, the drug has more room for error. The LD 50 is a poor indicator of health effects because death is one of the most undesirable outcomes of toxicity. Depending on the situation, a more preferable measurement is the TD 50 , the dose at which the drug is toxic to 50% of the population. As with the LD 50 , comparing the TD 50 to the ED 50 can yield important safety information.Other important acronyms to know are NOAEL and LOAEL. NOAEL stands for \"no observed adverse effect level,\" while LOAEL stands for \"lowest observed adverse effect level.\"",
