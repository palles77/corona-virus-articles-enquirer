Most of these health events were linked to animal diseases or originated in animal products, including Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, West Nile Virus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Due to the extensive involvement of animals and their products in these events, animal health authorities have been involved in measures to minimize the spread and impact of these diseases. However, it has been the public health sector, particularly within central government or international agencies, that led the effort to control or eradicate these diseases. Nevertheless, the prevention effort requires major involvement of animal health officers and others in related industries since the roots of most of these diseases are found in animal populations, particularly food-producing animals and wildlife species.",

Indonesia, Egypt, Nigeria, Turkey, and Vietnam were each identified as either a priority country where AI was spreading rapidly or a country at risk for infection. In each of these countries, a training program on epidemiological concepts, field investigation methodology, and detection of H5N1 Asia strain cases was conducted. This report includes the impact of these training sessions on national animal health programs, including follow-up activities of animal health officers who went through these training sessions.",

It has therefore become obvious that the health status of animals and their products plays a major role in import and export regulations. This type of requirement for trade has placed pressure on the animal health program both nationally and internationally. Veterinary professionals throughout the world, mainly through their animal health services, are faced with having to fulfill a crucial role in protecting their country's animal health status, providing sound surveillance information on the occurrence of diseases within their territories, and conducting scientifically valid risk analyses to establish justified import requirements. The majority of these tasks and activities require sound epidemiological approaches. Veterinary epidemiology as a discipline has therefore become the main focus of the scientific community for effectively combating infectious animal diseases nationally and internationally. This paper presents the value and role of veterinary epidemiology in combating infectious animal diseases on a global scale, emphasizing the importance of training and outreach programs.

Modern veterinary epidemiology was established in response to demands by veterinary and public health professionals to aid them in handling health events, including suboptimal production, within highly intensive livestock operations. In the 1960s and 1970s, quantitative veterinary epidemiology was attractive to intensive livestock producers, practitioners and, to a certain extent, central and local governments (Schwabe et al., 1977) . The term ''herd health'' was used interchangeably with modern veterinary epidemiology. The tools and techniques were mainly borrowed and modified from several other disciplines such as clinical medicine, quantitative sociology, statistics, pathology, ecology, animal sciences, and microbiology, among others and the approaches were mainly applied at the individual herd or farm level. The term ''micro-veterinary epidemiology'' was used to reflect the unit of interest/study as individual animals (Schwabe, 1982; Dohoo et al., 2001; Martin et al., 1987; Meek, 1993; Schwabe, 1993) . The dairy sector pioneered this effort and was later followed by the poultry, swine and, to a certain extent, small ruminant and equine sectors. Epidemiologic techniques were also later adapted by animal shelters, laboratory animal colonies, and in the management of free-ranging wildlife species.",

Animal health programs were in the spotlight since the primary issue that would facilitate or impede the trade of animals and their products was their effect on the safety and health of humans, animals, and plants. Comprehensive surveillance, quantitative disease indices, and science-based risk analysis were a few of the new terms that emerged during this critical time. Veterinary epidemiologists, animal scientists, and agricultural economists started to apply some of the herd health tools on a larger scale within regions, zones, or countries. The term ''macro-veterinary epidemiology'' emerged as an important discipline in shaping animal health strategies and policies in several parts of the world. This term is actually not new to scientists and policy makers since economists have used it when the unit of interest is country based. Nevertheless, not all the tools and techniques used in micro-veterinary epidemiology can be applied directly to macro-veterinary epidemiology. Modifications and adjustments to some of these tools are required and these modifications have evolved out of necessity. The discipline of veterinary epidemiology so far has not addressed methods and techniques to differentiate between these two categories of its function.",

The role of animal contamination in the salmonellosis outbreak in California via sewage was not investigated until the media made the issue public. The investigators, however, identified properly the link to human sewage contamination as the source of Salmonella bacteria in this outbreak (Kinde et al., 1996) . In the majority of cases the NPHP reacts to emerging issues brought to the public attention by the media. An exception to this is the new initiative through national surveillance in which health events are monitored and analyzed for their impact on the community. Regardless, the NAHP is almost considered to be a secondary resource for managing adverse public health events instead of working side by side with NPHP.

This system would require animal health authorities and other interested parties such as the animal industries to have intensive and effective communications with decision makers and the public. The livestock industry, veterinary professionals, animal health authorities and other related sectors should attempt to build bridges with their public health counterparts by explaining the value of NAHP for the well-being of society. The form of such collaboration requires comprehensive understanding of the role of each of these sectors in building a reliable, effective, and practical NAHP. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding of the role of each of these sectors with their counterparts. Therefore, records of successful past and current accomplishments of NAHP should be collected and presented to appropriate professional societies and authorities. The broad aspect of public health and preventive measures should also be emphasized.

Understanding the concepts of veterinary epidemiology and its tools are mainly a result of research and education. The implementation of specific approaches and tools requires training and application in natural as well as field conditions. Most of the graduate programs currently available require substantial on-campus residency periods which often make it difficult for public sector veterinarians to undertake them. Therefore, it would seem appropriate to explore the possibility of establishing training programs which require short intensive periods with the focus on animal health events of contemporary importance that are of interest to the audience. Distance education and working in the field with selected 'mentor' epidemiologists can enhance this type of training. This type of approach to training has several advantages for building a sound infrastructure for animal health programs. It allows opportunities for training in a way that more fully utilizes the talents of the veterinary epidemiologists already employed by the public sector. It will build a cadre of veterinary epidemiologists who can contribute a harmonized approach to national, regional, and global animal health programs. The training program will also be a major contributor in solving the most current emerging disease since it can deal directly with that disease. In addition, the field activities associated with this training program can be part of the regular public sector activities and thus serve ongoing needs.",

The U.S. government through the Department of State, Department of Human Health Services, and Department of Agriculture has contributed to several initiatives and projects to combat this disease in both humans and animals. For example, USDA-Animal Plant Health Inspection Services-Veterinary Services has been engaged in the delivery of technical capacity to various countries. Traditionally, APHIS has supported the training of epidemiologists within the domestic service because it recognizes the value of these scientists in the development of strategies to combat diseases, to evaluate risk, and in many cases to form the basis for field veterinarians to detect, control and eradicate outbreaks of disease. To these same ends, APHIS conducted a series of four regional epidemiology workshops in 2006 and 2007 for working-level epidemiologists of national veterinary services.

This discipline, however, should not be considered as an extension of the human public health sector or human epidemiology. Veterinary epidemiology is unique in its approaches and anticipated issues to be solved. The discipline's contribution to reducing the impact of global infectious animal diseases is significant but has had limited recognition. Veterinary epidemiologists are faced with several challenging questions in determining their role at the macro-level of animal health programs. Answering these questions requires a detailed assessment of approaches for designing scientifically sound national animal health programs that include surveillance, prevention strategies, and response plans. The planning of training and outreach sessions is an essential component for the promotion and implementation of sound animal health programs.
