            "text": "There are presently two competitive theories that attempt to explain the etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). Briefly summarized, they are: 1. An infection, probably of viral type, may attack the oligodendroglia of the central nervous system; or, 2. An autoimmune process may begin with an infection of the peripheral lymphatic immune system, producing antibodies that cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to myelinoclasia. Since 1935, research has been directed toward myelin of the central nervous system and the myelin sheaths of peripheral nerve; however, dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG) have apparently not been studied. The present hypothesis states that an infectious agent (probably viral) finds privileged sanctuary in the dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG): thereafter periodically invading the spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve. Previously reported erratic spinal fluid viral titers and cultures can be explained by differences in the anatomy of the DRG in which there is a variable and limited contact of spinal fluid with sensory ganglia. Clues to this hypothesis were noted by the author during routine neurological examinations of patients with MS, in which sensory signs and symptoms were frequently encountered. This clinical observation has also been reported by others who found such symptoms in 75% of MS patients, ranking second only to incoordination.",

Its incidence in the United States is approximately 60/100 000 in the Northeast, increasing northward into Nova Scotia, and then climbing even further to a remarkable 150/100 000 in the Shetland and Orkney Isles off northern Scotland. This unexplained latitudinal phenomenon was first described by Kurtzke (1) who reported that the disease occurred twice as often above and below 37'parallels as between them. He and numerous other researchers hypothesized that an Date received 10 September 1992 Date accepted 29 September 1992 infection is responsible, probably a virus or viruses, endemic to temporate regions, affecting large numbers of individuals before puberty. In addition, several clusters of patients were reported from certain low frequency geographic areas; apparently strengthening the infectious theory. But in a recent review, Poser (2) reviewed the above postulates, and concluded that Kurtzke's (1) theory was flawed, stating that strong genetic traits of susceptible populations (inherited from ancient Viking explorers) were underestimated, and that infections as well as vaccinations 278 early in life could be the inciting events of the 'MS trait'. Added to ongoing scientific disagreements concerning latitude and genetics, two older more all-inclusive theories that began in 1935 will be reviewed: the autoimmune versus the infectious.",

Sensory symptoms herald the first attack in more than 30% of patients, and another 30% will develop pain during the illness (11). Moulin, Foley, and Ebers (14) found that 55% of MS patients developed pain that was classified as stereotyped paroxysmal pain in 24%, and acute paroxysmal pain (such as trigmeminal neuralgia) in 9%. Recently, Stenager et al (16) reported acute and chronic pain in 117 patients with MS, in whom 23% had pain at onset. Radicular pain was the first sign of MS in 11 patients studied by Ramirez-Lassepas et al (17) , in which only 2 of 5 magnetic resonance imaging studies (MRI) revealed plaques in pain pathways. Bilateral tic douloureux in young women is a recognised symptom of MS, and may be the only pathognomonic sign of MS. Proven sites of these high intensity jabs of pain are unknown, though lesions of root entry zone and descending sensory pathway of cranial nerve V are mentioned in most articles as etiology. However, white matter lesions of the pons or medulla are rarely demonstrated in patients with tic-like pain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or at autopsy, strenthening the possibility that the pathology of trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia in MS may lie in certain cranial ganglia.",

These are formed during fetal develop ment, partly from cellular migrations of neuroblasts from the neural crest adjacent to the neural groove, and partly from primitive ectoderm. Dorsal root ganglia migrate into the spinal foramina, where peripheral nerve begins.

This is because of lateral extensions of some root sleeves, because of subarachnoid pathways in Meckel's cave, and because of Tarlov cysts in the sacral segments (20, 21) .

Shortly after EAE was described, a second historical discovery was made in which it was found that slow viruses can lie latent with incubation periods of more than 10 years. The fust such infection described was scrapie, identified in 1936 by veterinarians Cuille and Chelle by transmission to sheep: conlirmed in 1960 by transmission to other species (27) . Between 1965-1971, the following human slow viruses and proteinaceous infectious particles (PRIONS) were identified: subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, progressive rubella encephalitis, persistent immunodeficiency infection, kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Gerstmann-Strauller-Scheinker disease (27, 28) . Discoveries of EAE and slow virus identification followed so closely upon one another that it seemed that the enigma of MS would soon be solved, but the predictions were too sanguine.",

Viruses that can infect lymphoid cells in human autoimmune diseases are: inlluenza, measles, mumps, rubella, vaccinia, and varicella (29, 30) . Today's two controversial theories have both included measles and rabies as important concepts in explaining each proposition (see below). Measles is particularly interesting to researchers as the putative inciting event, because its antibody levels were elevated in MS in 31 of 35 surveys (10, 31). Johnson et al (29) and Gendelman et al (30) (using measles only as a paradigm), concluded that measles encephalomyelitis is probably secondary to an infection of the somatic lymphatic immune system with secondary autoimmune damage to myelin, citing evidence that spinal fluid cultures in measles encephalomyelitis were negative, and spinal fluid anti-measles antibodies were erratic. Further proof of autoimmune mechanisms were positive lymphoproliferative responses to myelin basic protein in patients with several types of viral encephalomyelitis, particularly measles, as well in rabies postvacinnal reactions.",

They described the neuropathology of a boy (case 18) who died after being bitten by a dog. On the 14th day of vaccination, he showed complex neurological signs thought to be postvaccinal disease. At autopsy, acute rabies was diagnosed serologically, by culture, and from the presence of Negri bodies: along with extensive perivenous demyelination. Nelson and Berry (44) reported a woman who had been bitten on her thumb by a bat, given proper postexposure prophylaxis and also misdiagnosed as postvaccinal encephalomyelitis; however, her autopsy revealed advanced demyelination in the cervical spinal cord, where rabies apparently invaded through her cervical sensory roots.",

            "text": "There are actually close interrelations between the infectious and the autoimmune theories: however, in both, an infection is thought to be the primary event. An initial infection of oligodendroglial cells may be primary, accompanied by immune-related events in adjacent cells that produce vasculomyelinopathy by the invasion of virus into the endotbelial cells of vessels of the central nervous system. Poser's (6) recent review of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis SSPE clearly described that mechanism, but he did not relate it to MS etiology. Equally plausible is the proposition that demyelination can be produced by viral specific amino acid antigenic sequences (epitopes) that unite directly with homologous target decapep tides in myelin of brain, cord, and peripheral nerve (without an infection of the lymphatic immune system), proposed by Jahnke, Fischer, and Alvord (5). Thus, neuroscientists have promulgated three separate theories in which infection inside the neuraxis is the primary event: 1. Direct infection of oligodendroglia, 2. Viral epitopes that attack formed myelin, and 3. Vasculomyelinopathy from viral antigen in endothelium. The DRG hypothesis maintains that viruses might migrate in and out central and peripheral nervous systems from strategically placed safe haven reservoirs in the cranial sensory and dorsal root ganglia.",
