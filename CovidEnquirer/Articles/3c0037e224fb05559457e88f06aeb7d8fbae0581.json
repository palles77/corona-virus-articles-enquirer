We will concentrate mainly on the mouse and use descriptive morphology as a platform for considering both the molecular mechanisms underpinning kidney morphogenesis and differentiation and the ways in which these processes can go awry and lead to congenital kidney 245 disorders, particularly in humans. As will soon become apparent, however, it is not possible to consider any one of these aspects in isolation: Such has been the speed of progress over the past decade that the study of congenital kidney disease and the search for key genes that regulate nephrogenesis are as the two wheels of a bicycle. Moreover, the study of the molecular biology of the developing ludney is illuminating aspects of developmental morphology that have received very little attention in the past. Indeed, kidney development is turning out to be much more complicated than was suspected even 5 years ago, and we are nowhere near the position where the basic molecular mechanisms controlling kidney development are even approximately understood. This survey thus is to be seen as the view of the traveller.",

The mouse metanephros starts to form just before embryonic day 11 when, on each side of the embryo, an epithelial tube called the ureteric bud grows from the nephric duct and extends some 200-300 p n into a small dense mass of about 5000 cells, called the metanephrogenic mesenchyme, which is located within the intermediate mesoderm at about the level of the middle of the hindlimb. A few hours after the bud invades the metanephrogenic mesenchyme, a reciprocal interaction takes place with two main results. First, the bud starts to bifurcate, eventually forming the collecting-duct system that will drain through the nephric duct into the bladder. Second, the metanephrogenic mesenchyme starts to differentiate, first into stem cells (El I S ) , which are seen at the kidney periphery, and later into their descendants, the nephrons of the cortex (>E13) and the mature stroma of the medulla (Fig. 1 ). At about this time, the neural and vascular components of the kidney start to differentiate.",

The more obvious of these are the following: budding of the nephric duct and its directed extension into the metanephrogenic mesenchyme; reciprocal inductions between the bud and the metanephrogenic mesenchyme; branching morphogenesis; control of stem-cell growth and differentiation; formation of mesenchymal condensations; mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition; epithelial morphogenesis and fusion; and patterning of the filtration capabilities Fig. 1 The development of the mouse kidney. At E10.25 or so, the ureteric bud forms off the Wolffian duct and extends towards the uninduced mesenchyme of the metanephric blastema, reaching it some 12 h later. Over the next day, the bud invades the mesenchyme and starts to bifurcate while the mesenchyme is induced, with some of it condensing around the tips of the duct. A day later (E12.5). small dense (black) condensations form that will become nephrons. Over the next day, and as the bud continues to bifurcate to produce the collecting-duct system, a profound change takes pace in the mesenchyme lineage. Here, existing condensations epithelialize (white) as new condensations (black) continue to form from the dense mesenchyme. This is now at the periphery of the rudiment where it acts as a population of stem cells, while the less dense mesenchyme has moved toward the center of the rudiment where it will form stromal cells. By E16, the epithelialized nephrons have fused to the collecting-duct system. (Drawings are not to scale and were produced by Amy Carless.) along the length of the nephron. Thus, there are direct analogies between the kidney and many other tissues, and aficionados of embryogenesis will realize that this list covers all major developmental mechanisms. As will become clear later, kidney formation also requires most of the minor ones too! One reason for studying the kidney is the belief that solving problems in this tissue will be easier than in other organs and, hence, that work on the kidney has 8. The Development of the Kidney 249 a greater significance than it might appear at first sight (We are aware that the same claim has been made for many other tissues but tend to find such claims unconvincing, as will be discussed). Another is that some important congenital kidney disorders in humans can be approached through mouse models (the best known being Wilms' tumor, in which growth and differentiation of the stem cells go awry); indeed, such disorders and others that can be manufactured through transgenic technology (Table I) are providing valuable keys to understanding normal kidney development (see later discussion).",

This would then be followed by a section showing how they go awry in congenital kidney disorders. Such a review is, unfortunately a decade or two into the future. Instead, this review proper starts with a slightly more detailed description of the various stages of normal kidney differentiation (Section ILA), which is followed by a summary of the roles played by growth and death (Section 1I.B) and a discussion of the extent to which kidney cell lines will emulate normal developmental processes in virro (Section 1I.C). The following section covers kidney disorders, either natural [Wilms' tumor (Section 1II.A) and polycystic kidney disorders (Section IILB)] or induced through homologous recombination in transgenic mice. In a sense, these sections pose the detailed questions currently being investigated. The next and longest section considers the progress that has been made toward finding these answers, particularly with respect to competence in the metanephrogenic mesenchyme (Section IV.A), lineage relationships for the various cell types in the kidney (Section IV.B), ureteric bud induction and branching morphogenesis (Section IV.C), and mesenchyme induction (Section 1V.D) and its downstream effects (Section 1V.E). Accompanying these sections are tables that detail some of the core data about kidney development. It will soon become apparent that none of the obvious problems of kidney development as yet has a completely satisfactory solution.

It is, however, worth mentioning for two reasons. First, the observations on the BFK-/-mouse (Hatini et 253 al., 1996) , which are discussed later, have forced us to revise the role of the medullary cells in mediating nephrogenesis, and, second, several hundred neurons together with a renal ganglion differentiate within this stroma, even in v i m (Karavanov et al., 1995) .",

There is, of course, no sharp border between these second and third phases because mature nephrons located at the corticomedullary border can be functional while the more peripheral nephrons are still differentiating. Nevertheless, on the basis of the morphology and emergence of differentiation markers in the nephrons and the behavior of the embryo, it seems as if the metanephros starts to function at around El6 when the mature nephron structures start to form and their loops of Henle descend into the medulla. Indeed, it is at about this time that the collecting-duct system starts to expand at its base and form calyces, the enlarged lumens into which urine flows on its way to the ureter.",

Although exact counts have not been made, two independent lines of analysis suggest that there are 1000-2000 nephrons in the mature mouse kidney. On the basis of relative size, the mature mouse kidney (-8 mm across) has about 0.1 % of the volume of a human kidney (-10 cm across) with its 1.5 million nephrons (Fawcett and Raviola, 1994) and so should have -1000 nephrons. Absolute size calculations give a similar figure: In the mouse kidney, each nephron is about 4 mm in length and about 100 Frn in diameter apart from its larger, spherical glomerulus. If we assume that 50% of the kidney's volume is composed of nephrons, then there is space for about 2000 nephrons with each being composed of several thousand cells. This is an impressive figure for it means that, as the initial mesenchymal blastema itself had several thousand cells, each on average probably gave rise to one or two nephrons.",

However, things are not quite that simple. The growth of the kidney in culture is actually rather slow, and even after 4 days in the presence of serum it has only doubled in size twice (Bard and Ross, 1991) . After that, there seems to be further differentiation, but no more growth.

Loss of BMP-7 has no effect on early nephrogenesis, but, in its absence, growth soon slows and the mice are born with small kidneys and few nephrons (Dudley et al., 1995) , a result suggesting that BMP-7, which is synthesized by the cells of the collecting duct, is needed for the growth of the stem cells. This view is confirmed by the observations of Vukicevic et al. (1996) , who showed that the addition of BMP-7 to isolated but induced metanephric mesenchyme in vitro enabled the cells to divide and differentiate. The second knockout is that of BF-2, a transcription factor expressed in the stromal cells of the medulla (Hatini et al., 1996) . In the BF-2-/-mouse, however, it is the cortical cells that fail to grow or form proper nephrogenic aggregates (discussed earlier). It is thus clear that BF-2 controls the production, by the stroma, of factors that regulate growth and differentiation of the metanephrogenic mesenchyme. As the only growth factor known to be produced by the stroma is TGFP, and as its knockout has no effect on kidney development (Boivin et al., 1995) , it seems as if there are additional growth factors regulating growth and development and synthesized within the stroma that are still to be discovered.",

If the three-dimensional matrix is an \"inert\" substrate such as agar, then the apicobasal polarity of the cells is opposite that in a normal hdney tubule-their basal surfaces are innermost and their apical ones outmost (like an early mammalian embryo). If, on the other hand, they are cultured in a matrix containing, for example, collagen, their polarity reverses so that they form the basal-out, apical-in structure typical of real kidney tubules (Wang et al., 1994) .

This animal carries a temperature-sensitive allele of SV40 large T antigen under the control of a y-interferon-inducible promoter. At 37\u00b0C and in the absence of y-interferon, the antigen is inactive and the animal's cells are normal. If the cells are taken from an animal of this strain and cultured at 33\u00b0C with y-interferon, the T antigen becomes active and forces the cells to multiply-at least in theory. Subsequent transfer to the nonpennissive tempera- ture will cause the cells, now far greater in number, to return to their previous behavior (again, in theory). Use of temperature-sensitive SV40 large T alleles has been effective with several types of cell, for example, neurons (Giordarno et al., 1993, 1996) and myocytes (Miller et al., 1994; Benito et al., 1993) , but so far has failed to yield a nephrogenic cell line. It has, however, been useful with already epithelial renal cell lines (Piedagnel et al., 1994; Hosoyamaad et al., 1996) .

(1996) , whose elegant technique combines the use of SV40 Tts-58 transgenic cells with exploitation of two-phase induction. Barasch er al. have created a cell line from the ureteric buds of SV40 Tts-A58 transgenic mice and have shown that conditioned medium from this line switches wild-type metanephrogenic mesenchyme cells into vigorous growth without compromising their ability to be later induced into nephrogenesis. The technique may enable researchers to transfect nephrogenic cells in the near future and so provide them with a key tool for investigating the molecular basis of nephrogenesis.",

Like most cancers, it presents with a somewhat variable histology, but \"classical\" (triphasic) Wilms' tumors show large numbers of proliferative blastemal cells, in which small islands of epitheliogenic and stromogenic differentiation are scattered that parody normal kidney development. The blastemal cells do not express Pax-2 (Dressler and Douglas, 1992) and therefore are unlike normal nephrogenic stem cells (see Section 11). Genetic study of Wilms' tumor family trees has resulted in the identification of a tumor-suppressor gene called WTl, which maps to the 1 lp13 region of chromosome 11 [for a review, see Coppes and Williams (1994) l. WT1 is mutated in approximately 15% of tumors; the etiology of the remaining 85% remains mysterious, although there is one other site, closely linked to the fGFf1 gene on chromosome 11 in the 1 lp15 region, in the region of the Beckwith-Wiedemann locus that may account for some of them. A third gene is likely to be on chromosome 16 [for a review, see Tay (1995) ; Ward, 19971 . The role of WTl and its possible role in Wilms' tumor are discussed later.",

The natural inducing molecule might be GDNF, which is expressed by uninduced metanephrogenic mesenchyme (Trupp et al., 1995) , but the observation that not all GDNF-I-mice show complete absence of ureteric buds (Moore et al., 1996) argues that there is some redundancy with other, so far unidentified, factors.",

In this context, it is intriguing that a search for WTI homologues across the vertebrates showed that the gene was present in chick, alligator, frog, and zebrafish as well as in mouse and humans (Kent et al., 1995) , with both the zinc fingers and the transregulatory domain exhibiting a high level of similarity.

Although little is understood about the reasons for the WTl expression pattern, Hofmann et al. (1993) have shown that its upstream region contains at least four start sites and a range of other intriguing features, the most important of which may be that the WT1 promoter region contains potential recognition sites for WTl/EGR, Pax-8, and GAGA-like transcription factors. The first of these points to a possible autoregulatory stimulation or inhibition of WTl expression (Rupprecht el al., 1994) and the second to a way in which WTl is up-regulated in the podocyte layer soon after Pax-8 starts to be expressed; this view is strengthened by the fact that transfected Pax-8 isoforms can stimulate WT1 expression in cells (Dehbi and Pelletier, 1996; Pelletier, 1996b) . A similar and earlier role also seems to be taken by Pax-2, which is expressed by MM very soon after induction (see the following), and this activity may account for the initial up-regulation of WTl in the induced MM and early condensates (Dehbi et al., 1996; Pelletier, 1996a) .",

Nonetheless, details of who gives rise to whom and in what order choices between developmental pathways are made remains, for the most part, uncertain. The classic story is that the ureteric bud develops into collecting duct and that metanephrogenic mesenchyme forms stroma and nephrons, but this is clearly inadequate as it provides no source for neurons (which grow in culture as well as in vivo) blood cells, and the juxtaglomerular apparatus.",

By using the techniques of retroviral cell marking and diI cell labeling, these researchers observed that the progeny of labeled ureteric bud cells could later be found in nephric epithelium. On this basis, they claimed that the cells of a labeled bud can leave it, undergo an epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition, and join the nephrogenic mesenchyme cells, where they then undergo a reverse mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition to become part of the nephrons. 8 .

The first of these is hepatocyte growth factor-scatter factor (HGF/SF), which is produced by the mesenchymal stem cells of developing kidneys (Sonnenberg et Woolf et al., 1995) ; its c-MET high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinase is expressed by the epithelium of the ureteric bud-developing collecting duct (Sonnenberg et al., 1993; Woolf er a/., 1995) . The HGF/SFc-MET system was therefore an obvious candidate paracrine regulator, and its physiological function was tested by the addition of function-blocking antibodies to kidney rudiments growing in v i m ; the antibodies strongly inhibited collectingduct development (Woolf er al., 1995) . This result provided such firm evidence for HGF/SF having an essential paracrine r6le that the result of an HGF-/- (Schmidt et al., 1995; Uehara et al., 1995) . This paradox has yet to be resolved. A morphogenetic function for the signaling system based on a second growth factor, GDNF, and its high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinase, c-RET, is supported by both culture and transgenic knockout data. GDNF is synthesized by uninduced metanephrogenic mesenchyme and nephrogenic stem cells, whereas c-RET is expressed by the epithelium of Wolffian duct and ureteric bud. Transgenic knockout mice of the GDNF-/ -and c-RET-/ -types show marked inhibition of ureteric bud-collecting-duct development, although both show some variation in phenotype severity from mouse to mouse. Treatment of kidneys growing in virro with beads soaked in high concentrations of GDNF causes an increase in collecting-duct branching in the vicinity of the beads, whereas the growth factor maintains the morphology of isolated ureteric buds in hanging-drop culture (Sainio et al., 1997) .",

            "text": "A slightly different approach to understanding duct morphogenesis has been the use of purified growth factors to \"rescue\" growth-inhibited kidney rudiments in culture. Many growth factors bind to sulfated glycosaminoglycan (S-GAG) coreceptors on the surface of cells that serve to concentrate these factors (and thus increase their chances of binding neighboring high-affinity receptors) and may facilitate binding to the high-affinity receptors by inducing conformational change (Rapraeger et al., 1991; Lyon et al., 1994) . The depletion of cultured kidney rudiments of their S-GAGS results in complete and reversible inhibition of collecting-duct growth and branching [ Fig. 6a of l. This inhibition can be relieved by simultaneous treatment with concentrations of certain growth factors at concentrations high enough to compensate for the lack of S-GAGS. Under these conditions, HGF/SF restores growth to the developing collecting-duct system without activating branching morphogenesis, so that the epithelium develops into an abnormally long unbranched tube [ Fig. 6b (1995) ], so well indeed that it can even induce branching from the \"wrong\" end of the ureteric bid (Sainio et al., 1997) . The implication of these results, that the growth and branching aspects of arborization seem to be controlled separately, may have important implications for the development of (c) and (d) because they are stained for a collecting-ductspecific marker). Treatment of the S-GAG-depleted kidneys with exogenous HGF causes their collecting ducts to extend but not to branch (b), while treatment with GDNF causes branching and swelling of the ducts without much extension (d-compare with the control culture (c)). glandular organs in general. Each has a characteristic epithelial shape primarily governed by the surrounding stroma, so that, for example, salivary gland epithelium placed in lung stroma develops in the approximate shape of lung epithelium (Deucher, 1975) . Different ratios of mitogenic and branch-generating signals might provide a simple explanation for the characteristic anatomies of glandular epithelia and the different degrees to which they fill three-dimensional space (their fractal dimensions).",

The situation may not, however, be that simple, and two pieces of evidence, both obtained from culture work, suggest that internodal branching might also exist. A general property of trees that develop by terminal branching, first noticed by Leonard0 da Vinci [see Long, (1994) for a review], is that the ratio of the diameter of a branch of generation n to that of a branch of generation (n + 1) is a constant (da Vinci's number). This means that the ratio of the diameter of the trunk to that of the first main branches is the same as that of the first main branches to that of the secondary branches, and so on; in modern parlance, the tree shows self-similarity (fractal geometry). The arborization of many botanical trees, and also that of zoological \"trees\" such as canine airway epithelium, follows this general pattern (Nelson et al., 1990) . Attempts to calculate the da Vinci number (or the related fractal dimension) of the collecting ducts of kidneys developing in culture do not, however, work if one measures the branch generation number (primary, secondary, tertiary, etc.) by assuming that only terminal branching takes place. One can obtain a constant da Vinci number only by assuming that the internodes of branches of generation n can directly give rise to branches of generations >(n + 1) (J. A. Davies, unpublished) .",

One obvious potential mechanism for mediating this deformity of cell shape is cytoskeletal tension generated by actin and myosin; another is pressure of growth. Actin microfilaments are indeed concentrated at the sites of maximum cell deformation (J. A. Davies, unpublished, Fig. 7 ), but there is as yet no unambiguous evidence that the actin-myosin interaction is the main agent for branch initiation. Drugs such as cytochalasin D, which interfere with microfilament polymerization, do block branch initiation very effectively (B. Harron, L. Ramage, and J. A. Davies, unpublished) , but far too many cellular processes are likely to be affected by this treatment to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. Phalloidin staining of developing nephrons reveals a high concentration of filamentous actin bending of the tubule is taking place, as predicted from a model in which localized ''purse-' contraction of apical microfilament networks drives bending morphogenesis.",

The evidence for this view came from transfilter experiments in which the mesenchyme was separated from the inducing tissue by a polycarbonate filter of sharply defined pore size. Generally, the inducing tissue used was spinal cord rather than ureteric bud, because embryonic spinal cord is a much stronger inducer (Grobstein, 1955) . When the filter pores were large enough to allow penetration by cell processes, transfilter induction took place (Fig. S) , but if the filter pores were too small to allow penetration by cell processes, then induction failed (SaxCn et al., 1976; SaxCn, 1980) . The obvious conclusion was either that the inducer was tightly bound to the cell surface, so that it could not diffuse away and act at a distance, or that a combination of its half-life in free solution and the concentration required for it to act limited the range of an effective concentration to a distance so small as to be indistinguishable from contact. Electron microscopy confirmed that contact takes place in the large-pore transfilter system and demonstrated that there were no morphological specializations at the sites of intercellular contact. Fig. 8 Two commonly used methods of inducing nephron development in culture. In the top panel, a complete E10.5 murine kidney rudiment has been cultured on a filter at the gas-medium interface; its collecting duct system has branched and induced nephrons to form from the surrounding strorna. In the bottom panel, isolated metanephrogenic mesenchyme has been cultured on a filter underneath which is embryonic spinal cord: the spinal cord has induced the formation of many nephrons in the mesenchyme.",

This agar(ose) was regarded as a neutral \"glue.\" However, it has become clear that many growth factors (e.g., FGF-2 and HGF) bind to sulfated glycans (particularly heparin sulfate). If the inducing molecule were to bind to the sulfated glycans present in agar, then the blob of glue may in fact have sequestered a diffusible inducing molecule before it was able to pass beyond the glue and through the filter pores. To explore this possibility, the classical transfilter experiments have been repeated but instead using a sandwich of filters instead of agar to hold the inducing tissue (again spinal cord) in some cultures. In the absence of agar, induction took place even across multiple layers of filters with pore sizes too small to admit cell processes; exclusion of these processes was confirmed by SEM (Davies and Bard, unpublished) . These data lead to the view that the inducing molecules from spinal cord are capable of acting tens of cell diameters from their source. Unfortunately, transfilter induction by normal ureteric bud cannot be obtained even with large-pore filters, so that we still know nothing about the diffusibility or otherwise of signals from the natural inducer of nephrogenesis. However, induction of at least the first stages of development (see Section IV.D.2 for a discussion of multistage induction) can be performed by conditioned medium from a ureteric-bud-derived cell line, strongly suggesting that ureteric bud, too, induces at least some stages of the process by diffusible means (Barasch et al., 1996) .",

Perantoni et al. (1995) have identified the critical component of a cell extract that can induce nephrogenesis in the rat as FGF-2 and have gone on to show that very high concentrations of purified FGF-2 can induce nephrogenesis in isolated rat metanephrogenic mesenchyme in culture, albeit unusually slowly. In its favor, FGF-2 is present in the ureteric bud throughout the period of induction (Dono and Zeller, 1994) , and it is present in the artificial inducers of nephrogenesis such as spinal cord. However, several facts argue against FGF-2 being the natural inducer. First, FGF-2 fails to induce mouse nephrogenic mesenchyme: this implies either that rats and mice induce kidney development very differently, which would be very surprising, or that FGF-2 by chance happens to mimic the natural inducer in rats, but itself is not that inducer. Second, FGF-2 is produced by tissues that are not inducers of nephrogenesis, including nephrons themselves. Third, treatments that would be expected (from other systems) to inhibit FGF-2 action do not inhibit nephrogenesis, at least in mouse. For example, the removal of cellular sulfated 8. The Development of the Kidney (Farley ef al., 1978; Rapraeger er al., 1991) ] OT by heparitinase enzymes is known to inhibit the effects of FGF-2 in cell lines. These treatments do not, however, prevent nephrogenesis in vitro . Treatment of kidney rudiments developing in vitro with function-blocking anti-FGF-2 also fails to block nephrogenesis (J. A. Davies, unpublished) . Another growth factor, BMP-7, is a second candidate for an inducing molecule. BMP-7 appears to meet the three criteria mentioned earlier. It is produced in the ureteric bud at the right time, it induces isolated rat mesenchyme (no mouse data are available), antibodies to BMP-7 block nephrogenesis, and transgenic BMP-7-/-mice show a severe shortage of nephrons (Fig. 9e, f) . These data, therefore, make it a very strong candidate for being the inducer. However, BMP-7 is also produced by developing nephrons themselves. In mouse, developing nephrons are known not to possess inducing activity (Saxtn and Saksela, 1971) , a fact that is difficult to reconcile with BMP-7 being the inducing molecule. An alternative explanation for the role of BMP-7, and one equally compatible with the data, is that BMP-7 is necessary for the subsequent nephrogenic development of cells induced by another molecule or for the maintenance of the stem-cell population.",

The primary biological effect of lithium ions is known to be inhibition of the enzyme, glycogen synthase kinase 3p (GSK-3@, the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila gene shaggy/zestewhite 3; Klein and Melton, 1996) . GSK-3P lies downstream of a Wnt signaling pathway, and binding of Wnt proteins to their receptors indirectly results in the inhibition of GSK-3P. Li+-mediated inhibition of GSK-3P therefore can be viewed as a means of mimicking Wnt-mediated signaling (though it might of course have other effects too). It therefore provides more circumstantial evidence in favor of Wnt proteins. Against the Wnt story, however, is the difficulty in reconciling it with the transfilter data described earlier that suggest that the inducer is a diffusible agent that binds to charged carbohydrate.",

Following spinal cord induction, for example, there is a bout of DNA synthesis after some 8 hr of contact with an inducer, whereas the first signs of nephrogenesis can only be seen at 18 hr . This pattern of timing is at least compatible with the idea of a first induction to stem cells followed by a second to nephrogenesis itself. Much more significant support for the model, however, has come from the observation that conditioned medium produced by immortalized ureteric bud cells can induce metanephrogenic mesenchyme into the stem-cell state (as assessed by the cessation of apoptosis and commencement of vigorous mitosis; Barasch et al., 1996) without inducing progression into nephrogenesis itself. The second induction requires contact with the basolateral surfaces of the ureteric bud; cell-conditioned medium is not enough (Barasch et al., 1996) , although in the case of the rat, ureteric-bud-conditioned medium plus FGF-2 plus TGFa does induce nephrogenesis (Karavanova et af., 1996) . These two inductions could be mediated by different molecules. Alternatively, they could be mediated by a single molecule with threshold-dependent effects; a low concentration would effect the switch to stem cells, while a higher concentration would be required for nephrogenesis. This model would account for the fact that cells undergoing nephrogenesis are located close to the developing collecting-duct system whereas cells farther away multiply without differentiating.",

These include the transcription factors Pax-2 and Hox-C9 and the signaling molecules HGF, c-MET, and p75-NGFR. HGF and its receptor c-MET have the potential to form an autocrine loop because both are expressed in the same cells (Woolf etal., 1995) . The existence of such a loop is supported by the effect of adding antibodies that interfere with the HGFc-MET interaction, which results in markedly increased apoptosis in what should be the stem-cell population. The antibodies also block subsequent differentiation, although it is not clear whether this results from a failure of earlier proliferation. There must be some redundancy in vivo, however, as HGF knockout mice have normal kidneys. Antisense inhibition of p75-NGFR synthesis in culture also blocks renal development (Sariola et al., 1991) , although once again the knockout mouse shows no renal defect (Lee et al., 1992) .",

The effect of LIF therefore might be to abolish the inducing activity of the ureteric bud. Normally, data on the distribution of the LIF receptor could be used to indicate the likelihood of this, but the only known receptor for LIF does not appear to be expressed anywhere in the developing kidney, making the effect of the chemokine even more mysterious. LIF receptor knockouts have no reported renal phenotype (Ware et al., 1995), nor do transgenic mice that lack IL6 or CNTF, both of which also bind to components of the LIF receptor (Dedera et ai., 1996; Masu et al., 1993) .

Several experiments have, however, cast doubt on this view, particularly the discovery of pharmacological means to carry out induction (see Section 1V.D). Isolated mesenchymes induced with either Li+ ions or bFGF produce a mosaic pattern of developing nephrons and surrounding stroma, despite the fact that these small molecules will have reached all of the cells in the culture. If the nephrogenic and stromogenic cells arise from lineages that were separate even at the beginning of kidney development (model 2 in section IV.B), all that needs to be explained is the sorting out of a mixed population into a mosaic pattern. This may be explained rather easily by known changes in cell adhesion molecule expression (e.g., of NCAM; Klein et al., 1984) . If, as is usually assumed, the MM consists of one cell type that gives rise to both stroma and nephrons, we must explain how the choice of fate is made, One possibility is a system of lateral inhibition mediated by signaling molecules in interacting feedback loops like that based on Notch and Delta, which divides ectodermal cells of Drusophila into neurogenic and epithelial fates (Simpson et al., 1992) . The vertebrate homologues of Notch, mouse notch1 and notch 2, are indeed expressed in the developing kidney at about the right time and place (to the resolution of published data). Transgenic knockout of notch1 results in lethality too early in development for any metanephric effects to be assessed; a system based on these molecules would involve only nearest neighbor interactions anyway and so would not be ideal for the establishment of islands of many tightly aggregated cells of similar fates. Partitioning between fates remains one of the most baffling problems of renal development.",

In cultured kidney rudiments, condensation lasts approximately 6 hr, beginning some 18 hr after first contact with an inducer . The mechanisms responsible for aggregation are not known, but work on other examples of mesenchyme condensation (see Bard, 1992) The first model is supported by the fact that adhesion molecule expression does indeed change just before aggregation begins. For example, expression of the homophilic neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM, is strongly up-regulated, as is expression of the proteoglycan, syndecan-1 (Vainio et al., 1992) . Inhibition of N-CAM function, by antibody or transgenic knockout techniques (Klein et at., 1988; Cremer et al., 1994) does not, however, prevent normal nephrogenesis. The removal of syndecan-1's sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains also fails to block nephrogenesis , although there is as yet no information about the effects of inhibiting the synthesis of the syndecan-1 protein core. These few experiments cannot, of course, rule out the adhesion molecule hypothesis for aggregation, as the cells might also express additional, undiscovered adhesive systems.

Before condensation, mesenchymal cells are separated by a prominent interstitial matrix consisting of fibronectins, collagens I and 111, and glycosaminoglycans, whereas in the condensates themselves cells are in very close apposition and all signs of interstitial collagens and fibronectins disappear (Ekblom, 198 I; Ekblom et al., 1981; Laitinen et al., 1991) . The rapid removal of these components suggest localized activity of degradative enzymes, but it is not clear that this activity is enough to account for condensation itself. In other systems, such as the condensation of somatopleure mesenchyme to form cartilage, localized loss of extracellular matrix components seems to play an important role in bringing cells closer together to form the initial condensation (Toole, 1972) , although N-CAM production can also be important here [for a review, see Hall and Miyake (1995) l. It will be interesting to determine whether there is any relationship between the formation of nephrogenic and cartilaginous condensations.",

One that has yet to be excluded is cell traction, a mechanism based on the balance of two forces: the adhesions that cells make to one another and to their environment and the contractile abilities of the cells. Harris et al. (1984) have shown that these forces can cause uniform cell culture to break up into aggregates. One reason for suggesting that tractional forces may play a role in the formation of nephrogenic condensations comes from the following simple experiment (J.B.L. Bard, unpublished) : If kidney rudiments are cultured on inert substrata, they adhere, spread, and form about 20-30 nephrons. If, however, such rudiments are cultured in hanging-drop culture where there is no substratum, no more than two or three nephrons form, even though other tissues such as salivary glands develop normally under these conditions. Such a result demonstrates the need for substratum adhesions if condensations are to form (Bard, 1990 ), but does not, of course, prove that this need is manifested through traction.",

Until this research was published there was no reason to suppose that the stromal cells had any effect on nephrogenesis, but, quite unexpectedly, the small kidneys of the BF-2-/-mouse were found to contain relatively few but very large mesenchymal aggregates that failed to form nephrons (Fig. 9c, d) . There was also an abnormally small number of branches in the collecting-duct system. The large mesenchymal condensates were up to 20 cells in diameter and expressed wnr-4, a marker of the late condensation stage (Gavin et al., 1990) . but their further differentiation seemed to be blocked.",

Before they are of any physiological use, nephrons have to be connected to a blood supply at their glomerular end (the source of urinary fluid) and the collecting duct at their distal end. The first indications of a blood supply to the glomeruli are present very early in nephron development, when capillaries appear in the glomerular cleft (Loughna et al., 1996) . Most evidence indicates an angiogenic origin for these vessels (i.e., by the sprouting of preexisting vessels), the most significant observation being a lack of capillary development in kidney rudiments removed from El 1 mice and cultured away from any external sources of endothelium (Bernstein et al., 1981) . Kidney rudiments elicit a strong outgrowth of capillaries if cultured on avian chorioallantoic membrane (Sariola et al., 1983) and express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; Landels et al., 1994) , which is known to be a major enhancer of angiogenesis in other systems (Breier et al., 1992; Millauer et al., 1992) . VEGF is expressed by the glomerular epithelium, whereas itsjlt-1 receptor is expressed by the endothelia themselves (Breier et al., 1992; Simon et al., 1995) , suggesting a paracrine loop that might also be responsible for attracting growing capillaries to the correct site (although how they generate the complex glomerular architecture is still a mystery).",

These strategies would be particularly useful in the case of cell lines derived from the kidneys of knockout mice.

Once we begin to see how signal pathways lead to new cell phenotypes, we will be able to work on the next set of such synthetic problems, those dealing with how these changes lead to new structures. Here, very little is known about any aspect of kidney morphogenesis, whether it be the localization of stem cells, formation of the bifurcations that generate the collecting-duct system, coalescence of nephrogenic cells into aggregates that undergo the mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition, or the first step in nephron formation or, indeed, any other step in their formation. These problems are not for the short term, partly because they are difficult and partly because they are unfashionable and therefore unlikely to attract much interest or financial support.",
