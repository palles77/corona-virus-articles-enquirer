They have been circulated to members of the ICNV and have received little adverse criticism; it is therefore to be expected that they will receive final official approval at the meeting to be held in Mexico City in August 1970. They have already been approved by the Executive Committee of ICNV.",

Fenner's (1968) proposed name \"Encephalovirus\" for the group is not approved. The name \"arbovirus\" is to be used in a purely biological sense to denote those viruses having a biological cycle in both arthropods and vertebrates. The arboviruses related to bluetongue and vesicular stomatitis have clearly different characters from the others and are not included in the toga-viruses. All of the provisional members are, however, biologically arboviruses or else are closely related serologically to others which are. It may prove desirable to employ separate names to designate the A, B, and other groups. The relevant study group is being asked to designate a type-species: until this is done togavirus can be used as a Irjargon name.\" It is realized that future work may reveal that fundamental characters may be shared by a number of viruses which are arthropod-borne and by others which are not (cf. Holmes & Warburton, 1967) .",
