Terrorism due to infectious agents needs a different paradigm than nuclear or chemical bioterrorism. 1 Polluting drinking water of enemies with rye ergot (a fungus) by Assyrians in 600 BC was a common strategy. In Middle Ages, Tartar forces hurled plague-infected dead bodies in enemy cities and caused epidemic. Russians repeated it in Swedish forces in 1710. British forces used blankets contaminated with smallpox viruses in native Indians and French forces in America in the 18th century AD. During World War I, the German Army developed anthrax, glanders, and cholera as bioweapons. During World War II, Japanese forces and USA developed botulinum and anthrax. The British tested anthrax bombs in 1942. In 1979, there was an accidental release of spores of anthrax in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics with at least 68 deaths. In the Persian Gulf War, Iraq stockpiled bioweapons of anthrax, botulinum, and aflatoxin. In 1984, Bhagwan Rajneesh contaminated salad bars in Oregon, USA, with Salmonella spp. to cause food poisoning. In 2001, anthrax spores were sent by postal mail to selective persons in the USA with 22 cases of cutaneous, inhalation, and meningeal anthrax and 5 deaths. 2,3",

It produces a potent exotoxin. 7 Spores can survive in the soil for years and decades. These get activated in the host in 1e6 days, but some may take up to 60 days or even more. Anthrax is common in herbivorous animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and horses. The infective dose is only 1e10 spores. Humans acquire infection through respiratory, gastrointestinal, or cutaneous route (this being the commonest, 95% in the form of a malignant pustule). Inhalation anthrax is the most severe one because it frequently causes septicemia and meningitis with high mortality and the highest risk of man-made spread. Consumption of improperly cooked meat causes gastrointestinal anthrax. Injection abscesses in drug abusers (contaminated heroin) have been reported in Europe (especially Scotland). Humans are accidental dead-end hosts in this livestock-human interface. Any unexplained sudden deaths in livestock and humans who process or consume animal products must be properly investigated to rule out anthrax. There is a need for immediate laboratory confirmation, medical care, and containments because all types can lead to septicemia and death. 8e10",

If the strain is penicillin sensitive, amoxicillin 1 g thrice a day or penicillin V 500 mg 6 hourly is advised. The duration of treatment is 60 days during terrorism or for 7e10 days otherwise. The antitoxin is added for suspected systemic disease. Human anthrax immunoglobulin (Anthrasil) or monoclonal antibody may be used. 11, 12 Meningeal disease: Three antibiotics (clindamycin must be used) combination should be used for 60 days, at least one of which is bactericidal and one protein synthesis inhibitor. 13 Preexposure prophylaxis (in laboratory workers, veterinarians, and animal handlers) should be protected with 5 intramuscular injections of vaccine over 18 months with subsequent annual boosters. 14 Postexposure prophylaxis should include 3 injections of vaccine over 4 weeks in addition to antibiotic therapy for 60 days. 15 Anthrax immunoglobulin given intravenously has been tried as passive immunization in various animals and human cases. However, a meta-analysis of 9 such studies did not show significant results. 16 It is well documented that a timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy leads to dramatic recovery. Bacillus anthracis from naturally occurring cases is invariably penicillin sensitive. It is also sensitive to aminoglycosides, macrolides, quinolones, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, imipenem, and linezolid. However, one must carry out a laboratory evaluation of all isolates. Furthermore, one must use antibiotics that can act on spores germinating within macrophages, block the synthesis of protein toxin which is the actual cause of death, and also penetrate the blood-brain barrier.",
