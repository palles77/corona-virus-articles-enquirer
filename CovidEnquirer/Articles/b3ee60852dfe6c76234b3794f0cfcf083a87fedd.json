They are a major contributing factor of disease in industrialized countries, and are responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and a direct annual financial loss of $6-7 billion in North America alone. They are an increasingly challenging health issue due to multidrug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci among others, along with an increasing number of susceptible patients. Over the last three decades, the risk of HCAIs has increased in the radiology department (RD) in part because of an increased number of patients visiting the department and an increase in the utilization of imaging modalities. In this review, we will discuss how patients and staff can be exposed to HCAIs in the RD, including contaminated inanimate surfaces, radiology equipment, and associated medical devices. As the role of medical imaging has extended from primarily diagnosis to include more interventions, the implementation and development of standardized infection minimization protocols and infection control procedures are vital in the RD, particularly in interventional radiology. With globalisation and the rapid movement of people regionally, nationally, and globally, there is greater risk of exposure to contagious diseases such as Ebola, especially if infected patients are undiagnosed when they travel. For effective infection control, advanced training and education of HCWs in the RD is essential.",

Therefore, HCWs can be considered as a vector for the transmission of HCAIs to patients [9] .Other modes of infection include contact with a contaminated surface, during transport of an infected patient, or during removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) [10] . HCWs are also potentially exposed to many bloodborne infections. As studied by Beltrami et al, the risk of transmission of bloodborne infections variably increases after percutaneous exposure. For example, the risk of transmission of hepatitis B virus is 6%-30%, hepatitis C virus is 1.8%, and human immunodeficiency virus is 0.3% [11] . Similarly, many respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis were common among HCWs, but a recent study in 2016 by Tiemersma has revealed that because of proper surveillance and use of protective equipment, the incidence of new cases of tuberculosis has declined to approximately 32% in the last 5 years (2010-2015) [12] .",

Most common among these are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, C diff, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [19] . Some of these pathogens are resistant to multiple antibiotics and antibiotic combinations, making prevention and infection control measures even more essential for the management of these HCAIs. Many resistant pathogens such as C diff inhabit the intensive care unit (ICU) environment [20] . Ventilation-associated pneumonias are also very common in ICUs leading to mortality rates of 9%-70% [21] . These factors lead to the increased cost of care because of prolonged hospitalization, intensive care admission, and treatment with newer and more complex antibiotic regimes. The incidence of HCAIs in ICU is significantly higher than for patients admitted to general inpatient wards [22] . Since imaging is often performed on multiple patients in ICU, in one general location, often with a single x-ray machine and digital cassette, heightened diligence is required to avoid the transmission of infectious agents [23] .",

Few studies have mentioned the use of robot-assisted imaging modalities in many interventional procedures including use of robotics for the ultrasound-guided venipuncture, robot-assisted MRIguided liver ablation, and ultrasound-assisted robotic prostate brachytherapy [86] [87] [88] . Similarly, wireless imaging has been utilized in few settings such as the use of wireless x-ray output analyzer system, wireless transponder tracking system for ablative radiotherapy of the liver, and use of wireless intraoral coils for dental MRI [17, 89, 90] . However, it is very crucial to investigate in detail the need to update the departmental protocols based on literature findings in the areas of these modern technologies related to the RD.",

As discussed in this review article, there are multiple resources through which HCAIs can be acquired in the RD and numerous precautionary steps are required to avoid HCAIs in the RD. However, many deficiencies are still present in terms of readiness of HCWs in the RD for epidemics and emergent infections disease outbreaks. Future studies are required in infection control practices related to IR procedures including the use of prophylactic antibiotics. In addition, further research on the use of more advance radiological technologies, such as wireless and portable imaging machines, especially in ED and during epidemics are required to reduce the risk of HCAIs in the RD. Because RDs are exposed to both direct and indirect modes of HCAIs, it is prudent to investigate further to avoid the exposure to both patients as well as HCWs.",
