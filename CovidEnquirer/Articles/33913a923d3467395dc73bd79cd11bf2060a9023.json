In this review, we examine assembly of virus capsids, focusing on hepatitis B virus and bacteriophage MS2, and formation of glycoproteins in the alphaviruses. These systems are structurally and biochemically well-characterized and are simplest-case paradigms of self-assembly. Published data suggest that capsid and glycoprotein assembly is subject to allosteric regulation, that is regulation at the level of conformational change. The hypothesis that allostery is a common theme in viruses suggests that deregulation of capsid and glycoprotein assembly by small molecule effectors will be an attractive antiviral strategy, as has been demonstrated with hepatitis B virus.",

            "text": "Is regulation of self-assembly required? The common structural denominator for a typical small virus is a genome surrounded by a shell composed of dozens of copies of the capsid protein. Many small viruses also have lipid envelopes studded with glycoproteins that can facilitate cell entry. Even a small virus is complex, yet its formation is a canonical example of self-assembly. Given the right conditions, the capsid proteins of many viruses will assemble to capsid-like structures, rapidly, in high yield and with high fidelity (Table 1 ). This observation opens up two distinct fields of study: the process of self-assembly and regulation of assembly. The process of self-assembly is best described by physical chemistry, for example self-assembly can be modeled by a system of differential equations or emulated with small molecules. Regulating assembly, by contrast, is fundamentally biochemical and ultimately biological in nature. Consider our hypothetical virus where unregulated assembly could yield capsids that did not contain the viral genome or toxic accumulation of the fusion protein. These spontaneous assembly reactions must be delayed until the right time and place. Regulation is probably at the level of allostery, which is defined as a conformational change in a molecule, usually a protein, that alters its activity, induced by an effector molecule. In addition to allostery, regulation could require viral or host factors. Regulation of the large event of virus assembly by a small reaction, such as inducing conformational change of a single protein, provides the leverage that controls virus replication in vivo. Disruption of regulation is an ideal target for antiviral therapeutics. Defining the regulation that directly controls the physical chemistry of assembly is a field in its infancy and the focus of this review.",

Both the capsid and glycoprotein are protein oligomers; from a physical-chemical perspective, their assembly is similar; from a biological perspective they demonstrably have similar elements of regulation. Although there are numerous experimental systems (Tables 1 and 2) , the discussion of capsid assembly will focus on hepatitis B virus (HBV) with significant references to retroviruses and bacteriophage MS2. Furthermore, small molecules that dramatically affect HBV assembly have demonstrable antiviral activity. The discussion on glycoprotein assembly will focus on the formation of the spike complex of alphaviruses as the spike is composed of two proteins which intricately interact and are required for viral entry. Finally, we will discuss potential steps in assembly that could be targeted for designing antiviral therapeutics.",

First, weak interactions are necessary to minimize errors and kinetic traps. Weak interactions also contribute to a defined nucleation step. Second, nucleation minimizes the initiation of assembly, decreasing kinetic trapping of intermediates due to depletion of AUs. Third, the initial kinetic phase where there is little capsid formation is due to the time required to build the steady state of intermediates that supports subsequent assembly. More sophisticated mathematical models that incorporate the biological details of individual viruses (e.g. nucleic acid, scaffolding and allostery) will help to identify opportunities to interfere with assembly.",

The earliest suggestion of allostery in retrovirus assembly came from in vitro assembly studies using DNA oligomers and Gag [22, 23] . Gag dimerization was crucial for assembly: HIV Gag would not assemble with very short oligos nor if the oligo had high-affinity sequences separated by a low-affinity sequence, suggesting that protein-protein interaction was required to activate assembly [24] . Replacing NC with a leucine zipper promoted dimerization of Gag and was sufficient to drive assembly in cells [25] , although other factors were required in vitro [26] . What transitions are driven by protein oligomerization and DNA-binding? Small angle neutron scattering indicated that HIV Gag had a propensity to fold on itself [17] , thus straightening might be a crucial assembly transition. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies have indicated that the spacer sequence C-terminal to Gag (in HIV and RSV) can refold [27, 28] . This refolding transition, driven by binding NA, might expose surfaces on CA to allow interaction [28] and generate a new, potentially helix-rich interaction between the spacer peptides [29, 30] . Recent tomographic studies of immature HIV demonstrate CA-CA interactions and spacer peptide-spacer peptide interactions [30, 31] . Thus, it appears that Gag undergoes one or more conformational transitions to assemble into an immature lattice. These conformational transitions are involved in Gag assembly and are consistent with a regulatory effect, that is they prevent assembly by obstructing interactions [28] and this obstruction can be removed by binding a cofactor [26] .",

            "text": "In the RNA bacteriophage MS2, the role of allostery mediated by NA is unambiguous ( Figure 2 ). These phages are organized with T = 3 quasi-symmetry; their capsids comprise 90 chemically identical dimers that fit into AB and CC environments [32] . B half-dimers cluster around icosahedral fivefold vertices, A and C half-dimers alternate around icosahedral threefold vertices (quasi-sixfolds). The A and C half-dimers are very similar, whereas a loop on the B subunits has a different conformation, suggesting a structural switch. Uhlenbeck and co-workers showed that a specific RNA stem-loop from the genome, TR, was necessary and by itself sufficient to induce capsid assembly [33, 34] . By NMR, TR-free dimer was shown to be symmetrical in solution, suggestive of a CC dimer, but TR-bound dimer was asymmetric [35] . Pure RNA-free dimers or pure TR-saturated dimers do not assemble rapidly, that is they appeared kinetically trapped [35] . Addition of the other form of coat protein to trapped species resulted in rapid assembly [36] . These results showed that both forms of dimer, symmetric and RNA-bound asymmetric, are needed for efficient assembly and that RNA was an allosteric effector. Non-TR RNA stem-loops also trigger these effects, although they are much weaker binders, implying that multiple RNA-coat protein interactions within the capsids also contribute to conformer switching [36, 37] . Normal mode analysis has suggested that the RNA-induced conformational change might be one of dynamics, rather than static dimer conformations [38] , and is consistent with the lack of sequence-specificity. Analyzing mixed assembly reactions by mass spectrometry has provided a clear example of assembly by one dimer at a time rather than via coalescence of oligomers [35] . Examination of assembly reactions with TR incorporated into a longer RNA have lead to the surprising conclusion that assembly might be directed by an RNA scaffold [36] , funneling the system along only a few of the very many possible assembly paths [36] . Thus, initiation by an allosteric event and limitation by allosteric responses to protein-RNA and protein-protein interaction gives MS2 assembly the appearance of following a deterministic path. An alternative viewpoint suggested by recent theoretical studies is that only a relatively small number of intermediates will ever be used during assembly as a consequence of kinetic availability and thermodynamic stability [39] . In nucleated assembly (top path), the initial association reactions are relatively slow, resulting in rare nucleation centers (brightly colored oligomer) and plenty of assembly units to allow completion of capsids. If assembly is unregulated (lower path), many partial capsids will form and very few assembly units will remain, kinetically trapping these intermediates. Of course, this trap might resolve if stochastic dissociation of some intermediates allows others to go to completion; alternatively, partial capsids can associate incorrectly, resulting in aberrant structures.",

Asymmetric free dimers (blue, PDB 3KXS) are presumably in an assembly-inactive conformation.

This hypothesis leads to predictions about the nature of assembly and its allosteric activation. First, as per assembly models, a kinetic effect will be most evident in the nucleation step. Starting capsid assembly at an inappropriate time (e.g. without the viral genetic material) is unfavorable for the virus. Second, faster kinetics indicate that effectors decrease the energy barrier to assembly, which can be best explained by invoking an effector-induced conformational change. The graphic of the HAP site in the context of free and the capsid conformations (Figure 3c ) supports this hypothesis. The key point is that only the nucleation step of an assembly reaction needs be affected to gain an overall enhancement of assembly kinetics (Figure 3d) . Thus, the few effectors needed for nucleation can be leveraged to consume many copies of Cp to produce failed virus.",

Retaining the E3 protein until the trans-Golgi might serve to prevent premature fusion of the assembled spikes with membranes in the host cell secretory pathway. Thus, E3 is an effector of spike activity. At the plasma membrane the spikes are arranged in large hexagonal arrays [64] , creating a platform for virus budding. Host proteins have not been identified within the alphavirus glycoprotein array, suggesting that lateral interactions between the spikes are important, in contrast to vesicular stomatitis virus [65] , HIV [66] and influenza virus [67] which also bud from the plasma membrane.

            "text": "Trends in Microbiology January 2011, Vol. 19, No. 1 proteases have been proposed to cleave influenza HA0 both intra-and extracellularly, and we suggest that additional proteases for other viruses will also be identified [69] . The Class III fusion proteins do not have a chaperone protein nor do they require a cleavage step to activate the protein into a fusion-active form. The vesicular stomatitis virus G protein is found in three reversible conformations in a pHdependent equilibrium. The reversible conformations are a unique property among Class III fusion proteins, suggestive of allosteric conformational changes, which also prevents premature fusion during assembly [70] . Thus, the classification of fusion proteins is dependent on the structure of the fusion protein as well as the regulatory mechanism for its activation. Both processes are probably controlled through allosteric mechanisms. We suggest that most viral families rely on a series of 'sensing' events that control protein disulfide bond linkages, glycosylation, acylation, phosphorylation, oligomerization and transport to the appropriate cellular membrane for viral budding. These sensors respond to pH, redox and lipid environment as the proteins are assembled and transported through the host secretory pathway [53] to allosterically enhance assembly and ensure productive spike formation.",

            "text": "Concluding remarks and future directions: interfering with conformational change and control during viral assembly Although targeting specific conformations is an attractive antiviral strategy, we further propose that one should consider the dynamic nature of virus assembly and that interfering with the allosteric responses to effectors and environmental sensors could be equally beneficial. Both capsid and glycoprotein assembly are carefully orchestrated events requiring activation by known and unidentified effectors. For example, we have learned from the HAP molecules that interfering with assembly is not equivalent to inhibiting assembly. In addition, weak interactions between protein subunits or glycoprotein complexes minimize production of misassembled spikes. Thus, altering the kinetics, misdirecting the intermediates, stabilizing an interaction to prevent disassembly are all viable options that disrupt a highly evolved set of reactions to achieve the same end goal: reduced virus propagation.",
