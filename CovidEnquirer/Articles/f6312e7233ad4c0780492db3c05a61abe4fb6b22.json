However, no approved vaccines or anti-viral therapeutics exist. CoVs assemble by budding into the lumen of the early Golgi prior to exocytosis. The small CoV E protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro. The E protein from the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system, which requires residues in the HD. Mutation of the HD of IBV E during infection results in impaired growth kinetics, impaired release of infectious virions, accumulation of IBV S protein on the plasma membrane when compared IBV WT infected cells, and aberrant cleavage of IBV S on the surface of virions. We previously reported the formation of two distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E in transfected and infected cells. Disruption of the secretory pathway by IBV E correlates with a form that is likely monomeric, suggesting that the effects on the secretory pathway are independent of E ion channel activity. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the monomeric form of IBV E correlates with a rise in the pH of the Golgi lumen.",

            "text": "One of the more fascinating and relatively enigmatic aspects of CoV biology is that CoV virions bud into the lumen of the secretory pathway at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) , and then must navigate through the Golgi and the anterograde endomembrane system to be efficiently released from the host cell. It has been demonstrated that the structure and function of the Golgi depends upon an acidic pH gradient that decreases from the lumen of the cis-Golgi to the lumen of the trans-Golgi. This pH gradient is produced by a balance maintained by proton influx into the lumen of the Golgi, proton leak, and counter-ion conductance (4) . Pharmacological manipulations of the pH gradient, resulting in neutralization of the lumen, have all been shown to cause slow trafficking of cargo through the Golgi as well as alteration in Golgi morphology (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . A class of small viral membrane proteins with ion channel activity, called viroporins, have been shown to have dramatic effects on the secretory pathway, similar to those elicited by pharmacological manipulation of luminal pH (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) .Several well-studied members of this viroporin family of proteins include the Influenza A M2 protein (IAV M2), hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 protein, and the CoV envelope (E) protein. These representative viroporins demonstrate several common functional features despite differences in viral assembly and budding locations. It has been suggested the role of M2 in the secretory .

Overexpression of M2 causes secretory pathway disruption where the rate of intracellular trafficking is slowed and Golgi morphology is altered (8). HCV p7 is also thought to play a protective role by allowing egress of viral structural proteins through the secretory pathway. HCV can be partially rescued by both pharmacological neutralization of the luminal spaces by bafilomycin A1 and by in trans expression of IAV M2 (9, 10) . Similar to M2, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) coronavirus E protein elicits multiple secretory pathway disruption phenotypes when overexpressed in mammalian cells.",

We previously reported that the E protein of IBV is expressed in mammalian cells is found in two pools by velocity gradient analysis: a low molecular weight pool (LMW) and a high molecular weight pool (HMW) (26). The LMW pool represents IBV E in a monomeric state while the HMW pool correlates with a homo-oligomer of IBV E. When mutations corresponding to the conserved HD residues of SARS-CoV E that inhibit ion channel activity were made in IBV E (T16A and A26F), we found that the HD mutants segregated primarily into one oligomeric pool or the other. The E T16A mutant was primarily in the HMW pool while the E A26F mutant was found primarily in the LMW pool. The presence of the LMW pool of IBV E, the predominant and likely monomeric form found when E A26F is present, correlates with the secretory pathway disruption associated with the WT IBV E protein (26). This was surprising in that it suggested an E ion channel-independent role for IBV E associated with manipulation of the secretory pathway. It was recently reported that that these HD mutants do abolish ion channel activity of IBV E in artificial membranes, and virus titers are reduced by a log in the supernatant of infected cells, suggesting a defect in virion release (27).

We suggest that increased trafficking and aberrant cleavage of the IBV S protein observed during IBV EG3 infection may reflect the detrimental effect of normal pH on IBV S processing. We demonstrate that IBV S processing and trafficking is similarly aberrant when coexpressed with EG3 but not WT E, and that IAV M2 can substitute for WT E to protect S from premature cleavage.",

We used flow cytometric analysis of a ratiometric pHluorin molecule targeted to the Golgi with a reporter consisting of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) pHluorin molecule fused to the membrane targeting sequence of the TGN38 trans-Golgi network resident protein (28) . We chose to use the trans-Golgi network pHluorin because the TGN is the most acidic compartment of the Golgi and thus any alteration in pH would likely be most detectable in this compartment. We generated a clonal Vero cell line that stably expressed the TGN38-pHluorin ( Figure 1A ). The generation of this cell line allowed us to ensure that all infected cells were expressing the TGN38-pHluorin. The cells were treated with cycloheximide for 60 minutes to chase newly synthesized TGN38-pHluorin from the ER. To generate a pH calibration curve, cells expressing the Golgi pHluorin molecule were subjected to treatment with buffers ranging from pH 5.5 to 7.5 in the presence of the ionophores monensin and nigericin prior to flow analysis ( Figure 1B) . The emission ratios of the biphasic pH-sensitive pHluorin at these known pH values can then be used to predict the Golgi luminal pH in cells The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

In addition, we analyzed the EG3 mutant of IBV E, in which the entire HD of IBV E was replaced by a heterologous HD sequence.

This suggested that the LMW pool of IBV E correlates with the luminal pH increase of the Golgi in addition to the secretory pathway disruption demonstrated in our previous work (23, 26, 29). The same experiment was performed with a medial-Golgi pHluorin, GnT1-pHluorin (Gnt1, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I), to assess if the alteration in pH was specific to the TGN. Indeed, both IBV E and IBV E A26F elicited a robust pH increase ( Figure 3B ). Interesting, IBV E T16A increased the pH significantly, though not as robustly as IBV E and IBV E A26F . We found that the pH of the trans-Golgi (measured with TGN38-pHluorin) was higher than the medial-Golgi (measured with GnT1-pHluorin). This was unexpected and is addressed in the discussion.

Despite intense efforts we were unable to conclusively determine whether an increase in Golgi pH could rescue the deficiencies of the IBV EG3 virus. We tried drugs that neutralize acidic compartments (baflinomycin A1, monensin and ammonium chloride), as well as overexpression of influenza A M2, a pH activated proton channel (4). However, the drugs inhibited exocytosis at all concentrations used (during short or long infections), and, we were unable to obtain a high percentage of M2transfected cells that were subsequently infected with IBV-EG3. In several experiments where the percent of transfected and infected cells was greater than 40%, we obtained 40-75% increases in release of infectious IBV-EG3 virus, but most experiments failed to show a reasonable overlap of transfection and infection and rescue of IBV-EG3 infectivity (data not shown). Additionally, attempts to make stable lines expressing M2 and pHluorin did not yield lines expressing M2 at a high enough level to alter the Golgi pH. We thus turned to another approach to assess the role of neutralization of the Golgi by IBV E during infection.

The IBV S protein is cleaved by a furin-like protease generating the S1 and S2 subunits during trafficking through the Golgi, and at a second site (S2') that primes the protein for fusion with the host cell (30) .The S protein of IBV-EG3 is subject to further proteolysis near the junction of the protein with the viral envelope, resulting in a C-terminal fragment we term the 'stub' (22). We predicted that neutralization of Golgi pH by IBV E during infection protects the IBV S protein from premature proteolysis at the normal acidic pH of the trans-Golgi. We also The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/440628 doi: bioRxiv preprint presence of M2 were also observed at the cell surface, though the differences were not significant. Values for the TGN38-pHluorin in different cell types range from pH 6.2-6.7 (28, 31, 32) . We believe that the slightly higher baseline measurement we observed is likely due to some plasma membrane cycling of the TGN38-pHluorin, which would increase the average pH in a given cell since the pH of the extra cellular buffer was pH 7.3. The cycling of TGN38-pHlorin is likely to be the predominant reason for a higher than expected TGN pH, since the medial-Golgi pHluorin reported a pH of ~6.4. We believe that the consistent shift in the Golgi pH in cells expressing IBV E is more important than the actual baseline pH value we observed with the TGN38-pHlorin. Previously, the TGN38-pHluorin construct was used to demonstrate that However, the IBV E T16A or IBV EG3 HD mutants did not cause a statistically significant shift (0.20 and 0.12 pH units, respectively). We previously showed that the LMW pool of IBV E correlates with the secretory pathway disruption, including Golgi disassembly and slow trafficking of model cargo proteins, observed when the wild-type IBV E protein is expressed (23, 29) . We hypothesized that the Golgi disruption was likely occurring in an IBV E ion channelindependent manner (26, 29). This study corroborates our hypothesis and suggests that the that proteolytic processing at two cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2') releases the protein from its prefusion conformation and allows for a conformational change that exposes the fusion peptide (33) . This change in conformation may also release the S1 subunits from The S2 subunits of the CoV S trimer (33) . A possible detrimental consequence of the normal acidic Golgi pH to the virus could be that the S protein is subject to a conformational change and premature and possibly excessive proteolytic processing, resulting in release of the S1 subunit prior to receptor binding. This would result in noninfectious or impaired virions. Here we demonstrate that when IBV S is overexpressed in cells in the presence of EG3, the levels of IBV S cleavage species are increased significantly as compared to IBV S in the presence of IBV E or IAV M2, lending support to the hypothesis that the neutralization of Golgi pH by IBV E protects IBV S from premature cleavage. Additionally, when over expressed in cells IBV S is present to a greater extent at the cell surface, corroborating previous data observed during IBV EG3 infection (23).",

            "text": "replace the hydrophobic domain (HD) of IBV E with the HD of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G), and the recombinant virus was called IBV EG3 (22, 23). Replacing the HD of IBV E with a heterologous sequence of the same length does not impair Golgi targeting or interaction with IBV M during assembly (24, 25), but would be expected to impair ion channel function. One-step growth curves revealed that IBV EG3 virus grew to a titer 10-fold lower than IBV WT virus in infected Vero cells. At late times post-infection, the majority of infectious virus resides in the supernatant surrounding IBV WT infected cells, while the majority of infectious IBV EG3 virus is intracellular (23). Vero cells infected with IBV EG3 accumulate more IBV S protein on the plasma membrane than IBV WT infected cells and this accumulation of IBV S leads to an increase in the size and rate of formation of the virus-induced syncytia (23). Most virions purified from IBV EG3 infected cells lack a full complement of spikes and S is aberrantly cleaved near the virion envelope, potentially explaining the reduced infectivity of released particles (22). A build-up of vacuole-like compartments containing virions as well as other aberrant material in IBV EG3 infected cells may explain the damage to S (22, 23). Intriguingly, when IBV WT E is transiently overexpressed in HeLa cells, the Golgi completely disassembles while the Golgi in cells overexpressing IBV EG3 is intact (23).

To test these predictions, we first demonstrated that when transiently overexpressed in Vero cells, IAV M2 neutralized the trans-Golgi in our pHluorin/ flow cytometry assay in the absence of the M2 inhibitor amantadine, but not in the presence of 5 \u00b5M amantadine as expected (Figure 4, (5-8)). With proof of principal established for M2 pH alteration during transfection, cells were cotransfected with IBV S and IBV E, or IBV EG3, with or without the IAV M2 protein. Surface biotinylation was performed, and the quantity of cleaved and uncleaved IBV S species in cell lysates and at the cell surface after streptavidin pull-down were determined by western blot analysis (Figure 5A). As predicted there was a significant increase in the total amount of IBV S at the surface of EG3 expressing cells as compared to WT IBV E. Notably, the presence of M2 in EG3 expressing cells reduced the amount IBV S at the surface of cells to a level comparable to cells expressing WT IBV E (Figure 5B.). Additionally, the total amounts of cleaved IBV S species (S2, S2', and stub) were significantly increased in cell lysates expressing EG3 when compared to WT IBV E, and the presence of M2 in EG3 expressing cells reduced the amount of cleaved IBV S species back to levels comparable with cells expressing WT IBV E (Figure 5C).

Overexpression of IBV E caused a similar increase in the pH of the lumen of the trans-Golgi and also increased the pH of the medial-Golgi. The average baseline measurement for TGN38-pHluorin in three independent experiments in which ~5000 cells were measured was pH 6.78. While the presence of overexpressed IBV M did not significantly increase the pH of the Golgi, the presence of overexpressed IBV E significantly increased the pH to 7.06, an increase of 0.28 pH units. In infected Vero cells where ~8,000 cells were analyzed per experiment, a pH increase of 0.35 pH units from the uninfected baseline measurement of pH 6.76 to infected pH of 7.11 suggested the pH increase may be physiologically important. Our baseline measurement of pH 6.78 in the context of transient overexpression of the TGN38-pHluorin and IBV E protein in HeLa cells, and the baseline of 6.76 in the context of Vero cells stably expressing the TGN38-pHluorin are both similar, though somewhat higher, than pH values reported in the literature for the TGN.",

This interpretation is strengthened by evidence suggesting that neither the IBV E T16A or IBV E A26F mutants have ion channel activity in artificial membranes (27), suggesting that any remaining HMW weight, oligomeric IBV E that may be present when IBV E A26F is expressed is not likely eliciting secretory pathway disruption or pH neutralization via IBV E ion channel activity. However, To et al. suggest that mutation of IBV E T16A and not IBV E A26F prevents oligomerization of IBV E, the opposite of our findings. The difference in these results is likely due to different modes of protein expression and the downstream assays used to evaluate oligomerization. In our studies we expressed the HD mutants in mammalian cells and evaluated oligomerization via sucrose gradient analysis followed by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of gradient fractions of interest (26).

            "text": "-CoV E PBM domain was made more evident in studies addressing SARS-CoV infection with viruses lacking the E protein(40). During passage in tissue culture viruses lacking the E gene incorporated a partial duplication of the M gene in which novel and variable PBM domains were incorporated into the chimeric M gene(40). Similarly, deletion of the E gene in recombinant MHV has also been shown to result in partial duplication of M gene(41). When SARS-CoV lacking the E protein was passaged in mice a partial duplication of the 8a proteinoccurred, which contained a novel PBM domain in the chimeric 8a protein. It is worth noting that not all CoV E proteins have a PBM. In fact, IBV E lacks a PBM. It is tempting to speculate that relatively long C-terminus of IBV E compared to SARS-CoV E provides for the potential for host protein interaction in absence of a PBM domain. The differences in the length and relevant domains in the C-terminus of CoV E proteins are of interest in the field. Interestingly, SARS-CoV 3a and 8a proteins have been shown to have ion-channel activity in artificial membranes in addition to E (39, 42-44). Intriguingly, the SARS-CoV 3a protein elicits inflammatory signaling similar to the SARS-CoV E protein, suggesting that CoVs may encode accessory proteins that i) may overlap in function to the E protein or ii) that may substitute for a particular role of the multifunctional E protein. Additionally, the SARS-CoV 3a protein has been show to induce Golgi fragmentation as an antagonist to the Arf1 GTPase involved in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi (45). Further study of these SARS-CoV viroporins outside the complicated context of infection, especially their ability to induce pH changes in the lumen of the secretory pathway, may inform our studies on the IBV E protein.Whether the endogenous role of putative IBV E interacting protein(s) be pH maintenance, vesicle formation, membrane architecture, protein glycosylation or any number of jobs performed by constituents of the secretory pathway, interaction of the protein(s) or lipid(s)",
