            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a global public health issue due to its association with severe 33 developmental disorders in infants and neurological disorders in adults. Because ZIKV uses 34 glycosylation of its envelope (E) protein to interact with host cell receptors to facilitate entry, 35 these interactions could also be important for designing therapeutics and vaccines. Due to a lack 36 of information about Asn-linked (N-glycans) on ZIKV E, we analyzed ZIKV E of various strains 37 derived from different cells. ZIKV E proteins are extensively modified with oligomannose-, 38 hybrid-and complex-N-glycans of a highly heterogeneous nature. Host cell-surface glycans 39 correlated strongly with the glycomic features of ZIKV E. Mechanistically, we discovered that 40 ZIKV N-glycans are important in viral pathogenesis, as mannose-specific C-type lectins DC-41 SIGN and L-SIGN mediate cell entry of ZIKV. Our findings represent the first detailed mapping 42 of N-glycans on ZIKV E of various strains and their functional significance.",

Recently, 47 the considerable increase in ZIKV infection rates has raised urgent global urgent concerns, 48 especially after the outbreaks in Yap Islands (2007) 3,4 , French Polynesia (2013) 5,6 , Easter Island 49 (2014) 7 , and Brazil (2015) 8,9 . These ZIKV outbreaks were associated with a sharp increase in 50 cases of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease featured by weakening and 51 paralysis of the limbs and face. In 2015, Zika spread to South and Central America, infecting 52 thousands of people in Brazil and Colombia, where it was associated with an increase in GBS 53 rates as well as a significant increase in severe fetal abnormalities including spontaneous 54 abortion, stillbirth, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, hydranencephaly/hydrops fetalis, and placental 55 insufficiency 10-14 . ZIKV is a small, enveloped positive-strand RNA virus 15 . The genomic RNA 56 of this mosquito-borne flavivirus contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a 57 polyprotein 16,17 . This polyprotein undergoes co-and post-translational processing to produce 58 three structural proteins, which are capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E), in 59 addition to seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) 17,18 . 60 Of the three structural proteins, E is the major surface glycoprotein, containing three domains (I, 61 II, III) and two transmembrane helices 17-19 . The majority of flaviviruses E proteins are post-62 translationally modified by N-glycans at amino acid 153/154 within a highly conserved 63 glycosylation motif of N-X-T/S at positions 154-156 (where X is any amino acid except proline) 64 16 . This is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies and is required for virus entry 20 .",

When produced in 103 C6/36, Vero, THP-1, and SNB19 cells, these N-glycan profiles were heavily dominated by 104 sialylated glycans. For these four cell lines, bi-and tri-sialylated tri-antennary N-glycans (3241.8 105 m/z and 3603.0 m/z) were the most abundant found on ZIKV E, followed by bi-sialylated bi-106 antennary (2792.5 m/z) and tetra-sialylated tri-antennary (3964.2 m/z) N-glycans 107 (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b) . ZIKV E produced in SNB19 cells was also found to be decorated 108 with Man5 (1579.9 m/z), agalactosylated bisected (1907.1 m/z), core-fucosylated non-sialylated 109 bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z), and core-fucosylated mono-sialylated bi-antennary (2605.5 m/z) N-110 glycans (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). When expressed in the LLC-MK2 and JEG-9 cell lines, the 111 N-glycan profiles of MR766 and IbH strains of E were markedly different. When produced in 112 LLC-MK2 cells, bi-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.5 m/z) and core-fucosylated agalactosylated 113 (1836.0 m/z) N-glycans were by far the two most abundant glycan species (Supplementary Fig. 114 4a, b). More complex N-glycans, with three or more sialic acids and additional lactosamine 115 repeats, were not identified in ZIKV E expressed in LLC-MK2 cells. Finally, the ZIKV E 116 produced in JEG-3 cells revealed a different N-glycosylation pattern between MR766 and IbH 117 strains. While the di-and tri-sialylated N-glycans (2792.5, 3241.8, and 3603.0 m/z) were the 118 most abundant for the MR766 ZIKV-E produced in JEG-3, the variety of N-glycans identified in 119 JEG-3 cells was greater, notably including Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (1579.9 m/z), Man 6 GlcNAc 2 (1784.0 120 m/z), Man 7 GlcNAc 2 (1988.1 m/z), Man 8 GlcNAc 2 (2192.2 m/z), asialo bi-antennary (2070.2 121 m/z), and core fucosylated asialo-bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z) N-glycans (Supplementary Fig.   122 4a). In contrast, the IbH strain produced in the JEG-3 cells displayed a more restricted N-glycan 123 profile, with the notable absence of sialylated N-glycans and with the core fucosylated asialo-bi-124 All rights reserved.

The core-fucosylated agalactosylated (1836.0 m/z) and mono-sialylated bi-140 antennary (2431.4 m/z) were, respectively, the second and third most relatively abundant N-141 glycans reported (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d) . Lastly, the N-glycan profiles of the PRVABC59 142 and FLR strains of E expressed in JEG-3 cells showed a lower abundance of highly sialylated N-143 glycans such as the tri-and tetra-sialylated tri-antennary N-glycans (3603.0 and 3964.2 m/z) 144 compared to the virus produced in the C6/36, Vero, THP-1, and SNB19 cells. By contrast, the E 145 of the PRVABC59 strain showed an increased abundance of both mono-sialylated N-glycans 146 (2431.4 and 2880.6 m/z) and non-sialylated N-glycans (2040.2, 2070.2 and 2244 .3 m/z). 147 All rights reserved.

In both of these cell lines, the major N-glycans found were Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (1579.9 m/z), 150 asialo-bi-antennary (2070.2 m/z), and core fucosylated asialo-bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z) N-151 glycans (Supplementary Fig. 4e) . When produced in LLC-MK2 cells, however, the N-glycan 152 profile of the E protein from the SJRP strain was comparable to the profiles found for the four 153 other strains, with the di-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.6 m/z) and the core-fucosylated 154 agalactosylated (1836.1 m/z) N-glycans being the most abundant. Contrasting the other E 155 proteins produced in C6/36, LLC-MK2 and Vero cells, Man5 (1579.9 m/z) was found to be the 156 most abundant N-glycan on the SJRP strain. However, the N-glycan profiles generated from the 157 E protein of SJRP strain expressed in THP-1, SNB19, and JEG-3 cells revealed a high relative 158 abundance of di-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.5 m/z), tri-antennary (3241.8 m/z), and tri-159 sialylated tri-antennary (3603.0 m/z) with little to no expression of less complex non-sialylated 160 N-glycans such as Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (Supplementary Fig. 4e) . 161 The major proportion (> 5%) of N-glycan spectra at 3603.0 mz, 3241.8 mz, 2792.6 mz, 3964.2 162 mz, 1836.0 mz, and 2040.2 mz were identified on ZIKV E produced in these cell lines.

This approach relies on specificities of 173 immobilized lectins that recognize specific glycan features on cell surface glycoproteins, 174 resulting in their binding to the array. These data revealed that different cell lines harbor 175 differential cell-surface glycosylation (Fig. 3) that might impact the glycosylation of the virus 176 produced in these cells.

The results of our study also revealed a high heterogeneity in the N-272 glycans linked to ZIKV E among different ZIKV strains that are produced by the same host cell. 273 For example, Vero cells produced ZIKV E linked to various N-glycans among ZIKV strains 274 including FRL, IbH, PRVABC59, and MR766. Unlike other flaviviruses, ZIKV E contains a 275 conserved sequence of ~ ten amino acids that surround the N154 glycosylation site. This 276 conserved sequence may affect the glycosylation process, carbohydrate moiety, and attachment 277 site of the ZIKV to host cells 18 . The number and location of glycosylation motifs in the E vary 278 considerably both between and within flaviviruses 52 , altering the pathogenicity of these viruses 279 and the severity of their diseases.

This host cell-dependent glycosylation process of ZIKV E 290 could thus have wide ranging implications regarding the pathogenicity and infectivity of the 291 virus. However, future research is required to evaluate the full extent of this circumstance.292In regard to infection of cells, we explored ZIKV interactions with cellular lectins that bind 293 specific types of glycans we identified on the virus. DC-SIGN is a lectin-like molecule, 294 expressed in dendritic cells that can facilitate virus entry through its binding affinity with the 295 glycans on the E protein 55 . N154 glycosylation was found to play a role in ZIKV infection of296 mammalian cells through this entry factor DC-SIGN 48 . Indeed, the glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) 297 of C-type lectins, including DC-SIGN, have a binding affinity as an attachment factor for host 298 cell entry of ZIKV similar to other pathogenic flaviviruses 56 . We also observed a significant 299 decrease in ZIKV infection in DC-SIGN and L-SIGN expressing cells in the presence of 300 competitive inhibitors rich in mannose. As a result, the presence of monoclonal antibodies to 301 various C-type lectins, the competitive inhibitors rich in mannose, or antiviral gene therapy may 302 be able to reduce ZIKV replication by impairing the binding between viral N-glycan of E protein 303 and GAGs of DC-SIGN. Recent reports suggest that the cells expressing DC-SIGN, such as 304 human dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, and immature dendritic cells, are permissive 305 to the most recent ZIKV isolates. This may have contributed to the epidemic in French Polynesia 306 in 2013 where the cell entry mechanism of ZIKV strain PF-2013 to various cell lines was shown mediated by a range of receptors and molecules including DC-SIGN 57 . The accessibility of 308 ZIKV PF-2013 strain, the original strain initiated in the recent outbreaks of ZIKV in South and 309 Central American regions, to different entry cell receptors possibly provides an evolutionary 310 advantage for this recent ZIKV strain to infect a wide range of target cells and evade the immune 311 system of human host. Taken together, these phenomena may partially explain the alterations in 312 the mechanisms of pathogenesis and tissue tropism of these recent ZIKV strains. Further studies 313 are needed to determine the impact of host glycosylation variability on ZIKV pathogenesis and 314 infectivity in vivo. 315 In conclusion, our findings provide a first-of-its-kind detailed repertoire of N-glycans linked to 316 the ZIKV envelope. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive mapping on the glycome 317 of ZIKV E in different physiologically relevant cell lines. Our study showed that the N-glycans 318 linked to ZIKV E produced by both insect and various mammalian cells are highly heterogenous 319 in structure and composition. Both African and Asian lineage strains showed very similar N-320 glycosylation patterns of ZIKV E. We also noticed that the N-glycan pattern of the ZIKV E 321 depends on not only virus strain characteristics but also on cell line type. We showed that ZIKV 322 infection in DC-SIGN and L-SIGN expressing cells was significantly decreased in the presence 323 of competitive inhibitors rich in mannose, suggesting an important role for these lectin-like 324 molecules as cell entry factors in pathogenesis, emerging new strains of ZIKV and alternative 325 targets for therapeutic development.
