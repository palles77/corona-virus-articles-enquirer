            "text": "A novel coronavirus (CoV) has been described in association with cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The virus, SARS-CoV, differs from the previously described human coronaviruses, 229E and OC43. 229E was previously shown to productively infect human monocytes/macrophages, whereas OC43 poorly infected the cells. In this study, we examined whether SARS-CoV could productively infect purified monocytes/macrophages (PM) derived from human donor cells. Unlike 229E-infected cells, which produced viral titers of 10 3.5 to 10 6 TCID 50 /ml, SARS-CoV replicated poorly in PM, producing titers of 10 1.75 to 10 2 TCID 50 /ml. This finding was similar to results reported for OC43-infected cells, with titers ranging from 10 1.2 to 10 2.7 TCID 50 /ml. Of interest, SARS-CoV proteins were detected only in PM that did not produce significant amounts of interferon (IFN)-\u2423, and in one such case, preliminary electron microscope studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-like particles could enter the cells, possibly via phagocytosis. These results suggest that SARS-CoV, like human CoV OC43, poorly infects human PM, and production of IFN-\u2423 by these cells further limits the infection. Given the importance of monocytes/macrophages to the immune response, it is possible that their infection by SARS-CoV and alteration of this infection by IFN-\u2423 may be important to the course of the infection in humans.

A number of coronaviruses have been described. They include the human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 and a number of animal coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (Stadler et al., 2003; Holmes, 2003) . The structural proteins of SARS-CoV include the large type I mem-cells by virions, which bud upon the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and migrate to the cell surface while within the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum, where they will then be extruded to the extracellular space (Ng et al., 2003a,b; Goldsmith et al., 2004) . Extracellular virus particles can be seen accumulating in large quantities along the plasma membranes of the infected cells (Ng et al., 2003b; Goldsmith et al., 2004) .",

It is well known that by producing IFN-\u2423/\u2424, monocytes/macrophages participate in inducing resistance to viral replication. The cytokines activate cellular genes that destroy viral mRNA and inhibit the translation of proteins. In addition, IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induce major histocompatibility complex class I protein expression in infected cells, increasing the level of protein presentation to CD8 + T cells and the ability of uninfected cells to resist killing by natural killer cells (Goodbourn et al., 2000) .",

We examined the age, race, and sex of the donors to determine whether any of these parameters influenced the response to SARS-CoV (Table 1) . Due to the small number of donors, we were unable to convincingly show that any of these factors influenced the results we obtained. Despite secreting low levels of IFN-\u2423, SARS-CoV proteins failed to be detected in Donor G. We were unable to identify a reason for this variation from the pattern seen with other donors.

Electron microscope studies suggested differences in the replication process between PM and the more permissive Vero E6 cells.

Most significantly, SARS-CoV infection of PM appeared to be inhibited by the presence of IFN-\u2423. SARS-CoV antigens were not detected in PM that produced significant levels of IFN-\u2423 (>10 U/ml); however, they were detected in PM producing <10 U/ml IFN-\u2423 (the PM were from four of six donors) and in cells producing significant levels of IFN-\u2423 after IFN-\u2423neutralizing antibody was added to the culture system.

For example, treatment of Vero E6 cells with IFN resulted in inhibition of SARS-CoV replication (Cinatl et al., 2003; Hensley et al., 2004; Spiegel et al., 2004; Str\u00f6her et al., 2004) . Expression of SARS-CoV proteins in type I pneumocytes of infected macaques was also severely reduced after prophylactic treatment of the SARS-CoV-infected monkeys with IFN-\u2423 (Haagmans et al., 2004) . A reduction in viral replication and excretion, in protein expression in pneumocytes, and in pulmonary damage were all noted in infected macaques who were treated compared with infected macaques who were not treated (Haagmans et al., 2004) . Our results showing that SARS-CoV infection of monocytes/macrophages can be modulated by IFN-\u2423 are consistent with these findings.",

            "text": "The role that SARS-CoV infection of monocytes/macrophages plays in the course of the disease in humans is yet to be determined. The role could be more important than would otherwise be indicated by the low level of productive infection, given the importance of these cells in guiding the immune response to infection through antigen presentation and cytokine production. Our data suggest that differences in levels of IFN-\u2423 production with infection may occur, as indicated by infection in monocytes/macrophages, and such differences could contribute to the disease course. For example, co-infection with a paramyxovirus, human metapneumovirus, has been noted in some SARS-infected patients, and this infection has been hypothesized to render some persons more susceptible to SARS-CoV disease Stephenson, 2003) . Although human metapneumovirus infections have not been described previously as interfering with IFN-mediated antiviral responses, other paramyxoviruses have been shown to interfere with such responses (Gotoh et al., 2001; Bossert et al., 2003) . Thus, it is possible that such interference could facilitate SARS-CoV infection. Another example where variability in IFN-\u2423 production could explain differences in disease outcome is the association between increasing severity of disease with increasing age. Young children appear to be the least suscep-tible and the elderly the most susceptible to serious complications of infection . It is known that IFN-\u2423 levels are highest in the young and decrease with age (Katschinski et al., 1994; Shodell and Siegal, 2002) . Perhaps age-associated variations in IFN-\u2423 production may help explain age-associated differences in SARS-CoV disease.",
