Vaccine-derived virus (VDV) has been isolated from foetuses, stillborn pigs, and dead piglets, indicating that the live vaccine spread from vaccinated piglets to non-vaccinated sows, and that the virus might be implicated in the severe reproductive problems observed. In the present study, one such VDV isolate was used to experimentally infect pregnant sows in the last trimester. The chosen isolate, which had more than 99.6% identity to the attenuated vaccine virus, originated from the lungs of a stillborn pig from a swine herd with a sudden high level of stillborn pigs and increased piglet mortality in the nursing period. Intranasal inoculation of sows with the virus isolate resulted in congenital infection, foetal death, and preweaning pig mortality. As such, the present study showed that vaccine-derived PRRSV can cause disease in swine consistent with PRRS. #",

To ensure detection of any type of PRRSV that might be present, clinical samples (serum, thoracic fluids, and lung/spleen tissue homogenates) were passaged in parallel in PPAM and in the MARC-145 cell line. After two passages, the cell cultures were stained using the mAb's reacting with European or American type PRRSV, as described above. Furthermore, the tissue homogenates were examined for the presence of other porcine viruses known to be present among Danish pigs, according to the standard procedures used at DVIVR.

None of the sows required obstetrical assistance. Gestation lengths did not differ significantly between principal sows (range 113-117 days) and control sows (range 114-115 days). Control sow 761 which had delivered nine live and one stillborn pig developed a severe metritis/mastitis on day 2 PF. Therefore, this sow and her litter were excluded from the experiment and euthanised. The remaining three control sows delivered a total of 39 live piglets ( Table 1) . Five of these were small and had birth weights lower than 900 g. However, the average birth weight for the control piglets was still 1297 g (sd 286 g). Neither stillborn pigs, mummified foetuses nor weakborn piglets were seen in the three control litters. However, six control piglets died between day 2 and 13 after birth ( Table 1 ). The finding of traumatic lesions in the head and/or body together with milk-filled stomachs, indicated these piglets to be crushed to death by the dams. In fact, no other explanations of death could be found for these piglets. The remaining control piglets survived with no other clinical signs than occasional slight diarrhoea. Clinically, the principal sows did not appear to be affected by the PRRSV infection, except for sow 882 which had decreased milk production. Therefore, the litter of this sow was supplied with milk replacer from day 2 after birth. In total, the six principal sows delivered 66 liveborn pigs and 20 deadborn pigs, an average of 3.3 or 25% deadborn pigs per principal sow (Table 1 ). The level of delivered deadborn pigs was significantly higher \u00f0p < 0:05\u00de for the principal sows than for the three control sows which did not deliver any deadborn pigs (Table 1 ). There was no significant difference between principal and control sows in the level of total pigs born. The deadborn principal pigs comprised two stillborn pigs, and 18 dead foetuses with varying degrees of autolysis and mummification. Ten liveborn principal pigs had birth weights lower than 900 g, and the average birth weight of liveborn principal pigs was 1225 g (sd 283 g). Eight piglets appeared weak at birth, and one of these with a birth weight just below 400 g was euthanised immediately after blood sampling. In general, neonatal pigs in the control group appeared considerably more vigorous and thrifty compared to those in the principal group. During the observation period, another 13 principal piglets died ( Table 1) . None of these deaths could be attributed to crushing by the sows. Furthermore, the health status of the surviving principals varied considerably. Varying degrees of unthriftiness were seen between as well as within the principal litters. Neither coughing nor other clear signs of respiratory disease were observed in any of the principal piglets, and as time progressed, the general health improved for the majority of the principal piglets. At the end of the observation period, however, only the surviving piglets from sows 641 and 721 appeared to have fully recovered.",

This assertion is based on fulfilment of the postulates of Koch (see, Levine, 1996) : The virus isolated from the disease was cultured in vitro and characterised as PRRS-VDV.

In addition, we observed signs of severe bacterial pneumonia as well as generalised bacterial infection in a number of the congenitally infected piglets, but not in any of the control piglets.

That almost all piglets were found to be viremic at 10 days of age, was probably due to a horizontal transmission of virus from in utero infected pigs to non-infected litter-mates during the early period of life, as also described by Mengeling et al.

This has raised the question as to whether the observed clinical symptoms were caused by the vaccine virus or by other pathogens. The present study, however, provides strong evidence that the problems were primarily the result of infection with the PRRS-VDV. The sporadic bacteriological findings did not indicate a primary role of bacteria. However, especially the pathogenic bacteria, e.g. staphylococci, found in some of the principal piglets may very well have played a secondary role in the development and severity of actual disease in individual animals. Furthermore, the fact that none of the sows seroconverted to any other viruses, and that attempts to isolate other viruses than PRRS-VDV remained negative, strongly indicated that no other viruses than PRRSV were involved. Finally, differentiating RT-PCR performed on both the original isolate, the virus inoculum itself, and on serum from two principal piglets excluded any role of European type PRRSV.",

We suggest that a number of unique circumstances existed regarding the use of the live PRRSV vaccine in Denmark, as outlined in the following: (i) No North American wild type of PRRSV was present in Denmark, so the spread of the vaccine virus was easy to monitor. (ii) The vaccine was used solely in piglets in herds seropositive towards European type of PRRSV, and with the majority of the herds having no or minor clinical PRRSV-associated problems at the time of vaccination. (iii) The simultaneous (within few months) use of the vaccine in more than 1100 herds made it much easier to detect vaccine reversion. (iv) Due to the coordinated vaccination-program, the vaccinating herds were followed very closely.",

That particular isolate (16244B) had 212 nucleotide substitutions when compared to the vaccine virus (Allende et al., 2000) and produced reproductive disorders comparable to those caused by the VR-2332 isolate parental to the vaccine virus . Compared to the present results, Allende et al. (2000) observed a more pronounced clinical effect after infection of pregnant sows at 90 days of gestation with the 16244B isolate. Thus, these authors found a reduced level of liveborn pigs (57% in contrast to 77% in our study) with a parallel increase of stillborn pigs (43% in contrast to 23% in our study). Furthermore, the rate of survival at 10 days after farrowing was much lower (29%) than in the present study (80%). The present PRRS-VDV isolate which was collected approximately 6 months after the introduction of the vaccine into Denmark had only 63 nucleotide differences when compared to the vaccine virus (Nielsen et al., 2001) . This higher level of sequence identity to the attenuated vaccine virus may explain the apparently reduced mortality when compared to the 16244B isolate, and may indicate -as also speculated by others (Mengeling et al., 1999) -that the genetic reversion to virulence happens gradually with prolonged time of passage of the vaccine virus in the field.",
