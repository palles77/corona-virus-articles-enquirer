            "text": "Recently, the coding-complete BAV genome sequence (13,296 nt) was determined (Lauck et To further understand which cell types tibrovirus particles may enter and in which cell 133 types authentic tibroviruses may replicate, we exposed 53 human, 11 bat, 7 nonhuman primate, 1 134 hispid cotton rat, 1 boa constrictor, and 1 Asian tiger mosquito cell lines to newly established 135 infectious recombinant vesicular stomatitis Indiana viruses (rVSIVs) encoding the eight diverse 136 tibrovirus Gs and to four authentic tibroviruses (BAV, CPV, SWBV, and TIBV). The obtained 137 rVSIV infections rates, which reflect tibrovirus particle cell entry (host cell susceptibility), 138 indicate that particles of all tibroviruses, not only those of BASV, easily enter a broad range of 139 human and non-human cells. We confirm pH dependency of BASV G-mediated entry, show that 140 tibrovirus particle cell entry is likely dynamin-dependent and cholesterol-independent, and 141 extrapolate these findings to all tibroviruses. Using the four authentic tibroviruses and cross-142 reacting anti-tibrovirus N antibodies in western blots, we demonstrate, however, that many cell 143 lines that are susceptible to tibrovirus G-mediated particle entry are not likely to be permissive to 144 replication of most tibroviruses after particle entry. Kleinfelter et al., 2015) to yield 161 rVSIV-BAV G, rVSIV-BHV G, rVSIV-CPV G, and rVSIV-TIBV G, respectively ( Figure 1A) . 162 The sequences of the G-encoding regions of all created rVISV genomes were confirmed to be 163 identical to those of the respective GenBank accession numbers by Sanger sequencing. Primers 164 were designed to amplify rVSIV-tibrovirus G-encoding regions by RT-PCR, and these fragments 165 were sequenced by Macrogen, Rockville, MD, USA. All rVSIVs were rescued, grown, and were designed using Antigen Profiler software (ThermoFisher Scientific). Two 19-mers were 268 designed, produced, and injected into rabbits by the company. Rabbit sera containing antibodies 269 were harvested and purified by the company 72 days after peptide injection. To detect authentic 270 tibroviruses, virus-exposed cells were harvested and lysed using Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Tris Gels (ThermoFisher Scientific), and gels were run with MOPS SDS Running Buffer 277 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Gels were dry-transferred using the iBlot 2 Gel Transfer Device 278 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Primary antibodies were diluted to 1:1,000; goat anti-rabbit IgG 279 coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma Aldrich) was diluted to 1:3,000.

SWBV was originally isolated in 1981 from biting midges 120 (Culicoides insignis) together with BAV in Florida, USA (Gibbs et al., 1989). Anti-SWBV 121 antibodies have been detected in healthy Trinidad water buffaloes (Calisher et al., 1993). BHV was 122 first reported in 1984 as a novel virus of biting midges (Culicoides peregrinus) that were 123 collected at Beatrice Hill, Northern Territory, Australia (Standfast et al., 1984). 124 Beyond sequencing, very little research has been performed on any tibrovirus. Results of 125 recent studies revealed structural elements of the BASV U1 protein (Buchko et al., 2017) and 126 indicated that tibrovirus U3 encodes a small viroporin-like transmembrane protein (Walker et al., 127 2015). In addition, it is suspected that BASV G encodes a class III fusion glycoprotein (G) 128 (Steffen et al., 2013). BASV G mediates pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV) 129 particle entry into a variety of human and nonhuman cells in a pH-dependent manner (Steffen et 130 al., 2013). However, whether such particle cell entry (susceptibility) can be correlated to actual 131 BASV replication (permissiveness) in the same cells remains unclear.",

Cell entry is thought to occur after G engages virus-specific cell-surface 292 receptors or attachment factors (Bearzotti et al., 1999; Lafon, 2005; Finkelshtein et al., 2013) and 293 subsequently mediates low-pH-induced viral and endosomal membrane fusion (Florkiewicz and 294 Rose, 1984; Blumenthal et al., 1987; Sun et al., 2005). Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV; 295 Rhabdoviridae: Vesiculovirus: Indiana vesiculovirus) has an extremely broad, close-to-universal, 296 cellular tropism. This broad tropism is due the fact that most cells are susceptible to VSIV G-297 mediated virus particle entry (cells allow virion entry) and that most cells are also permissive to 298 VSIV replication after particle entry (cells do not restrict virus replication or virion egress) 299 (Hastie et al., 2013). Using reverse genetics to create recombinant VSIV (rVSIV), VSIV G can 300 easily be replaced with other mononegaviral glycoproteins, thereby possibly changing the 301 receptor engagement of the rVSIV to that of G of the heterotypic virus, while likely maintaining 302 the ability of the recombinant virus to replicate in most cells after particle entry (change of cell 303 susceptibility while maintaining the same cell permissiveness). Therefore, rVSIVs expressing 304 heterotypic Gs can be used to perform well-controlled, initial cell susceptibility evaluations of G 305 from heterotypic viruses without including the authentic heterotypic viruses in the experiment 306 (Garbutt et al., 2004; Tani et al., 2011; Hastie et al., 2013; Moreira et al., 2016; Robinson and Whelan, 307 2016; Raaben et al., 2017; Jangra et al., 2018). This approach is especially useful when the actual 308 heterotypic viruses are only known from sequences, i.e., have not been isolated in culture (e.g., 309 Bas-Congo virus [BASV], Ekpoma virus 1 [EKV-1], Ekpoma virus 2 [EKV-2]).",

As expected, rVSIV-VSIV321 G control infected almost all cell lines, with the notable exceptions of one central nervous system 322 (CNS) cancer cell line (SNB-75) and one renal cancer cell line (RXF-393). Hence, these two cell 323 lines are not susceptible, not permissive, or not susceptible and not permissive to VSIV infection. Tibrovirus cell entry 9 rVSIV-VSIV G control infection occurred in 100% of cells in 25 of the 53 tested cell lines, and 325 infection efficiency was approximately \u226450% in 8 of them (Figure 1B). 326 Due to the overall known broad cell tropism of VSIV (Hastie et al., 2013), and assuming 327 that VSIV uses a different cell-surface receptor or attachment factor than tibroviruses, we 328 expected rVSIVs expressing tibrovirus Gs in place of VSIV G to enter fewer cell lines with less 329 efficiency than rVSIV-VSIV G control. Assuming that within-cell VSIV restriction factors do 330 not target G, we further surmised that rVSIV-VSIV G control and rVSIVs expressing a 331 tibrovirus G would replicate at similar efficiencies in cells that permit entry of both viruses, i.e., 332 that these cells would be equally permissive. Interestingly, rVSIV-BAV (3 negative cell lines, 19 333 cell lines with \u2248100% infection efficiency), rVSIV-BASV (4 negative cell lines, 11 cell lines 334 with \u2248100% infection efficiency), rVSIV-SWBV (6 negative cell lines, 21 cell lines with \u2248100% 335 infection efficiency), and rVSIV-TIBV (5 negative cell lines, 23 cell lines with \u2248100% infection 336 efficiency) fulfilled the first assumption, but not necessarily the second (Figure 2). Even more 337 surprisingly, rVSIVs expressing Gs of the remaining tibroviruses equaled or outperformed 338 rVSIV-VSIV G control in number of cell types infected and/or infection efficiency. Most 339 notably, rVSIV-EKV-1 and rVSIV-EKV-2 entered and replicated in all tested cell lines. Only 340 two cell lines were infected with approximately \u226450% efficiency, and 44 cell lines (rVSIV-EKV-341 1) or 40 cell lines (rVSIV-EKV-2) were infected with \u2248100% efficiency (Figure 2). Importantly, 342 cell lines resistant to rVSIV-VSIV G control infection (i.e., CNS SNB-75, RXF-393) were not 343 necessarily resistant to infection with rVSIVs expressing certain tibrovirus Gs. For instance, the 344 SNB-75 cell line was efficiently infected with rVSIV-BHV (\u224880%) and rVSIV-CPV (\u224845%). 345 The cell line was inefficiently infected with rVSIV-BAV, rVSIV-EKV-1, rVSIV-EKV-2, and 346 rVSIV-TIBV and not at all infected with rVSIV-BASV and rVSIV-SWBV.

Together, these results indicate that all tibroviruses may be able 350 to broadly enter human cell types and that individual tibrovirus Gs bestow different cell tropism 351 patterns.

Previously, rVSIV particles devoid of 386 VSIV G and pseudotyped with BASV G were also confirmed to enter target cells in a pH-387 dependent manner (Steffen et al., 2013). To evaluate whether all tibrovirus Gs function 388 analogously, we chose a common cell line universally susceptible to tibrovirus G-mediated 389 particle entry (Vero cells, Figure 3A). These cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations 390 of endosomal pH modulators (lysosomotropic weak bases NH4Cl or chloroquine or vacuolar type 391 H + -ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A) for 30 min followed by exposure to rVSIV-VSIV G 392 control and all 8 rVSIVs expressing tibrovirus Gs at MOI = 0.6 in the presence of these 393 modulators for 1 h.

BHV was isolated only in porcine stable-equine 466 kidney (PS-EK) cells (Standfast et al., 1984) and in C6/36 cells after a single Vero cell passage 467 (Huang et al., 2016). CPV was isolated in BHK-21, C6/36 cells, and Vero cells (Cybinski and Gard, 468 1986). TIBV was originally isolated in suckling laboratory mice and could be grown in BHK-21 469 and Vero cells (Cybinski et al., 1980). To our knowledge, no further data on cell or animal tropism 470 of replicating tibroviruses have been reported. However, in 2013, Steffen et al. reported the 471 evaluation of BASV cell entry using an eGFP-expressing VSIV pseudotyped with BASV G 472 (Steffen et al., 2013). Using this system, the authors demonstrated that BASV G successfully 473 mediates VSIV particle entry into human B lymphocytes (B-THP), cervix (HeLa), colon 474 (SW480), and colon carcinoma (CaCo-2) cells, erythroblasts (HEL), fibrosarcoma (HT1080), 475 liver (Huh-7.5), and lung (A549) cells, and monocytes (THP-1), muscle (RD) cells, and T 476 lymphocytes (Jurkat, H9). The same pseudotype system was used to demonstrate that BASV G-477 mediated VSIV entry into adult grivet kidney (Vero), Asian tiger mosquito larva (C6/36, C7/10), 478 aurochs (Bos taurus) kidney (MDBK), BHK-21, Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) 479 lung (Tb1 Lu), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) kidney (NRK) and brain (C6) cells, domestic pig 480 (Sus scrofa) kidney (SK-RST) cells, and house mouse (Mus musculus) fibroblasts (3T3, MC57) 481 (Steffen et al., 2013). These experiments suggested that BASV particles can enter a broad range of 482 cells from diverse animal species, including Homo sapiens. This result stands in contrast to the 483 knowledge available at the time on tropism of other tibroviruses. 484 Our systematic approach sheds further light on tibrovirion cell entry abilities. Together, 485 our results indicate that all tibrovirus Gs, not only BASV G, can mediate tibrovirus particle entry 486 into a wide variety of cells derived from animals of diverse species, including Homo sapiens 487 (Figures 2, 3, and 5). The most surprising result was that EKV-1 and EKV-2, which had been 488 discovered in human sera (Stremlau et al., 2015), appeared so much more efficient in entering 489 human cells than BASV, the only other tibrovirus found in humans thus far (Grard et al.our results need to be regarded with caution. First, it is important to emphasize 492 that our data only indicate which cell lines allow entry of particles of diverse tibroviruses, but we 493 cannot state which of these tibrovirion-susceptible cells are also permissive to tibrovirus 494 replication, particle formation, and particle egress. For instance, BASV, EKV-1, and/or EKV-2 495 could possibly enter numerous human cell types in vivo but then be restricted via antiviral 496 pathways of the penetrated cells in replication and virion progeny formation. Indeed, N-detecting 497 western blots using cells infected with four authentic tibroviruses (Figure 5) suggest that most 498 cell lines are resistant to productive tibrovirus infection (absence of CPE and/or N expression) 499 with the notable exception of TIBV.

All four viruses were 177 received as lyophilized powders in individual tubes. Each powder was resuspended in 1 ml of 178 phosphate-buffer saline (PBS). 100 \u03bcl of a given suspension were added to a T75 flask 179 containing Vero or Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) larva C6/36 (ATCC, #CRL-1660) cells (see below for culture conditions). Cell supernatants were harvested when cytopathic 181 effects (CPE) affected approximately 60% of cells (designated P1; 15 ml/flask). 1 ml of P1 was used to infect a T175 flask of Vero or C6/36 cells. Supernatants were harvested when CPE affected approximately 60% of cells (designated P2; 30 ml/flask). P2 was centrifuged to remove gross debris, aliquoted, and stored at -80\u00baC until use for all tibrovirus infections performed for 185 this study.
