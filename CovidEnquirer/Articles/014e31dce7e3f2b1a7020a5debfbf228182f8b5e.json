It is important for healthcare workers to ensure the protective performance of each PPE against penetration of pathogens. The International Standards Organization (ISO) 22609 test evaluates the effectiveness of medical facemasks to protect against penetration of splashed synthetic blood. However, in this method, the protective performance is determined only visually, without quantification of leaked liquid volume. Therefore, in this study, we modified the ISO 22609 test method to quantify the volume of leaked liquid and obtain a more accurate assessment of the protection performance. We tested non-woven and woven materials used for masks or protective clothing, and the performance of each material was classified using this new method. We found that the quantity of leaked synthetic blood was dependent on the structural characteristics of each material. These findings will allow healthcare workers to select the most appropriate PPE for a given situation or task.",

These fabrics were previously tested for penetration resistance to SB according to the pressurized cell test (JIS T 8060, Fig. 1 ) 16) and grouped into specific classes according to the response to applied pressure 17) . In JIS T 8060, the loaded pressure level is divided into six stages, and the pressure is increased step-by-step at 5-min intervals. Higher-class fabrics were more resistant to pressure -i.e., of those that were woven, samples 1, 2, and 4 were in class < 1, whereas samples 3 and 5 were in class 1; and of those that were non-woven, sample 6 was in class < 1; samples 7, 8, and 9 were in class 1; sample 11 was in class 2; and sample 10 was in class 3 18) . Samples were cut into squares measuring 13 \u00d7 13 cm for testing. Testing apparatus and procedure The experimental setup of the testing apparatus based on ISO 22609 is shown in Fig. 2a . The apparatus consisted of a testing booth equipped with a splash gun, sample holder, and a splash pressure control unit. We tested woven and non-woven materials used for PPC or masks at impact pressures of 16.0 and 21.3 kPa, which were the same as those for SB in ISO 22609. We used Kimtowel paper (Nippon Paper Crecia Co., Tokyo, Japan) to absorb and easily visualize the leaked liquid. The fabric sample was placed in the sample holder along with a sheet of the absorbent paper with a diameter of 8 cm. The distance between the splash gun and sample holder was 30 cm. A 2-ml volume of SB (Synthetic Blood Reagent Mix: ISO 16603; Johnson, Moen & Co., Rochester, MN, USA) was ejected from the splash gun onto the sample, which was then removed from the holder along with the paper. The back of the sample was checked for leaked SB and the area was measured to determine leakage volume (Fig. 2b) . The test was repeated five times for each sample.",

            "text": "In this study, we evaluated the protection performance of woven and non-woven materials used in commercially available PPC or masks at hospitals to protect against leakage of splashed blood, using a modified version of the ISO 22609 test. The results are summarized in Table 2 . We found that the volume of leaked liquid was dependent on the structural characteristics of each material; samples 3, 4, 5, 10, and 11 had low leakage volumes. Detection sensitivity was improved by using absorption paper rather than by relying on simple visual inspection. In this study, an SB volume as low as 0.05 \u03bcl that penetrated sample 5 was detected using absorption paper (Fig. 3) . Our previous study demonstrated a positive correlation between leaked SB volume and number of penetrated microbes 15) . Therefore, quantifying the volume of leaked liquid is a more effective approach for evaluating the protection performance of materials used to manufacture PPC and masks against pathogens than the current method based on visual observation. For instance, HBV DNA concentration in the whole blood of infected patients was found to be 7.5 \u00d7 10 5 \u2212 4.3 \u00d7 10 8 copies/ml; 19) HBV-infected patient blood contains 37.5 \u2212 2.15 \u00d7 10 4 copies HBV DNA/0.05 \u03bcl. Thus, HCWs are at high risk of HBV infection, given that a previous study reported that the minimum amount required for transmission of HBV is approximately 30 copies in the case of chimpanzees 20) .",

This implies that protection performance is dependent on multiple factors -i.e., mainly material structure, but also load condition (splash impact and continuous pressure). Therefore, it is necessary to test materials under various conditions to determine their protective capacity. It is important for HCWs to select suitable PPC and masks certified by testing. Identifying differences in protection performance by various test methods can facilitate PPE selection based on risk assessment so that accidental exposure to infectious agents can be avoided. However, there are few methods currently available for testing the performance of protective materials against hazardous biological agents (Table 3) . These tests typically measure the Clothing for protection against contact with blood and body fluids -Determination of the resistance of protective clothing materials to penetration by blood and body fluids -Test method using synthetic blood Clothing for protection agains tinfectious agents -Medicalfacemasks-Test method for resistance against penetration by syntheticblood (fixedvolume, horizontallyprojected)",
