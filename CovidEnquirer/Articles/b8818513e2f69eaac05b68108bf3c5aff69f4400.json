All animals belonged to a herd located in the mountains of the Le6n province (NW Spain). Rotaviruses were found in 18 out of 63 goat kid fecal samples but no significant association between shedding of rotavirus and presence of diarrhea could be established. Rotaviruses were found in kids aged 6 to 21 days, and more frequently between 6 and l0 days. No shedding of virus was detected in any of the adults. Considering ELISA as the reference test, PAGE and both latex agglutination tests were less sensitive. One of the latex tests was also highly non-specific. All PAGE-positive samples showed the typical electropherotype of group A rotavirus. Feces were also screened for other pathogens including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Cryptosporidium parvum. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of six out of 45 goat kids tested, all six suffering from diarrhea. This paper represents the first description of rotavirus infections in goats in Spain. The possible mechanisms of viral diffusion within the herd and its role as pathogen in goats are discussed.",

Most animals experience infection at one stage or another throughout their lives, as evidenced by high percentages of seropositive animals found in several studies (Takahashi et al., 1979; Sato et al., 1981 ) .

While indoors, all animals were housed in the same building, but separated by wooden fences into lots depending on age and breeding status. Kid goats received three colostrum doses directly from their mothers and then were split into small groups according to birthdates, i.e., all kids that were born in the same week were kept together. Groups were separated from one another by means of hay fences and from adults by a 3-m wide corridor and by wooden or hay fences. They were fed continually on a mixture of milk from the whole herd and artificial milk. They were kept indoors until their second or third month of life, when they were put out to graze. Parturition season started at the end of January and the number of live born kids, when this study reached its conclusion, was 65.",

( 1988 ) observed that 16 out of 25 goats shedding rotavirus on the same farm were older than I month, whereas Nagy et al. (1987) limnd rotavirus excretion between 7 and 30 d of age (mean 16). This divergency in the data has also been observed for other species and suggests that many ['actors, such as the immune status of the herd, may influence age of rotavirus infection. Rotavirus was detected in feces from 6 d of age and onwards. Incubation period for the rotavirus infection is usually between 24 and 72 h, and although it is generally admitted that in a herd where rotavirus infection is enzootic most animals get infected on their d 1, excretion is not usually detected in feces until d 4-5 or even much later due to the presence of co]ostral antibodies in the gut. These passively acquired antibodies may have contributed to prevent the development of more sevcrc symptoms in this herd and could also explain the fact that rotavirus was not detected in animals below 6 d of age, as kids were continually fed on maternal colostrum and milk, and does were known to possess specific antibodies (data not shown) that might pass to the gut of the newborn resulting in an increase ol' the incubation period or even in the prevention of infection.",

Studies that have been carried out in other species, such as bovine and porcine, have led to heterogeneous results, with some authors demonstrating excretion of virus in mother's feces (Rubio et al., 1989; Kodituwakku and Harbour, 1990 ) and others not (Fu and Hampson, 1989: Garcfa-Sanchez et al., 1993) . It is believed that cows may shed virus intermittently o~ in such low amounts that can not be detected by the commonly used diagnostic tests but that are enough to perpetuate the infection in a herd by infecting their offspring. Nevertheless, they would not be the main source of infection, but the other calves that excrete virus in high concentrations contributing to progressive contamination of soil and hay.

Latex agglutination tests are even less sensitive late in the course of diarrhea (Miotti et al., 1985) , when low quantities of virus are shed. The same occurs for detection of asymptomatic animals excreting rotavirus, which was the case for most of the goat kids tested. Rotalex has its beads coated with polyclonal antibodies against a bovine G6 serotype strain (NCDV) ( Sukura and Neuvonen, 1990) . Sanekata et al. ( 1991 ) observed a higher sensitivity of a latex test using antibodies anti-OSU strain in detecting the homologous virus than in detecting viruses of other serotypes such a G 1, G3 and G6. In agreement, Goyal et al. (1987) found that Rotalex was more sensitive in the detection of bovine rotavirus than in the detection of rotaviruses from pigs and turkeys. Molyneaux et al.

However, it only detected ten out of 18 positive samples, probably because the test was performed from the suspension liquid of rectal swabs instead of feces, and thus, the sample quantity was lower. Furthermore, PAGE has been compared with other techniques for detection of rotavirus in diarrheic rather than in asymptomatic animals, in which the sensitivity could be lower because of the smaller amount of virus excreted, as shown by the faint RNA bands observed in the positive samples. In fact, PAGE detected all three ELISA-positive samples from diarrheic kids.",

Latex tests are easy and quick to perform and do not need to be automated, but it must be taken into account that some commercial kits can not be suitable to use in goat species as shown in this study, and may have a lower sensitivity when detecting rotavirus from asymptomatic animals. PAGE has a higher sensitivity and the advantage that detects non-group A rotaviruses, but both special equipment and trained personnel are needed. ELISA seems to be a sensitive technique when detection of rotavirus has to be done in asymptomatic animals, but also needs special equipment. This paper represents the first description of the presence of rotavirus infections in goats in Spain.",
