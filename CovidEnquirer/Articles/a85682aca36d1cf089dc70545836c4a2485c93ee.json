Restrictions due to notifiable epizootics complicate the exchange of samples in surveillance studies and suggest that laboratory capacities should be established domestically. Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) causes mainly enteric disease in cattle. Spillover to small ruminants is possible. Here we established BCoV serology based on a recombinant immunofluorescence assay for cattle, goats and sheep, and studied the seroprevalence of BCoV in these species in four different locations in the Greater Accra, Volta, Upper East, and Northern provinces of Ghana. The whole sampling and testing was organized and conducted by a veterinary school in Kumasi, Ashanti Region of Ghana. Among sampled sheep (n = 102), goats (n = 66), and cattle (n = 1495), the seroprevalence rates were 25.8 %, 43.1 % and 55.8 %. For cattle, seroprevalence was significantly higher on larger farms (82.2 % vs 17.8 %, comparing farms with > 50 or < 50 animals; p = 0.027). Highest prevalence was seen in the Northern province with dry climate, but no significant trend following the north-south gradient of sampling sites was detected. Our study identifies a considerable seroprevalence for BCoV in Ghana and provides further support for the spillover of BCoV to small ruminants in settings with mixed husbandry and limited separation between species.",

The present numbers in 2017 based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) animal production database are estimated to range around 1.76, 6.4, and 4.6 million cattle, goats and sheep in the country, respectively. Among livestock, only chicken outnumber these species (74 million). While disease surveillance is in place, there are knowledge gaps concerning the laboratory-based prevalence of some major livestock diseases. Among these is Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) that affects cattle and other livestock species including horses and camels.",

While different strains may have some antigenic variability, all strains elicit cross-reactive seropositivity and thus form a single serotype (Clark, 1993; El-Ghorr et al., 1989) . The virus is an important livestock pathogen causing effects on animal welfare as well as the economy (Lathrop et al., 2000a) . It causes diarrhea and respiratory disease in calves, as well as winter dysentery in adult cattle (Boileau and Kapil, 2010; Ksiazek et al., 2003) . Transmission of BCoV is mainly through respiratory or fecal-oral routes (Clark, 1993) , infecting the respiratory (nasal, tracheal, and lung) and intestinal (villi and crypts of the ileum and colon) epithelial cells (Park et al., 2007) . When infected with BCoV, within-herd transmission is generally rapid and infected animals display diverse clinical signs including diarrhea with or without blood, fever, and respiratory signs, which range from none to severe (Clark, 1993; Boileau and Kapil, 2010) . In many African countries including Ghana, livestock species live in close contact and animals serve diverse purposes such as transportation, draught power, fuel, clothing and as a source of meat and milk. Husbandry practices do not involve the same standards of species separation and hygiene as in other parts of the world. Close and sustained interaction between different animals as well as between animals and humans pose a risk of interspecies spillover of pathogens.",

Briefly, Vero B4 cells were co-transfected with pCG1 plasmids bearing Human coronavirus OC43 spike proteins. After overnight transfection, cells were harvested by treatment with trypsin to detach them in a cell culture incubator at 37\u00b0C and re-suspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, USA) in 10 % Foetal Calf Serum (FCS). Aliquots of cells were pelleted at 300 x g for 5 min and washed twice with 1 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Fifty microliters (50 \u03bcl) of cell pellets were spotted on 12 well slides by dispensing and immediately aspirating, allowing 2 s interval between spotting. The cells were fixed using ice cold acetone/methanol (1:1), dried at ambient temperature, and kept at 4\u00b0C after drying for 20 min. To conduct the assay, 45 \u03bcl of protein-free blocking solution (Roti\u00ae-Block, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) was first added to each of the 12 spotted fields on the slide and incubated at room temperature in a humid box for 30 min, followed by rinsing with 1X tween-free PBS. After inactivation at 56\u00b0C for 30 min, sera to be tested were diluted 1:100 in a 1X concentration of the protein-free blocking solution. Subsequently, 30 \u03bcl of the diluted sera was applied on each of the spotted area and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in a humid chamber, followed by rinsing with 0.1 % tween in 1X PBS.

            "text": "BCoV is a ubiquitous infection and BCoV-specific antibodies have been detected in cattle populations in numerous countries (Hasoksuz et al., 2002; Kapil et al., 1990; Lathrop et al., 2000b; Yavru et al., 2016) . BCoV shares recent common ancestry with human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) (Vijgen et al., 2006) and the two are serologically closely related to the extent that HCoV-OC43 is often used as a proxy in serological testing as previously described where specific proteins of BCoV were not available for serological testing or when National legislation restricts the use of certain livestock pathogens (Reusken et al., 2013b; Meyer et al., 2014) . In most African countries such as Ghana, diverse farm animals live in close contact that poses a risk of cross-species infection. Indeed, we found seropositivity against BCoV not only among cattle (55.8 %) but also among sheep and goats at 25.8 % and 43.1 % prevalence rates, respectively. This prevalence was predominant among Ontario feedlots, respectively based on enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Bidokhti et al. (2009); Hasoksuz et al. (2005) , and Yildirim et al. (2008) also reported a sero-prevalence of 82-86 %, 54.5 %, and 26.3 %, respectively among cattle. The discrepancies in the prevalence rates compared to that of this present study could be attributed, at least in part, to differences in geographical location, different management systems, source population size, method employed for BCoV antibody detection, and the samples size used in the different investigations. In addition, the higher prevalence rate among cattle could be due to the fact that a higher proportion of the animals were cattle as well as the tropism of BCoV to cattle Few studies have been conducted to evaluate the prevalence of BCoV among small ruminants. The most recent study was conducted by Gumusova et al. in 2007 in Turkey. In their study, they evaluated the sero-prevalence of BCoV in goats by employing commercially available competitive ELISA kits and reported a BCoV sero-prevalence of 41.1 % (Gumusova et al., 2007) . In a previous study, Eisa and Mohamed reported detection of BCoV antigens in goats (Eisa and Mohamed, 2004) . Additionally, Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., in a study among 218 sheep from 40 flocks in different parts of Sweden, reported that 19 % of the sheep were positive for BCoV antibodies (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1999) . Prior to these recent studies, there had been reports of BCoV infection in small ruminants in Australia (Pass et al., 1982) , New Zealand (Durham et al., 1979) , Chile (Reinhardt et al., 1995) , and Scotland (Snodgrass et al., 1980) . Our finding in sheep and goats, thus, provides update information of spillover of BCoV from cattle.",

Though there was no statistically significant association between the possible risks factors assessed and BCoV sero-positivity, we found BCoV sero-positivity to be significantly associated with farms with higher cattle density. This finding is in harmony with studies by Beaudeau et al. (2010) ; H\u00e4gglund et al. (2006) , and Ohlson et al. (2010) who reported that large herd size is a risk factor for BCoV infections in dairy cattle. This may be due to poor biosecurity especially among farms with larger herd size in Ghana, and also due to the close contact between animals in these farms which could potentiate the transmission of BCoV compared to farms with small herd size (Beaudeau et al., 2010; Ohlson et al., 2010) .",
