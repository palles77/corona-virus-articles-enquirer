These transgenic mice were susceptible to infection by the 263K strain of hamster scrapie with an average incubation period of 93 days, compared to 72 days in normal hamsters. In contrast, nontransgenic mice were not susceptible to this agent. These results indicate that neuron-specific expression of the 1 kb HPrP minigene including the HPrP open-reading frame is sufficient to mediate susceptibility to hamster scrapie, and that HPrP expression in nonneuronal brain cells is not necessary to overcome the TSE species barrier.",

            "text": "Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are degenerative brain diseases that occur naturally in primates and ruminants, and include scrapie of sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and several human diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Kuru, and Gerstmann-Str~.ussler-Scheinker syndrome. An important feature of TSE diseases is the accumulation in brain of a proteinase K-resistant protein, known as PrP-res or PrP s\u00b0, which appears to be strongly associated with the pathogenic process (Bolton et al., 1982; Prusiner, 1982; Diringer et al., 1983) . PrP-res is posttranslationally derived from a normal host proteinase K-sensitive PrP molecule (PrP-sen; Borchelt et al., 1990; Caughey and Raymond, 1991; Stahl et al., 1993) by an as yet undefined mechanism. Brain preparations highly enriched for scrapie infectivity contain large amounts of PrP-res, but no scrapie-specific nucleic acid has been detected (Alper et al., 1978; Hunter, 1979; Latarjet, 1979; Dees et al., 1985; Bellinger-Kawahara et al., 1987) . As a result, it has been suggested that PrP-res is the etiologic agent of TSE (Prusiner, 1982) . Although the precise nature of the causative agent remains unresolved, several studies have established an important role for PrP in TSE pathogenesis. For example, there is a close linkage between the PrP gene and a gene controlling the length of the scrapie incubation period in mice and sheep (Carlson et al., 1988; Hunter et al., 1989; Race et al., 1990) . Also, mutations in the human PrP gene are associated with occurrence of familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Str&ussler-Scheinker syndrome, and Fatal Familial Insomnia (Doh-ura et al., 1989; Hsiao et al., 1989 Hsiao et al., , 1991a Hsiao et al., , 1991b Goldgaber et al., 1989; Goldfarb et al., 1990) . In addition, PrP null mice devoid of PrP-sen are resistant to experimental scrapie, indicating that expression of PrP-sen is an absolute requirement for scrapie agent replication and disease induction (Bueler et al., 1993) .",

This resistance or \"species barrier\" is manifested either by total lack of disease induction or by a prolonged incubation period prior to onset of clinical disease. For instance, Chandler mouse scrapie can be transmitted to Syrian hamsters with an average incubation period of 378 days, but in mice the incubation period is 120 days (Kimberlin and Walker, 1978; Kimberlin et al., 1987) . Conversely, the 263K hamster scrapie strain has a 72 day incubation period in Syrian hamsters, but does not cause clinical disease in mice. Of particular concern is whether or not various strains of TSE in animals can be transmitted to humans. Epidemiological studies indicate that transmission from scrapie-infected sheep to humans does not occur. However, the recent epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Great Britain has raised worries that this apparently new strain of TSE might be infectious to humans.",

Transgenic mice with a 40 kb transgene expressing high levels of hamster PrP (HPrP)-sen are susceptible to disease when inoculated with the hamster scrapie agent, while normal mice are resistant (Scott et al., 1989; Prusiner et al., 1990) . This suggests that transmission of scrapie may be dependent on interactions between the host PrP-sen and the PrP-res associated with the inoculated agent. The importance of direct PrP-sen-PrP-res interactions in PrP-res formation has now been documented in cell-free reactions (Kocisko et al., 1994 (Kocisko et al., , 1995 . Furthermore, interactions between PrP molecules from different species have been found to inhibit generation of PrP-res in both scrapie-infected cells and in cell-free systems (Kocisko et al., 1994 (Kocisko et al., , 1995 , and such inhibitory interactions may provide a biochemical explanation for the species barrier.",

            "text": "The normal PrP-sen precursor of PrP-res appears to be expressed in a wide variety of cells and tissues (Oesch et al., 1985; Caughey et al., 1988; Brown et al., 1990) , and it is unclear which of these sites might be involved in the possible effect of PrP on TSE agent replication and PrP-res formation following interspecies transmission. TSE agents are known to replicate in both lymphoreticular organs and brain, but the precise cell types involved are not known. PrP-sen expression has recently been demonstrated in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Moser et al., 1995) , and astrocytes have been found to be the earliest site of PrP-res accumulation in the brain (Diedrich et al., 1991) . Together, these results argue for the direct involvement of gila in scrapie agent propagation. However, in mouse and hamster brain, high levels of PrP mRNA and PrP-sen protein have also been detected in neurons (Kretzschmar et al., 1986; Brown et al., 1990; Manson et al., 1992 Manson et al., , 1994 . Therefore, it is unclear whether PrP expression in both neurons and astrocytes is critical to PrP-res formation. In the present work, we show that transgenic mice expressing the hamster PrP (HPrP) gene under control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter (Forss-Petter et al., 1990) are highly susceptible to the hamster scrapie agent. In these mice, HPrP expression was found exclusively in neurons and not in glial cells or cells within the spleen or lymph nodes. Thus, neuronspecific hamster PrP expression was sufficient to abrogate the TSE species barrier, and hamster PrP expression in lymphoreticular tissues or nonneuronal brain cells including astrocytes was not required to overcome resistance of mice to the hamster scrapie agent. Furthermore, because the transgene used in these experiments contained only I kb of hamster DNA including the open reading frame of hamster PrP, the present results demonstrate that susceptibility of these transgenic mice to hamster scrapie is mediated by the hamster PrP gene itself rather than the additional 39 kb of transgene DNA used in previous studies (Scott et al., 1989; Prusiner et al., 1990; Westaway et al., 1994) .",

The Tg52NSE line was derived by inoculation of a construct containing the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promotor plus a 1 kb cDNA containing the HPrP open reading frame ( Figure 1A) . A second HPrP transgenic line, Tgl0, was generated with a cosmid vector containing the HPrP gene plus 40 kb of flanking DNA (Scott et al., 1989) . Previously, this cosmid was used to generate another line of transgenic mice susceptible to hamster scrapie (Scott et al., 1989) . Following production of transgenic mice by standard techniques, positive founder mice were bred to nontransgenic C57BL/10 mice, and the transgene was maintained in heterozygous form Figure 1A . Structure of NSE-HPrP Transgene and Predicted mRNA (A) 1.0 kb fragment of the hamster PrP (HPrP) cDNA (Robakis et al., 1986a (Robakis et al., , 1986b containing the 762 bp open reading frame (boxed) was cloned into the Hindlll site of pNSE-Ex 4, which was generated and provided by Dr. Sonja Forss-Petter, Scripps Research Institute, from a previously described genomic clone of the rat NSE gene (Forss-Petter et al., 1990; Mucke et al., 1994) . pNSE-Ex 4 contains 2.8 kb of rat NSE flanking sequences upstream of the transcriptional start of exon 1,54 bp of exon I, a 1.2 kb intron, and 6 bp of exon 2 upstream of the unique Hindlll cloning site. Downstream of the Hindlll site is a 1 kb fragment of SV40 sequence used as a molecular tag for transgenic RNA in in situ hybridization studies. The poly A signal is located in the middle of the SV40 DNA. The transgene DNA was excised from the bacterial plasmid vector, pUC 19, by digestion with Sail, and the large Sail fragment shown was purified and used for inoculation of mouse cells for generation of transgenic mice. (B) Expression of HPrP mRNA in transgenic mouse brain. Polyadenylated RNA (2 pg) extracted from brain of a normal nontransgenic mouse, a Tg52NSE, or a Tgl0 mouse was separated on an agarose/ formaldehyde gel, blotted, and hybridized to a 32P-labeled DNA probe derived from HPrP. Under the conditions used, this probe hybridizes to RNA derived from either mouse PrP (MPrP) or HPrP. The 2.3 kb mRNA common to all three lanes represents MPrP mRNA derived from the endogenous MPrP gene. The HPrP mRNA derived from TglO brain is also present at 2.3 kb. The unique 1.6 kb mRNA band in the Tg52NSE lane is derived from the NSE-HPrP construct and is the size expected for the fully spliced transcript. (C) Western blot detection of HPrP-sen in tissues from a Tg52NSE mouse, a Tgl0 mouse, and a normal hamster. Suspensions of various tissues were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon nylon membranes and immunoblots performed using antibody 3F4, which recognizes hamster PrP but not mouse PrP. Blots were developed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence reagent system (Amersham). Immunoreactive bands shown represent HPrP-sen. HPrP-sen was detected in all of the indicated tissues from Tgl0 mice. In Tg52NSE mice, HPrP-sen was detected only in brain. Normal hamsters had HPrP-sen in brain, heart, lung, and thymus but not in muscle or spleen. Hamster testes were not assayed.",

HPrP mRNA was detected in a variety of neuronal populations of the brain. Highest expression was seen in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, neurons of the dentate gyrus, and pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus ( Figure  2 ). Granular layer neurons of the cerebellum, cells in various layers of the cerebral cortex, and cells with large nuclei in the dorsal portion of the thalamus also expressed moderate amounts of HPrP mRNA (Figure 2 ). These results were consistent with neuron-specific expression of the HPrP transgene in Tg52NSE mice. Further confirmation of neuronal expression of the HPrP transgene was achieved using primary hippocampal neuron cultures and astrocyte cultures. Using monoclonal antibody 3F4, greater than 90% of neurons from Tg52NSE mice had detectable HPrP protein after in vitro culture for 48 hr. This was observed in 3 out of 5 experiments. In contrast, astrocytes cultured from these same mice never expressed detectable HPrP (data not shown).",

Tgl0 mice, on the other hand, had a more variable and protracted clinical course lasting several weeks or even months and died between 80 and 405 days postinoculation (Figure 3 ). The clinical symptoms in Tgl0 mice included whole-body tremors, ataxia, and progression to paralysis and death (Table 1 ). In hamsters, clinical symptoms included ataxia, tremor, and somnolence (Table 1) . Clinically ill Tg52NSE mice and Tgl0 mice had easily detectable proteinase K-resistant HPrP and histopathological findings typical of scrapie with astrocytosis and spongiosis (data not shown). Furthermore, brain homogenates from hamster scrapie-infected Tg52NSE and Tgl0 mice caused scrapie on reinoculation in hamsters, but not in mice (data not shown).

Furthermore, earlier attempts to produce transgenic mice using only the HPrP open reading frame were not successful (Scott et al., 1989 ). In contrast, the present experiments succeeded in getting high levels of HPrP expression by using a transgene containing only 1 kb of hamster DNA including the 762 base pair open reading frame of HPrP together with the neuron-specific enolase promoter.

However, this is highly unlikely since several transgenic mouse lines expressing HPrP with the PrP promoter have been studied (see Figure 3 ) (Scott et al., 1989; Prusiner et al., 1990) , and in all cases HPrP expression level correlates with susceptibility to hamster scrapie.

However, based on the present findings, HPrP expression in astrocytes or FDC was not required to mediate susceptibility of mice to intracerebral inoculation with hamster scrapie. Nevertheless, in addition to neurons, HPrP expression in cells such as astrocytes, FDC, or even other cell types might also be sufficient to overcome the scrapie species barrier, and FDC in spleen and lymph nodes m ight be particularly involved in interspecies transmission following intraperitoneal inoculation of agent.",

For example, incubation of mouse PrP-res with hamster PrP-sen or mouse PrP-sen resulted in generation of protease-resistant products with differing subunit molecular weights (Kocisko et al., 1995) . This suggested that the biochemical structures of the intact protease-resistant PrP forms were not identical when PrP-sen from different species were used. Such structural differences might be involved in the speciesspecific adaptation that often occurs following interspecies transmission of TSE agents.",

In mouse neuroblastoma cells infected with mouse scrapie, the expression of hamster PrP interfered with generation of mouse PrP-res , and by analogy similar interactions may also be capable of blocking exogenous infection by the hamster scrapie agent in these cell lines. Although in the present experiments inhibitory effects of HPrP expression on infection of Tg52NSE mice with mouse scrapie resulted in a significantly increased incubation period, all mice eventually developed clinical disease. In the converse experiment of infection of Tg52NSE by hamster scrapie agent, the incubation period was longer than in normal hamster (Table  1) , but again all mice were susceptible. At present, we have no adequate explanation for the differences in interspecies infection experiments between in vitro mouse neuroblastoma cell lines and transgenic mice in vivo; however, one important factor might be that the mice are 100,000fold more sensitive to scrapie infection than are mouse neuroblastoma cells Race and Ernst, 1992) .",

Such factors might include foreign PrP molecules and cellular glycosaminoglycans, both of which have been noted to influence the biochemistry of PrP-res generation in vitro (Caughey and Raymond, 1993; Caughey et al., 1994; Priola et al., 1994) .

Briefly, a 3sS-labeled single-stranded RNA probe specific for the SV40 sequence was used to detect expression in sections of brain. Two hundred seventeen bases of SV40 sequence were cloned into the pSP70 plasmid (Promega). The plasmid was linearized by Bglll digestion, and a product complementary to the SV40 mRNA was transcribed by the Sp6 polymerase. The quantity of probe generated was calculated by measuring the percentage incorporation of the radioisotope. Paraffin-embedded sections from saline-perfused tissue fixed in Bouins or 10% formalin were deparaffinized by washing twice for 5 min in xylene and twice for 5 min in 100% ethanol. The sections were treated, hybridized, and developed as described (Borrow et al., 1995) , with the exception that the hybridization temperature was 55\u00b0C.",

Briefly, brains were removed, and cells were mechanically dissociated and cultured on poly-L-lysine-coated culture flasks. Two days after culturing, the cells were extensively washed to remove debris and shaken overnight at 100 rpm to remove nonastroglial cells (microglia). The cultures were then trypsinized and plated onto glass cover slips for immunostaining. Primary hippocampal neurons were plated as described (Pasick et al., 1994) . Briefly, hippocampi were dissected from the brains of embryos 15-17 clays old, trypsinized and triturated, and cultured on poly-L-lysine-coated glass cover slips at a density of 500 cells/mm 2. Of these cells, 92%-95% are routinely positive for MAP2, a neuronal marker. For immunostaining, cultures were exposed to a 1:200 dilution of MAb 3F4 ascites fluid for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C. After gentle washing, cells were fixed in 50% acetone/50% methanol for 10 min, then washed extensively with buffer and reacted with biotinylated antimouse secondary antibody (Mouse Elite, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, VT). Following a 1 hr incubation with secondary antibody, the cells were washed, reacted with the avidin-biotin reagent, and incubated with hydrogen peroxide plus diaminobenzidene chromogen, resulting in a brown precipitate over positive cells.",
