Recent outbreaks of infectious disease such as Ebola Virus Disease and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) demonstrated the need for effective collaboration among countries responding to stop rapid transmission of such diseases [1, 2] . There are several mechanisms and initiatives to facilitate international cooperation to address such crises. The International Health Regulations (IHR), which entered into force in 2007 and are led by the World Health Organization (WHO), requires countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to WHO. These reporting requirements help the international community prevent and respond to public health emergencies that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide [3] . The U.S. is also leading an international effort to integrate its biodefense strategy for preempting an outbreak and has committed to partner with other countries in order to achieve the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) goal of preventing, detecting, and responding to infectious disease threats [4] .",

An AR Biological Defense Task Force (BDTF) was established in 2012 to prioritize, track, and implement approved recommendations captured in After Action Reports from each AR exercise. In the past several years, the AR Initiative has increased awareness and improved coordination activities between the U.S. and ROK and, more importantly, across the ROK government and defense agencies.

During August 2014, military and civilian government officials, and the staff of a number of agencies from both ROK and U.S. participated in the AR14.

The AR exercises provide an opportunity to examine issues related to existing policies and plans and multilateral cooperation during a bio-crisis. The mission of the AR exercise series is to improve the combined ROK-U.S. ability to prepare for and respond to a naturally occurring or intentional bio-event through a 'whole-of-government' approach. Eliciting responses from ROK and U.S. military, civilian, and interagency partners from both countries, the AR14 exercise, was conducted on August 11-14, 2014, and simulated approximately 15 days in the exercise scenario involving multiple events. A pre-scripted master scenario events list (MSEL) was used to prompt exercise players to react to each scenario event using their existing agency response procedures in a manner similar to an actual incident. The scenario and MSEL were used to facilitate identifying strengths and limitations in addressing the participating agencies mission. Most exercise players participated from their normal work sites via the Biosurveillance Portal (BSP).",

This trust may be affected by perception on the competence, objectivity, fairness, and consistency of the responding agency and highly depend on the general belief in the good will of the agency [9] . Risk communication during a biological event should closely involve the affected community through clear messaging. Individualized approaches are needed to ensure that the customized messages are delivered appropriately to diverse populations [10, 11] . In an era when the public has far-reaching access to social media mostly via smart phones, governments will be challenged to provide accurate, timely information to the public before inaccurate information and rumors become widespread.
