A Western blot technique was also used on the positive sera in order to confirm the presence of specific antibodies to FIV. The Western blot enabled the detection of a false positive serum. The prevalence of FIV infection in this population was 12.5% and among the seropositive cats a greater proportion was male (74.5%) than female (25.5%). A correlation between the clinical status and the evolution of the pathology is described together with a score based on the severity of the stomatitis in infected cats. The Western blot patterns of positive samples were then compared with the stage of the pathology. Statistical analysis on the distribution of FIV in stray cats, cats with garden and courtyard access and strictly house-confined cats showed a highly significant risk of the infection in the first group.",

The mean age of the seropositive cats classifed in the AC group was 2.6 years while it was 5.8 years in the ARC group. This gap supports the hypothesis that a relatively long time lapse is required before the clinical signs develop. The division of the disease into stages represents a useful tool for the practitioner, since the survival time of a cat can be estimated and potential therapy against the opportunistic infections evaluated. In the field situation, it is relatively difficult to evaluate at which clinical stage a FIV positive cat can be classified, in particular regarding the acute phase, where there are no indications of when a cat aOne of these cats was also FeLV positive. became infected . In this work it has been possible to determine this data by performing the screening test on previously healthy cats that showed a sudden illness. Many of these cats had been regularly taken to the practitioner and thus had a known remote anamnesis. Furthermore, in subsequent visits the same cats were shown to have recovered completely. Hence it was possible to be certain that the cats were in the acute phase of the infection when screened.",

The score based on the oral cavity lesions that is proposed in this work facilitates the identification of the severity of the stomatitis (Table 4 ). By using this score it would be easier to collect the data during the clinical examination thus facilitating the subsequent analyses. In this survey it was observed that only 9% of cats with FIV infection showed fever. This is in contrast with the findings ofLutz et al. (1990) . Since many of the cats analyzed were visited by practitioners who referred the clinical status to the authors, it is possible that in some of the cats the temperature had not been taken.

            "text": "The analysis of the risk estimates by logistic regression showed some interesting findings. Domestic breeds have a higher risk than purebreeds of being positive to FIV. Whether the purebreeds have a genetic resistance to the FIV infection is, however, difficult to evaluate; besides, purebreeds are probably looked after better, which may influence the prevalence of FIV. Another survey taking into account a larger number of purebreeds could confirm an eventual genetic resistance. Male cats have a risk four times higher (Table 6 ) than female, but it is independent from the integrity of reproductive apparatus. Moreover, the absence of risk in house-kept cats with courtyard access seems to prove that the sexual transmission should be negligible. The highest risk of being positive is in the stray cats, but in this case the probability of being infected is easily explained. Agressivity, territorial defence and fighting over females are very common habits in the life of stray cats. Considering the most likely natural transmission of FIV among cats through bites involving infected saliva (Yamamoto et at., 1988; Pedersen, 1990) , the higher level of infection in these groups was as anticipated. In the whole cat population examined it was observed that 19% of stray cats were FIV seropositive, as op- posed to 5% of house-confined cats. It is interesting to notice that, even if the disease has a long incubation period, in this survey, by far the highest risk of infection is in the first 5 years of life, while after this period the risk of being infected is very low. There is a striking similarity between FIV and HIV, since also in the feline AIDS a very important role is played by the risk of exposure of the cat to FIV, allowing the identification of category of cats at more risk of infection. Since FIV, along with all the other members of the lentivirus genus, has a very low survival rate outside the organism (Narayan, 1990) , transmission is therefore the Achilles' heel in the biology of lentiviruses. Retrospective surveys on FIV have enabled the indentification of seropositive sera as far back as stored sera are available (Gruffyd-Jones et al., 1988; Sabine et al., 1988; Shelton et al., 1990) , suggesting that FIV has existed in the cat population for hundreds of years (Pedersen, 1990) .",
