However, it is not known whether SARS-CoV N protein can induce a long persistence of memory T-cell response in human. In this study, we found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from fully recovered SARS individuals rapidly produced IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 following stimulation with a pool of overlapping peptides that cover the entire N protein sequence. The N-specific IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + T cells were mainly composed of CD45RA \u2212 CCR7 + CD62L \u2212 cells, whereas IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 + memory T cells were mostly contained within CD45RA + CCR7 \u2212 CD62L \u2212 cell population. Epitope mapping study indicated that a cluster of overlapping peptides located in the C-terminal region (amino acids [aa] 331 to 362) of N protein contained at least two different T-cell epitopes. The results indicated that human memory T-cell responses specific for SARS-CoV N protein could persist for 2 years in the absence of antigen, which would be a valuable for the design of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV and for basic studies of human T-cell memory.",

More than 8400 individuals were infected, and 800 of them died in approximately 7 months over 30 countries. The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified as a new type of coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Falsey and Walsh, 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Tsang et al., 2003) . Although the first SARS epidemic has been successfully controlled, SARS still remains a potential threat to humans because the pathogenesis of SARS is not well understood and no effective approaches to prevent and treat the disease are developed.",

            "text": "As we know, SARS-CoV is a positive-sense RNA virus and the virion consists of a nucleocapsid core surrounded by an envelope containing three membrane proteins, spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) (Marra et al., 2003; Tan et al., 2004) . The N protein of CoV is a structural component of the helical nucleocapsid and plays an important role in viral pathogenesis, replication and RNA packaging (Hiscox et al., 2001; Narayanan et al., 2003) . Furthermore, this protein is more conserved than other proteins of the virus, such as spike and membrane glycoproteins. Among all the coronavirus proteins, the N protein is the most abundant throughout infection at both mRNA and protein levels (Hiscox et al., 2001) . Previous studies have shown that the N protein is one of the immunodominant antigens in the CoV family (Boots et al., 1992; Stohlman et al., 1994; Wesseling et al., 1993) . In addition, it has been proved Virology 351 (2006) 466 -475 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro that cellular immune response against N protein of some animal coronavirus can generate protective effects (Collisson et al., 2000; Stohlman et al., 1995) . Recently, several studies in animals demonstrated that the SARS-CoV N could induce specific T-cell responses (Gao et al., 2003; Jin et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2004 , Zhu et al., 2004 , as have been observed with other coronaviruses. Therefore, N protein may be an important target for SARS vaccine. Evidence suggests that the most effective prevention method against a pathogen is vaccination. Immunological memory is the basis of vaccination. At present, most studies of immune memory after SARS-CoV infection focused on memory B cells. It is clear that antibody responses specific to SARS-CoV has been observed in all of SARS patients and can last up to 540 days after the onset of symptoms (Mo et al., 2005) . However, little is known about the memory T lymphocyte responses in human SARS-CoV infection.",

The culture supernatants were collected for detection of IFN-\u03b3 by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1A , although the level of IFN-\u03b3 varied from donor to donor (ranged from 54 to 230 pg/ml), all of SARSrecovered donors were capable of producing IFN-\u03b3 in response to N peptides. However, the levels of IFN-\u03b3in normal individuals were less than 25 pg/ml. Next, we determined the frequency of N-protein-specific T cells by using IFN-\u03b3 ELIspot assay. Fig. 1B showed that the PBMCs from all of the 11 SARS-recovered individuals tested displayed significantly higher frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells than those from normal donors after stimulation with a pool of N peptides. The frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells from SARS-recovered individuals was at 63 SFC/million PBMCs, with a range of 10-178 SFC/million PBMCs. It is also noticed that there was no obvious difference in the frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells of the SARS donors and normal controls when PBMCs were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the N protein of SARS-CoV was highly immunogenic and N-protein-specific T-cell responses could persist at least for 2 years after SARS-CoV infection.",

The results showed that most of IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + T cells expressed CCR7 (71.4-91.3%) but did not express CD45RA (73.7-92%) and CD62L (75-76.6%).

The results showed that PBMCs from all of five SARS-recovered individuals had specific T-cell responses to one or more peptide pools based on the production of IFN-\u03b3. But the hierarchy of epitope recognition varied from donor to donor. As shown in Fig. 5A , 100% and 60% of the donors responded to pool V and pool IV corresponding to the sequences of amino acid (aa) residues 293-376 and 219-302 respectively, whereas frequencies of other pools were below 50%. Similar results were also confirmed by the detection of IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells using ELIspot assay (Fig. 5B) . The results showed that all of four SARS donors responded to pool V and the frequency of IFN-\u03b3producing T cells in response to pool V was the highest among six peptide pools. This result suggested that the pool V contained major immunodominant epitopes corresponding to the sequences of residues 293-376 in N protein.

There is no evidence of persistent SARS-CoV infection, and clinical reinfections with SARS-CoV have never been reported. Viral RNA can be easily detected within the first 14 days of symptomatic SARS-CoV infection, but convalescent samples (50 days after the onset of symptoms) are consistently PCR negative . Therefore, the maintenance of Nprotein-specific T-cell memory in vivo appears to be antigenindependent.",

On one hand, periodic reexposure to the pathogen which serves as a natural \"booster\" to the immune system is an effective way to maintain high levels of immunity though such reinfections are usually asymptomatic or only produce mild clinical symptoms. On the other hand, it has been already clear that memory CD4 + T cells and memory CD8 + T cells could persist in the absence of antigen in mice (Murali-Krishna et al., 1999; Lau et al., 1994) . Furthermore, memory CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells could be maintained for decades after smallpox vaccination in human (Hammarlund et al., 2003) . Since vaccinia virus does not cause a chronic infection in humans and re-exposure to the virus is unlikely, the maintenance of T-cell memory in this system also appears to be antigen-independent. Therefore, both antigen-dependent and antigen-independent mechanisms should be involved in sustaining immunological memory.",

In these two subsets, CCR7\u2212 effector memory T cells (T EM cells) would be present in the blood, spleen and nonlymphoid tissues, whereas CCR7 + central memory T cells (T CM cells) would be present in lymphoid, spleen and blood but not in nonlymphoid tissues. Recent studies of both in mice and humans have demonstrated that both cell subsets can rapidly produce IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 but that IL-2 production remains a property of T EM cells following stimulation with cognate antigen (Harari et al., 2005; Lier et al., 2003; Wherry and Ahmed, 2004; Wills et al., 2002) . Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells from SARS-recovered donors rapidly produced IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 following a short-term stimulation with N peptides. IL-2-secreting CD4 + memory T cells were more than those of CD8 + memory T cells. Phenotypic analysis suggested that a higher proportion of IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 + T cells were CD45RA + CCR7 \u2212 compared with those of IFN\u03b3 + CD4 + T cells. These larger numbers of IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 + T cells were T EM cells and produced less IL-2 compared with those of IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + T cells. Similar observations were also obtained in CMV infection in which reactive CD8 + T cells expressed CD45RA during recovery (Wills et al., 2002) and a larger number of IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 + T cells were CD45RA + CCR7 \u2212 compared with those of IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + T cells (Seder and Ahmed, 2003) .",

The clear difference in protein recognition among SARS-CoV immune donors suggests that the nature and composition of the immune response against the virus vary between individuals possibly due to the difference in HLA types. Although the results showed that the T-cell epitopes were scattered throughout the sequence of N protein, some peptides were recognized more frequently than others. The peptides that were frequently recognized by T cells were N46 (aa 331 to 347), N47 (aa 339 to 354) and N48 (aa 346 to 362). Therefore, a cluster of peptides corresponding to aa 331 to 362 were the major dominant antigenic site on N protein and contained at least two different T-cell epitopes (N46 and N48). IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells specific to these two epitopes were from 25.7% to 65% of total N-protein-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells in four SARS donors based on ELIspot assays.",

Our results suggest that the C-terminal end of N protein may be highly immunogenic. This had been confirmed by Kim et al. who observed a strong T-cell response to the N peptides at aa 346 to 354 when mice were immunized with N protein (Kim et al., 2004) . These peptides were overlapped with the peptide N47 and peptide N48 in our study. Like other CoVs, SARS-CoV N proteins clearly contain multiple immunodominant epitopes and antigenic sites (Stohlman et al., 1994) . Several groups have been extensively studied for B-cell epitopes of N protein in SARS patients He et al., 2004; Liang et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2003; Zhong et al., 2005) . He and his co-workers demonstrated that two major immunodominant epitopes that reacted with more than 75% of sera from SARS patients were localized at the C-terminal and middle regions, corresponding to aa 362 to 412 and 153 to 178, respectively . This suggests that B cells and T cells target to distinct regions of the N protein during the immune response to SARS-CoV. This may be an important consideration in the design of effective vaccines capable of eliciting both humoral and cellular responses.",

Thus, the memory T-cell response of SARS-CoV is unlikely to be effectively boosted. Overall, the frequencies of SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells measured in our study are comparable to those measured in other acute virus infections such as influenza.

After incubation for 20 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were removed and incubated with biotinylated anti-human IFN-\u03b3 detection antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, wells were developed for 1 h with streptavidin-HRP and incubated with substrate reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Spot-forming cells (SFC) were detected with ELIspot image analysis system (Sage Creation). The frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells was calculated as the number of spots/number of total PBMCs per well and was adjusted as the number of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells/10 6 PBMCs. The number of spots in negative control wells was at a range of 0-2 spots.",
