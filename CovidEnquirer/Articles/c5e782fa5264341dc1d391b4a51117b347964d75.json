Compound ML1 1-(2'hydroxy-5'-methoxybenzylidene)amino-3-hydroxyguanidine tosylate gave the best therapeutic indices (TC5o/IC50) of 27.2 and 17.8 for Ad5 and Ad8, respectively. Pretreatment of cells with ML 1 did not affect the adsorption nor the penetration of virus. Ultrastructure studies showed that only the drug treated infected cells had unidentified irregular shaped electron dense structures that might be drug altered viral macromolecules that were not assembled into complete infectious virus particles. Since these compounds have metal chelating properties, their antiviral activity may involve the early IA (EIA) gene which encodes a viral protein of 289 amino acid which has a zinc finger moiety that is required for its transactivation activity.",

            "text": "years. In recent years, it has been reported that severe and occasionally fatal adenoviral infections may occur in infants and young children (Uhnoo et al., 1984; Chiba et al., 1983; Yolken et al., 1982) , and in immunocompromised patients (Shields et al., 1985; Stalder et al., 1977; Zahradnik et al., 1980) . Ocular adenovirus infections occur worldwide and frequently result in epidemics in the community and medical facilities. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, generally caused by adenovirus type 5, 8, 19 or 37, is a frequently occurring and highly infectious disease (Ford et al., 1987) . Although (S)-HPMPC, (S)-HPMPA and 2'-norcyclic GMP were reported to have good antiadenoviral activities (Baba et al., 1987 and Gordon et al., 1991) , currently there exists no antiviral treatment known to prevent or lessen the sequelae of adenovirus-induced diseases in the primary eye involved. Likewise, no treatment exists to protect against the spread of virus to the second eye or to other individuals. Recent reports (Gordon et al., 1992 and Tsai et al., 1992) have described animal models for evaluating the effect of potent experimental antiviral drugs against ocular adenovirus infections.",

Table 2 summarizes the anti-tumor activities of some of these compounds (Tai et al., 1984; T'ang et al., 1985; Koneru, 1991) as well as inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity of ATL14 and ATL16 (Cory et al., 1985) .

It is possible that the antiviral activity of ATL14 against Ad5 and Ad8 is related to either or both the interference with the transactivating ability of the 289 amino acid protein and the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Compounds LT2, LT7 and LT9 did not have any antiadenoviral activities, although they were shown by Tai et al. to have antitumor activities against cultured L1210 cells.

ATL14 has shown potent antiadenoviral activity in the present study but ATL16 and ATL26 have not shown any inhibition at all. In addition, both ATL14 and ATL16 were shown to have inhibition of the ribonucleotide reductase activity, their ICs0 were 22 ~M and 33 pM, respectively, but only ATL14 had antiadenoviral activity. Finally, for the LK series of compounds, LK3 had very low antiadenoviral activity but LK11 was potent. The ICs0 values of their antileukemic activity against the CCRF-CEM/O cell lines were very similar (4.69 #M and 2.95 #M, respectively) (Koneru, 1991 ).

            "text": "ML1 did not inhibit viral replication at 48 and 72 h and this may be due to several factors. First, the kinetics of viral replication may be slowed in drug-treated cultures (Field, 1988) . In this case, the apparent inhibition of yield is a function of time of assay of infectivity, and if left for a sufficiently long period, no inhibition of yield would be observed. Secondly, the antiviral drug stability of ML1 has not yet been established. An unstable compound might have less antiviral activity after an extended incubation period and multiple virus growth cycles, e.g., 48 or 72 h postinoculation. Thirdly, the development of drug-resistance could be at least partially responsible for the failure of ML1 to inhibit virus growth at 48 h. In order to investigate this, both Ad5 and Ad8 were passed four different times in the presence of 40/~M of ML1. The IC50 of ML1 against Ad5 and Ad8 changed from 3.6 to 44 /~M and 5.5 to 47 #M, respectively. This approximate 10-fold increase in IC5o values after multiple virus growth cycles in the presence of drug provides evidence of drug resistance.",
