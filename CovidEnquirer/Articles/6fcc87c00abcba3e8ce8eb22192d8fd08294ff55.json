Our profligate use of non-renewable resources can only lead to shortages, conflict and the misery of the unfortunate. The uncontrolled growth of population will exacerbate the rate of depletion of our dwindling inheritance, resulting in the inevitable decrease in the value we place on human life, with a consequent erosion of those moral systems based on the survival of our genetic and cultural information capital. Some nations already spend between 6% (UK) and 14% (USA) of gross domestic product on taking care of diseased citizens and we should recognize that in the future the amount spent must rise. It is thus clear that the prevention of disease can release resources that can provide a base for society to continue to progress and develop. In addition to human-based disaster scenarios, there are threats from the other organisms of our biosphere. To achieve the present rate of evolution, living organisms have had to walk the tightrope of associating intimately with the carriers and transporters of genetically valuable materials. On the one hand, such carriers could be the bearers of useful and valuable capabilities or properties while, on the other hand, they could effect their own propagation at the expense of the life or well-being of the host.",

The control and elimination of bubonic plague, smallpox, rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, polio, measles, leprosy, tuberculosis, whooping cough, syphilis, rabies, yellow fever and others have lessened man's dread of the untimely death of his loved ones and the despoliation of the animals (and plants) on which his livelihood depended. With increasing confidence that his life's work would not be in vain, the struggle for improvement and progress becomes worthwhile ; it is this positive, proactive attitude that is the foundation for the advancement of our society and, indeed, our continuing evolution both personally and socially. Incidentally there are increases in material wealth and free time not dedicated to personal life-supporting activities. These provide further opportunities to invest in society. One such investment, amply rewarded in the past, is in measures to decrease the effects of those infectious diseases that have not yet been conquered. While such diseases, including AIDS, are not in the category of the plagues of yesteryear, their further control and extinction would contribute significantly to our future progress. It is in this context that I now consider the future development and use of vaccines.",

The pustular fluids elicited by the smallpox virus may be held to have begun the process of seeking immunity by the inoculation of a disease-associated material under conditions that afford the greatest chance of a successful immunization. Such materials are far from being either defined or pure (see F. Brown, in this issue ), so it is hardly surprising that they were fraught with problems, not the least of which was the killing of the inoculee by smallpox. Jenner's use of animal pox postular materials (in addition to his use of cowpox pustular fluid from the palm of Sarah Nelmes in 1796, he used swinepox in 1789 to inoculate his son Edward, who subsequently resisted challenges by inoculated variolus matter in 1791 and 17921 ) led to the human-tohuman transmission of pustular materials. (Cowpox pustular material was not always readily available.) During this process syphilis was transmitted and the recombination of pox viruses probably occurred. This lack of definition of the immunogenic material is clear from our present ignorance of the origin of the vaccinia virus used to protect against smallpox and which provides the basis for some of the deliberately recombined vaccines of the modern era.",

Vaccines protective against the bacterial diseases of diphtheria, tetanus, tuberculosis, bubonic plague and whooping cough followed. Each vaccine began as a monoculture but was far from being defined in terms of knowledge of the molecules and their quantities present in the vaccine (see papers by Walker and Cherry, in this issue ). This mode of vaccine preparation was also used for the viral vaccines protective against yellow fever, mumps, measles, rubella, Newcastle's, foot-and-mouth and Marek's. In each case the monocultured seed material was amplified in a culture system and either stabilized or potentiated by mixtures of incompletely defined materials that resulted in preparations that could cause problems for the recipients of the vaccines 2. From the accidents and upsets experienced by the vaccine producers during the first seven decades of this century, a body of knowledge and practice emerged that kept the deleterious effects of vaccination within tolerable limits. Yet, all the while, the memories of the disasters caused by ill-defined or poorly controlled vaccine preparations cast a cloud over the further development of prophylactic materials; was the cost really worth the benefit? This situation, augmented by the thalidomide calamity, has led to the strengthening of regulatory and licensing agencies in most countries. Has this resulted in vaccines of greater definition and purity? This does not seem to be the case for the varicella vaccine described by Takahashi in this issue : sonicated cell culture fluid is the principal material used in the vaccine. By contrast, the most recently developed virus vaccine for humans, hepatitis A, is based on a purified cell culture fluid of infected and inactivated M RC-5 cells which is aluminium hydroxide adjuvanted and 2-phenoxy-cthanol preserved a. The purification process involved sterile filtration, ultratiltration and concentration by column chromatography. These processes decreased the amount of bovine albumin (a component of the cell culture medium), to <1 ngml-l. Similar care was taken to ensure that the inactivation process using formaldehyde was more effective than that used for the well established inactivated polio vaccines. Although the recently introduced serum vaccine protective against hepatitis B has been largely superseded by genetically engineered equivalents, the introduction of a purified and much inactivated material ~ was permitted in the absence of an alternative vaccine that was yet more advantageous. Thus, purification and definition of the immunogens that have recently been licensed have increased to the point where it is difficult to make further progress. What, then, have the genetic engineers and peptide chemists to offer that can improve on the traditional ways of producing immunogens ?",

            "text": "In this anniversary issue of VACCINE there are two papers (Brown, and Arnon et al.) that look to chemisynthesized immunogens for the vaccines of the future. These authors argue with cogency that such vaccines can be produced in unlimited quantities by processes that are inherently inexpensive and yield products that are defined, pure and stable under the widely variable conditions of temperatures (ambients of up to 40'~C) against which conventional vaccines have to be protected. But can they bc made as effective as thc conventional immunogens? There arc three inherent difficulties for such vaccines. First, they are, perforce, based on linear epitopes. This limits their ability to mimic the conformation-dependent epitopes commonly found as immunogenic epitopcs. Secondly, they cannot be glycosylated in chemisynthetic systems; although there is an epitope that is an effective immunogen and can be produced by the genetic engineering of yeast cells (hepatitis B surface antigen), it does not have the native glycosidic side chains: this could be an exceptional case. Thirdly, the chemisynthesized peptides which are not extensively modified are generally poorly immunogenic. By the time they are made into effective immunogens by being coupled to adjuvants or co-expressed by attachment to hepatitis B virus core antigen proteins or polymerized and coupled to T-cell epitopes, the resulting immunogens have lost some of their putative advantages such as low cost, purity and high stability. This has not, howevcr, prcvented the development of a possibly valuable vaccine protective against malaria by the use of polymerized synthesized antigens with a molecular weight of 150 kDa 5.",

Many of them, for example, the vaccinia recombinant vaccines, are cell culture fluids or sonicates thereof. Others based on the enteric bacteria are presented as live organisms and therefore cannot be defined, while a smaller remaining group are built around bacterial toxins that have been specifically engineered so as to remove the pathogenic components, for example, diphtheria and, in some cases, pertussis.

Thirdly, we wish to achieve a prophylactic effect in a non-infectious disease such as the elimination of a cancer before it becomes an incurable disease (immunotherapeutics?), or the prevention of a pregnancy. Fourthly, although Pasteur demonstrated in 1885 that it was possible to prevent the emergence of the rabies disease in patients who had been infected, we are still struggling to achieve equivalent success in diseases such as those caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) or HIV.

This antibody may then be used to identify the neutralization determinant on the virus, to provide passive protection as an inoculated antibody or to generate an active virus mimicking antigen by the generation of the anti-idiotypic antibody. Arvind Kumar and the author have shown that it is possible to obtain such crossneutralizing monoclonal antibodies to a range of rhinoviruses that even neutralize some of the related polioviruses and coxsackieviruses (unpublished results).

Yet it is possible that the non-specific stimulation of the immune system by adjuvants may prevent the development of diagnosed cancers (see Azuma, this issue ). This also marks a break from the specificity of the traditional vaccine approach and therefore may bc considered post-modern. As a further development of this approach, it may be possible to inoculate killer T cells of the CD8 + lineage, which had been grown in cell culture and whose individuality had been either culturally or genetically expunged in the manner reported to proffer success in the protection of bone marrow transplant patients against infection by cytomegalovirus 1\u00b0.

In 1924 a research establishment of the Footand-Mouth Disease Committee of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture was set up at Pirbright, Surrey, UK 12. Similar institutes focused on the same objective (the implementation of an effective vaccine that would protect cloven-hooved animals against foot-and-mouth disease ) were established in America (Plum Island ), Denmark (Lindholm), the Netherlands ( Lel ystadt ), Italy (Brescia) and many other countries (see contributors to Ref. 13) . The value of the work of these institutes may be estimated from the present situation in America (free from foot-and-mouth disease since 1929 although threatened from Canada in 1952 and Mexico in 19531'*), and in Europe where, having developed effective vaccines in 1947 (Frenkle) and 1963/4 (BHK cell culture )~ s, vaccination to protect cattle against foot-and-mouth disease stopped in 1991/91 (A. Donaldson, personal communication). It is important when considering ventures of this kind to appreciate that once the goal of such an institute has been achieved there must be a recognized programme to redirect, retrain and redeploy the talented staff\" to areas that are similarly bedevilled. One can think immediately that the diseases of malaria, schistosomiasis and the re-emerging tuberculosis could provide new material for such an operation once the HIV problem has been laid to rest.",

This matter is dealt with by Karzon in this issue. There is little doubt that the large-scale use of chimpanzees is not practicable and that monkey models may or may not be suitable subjects from which to learn what we need to know. Humans at risk may, in the final analysis, prove to be the most useful test system. The biggest problem is probably the time taken between the application of a material and the realization of the value of that material in either the prevention or the cure of the disease ; this could be over 15 years! Feedback of this type is almost as much a curse as a blessing, but it is likely to be all we can get.",

In 1988 Langley and the author examined the prospects for a vaccine protective against AIDS ~6 and concluded that '... an ideal prophylactic would have to initiate a reaction, probably in the macrophages, such that intracellular virus is destroyed. This implies that the vaccine we are seeking represents a departure from the conventional vaccinal materials in that the immune system as a whole has to remain quiescent while the macrophage and other cells that harbour virus are stimulated to purge themselves of their passengers.' Clearly, one way of achieving this is by the use of antisense nucleic acids. In September 1990, Wong presented a paper at the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium detailing the use of antisense nucleic acid for the prevention of outbreaks of HSV. It would seem sensible if this route were taken to prevent the emergence of the HIV during the development of AIDS, although one of the main problems with this approach is that not all of the infected cells become superinfected with the antisense material. Would it not be of interest to engineer an HIV-like particle that would contain at its surface the gpl60 so that it would provoke those antibodies that would enable it to be taken up by the macrophages that harbour the wildtype HIV, thus delivering the anti-Prophylaxis: the foundation for our future progress: R.E. Spier sense nucleic acid to the infected cells ?",

It also obviates the need to consider the complex problems resulting from a change of the physiological function of the immune system cells that could lead to a change in the lymphokine profile; the latter can be held responsible for the apothosis of the T cells in the absence of the infection of those cells t 7. While it is appropriate to call for the discovery of the aetiology of the disease (but see Ref. 18 ) in order to 'rationally' design a vaccine, if this method of achieving a vaccine were to be successful it would probably be the first such rationally designed vaccine in the history of vaccination. Rather, we have to proceed in a reasonable way by trial and error using the empirical method of allowing the results of experiments to determine how we proceed, as opposed to theoretical notions derived from rationally derived models, the dogmatic acceptance of which can do more harm than good. It is clear to this author that, having discovered that the genome of the HIV integrates with the host-cell chromosome, the battlefield for the viability of the cell is the host-cell chromosome itself; that is where the antisense material can exert its greatest effect.",

Vaccine prophylaxis has a key role to play in the prevention of these catastrophes that are caused by microbes on our planet. It can also be used to prevent the increase in world population and the diseases of the body that are susceptible to the control of the immune system. Our increasing ability to read the language that is used by the cells to control their activities will lead to further developments in the use of induced antibodies, though in such cases it will be difficult to adhere to the concept that the interference is of a preventive nature and the inducer of the effect is a vaccine. Nevertheless, by the controlled modulation of the components of the immune system and through them the other controlling systems in the body, we are set fair to achieve not only what we desire but also that which we have not yet had the courage to dream about.",
