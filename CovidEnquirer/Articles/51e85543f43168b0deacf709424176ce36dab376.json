This area of inquiry is of special interest because of our persistent ignorance of the mechanisms at the basis of viral pathogenesis and virus-host interactions [1, 19] . To define the molecular structural determinants possibly involved in viral virulence and human susceptibility, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of a large set of viral proteomes searching for amino acid sequences shared with the human proteome. Specifically, the study was designed to answer two main questions: (i) what is the quantitative dimension of shortpeptide sequence sharing between viruses and human proteomes? (ii) How many human proteins harbor viral peptide modules? The two questions are of paramount importance in the context of autoimmune diseases. Indeed, it is a common belief that an autoimmune reaction is mostly caused by a host receiving an antigen that has amino acid homology/similarity with amino acid sequences in selfantigens of the host [20] . This may result in the host immune system attacking the organs and tissues expressing the selfantigens with the shared sequences [23] . In this context and given the sustained increase in the incidence of autoimmune diseases [2, 8, 18, 22] , the mathematical quantification of peptide overlap extent between viruses and humans is essential to understand the role of structural viral similarity in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Here we report a virus versus human comparative screening that reveals a massive, indiscriminate, unexpected pentapeptide overlapping between viral and human proteomes.",

A similarly sized control set of 30 human protein samples (for a total of 686 human proteins, equal to 302,520 amino acids) was analyzed for inter-human overlapping. More precisely, for each viral proteome size, we constructed an artificial human sub-proteome drawn from the human protein set. The proteins were selected at random without replacement, and assigned to an artificial sub-proteome at random. We kept adding human proteins to each artificial human sub-proteome until adding the next protein would have caused the total number of amino acids in the artificial sub-proteome to exceed to the number of amino acids in the corresponding viral proteome. This way we eliminated possible bias in the comparison. The 30 artificial sub-proteomes are random samplings of human proteins and represent cross-sections of all human proteins.

The scans were performed by custom programs written in C and utilizing suffix trees for efficiency [6] . The viral or human proteins were manipulated and analyzed as follows. The entire viral (or human) proteome was decomposed in silico to a set of 5-mers (including all duplicates). A library of unique 5-mers for each virus or human proteome was then created by removing duplicates. Next, for each 5-mer in the library, the entire human proteome was searched for instances of the same 5-mer. Any such occurrence was termed an overlap. Cursory analyses (e.g. identification of unique overlapping 5-mers, counts of unique overlapping 5-mers, counts of duplications) were performed using LINIX/UNIX shell scripts and standard LINUX/UNIX utilities. Data were plotted and linear least-squares regression was performed to determine whether any linear relationships exist between the level of overlap and the size of viral (or control) proteomes. The same procedure was applied when longer amino acid sequences (esa-, epta-, octapeptides, etc.) were used as probes in the similarity analyses.",

When 30 human artificial sub-proteomes were analyzed for pentapeptide overlapping to the entire human proteome, we obtained clear numerical evidence that the inter-human level of perfect 5-mer matching is of the same order of magnitude as the viral overlapping to human proteome detailed in Table 4 , i.e. there are 3,713,010 inter-human versus 2,907,096 viral perfect 5-mer matches to the human proteome (see Table 5 ). Likewise, the number of human proteins involved in viral and inter-human overlaps is highest and practically identical in the numbers: human proteins are involved in the inter-human peptide overlapping for 697,373 times and in the viral versus human (2) total number of 5-mers in the artificial sub-proteome (including multiple occurrences); (3) unique 5-mers from the artificial subproteome occurring in the human proteome; (4) occurrences in the human proteome of 5-mers from artificial sub-proteome (including multiple occurrences); (5) number of human proteins in the human proteome involved in overlap; (6) % of unique 5-mers from the artificial sub-proteome which occur in the human proteome (i.e. 100 \u00c2 column 3/column 1). a Analogous to viral proteomes in size (see Table 1 ), and composed by set of human proteins as detailed in Table 3 overlap for 633,229 times (see data from Tables 4 and 5 , respectively).

The Pearson's correlation coefficient of the line is 0.97452, and represents an exceptionally strong linear relationship. Biologically, Fig. 1 suggests that peptide motif sharing is a constant property of the viral proteomes, exclusively depending on the viral proteome length and with no relationship to other structural and/or pathogenic viral features. As a note of interest, it can be seen that HTLV-1, Rubella virus, and HCV present a number of overlaps to the human proteome above the expected number of overlaps predicted by the linear regression line.

This is remarkable in light of the enormously high number of potential n-peptides which theoretically are available. As an example, in face of the possible 3,200,000 pentamers, both the 30 viral proteomes and the 30 human sub-proteomes present a high degree of repetitiveness in their 5-mer composition. In fact, the 30 viral proteomes and the 30 human sub-proteomes are respectively formed by a total of 299,701 and 299,749 5-mers and, although there is the possibility of forming 3,200,000 different pentapeptides, these total 5-mers present 42,666 and 44,941 repeated pentapeptides, in the viral and human proteins, respectively. The intra-viral (or intra-human) peptide redundancy strikingly persists at higher n-mer level, despite the exponentially increasing numbers of theoretically possible nmers. The intra-repetitiveness is mathematically quantified in Table 8 , columns 3 and 6, for the 30 viral proteomes and the 30 human sub-proteomes, respectively. The second set of data illustrates the overlapping at npeptide level (with n from 5 to 16 amino acids) from the 30 viral proteomes versus the 30 human sub-proteomes (Table 8, columns 7 and 8) . Again, we note that, although there is a potential pentapeptide reservoir amounting to 3,200,000, still 42,647 of unique viral pentapeptides (16.6% of the total) appear in the human proteins forming the 30 human sub-proteomes. When considering the total viral pentapeptides including multiple occurrences (Table 8 , column 8), the viral contribution to the 30 human subproteomes raises to 56,230 pentamers. These repeated viral overlaps in the human proteins appear to further support the existence of a defined peptide repertoire which is utilized (even repeatedly) in protein composition. A similar observation holds in considering the viral peptide overlapping to the 30 human sub-proteomes at higher n-mer level (Table 8,  columns 7 and 8) .",

Rather, powerful constraints appear to be at work by forcing the use of restricted platforms of n-mers and privileging the repeated usage of the chosen ones. Possibly, as anticipated by preliminary data from our labs (Kusalik et al., manuscript in preparation), these powerful constraints able to influence and favor specific n-mer synthesis might be found among physico-chemical factors such as hydrophobicity, residue bulkiness, DG8 of peptide bond formation, plus biological factors such as codon bias. 4.",

            "text": "The difference between biological entities such as viruses and cellular organisms is quite obvious when the functional roles of the proteins found in viruses and in cellular organisms are compared [24] . On the other hand, according to the data we present here, this obvious difference disappears at the peptide phenetic level. The mathematical quantification of the widespread and high pentapeptide similarity between viral and human proteomes is surprising, raising fundamental questions. In particular, the ample viral-human peptide sharing is significant to (auto)immune phenomena as well as to evolutionary pathways. Indeed, in the context of the physio(patho)logical relationships between viruses and humans, it is mandatory to observe that short-peptide motifs can exert a central role in cell adhesion, signal transduction, hormone activity, regulation of transcript expression, and enzyme activity [3, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17] . Likewise, the antigen-antibody recognition process can reductionistically be circumscribed to interacting modules of five amino acid residues which, therefore, appear to be sufficient structural immunological determinants ( [11] [12] [13] 17] and Refs. therein). Consequently, we notice that the data shown here call into question the possibility of a direct causal association between virus-host sharing of amino acid motifs and incitement of autoimmune reactions [20] . Indeed, the molecular mimicry hypothesis suggests that, when bacterial/viral agents share epitopes with a host's proteins, an immune response against the infectious agent may result in formation of crossreacting antibodies that bind the shared epitopes on the normal cell and result in the auto-destruction of the cell. In the present case, the molecular mimicry hypothesis implies that viral infections should be a practically infinite source of autoimmunity diseases since this study demonstrates that viral 5-mer matches are disseminated throughout practically all the human proteome and each viral match is repeated almost more than 10 times (see Table 4 ). Consequently, autoimmune diseases should theoretically approach a 100% real incidence, since the 30 viruses we examined practically are more or less disseminated throughout the entire human species. Taking HCV as an example, we note that the virus versus human overlap analysis in Table 4 produces the mathematical evidence that HCV (as well as HTLV-1 and Rubella virus) are even ''more similar'' to the human proteins than that expected by the linear regression relationship reported in Fig. 3 . The data reinforce and add to our previous report on the sharing of numerous perfect exact matches between HCV and human proteomes [16] . Since 2760 out of 3003 HCV 5-mers occur in the human proteome, the 46,731 occurrences include multiple/repeated matches in the human proteins. More exactly, each HCV 5-mer that overlaps with the human proteome are repeated an average of 16.5 times. Moreover, the 46,731 occurrences occur in 20,269 different human proteins (Table 4 ). That means that almost 60% of the 36,103 human proteins forming the H. sapiens proteome contain viral HCV pentamers. This datum is of cogent interest in the present worldwide advance of HCV infection, since it further excludes sequence similarity as a possible mechanism in HCVassociated autoimmunity phenomena and, at the same time, might address research towards new unexplored scenarios. These observations, of course, apply to almost all the viruses listed in Table 1 .",

De facto, it seems that viruses and mammalians have drawn and draw from a common ancient melting pot of short-peptide modules in building up their proteomes, either simple or complex. Indeed, it seems that human evolution has paid very little attention to a peptide motif being viral or not. The reconstruction of the informational network relating all living organisms might be helped by an integration with the present data which recall a time when the totality of life on Earth was a simple heterogeneous community that shared only the ability to synthesize proteins with a ribosomal machine and that freely exchanged genetic material [4] .",
