Also it is worthwhile to mention that in the recent past year Saudi Arabia has witnessed many human cases with a MERS Corona virus which need to be followed and evaluated carefully to prevent the spread of Corona virus during Hajj and Omrah, and this recommended to be planned in a scientific approach without increasing the anxiety and fear in the community. 3 It is highly important that Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia plans the line of action strategy about the necessary Ebola preparedness plan for screening the immigrants at international airports, seaports and major ground crossing. Also there should be local governmental policies regarding the screening of immigrants at these ports, quarantine protocol and contact tracing of Ebola suspected individuals, also there should be a guideline of screening the people with fever and tracing in case if they acquire infection at entry and exit port. Also ministry of health in Saudi Arabia has recently distributed to all health care teams the infectious disease of Ebola virus diversion plans for Hajj. 4 And this important and critical task needs the cooperation of all concern health sectors in the World to work closely together in achieving healthy hajj period and a healthy life all over the world. and finally the message to all health care workers all over the World to be aware about the Ebola virus disease and to work together in an evidence based approach and according to the instruction of the world health organization and ministries of health to achieve a healthy life in all countries.",
