[17] Key to the success of this work is the unique nature of the KAHA ligation using 5-oxaproline,w hich operates under acidic conditions ideal for solubilizing hydrophobic peptide segments and delivers more soluble peptide esters compared to amide as the primary ligation product. Theu se of 5-oxaproline results in the introduction of homoserine,anon-canonical amino acid, at the ligation site.W hen carefully chosen, we have found that this is an innocuous mutation of many residues and have shown that it does not disturb folding or biological activity.

[25] Thefragments NpecOpr-S2-KA (2)and Opr-S3-ArgTAG (3)were joined by the first KAHA ligation.

Ther eaction mixture was diluted to 10 mm with NMP and left at 60 8 8Cfor an additional 10 hb ut no change was observed, thus indicating that the ligation reaction had reached maximum conversion.

Synthetic IFITM3 was incubated with vesicles and then passed through Sepharose CL-4B exclusion resin.
