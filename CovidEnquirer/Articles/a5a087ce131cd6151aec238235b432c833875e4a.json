Although TMEV is an enteric pathogen of mice, certain neurotropic strains when injected i.c. present a un;que biphasic disease (Lipton 1975 ). The first phase, acute infection (2-3 weeks), is characterized by destruction of infected ventral horn neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) gray matter. This phase depends upon dose and strain of virus and thus is not always clinically apparent in all infected mice. If present, the paralysis associated with lower motor neuron disease (LMND) usually stabilizes. The second phase consists of chronic inflammatory demyelinating lesions which may persist for months (Lipton 1975) . In this late-onset demyelinating disease that is associated with chronic TMEV infection, the clinical signs observed are a gait abnormality and loss of righting reflex (RR). Signs generally occur 9-12 weeks following infection, However, Lipton and Dal Canto (1976, 1977) have shown that demyelination is present as early as 3 weeks post-infection, even while signs of progressive LMND may be present.",

Specific Ab [MBP] may thus be elicited if MBP enters the vascular compartment in an immunogenic form. We have eliminated TMEV viral protein as a source of a common or cross-reacting epitope by both absorption and immunoblot analysis, but the mechanism of induction of Ab[MBP] and its role, if any, in the clinical and pathologic development of TMEV-associated demyelination remains to be determined.",

A control of uninfected BHK cell lysate was subsequently tested as an absorbent when it was noted that some TMEV-BHK preparations removed Ab [MBP] . When the clarified lysate of TMEV-infected BHK cells was used as the source of virus for absorption, the titer to both TMEV and MBP was reduced, indicating cross-reaction between the BHK lysate and MBP. When uninfected BHK cell lysate was used as an absorbent, Ab[MBP] titer was reduced but Ab[TMEV] remained relatively unchanged. Absorption with purified MBP did not significantly reduce the Ab[TMEV]. Inasmuch as uninfected BHK cell lysates absorbed Ab[MBP], we repeated the absorptions with purified TMEV (a gift of Dr. H. Lipton, Northwestern University). The antisera were highly specific in that Ab[TMEV] titer was reduced following absorption with TMEV protein but not with MBP. Conversely the Ab[MBP] titer was reduced following absorption with MBP and not following absorption with TMEV. Guinea pig MBP (gpMBP) was used to absorb Ab [MBP] . Since the induced antibody was presumably elicited against degraded mouse myelin, the difference between the absorbent antigen and the immunogen could account for the occasionally inadequate adsorptions of Ab[MBP] by gpMBP.

Although the incidence of autoantibodies in general may be increased with age in animals, the appearance of Ab [MBP] in uninoculated mice in our colony is a rare observation, and is not associated with age. Ab[TMEV] is seen at a frequency of 10-20% in our uninfected mouse colony, presumably due to the occurrence of sporadic natural infection with wild-type virus. However, the experimental mice arrive from Jackson Laboratories at 3 weeks of age, are immediately placed in isolation, and within 24 h after arrival are inoculated i.c. with the DA strain of the virus, thereby assuring that the observed Ab[TMEV] is due specifically to the i.c. infection of these animals.",

When the TMEV-BHK and BHK cell lysate were both discovered to absorb Ab[MBP], immunoblot analysis was undertaken using the TMEV-BHK lysate. All Ab[TMEV] sera tested reacted with the three major TMEV protein bands on the blot and not with bands in blots of mouse spinal cord homogenate or myelin extract. Ab[MBP] sera from rabbits hyperimmunized with bovine or human MBP bound to three bands in the 100-150 kDa area of the blot of TMEV-BHK or control BHK lysate. It appears that the BHK cell lysate contains cross-reactive protein(s), the nature of which needs further clarification.",

It is challenging to determine how such a virus infection in fact triggers an autoimmune response. In the target cell or tissue, infection may release or expose new antigens. This could be the case in the coronavirus infection or in the TMEV infection as reported here. In other situations, extensive and chronic injury of a tissue or organ results in autoantibody production as in the case of severe chronic hepatitis (Meliconi et al. 1983 ). This may be one explanation for the appearance of Ab[MBP] following inflammatory demyelination in Theiler's virus infection. Myelin degradation may lead to immunogenic forms of MBP that could enter the vascular compartment to induce an immune response. In fact, when MBP is injected into the CSF, it is transported through the blood-brain barrier and presented on the lumenal surface of endothelial cells of the cerebral and meningeal veins (Vass et al. 1984 ). This indicates a means by which MBP from inflammatory demyelinating lesions may enter the vascular compartment and elicit an immune response.",

Interferons (IFN) are produced following some viral infections by activated T cells shown to be present in certain inflammatory brain lesions. Ordinarily brain cells express low levels of antigens encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (H-2), but in the presence of IFN, MHC gene expression was dramatically enhanced: most astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and some neurons expressed H-2 antigens. IFNv, also induced Ia antigens on a subpopulation of astrocytes (Nakamura et al. 1984; Wong et al. 1984) . The capacity of IFN, produced as a result in viral infection, to induce H-2 or Ia antigens may account for the findings of Fontana et al. (1984) , who observed that astrocytes which displayed these antigens following contact with T cells could successfully present MBP to immunologically active encephalitogenic T cell lines.",

We would like to acknowledge the excellent technical assistance of Sandra Cola in performing both the assays for serum antibody and the assay for MBP in the CSF and Diane Studzinski in performing the immunoblot assays. In addition we would like to acknowledge the work of Jewell Akins in caring for the mice, scoring them and collecting the CSF. We would also like to acknowledge the assistance of Keith Kelly and Cherine Abdalla in collecting the CSF.",
