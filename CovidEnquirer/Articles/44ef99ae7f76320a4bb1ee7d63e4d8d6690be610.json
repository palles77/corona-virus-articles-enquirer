            "text": "An SEQIJR model of epidemic disease transmission which includes immunization and a varying population size is studied. The model includes immunization of susceptible people (S), quarantine (Q) of exposed people (E), isolation (J) of infectious people (I), a recovered population (R), and variation in population size due to natural births and deaths and deaths of infected people. It is shown analytically that the model has a disease-free equilibrium state which always exists and an endemic equilibrium state which exists if and only if the disease-free state is unstable. A simple formula is obtained for a generalized reproduction number R g where, for any given initial population, R g < 1 means that the initial population is locally asymptotically stable and R g > 1 means that the initial population is unstable. As special cases, simple formulas are given for the basic reproduction number R 0 , a disease-free reproduction number R d f , and an endemic reproduction number R en . Formulas are derived for the sensitivity indices for variations in model parameters of the disease-free reproduction number R d f and for the infected populations in the endemic equilibrium state. A simple formula in terms of the basic reproduction number R 0 is derived for the critical immunization level required to prevent the spread of disease in an initially disease-free population. Numerical simulations are carried out using the Matlab program for parameters corresponding to the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, Hong Kong, Canada and Singapore in 2002 and 2003 . From the sensitivity analyses for these four regions, the parameters are identified that are the most important for preventing the spread of disease in a disease-free population or for reducing infection in an infected population. The results support the importance of isolating infectious individuals in an epidemic and in maintaining a critical level of immunity in a population to prevent a disease from occurring.",

A susceptible person is an uninfected person who can be infected through contact with an infectious or exposed person, an exposed person is someone who has come into contact with an infectious person but is asymptomatic, an infectious person is symptomatic, and a recovered person is someone who has recovered from the disease. It is assumed that a recovered individual cannot become infected again. In an SEQIJR model, two extra categories of quarantined (Q) and isolated (J ) are added to the SEIR model. A quarantined person is an exposed person who is removed from contact with the general population and an isolated person is an infectious person who is removed from contact with the general population, usually by being admitted to a hospital. Quarantine and isolation are important in controlling epidemics because they are effective methods of reducing the contact between infected and susceptible populations.",

Firstly, Gumel et al. suggested parameter values which can be used to obtain physically reasonable models for the four SARS outbreaks in Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto. Secondly, considerable data are available on the SARS outbreaks and mathematical models and the effectiveness of control measures have been studied by many authors (see, e.g., [3, 7, 11, 13, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 26, 30] ).",

They analyzed the effects of quarantine and isolation on the transmission of SARS and showed that an effective isolation policy was more important than quarantine or a combination of quarantine and a less effective isolation policy in reducing the transmission of the disease. A similar conclusion was obtained by Koonprasert et al. [9] in a numerical study of the effectiveness of quarantine and isolation. However, as noted by a number of authors (see, e.g., [4, 5, 14, 15, 24, 28] ), the effectiveness of isolation requires strict hospital hygiene to reduce the hospital-based (nosocomial) spread of a disease.",

A change in value of the determinant cannot be used to detect a change in stability if the change is due to a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis, e.g., if an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation occurs (see, e.g., [10] ). Therefore, a negative trace and a positive determinant for the Jacobian of a system of 6 equations are necessary but not sufficient conditions for the real parts of all eigenvalues to be negative and for an equilibrium point to be locally stable. However, for any given set of parameter values it is very easy to check if R g < 1 corresponds to asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point by numerically computing all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix with any of the standard mathematical software packages such as Matlab, Mathematica, Maple etc.",

The values in column 2 of Table 6 are the sensitivity indices and the values in column 3 are % changes in parameter values required to give a 1% decrease in R d f .

The solutions for the S, I and R populations are shown in Fig. 3 first for a short integration time to show the initial behavior and then for a long integration time to show the convergence to an endemic equilibrium. It can be seen that the convergence to the endemic equilibrium is very slow and that many disease outbreaks occur during this period. This type of behavior was very common in \"childhood\" diseases such as measles, mumps, poliomyelitis, rubella, whooping cough etc. before vaccines became available for these diseases. Although it is difficult to see in Fig. 3 , we found that epidemics can recur when the fraction of the susceptible population exceeds a certain critical level due to births or if the population of the immune recovered population falls below a certain critical level due to deaths.

It is also desirable to reduce the number of deaths from the disease, i.e., to increase the total surviving population N * 2 . From the indices in Table 7 , the most effective methods of reducing I * 2 are, in order, to increase the isolation rate (\u03b3 2 ), reduce the transfer rate from exposed to infectious population (k 1 ), increase the quarantine rate (\u03b3 1 ) and reduce the contact rate between infectious and susceptible people (\u03b2). The most effective methods of reducing J * 2 are, in order, to increase the recovery rate of isolated individuals (\u03c3 2 ), reduce the contact rate \u03b2, and reduce the modification parameter \u03b5 J . It can be seen from Table 7 that increasing the death rates d 1 and d 2 of the infectious and isolated individuals would also reduce the infectious and isolated populations. This method is clearly not an acceptable control method for a human disease. However, this method was adopted as an effective control method in the case of the spread of avian flu among chickens in China and \"mad-cow disease\" in England, and it has also been used as an effective method of controlling some other diseases among animals and plants.",

The results show that there is a big difference between the critical immunization levels and critical immunized ratio in the four regions. The difference is due to the different values of the basic reproduction number R 0 = \u03b1 L \u03b1 S in the four regions. The difference in R 0 values in turn is mainly due to differences in the values of the infection factor \u03b2 and the modification factors for infection from the quarantined population (\u03b5 Q ) and the isolated population (\u03b5 J ).",

As special cases, we have obtained simple formulas for the reproduction numbers for a 100% susceptible population (the basic reproduction number R 0 = \u03b1 L \u03b1 S ) and for the disease-free equilibrium R d f = \u00b5\u03b1 L (\u00b5+\u03bd)\u03b1 S by both the next-generation method [23] and from the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the linearized model about the disease-free equilibrium. In these formulas, \u03b1 L can be interpreted as the rate of new infections from all infected individuals and \u03b1 S as the rate of reduction of the susceptible population due to transfers to other population groups including to the recovered immune group. The effect of the immunization rate (\u03bd) in reducing the reproduction number and increasing the stability of disease-free equilibrium states can be clearly seen by comparing the R 0 and R d f formulas. We have also obtained simple formulas for a reproduction number R en for the endemic equilibrium state and shown that the endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if R en < 1 and does not exist if R en > 1.

SEIR models have, of course, been studied by many authors and there is now an extensive literature on them.
