Informed consent was obtained from the children's parents, and the study was approved by the internal review board of Sanggyepaik Hospital. Viral RNA was extracted from each sample by using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany), and reverse transcription of 0.5 \u03bcg of each RNA sample was performed. All nasopharyngeal aspirates from the study population were tested for common respiratory viruses such as human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), infl uenza virus A and B, parainfl uenza virus (PIV), and adenovirus by using multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (6, 7) . The rest of each specimen was then frozen at -80 o C until tested. RT-PCR assays were performed for rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (hCoV)-NL63, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E, and hCoV HKU-1, as described (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Positive and negative controls were included in each experiment.",

The plasmids containing major capsid protein (VP)-1 region of KIPyV and VP-2 region of WUPyV as positive control were donated by Tobias Allander and David Wang. All PCR products for WUPyV and KIPyV were sequenced to confi rm the specifi city for each virus. PCR product was examined after electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Amplicon was purifi ed and sequenced in both directions. Nucleotide sequences were aligned by using BioEdit version 7.0 (www. mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html) and presented in a topology tree, prepared in MEGA 3.1 (15) . Using SAS software version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA), we performed the Fisher exact test to compare the proportion of symptomatic WUPyV patients with those who were in the control groups.",

The clinical symptoms of WUPyV infection in children were similar to those of other viral respiratory tract infections such as hRSV and hBoV. Gastrointestinal symptoms were found in 23.5% (8/34) of WUPyV-positive children. The 31 WUPyV strains detected in symptomatic children and 3 WUPyV strains in asymptomatic children, which were directly sequenced, clustered into 1 VP2 lin-eage (GenBank accession nos.

Our detection of WUPyV in 34 (7.0%) of 486 children with acute lower respiratory tract infection suggests that the virus is prevalent in South Korea. Our fi nding of 27 (6.5%) WUPyV-positive samples among 416 patients <24 months of age compared with 7 (10%) positive samples from 70 patients >24 months of age suggests that WUPyV infection may occur more frequently in older children than in younger children; however, studies for latent infection of the virus are needed to confi rm. Clinical diagnoses for patients with WUPyVpositive results only included bronchiolitis, tracheobronchitis, pneumonia, and croup. Coinfection of WUPyV with other respiratory viruses, especially hRSV, did not seem to infl uence the severity of disease, although we did not perform statistical analysis. Although our study tested for more viruses than previous studies and included a control group, whether detection of WUPyV in nasopharyngeal specimens means infection or just transmission in the respiratory tract remains unclear. We performed PCR assays for WUPyV in stool samples from 72 children who had acute gastroenteritis during the same study period, but it was not detected (data not shown).",
