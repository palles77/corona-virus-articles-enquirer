Diarrheal illnesses remain a major clinical problem for patients infected with HN; particularly those with the life-threatening AIDS. In Africa, diarrhea occurs in 60 to 90% of HIV infection' and \"slim disease,\" prolonged diarrhea, and wasting usually, attributable to coccidian parasites, is pathognomic of AIDS in central Africa.',* Set-o prevalence of HIV in Senegal is about 1.6%, and nearly 80% of adults with AIDS present initially with diarrhea and weight loss. A wide variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens can cause diarrhea in patients with advanced HIV infection. Although diarrhea occurs frequently, its optimal management remains controversial3 Bacterial pathogens in AIDS patients may manifest differently from infections in immunocompetent hosts. Other pathogens, including Cryptosporidium and Microsporidium, are difficult to diagnose and have no effective therapy. Moreover, enteric viruses and HIV itself may contribute to the diarrhea.* Only limited information is available regarding the etiology, clinical consequences, and immunologic effects of infection with diarrheal agents in the immunocompromised host. Consequently, the authors conducted a survey in Senegal among HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative subjects to identify major types and prevalences of bacteria, parasites, fungi, and Rotaviruses associated with diarrhea in adult patients, with the goal to provide guidance to physicians for case management.",

Freshly collected stool samples were examined immediately after collection, by dark-field microscopy, for motile bacteria, trophozoites, red blood cells, and leukocytes. Stool specimens were treated with saline and iodine preparations and examined for intestinal parasites; furthermore, formalin-ether concentrates and smears stained with Merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde solution were prepared from each of the specimens and examined microscopically. Coccidia and Microsporidia were detected respectively by Kinyoun stain and modified trichrome stain with a high concentration of chromotrope 2 R.5 The modified Kinyoun acid-fast stain was used for detection of mycobacteria. Rotaviruses were identified with a commercial latex agglutination test (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur). Bacteria such as Escberichia coli, Salmonella spp, Shigella spp, Yersinia spp,Aeromonas spp, Plesiomonas spp, Vibrio spp, Campylobacter spp, and fungi were identified by standard methods.6 Identification of CZostridium spp was undertaken only if gram-positive rods were seen after Gram staining.

Phenotypic characterization of pathogenic E. coli was performed by a microtiter ganglioside enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (GMl-ELISA) for the thermolabile enterotoxin,\" the suckling mouse assay for the thermostable enterotoxin,'* and the guinea pig keratoconjunctivitis assay for enteroinvasive E. coli.\" All E. coli isolates were examined for HEp-2 cell adherence in eight-well chamber slides (LAB-TEK, Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL, USA), according to Vial et al.'* HEp-2 cell adherence was characterized as localized (IA), aggregate (AA), or diffuse (DA) adherence. HEp2 adherence pattern and virulence gene were performed on five colonies of E. coli. Escherichia coli was considered to be the etiologic agent of the diarrheal illness when a significant virulence gene was identified on at least three of five tested colonies. Serotypes of Salmonella spp and ShigeZZa spp were determined using slide agglutination.The antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial enteropathogens was determined using the disk diffusion test.15 ",

            "text": "The various serotypes were S. enteritidis (5 among cases; 1 among controls), S. kentacky (2 among cases), S. typhi (1 among cases), S. sangera (1 among cases), S. magherafelt (1 among cases), S. tambacounda (2 among cases; 1 among controls), S. glostrup (1 among cases), and S. typhimurium (Table 4 ). Concerning the prevalence of different E. coli pathotypes identified by PCR (see Table 4 ), at least one target gene was found in 205 (34.5%) patients, and a target gene was found more often in cases (125/279,44.8%) than in controls @O/315,25.3%), P = 0.00001. Results show a high prevalence of afa gene in cases (66/219) as well as in controls (63/3 15); consequently pathogenic E. coli were E. coli strains with at least one virulence factor different from afu gene. Inversely, enteroaggregative and enteroinvasive E. coli seem to be closely related respectively to chronic and acute diarrhea. Isolation of enteroinvasive E. coli (ipaH gene ) was not dependent on HIV-serostatus, and no asymptomatic carriage was found for this pathotype. In contrast, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAgg gene) was isolated more frequently in HIV-seropositive patients Only one strain of E. coli carrying three virulence genes (afu, eae, EAgg) was identified in an HIV-seropositive patient with chronic diarrhea. Except for the ipaH gene, other virulence genes were identified in patients with CD4 count ranging from 11 to 259 cells/mm3. There was good correlation between genotypic and phenotypic characterization of enterotoxigenic and enteroinvasive E. coli. Two strains were positive in the GMl-ELBA test for heat-labile enterotoxin and in the suckling mouse model assay for heat-stable enterotoxin; all strains carrying @aH gene were positive for the guinea pig keratoconjunctivitis Sereny test. Unusual bacterial etiologies like Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), Citrobacter freundii (n = 4) were found in immunocompromised patients with diarrhea. One of the Citrobacter spp strains was isolated from a 6&-year-old HIVseronegative woman with diabetes. The other strains were from HIV-seropositive patients with very low CD4 counts. In all these cases oral antibiotic therapy proved to be effective. These opportunistic bacterial pathogens were examined for HEp-2 cell adherence, and all showed a diffuse adherence pattern except three strains of K. pneumoniae, which displayed the \"stacked-brick\" aggregative adherence pattern typical of enteroaggregative E. coli strains and one strain of C. freundii (different from the one isolated from the 68-y-old woman) displaying the localized adherence attaching and effacing pattern typical of enteropathogenic E. coli. Polymerase chain reaction for E. coli virulence genes was negative for almost all strains except one K.pneumoniae with EAgg gene and one C. freundii gene with eae gene. Table 5 illustrates the antibiotic susceptibility of the 117 strains of bacterial enteropathogens recovered from cases and controls. All isolates were susceptible to am&a&, gentamicin, broadspectrum cephalosporin, and ciprofloxacin. Shigella spp and pathogenic E. coli were highly resistant to ampicillin, ticarcillin, cotrimoxazole, and tetracycline. Most enteropathogenic strains remained susceptible to ampicillin and clavulanic acid, third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Interestingly, Salmonella strains remain susceptible to almost all antibiotics except tetracyclines.",

This study confirms the association between persistent diarrhea and enteroaggregative E. coli previously suspected in other countries.'\" However, some of the isolates from group 1 patients displayed the \"stacked brick\" aggregative adherence pattern on HEp-2 cells but lacked the typical virulence factor of enteroaggregative E. coli strains (EAggEC gene). This phenomenon has been observed by other investigators, l7 and it suggests existence of other virulence factors. The current results suggest that afa gene is not a significant virulence gene in adults in Senegal, but it is often associated with other E. COD individuals of all age groups. The alarming rates of resistance to the most affordable antibiotics found in Dakar (tetracycline, cotrimoxazole) provide evidence of the need for more rational use of antibiotics. In fact high resistance to tetracycline emerged in Senegal after an intensive use of this drug during the cholera epidemic in 1995. 2\" In the present study, about 30% of cases of diarrhea were of unknown etiology An extensive evaluation including stool studies and endoscopic biopsies of both colon and small intestine has been widely recommended to identify all potential pathogenic organisms.\" Stool viruses, such as adenovirus and coronavirus, were described as the possible causes of diarrhea in HIVinfected patients in Berlin. *l Unusual pathogens such as spirochetes have been described as a possible cause of diarrhea in HIV-infected persons in Central African Republic. l9 Moreover, enteric viruses and HIV itself may contribute to the diarrhea. In addition to microbes, other factors, such as medication, immune dysregulation, automatic dysfunction, and nutritional supplementation, play a substantial role in diarrhea in patients with AIDS.*",

Eight different serotypes were identified from the 18 isolated strains of S. enterica; a similar study conducted in Bangui (Central African Republic) showed only two different serotypes from 39 strains.'\" The limited diversity of serotypes in Bangui can be explained by the geographic situation of the country and the quasi absence of imported foods and crops. In contrast, spirochetes were found in Bangui and not in Dakar, where 80% of the population is muslim and has no contact with pigs. Identification of A. sobria (A. veronii bv sobria) as an etiologic agent of diarrhea in an HIV-infected patient emphasizes the implication of this bacteria in diarrhea of the immunocompromised host. A case of acute diarrhea produced by A. sobria (A. veronii bv sobria) in a patient colectomized for Crohn's disease was reported by de Sola Earle et a1.19 Overall, the literature suggests that Aeromonas sp, once mainly considered an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised humans, is now implicated as an etiologic agent in numerous clinical situations involving immunocompetent",
