A hapten-sandwich procedure was reported for immunospecific labeling of cell surface antigens with markers visible by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 1 Antihapten antibody was used to link hapten-modified tobacco mosaic virus and bushy stunt virus. Viral identification by SEM of preparations stained with fluorescein-labeled antibody was described by Springer et al, 2 using hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes by influenza virus as a model. Transmission electron microscopy has been widely used for the study of viral structure and morphogenesis, although the low concentration of viral particles in some clinical used for the preparation of highly concentrated suspensions of mosaic viruses and human adenovirus type 5. The advantage of this technique over conventional negative staining is the formation of two-dimen-sional and three-dimensional crystalline arrays of viruses. The packing arrangement of the viruses could be varied according to the type of negative stain and pH used during the preparation. Doane et al 6 described a two-hour embedding procedure for intracellular detection of viruses in tissue culture as well as tissue biopsy specimens. The total processing time by this method required two hours compared with an average of 24 to 32 hours by the standard method. However, there was slight decrease of specimen detail with less than optimal staining compared with the standard techniques. Doane 4 reported that identification of viris by immunoelectron microscopy was useful for the study of viral antigens and antibodies. He was able to identify elusive viruses including rubella, hepatitis-associated antigens, rhinovirus, and coronavuus.",

Simultaneous nosocomial and community outbreaks of EKC with types 8 and 19 adenovirus were recently described. 10 In a recent epidemic of EKC at a Vietnamese refugee camp in Florida, adenovirus type 8 was recovered in 81% of cases cultured within two weeks of onset of infection.U Dawson et aP 2 described adenovirus-like particles in the conjunctiva of one patient and in the corneal epithelium of another by transmission electron microscopy of tissue culture preparations. They found that among 15 patients with EKC caused by adenovirus type 8, 2 had persistent corneal erosions during the acute stage of the disease, 7 had conjunctival scarring, and 9 had inflammatory membranes. An outbreak of adenovirus type 19 in the United States was described by Hierholzer and associates 13 and by Burns and Potter. 14 An epidemic of EKC caused by adenovirus type 19 occurred in London. 15 In this study, VOLUME Rfi adenovirus type 19 was isolated from 21 patients using human embryonic kidney cells. Another re-port16 described difficulties encountered in typing adenovirus related to types 10 to 19 in an outbreak of keratoconjunctivitis in Bristol. The same problem was encountered in this study, since the hybrid type [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] showed characteristics of type 10 determined by neutralization and of type 19 by hemagglutination inhibition.",

They used fluorescent antibody staining, examination of conjunctival cytology by the Giemsa and Papanicolaou stains, and standard virus isolations and antibody titers. They believed that virus culture was the most reliable way to identify adenoviral infections, since attempts at more rapid techniques using fluorescence antibody methods were unsuccessful. More recently, however, Vastine and asso-ciates18 used a direct immunofluorescence technique for the diagnosis of acute adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis with positive results in 25 patients with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. In an earlier report, Schwartz et aP 9 described positive immunofluorescence studies in all 39 patients with adenoviral isolation. The fluorescence staining was predominantly present in the cytoplasm, but speckled nuclear fluorescence was also noted.",

Thus, fluorescent antibody staining provides a more rapid and sensitive method for the detection of adenoviruses in infected conjunctival cells than viral culture, which usually requires one to eight weeks for virus identification. The direct immunofluorescent method is more rapid (requiring less than one hour) than the indirect technique, which takes a few hours to perform. Adequate controls are essential for the reliability of immunofluorescence and should be easier with the new commercial preserum conjugates. Frenkel and Piekarski2\u00b0 emphasized the problems in the diagnosis of Toxoplasma organisms and others by immunofluorescence with appropriate positive and negative controls. The present study showed a good relation of viral isolates to positive immunofluorescence; the latter was confirmed by culture.",

In keratoconjunctivitis caused by echovirus 7, associated gastrointestinal symptoms, fever, headache, and lymphadenopathy are present at an early stage, but conjunctival folliculosis was not reported. 22 The two main antigenic types of herpes virus hominis are type 1, commonly associated with infections of the eye, mouth, skin, and upper body, and type 2, associated with genital infections.
