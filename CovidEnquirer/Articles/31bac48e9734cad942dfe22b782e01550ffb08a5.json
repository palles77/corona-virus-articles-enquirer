A cross reactivity between Coronavirus (in particular SARS-CoV and OC43) must be considered when interpreting serological tests for Coronavirus [5] . Since the emergence in the 1990s of nucleic acid amplification-based techniques, especially PCR, the diagnosis of several viral agents causing pulmonary infections has greatly improved. The use of a multiplex PCR test for respiratory tract infection allows for a high rate of detection of etiological agents, and enables the detection of Coronavirus outbreaks [6] . Antiviral drugs are yet to be developed in the treatment of Coronavirus infections, but characterization of such severe infections in patients presenting with comorbidities or in immunocompromised patients could enhance the medical research. These outbreaks mainly occur when the temperature is low. However, Coronavirus OC43 outbreaks have been reported in tropical climates: Malaysia [7] and Brazil [8] in 2012-2013. The 2016 Southern Hemisphere's winter in Reunion Island was among the coldest of the last decade [9]. This could have induced a small increase in ICU admissions of elderly and frail patients.",
