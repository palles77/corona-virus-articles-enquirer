The most efficient means of viral transmission is the spread of infectious mucoid secretions to the fingers and hands and subsequently to the nose or eyes of a susceptible person [5] . Some viruses can be viable on the human skin for at least 2 hours, and one study found that certain viruses could be recovered from 40% to 90% of hands of persons who have colds [5] .

A scarlet rash may be seen with GAS infections, particularly in patients younger than 18 years [31] . It appears as tiny papules over the chest and abdomen, often described as sandpaper-like.

EBV is a widely disseminated herpesvirus that is spread by intimate contact between susceptible hosts and asymptomatic EBV shedders. Often called the ''kissing disease,'' EBV primarily spreads by way of the passage of saliva. The virus can persist in the oropharynx of patients who have a history of mono for up to 18 months after clinical recovery. Often, the illness can go undiagnosed if the symptoms are mild, but adolescents and young adults develop symptoms with higher frequency, ranging from 50% to 70% [45] . Although mono is generally a benign illness, splenic rupture is a known serious complication of mono, with an estimated occurrence of 1 to 2 cases per 1000 [46] . Almost all of the reported cases have occurred in male patients [45] . On occasion, splenic rupture is the first presenting symptom of mono, and it is spontaneous in over half of reported cases, with no history of impact or inciting injury [12] . Vital to the return-to-play decision, splenic rupture occurs primarily between the fourth and 21st day of symptomatic illness [45] .

One study of over 500 patients demonstrated that lymphadenopathy occurred in 100%, fever occurred in 98%, and pharyngitis occurred in 85% of documented cases [44] . Posterior cervical lymph nodes are characteristically more involved than anterior chains in mono, and these nodes may be large and moderately tender [44] . Lymphadenopathy peaks in the first week and gradually resolves over 2 to 3 weeks. The pharyngitis of mono is commonly described as exudative that may appear white, graygreen, or display necrotic features. Other findings include severe fatigue and splenomegaly. In a study of 631 Division I collegiate athletes, mean splenic size was 10.65 cm in length and 5.16 cm wide. Seven percent of the athletes' baseline spleen size met the current criteria for splenomegaly [47] . In this population, a single ultrasound evaluation of spleen size is of limited value, and clinical judgment may be more useful. Splenomegaly associated with mono occurs in 50% to 60% of patients and usually recedes by the third week of illness [48] .",

Corticosteroid and antiviral therapies have been studied in the treatment of mono. In a multicenter placebo-controlled trial of 94 patients who had acute mono, the combination of acyclovir and prednisolone reduced oropharygeal shedding of the virus but did not affect the duration of symptoms or lead to earlier return to school or work [50] .
