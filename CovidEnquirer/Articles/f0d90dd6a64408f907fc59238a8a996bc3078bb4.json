Data on medical waste generation at 150 health care establishments were collected for analysis in 2003. General medical waste and infectious waste production at these establishments were examined statistically with the potential associated factors. These factors included the types of hospital and clinic, reimbursement payment by National Health Insurance, total number of beds, bed occupancy, number of infectious disease beds and outpatients per day. The average waste generation rates ranged from 2.41 to 3.26 kg/bed/day for general medical wastes, and 0.19-0.88 kg/bed/day for infectious wastes. The total average quantity of infectious wastes generated was the highest from medical centers, or 3.8 times higher than that from regional hospitals (267.8 vs. 70.3 Tons/ yr). The multivariate regression analysis was able to explain 92% of infectious wastes and 64% of general medical wastes, with the amount of insurance reimbursement and number of beds as significant prediction factors. This study suggests that large hospitals are the major source of medical waste in Taiwan. The fractions of medical waste treated as infectious at all levels of healthcare establishments are much greater than that recommended by the USCDC guidelines.",

In Taiwan, the total amount of medical waste was estimated to increase from 61,343 Tons in 2002 to 117,544 Tons in 2004, including 10,943 and 22,326 Tons of hazardous waste, respectively (TEPA, 2004 (TEPA, , 2006 . There are proven techniques for the medical industry to provide safe and proper medical waste treatment (Malkan and Nelson, 2005; Diaz et al., 2005) . The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 has called for the authorities to take more serious steps in man-aging medical waste. During that period, most of the waste produced from urgent and intensive medical care was classified as infectious. The procedures for handling, treatment and disposal of this waste were required to comply with the most stringent standards (Chiang et al., 2006) . The health authority in Taiwan was alerted to re-examine the current status of waste production for further management planning. The types of medical establishments and the waste management capacity at hospitals have been recognized as important factors in waste treatment. Studies have reported that the quantity of waste generated by hospitals varied by changes in local legislation (Askarian et al., 2004; Fisher, 2005; Mohee, 2005; Bdour et al., 2007) . Studies have also discussed the opportunities for waste reduction through better management practices for both infectious and general wastes (Almuneef and Memish, 2003; Tudor et al., 2005) . For better knowledge of medical waste generation and management, we conducted a survey to investi- gate the types and quantities of medical waste generated from healthcare related establishments in Taiwan. The quantities of medical waste produced were evaluated using selected factors.",

The medical establishment applies to the Bureau of NHI for services reimbursement by the official fee schedule. As of the end of 2003, over 96% of the population was enrolled in the NHI program. The Department of Health in Taiwan has categorized approximately 18,700 medical establishments into four levels: medical centers, regional hospitals, local (community) hospitals, and independent clinics and others (including dental clinics, psychiatric treatment facilities, institutions for training and special functions, long-term care centers, postnatal care centers, and care centers for the elderly) (BNHI, 2004) .",

Data analysis measured the potential factors associated with the amount of waste production, such as the capacity of services and the medical specialties provided by the medical establishment. It has been statistically justified that the type of medical establishment affects the production of infectious and general waste. Multiple variable regression analysis was applied to predict the factors associated with waste generation. The amount of infectious waste and the number of inpatients can be associated with the total number of beds and bed occupancy. Reimbursement from the NHI to individual medical establishments could be an interesting indicator reflecting the capacity of services provided. Therefore, factors including NHI payment, total number of beds, rate of bed occupancy, number of beds for infectious diseases, number of outpatients per day and amount of waste recycled (in Tons) were included in the multivariate model to examine their association with waste production.",

The larger hospital has greater capacity to provide infectious disease care and more effective waste management. Therefore, NHI payment and total number of beds were significant variables in predicting the amount of infectious wastes. Although, this may not be a direct association, the increase of every 0.1 billion NT dollars in NHI reimbursement reflected an increase of 8 Tons of annual infectious waste generation (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, NHI payment was not a significant factor to predict the general waste production rate (p = 0.22).

However, surgery remains the unit with the highest production rate per day per bed. To our knowledge, the prevalence of end stage renal disease requiring diagnosis in Taiwan is rather high (BNHI, 2004) . In comparison, regional hospitals have become important establishments to provide patients with dialysis services. Dialysis is a medical specialty using a large amount of disposable materials in the care process, which rapidly increases the amount of waste (Shaprio et al., 2003) .",

We are not sure there was a residual effect of up-regulation of waste management during the SARS chaos. We noted that there was a great increase in infectious waste in most medical establishments because of reduced recycling practice and the irrational reaction of society during the SARS epidemic. The increased infectious wastes were associated with eliminated segregation and segregation errors in line with precautions.

To our knowledge, they also possess better leverage to negotiate with the medical waste collectors to handle the recyclable materials.
