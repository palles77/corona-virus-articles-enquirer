The burden of stroke is particularly heavy in Asia, where it accounts for more than half of worldwide mortality from stroke. Acute intervention for ischaemic stroke is currently the subject of intensive clinical research. Among medical treatments, aspirin 1,2 and tissue plasminogen activator [3] [4] [5] have been shown to have a benefi cial eff ect on outcome. However, the treatment eff ect of aspirin is small, and use of tissue plasminogen activator is limited by its narrow therapeutic window. 6 Antithrombotic agents are used in acute ischaemic stroke to inhibit clot propagation, prevent reembolisation, and facilitate clot lysis. 7, 8 However, randomised controlled trials have not found unfractionated heparin to be eff ective in improving functional outcome. 2 Several medium-sized randomised placebo-controlled trials using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or heparinoid for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke have been reported since 1995. [9] [10] [11] [12] Only the Fraxiparine in Ischaemic Stroke (FISS) study of nadroparin calcium in 312 Chinese patients was positive in its primary outcome, 9 but this result was not reproduced in the larger FISS-bis study, 10 the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST), 11 nor the Tinzaparin in Acute Ischemic Stroke Trial (TAIST) study. 12 Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of LMWH and heparinoids in acute ischaemic stroke have concluded that immediate fulldose anticoagulant therapy is not associated with net short-term or long-term benefi t, and the routine use of any type of anticoagulant is not supported. 13, 14 However, debate has continued in Asia on whether the results of the FISS study, the only positive trial of LMWH, were due to chance or related to ethnic diff erences in the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of ischaemic stroke.",

By contrast, intracranial large artery occlusive disease (LAOD) is an important cause of stroke among Asians, Hispanics, and African Americans. [15] [16] [17] Asian data have suggested that LAOD is the cause of ischaemic stroke in about a third to a half of patients. 18, 19 The predominance of intracranial LAOD in Asian stroke patients might explain why the benefi cial eff ect of LMWH in Chinese patients was not reproduced in studies of white people. In concordance with this hypothesis, a post-hoc analysis of the TOAST study has shown that heparinoid treatment could increase the odds of a favourable outcome in patients with stroke secondary to LAOD. 20 With this background of a positive trial and defi nite diff erences in stroke subtype, especially intracranial atherosclerosis in Asians, uncertainty remains about the benefi t of LMWH for LAOD. The study objective was to test the hypothesis that subcutaneous nadroparin calcium is superior to aspirin in improving stroke outcome at 6 months in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and LAOD.",

            "text": "This trial was designed to assess the eff ects of LMWH versus aspirin on acute stroke patients with LAOD (predominantly due to intracranial atherosclerosis). Ischaemic stroke is a heterogeneous disease with three main stroke subtypes: cardioembolic, LAOD, and small vessel disease. Because of the diversity of stroke mechanisms, the best acute treatment of individual stroke subtypes may be diff erent. Previous acute trials of anticoagulation have not systematically targeted underlying arterial lesions. 23 In patients with LAOD, atherothrombosis is a common mechanism and thus anticoagulation may be particularly useful in this stroke subtype. A previous post-hoc analysis suggested that anticoagulation may be benefi cial among patients with internal carotid occlusive disease. 20 Among acute stroke patients with intracranial atherosclerosis, microemboli were detected in 30% of patients by use of transcranial doppler monitoring, and 50% of patients had multiple acute infarcts on diff usion-weighted MRI, suggesting artery-to-artery embolism was an important stroke mechanism in patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis. 24 Although our data did not show a defi nitive benefi t of LMWH over aspirin, the results were compatible with an earlier study on Asian patients who were at high risk of intracranial atherosclerosis. 9 Moreover, the results also suggested that LMWH might be hazardous in patients without LAOD. Future large studies of anticoagulation on acute stroke patients with LAOD should be done to clarify the role of anticoagulation in diff erent stroke subtypes. The choice of primary outcome measure is crucial in the case of acute stroke. The Barthel index was used in this study and is the most commonly used disability measure in acute stroke trials. 25, 26 However, the Barthel index is a not sensitive measure among patients with relatively mild stroke. 27 The stroke severity of our patients was relatively mild: the median Barthel index score was 100 and 71% of patients had a score of at least 85 at 6 months. Several recent studies have used a dichotomised mRS score or combined several outcome measures in a global statistical test. 28 The choice of primary outcome measure may determine whether a trial is positive or negative. 5 Future studies on patients with intracranial atherosclerosis may consider using a dichotomised mRS score as the primary outcome measure.",

Patients without physical impairment but who are cognitively impaired may need help for their daily functions. The diff erence in cognitive outcome might explain the diff erences in disability status, although there was no diff erence in the NIHSS scores (a measure of physical impairment). However, the diff erences could also indicate small diff erences in the baseline MMSE in the groups. Our data suggest that future acute stroke trials should measure cognitive function as an outcome indicator.",

The use of (predominantly) ultrasound to delineate vascular lesion also strengthens the methodology of this study. However, use of open-label trial medication might have caused bias, even though the assessors at month 6 were unaware of treatment allocation. The use of the last observation carried forward method could introduce substantial bias. In addition, the relatively small sample size could provide misleading conclusions on possible benefi t or hazard. However, the eff ect would be small in our analysis because there were only about 2% of missing data in our study. Nevertheless, the results of this study should resurrect interest in large clinical trials on anticoagulation in acute ischaemic stroke patients with LAOD, especially intracranial disease.",
