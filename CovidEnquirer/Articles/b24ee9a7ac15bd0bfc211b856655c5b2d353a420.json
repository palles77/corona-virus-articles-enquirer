From October 2009 to January 2011, we conducted a prospective study in hospitalized children from whom samples were taken for the detection of respiratory viruses. Clinical, epidemiological and microbiological data from 644 patients with 904 disease episodes were collected. When HRV tested positive, strains were further characterized by sequencing the VP4/VP2 region of the HRV genome. HRV was the single respiratory virus detected in 254 disease episodes (28%). Overall, 99 different serotypes were detected (47% HRV-A, 12% HRV-B, 39% HRV-C). Patients with HRV had more underlying pulmonary illness compared with patients with no virus (p 0.01), or patients with another respiratory virus besides HRV (p 0.007). Furthermore, cough, shortness of breath and a need for oxygen were significantly more present in patients with HRV infection. Particularly, patients with HRV-B required extra oxygen. No respiratory symptom, except for oxygen need, was predictive of the presence of HRV. In 22% of HRV-positive disease episodes, HRV infection was hospital acquired. Phylogenetic analysis revealed several clusters of HRV; in more than 25% of these clusters epidemiological information was suggestive of transmission within specific wards. In conclusion, the detection of HRV may help in explaining respiratory illness, particular in patients with pulmonary co-morbidities.",

The development of sensitive and rapid molecular techniques markedly improved the detection rate of HRV and revealed the high genetic diversity. Over 150 serotypes of HRV have been described, classified into three main species: HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C [4] . HRV-C is the most recently discovered species and is thought to contribute more to recurrent wheezing and exacerbations of asthma compared with HRV-A and HRV-B [1, 5] . Also, recently published data suggest that HRV-A and HRV-C cause more severe illness than HRV-B, with the greatest virulence during the winter [6] . Currently, molecular diagnostics are increasingly integrated into routine practice, allowing detection and quantification of HRV, and also raising questions about their value in direct patient care and infection control. We performed a hospitalbased prospective study to determine the clinical, epidemiological and viral characteristics associated with HRV infection in children.",

For rhinovirus detection, a real-time LDT-PCR was introduced using the SuperScript \u00e2 III Platinum \u00e2 One-Step qRT-PCR Kit, (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All reactions were performed with Phocine Distemper Virus as an internal control in a total volume of 25 lL containing 12.5 lL of 29 reactionmix, 0.5 lL SuperScript \u00e2 III RT/Platinum \u00e2 Taq mix, 0.5 lL of 1:10 Rox reference dye, 300 nM of each forward primer, 600 nM reverse primer and 100 nM of each probe, and 5 lL of genomic RNA template. Primers and probes used are listed in Table 1 . The addition of this large set of primers and probes is performed in a specific reaction to avoid bias and favouring against other respiratory viruses. Our rhinovirus PCR has been optimized during recent years based on the available genetic information, in particular regarding species C. By reoptimizing the assay with new primers and probes, together with the use of Invitrogen SuperScript enzymes, we detected retrospectively more HRV-positive samples at a lower cycle threshold (Ct) value. To ensure that these HRVs were not enteroviruses, all samples were sequenced. We only detected HRV, eventually 99 serotypes, as well as enterovirus 68, which is genetically identical to HRV.",

Also, high nosocomial infection rates were observed. HRV infection was associated with substantial respiratory illness, especially among children with pre-existing pulmonary disease. Although the association of HRV with asthma has been well established in recent years, the occurrence of HRV infections in our study was associated with chronic respiratory illness in general [5, 10, 11] . Whether these children are more vulnerable to the acquisition of HRV, or whether they have more symptomatic illness related to HRV, remains to be elucidated. In patients with a chronic respiratory condition, only the need for oxygen was predictive for HRV; cough and shortness of breath were not only associated with the detection of HRV, but also with the detection of other respiratory viruses. Thus, respiratory symptoms alone are not sufficient to predict the presence of an HRV infection.",

Although a positive relationship between a higher viral load and more (serious) respiratory symptoms has been reported, others were not able to reproduce these findings [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Adequate quantification of HRV in respiratory samples is currently limited by several factors, as addressed in recent reports [16, 17] . One major limitation is the lack of a reference standard for the quantification of all HRV types. Secondly, HRV viral load is affected by the sample type and the method of collection and detection [18] . Thus, although in our study no relationship between the relative amount of virus (expressed as Ct value) and the presence of clinical symptoms could be demonstrated, the interpretation of the Ct value in relation to severity of illness remains to be determined and is probably, with the current limitations in quantification of HRV, hardly feasible.",

This might be explained by concerns over getting a bacterial co-infection. Indeed, antibiotic use was associated with submission of samples for bacteriological culture, assuming a suspicion of bacterial infection in those patients. However, although bacteria known to cause (secondary) respiratory infections in infants were more frequently cultured in patients with a respiratory viral infection compared with patients with no viral infection (H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae), the outcome of the bacteriological cultures did not influence the use of antibiotics. Because the collection of samples for bacteriological culture was not standardized, but dependent on the judgement of the clinician, and carried out in only a minority of patients, these results might have been biased and more studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

In our population, species HRV-A and HRV-C were detected in equal amounts, and dominated over HRV-B. We observed no species-specific pattern of clinical illness, except that HRV-B was associated with a higher need for oxygen. Besides, patients with HRV-A and HRV-B had to stay in the hospital significantly longer than patients with HRV-C. Until now, studies that addressed the relationship between species and severity of illness reported HRV-B as being the least virulent compared with HRV-A and HRV-C [6, 17] . However, recently, Miller et al. also showed that patients with HRV-B were more likely to require supplemental oxygen and had a longer duration of stay in the hospital [19] . Also, patients with HRV-B tended to have higher disease severity scores. The reason for the different observations regarding HRV-B-associated severity of illness is not clear. Our study and the study of Miller et al. included hospitalized children, whereas in a recent study by Lee et al., who showed a clear distinction in severity of illness between HRV-A/C and HRV-B, the majority of patients were not admitted to the hospital [6] . Also, we observed a tendency for more chronic respiratory illness in patients with an HRV-B infection, possibly explaining the higher need for oxygen. These findings may suggest that HRV-B is associated with either asymptomatic carriage or mild respiratory disease, and that host factors such as pre-existing pulmonary disease contribute to more serious, symptomatic respiratory illness caused by HRV-B.",

Phylogenetic analysis revealed several clusters of HRV with identical sequences; in more than 25% of these clusters epidemiological information was suggestive of transmission of the virus on specific wards. Although HRV-B is the least frequently found species in our study, almost 40% of HRV-B infections are acquired in the hospital. This suggests that the hospital environment is for some reason more favourable for transmission of HRV-B. Also, if HRV-B is indeed associated with asymptomatic carriage or mild respiratory disease, this would facilitate transmission within the hospital, only causing clear respiratory symptoms in patients with pre-existing pulmonary illness.",

Transmission mainly occurs via droplets or contact and although measures to prevent transmission were taken the moment HRV was detected in respiratory samples, infectiousness is probably highest in the early stages of disease, before the outcome of diagnostic tests is available and thus before infection control measures were taken. These findings advocate the implementation of infection control measures driven by the presence of respiratory symptoms instead of the outcome of a laboratory test. However, further investigations are needed to determine the contribution of healthcare workers, other patients and visitors in nosocomial transmission of HRV.",

Being a tertiary referral hospital could have biased our findings towards more serious illness, as is reflected by the characteristics of the included patients: more than 50% of the children had a chronic underlying illness, and even in the ones that had no respiratory virus detected, signs and symptoms of serious illness were present (e.g. mechanical ventilation). Furthermore, information on bacterial co-infection was based on cultures taken just around the time the viral sample was taken. Information on the presence of bacterial pathogens outside this timeframe was not included. Also, we had no information about the presence of so-called atypical bacterial pathogens (e.g Mycoplasma or Chlamydophila). However, given the high prevalence of HRV infection in our study population and the expected low prevalence of atypical pathogens, we assume that this limitation does not influence the main conclusions of our study [20, 21] .",

Nosocomial infection occurs frequently. Most notably, HRV species B may have features that facilitate transmission within the hospital. Although antiviral therapy is not yet available for patients infected with HRV, the detection and identification of these viruses could help in explaining respiratory illness. Also, identifying HRV provides opportunities for implementing timely and accurate infection control measures to prevent further transmission. Our study illustrates the value of sequence analysis not only in gaining insight into the genetic diversity of rhinoviruses, but also as a tool in defining transmission routes within the hospital and in the detection of sources of nosocomial infection.",
