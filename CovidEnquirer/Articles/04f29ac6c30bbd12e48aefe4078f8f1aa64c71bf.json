The conserved target sequences directed to classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) were selected based on alignments of genomic sequences and then specific primers were designed. The mRT-PCR assay was developed and evaluated for its specificity and sensitivity. The expected product from the single viral template was amplified by mRT-PCR and no spurious PCR amplification occurred from the genomic RNA or DNA of other pathogens. For single virus or different combinations of two viruses the detection limit of mRT-PCR was consistent with a single RT-PCR wtith 1 \u00d7 10 3 copies. For different combinations of the three viruses or four viruses, sensitivity of PEDV detection partially decreased. All of positive clinical specimens by the mRT-PCR were identically confirmed using Taqman RT-qPCR. Therefore, the mRT-PCR is a useful tool for epidemiological studies and laboratory diagnosis of single virus and/or mixed infections in swine.",

Under typical conditions of intensive swine production, it is ordinary for swine to be simultaneously infected with two or more viral pathogens (Hu et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2011) . Multiple infections lead to atypical clinical signs. For instance, CSFV and PRRSV cause respiratory failure or abortions and/or stillbirths in pigs which can be easily confused (Lim et al., 2016; Young et al., 2010) . Similarly, signs of the PEDV infection were clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from those caused by TGEV (Ducatelle et al., 1982; Haelterman, 1972) . Usually, viral isolation based on cell culture is the standard laboratory methods for diagnosis of viral diseases (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Terpstra and Wensvoort, 1988) , but is time consuming and complicated. When clinical signs can be variable and may not be pathogen-specific, a number of costly virus-specific tests are performed to diagnose accurately viral pathogens. Therefore, development of rapid and simultaneous detection assay for diagnosis of swine virus pathogens is important and urgent.",

Diagnosis of virus infection is typically accomplished by viral isolation followed by immunostaining analysis and serological methods. However, viral isolation is complex, labor intensive and time-consuming. Serological methods have low specificity and/or sensitivity. Nucleic acid detection, particularly based on PCR/ RT-PCR, has expanded exponentially in recent years. By simultaneously amplifying more than one target in the same reaction, multiplex PCR increasingly is used as a rapid and convenient assay in the clinical diagnosis (Henegariu et al., 1997; Hu et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2013) . In this study, we developed a multiplex RT-PCR assay for simultaneously detecting four viral pathogens in clinical specimens. Compared to a single RT-PCR or RT-qPCR, mRT-PCR is a rapid, convenient and effective assay and is more advantageous to detect clinically mixed infection.",

Sensitivity of any PCR depends on multitude of factors including efficiency of the primer, reaction conditions and components (Elnifro et al., 2000; Reid et al., 1998) . mRT-PCR contained multiple primer pairs in the same PCR reaction. Ideally, the primer pairs should enable similar amplification efficiencies for their respective targets and be not complementary for earh other, particularly at their 3\u2032 ends (Cha and Thilly, 1993; Dieffenbach et al., 1993; Henegariu et al., 1997) . Here, we optimizedly designed specific primers with G + C content of 42-62% and nearly identical annealing temperatures (58-61\u00b0C) for mRT-PCR (Table 1) . Our results demonstrated that the amplified products in a single reaction could be easily differentiated on the basis of size and that no significant mispriming to any template or dimers occurred. Sensitivity of mRT-PCR is identical to a single RT-PCR for each virus or different combinations of two viruses. When three or four viruses existed in same reaction, sensitivity of mRT-PCR for PEDV detection decreased significantly compared to a single RT-PCR.",
