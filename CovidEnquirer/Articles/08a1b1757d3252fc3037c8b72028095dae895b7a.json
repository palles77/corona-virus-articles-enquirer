Acquisition of Streptococcus pneumoniae during Hajj has been studied in the past and recommendations for vaccination against S. pneumoniae have been made for high risk groups. Methods: The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes of French Hajj pilgrims towards pneumococcal vaccination. Adult pilgrims departing from Marseille, France to Mecca for the 2014 Hajj season were administered a face-to-face questionnaire to ascertain their knowledge and attitudes towards pneumococcal vaccination before departing for Hajj. Results: A total of 300 participants took part. Their overall knowledge about the severity of pneumonia and the existence of the vaccine was very low. Out of 101 participants who had an indication for pneumococcal vaccination, irrespective of their travel status, only 7% were advised to have the vaccine by their general practitioner. Conclusions: These results reinforce the need for better dissemination of information either before or during the pre-travel counselling.

Pneumonia is the leading cause of hospitalization and intensive care unit admissions during the Hajj [2] . Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 37% of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia during the Hajj in Saudi hospitals [3] . Attack rates of respiratory symptoms among French Hajj pilgrims have been shown to be as high as 90% [4] . Nasal carriage of S. pneumoniae among French Hajj pilgrims, as reported in 2012, was 20% before leaving the KSA as opposed to 7% before departing from France [5] . In 2013, 62% of the French Hajj pilgrims tested positive for S. pneumoniae in throat samples following participation to the Hajj and 36.3% of them had acquired the infection during their stay in KSA [4] . Evidence for the importance of pneumococcal disease at the Hajj is summarized in Table 1 .",

In addition, 79% of the participants were either obese or over-weight.

Sex was evenly distributed between those having risk factors and those not having risk factors for pneumococcal diseases (p > 0.05). Age was unevenly distributed between the two groups (p < 10 \u00c03 ) with the risk group having a higher mean age of 65.7 years (95% CI 64.5e67.1) than the not-at-risk group of 45.2 (95% CI 43.0e47.4).",

However, when multinomial logistic regression was performed with age group below and above 65 years as one of the covariates, the differences became insignificant for two of those questions.

An estimated one third of Hajj pilgrims are at risk of pneumococcal disease either by virtue of age or pre-existing medical conditions and consideration should be given to vaccinating high risk pilgrims against pneumococcal disease [2] . The new generation of conjugate vaccine has proven effective in the prevention of severe pneumococcal disease. It is well tolerated. Local reactions tend to be mild and short lived [2] . Data on the preventive effect of pneumococcal vaccination in the context of Hajj is lacking, and further epidemiological research is needed to assess the likely benefit of vaccinating Hajj pilgrims against pneumococcal disease and to allow Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health to issue appropriate recommendations regarding health interventions for Hajj pilgrims [8] .",
