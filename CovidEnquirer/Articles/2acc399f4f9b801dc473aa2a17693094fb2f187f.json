Their high sensitivity, short turnaround time and ability to simultaneously detect and quantify multiple RNA and DNA viruses in small clinical samples have made them the gold standard for diagnosing and monitoring viral infections [1] [2] [3] [4] . Nevertheless, performance also depends partly on the amount and quality of extracted nucleic acids (NA). Poor extraction or incomplete removal of inhibitory molecules can significantly undermine the reliability of molecular diagnosis. Initially done by centrifugation or chemical separation, extraction is now mainly based on NA adsorption to silica in the presence of chaotropic salts such as sodium iodide, guanidine thiocyanate or guanidine hydrochloride, followed by elution with low-salt buffer or water [5] [6] [7] [8] . This silica-based technology, notably improved by Boom and colleagues, allowed the NA isolation procedure to be automated, ensuring better standardization and reproducibility [9] .",

NucliSENS \u00ae easyMAG \u00ae limited manual extraction steps (particularly washing) and could simultaneously extract up to 24 clinical specimens in one hour. Its performance on clinical whole blood, sputum, serum and throat swab specimens, and on quality controls for molecular diagnostics, was considered similar to or better than that of other manual and automated NA extraction platforms [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . However, the extraction procedure was not fully automated: sample loading, homogenization of the lysed sample with silica, and recovery of eluted NA at the end of the process, all required human intervention. The third generation of the NucliSENS \u00ae miniMAG \u00ae and easyMAG \u00ae family, to be available in the last quarter of 2016, has been designed to fill these gaps. Based on the same extraction technology and using the same reagents and disposables as NucliSENS \u00ae easyMAG \u00ae , eMAG TM offers a significant gain in terms of automation, allowing simultaneous extraction of 48 samples directly from primary tubes, and distribution of NA extracts in PCR strips or tubes. It was first necessary to show that this gain in practicability did not undermine viral NA extraction performance by comparison with NucliSENS \u00ae easyMAG \u00ae .",

Two hundred ninety-nine residual discard clinical samples submitted to the virology and mycobacteriology department for virological diagnosis from January 2014 to June 2016 were retrospectively selected for this evaluation. They consisted of respiratory samples (n = 199), whole blood (n = 50), EDTA plasma (n = 25) and urine (n = 25) specimens described in the next paragraph. All the samples had prospectively tested positive for at least one virus at the time of diagnosis, as part of standard-of-care orders by clinicians, and had then been stored at \u221280 \u2022 C. Their minimal volume was 400 L, allowing simultaneous extraction of identical volumes (200 L) on the NucliSENS \u00ae easyMAG \u00ae and eMAG TM instruments, prior to realtime PCR and RT-PCR. The nucleic acids extracted from a given sample on the two platforms were amplified in the same run. The same thermocycler was used throughout the study. The samples were only tested for the initially diagnosed virus. Testing of respiratory samples also included cell control detection.

The results were assessed for qualitative targets consisting of respiratory viruses, in both single-virus and mixed viral samples (plus cell control detection), as well as quantitative targets, represented by CMV, EBV, HHV6 and BKV viral load. We found good agreement on qualitative results, ranging from 84.6% for whole blood to 95.9% for respiratory samples. Fourteen false-negative results were assessed following eMAG TM extraction of 9 respiratory samples and 5 whole blood specimens (1 CMV, 1 EBV and 3 HHV6). However, based on the equal number of false-negatives between the two platforms as well as on the Ct values of the discrepant results, most of the time higher than 35 cycles, it is very likely that there is no difference in extraction efficiency between easyMAG \u00ae and eMAG TM and that the discrepant results reflected target-load of the samples around the limit of detection leading to a stochastical chance on detection. Regarding the clinical relevance of the missed positive samples, they involved respiratory viruses other than influenza and thus would not have led to a delay or lack of treatment by neuraminidase inhibitor. For herpesviruses, the viral loads were low, with Ct values >37 Ct, and would likely have had no effect on therapeutic management in closely monitored patients.",

These results allowed us to conclude that, in our hands, the two platforms have comparable performance, whether on respiratory, whole blood, plasma or urine specimens.",

Interestingly, the mean CMV, EBV and HHV6 viral loads measured in whole blood all favored eMAG TM (0.10 log 10 copies/mL). This suggests more efficient DNA extraction from whole blood with eMAG TM than with easyMAG \u00ae ; indeed, by comparison with other specimens, whole blood sample extraction is reported to require a larger volume of silica and lysis buffer on the easyMAG \u00ae platform [14] . This finding must, however, be confirmed in further studies using a larger number of whole blood samples.",

            "text": "The new eMAG TM platform uses the same reagents, disposables and protocols (specific B in our study) as easyMAG \u00ae , but it is far more practical. The eMAG TM manages NA extraction directly from primary sample tubes (from 1.5 to 14 mL), thereby avoiding the need for manual distribution in sample vessels, which is timeconsuming and a source of error. It is then to take into account a dead volume of 50-245 L, depending on the size and shape of the input tube, and this may be an issue with precious clinical samples such as cerebrospinal fluid and aqueous humor. Note that manual sample loading is still possible, even in tandem with automated loading in the same run. The eMAG TM also automatically distributes the internal control (IC2), which is necessary to check the extraction process and the absence of amplification inhibitors in the sample, and silica limiting again here hands-on time. Higher degree of automation of sample and reagent distribution would suppose a lower level of inter-run variation that was, however, not evaluated in the present work since the cell control does not allow this analysis and there are too few data with IC2. Finally, NA eluate transfer is possible in output tubes consisting of individual PCR tubes or strips from 0.2 to 2 mL. This new platform is thus likely to significantly reduce the sample processing time for PCR analysis, to improve the standardization and traceability of sample extraction, and to limit the risk of error through automatic distribution of clinical sam-ples and reagents. However, it is noteworthy that extraction of one whole blood sample was invalidated on the eMAG TM platform during our study, because a precipitate formed when silica was added to the lysis buffer containing the specimen, preventing further sample handling by the instrument and leading to a system error. With the easyMAG \u00ae platform, the manual homogenization step allowed us to resuspend the precipitate, thereby enabling sample extraction. A similar issue might arise during automatic collection from a primary tube containing a non-homogeneous clinical sample such as viscous respiratory secretions or a blood sample containing a clot. It might be advisable to systematically transfer certain samples, such as bone marrow or distal respiratory specimens, to a secondary tube in order to ensure fluidity before positioning on the eMAG TM instrument. Extraction throughput is doubled with eMAG TM compared to easyMAG \u00ae , as the eMAG TM platform consists of two independent sections each harboring 24 reactions, for a total of 48 simultaneous extractions. This makes eMAG TM advantageous for laboratories analyzing a large number of samples each day. Extraction takes 2 h with eMAG TM , compared to about one hour with easyMAG \u00ae , but as eMAG TM is fully automated, working time can be spent on other tasks.",
