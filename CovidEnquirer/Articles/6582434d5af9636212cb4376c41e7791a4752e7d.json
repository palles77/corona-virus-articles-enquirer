Yet the notoriety and abundance of RNA viruses attests to their great success as intracellular parasites. Indeed some estimates suggest that 80% of viruses have RNA genomes. It follows that replication without proofreading can be a successful strategy. There is a price to pay, however. Manfred Eigen was the first to point out that without proofreading there is a limit on the size of RNA genomes. Obviously, if the mutation rate is too high, any RNA virus will collapse under mutation pressure. As it happens, RNA viral genomes are up to 32 kb long while mutation rates are 1-2 per genome per cycle or less.",

Hence there would be no loss of fitness, fixed mutations being neutral. A corollary of this would be that the intrinsic life style of a virus is set in its genes. The alternative is to suppose that most fixed mutations are beneficial to the virus in allowing it to keep ahead of the host and/or host population. By this token variation is an integral part of the viral modus vivendi. The twin requirements of a successful virus are replication and transmission. Under the rubric replication, a virus could vary to increase its fitness, exploit different target cells or evade adaptive immune responses. In terms of transmission, variation might allow a virus to overcome herd immunity.",

Purifying or negative selection is ever operative -a poor replicon invariably goes asunder. Through rounds of error and trial, positive selection is the only means of creating a novel replicon. So long as the ecological niche occupied doesn't change, the virus doesn't need to change, purifying selection being sufficient to ensure existence. This raises an important issue: we know that, over the time that we are living and loving, as well as doing experiments, writing papers and reviewing, humans are not evolving. Ernst Mayr noted that \"the brain of 100 000 years ago is the same brain that is now able to design computers\" (Mayr, 1997) . Positive fitness selection among mammals is effectively inoperative over our lifetimes. And certainly since we have known about HIV and AIDS.",

Although there has been intense debate as to what molecular clocks mean and quite how far they deviate from null hypotheses, fibronectin fixes mutations faster than alpha-or beta-globin, which do so faster than cytochrome c, etc. Rates of amino acid fixation are intrinsic to different proteins. Yet some viruses give rise to persistent infections, others to sequential acute infections. All succumb to the vagaries of transmission bottlenecks. How many rounds of infection are necessary to fix mutations? For example, the tremendous dynamics of viral replication have been described. Whether it be HIV, HBV or HCV, plasma viral turnover is of the order of 108-10 '2 virions per day (Ho et al., 1995; Wei et al., 1995; Nowak et al., 1996; Zeuzem et al., 1998) . Between 10% and 90% of plasma virus is cleared. In the case of HIV this can involve more than 200 rounds of sequential replication per year (Wain-Hobson, 1993a,b; Ho et al., 1995; Pelletier et al., 1995; Wei et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "Many of these variables and unknowns can be removed by comparing the fixation of aminoacid substitutions in pairs of viral proteins from two genomes. If one assumes that the two gene fragments remain linked, through the hellfire of Ay immune responses and bottlenecking inherent in transmission, relative degrees of fixation should be attainable. Note that, so long as frequent recombination between highly divergent genomes is not in evidence, this assumption should be valid. This procedure is outlined in Figure 6 .1. The first example is taken from the vast primate immunodeficiency virus database (LANL, 1998) . When normalized to the p66 reverse transcriptase product designated RT, amino acid sequence divergence for p17 Gag, p24 Gag, integrase, Vif, gp120, the ectodomain of gp41 and Nef all reveal highly significant linear relationships ( Figure 6 .2, Table 6 .1). The relative rates vary by a factor of two or more. Why the hypervariable gp120 protein shows a relatively low degree of change with respect to the reverse (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1993) . It is well established that protein sequence comparisons are more informative when weighted for genetic and structural biases in amino acid replacements. In the Blosum weight matrices series, the actual matrix that was used depends on how similar the sequences to be aligned are. Different matrices work differently at each evolutionary distance. For a given virus, different protein sequence sets were compared to a given reference such as RT in the case of HIV/SIV. n indicates the number of independent two-by-two comparisons. The data were checked for the possibility that a rogue genome strongly influenced the data. Only in the case of the Inoviridae were there insufficient complete sequences, six in fact, to yield satisfying analyses. Instead all pairwise comparisons were made, hence the data points reflect dependent data (#). The form of the linear regressions are given where y and x refer to the first and second protein listed in the column \"Paired proteins\". The correlation coefficients r were highly significant in all cases, the corresponding probabilities being: + < 0.02;\" < 0.005; *< 0.001. .2 Graphical representation of paired divergence for orthologous proteins taken from complete HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV genome sequences, y = different proteins, x = p66 sequence of the reverse transcriptase (RT). x and y values correspond to Blosum-corrected fractional divergence. Only non-overlapping regions were taken into account. The straight lines were obtained by linear regression analysis. Their characteristics are given in Table 6 .1. transcriptase (RT) can be explained by gap stripping, which eliminates the hypervariable regions. Consequently the gp120 data effectively reflects the conserved regions. The linearity, even out to considerable differences, indicates that multiple substitutions and back mutations, which must be occurring, do so to comparable degrees. Although these data were derived from completely sequenced primate immunodeficiency viral genomes, analyses on larger data sets, such as p17 Gag/p24 Gag or gp120/gp41, yielded relative values that differed from those given in Table 6 .1 by at most 14%. The absence of points far from the linear regression substan-tiates the assumption that recombination between highly divergent genomes is rare. This does not preclude recombination between closely related genomes. The linear regressions passed close to the origin in nearly all cases. Only for Nef was there some deviation, suggesting that Nef was saturating to a different extent from all other proteins. However, as linear correlations involving Nef data were always statistically significant, this trend may be fortuitous. Note that the data cover the earliest phase, intrapatient variation (generally <10%), continuing smoothly to cover interclade, intertype and finally interspecies comparisons. Yet this in spite of different environments-that of an individual's immune system, different immune systems stigmatized by highly polymorphic HLA, and finally differences between humans, chimpanzees, mandrills and African green monkeys accumulated over 30 million years. The same forces were uppermost during all stages of diversification. It is remarkable that the very different proteins, such as gp120 and the gp41 ectodomain (surface glycoproteins), p17 Gag and p24 Gag (structural), RT and integrase (enzymes) and Nef and Vif (cytoplasmic), all yield linear relationships ( Figure 6 .2), as though fixation was an intrinsic property of the protein.",

Although insects do not mount adaptive immune responses, the breadth and complexity of their innate immune systems is salutary (Brey and Hultmark, 1998) .

Such proteins are vastly different in their threedimensional folds and functions. Some are \"seen\" by humoral immunity, others are not. For the plant viruses and bacteriophages, only innate immunity is operative. It is as though the rate of amino acid sequence accumulation is an intrinsic feature of the protein, reminiscent of the differing slopes for the accumulation of substitutions by alpha-globin and cytochrome c already alluded to. Of course pairwise comparisons of these two proteins from differing organisms would yield a straight line going through the origin in a manner typical of Figures 6.2 and 6.3. Hence it is fairly safe to assume that, for viral proteins too, amino acid substitutions are accumulated smoothly over time. Indeed, this has been shown explicitly for a number of proteins from a varied group of viruses, including the influenza A, coronaviruses, HIV and herpes viruses (Hayashida et al., 1985; Gojobori et al., 1990; Querat et al., 1990; Villaverde et al., 1991; Elena et al., 1992; Sanchez et al., 1992; McGeoch et al., 1995; Yang et al., 1995; Leitner et al., 1997; Plikat et al., 1997) .",

The simplest hypothesis to explain the smoothness of protein sequence diversification is that the majority of fixed amino acid substitutions are neutral, being accumulated at rates intrinsic to each protein. This is not to say that positive selection is inoperative, merely that the majority of fixed substitutions are essentially neutral, so much so that it does not strongly distort the data from a linear relationship expected for genetic drift. In other words, neither the impact of different environments nor the ferocity of the adaptive immune response has much to do with fixation of most substitutions.

It is interesting that in a few areas of RNA virology much has been made of escape from the adaptive immune response, particularly cytotoxic T lymphocytes, so leading to persistence (Nowak and McMichael, 1995; McMichael and Phillips, 1997) . However, it is not at all obvious that this is the case (Wain-Hobson, 1996) . It must not be forgotten that it is possible to vaccinate against a number of RNA viruses such as measles, polio and yellow fever. Be that as it may, many DNA viruses, intracellular bacteria and parasites persist. In these cases de novo genetic variation arising from point mutations is too slow a means to thwart an adaptive immune response. For example, after 1700 generations, under experimental conditions whereby Muller's ratchet was operative, S. typhimurium accumulated mutations such that only 1% of the 444 lineages tested had suffered an obvious loss of fitness (Anderson and Hughes, 1996) . That this number of generations could be achieved within as little as 45 days gives an idea of the time necessary to generate a mutation affecting fitness. This is more than enough time to make a vigorous immune response. Some inklings of immune system escape for the herpes virus EBV (de Campos-Lima et al., 1993 came to nought (Burrows et al., 1996; Khanna et al., 1997) . When antigenic variation is in evidence among DNAbased microbes, it invariably results from the use of cassettes and multicopy genes rather than point mutations resulting from DNA replication. And of course such complex systems could have only come about by natural selection.",

For a virus to persist thanks to genetic variation the phenomenon of epitope escape must be strongly in evidence by the time of seroconversion, generally 5-6 weeks. Yet such data are not forthcoming, and not for want of trying. When viruses do play tricks with the immune system it is invariably by way of specific viral gene products that interfere with the mechanics of adaptive and innate immunity (Ploegh, 1998) . In the clear cases where genetic variation is exploited by RNA viruses, it is used to overcome barriers to transmission set up by the host population, e.g. herd immunity.

A Ka/K s ratio of less than 1 indicates that purifying selection is uppermost, while a ratio more than I is taken as evidence of an excess of positive selection. Comparisons for HIV proteins from different isolates have yielded the same result (Myers and Korber, 1994) . Some mileage was made out of the fact that this ratio increased with increasing distance of SIVs with respect to HIV-1, which in turn led to a discussion of SIV pathogenesis (Shpaer and Mullins, 1993) . However, this may reflect a lack of adequate correction for multiple hits. This effect is illustrated by a comparison of the set of 72 orthologous proteins encoded by herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2; Figure  6 .4A). The more divergent the protein sequence, the greater the Ka/K s ratio. That some proteins fix substitutions faster than others is no surprise. Yet as Figure 6 .4B shows, the K S values change little as they are near to saturation. When K is small, K S > K. This suggests that reliable interpretation of Ka/K s ratios is possible only when the degree of nucleic acid divergence is small. Now this is the realm of viral quasispecies rendered accessible by PCR. HIV studies abound, reflecting both the phenomenal degree Dolan et al., 1998) . A.

            "text": "Firstly, many studies have used small numbers of sequences and substitutions and even regions as small as nonameric HLA class-Irestricted epitopes. In such cases statistical analyses are essential to test the significance of the distribution of synonymous and non-syn-onymous substitutions. This is particularly important as the point substitution matrix is highly biased (Pelletier et al., 1995; Plikat et al., 1997) . It turns out that when the proportions are so analysed the distributions are rarely significantly different from the neutral hypothesis (Leigh Brown, 1997) . Secondly, the method for counting substitutions is highly variable, ranging from two-by-two comparisons, scoring the number of altered sites in a data set, to phylogenetic reconstruction. This latter method reflects more closely the process of genetic diversification. When so analysed, almost all of the data sets indicated proportions of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions indistinguishable from that suggested by genetic drift and/or purifying selection (Pelletier et al., 1995; Plikat et al., 1997) . Thirdly, prudence is called for. The fact that obviously defective sequences can be identified, occasionally accounting for large fractions of the sample (Martins et al., 1991; Gao et al., 1992) , indicates that not all genomes have undergone the rigours of selection (Nietfield et al., 1995) . Indeed, in peripheral blood, HIV is invariably lurking as a silent provirus within a resting memory T-cell. Such T-cells have half lives of 3 months or more (Michie et al., 1992) . Hence it would be erroneous to interpret findings based on a single or clustered samples (Price et al., 1997) . Only when the above caveats are borne in mind is there any hope of discerning how HIV accumulates mutations. When these issues are attended to, purifying selection is dominant (Pelletier et al., 1995; Leigh Brown, 1997; Plikat et al., 1997) .",

The authors noted that, when a comparable Ka/K s analysis was restricted to small segments, the number of protein groups scoring positive rose to 5% (Endo et al., 1996) .

The first describes the rate of genesis of mutations, the second attempts to describe their fixation within the population sampled over a period of time. In the case where all substitutions are neutral, the mutation rate (m) equals the fixation rate (f) per round of replication. It appears that such a situation applies to the evolution of parts of the SIV and HIV-1 genomes over 1-3 years (Pelletier et al., 1995; Plikat et al., 1997) . If fixation rates are measured over one year, then f = n.m, where n is the annual number of consecutive rounds of replication. It is simple to show that several hundred rounds of sequential replication are required (Wain-Hobson, 1993b; Pelletier et al., 1995) . Given that the proviral load of an HIV-l-positive patient (~107-10 9) changes by less than a factor of 10 over 5 years or more, and given the assumption that an infected cell produces sufficient virus to generate two productively infected cells, then annual production would be something akin to 2 200 , or 10 6~ which is impossible. Clearly even a productive burst size of 2 is too large (Wain-Hobson, 1993a,b) . This must be reduced to 1.1 to achieve a realistic proviral load (1.12~176 Note that the real value for the effective burst size must be even lower, as proviral load is turning over more slowly than once a day. Yet to explain the temporal increase in proviral load, the productive burst size must be 2 or more. Thus the calculation reveals massive destruction of infected cells, precisely what was to be expected from immensely powerful innate and adaptive immune responses. When purifying selection is in evidence, some additional factor must be introduced to couple the fixation and mutation rates. As the accumulation of most substitutions proceeds in a protein-specific linear manner for small degrees of divergence, the above equation can be modified to f -P-n. m, where 1 > P > 0 is a constant indicating the degree of negative selection. Note immediately that, as P < 1, more rounds of replication are needed to produce the same percentage amino acid fixation. A corollary is an even greater degree of destruction of infected cells. Consider the example of a virus that is fixing substitutions only slowly, about 10 -5 per site per year, something like the Ebola virus glycoprotein. The mutation rate for Ebola is not known but is probably around 10 -4 per site per cycle (Drake, 1993) . Hence P.n ~10 -1. What is the value of n? Most mammalian viruses replicate within 24 h, while obviously outside of a body they do not replicate. Consequently a value of n = 50-200 is probably not unreasonable. Accordingly P; 2 x 10 -3 to 5 x 10-4. This means that most mutations generated are deleterious. Of those that are fixed, most are neutral, as has been discussed above.",

However let's consider one example, the eukaryotic and retroviral aspartic proteases (Doolittle et al., 1989) . The former exist as a monomer with two homologous domains, while the retroviral counterpart functions as a homodimer. Despite these differences the folding patterns are almost identical, meaning that the enzymes may be considered orthologous. Between humans and chickens there is approximately 38% amino acid divergence among typical aspartic proteases ( Figure  6 .5). The HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases differ by a little more, 52%. No one would doubt the considerable differences in design, metabolism and lifestyle separating us and chickens. On either side of the HIV protease coding region one finds differences: HIV-1 is vpx-vpu \u00a7 while HIV-2 is the opposite, i.e. vpx+vpu-; there are differences in the size and activities of the tat gene product; the LTRs are subtly different. Yet both replicate in the same cells in vivo, produce the same disease, albeit with different kinetics: HIV-2 infection progresses more slowly. If these differences are esteemed too substantial, consider the 28% divergence between the HIV and chimpanzee SIV proteases. These two viruses are isogenic. Pig and human chromosomal aspartic proteases may differ by around 17%, the differences between these two species being, George Orwell apart, obvious to all. Even by this crude example, the AIDS viruses would seem to be more conservative than mammals in their evolution. The same argument pertains to the rhinoviral P2A and 3C serine proteases (Figure 6 .5).",

By contrast, mammals are fixing mutations approximately one million times less rapidly, i.e. approximately 10-8-10 -9 per base per year (Gojobori and Yokoyama, 1987) . However, the generation times of the two are vastly different, about I day for HIV and about 15-25 years for humans. Normalizing for this yields a 100-fold higher fixation rate per generation for HIV than for humans. Amalgamating this with the preceding paragraph, we see that HIV is not only evolving qualitatively in a conservative manner, but it is doing so despite a 100-fold greater propensity to accommodate change. The same arguments go for almost all RNA viruses and retroviruses. Why is this? Although they mutate rapidly, their hosts are effectively invariant in an evolutionary sense. Probably sticking to the niche is all that matters, which is no mean task given the strength of innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses.",

            "text": "John Maynard Smith's argument was simply put. For organisms with a base substitution rate of less than I per genome per cycle, he reasoned that all intermediates linking any two sequences must be viable, otherwise the lineage would go extinct. The example used was self explanatory: WORD --+ WORE--+ GORE -+ GONE ~ GENE (Maynard Smith, 1970) . The same is true for viruses, even though their mutation rates are 6 orders higher; the rate for a given protein is still less than 1 substitution per cycle. Even for rather stable viruses like Ebola/Marburg and human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/-2), the number of intermediates is huge. While the enormity of sequence space is basically impossible to comprehend, the amount accessible to a virus remains vast. For the lineage to exist, the probability of finding a viable mutant must be at least 1/population size within the host. Imagine a stem-loop structure. Any replacement of a G:C base pair must proceed by a single substitution, given that the probability of a double mutation is approximately 10 -4 that of a single mutation. Let substitution of a G:C pair pass by a G:U intermediate, finishing up as A:U. Although G:U mismatches are the most stable of all mismatches, they are less so than either a G:C or an A:U pair. There are two scenarios: either the G:U substitution is of so little consequence that it is fixed per se, in which case there would be no selection pressure to complete the process to A:U. Alternatively, the G:U substitution is sufficiently deleterious for selection of a secondary mutation to occur from a pool of variants, so completing the process. Yet the G:U intermediate cannot be so debilitating otherwise the process would have little chance of going to completion. Note also that if the fitness difference is small with respect to the G:C or A:U forms, more rounds of replication are necessary to achieve fixation of G:U to A:U. A corollary is that there must be a range within which fitness variation is tolerated. This is reminiscent of nearly neutral theories of evolution and their extension to RNA viruses (Chao, 1997; Ohta, 1997) . Note also that from a theoretical perspective the same secondary structure can be found in all parts of sequence space with easy connectivity (Schuster, 1995; Schuster et al., 1997) . Figure 6 .6 shows a number of variations on an HIV stem-loop structure, crucial for ribosomal frameshifting between the gag and pol open reading frames. There have been substitutions at positions 1, 2, 5, 8 and 11 and even an opening up of the loop. All come from viable strains, yet the environment in which these structures are operative, the human ribosome, is invariant. If the changes are all neutral the situation is formally comparable to the steady accumulation of amino acid substitutions. However, if the intermediates are less fit, it has to be understood how they can survive long enough in the face of a plethora of competitors, approximately 1/mutation rate or about 10 000 for HIV. The latter is probably the case as there are HIV-1 genomes with C:G to U:A substitutions at positions 5 and 8 ( Figure 6 .6). Extensions of nearly neutral theory would fit these findings well (Chao, 1997; Ohta, 1997) . That there are many solutions to this stem-loop problem is clear. If HIV-2 is brought into the picture, the remarkable plurality of solutions is further emphasized ( Figure  6 .6). Degeneracy in solutions found by viruses is revealed by some interesting experiments on viral revertants. The initial lesions substantially inactivated the virus. Yet with a bit of patience, sometimes more than 6 months, replicationcompetent variants that were not back mutations were identified (Klaver and Berkhout, 1994; Olsthoorn et al., 1994; Berkhout et al., 1997; Willey et al., 1988; Escarmis et al., 1999) . As the frequencies of mutation and back mutation are not equivalent, such findings are, perhaps, not surprising. What they show is the range of possible solutions adjacent to that created by the experimentalist. Loss of fitness can be achieved ",

Other examples include the lymphokine, interleukin 3, in which some forms with enhanced characteristics were noted (Olins et al., 1995; Klein et al., 1997) . With modern mutagenic methods allowing mutation rates of 0.1 per base per site or less, hypermutants of the E. coli R67 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) were found by random sequencing of as little as 30 clones (Martinez et al., 1996) . Whatever the mutation bias, mutants with 3-5 amino acid replacements within the 78-residue protein could be attained (Figure 6 .8). Other mutagenesis studies sought enzymes with enhanced catalytic constants or chemical stability. For subtilisin E variants with enhanced features for two parameters could be identified from a relatively small population of randomly mutagenized molecules (Kucher and Arnold, 1997) .

Almost all these viruses infect the same target cell using the membrane proteins CD4 and CCR5. Primary HIV-1 isolates use the chemokine receptor CCR5 and rarely the homologous molecule CXCR4, which differs by 81% in its extracellular domains. Yet two substitutions in the viral envelope protein gp120 are sufficient to allow use of the CXCR4 molecule (Hwang et al., 1991) . Curiously, the CCR5 chemokine receptor homologue, US28, encoded by human cytomegalovirus, can be used by HIV-1 despite the fact that US28 and CCR5 differ by 88% in the same extracellular regions . Clearly only a small set of residues are necessary for docking .",

Vpu is a small protein inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum, tucked well away from humoral immunity. Despite an average amino acid sequence difference of 0.5% among orthologous human and chimpanzee proteins, HIV/SIVcpz Vpu divergence is almost beyond reliable sequence alignment (Figure 6 .11): an N-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchor and a couple of perfectly conserved serine residues, which are phosphorylated, and that's about it. Among HIV-1 strains, or between SIVcpz sequences, the situation was a little better. Yet the necessity of keeping Vpu is beyond doubt. A fine final example concerns the HIV/SIV Rev proteins. These small nuclear proteins are crucial to viral replication. Despite this, only 5 residues are perfectly conserved. The situation has been taken beyond the limit, at least ex vivo, in that the HTLV-1 Rex protein can functionally complement for HIV-1 Rev (Rimsky et al., 1989) , despite the fact that they are completely different proteins.",

Yet replicons have been constrained by a series of historical events representing variations on a founding theme. While they are fit enough to survive, are they the best possible? This question is salutary, for we live in a society that is more and more competitive and, thanks to global communications, knows about the most successful athletes or businessmen worldwide. Yet who can remember the name of any Olympic athlete who came in fourth? Is not fourth best in any large population remarkable? How good are viruses as machines? Once again let us look at some examples from HIV-1. Reverse transcription feeds on cytoplasmic dNTPs. Yet supplementing the culture milieu with deoxycytidine -which is scavenged and phosphorylated to the triphosphate-substan-tially increased viral replication (Meyerhans et al., 1994) . It is known that good expression of a foreign protein is frequently compromised by inappropriate codon usage. By redesigning codon usage of the jellyfish (Aequorea victoria) green fluorescent protein gene to correspond to that typical of mammalian genes, greatly improved expression was achieved in mammalian cells (Haas et al., 1996) . The same group engineered codon usage of the HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein gene segment to correspond to that of the abundantly expressed human Thy-1 surface antigen. Again expression was greatly improved (Haas et al., 1996) . The coup de grace came with the reciprocal experiment-engineering Thy-1 gene codon usage to correspond to that of gp120. Thy-1 surface expression was greatly reduced (Haas et al., 1996) . Since HIV-1 was first sequenced, it has been known that its codon usage is highly biased (Wain-Hobson et al., 1985; Bronson and Anderson, 1994) . Something is clearly overriding maximal envelope expression. Furthermore, gp120 codon usage is similar for all other HIV-1 genes whether they be structural or regulatory. For that matter, codon usage is comparable for most lentiviruses Bronson and Anderson, 1994) .",

            "text": "For example, influenza A can persist in SCID children (Rocha et al., 1991) . How are innate and adaptive immune responses coupled and how are they influenced by genetic polymorphisms? 9 Third: with acquired immunity rising by day 3 in an acute infection, the virus is replicating in the face of a predator whose amplitude is increasing. 9 Fourth: immune responses are densitydependent. That is, the more the virus replicates the stronger the immune response. If the relationship were simply linear one could see how a virus might be able to keep just ahead, given a short lag in the immune response time. But if it were non-linear? Indeed it must be so, otherwise it would not be possible to resolve an acute infection. It is not easy to discern where optimal viral fitness would lie. 9 Fifth: The wrath of combined immune responses is such that there is massive viral turnover. For the three best known cases, HIV, HBV and HCV, between 108 and 1012 virions are turning over daily, representing between 10% and 90% of the whole (Ho et al., 1995; Wei et al., 1995; Nowak et al., 1996; Zeuzem et al., 1998) . Indeed, these are probably underestimates, given beautiful data from the late 1950s and 1960s showing that, for a variety of RNA viruses, plasma titres decay with a half-life of 15-20 min, whether the animal be immunologically naive or primed (Mimms, 1959; Nathanson and Harrington, 1967) . From this one may conclude that any viral population is unlikely to be in equilibrium. And if a population is not in equilibrium, fitness selection is compromised. 9 Sixth: A glance at any histology slide or textbook is a salient reminder of spatial discontinuities over distances of one or two cell diameters. For example the hugely delocalized immune system is characterized by a multitude of different lymphoid organs, a myriad of subtly different susceptible cell types, and a m616e of membrane molecules. The exquisite spatial heterogeneity of HIV within the epidermis and splenic white pulps has been described (Cheynier et al., 1994 (Cheynier et al., , 1998 Sala et al., 1994) . The same seems to be true for HCV-infected liver (Martell et al., 1992) . For HPV infiltration of skin, spatial discontinuities and gradients are also apparent. Discontinuities reduce the possibilities for competition and hence selection of the fitter forms. Indeed the M~iller's ratchet experiment and clonal heterogeneity are the most vivid expressions of this. 9 Seventh:muchhasbeenmadeofprivilegedsites and viral reservoirs. Basically this is reminding us of the fact that immune surveillance is modulated in some organs like the brain. There are some suggestions that cytotoxic T-cells have difficulty infiltrating the kidney. Viral reservoirs undermine fitness selection. 9 Eighth: in the case of the immunodeficiency viruses, antigenic stimulation of infected yet resting memory T-cells means that variants may become amplified for reasons that have nothing to do with the fitness of the variant (Cheynier et al., 1994 (Cheynier et al., , 1998 ).",

It allows a variant to break away from dominating competitors, disrupts or uncouples a fitter variant locked in competitive exclusion (de la Torre and Holland, 1990) . The effect of bottlenecking on fitness, as well as the M(iller's ratchet experiments, have been described (Chao, 1990; Duarte et al., 1992; Novella et al., 1995; Escarmis et al., 1996) .

Depending on the emergence time of primates of modern aspect, he was able to estimate the total number that existed as 5500-6500. The present number of 200 primates species would thus represent about 3.4-3.8%. More importantly from our viewpoint was his calculation of the average survival time of fossil primate species as a mere 1 million years (Martin, 1993) . Given that RNA viruses are fixing mutations approximately I million times faster than mammals (Holland et al., 1982; Gojobori and Yokoyama, 1985; , a viral species would become extinct after approximately 1 year! Immediately the annual influenza A strain comes to mind. Yet rabies, polio and HTLV-1 have arguably been around for millennia. Clearly the word \"species\", when taken from primatology, cannot apply to the viral world. Frogs provide a more interesting example. They have been around for several hundred millions of years, and members of some lineages can interbreed despite 75 million years separation. Naturally, their protein sequences have not stood still during that time (Wilson et al., 1977) . Enough is conserved to allow breeding. Maybe the primate picture has undue weight in our appreciation of virology. Phenotype can be maintained despite changes in genotypeobvious to a biologist.",

Among the smallest RNA and retroviruses are MS2 and hepatitis B virus, both about 3 kb, while the largest are the coronaviruses at 32 kb or more. Most of their proteins are structural or regulatory and take up the largest part of the coding capacity of the virus. Additional proteins broadening the range of interactions with the host cell, or rendering the replicon more autonomous, are relatively few. Large, gene-sized duplications that may contribute to diversification and novel phenotypes are rare, reducing the exploration of new horizons.
