After adjusting for age, HIV serostatus, and respiratory viral coinfection, the attributable fraction for PIV was 65.6% (95% CI [confidence interval], 47.1-77.7); PIV contributed to SARI among HIV-infected and -uninfected children <5 years of age and among individuals infected with PIV types 1 and 3. The observed overall incidence of PIV-associated SARI was 38 (95% CI, 36-39) cases per 100 000 population and was highest in children <1 year of age (925 [95% CI, 864-989] cases per 100 000 population).

There are 4 distinct types: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Parainfluenza virus infection is most common in childhood, and serologic surveys have shown that nearly all children have antibodies to PIV by 5 years of age [1, 2] . Parainfluenza virus is associated with 3%-10% of hospitalized respiratory tract infections in children and adults [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Parainfluenza virus infections occur throughout the year, but there are recognized patterns of seasonality associated with different types [11] . The clinical significance of identifying PIV infection among patients with respiratory illness does not necessarily imply causation because the virus may be found in individuals without respiratory symptoms [12] .",

For the estimation of association with SARI, we conducted an overall analysis adjusting for age, HIV serostatus, respiratory viral coinfection, and underlying illness and subanalyses stratifying by age and HIV serostatus and adjusting for respiratory viral coinfection and underlying illness. Then, we estimated the attributable fraction (AF) from the odds ratio (OR) obtained from the multivariable model using the following formula: AF = (OR-1)/OR \u00d7 100. In our second analysis, univariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with HIV infection among patients with PIV-associated SARI from January 2009 to December 2014 at all SARI sites.

For important variables in the HIV association and AF analyses that had substantial missing data, namely HIV infection status, we multiply imputed that variable as well as any variables that were incomplete and associated with HIV using chained equation multiple imputation over 10 iterations.

            "text": "Parainfluenza virus is associated with a significant amount of severe respiratory disease in South Africa among children <5 years of age, especially those that are infected with HIV. The evidence for this is based on 2 of our findings: the AF and the observed incidence. Among children <5 years of age, a substantial amount of SARI is attributable to PIV, particularly types 1 and 3. The observed incidence of PIV in Soweto, South Africa, is much higher among HIV-infected individuals and is similar to other respiratory viral pathogens such as influenza and human metapneumovirus [13, 17] . Clinicians should recognize PIV as a common cause of respiratory illness in children during the spring season, especially among children that are infected with HIV, and interventions should be developed to prevent and treat PIV disease.",

            "text": "It can be difficult to attribute respiratory disease to a specific pathogen. Molecular tests may identify viruses in respiratory specimens that may not be causing illness, and coinfection with other potentially pathogenic respiratory viral infections was common in our population. We found that a majority of SARI was attributable to PIV types 1 and 3 in children, even when controlling for viral respiratory coinfection, but not all studies have found that PIV is pathogenic. In fact, very few studies have adequately evaluated PIV in the context of controls. Two studies from Kenya that compared patients with respiratory illness to controls did not find a statistically significant attributable risk for PIV [6, 12] . However, a study comparing children <5 years of age from Thailand hospitalized with pneumonia to controls found findings similar to ours, specifically that infection with PIV types 1 or 3 was associated with disease [25] . The lower incidence and nonsignificant AF from our data among individuals \u22655 years of age suggests that PIV infection may not be associated with respiratory disease in older children and adults. We did not find a significant AF for patients infected with PIV type 2, but we may not have been powered to detect this because type 2 was the least common type. We found differences among patients infected with different types of PIV and between patients infected and uninfected with HIV. In children, patients with PIV-associated SARI who were HIV-infected were more likely to be older and to be coinfected with pneumococcus; however, the AF among adults was not statistically significant. The association between respiratory viral and pneumococcal infection, although not described previously for PIV infection, is well described for other pathogens such as influenza [26] and RSV [27] . Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was introduced in the South Africa childhood immunization system in 2009, so it was available and being used during the entire time of this study.",

            "text": "The seasonality of PIV in South Africa is similar to that seen in other temperate countries such as the United States, where PIV circulates during the northern hemisphere spring and winter seasons [28] . In contrast, in tropical and subtropical countries in Africa, such as Cameroon, Ghana, and Kenya, PIV does not appear to have distinct seasonality [6, 7, 29] . This is one of few studies that describe the epidemiology of PIV in both children and adults over a long period and in the context of controls. However, there were some limitations to our study. Not all children were tested for HIV, and we did not analyze PIV in cases of milder outpatient influenza-like illness, which includes common presentations of PIV illness such as croup. Although it is uncommon and uncommonly tested for, we did not test for PIV type 4, so our incidence estimates would be a minimum estimate. We also did not test for all viral respiratory pathogens, such as coronavirus and bocavirus. The large number of patients from CHBAH (70%) may bias results toward the epidemiology at that one site. Our calculation of incidence was for only 1 site and the calculation of AF was conducted at 2, so these analyses may not be representative of all regions in South Africa. The incidence may be an underestimate if patients did not seek medical care for their illness or sought care at a hospital other than CHBAH or died before reaching the hospital. The increased incidence of hospitalization among individuals infected with HIV may be due to a lower threshold for hospitalization compared with HIV-uninfected individuals. Lastly, we did not have data on steroid use, which is a common treatment for croup in children, and for patients with HIV infection, we did not have information on ART nor CD4 cell count.",
