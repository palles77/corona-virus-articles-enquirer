Replication-defective vectors may have a natural hostrestriction such as the avipox vectors [21] , or they may have been attenuated either by serial passage (e.g. yellow fever virus) so that they are less virulent with decreased replication competency in humans, e.g., Modified Vaccinia Ankara [22] or by genetic engineering that limits their replication to less than a single cycle (abortive replication), e.g., in the case of most adenovirus vectors [23] . The heterologous antigen gene may be of viral, bacterial, parasitic, oncologic, or gene therapy-based. The heterologous gene may comprise sequences coding for a portion of an antigen or an entire antigen, more than one antigen or heterologous antigen genes from more than one infectious agent [24, 25] .

The V3SWG hopes that by improving our ability to anticipate safety issues and meaningfully assess and interpret safety data from clinical trials of new viral vectored-vaccines, this will enhance safety knowledge as well as public confidence and vaccine uptake once licensed. One way to enhance our understanding of vectored-vaccine safety is to improve surveillance for Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI). Vaccine Associated Adverse Events (VAERS), sponsored by CDC and the FDA, has been in use since the 1990s (see below). Robust vaccine safety monitoring has many advantages including the discovery of potentially novel and unanticipated adverse events associated with vectored vaccines, the development and use of safer vaccines and minimization of the risk of Adverse Events (AE) after vaccination by providing specific recommendations, including contraindications and precautions for use [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .",

            "text": "As some live recombinant vectored-vaccines may integrate, one key challenge is defining the length of time for monitoring potentially related AEFI after receipt of viral vectored-vaccines. This time period must be chosen with care and based on considerations of clinical trials data and biological plausibility [36] . The follow-up time must be long enough to include (a) the plausible period of increased risk (also called ''risk window\" or ''risk interval\"), and (b) the comparison control ''non-risk\" time period for study designs where this period occurs post-(vs. pre-) risk window. In some studies of vaccine-associated Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), the risk interval included days 1-42 after vaccination during which vaccine-associated GBS was considered to be biologically plausible and the control interval was days 43-84 after vaccination. The number of events of each type was tabulated each week and the number of AE in the postvaccination window was compared with the number in the prevaccination window. This case-only self-controlled method (also referred to as self-controlled case series or SCCS) is commonly used in influenza vaccine safety studies to eliminate betweenperson biases [37] . SCCS is a preferred study design to avoid the ''healthy vaccinee\" effect (HVE) commonly associated with prerisk control windows. HVE refers to the fact that if an individual has been ill, recently hospitalized, or otherwise unwell, vaccination may be deferred by the health care provider, patient or primary caregiver until the health of the individual improves. This consideration is especially true for vaccinations in early infancy. Therefore, a vaccinated individual is more likely to be in a healthy state immediately before and after their vaccination. Consequently, HVE reduces AE rates in the immediate pre-and postvaccination periods, reducing the power to detect AE [38] . Selecting a surveillance duration that is too short or too long could cause a true increase in risk to be missed or obscured by random noise. Ideally, this duration should be based on statistical power considerations (e.g., continued until 90% power is achieved to detect the minimum absolute excess risk that is important for public health) and continued until any important risk can be ruled out. Due to the differences in background rates of specific AESI, the length of planned surveillance may differ by outcome for the same vaccine under study [39] . AESI may take time to manifest and be detected (e.g., the VSV Ebola vaccine that was found in synovial fluid causing arthritis) [11] .",

The group used febrile seizure and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis as models to provide an in-depth review of methodological issues related to the selection of risk and control intervals for consideration in future studies of immunization safety.

Rare but serious adverse events associated with vaccines or drugs are often nearly impossible to detect on account of the selected enrollment and limited follow-up of subjects in prelicensure studies and their detection requires conducting postmarketing monitoring (also called pharmacovigilance) after the introduction in the general population. The FDA also requires more diversity in the population studied because the incidence of AEFI might vary in different populations [48] . Safety of these products can only be inferred by the relative absence of AESI when the population exposed to the new pharmaceutical product of interest is sufficiently large, diverse and monitored adequately.

The US FDA and EMA have mandatory requirements for passive reporting of AEFI to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) [47] and EudraVigilance systems [50] , respectively. The World Health Organization (WHO) is helping many LMICs improve their capacity to monitor AEFI [51] , and these efforts could help to upgrade the capacity to monitor AEFIs over longer follow up periods (including coding AEFI for ICD (International Classification of Diseases), MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) etc. beyond the short follow-up periods currently used.",

For example, the CDC created the Vaccine Safety Datalink [53] (VSD) project in 1990 in collaboration with several managed care organizations. The VSD uses a distributed data model and de-identified International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coded data downloaded from the individual's electronic health record to track the use of health services by the members of each participating site. This includes information on vaccinations (e.g., vaccine type, date of vaccination, and other vaccinations given on the same day) and the specific medical illnesses that have been diagnosed at doctors' offices, urgent care visits, emergency department visits, and hospital stays. AEFI need to be coded accurately to be able to be found in the database. The US FDA oversees a complementary active safety surveillance system for vaccines called the Post-Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) program [54] . This consists mostly of insurance claims. The program is attempting to move to healthcare records and this brings with it new challenges.",

TreeScan is free data mining software that implements the tree-based scan statistic, a data mining method that simultaneously looks for excess risk in any of a large number of individual cells in a database as well as in groups of closely related cells, adjusting for the multiple testing inherent in the large number of overlapping groups evaluated. It has been developed for disease surveillance. For pharmacovigilance, it can be used to simultaneously evaluate thousands of potential adverse events and groups of adverse events, to determine if any one of them occur with higher probability among people exposed to a particular vaccine. For a particular disease outcome (e.g. kidney failure), it can be used to simultaneously evaluate if it occurs with increased risk among people exposed any of hundreds of pharmaceutical drugs or vaccines, or groups of related drugs or vaccines (https:// www.treescan.org/). The TreeScan method allows a wide range of unsuspected but potentially adverse reactions to be simultaneously evaluated and otherwise unknown adverse reactions may be found. The main disadvantage is that it is not possible to adjust for all possible confounders. Indeed, no conclusion about causality should be based on TreeScan analyses alone. In effect, the TreeScan method serves as a tool for identifying AE that may merit a further careful pharmaco-epidemiologic investigation [55] . Treescan is only beginning to be used more widely, so more time is needed to assess its effectiveness (e.g., AESI with insidious onset have traditionally been challenging to study in traditional large-linked databases using methods requiring a prior definition of risk intervals). The use of Treescan will also likely to be limited to settings with high-quality administrative health (including immunization) records initially. For LMICs, this requirement may be more likely to be met in some urban centers and INDEPTH Network sites.",

Case-control studies are particularly suitable for the study of relatively rare diseases with a long induction period, such as cancer and possible AESI. Since cases in a case-control are by definition subjects who have already developed the condition of interest, there is no need to wait for time to elapse. A similar approach can be taken for safety monitoring of viral vector vaccine candidates with the establishment of a registry of cases identified with clinically valid pre-specified AESI and matched controls found from the hospital or neighborhood to compare for vaccine exposure history. These studies can be multinational under a similar protocol. Given the rarity of these AESI, this is likely feasible only with post-marketing surveillance after substantial vaccine use has occurred. For settings where highquality administrative health records are unlikely to be a reality in near future, this may be one possible alternative.",

            "text": "Live viral vectors that express heterologous antigens of the target pathogen in vivo are being investigated in the development of vaccines for numerous infectious diseases, making use of a variety of viral vectors. Live viral vectored vaccines may be based on replication-defective as well as replication-competent viruses. As some live recombinant vectored vaccine may replicate, one key challenge is defining the length of time for monitoring AEFI after administration of vectored vaccines in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. This time period must be chosen with care and based on considerations of clinical trial data and biological plausibility. A long duration of monitoring is often challenging in countries with poor health infrastructure, in countries with evolving AEFI monitoring systems with multiple priorities and even in countries with excellent infrastructure which are challenged with new diseases and new vaccines [36, 40] . Some of the available options for defining the length of follow-up to be used in studies of new viral vector vaccine candidates include adapting from current relevant regulatory guidelines; convening a panel of experts to review the evidence from a systematic literature search to narrow down a list of likely or known AEFI and optimal biologically plausible risk window(s); conducting ''near-real-time'' prospective monitoring for unknown clustering's of AEFI in validated large linked vaccine safety databases (e.g., Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), PRISM, etc.). This includes Rapid Cycle Analysis (RCA) for prespecified AESI and TreeScan for previously unsuspected outcomes. The risk interval established by one of the above-mentioned methods can be used along with establishing a registry of cases identified with clinically validated pre-specified AESI to include in casecontrol studies. The available infrastructure, human and financial resources, coded databases in countries and regulatory guidelines will determine which (one or a combination) of these methods would be practically feasible. These options might be broadly applicable to the duration of surveillance for other new pharmaceutical products. The risk intervals selected for clinical trials or epidemiologic studies may not be of the appropriate length to rule out associations in individual cases. Since our knowledge of the pathophysiology of many AEFI is incomplete; a longer risk interval may be required when evaluating an AEFI in an individual. Rare individuals may have genetic immune defects that result in increased susceptibility to vaccine viruses. Mortality rates in vaccine recipients with such defects may be high. However, because of their rarity, they are likely to be discovered only in postmarketing analyses [63] .",
