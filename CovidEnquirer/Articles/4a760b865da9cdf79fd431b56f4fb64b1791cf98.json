            "text": "This study seeks to understand the general distribution of virome abundance and diversity in tropical freshwater ecosystems in Singapore and the geospatial distribution of the virome under different landuse patterns. Correlations between diversity, environmental parameters and land use patterns were analyzed and significant correlations were highlighted. Overall, the majority (65.5%) of the annotated virome belonged to bacteriophages. The percentage of Caudovirales was higher in reservoirs whereas the percentages of Dicistroviridae, Microviridae and Circoviridae were higher in tributaries. Reservoirs showed a higher Shannon-index virome diversity compared to upstream tributaries. Land use (urbanized, agriculture and parkland areas) influenced the characteristics of the virome distribution pattern. Dicistroviridae and Microviridae were enriched in urbanized tributaries while Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae were enriched in parkland reservoirs. Several sequences closely related to the emerging zoonotic virus, cyclovirus, and the human-related virus (human picobirnavirus), were also detected. In addition, the relative abundance of PMMoV (pepper mild mottle virus) sequences was significantly correlated with RT-qPCR measurements (0.588 < r < 0.879, p < 0.05). This study shows that spatial factors (e.g., reservoirs/tributaries, land use) are the main drivers of the viral community structure in tropical freshwater ecosystems.",

Land use changes are the primary drivers of the viral community and a range of associated infectious waterborne disease outbreaks (Patz et al. 2004 (Patz et al. , 2008 . In the water cycle, agriculture brings excess nutrients and agricultural chemicals to surface waters, causing oxygen depletion and increasing algal blooms (Foley et al., 2005) . Urbanization degrades water quality through surface runoff, and human pathogenic viruses have been detected more frequently in watersheds with dominant urban and agricultural land cover (Corsi et al., 2014; Lenaker et al., 2017) . Furthermore, human expansion into wildlife habitats or construction of zoos and animal parks provide opportunities for humanwildlife interactions, thus, increasing the risk for the possible transmission of zoonotic viruses to human populations (Patz et al., 2008) . These different anthropogenic activities harbor diverse and distinct viral hosts, including bacteria, plants, wild animals and humans. It is hypothesized that the environment surrounding these reservoirs may favor distinct viral predators and further change the viral community characterization. However, up till now, studies of land use impacts on the virome community in freshwater ecosystems are still limited as they mainly rely on traditional methodology (culture-based method or qPCR/RT-qPCR), which focuses on limited human virus targets without considering the whole picture of the viral community in the water environment (Corsi et al., 2014; Lenaker et al., 2017) . To date, there is no systematic report focusing on the geospatial distribution and diversity of viromes in natural surface waters and how they may be impacted by human activities and the effect of different land use. In addition, emerging viral pathogens of zoonotic origin could also be discovered through viral metagenomics, for which information is very limited.",

Water is a scarce resource in this country and a total of 17 reservoirs are used to collect rainwater and surface waters for potable water supplies. Increasingly, selected reservoirs are being used as focal points for sporting events (kayaking and dragon boating) and recreational activities so that the public can enjoy and appreciate water resources. As such, good water quality is needed to protect recreational users of these water bodies. Previous studies have detected waterborne viral pathogens (e.g., norovirus GI/GII, adenovirus, rotavirus and astrovirus) in Singapore water bodies using qPCR/RT-qPCR (Aw and Gin, 2011; Aw et al., 2009; Rezaeinejad et al., 2014) . Thus, continued surveillance of these viral targets as well as a broader range of viral targets expanded to the virome community coupled with land use information, could provide important data and new dimensions for managing the safety of water resources.",

To better evaluate land use impacts on the viral community, the sampling sites were classified into three categories: urbanized areas, agriculture areas and parkland areas. Sites 1, 2 and 3 included approximately 65e90% residential and urban land use, and as such can be regarded as urbanized areas. Site 4 had less than 30% of residential and urban areas, with about 33e84% green and 11e67% agricultural areas. Site 4 was the only sampling location with a reasonable percentage of agriculture area; therefore, Site 4 was considered as agricultural. Site 5 and Site 7 had similar land use percentage with more than 95% of the land covered with green areas; thus, it was considered as parkland. Site 6 included 80% of residential and urban categories. However, unlike Sites 1e4, there was no drain directly connected to the reservoir at this site and hence, the chance for possible viral contamination was relatively small. Therefore, Site 6 was classified as parkland areas as well as Site 5 and Site 7. The land use category clustering of the seven different sites illustrated the reasonability of our land use category classification (Fig. S1 ).",

In contrast, virome composition in reservoirs was similar across several sampling points in Singapore and shows a more stable pattern than the tributaries (Fig. 2B) . On average, Caudovirales accounts for 59.8% among all the annotated viruses in all the tributaries (Sites 1, 2 and 4) with a proportion of 58.1% and 61.7% in Jan and Apr, respectively. For the reservoirs, Caudovirales comprises an average of 70.65% among all the annotated viruses with a proportion of 72.9% and 67.8% in Jan and Apr, respectively. Note that the percentage of Caudovirales was higher in all the reservoirs than in all the tributaries. In contrast, the percentage of Dicistroviridae was higher in tributaries (11.8%) than in reservoirs (1.1%) in Jan (Tables S8 and S9 ). The percentage of Microviridae and Circoviridae in tributaries was approximately 4.6% (reservoirs: 0.34%) and 3.2% (0.21%), respectively. The shift in composition was observed as the percentage of Caudovirales decreased while the percentage of Dicistroviridae, Microviridae and Circoviridae subsequently increased, as locations changed from reservoirs to tributaries. Viral communities in different reservoirs in terms of land use impact were compared and the majority of viral communities were largely conserved and stable at the family level with Myoviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae as the main family level, and small differences observed in Dicistroviridae and other families (Fig. 2B) .",

It was also noted that the viral species richness from tributaries was also lower than their corresponding reservoirs. The average Shannon diversity of reservoirs and tributaries was computed as 10.4 and 8.4 respectively and a one-way ANOVA test showed that the Shannon-diversity of tributaries was significantly smaller than those from reservoirs (P < 0.05). This indicated that tributaries were more likely to be dominated by selected species compared to the reservoirs (Fig. S2 ) and this may be related to the viral host's presence (e.g., bacteria, archaea, algae, insects, plants, animals).

However, several fecal indicators including PMMoV, FRNAGI (MS2) and FRNAGIII (QBeta), were detected in our samples. Interestingly, in our study, the 6 PMMoV-affiliated contigs had a higher nucleotide similarity (97.25%e99.82%) with the average query coverage of 98.5% (Table 3 ), suggesting that PMMoV is a highly conserved virus with a lower evolution rate in the surface water environment. This result is similar with a recent study, where PMMoV detected in 85% of surface water samples shared 99e100% nucleotide identity with PMMoV reference genome (Rosiles-Gonz alez et al., 2017).",

It is noteworthy that metagenomics of DNA viruses and RNA viruses have been often considered separately and that studies of DNA viruses are far more than RNA virome analysis. This disparity is largely a result of technical challenges presented by RNA metagenomics as RNA is fragile and needs to be reverse transcribed into DNA. Thus up till now, the majority of the virome metagenomics papers studied either DNA or RNA (but not both). Moreover, the amplification protocol reported in these earlier studies may have influenced the final outcome (L opez- Bueno et al., 2009; Rodriguez-Brito et al., 2010) . For DNA viruses, the GenomiPhi Kit (GE Healthcare) has been used for amplification through DNA polymerase phi29 but it was discovered that it has a bias towards single-stranded circular DNA viruses. For RNA virome analysis, random priming mediated sequence independent single primer amplification (RP-SISPA) was used in Lake Needwood, Maryland (Djikeng et al., 2009) . Wang et al. (2002) developed a protocol capable of amplifying DNA and RNA viruses simultaneously. This was subsequently tested in reclaimed water, plasma samples, wastewater and ballast water (Bibby and Peccia, 2013; Kim et al., 2015; Rosario et al., 2009; Wylie et al., 2012) . RNA viruses account for more than 70% of the viral pathogens due to their adaptive abilities (mutations, recombinations or reassortments) to infect novel hosts easily (Temmam et al., 2014) . In our study, 92.3% of viruses are DNA viruses whereas 7.6% are RNA viruses among annotated viral families. Among all the viral pathogens detected by metagenomics, 10 contigs affiliated to human picobirnaviruses are DNA viruses whereas 2 contigs affiliated to cyclovirus are RNA viruses. The simultaneous application of combining both DNA and RNA metagenomics enabled the identification of a much larger numbers of viral sequences, especially for human-related viruses. This was the approach taken in our study here.",

They may also be responsible for human health in spite of the fact that they do not infect humans. This is because some phages can convey new properties of coding for toxin production to the host bacteria, thus converting harmless bacteria into pathogens (Grabow, 2001) , for example, the shiga toxin-converting phages have been known to change the pathogenicity of E. coli O157:H7 (Muniesa and Jofre, 2000) . Tributaries were found to have a higher proportion of Microviridae and Dicistroviridae. The hosts of Microviridae belonged to Enterobacteriaceae and obligate parasitic bacteria (Roux et al., 2012) . Most of the Enterobacteriaceae taxa strains are pathogenic, for example, virulent strains of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia. Enterobacteriaceae occurred more in tributaries, which may contribute to the distribution and abundance of Microviridae in tributaries. The hosts of Dicistroviridae are soil-inhabiting invertebrates (e.g., aphids and ants, which are common in tropical Singapore). Thus, the fact that tributaries harbor the viral hosts, indicate that the viruses may be released from catchments and be washed into the tributary periodically.",

This could be expected as intensive agriculture has been reported to bring nutrients and agricultural chemicals to the water cycle (Foley et al., 2005) , which in turn, disturbs the microbial community indirectly (Tseng et al., 2013) . Agricultural intensification has been associated with pathogen emergence transmission between wildlife and domestic animal populations and human populations, which in turn, could increase the species of zoonotic viruses (Pulliam et al., 2012) . Jones et al. (2008) concluded that agricultural practices are one of the socioeconomic drivers in the spatial distribution of emerging infectious diseases. However, the non-significant correlation between diversity and other land use types does not necessarily suggest weak connections between the viral community and land use factor, since a-diversity indices (Shannon diversity and Observed species) are just one aspect of characterizing the viral community and does not necessarily represent a complete view. b-diversity analysis indicated that Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae were enriched in reservoirs of parkland areas while Dicistroviridae and Microviridae were enriched in tributaries of urban areas (Fig. 3A) . Siphoviridae, Podoviridae and Microviridae belong to bacteriophage, which may be associated with parkland and urban enriched bacteria (i.e., Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria) in our study (Fig. 3E) .",

These differences could be due to the geographical (latitudinal gradient) differences in microbial diversity, as low-latitude tropical ecosystems tend to lead to higher biological diversity (Chown and Convey, 2007; Fuhrman et al., 2008) . Kim et al. (2016) reported that viruses had higher richness near the equator and lower richness at higher latitude, similar to human pathogen species (Guernier et al., 2004) . However, these comparisons between the diversity in freshwater virome studies need further confirmation due to different indices used (chao1, Simpson index, Shannon index, and observed species) and diverse calculation methods applied (e.g., PHACCs, QIIME, Catchall). By using PHACCs based on the contig spectra generated by Circonspect, Tseng et al. (2013) derived a Shannon diversity (H) range from 5.1 to 7 and from 7.8k to 21.8k viral genotypes in one subtropical freshwater reservoir, which was lower than the ocean's virome Shannon diversity in British Columbia, the Gulf of Mexico and the Sargasso Sea (H of 10.8, 8.21 and 7.74, respectively) (Angly et al., 2009) . The difference in methods used in published papers makes it difficult to draw comparable conclusions. A standard pipeline in deriving the viral diversity in ecology is required in order to make comparisons of viral diversity across diverse aquatic ecosystems from different studies.",

Even though the viral communities at the family level were conserved across different reservoirs, the PCoA plots suggested a dynamic shift in differences between contig levels of the viral community in terms of land use. The geospatial distribution patterns in the surface water environment could have resulted from both direct and indirect factors. On the one hand, the different land use patterns could also introduce foreign viral contamination into water bodies directly through urban/agriculture runoff, precipitation, leaking sewers, etc., while the viral community itself can be indirectly changed and characterized by the relationship to their hosts in specific environments. The runoff from the surrounding areas can also bring specific bacteria, or other vectors and nutrients into the reservoirs and the tributaries (Tseng et al., 2013) . Even though previous studies have shown the correlation between land use and water-borne viral pathogens (Corsi et al., 2014; Lenaker et al., 2017) , ours is the first study correlating land use cover with the whole viral community, thus overcoming the limitations of investigating specific viruses and providing comprehensive information on the community structure with the relationship of land use cover.",

Vergara et al. (2016) quantified illness risks of norovirus in an urban catchment in Singapore by using quantitative microbial risk assessment.

The discovery of cyclovirus VN in freshwater tributaries in the densely populated area of Site 2 in our study indicates a possible transmission of the emerging human cyclovirus in the Singapore urban water cycle.

The exception of reservoir 6 (explained in Results 3.1) suggested that drainage points could also be significant drivers in shaping the viral communities as well as land use cover and population density. Higher population density could result in high occurrence of human-related viruses (Lenaker et al., 2017) . Here, the population density to some extent could reflect the hotspots of human-related viruses. Limitation of using population density to quantify human activities and human-related viral hosts in our study exists as the population density referred to is the resident population. However, the mobile population such as those associated with modern transportation, tourism, business travel and immigration could also contribute to dissemination of these highimpact pathogens (Arguin et al., 2009 ). In addition, public holidays could introduce variation in population numbers to commercial and recreational areas based on lifestyle choices. Thereafter, more detailed data will be needed in order to track and investigate the human-related virus transmission patterns through virus-host interaction.",

A potentially relatively low abundance of human-related viruses in our surface water system and insufficient sequencing coverage could have resulted in rare sequences not being assembled into contigs for further downstream analysis. In contrast with our freshwater ecosystem, a previous study of sewage sludge samples revealed a large number of human viral pathogens, unveiling 43 types of human viruses (Bibby and Peccia, 2013) . This result is expected as the sludge matrix harbors large amounts of human-related viruses and the concentrations of viral pathogens are much higher.",

            "text": "In our study, a good Spearman rank correlation (0.588 < r < 0.795, p < 0.05) for the indicator virus PMMoV was discovered as the qPCR/RT-qPCR concentrations of this target are relatively higher (PMMoV geomean: 958.45GC/L). This suggests that viral metagenomics, to some extent, is a conservative estimate of the true viral abundance, based on validation of RT-qPCR data with RPKM in relative abundance of contigs, especially for contigs with a higher qPCR concentration. Similar results were also obtained in a previous study where a significant correlation (p < 0.0001) between qPCR and RPKM across viral taxa in clinical samples was obtained (Graf et al., 2016) . Overall, viral metagenomics has its advantage in the simultaneous discovery of the entire set of targets in the community in spite of the intrinsic limitation of downstream bioinformatics (i.e., assembly efficiency and database bias). It can pave the way in finding emerging zoonotic viruses and alternative plausible fecal indicators in predicting viral pathogens in the future. After zooming into the specific and desired targets using high throughput sequencing, gene-specific PCR or qPCR (e.g., cyclovirus-VN) could be further investigated to confirm the presence of these potential viral pathogens and zoonotic viruses to reveal the epidemiology or transmission patterns of these viral pathogens (Kim et al., 2015) .",

Correlations between the diversity index, physical-chemical parameters and land use patterns showed that environmental parameters (i.e., pH and precipitation) and spatial factors (e.g., reservoirs/tributaries, land use) are the main drivers of the viral community structure. Although enteric viruses were not detected by viral metagenomics, human-related viruses, including emerging zoonotic viruses, were detected in our samples indicating the importance of continued monitoring of these environments where specific hosts could be harbored. In addition, the links between qPCR/RT-qPCR and metagenomics were shown using both contigs and reads, confirming that our metagenomics quantification path is reliable and scientific. Even though metagenomics sequencing technology cannot replace qPCR/RT-qPCR due to its relatively low sensitivity in detecting gene-specific viral pathogens, its wide coverage of viral targets could add valuable information, such as detecting new, emerging zoonotic viruses and finding alternative fecal indicators or markers of contamination.",
