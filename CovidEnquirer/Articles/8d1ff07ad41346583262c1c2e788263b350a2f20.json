In this study, we modeled the 3D structure of S2 subunit and compared this model with the core structure of gp41 from HIV-1. We found that SARS-CoV S2 and gp41 share the same two a helices, suggesting that the two viruses could follow an analogous membrane fusion mechanism. Further ligand-binding analysis showed that two inhibitors GGL and D-peptide from HIV-1 gp41 may serve as inhibitors for SARS-CoV entry. q",

The S proteins of majority of coronaviruses are cleaved into two functional subunits, S1 and S2. Liu et al. [1] indicated that the S protein of SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) also forms S1 and S2 domains. The peripheral S1 portion is responsible for cellular receptor recognition, while the membrane-spanning S2 portion mediates the fusion of viral and cellular membrane, hence S protein determines the specificity of host and virulence of coronavirus [2] . Similarly, there are two non-valently associated subunits in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein, gp120 and gp41, gp120 directs target-cell recognition and viral tropism through interaction with the cell-surface receptor CD4, while the membrane-spanning gp41 promotes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes so that viral contents are released into the host cell [3] .",

In view of the fact that cutoffs for 'correct model' are ProQ-LG . 1.5 or ProQ-MX . 0.1, so the 'correct' model for S2 is the model built on template 1ezf_A, although other templates obtained marginally higher 3D scores. The alignment between S2 and template 1ezf_A with ClustalW [10] and secondary structure of S2 predicted by PsiPred v2.3 [11] are displayed in Table 1 . Fig. 1 shows that the 3D model of S2 subunit is Table 1 Alignment between SARS-CoV S2 protein and template 1EZF_A and secondary structure of S2 primarily consisted of a helices. In fact, Liu et al. [1] predicted the secondary structure of S protein by eight techniques and found that there are nine successive alphahelices in S2. Based on the presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids alternately, they speculated that these helices could be the amphipathic alpha-helices, which collapse into coiled-coils, bring a fusion peptide back toward the transmembrane domain and lead to the fusion of cellular and viral membranes [2] . The LGA method is designed to compare protein structures or fragments of protein structures in sequence dependent and sequence independent modes. We superimposed the protein structure of S2 into the core structure of gp41 (1aik) by LGA. Surprisingly we found that the N chain and C chain of gp41 are well overlapped with two helices in the 3D model of S2 subunit (Fig. 2) . For SARS-CoV S2 subunit, the corresponding residues include P879-N942, for HIV-1 gp41, the corresponding residues cover S546-G572 (N chain) and W628-L661 (C chain), each of residue pairs has a distance , 5 \u00c5 (Table 2) .",
