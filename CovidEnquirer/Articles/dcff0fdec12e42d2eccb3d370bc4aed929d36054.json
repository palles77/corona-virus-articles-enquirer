Residents have been comparing the situation to \"the end of the world,\" hospitals are \"overwhelmed\" and there are concerns about food shortages. \"Panic in Wuhan\" is a common refrain (Rubin and Wessely, 2020) .

Williams (2020) points out that in two correspondences published in Lancet Psychiatry, experts drew attention to patient populations that may need tailored interventions: older adults and international migrant workers Liem et al., 2020) . Hence, considering the large aging Chinese population and their susceptibility to COVID-19, older adults with psychiatric conditions may be experiencing further distress (Williams, 2020) . Moreover, they may not have access to care as a result of mass quarantine restrictions and public transport closure . Liu et al. (2020) highlighted that the COVID-19 epidemic has underscored potential gaps in mental health services during emergencies, while also testing the resilience of healthcare workers and medical systems. Duan and Zhu (2020) noted an increase of psychological problems during this epidemic, including anxiety, depression, and stress.",

Barbisch et al. (2015) describe how the confinement \"caused a sense of collective hysteria, leading the staff to desperate measures.\" Fear seems more certainly a consequence of mass quarantine. Anxiety within Wuhan is to be expected even without being in quarantine. During disease outbreaks, community anxiety can rise following the first death, increased media reporting, and an escalating number of new cases. Thus, mass quarantine is likely to raise anxiety substantially, for multiple reasons. Elevated anxiety may also have knock-on implications for other health measures (Rubin and Wessely, 2020) .",
