According to the latest nomenclature, which refl ects recent advances in taxonomy, the genus consists of only two species: Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori. Th e former is divided into six subspecies, which are distinguishable by certain biochemical characteristics and some of which correspond to previous subgenera. Th ese subspecies are listed in Table  8 .1. For the 17 serovars of S. bongori, the V was retained to avoid confusion with the serovar name of S. enterica subsp. enterica. Th us the full name would be S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. Since this is cumbersome, it is proposed to follow the suggestion of Old (1992) and use italic for the genus name Salmonella and roman for the serovar, e.g. Salmonella Typhimurium. In veterinary literature a distinction is usually made between infections caused by the two host-adapted serovars of S. Pullorum (pullorum disease), S. Gallinarum (fowl typhoid), the Arizonae subspecies of Salmonella (arizonosis) and the remainder of the salmonella infections (salmonellosis, paratyphoid infection).",

Mortality may ensue depending on the degree of virulence and host genetic background. Spread of certain strains, especially certain phage types of S.

Th e industry must therefore be constantly vigilant to maintain the highest standards of management and disease security at breeding farms, hatcheries, rearing farms, feed mills and processing plants in order to prevent the introduction and spread of salmonellosis, both from established serovars but also from new or emerging strains.

A proportion of infected birds become adult carriers with S. Pullorum infection persisting in the spleen until the birds become sexually mature, when the capacity to respond to infection is inhibited as a result of the presence of high concentrations of female sex hormones, resulting in the infection spreading to the reproductive tract, including the ovaries and ova. Such infected hens are not likely to be prolifi c egg layers and only a small percentage of the eggs laid are likely to be infected. Th e fertility and hatchability of infected eggs are also likely to be below average. However, viable chicks can hatch from such infected eggs and become a source of infection. Fluff from such chicks is likely to be heavily contaminated with S. Pullorum and, as it dries, the bacteria are rapidly disseminated through the incubator or brooder. Th us pullorum disease is passed from hen to chick by vertical transmission and then there is rapid lateral spread from chick to chick in hatcheries and rearing units. Th e organism can survive outside the body for many months. Th e immunological basis for the carrier state is unclear but it is known that the bacteria persist within macrophages in the spleen and that secreted proteins associated with Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 are essential.",

Th e needle is held by the operator and the brachial vein is pricked where it passes over the elbow joint. Th e needle is then reversed and a 0.02 mL drop of blood is picked up in the loop.

Between birds the needle is washed in saline, and after 12 tests have been completed the plate is washed in saline and wiped dry.

Vaccination reduces mortality in fl ocks challenged with S. Gallinarum and does not depress egg production when used in fl ocks free of the disease. Th ere is evidence, however, that immunity varies with the age and genetic susceptibility of the bird. Vaccinated birds can carry and excrete the rough strain of S.

Some vaccinated birds develop hepatic and splenic lesions without mortality but the vaccine has the advantage that few birds produce antibodies detectable by the WBT.

However, in 1982, members of the International Subcommittee on Taxonomy of Enterobacteriaceae decided that members of the Arizona group of bacteria should be classed in two subspecies of the genus Salmonella because their DNA was closely related to other Salmonella species. More than 300 antigenically distinct Arizona serovars have now been identifi ed and have been incorporated into the Kauff mann-White scheme as S. enterica subspecies IIIa (arizonae) and IIIb (diarizonae). Although the organisms were frequently isolated from diseased snakes on farms where there was a high mortality in infected turkey poults, it was suggested that Arizona organisms were opportunists that had spread from reptiles to turkeys. However, it was later shown that the infection was endemic in many turkey fl ocks in North America and spread occurred mainly by vertical transmission via the hatching egg. Th e types of Arizona organisms causing disease in turkeys were also found to be distinct from those aff ecting reptiles and the disease proved to be of considerable economic importance to the turkey industry in North America and certain other parts of the world.",

Experience in the UK has shown that the eradication of Arizonae infection from breeding turkey fl ocks is possible. In 1968 clinical arizonosis in turkeys was diagnosed in the UK in fi ve widely separated fl ocks. All the aff ected birds originated from one breeding fl ock comprising birds that had been imported as day-olds from California. Th ese had been in quarantine for 6 months without showing clinical or post-mortem evidence of arizonosis.

Th is was backed up by a system of management practices that included keeping the breeding birds isolated in small pens and slaughtering all the birds in a pen if one serological or cultural examination was positive. Th is control programme was eff ective and Arizonae infection was eliminated from the turkey industry in the UK. Th is illustrates that Arizonae infection can be eliminated from breeding fl ocks by a thorough and painstaking programme of testing and good management discipline. It also emphasizes how important it is for a country free of the infection to be constantly vigilant to ensure that arizonosis is not introduced with imported birds or hatchery eggs. ",
