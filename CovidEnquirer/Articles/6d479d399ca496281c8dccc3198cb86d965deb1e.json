The applicability of TVEC for other arrhythmias is currently unknown. Data from 138 TVEC procedures at Ghent University were retrospectively analysed and included 4 cases with dysrhythmias other than AF: a 2 year old trotter and a 6 year old warmblood with persistent atrial flutter (flutter rate 225 and 183/min), a 7 year old warmblood with persistent atrial tachycardia (atrial rate of 166/min) and a 16 year old warmblood with persistent ventricular tachycardia (180/min). Previous anti-arrhythmic treatment (quinidine sulphate for atrial tachycardia; magnesium sulphate, lidocaine and amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia) had failed in these horses.",

In the horse with ventricular tachycardia, after pre-treatment with amiodarone, one biphasic R-wave synchronised shock (360J, 39 Ohm) between one cardioversion catheter in the right ventricle and one in the left ventricle terminated the arrhythmia.

Thoracic Interpretation of equine ECGs during high intensity exercise performed during competition can be challenged by motion artifact, limitations in lead placement, and lack of clear definitions for what constitutes acceptable beat to beat variability. Whether experienced equine clinicians can agree upon rhythm diagnoses from ECGs obtained during sanctioned racing has not been studied. The electrocardiographic recordings of 32 Norwegian-Swedish Coldblooded trotters obtained during sanctioned racing events were therefore analyzed by 3 independent, blinded observers, each with >10 years of experience reading equine ECGs. The number and timing of rhythm events were recorded. Events were classified according to agreed-upon arrhythmia definitions established prior to obtaining the ECG recordings. R to R analysis was computer assisted by setting the maximum percent deviation to 5%. Agreement was estimated using Kappa statistics for inter rater agreement.",

The mucosa of the small intestine is the most damageable tissue to ischemia caused by strangulation obstruction. Studies on mucosal epithelium demonstrated that the villus tip is most susceptible to ischemia. But an extensive disruption of the epithelium happened within three hours of experimental ischemia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and epithelial damage. 71 horses with small intestine strangulation obstruction were included. Blood samples were collected before and tissues samples were resected during surgery from the antimesenteric midst area of the ischemic small intestine. ADH was enzymatically analyzed using Cobas C 311. Tissue samples were processed for histopathological survey. The significant factors which increased the ADH activity (>40 U/L, min 41, max 138) were the length of the ischemic small intestine (median 4.25 m, 1st quartile 2.75, 3rd quartile 13.0) and the complete disrupted epithelium from the villus tip to the upper third of the crypt. The data suggest that ADH strongly correlated with the epithelial damage. ADH activity >40 U/L could be a valuable prognostic marker for resection of the involved small intestine to owners and surgeons before taking the colic horse to surgery. Certain individual animals appear predisposed to recurrent pasture-associated laminitis. Previously multiple variables have been investigated as laminitis risk factors but only after disease occurrence. The study aim was to investigate laminitis risk factors prior to disease occurrence. Ponies \u22657 years old with no previous laminitis were recruited. Body condition score, height, weight and crest height and thickness were measured and an overnight dexamethasone suppression test performed. Plasma/serum concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, triglyceride, insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, C-reactive protein, von Willebrand's factor (vWF), soluble (s) E-selectin and sP-selectin were assayed. Follow-up was obtained annually for 2 years to ascertain laminitis development. Data were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. In total 446 animals were recruited to the study; the median (interquartile range) age was 15 (10, 20) years; 50.4% were mares and 49.6% geldings; the most common breeds were welsh (36%), Shetland (17%) and cob (9%); 72.2% were overweight/obese (BCS 7-9/9), 27.3% ideal weight (BCS 4-6/9) and 0.5% underweight (BCS 1-3/ 9 Four horses from the same farm were examined on sequential days for acute onset of severe muscle fasciculations, tachycardia, sweating and periods of recumbency. All were kept in a paddock with minimal pasture coverage but extensive growth of Malva parviflora, which they were grazing. Feed supplementation was minimal. Horse 1 was euthanized on the farm due to rapid clinical deterioration. Horse 2 was referred for hospital care where it was determined to have severe myocardial disease and generalised myopathy; this horse was euthanized due to prolonged recumbency and severe cardiac arrhythmias 36 h after admission. Horse 3 died during transport to hospital, and horse 4 was euthanized at onset of clinical signs. Post mortem examinations performed on horses 2, 3 and 4 revealed acute, multifocal, monophasic myonecrosis of cardiac and skeletal muscle. Myocyte glycogen accumulation was absent (PAS stain; horse 2). Acyl carnitine profiles were performed on serum from horses 2 and 4 and equine controls. These revealed increased C14-C18 acyl carnitines in cases relative to controls. Malvalic, sterculic, and dihydrosterculic acids (present in Malva parviflora) were grossly increased in sera of cases relative to controls. The prominent cardiac component and different acyl carnitine profile suggests a different aetiology to atypical/ seasonal pasture myopathy. We hypothesise that these cyclopropene fatty acids found in Malva parviflora interfere with fatty acid beta-oxidation in horses in negative energy balance, causing the clinical signs and abnormal acyl carnitine profiles. These equine cases closely resemble the human genetic condition Very Long Chain Acyl CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency. Paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) is an anti-oxidant enzyme associated with high-density lipoproteins in blood. PON-1 is a negative acute-phase protein being its plasmatic activity reduced during inflammation due to consumption by oxidants. Considering the possible clinical usefulness of PON-1 as an early inflammatory marker this is a preliminary validation study in horses.",

            "text": "Serum PON-1 activity was measured in 69 clinically healthy animals (31 adult female, 18 geldings, 11 stallions, 9 foals) using an enzymatic method adapted from other species. In order to preliminarily assess the possible utility of PON-1 as a marker of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), blood from 6 sick foals, classified according to a validated SIRS scale, was analyzed. Intra-and inter-assay imprecision were assessed by repeated analysis of pooled samples and evaluation of coefficient of variations (CV). Accuracy was indirectly evaluated through linearity under dilution (LUD) and spiking recovery test (SRT). Results of the different groups of healthy horses were compared to each other with a Friedmann test with Bonferroni correction. The method is precise (inter-and inter-assay CVs <5%) and accurate (LUD and SRT fit the linear model). PON-1 activity was higher in foals and in adult females (mean AE SD: 63.7 AE 15.5 and 60.8 AE 10.1, respectively) than in geldings and adult males (52.5 AE 10.2 and 47.2 AE 7.7, respectively). In 3/6 SIRS foals PON-1 activity was lower than the lowest percentile of distribution of healthy foals. This study demonstrated that the method of measurement of PON-1 activity in horses is precise and accurate and PON-1 may be a marker of SIRS.

Equine coronavirus (ECoV) has recently been implicated in several outbreaks of lethargy, anorexia and fever among adult horses. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA) targeting antibodies to the spike (S) protein of ECoV. Acute and convalescent serum samples from 83 adult horses involved in 6 different outbreaks were used. An ELISA starter accessory kit, the purified ECoV S-protein and anti-horse IgG were used for this purpose. Optical density (OD) values from the field samples, as well as from our positive and negative control samples, were obtained using the ELISA. The ELISA was able to reliably and repeatedly classify negative and positive control serum samples. The average corrected threshold OD was determined to be 0.955 with a standard deviation of 0.227. The assay was found to be linear over an OD range of 0.557-3.487. Intra-assay coefficient of variation ranged from 0.8 to 6.4%, with an average of 3.1%. The inter-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 1.9 to 4.2%, with an average of 3.0%. The greatest seroconversion rate was observed in horses with clinical signs compatible with ECoV and ECoV qPCR detection in feces. Results showed that the ECoV ELISA is able to reliably detect antibodies to ECoV and could therefore be a valuable tool to diagnose and monitor ECoV outbreaks in the future. Equine Metabolic Syndrome (EMS) has many parallelisms with human Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). MetS increases the cardiovascular risk and this is incompletely investigated in horses. The aim of this study was to examine the cardiovascular system of horses with EMS. Hypotheses were that EMS causes hypertension, higher sympathetic tone, resting and exercising arrythmias and echocardiographic changes consistent with hypertensive cardiomyopathy.",

Aguilera-Tejero 1 . 1 Veterinary School, University of C ordoba, 2 CCMC-Jerez, Spain This report describes a series of cases in which equine motor neuron disease (EMND) was associated to intestinal inflammation. A herd of young (1-3 years-old) Andalusian horses (n = 15) developed muscle atrophy, muscle fasciculations, paresis, weakness and weight loss. The onset of clinical signs was related to a period of restricted intake of green forage. Apart from poor body condition, horses did not show any symptoms related to gastrointestinal disease. A preliminary diagnosis of EMND was made based on clinical signs and low serum levels of vitamin E (0.11 AE 0.04 mg/dL, normal range: 0.3-1.5 mg/dL). Four horses, which were severely affected and deemed irrecoverable, were euthanized and subjected to detailed postmortem exam, which confirmed EMND and also allowed to rule out equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy. EMND was diagnosed based on changes in muscle histopathology (neurogenic atrophy) and spinal cord lesions (neuronal chromatolysis in ventral horns). An unexpected finding in the postmortem exam was the presence of enteritis with severe eosinophilic infiltrate in small intestine.",

            "text": "To our knowledge this is the first report of association between intestinal disease and EMND in horses. It is also interesting that EMND was diagnosed in a population of horses younger than previously reported. Although a mechanistic link could not be established, it is hypothesized that intestinal inflammation may have led to decreased absorption of vitamin E thus favoring development of EMND. In conclusion, based on the knowledge gained from these cases it may be rewarding to include a thorough gastrointestinal evaluation in the diagnostic work-up of EMND horses. Shock, since negatively associated with survival, is important to identify for management of colic in horses. Shock index (SI), the ratio between systolic blood pressure and heart rate (HR), has been shown to be an indicator for severity of shock in several species. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a modification of the shock index, the ratio between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR measured during colic surgery, may serve as a prognostic indicator for outcome in horses. Surgical records of horses that underwent colic surgery between January 2011 and February 2103 with complete anaesthetic records, were evaluated retrospectively. The Equine Surgical Shock Index (ESSI) was calculated as HR/MAP. ESSI measured at the first MAP measurement (FESSI) and the maximal ratio calculated during surgery (MESSI), were compared between horses that died and those that survived until hospital discharge. ROC analysis was used to establish area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of both ESSI to predict outcome. Of 139 horses studied 78.3% survived to discharge. FESSI and MESSI were significantly higher in non-survivors compared to horses that lived until discharge (P = 0.01; P = 0.008, respectively). AUC for MESSI predicting a negative outcome was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.59-0.95). MESSI of above 0.67 had a specificity of 90%, and a positive likelihood (LR + ) of 5.8 times for non-survival, while MESSI of above 0.78 had 97% specificity (LR + of 15.3) for non-survival. In conclusion, MESSI may be a valuable prognostic tool for horses with colic. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of diet, dose and repeated administration of omeprazole on intra-gastric pH in the horse. The study was performed under a NSW government ethics permit. Six Thoroughbreds were instrumented with indwelling percutaneous gastrotomy tubes. Intra-gastric pH was measured at two points, 5 cm apart within the ventral stomach for 23 h daily for 5 days. Horses were allocated into dose and diet groups in a 4-way cross-over design; a high grain/low fibre (HG/ LF) diet consisting of 1% BW each of grain and hay per day divided into two equal meals was fed at 10 am and 6 pm, or ad libitum hay (HAY) was fed; and 1 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg, of a commercial buffered omeprazole formulation was administered PO once daily at 8 am. At a dose of 4 mg/kg the time pH was >4 was higher in the HG/LF diet than the HAY diet (point 1 -88% vs. 57%, P = 0.001; point 2 -69% vs. 22%, P < 0.001). The time pH was >4 on point 2 was higher on day 5 than day 1 for both doses (1 mg/kg -66% vs. 28%, P = 0.001; 4 mg/kg -75% vs. 49% P = 0.001) and higher for 4 mg/kg than 1 mg/kg for both diets (HAY -19.3% vs. 3.9%, P = 0.03; HG/LF -66% vs. 28%, P < 0.001). The results suggest that dose and diet affect the response to omeprazole and that a cumulative effect of repeated administration is present.",

Mair 2 . 1 Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Rehovot, Israel, 2 Bell Equine Veterinary Clinic, Kent, UK A valid, reliable and usable scale is needed for assessing severity of acute pain in colic cases. Our aim was to compare three scales; the six-point Equine Acute Abdominal Pain Scale (EAAPS), a four-point scale by Mair & Smith (M&S), and a six-point numerical rating scale (NRS). Forty short films of horses, including 35 colic cases and 5 control horses, were randomly presented to 46 international equine clinicians by website. Randomly allocated into three groups, participants used one of three scales. Five films, randomly selected, were shown twice for intraobserver reliability. Speed, ease of use and face validity of the scales were evaluated. Response rate was excellent; 89% of the EAAPS (16/18), 100% of the M&S (18/18) and NRS groups (10/10). The intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.87 for EAAPS indicates significantly better interobserver reliability compared to 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58-0.79] for M&S and 0.71 for NRS. A kappa of 0.95 for the intraobserver reliability of EAAPS compared to 0.77 (95%CI: 0.68-0.86) for the other scales. Convergent, extreme group and predictive validities were comparable for all three scales. Regarding the usability of the scales, there was no significant difference between the three scales with respect to the time taken to score the films (speed) or the ease of use of the scales. The face validity, however, was significantly better for the M&S scale compared to the EAAPS scale. The EAAPS showed superior reliability, the M&S scale, better face validity with comparable usability and other tests of validity. Trigeminal mediated headshaking is a syndrome that may have several causes and is a potential threat to the wellbeing of the horse. Because one of the possible etiologies is an allergic rhinitis, a randomized double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial on the effectiveness of cetirizine, an antihistamine, in 30 seasonal headshakers was performed. A lunge protocol of 9 min, consisting of rest, walk and trot, was recorded at the start, after a week of treatment with cetirizine and after a week of placebo. Weather conditions were also recorded and owners kept a diary.",

It does suggest however that even if cetirizine will not be beneficial in all (seasonal) headshaking horses, it may be in some, both diagnostic for proving an allergic etiology, as well as therapeutic which is also suggested by follow-up of these horses and other clinical cases. Reduction of the hyperinsulinaemic response to feeding is central to the management of equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). The aim of this study was to compare insulinaemic and glycaemic responses to three commonly fed forages. Twelve ponies (11 mares and 1 gelding) of mixed breeds, mean age 9 years old (range 4-15) and median body condition score 7.0/9 (range 4.2-7.8) were recruited and maintained under identical management conditions. Following acclimation, a randomised crossover study was conducted. Each week ponies were fed 0.25% body weight as dry matter (DM) either as hay, soaked hay or haylage, or a combined glucose-insulin tolerance test (CGIT) was conducted. The glycaemic and insulinaemic responses to feeding were monitored over 5 h. Area under the curve (AUC) for insulin (AUCi) was greater for haylage compared to hay (P = 0.019) and soaked hay (P = 0.002), and greater for hay compared to soaked hay (P = 0.002). AUC for glucose (AUCg) was lower for soaked hay compared to hay (P = 0.002) and haylage (P = 0.003). Four ponies were classified as EMS positive based on their CGIT result. Compared to EMS negative ponies, EMS positive ponies had greater AUCi after hay (P = 0.027), soaked hay (P = 0.017) and haylage (P = 0.042). In contrast, there was no detectable effect of EMS status on AUCg. On an equivalent DM basis, soaked hay produced the lowest and haylage the highest insulinaemic and glycaemic responses to feeding. The insulinaemic effects of all forages were greater in ponies with EMS. These data can be used to guide feeding of equids with EMS. The Acer (maple) genus of trees comprises over 120 species worldwide. Some of these contain the plant-toxin hypoglycin-A which has been proven to be a cause of the highly fatal condition called atypical myopathy (AM) in horses and ponies. In an earlier study of maple-tree samples (leaves and seeds) collected by owners of healthy and AM-affected horses it was shown that the seeds contain significantly more toxin than the leaves. There is a concern as to whether maple trees can be safely retained or planted around paddocks or pastures, and whether there is a difference in toxicity between different species.",

Health hazards of obesity are more closely related to the localization of the fat excess, rather than elevated body weight per se. In this study effects of a diet-induced increase in body weight on body fat accumulation and localization was determined in 13 Shetland pony mares (3-7 years old), randomly divided into a control and a test group. They were fed either a maintenance diet (100% NE) or high fat diet (200% NE) for 24 weeks. BCS were not significantly different at the start of the diet (4.9 AE 1.2 vs. 5.1 AE 1.2) between both groups. Twelve weeks after starting the diet, measurements of the BCS, body weight and ultrasonography of adipose tissue on five different locations (retroperitoneal, axillary, withers, ribeye and rump) started on a monthly basis. Linear mixed-effects model with Bonferroni as post hoc test was used for statistics. P values <0.05 were considered significant. Fat thickness in the test group was already significantly higher compared to the control group at week 12. During the measuring period, the test group showed a further significant increase in mean body weight (+20%, P < 0.05) and BCS (8.3 AE 0.3, +61%) while the control group remained the same. The test group kept increasing retroperitoneal fat accumulation significantly over time, while adipose tissue stored in axilla, withers, ribeye and rump region ceased to increase after three months of measurements. In conclusion diet induced fat accumulation initially occurred both subcutaneously and retroperitoneally, while after 20 weeks further fat accumulation occurred mainly intra-abdominally. The aim of this study was to determine the residual effects of a 24 week high-energy diet on the blood pressure of obese Shetland pony mares. Four ponies (test group) received a diet rich in fat and carbohydrates containing 200% of their maintenance energy requirements and four ponies (control group) received a diet containing 100% of their maintenance energy requirements. The high energy diet resulted in weight gain of at least 20% and significant hyperinsulinemia. After the end of the 24 week period (t = 0) both groups received only ad libitum hay for 15 weeks. Before (t = 0) and after (t = 1) the hay-only period an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and non-invasive blood pressures (oscillometric device on coccygeal artery; Cardell 9402) were determined. A general linear mixed model with Bonferroni correction as well as a t-test was used for statistical analysis and significance was set at P < 0.05. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly higher in the test group (Psyst 134 AE 4 mmHg; Pdiast 69 AE 3 mmHg) when compared to the control group at t = 0 (Psyst 121 AE 6 mmHg; Pdiast 61 AE 1 mmHg) (P = 0.000) and t = 1 (P = 0.000). Diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher at t = 1 compared to t = 0 in the control group (P = 0.011). The hyperinsulinemic response to the OGTT did not change between t = 0 and t = 1 in the test group, while the blood glucose area under the curve increased. It can be concluded that a short term decrease of fat and carbohydrate intake does not change the blood pressure in obese hyperinsulinemic Shetland ponies. Ad libitum feeding of hay compared to meal feeding increases blood pressure in lean Shetland ponies. Baseline ACTH blood levels can vary in horses with moderate to severe pain, which makes the diagnosis of PPID difficult in some horses with laminitis or other painful conditions. It was therefore the purpose of this study to investigate, if the TRH-stimulation test is influenced by pain in horses without PPID. Included in the study were 16 horses with an age of one to 15 years without clinical signs of PPID and moderate pain due to different reasons. There were 13 horses with orthopedic problems including five horses with laminitis and three horses with colic. All horses were judged according to a modified painscore developed by BUSSI ERES et al. (2008), GRAUBNER et al. (2011) and DALLA COSTA et al. (2014) and divided into three different groups according to their pain level. Baseline ACTH and cortisol levels were measured and a TRH-stimulation test performed as previously described. Those horses that reached a painfree or mildly painful level were used as their own controls. All horses except one had baseline ACTH and cortisol levels within the reference ranges. There were no significant differences between the paingroups and the control group or in between the three different pain groups regarding baseline ACTH/cortisol levels or ACTH/ cortisol levels after stimulation (Kruskal-Wallis-Test and Wilcoxon-Rank-Test). Therefore in this study pain does not seem to have an influence on the outcome of the TRH stimulation test. Despite differing management systems, observations regarding gestation length and peri-parturient behaviour of mares and foals have mostly been limited to the Northern Hemisphere with few studies conducted in the Southern Hemisphere. Data were collected from one Thoroughbred stud farm in New Zealand over six consecutive breeding seasons (969 foaling records). At the time of foaling the gestation length, presentation, position and posture of the foal, time taken for the foal to stand and nurse and fetal membrane retention time was recorded. Gestation length for mares in this study was 349 AE 10 days. Gestation length for filly foals (348.3 days) was significantly shorter than for colt foals (350.7 days) and gestation length increased with increasing age of the mare. Most mares (53.5%) foaled between 7.00 pm and 1.00am and the occurrence of daytime foaling was 22.2%. Of the 969 foalings, 97.4% produced a live foal. The dystocia rate was 7.3%. Risk factors for perinatal foal death included being a colt and the occurrence of dystocia. Fillies were significantly (P < 0.001) quicker to stand and nurse than colts. Ninety five percent of mares had expelled their fetal membranes within four hours of parturition. Whilst some of these findings are similar to the results of studies performed in Northern Hemisphere populations, gestation length appears to be longer in this population of mares and there is a relatively high number of daytime foalings. Based on these findings, it is proposed that retained fetal membranes should be defined as retention beyond 4 hours post-partum. To assess the prevalence of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) in elite endurance horses after competition, 20 endurance horses (9 geldings and 11 mares, age 7-13 years) that competed in the same endurance race in different categories (100 km FEI*, 70 9 70 km FEI** or 100 9 100 km FEI***), had a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed twice after the race (3-8 and 36-38 days after). Horses were not in training during the study period. In addition, 12 horses matched for age and trainer (11 geldings and 1 mare, age 7-11 years) had a BAL performed to be compared as environmental and management controls. Samples of BAL fluid were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Prussian blue stains and routine cytological evaluation was performed to establish differential % leukocytes and the presence and % of hemosiderophages. The criteria to diagnose EIPH was hemosiderophages >1% in BAL fluid.",

The use of electrolyte supplementation for endurance horses is subject to discussion and evidence for their use is conflicting. The aim of this study was to investigate electrolyte supplementation amongst endurance riders in Australia. An online questionnaire was made available to riders via the Australian Endurance Riders Association (AERA) website and social media over a period of two weeks. The survey included 41 questions related to the type, dose, method, frequency and timing of electrolyte supplementation level of competition and performance data including causes of elimination. Descriptive analysis was performed and potential associations explored using Mann Whitney tests (at P < 0.05). Endurance horses were mainly purebred Arabian horses (67.9%) aged between 5-14 years. 100% of responders (88) supplemented with electrolytes at different times: during training (67.9%), precompetition (60.7%), during competition (85.7%) and post-competition (78.6%). Supplements were mainly used to replace electrolytes losses (37.5%) and were primarily supplied in food (78.9%) or in paste form (45.8%) while only 5.7% used salt blocks. Median dose rates were higher during competition (47.5 g) compared with training (30 g). Elimination rate was 14.3%, mainly due to lameness (75%), myopathy (7.1%) and high heart rate (3%). This pilot study suggests wide variation in electrolyte supplementation during endurance riding in Australia. However, larger numbers are required to investigate their use in more detail. Percutaneous liver biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing equine hepatopathy and Durham et al developed a liver biopsy scoring system, which proved useful in predicting survival in horses with liver disease 1 . Thirty liver biopsies were collected from horses suspected to be suffering from liver disease between January 2008 and May 2013 and owners were contacted by telephone to determine survival. A score was assigned to each biopsy using the system developed by Durham et al which was modified by including cholestasis and reversible cytopathology as these parameters were associated with a poorer prognosis in our study. Horses were categorized according to their biopsy scores and differences in survival between groups were assessed (using a chi-squared test), as were differences in enzyme concentrations (AP, AST, GGT and LDH) between survivors and non-survivors and between groups (using a two-sample t-test). A P-value <0.05 was considered to be significant. In the present study 17/30 (56%) cases survived for at least 6 months. There was no significant difference in survival or blood enzyme concentrations between different biopsy score categories or in blood enzyme concentrations between survivors and non-survivors. Using the modified liver biopsy grading system horses had a poorer prognosis if they had a biopsy score >1. Both scoring systems were easy to apply and scoring a larger number of biopsies would help determine the usefulness of these grading systems in the horse population under investigation in the present study and the added value of including cholestasis and reversible cytopathology. Omeprazole is a drug widely used to prevent and cure gastric lesions in the horse. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic behaviour of a new formulation of omeprazole in gastro-resistant granules after its daily administration at the dose of 4 mg/kg/die in 6 horses. Blood samples, taken at prefixed timepoints (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-treatment) during the 1st and the 29th day of treatment, were used to determine the concentration-time curves of omeprazole. Analyses were performed by LC-MS/MS and pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by WinNonLin 6.3 software according to a non-compartmental model.",

Directly post foaling umbilical blood was collected and approximately 12 hours post-partum a serum sample from the foal was taken. All samples were analyzed for NPHV RNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Antibodies against the nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) of NPHV were detected by luciferase immunoprecipitation system. Ante-partum four mares carried viral RNA. In one of these mares viral RNA was detected in the navel blood and in the serum of her foal. In the other three RNA-positive mares no vertical transmission was observed. Moreover, 80% of the mares were tested positive for serum antibodies against NPHV with the respective foals also being seropositive in their post-suckling serum samples. In navel blood samples no antibodies were detected with the exception of one mare. This is the first report demonstrating vertical transmission of NPHV in horses. The nonprimate hepacivirus (NPHV) is phylogenetically the closest relative to a major human pathogen, hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV infection causes severe acute and chronic hepatitis with potential sequelae of hepatocellular cirrhosis and carcinoma. Horses get infected with NPHV naturally, but neither the clinical relevance of the disease nor the route of transmission are known. Therefore, this study aims to assess the clinical course and equine immune responses after experimental NPHV infection. Three horses were injected intravenously with NPHV positive plasma with a viral load of 7.8 9 10 6 RNA copies/ml. Animals were monitored for clinical signs of hepatitis; blood samples were drawn for haematological, blood biochemical and virological evaluation on a weekly basis and liver biopsies were taken to evaluate parenchymal changes. Within 14 days of infection, virus RNA was detected in all horses. During infection horses remained bright and alert without showing clinical signs of disease. Nevertheless, clinicopathological data and indicated liver pathology in one of the horses. To assess acute phase responses, serum amyloid A was measured, but did not change significantly.

Possibilities for the lack of improved nerve regeneration in our model include lack of primary closure of the fascia after nerve transection, method of nerve transection, and interspecies variability. Studies regarding methods of equine SLC collection and re-evaluation of a model for peripheral nerve injury in the horse are needed. An accurate, non-invasive, pre-mortem diagnostic test for equine grass sickness (EGS) is currently lacking. We hypothesised that, while examination of haematoxylin and eosin stained rectal biopsies is unreliable (Mair et al. 2011 Vet Rec 168 266) , examination of rectal biopsies which are immunolabelled for b-amyloid protein precursor (b-APP) could facilitate accurate ante-mortem diagnosis of EGS. b-APP is a marker of neuronal injury that has been shown by quantitative proteomic analysis to be upregulated in cranial cervical ganglia (CCG) from EGS horses. With an ultimate end objective of determining the diagnostic utility of b-APP immunolabelled rectal biopsies, we compared the distribution and density of b-APP immunolabelling in neuronal perikarya and axons in sections of CCG and ileum from EGS horses, control horses and horses with botulism. A standardised scoring scheme (grades 0-3) was used to assess labelling intensity.",

The equine sarcoid is the most common skin tumor in the horse with a high recurrence rate. Feline fibrosarcomas show some similarities to equine sarcoids. Injections into the tumor bed of feline fibrosarcomas with poxviruses expressing feline interleukin 2 (IL 2) reduced the recurrence rate after surgical resection, due to a stimulation of antitumor immunity. The published sequences of feline and equine IL 2 show a high homology. In this study we investigated the safety and efficacy of the application of poxviruses expressing feline interleukin 2 in healthy horses and horses with equine sarcoids. Four healthy horses injected subcutaneously with the recombinant poxviruses expressing feline IL 2. One horse developed temporary mild swelling at the side of injection. There were no significant differences in the clinical examination and hematologic profile (CBC and fibrinogen) before and after injection. Up to now, four horses with a total number of nine equine sarcoids (occult and nodular) were treated twice with a seven day interval with recombinant poxviruses expressing feline IL 2. One sarcoid vanished completely, five showed reduction in size and three remained unchanged. There were no significant changes in the hematologic profile (CBC and fibrinogen) before and after treatment. One of the horses developed mild fever the day after injection, which subsided the following day. Treatment of equine sarcoids with recombinant poxviruses expressing feline IL 2 seems to be a safe and promising therapy option. The study is ongoing to substantiate the preliminary results. A 5-year-old donkey was referred with a history of one day pyrexia, lethargy and respiratory distress. First signs of a respiratory disease in the form of coughing were shown four months ago. The patient had tachypnea with increased respiratory effort and was in moderate body condition. Laboratory findings included leukocytosis, hyperfibrinogenemia and severe hypoxemia. Thoracic ultrasound examination showed disruption of the pleural surface and thoracic radiographs revealed signs of a mild interstitial pattern. The patient died peracutely before further diagnostic tests could be performed. Gross pathology showed multifocal, firm, well-demarcated, pale nodules throughout the lung. Overall the lung was voluminous with multifocal rib impressions. Histologically a severe, chronic-active, fibrous interstitial pneumonia with numerous syncytial cells, hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes and acute alveolar wall necrosis was evident. The clinical signs, necropsy findings and lack of other pathogens corresponded well with EMPF and therefore samples of frozen lung tissue were transmitted for further virus examination. The PCR testing for EHV-5 was negative. Subsequently a pan-herpesvirus nested PCR with specificity for the DNA polymerase gene was conducted. Sequencing of the obtained second-round PCR product revealed 100% identity when compared with Asinine herpesvirus type 5 sequences by the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. To the authors 0 knowledge, this is the first report of an AHV-5 infection leading to EMPF-like symptoms in a donkey in Europe. Obesity has been associated with increased circulating concentrations of insulin, leptin and triglycerides however little is known about the relationship among morphometric measurements and these blood variables related to obesity. The objectives of the study were to determine the association of morphometrics and scoring systems with insulin, leptin and triglycerides in Andalusian horses. A cross-sectional study was performed with 127 Andalusian horses (49 barren mares and 78 stallions) with a mean age of 6.37 AE 3.70. Horses were categorized based on BCS as obese if BCS \u22657. Morphometric measurements (in cm) including girth, waist, body length, and height at the withers were taken to calculate body ratios (girth:height, girth:length, waist:height and waist: length). Concentrated feed was withheld for at least 12 h before sampling. Blood extractions were performed between 06:00 and 12:00am to measure fasting insulin, leptin and triglycerides concentrations. Correlations between variables and mean comparisons were carried out. Thirty-three horses (26%) were obese. BCS, all morphometric ratios, leptin and triglyceride concentrations were significantly higher in obese horses. In the entire sample, BCS was significantly correlated with leptin, triglycerides, and all morphometric ratios, being girth:length the best correlated ratio Leptin was correlated with insulin and all body ratios. Triglycerides were correlated with waist:height and waist:length ratios. Insulin was correlated with girth: height and girth:length. These results show that in contrast with studies carried out in other breeds, BCS in Andalusian Horses, is not associated with insulin levels, and girth: length ratio is the best correlated parameter with it. Different diagnostic tests to determine the insulin sensitivity in horses are used in veterinary practice. Besides measurements of fasting insulin and glucose, dynamic tests like oral glucose tests (OGT) and combined intravenous insulin/glucose test (CGIT) are employed. We expected that OGT and CGIT may not be equally suitable to test insulin sensitivity in horses because of their different physiological mode of action. OGT and CGIT were performed in twelve healthy warmblood horses. Horses were of different sex, aged 15 AE 6.5 years and weighing 567 AE 81 kg. The body condition score (BCS) was 4.8 AE 1.6. OGT was performed with 1 g/kg bwt glucose administered via naso-gastric intubation. CGIT was performed with injection of 150 mg/kg bwt glucose solution and 0.1 IU/kg bwt insulin. Blood samples were taken for 3 hours in at least 15 minutes intervals and were analyzed for insulin, glucose, triglyceride and non-esterified-fatty-acid concentrations. The time course of glucose and insulin was similar in all 12 horses in the CGIT with initial peak in glucose and insulin at first sampling time-point followed by continuously and similar decrease during sampling period in all 12 horses. In contrast, in the OGT four horses clearly responded with an exaggerated insulin responsearea under the curve insulin (AUCins) 89.47 AE 18.61 ng/mL/min was significantly different (P < 0.0001) to the remaining 8 horses (AUCins 32.05 AE 10.44 ng/mL/min). There was no relationship of age, sex, weight or BCS to OGT insulin concentrations. The present results underline that OGT and CGIT mirror different facets of the metabolic response to a glycemic stimulus. In autmn 2014, 112 warmblood weanlings housed together developed clinical signs suggestive of acute strangles. All were sampled on one occasion by an amies-charcoal nasal swab for culture and qPCR to S. equi ssp. equi (S. equi) and S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus). Clinical signs were recorded, including fever (>38.2\u00b0C), nasal discharge, swollen regional lymph nodes or presence of ruptured abscesses.Additionally blood samples were analysed for WBC count. Based on clinical signs under follow up assessment until 17 weeks after the first occasion it appeared that the time of sampling coincided with the peak of outbreak.",

The described treatment protocols include the application of antitoxin, penicillin, tranquilizers (e.g. acetylpromazine), muscle relaxants (e.g. succinylcholine) among other intensive care measures.

Two trotter stallion siblings at the age of two years were referred to the Equine Clinic of the Free University of Berlin because of erythema, alopecia and crusting. After a diagnosis of immune mediated skin disease horses underwent long-term treatment with glucocorticoids and azathioprine. Two month later both horses developed hundreds of small wart-like proliferations at the head, neck and trunk. Biopsies from both horses were taken for histopathology and revealed well demarcated cup-shaped epidermal proliferations. Foci were covered by parakeratotic or abnormally formed keratin. In deeper layers numerous enlarged cells with cytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion-like structures and occasional intranuclear basophilic inclusion bodies were striking besides cells with a peripheral cytoplasmic clearing (koilocytes). Histopathological findings were consistent with endophytic papilloma similar to the Le Net-type described in immunosuppressed dogs (Le Net et al., 1997) caused by a distinct canine papillomavirus. Furthermore Papillomavirus DNA was detected in tissue samples using a broad range PCR analysis. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis of a partial sequence from the L1 gene placed the virus in the genus Lambdapapillomavirus. This kind of papilloma is exceptionally rare and has not been described in horses in the literature so far. A retrospective review was performed to assess for trends between 2007 and 2014 in the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates obtained within three days of first admission of equines to the University College Dublin Veterinary Hospital. Repeat isolates and bacteria contemporaneously identified as probable environmental contaminants were excluded. Isolates from nasal screening programmes were included. The Chi squared test for trend was used to assess changes in the total proportion of 'sensitive' results over the study period. 486 isolates met inclusion criteria. The Chi-squared test for trend demonstrated a significant change in susceptibility for all isolate/ antimicrobial combinations (P < 0.001) over the study period; subsequently graphically identified as increasing susceptibility. The proportion of isolates sensitive to tested antimicrobials (95% confidence interval) for each respective year were 0.73(AE0.03), 0.74 (AE0.03), 0.76(AE0.03), 0.77(AE0.04), 0.82(AE0.04), 0.83(AE0.04), 0.74 (AE0.05) and 0.78(AE0.03). A Chi-squared test for trend limited to antimicrobials used systemically in adult equines (ceftiofur, cefquinome, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, marbofloxacin, penicillin, polymixin B, tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) was not significant (P > 0.1). Respiratory tract isolates (including sinus and nasal samples) (n = 118) and wound isolates (n = 110) respectively demonstrated the following proportions of isolates to be sensitive: ceftiofur (0.77;0.96), enrofloxacin (0.86;0.91), gentamicin (0.55;0.57), marbofloxacin (0.92;0.95), penicillin (0.49;0.61), tetracycline (0.60;0.65), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (0.7;0.65). The increase in antimicrobial susceptibility identified may be attributable to a reduction in antimicrobial resistance; alterations in the antimicrobial panel tested; or reduced antimicrobial exposure prior to presentation. These findings will assist Irish veterinary practitioners in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, while awaiting microbiology results, for respiratory disease and wound cases. The aim of the current study was to compare the prevalence of AAD in three referral hospitals (two in south-eastern UK; one in the eastern USA). Medical records from the 3 hospitals were reviewed. Horses admitted with diarrhoea, or which were transferred to the Isolation unit due to diarrhoea during hospitalisation were included. AAD was defined as the development of diarrhoea in horses treated with antimicrobials for a non-gastrointestinal complaint in the 2 weeks prior to admission. Horses from Hospital 1 were admitted between 1999 and 2012; Hospital 2 between 2010 and 2012 and Hospital 3 between 2006 and 2007. Clinicopathologic data, antimicrobials implicated and outcome was recorded, and prevalence of AAD was compared between institutions, and between countries. AAD was diagnosed in 21/126 horses with diarrhoea (16.7%). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of AAD between centres: Hospital 1 9.4% (n = 6/64), Hospital 2 16.7% (n = 6/36) and Hospital 3 34.6% (n = 9/26). (P = 0.01) There was a significant difference in the prevalence of AAD between countries: UK 12% (12/100); USA 34.6% (9/26). (P = 0.01) A wide range of antimicrobials and antimicrobial combinations were implicated. No significant difference in clinicopathologic data and outcome was identified between AAD and non-AAD horses, apart from rectal temperature, which was higher in horses with AAD (38.6\u00b0C versus 38\u00b0C; P = 0.04). These results suggest that a geographical difference in the prevalence of AAD may exist. Further investigation into risk factors, in particular the type of antimicrobials commonly implicated, should be pursued in different geographical locations to further explore this result. This was an intervention study performed on 45 pastured horses and ponies, at a sanctuary in Eastern England to describe the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of the faecal metabolome of healthy pastured animals and to characterise responses to dietary supplementation with enzyme-rich malt extract (ERME). Faecal samples were collected non-invasively before and six weeks after supplementation with ERME (24) or a control feed (21) twice daily. The faecal metabolome was characterised using selected ion flow tube -mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) in conjunction with multivariate analysis in order to distinguish between controls and those fed ERME. Principal components analysis was also employed to observe any trends and groupings within the respective data sets. While all animals in both groups originally had a similar faecal metabolome, those in the supplemented group developed marked changes, showing that twice-daily use of this supplement was sufficient to alter the faecal metabolome in animals on pasture. The volatile faecal metabolome was dominated by organic acids, alcohols and ketones; this study demonstrates that twicedaily dietary supplementation with ERME may significantly alter the profile of VOCs in pastured horses and ponies which could be important in optimising therapeutic strategies and preventative interventions for diseases associated with grazing on pasture. Equine gastric mucosal ulcer syndrome (EGUS) is a well-known disease in equine medicine. Several studies reported a protective effect of feeding alfalfa hay in adult horses and foals. In the present study the effects of feeding alfalfa chaff to weanlings were investigated by using weaning as a stress model of induced gastric mucosa lesions. 89 warmblood weanlings (mean BW AE SD: 252 AE 23 kg, age 5-6 months) were included into two feeding trials. The first trial consisted of three groups and the second trial of two groups. Gastroscopy was performed prior to weaning and 15-16 days after weaning. Immediately after weaning, weanlings were allocated to the different groups. First trial: alfalfa chaff I (n = 21), total mixed ration (TMR) (n = 16) and hay I (n = 16); second trial: molassed alfalfa chaff (n = 18) and hay II (n = 18). The alfalfa chaff/molassed alfalfa was fed two times a day, the TMR ad libitum and hay was fed three times daily.",

Evaluation of the physiological mechanisms involved and of the efficiency of the designed product on horses subject to clinical recurrent exercise rhabdomyolysis requires further investigation. Laminitis is a complex disease, characterized by phases of vasodilatation and vasoconstriction that in clinical cases are difficult to recognize with conventional techniques (digital pulse, x-Rays or venography). The purpose of this study was to evaluate vascular dynamics, by Doppler ultrasonography, submitting peripheral vasculature to vasodilatation through exercise and, to distal vasoconstriction through criotheraphy in healthy horses. Cross sectional study including 12 healthy adults horses of different breeds was designed. Two groups were made, group 1 included 7 horses that were submitted to exercise for 30 minutes, and group 2 included 5 horses that were submitted to criotherapy applying an ice bag to the distal aspect of the limb for 60 minutes, measurements were made every 15 minutes during 1 hour for both procedures. Qualitative spectrum characteristics and quantitative Doppler measurements of the left and right lateral palmar digital arteries were obtained in each group. Interestingly, an increase in arterial diameter was recorded and low resistance pattern turn to more laminar pattern in both groups. However while decreased peripheral resistance was observed after exercise, peripheral resistance and the pulsatility index were increased after cryotherapy. Moreover, 3 horses showed reverse diastolic blood flow after cryotherapy. These results shows that peripheral vascular dynamic changes are evident in healthy horses with induced vasodilatation and distal vasoconstriction and can be identify by Doppler ultrasonography. In laminitis, the just in time identification of the ongoing process can help to focus the treatment established and adapt it, depending on vascular dynamics observed.",

Veterinary Teaching Hospital University of Extremadura, Avda de la Universidad s/n, 10071, C aceres, Spain Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne disease caused by the intraerytrocytic protozoan parasites Babesia caballi and Theileria equi. Infected animals may remain as carriers of these blood parasites for long periods of time and act as sources of infection for other ticks. The introduction of carriers into areas where competent tick vectors are prevalent can lead to an epizootic spread of the disease. Equine Piroplasmosis is considered endemic in some areas of Europe, such as Spain. Endurance racing is a demanding discipline consisting on achieving long distances in a timely fashion and horses with the subclinical disease or carriers could potentially have performance limitations. The objective of this study is to determine the seroprevalence of equine Piroplasmosis in endurance horses and the effect on its performance. Forty horses from different competitions were included. Several clinical and laboratory parameters for each horse were analyzed. The presence of antibodies was confirmed with indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) for Babesia and Theilleria. The seroprevalence of equine piroplasmosis, tested by indirect inmmunofluorescence antibody was 70%. Thin blood smears were negative for hemoparasites. The parameters with greater variations between the two periods, pre and post exercise, were the concentrations of CK, AST and LDH. The mean PCV before the competition was lower for the group with piroplasmosis. There were not significant differences between Piroplasmosis positive and negative horses in the performance. The presence of subclinical piroplasmosis does not influence athletic performance in endurance horses.",

Measurements performed in real time, 30 min, before 30 min (M0), soon after (M1), 30 minutes (M2), one hour (M3), two hours (M4) six hours (M5) and 24 hours (M6) after training. Results: M0 spine region temperature was a higher in SG than RG. Significant M4 e M5 temperature increase in RG and SG. Average croup temperature (M0) was higher in SG than RG, both sides. In RG, except M6, all other times shoed increase in left temperature. Right side M0 was lower than all times. In SG, the temperature increase occurred in M1, M4, M5, both sides and M2 on the right side. No temperature changes between groups in the thoracic tendon regions, with higher temperature in M0 (SG) and M6 (RG) in the left and right hind limbs. Significant temperature increase for all times, comparing M0 (RG), right and left thoracic and pelvic limbs, and right pelvic (SG). No temperature increase (RG), only in M6. Spinal regions, croup and left hind limb temperatures were higher (SG) before start of training, contrary to right pelvic limb tendons. The type of training did not influence the temperature of the tendons of the forelimbs, and both training cause temperature increase in the studied regions. ",
