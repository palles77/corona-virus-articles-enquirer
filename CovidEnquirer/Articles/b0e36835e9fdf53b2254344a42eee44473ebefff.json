            "text": "The objective of this study was to describe preweaned dairy heifer calf management practices on dairy operations across the United States that were used to analyze factors associated with colostrum quality and passive transfer, Cryptosporidium and Giardia, morbidity and mortality, and average daily gain. This study included 104 dairy operations in 13 states that participated in the National Animal Health Monitoring System's Dairy 2014 calf component study. This 18-mo longitudinal study focused on dairy heifer calves from birth to weaning, and data were collected on 2,545 heifer calves. Descriptive statistics were generated regarding colostrum feeding, preweaning housing, milk feeding and consumption, growth, morbidity and mortality, and weaning practices. The majority of calves enrolled were Holsteins (89.4%). Over half the calves (63.2%) enrolled in the study received the majority of their colostrum via bottle; however, 22.1% of calves from 51.0% of operations received colostrum via suckling from their dams. For all calves, the mean time to the first colostrum feeding was 2.8 h, and the average amount of colostrum at the first feeding was 2.9 L, with 4.5 L provided in the first 24 h. The mean serum IgG of all calves was 21.7 g/L; however, 76.0% of operations had at least 1 calf with failure of passive transfer of immunity with a serum IgG below 10 g/L. The majority of calves in the study were housed individually (86.6%). Nonetheless, 20.2% of operations housed some calves in groups, representing 13.4% of all calves. Approximately one-half of the calves in the study (52.3%) were dehorned or disbudded during the preweaning period, with only 27.8% of these calves receiving analgesics or anesthetics during the procedure. Whole or waste milk was the liquid diet type fed to 40.1% of calves, and milk replacer was fed to 34.8% of calves. A combination of milk and milk replacer was fed to 25.1% of calves. Calves, on average, were fed 2.6 L per feeding and fed 2.6 times/d, resulting in a total of 5.6 L of liquid diet fed per day. The mean average daily gain for all calves enrolled in the study was 0.7 kg/d. Fecal samples were collected and almost all operations had at least 1 calf positive for Cryptosporidium (94.2%) or Giardia (99.0%), and 84.6% of operations had calves that tested positive for both Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Over one-third of calves (38.1%) had at least one morbidity event during the preweaning period and the mortality rate was 5.0%. The mean age at weaning was 65.7 d. This study provides an update on dairy heifer raising practices in the United States.",

            "text": "The management of preweaned dairy heifer calves in the United States is complex and varies based on many factors, including operation size and location. Previous reports regarding management practices of preweaned dairy calves have been published (Heinrichs et al., 1994; Fulwider et al., 2008; Walker et al., 2012) . However, continual change in the industry necessitates current information regarding management practices of preweaned dairy heifer calves throughout the United States. Additionally, rearing heifer calves is an expensive endeavor at approximately $5.50/calf per day (Zwald et al., 2007) . Nevertheless, the cost of raising a heifer calf generally does not exceed the cost of purchasing a springing heifer (McGuirk, 2008) . Therefore, ensuring that preweaned heifer calves are managed properly to produce healthy dairy cows is extremely 9169 important to the industry. As part of USDA's National Animal Health Monitoring System Dairy 2014 study (USDA, 2016) , the calf component aimed to describe current dairy heifer calf health and management practices during the preweaning period. The objectives of the longitudinal heifer calf study were to (1) describe practices related to colostrum management, milk feeding, and calf housing; (2) evaluate colostrum quality and passive transfer; (3) estimate the incidence of disease and its relationships with management factors; and (4) evaluate ADG during the preweaning period. The specific objective of this paper was to describe the study sample of operations and calves that were used to analyze factors associated with colostrum quality and passive transfer, Cryptosporidium and Giardia, morbidity and mortality, and ADG.",

Calves that tested positive for BVDV were excluded from the study. Colostrum samples (40-50 mL) from the first feeding of colostrum administered to each calf were collected in conical screw-top tubes and frozen until shipping. Blood samples (5 mL) from calves between 1 and 7 d of age were collected in serum separator tubes, and samples were centrifuged if possible before shipping. Colostrum and blood samples were shipped together on ice to USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories (Ames, IA). Blood samples were centrifuged at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories and serum was separated. Serum and colostrum samples were then accumulated and shipped in bulk to the Saskatoon Colostrum Co. (Saskatoon, SK, Canada) for testing. Colostrum samples were tested for IgG concentration using radial immunodiffusion and Brix score using a digital Brix refractometer. Serum samples were tested for IgG concentration using radial immunodiffusion, total protein, and Brix score using a digital Brix refractometer. Blood samples collected within 24 h of birth or after 7 d of age were excluded from this analysis.",

Wells 1 to 4 and 39 to 42 were for 2 replicates of each of the 4 calibrators used to generate the standard curve, wells 5 to 9 and 10 to 14 were for each of the 2 reference standards that were used to qualify the plate, and wells 15 to 38 were used for test samples. Serial 2-fold dilutions (1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32) of the bovine IgG standard (Bovine Serum Calibrator cat. no. 4005, Midland BioProducts Corp., Boone, IA) , reference bovine serum (CVB bovine IgG species standard working stock is further diluted 1:4), and reference colostrum (diluted 1:15) were prepared in PBS. A 1:4 dilution of test serum and a 1:15 dilution of test colostrum were prepared using PBS. Two replicates of 4 \u03bcL of each dilution of the bovine IgG standard were dispensed for the standard curve. Two replicates of 4 \u03bcL of the diluted reference colostrum and reference serum and 4 \u03bcL of the diluted test sample were dispensed on the plate. The plates were incubated at 20 to 25\u00b0C for 18 to 19 h in a humidified chamber. As a measure of preservation to prevent microbial growth, sodium azide was added to the liquefied agarose solution to a final concentration of 0.01%. A plate reader was used to measure and record the ring diameters for the precipitin rings surrounding the wells (Digital RID reader, AD400, The Binding Site Inc., San Diego, CA). Using the results (ring diameters) obtained for each of the 2-fold dilutions of the bovine IgG standard and an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) with calculation formulas, a regression line was generated for each plate for the variables R (ring diameter) versus log 10 (concentration). The plate was considered acceptable if the coefficient of determination was greater than 0.97 for the standard curve, and the mean values for the reference colostrum and reference serum were the expected values \u00b110%. Immunoglobulin concentration for the test sample was determined using the regression line of the bovine IgG standard obtained for each plate.

Only 8.7% of operations and 6.7% of calves were provided heat-treated colostrum. This is slightly higher than the 1.5% of operations that reported heat-treating colostrum in the NAHMS Dairy 2014 study (USDA, 2016) . Heat-treated colostrum was generally heated to 60\u00b0C, except on 1 operation on which colostrum was heated to 63\u00b0C. The majority of calves in the study (63.2%) received colostrum via a bottle. Nevertheless, 22.1% of calves on 51.0% of operations received colostrum via suckling from their dams. Furthermore, only 17.3% of all operations, representing 11.8% of calves, reported an on-farm Brix reading of their colostrum before laboratory testing. However, in the NAHMS Dairy 2014 study, only 4.1% of operations reported completing an on-farm Brix reading (USDA, 2016) . In total, 278 calves had both on-farm and laboratory Brix readings. The mean for all on-farm colostrum Brix readings was 23.6%, which was the same as the mean laboratory colostrum Brix reading of 23.5%. Of all colostrum samples that were tested on-farm and considered high quality (>22%), 17.9% of samples were below the 22% cutoff when tested at the laboratory. The majority of calves (77.3%) received excellent quality colostrum (>50 g/L). Nevertheless, 90.3% of operations had at least 1 colostrum sample with an IgG concentra- Brix score. The mean time to first colostrum feeding and amount at first colostrum feeding for all calves was 2.8 h (SE 0.1), and 2.9 L (SE 0.0; Table 4 ). The mean total amount of colostrum provided to all calves in the first 24 h was 4.5 L (SE 0.0). The mean colostrum IgG concentration for all heifer calves was 74.2 g/L (SE 0.7) and the mean serum IgG concentration for all calves was 21.7 g/L (SE 0.2). The general recommendation is to remove the calf from its dam within 2 h following birth and feed at least 10% of BW (approximately 4 L for a 40-kg calf) of quality colostrum (IgG >50 g/L) at the first feeding, within 4 h following birth (BAMN, 2001; McGuirk and Collins, 2004; Godden, 2008) . Following these recommendations has been proven to reduce failure of passive transfer. Additionally, it is recommended that, on the farm level, 90% of all calves have excellent passive transfer to minimize overall morbidity and mortality (McGuirk and Collins, 2004) . Pooling of colostrum from multiple dams is generally thought to decrease overall colostrum quality and increase disease risk, as it might result in mixing larger volumes of low-quality colostrum with smaller volumes of higher quality colostrum and mixing of possible disease pathogens (Arthur et al., 1996) . Heat treatment of colostrum needs to be performed at a low temperature (60\u00b0C) for a longer period of time (60 min) compared with milk pasteurization to prevent protein (i.e., immunoglobulin) denaturation (Godden et al., 2006) . A Brix refractometer is a simple on-farm instrument to evaluate colostrum quality and passive transfer status; a Brix reading greater than 22% (Quigley et al., 2013) . Very few operations in this study used a Brix refractometer to measure colostrum quality. However, measuring colostrum quality before administration can help prevent failure of passive transfer.

The mean group size was 12.5 calves (SE 0.4) with a range from 3 to 25 calves per group. Similar results were reported in the NAHMS Dairy 2014 study, with 74.9% of operations housing calves individually and 19.6% housing calves in groups (USDA, 2016) . The majority of calves (80.3%) were housed with natural ventilation. Approximately one-half of the calves in the study (52.3%) were dehorned or disbudded during the preweaning period. Only 27.8% of the dehorned/disbudded calves received analgesics or anesthetics during the procedure. This is Historically, individual housing of calves has been promoted by the dairy industry because of studies that showed increased weight gain and lower disease incidence (Chua et al., 2002) . However, recent studies demonstrated potential benefits of group housing for calves, both socially and physically (Chua et al., 2002; De Paula Vieira et al., 2010) . Given that research supports both housing strategies, each farm must assess its management style, ability to detect disease in calves, and overall calf-rearing priorities to decide the best housing style for the operation. Disbudding or dehorning is routinely performed on preweaned dairy calves to reduce the risk of injury to other cattle and workers. Dehorning is a painful procedure regardless of the method used. However, an analgesic or anesthetic helps minimize the pain of the procedure (Graf and Senn, 1999; Grondahl-Nielsen et al., 1999; Mellor, 2005) . Ultimately, managing perioperative pain associated with disbudding or dehorning can minimize the negative effects attributed to pain, including decreased weight gain (Stafford and Mellor, 2011) . Nutritional requirements-including high-quality calf starter and fresh clean water-should be met from the first day of life throughout the preweaning period to support calf growth and rumen development (BAMN, 2003) .",

Protein is considered the rate-limiting nutrient for calf growth (Drackley, 2008) . Therefore, as long as the liquid diet is similar in quality to whole waste milk, all diet types should be sufficient for calf growth. Historically, calf-feeding programs included twice-daily feedings of approximately 2 L/feeding (Thickett et al., 1986) . This practice of restricting milk intake led to increased starter intake but at the cost of calf health and growth. More recently, enhanced feeding programs with higher percentage protein milk replacers or ad libitum feeding programs have gained popularity (Jasper and Weary, 2002; Terr\u00e9 et al., 2009 ).",

Approximately half of operations (49.5%) and 31.1% of calves were weaned based on starter intake. Preventatives, including vaccinations and antibiotics, were given to 18.2% of calves at the time of weaning. Antibiotics were the most common preventatives provided, with 12.8% of all calves receiving an antibiotic at the time of weaning. The mean age at weaning for all enrolled According to the Bovine Alliance on Management and Nutrition (BAMN, 2003) , calves should be consuming at least 0.7 to 0.9 kg of starter for 2 to 3 consecutive days before weaning. Judicious use of antimicrobials is recommended to optimize therapeutic efficacy and minimize antimicrobial resistance. ",

Both studies are in agreement on areas that have improved within the dairy industry, such as decreased mortality and decreased failure of passive transfer. Additionally, this study describes areas where producers can continue to advance heifer calf management and welfare, such as enhanced feeding programs to increase ADG, detection of clinical disease signs, and weaning programs to efficiently and effectively wean calves. As stated earlier, rearing heifer calves is an expensive endeavor, at approximately $5.50/calf per day. Therefore, research to maximize the efficiency of raising replacement heifers and minimize losses due to morbidity and mortality is extremely important. The descriptive statistics reported here can be used as a source for researchers to better understand current practices regarding dairy heifer calf management and ultimately help guide various research projects in the future. These results can also be used to guide education programs for dairy producers to improve overall heifer calf health. ",

Operations may have had calves in more than one variable level; therefore, the sum of a variable might not always equal 100%. tion of 50 g/L or less. Additionally, 16.5% of operations had greater than 90% of all colostrum samples with an IgG concentration >50 g/L. This illustrates that almost all operations fed suboptimal colostrum to at least 1 newborn calf and reinforces the importance of testing the quality of all colostrum samples on-farm. Approximately three-fourths of all tested calves (72.7%) had excellent passive transfer of immunity (serum IgG concentration >15 g/L). Conversely, 76.0% of operations (13.0% of all calves) had at least 1 calf considered to have failure of passive transfer of immunity with serum IgG below 10 g/L(Gay, 1983). Only 16.3% of operations had >90% of sampled calves with excellent passive transfer (>15 g/L). Serum total protein and serum Brix score, which are often used as on-farm measurements of passive transfer, showed similar results to serum IgG concentration. Serum total protein level and serum Brix scores were compared with serum IgG concentration to develop comparable categories (R 2 = 0.803 and R 2 = 0.797, respectively). Of all serum total protein samples tested, 15.6% of calves were considered to have failure of passive transfer of immunity (serum total protein concentration <5.1 g/L) and 75.4% had excellent passive transfer of immunity (\u22655.4 g/L) based on serum total protein concentration. About one-fifth (21.2%) of all farms had \u226590% of calves with excellent serum total protein. Serum Brix score classified 15.2% of all calves to have failure of passive transfer of immunity (<8.1% serum Brix score) and 71.3% to have excellent passive transfer of immunity (\u22658.6%).
