Knowledge of prior or recent infections of the head and neck is important. History of a known tick bite prompts suspicion for tick-borne illnesses in a child with a neck mass, with the specific illness depending on geographic region of residence. Bartonella henselae or toxoplasmosis play an important role in human pathogenicity, and should be considered if there has been exposure to a cat or cat feces. For those with a history of unpasteurized milk product ingestion or contaminated soil exposure, those from endemic regions, those with immunocompromised state, and/or a history of tuberculosis (TB) exposure, etiologic considerations would include atypical mycobacteria, TB, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respectively. A patient history of head or neck radiation should be considered. Family history is also key, because disorders with a clear hereditary pattern such as multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2, neurofibromatosis, head and neck cancers, autoimmune disorders, or vascular anomalies may be linked to the patient's presenting neck lesion.",

            "text": "A comprehensive knowledge of the borders and contents of the fascial spaces of the neck is essential in diagnosing and characterizing pediatric neck lesions. 1 The neck may be divided into central and lateral spaces. The lateral neck is further divided into the anterior triangle and the posterior triangle. Neck lesions are also described according to levels ranging from IA to VI (Fig. 1 ). 2 The central neck comprises dissection levels IA and VI. Its borders extend midline from the mentum to the sternal notch, with palpable structures including the hyoid bone, thyroid and cricoid cartilage, thyroid gland, and upper trachea. 1 The lateral neck is divided into anterior and posterior triangles, delineated by the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. The anterior triangle, including neck dissection levels IB to IV, ranges from anterior to the posterior border of the SCM to midline, superiorly along the inferior border of the mandible to the mastoid tip, and inferiorly to the clavicle. 1 The posterior triangle runs from the posterior border of the SCM to the trapezius muscle and inferiorly to the clavicle. 1 Lesions in the supraclavicular fossa have a much higher likelihood of malignancy. 1 In describing the quality of a neck mass, specific characteristics to include are the size, mobility, tenderness, and appearance of the overlying skin. Benign characteristics include mobility within the soft tissue plane (rather than fixed), well-circumscribed, and small in size. It is important to know if any illness or trauma preceded the mass. Does the lesion fluctuate in size and, if so, what prompts these changes? Drainage or pitting would suggest congenital fistula or deep abscess. If a midline mass elevates with swallowing or tongue protrusion, a thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC) would be likely. In pediatric patients, biopsy is more frequently pursued in larger lesions that persist several weeks, do not resolve with antibiotic therapy, are fixed, or are in the supraclavicular fossa.",

Examination of the oral cavity may reveal mucosal or dental lesions that may also contribute to formation of neck masses.

It is appropriate to culture any material expressed from an abscess or from any surface lesion, that is, a nasaopharyngeal culture for increasingly more common respiratory viruses such as metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, or tonsillar culture if group A streptococcus is suspected. A B henselae immunofluorescence assay blood test assesses for cat scratch disease if there is a history of such an incident or exposure. Toxoplasma gondii antibodies (immunoglobulins G and M) should be considered if applicable, as well as Lyme and ehrlichiosis titers, HIV testing, tuberculin skin testing, and a chest radiograph, if the TB test is positive. Acidfast bacilli testing is important in confirming atypical mycobacteria. If thyroid involvement is probable, a thyroid panel may be considered. Further workup largely depends on the location and characteristics of a lesion. If an abscess is present, fine needle aspiration with a Gram stain would be recommended, to facilitate directed antibiotic therapy, along with acid-fast bacilli staining for mycobacteria, if suspected. Flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy will often be deemed necessary for upper airway evaluation. If neoplasm is present, laboratory tests and excisional biopsy are confirmatory of diagnosis, and appropriate referrals will need to be made for multidisciplinary management.",

            "text": "Various imaging modalities, including ultrasound examination, computed tomography (CT) scans, MRI, and MR angiography are used for the evaluation of pediatric neck lesions, and each has its own advantages, limitations, and indications. 3 The radiologic Evaluation and Management of Pediatric Neck Masses evaluation of pediatric patients after physical examination often begins with conventional ultrasound examination and color Doppler ultrasound examination owing to its nonionizing and noninvasive ability to depict superficial structures. 3 Ultrasound examination can define the size and extent of localized superficial masses and determine a cystic or solid nature. Color Doppler ultrasound examination can demonstrate the vascularization of the mass, displaced normal surrounding vessels, or intralesional flow. 3 However, ultrasound examination findings may not allow definitive characterization, especially for deeper lesions. 3 CT scanning aids in the morphologic characterization and staging of neck masses, and allows for the precise visualization of fine bone structures, calcifications, and deep soft tissue compartments that cannot be demonstrated with ultrasound examination. 3 Particular attention should be paid to minimizing the radiation exposure of CT scans, particularly in pediatric patients. 3 MRI, with an absence of ionizing radiation and multiplanar capability, offers superior contrast resolution in evaluating masses in complex areas, including the head and neck. 3 CT scanning is a more rapid study than MRI, but either modality may require intravenous sedation for younger patients. 3 The gold standard for diagnosis of vascular lesions involves MRI with gadolinium and/or Doppler ultrasound examination to measure flow. 4 Arteriovenous malformation and arteriovenous fistula are high-flow lesions, whereas venous and lymphatic malformations are low-flow lesions. 5 Both hemangiomas and vascular anomalies enhance on T2-weighted images. 1 Lymphatic malformations appear as multilocular cystic lesions on ultrasound imaging, and also show hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI. 4 For embryologic tracts, MRI with fistulogram helps to determine the extent and final disposition of the tract. Each case warrants careful consideration regarding imaging so as to obtain the greatest yield with the least risk to the patient.",

Forty percent of dermoid and epidermoid cysts are diagnosed at birth, with the majority of the remaining 60% of these cysts presenting before the age of 5 years. 1 On noncontrast CT, a dermoid cyst usually appears as a low-density, unilocular, well-circumscribed mass. 4 Fat, mixed-density fluid, and calcification (<50%) may also be seen, and there may be coalescence of fat into small nodules within the cystic lesion, giving a \"sack of marbles\" appearance ( Fig. 6) . 4 The presence of calcifications and cystic spaces in these lesions aids in their differentiation from lipomas. 4 Patients respond well to surgical excision, which is typically curative.",

            "text": "Laryngocele A laryngocele is formed by a congenital herniation of the saccule of the larynx, and more commonly presents in adulthood rather than the pediatric population. 1 This herniation can be limited to the anatomic boundaries of the larynx (internal laryngocele), or extend through the thyrohyoid membrane (external or mixed laryngocele). 1 When a laryngocele extends beyond the larynx, it often presents as an anterior neck cyst that episodically fills with air. 1 The etiology is suspected to be from a congenital enlargement of the laryngeal saccule, followed by a period of prolonged increased laryngeal pressure (from straining or crying) with a partial obstruction of the neck of the saccule, trapping air within the herniated tissue 1 (Fig. 12 ). An internal laryngocele presents more commonly in infancy as stridor, respiratory distress, feeding problems, and/or chronic cough. In the pediatric population, external laryngocele most commonly presents during the teen years in conjunction with playing a musical instrument that requires increased laryngeal pressure, such as the trumpet. External laryngoceles may form a visible or palpable mass in the neck. 11 Evaluation, particularly with presenting symptoms of airway compromise, may require fiberoptic or direct laryngoscopy. A CT scan with contrast is the most accurate imaging modality for defining spatial relationships between a laryngocele and laryngeal structures, as well as extralaryngeal soft tissues, in differentiating a laryngocele from other cystic formations, and in identifying the coexistence of any laryngeal malignancy 11 (Fig. 13) . Management, based on severity of symptoms, may include respiratory support with the possible need for intubation and/or tracheostomy, observation, cyst decompression via needle aspiration, endoscopic resection, or resection through an external approach. 11",

There are 2 subtypes of congenital hemangiomas: rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma and never involuting congenital hemangioma. 1 Rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma are hemangiomas that are fully developed at birth and immediately begin to involute. Never involuting congenital hemangioma are also fully developed at birth, but maintain their shape and size, and never involute. 13 Involution of rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas takes place at an estimated rate of 10% per year, so that approximately 50% have involuted by 5 years of age, 70% by 7 years, and 90% by 9 years. 13 An association has been shown between cervicofacial hemangiomas in a beard distribution and subglottic and upper airway hemangiomas; patients with 2 or more hemangiomas along the jawline should be observed for stridor or a crouplike cough. Laryngoscopy is critical at the first sign of stridor or croup in these patients. 14 PHACES syndrome should be considered in patients with 2 or more of the following for which it is named: posterior fossa abnormalities, hemangioma, arterial abnormalities, cardiac abnormalities, eye abnormalities, and/or sternal cleft or defect. 1 has been reported in patients with segmental facial hemangiomas as well as in those with isolated, focal hemangiomas 1 (Fig. 14) . The workup consists of MRI and MR angiography of neck and brain, echocardiogram, and an ophthalmologic assessment. 1 Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of numerous cutaneous and visceral hemangiomas that manifest at birth or within the neonatal period. The cutaneous lesions are generalized, vary from 0.5 to 1.5 cm in diameter, and range from 50 to 500 in number. Visceral lesions are most commonly found in the liver, central nervous system, intestine, and lungs. Skeletal involvement has also been reported. Approximately 60% of infants with diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis die during the first few months of life owing to high-output cardiac failure, hemorrhage, or central nervous system involvement. 1 Steroid therapy is thought to accelerate involution of diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis lesions. 15 Management of hemangiomas depends on extent and location of involvement; initially, watchful waiting is often reasonable, because the majority of these lesions resolve spontaneously and the disease process is benign. 1 However, for hemangiomas that are deforming, impair function, or are ulcerated, propranolol (Inderal) has become the first line of therapy with vasoconstriction as the therapeutic objective. 1 This agent should be used in caution in patients with PHACES syndrome. 1 Additional treatment modalities for congenital hemangiomas include topical timolol gel, intralesional steroid injections, chemotherapeutic agents, and laser treatments. Hemangiomas involving the neck and face, although benign, can lead to parental stress, fear, and grief. This factor should be considered when caring for patients with facial hemangioma and their families.",

Hodgkin lymphoma is more common in older children. 1 Hodgkin lymphoma is a neoplastic disease of the lymphatic cell line and is distinguished histologically from non-Hodgkin lymphoma by its characteristic Reed-Sternberg cells. 19 Swollen, rubbery, nontender lymph nodes are frequently the most noticeable initial sign. 19 Histologic examination reveals Hodgkin and multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells and multicolor lymphocytic reactions. 19 Anamnesis and clinical examination provide diagnostic indicators; staging is performed as in non-Hodgkin lymphoma with imaging, bone marrow aspiration, and histologic evidence of biopsied tissue. 19 Chemotherapy and, if applicable, radiotherapy are used as treatment options, according to the stage of the disease. 19 Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic disorders of the lymphatic cell, which affects B-cell and T-cell lymphocytes. 19 The etiology is considered to be hereditary or acquired genetic defects leading to a mismatch of proliferation and apoptosis of cells in the lymphatic system. 19 Lymph node swelling and general symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and night sweats are the predominant manifestations. 19 Patients additionally often exhibit fatigue, weakness, and changes in blood count. 19 The swollen lymph nodes are usually firm and nontender, and may be unilateral or bilateral. 19 Biopsy for histologic evaluation with special immune staining and bone marrow aspiration are necessary for diagnosis. Imaging is useful in staging the disease, including chest radiographs, CT scans, and ultrasound imaging of the neck, thorax, and abdomen. 19 Treatment is based on the stage and entity and may include chemotherapy, radiation, and/or antibody therapy. 19 Neuroblastoma Neuroblastoma is the most common head and neck malignancy in children less than 5 years of age, and it is the most common malignancy diagnosed during the first month after birth. 1 It can be associated with Horner syndrome and cranial neuropathies, as well as airway obstruction or dysphagia, because neuroblastomas arise in the neural crest progenitor cells of the sympathetic nervous system. 1 Treatment involves surgery and radiation for stage A disease (confinement to the nasal cavity). Stages B, C, or D disease (paranasal sinus involvement, extension to skull base, and distant metastasis including cervical lymph nodes, respectively) warrants surgery, radiation, and possibly postoperative chemotherapy. 1",

In a pediatric otolaryngology practice, more unusual pathologies are encountered, such as embryologic anomalies, vascular lesions, or neoplasms. Normal lymph nodes are more easily palpable in children with thin necks, and benign-appearing lymph nodes in children are typically not considered for biopsy unless they are 3 cm or greater in size. Lesions that are larger or that have concerning features will ultimately need imaging and excisional biopsy for histopathologic confirmation of the diagnosis. A sound clinician understanding of anatomic neck spaces and common etiologies of pediatric neck masses can greatly reduce nonessential testing, cost, delay in treatment, and parental angst.",
