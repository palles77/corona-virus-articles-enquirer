For the Runx2 and osteocalcin (OCN) immunochemical staining, the sections were stained using the Vectastain ABC Kit and the DAB Substrate Kit for peroxidase. Briefly, sections were predigested in 0.5 mg/mL hyaluronidase for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C and incubated in 0.5 N acetic acid for 4 h at 4 \u00b0C to swell the samples prior to overnight incubation with primary antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-collagen type I (Takara), at dilutions of 1:200. Non-immune controls underwent the sample procedure without primary antibody incubation. The femoral head samples were bisected along the coronal plane including the trochanteric region. Half of each bisected region was decalcified and embedded in paraffin while the other half was embedded in methyl methacrylate (MMA) without decalcification. The decalcified sections with a thickness of 5 \u00b5m were cut and subjected to HE to evaluate the newly formed bone under a light microscope. Immunofluorescence staining was used to determine the expression of Osterix and Runx2. Sequential fluorescence labeling was used for the evaluation of the new bone formation rate as previously reported. MMA sections of 10 \u00b5m thickness were used for Goldner's Trichrome staining, according to our established protocol 4 .",
