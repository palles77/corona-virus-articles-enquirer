However, it is unclear which viral gene causes these effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein on PK-15 cells. We found that TGEV N protein suppressed cell proliferation by causing cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases and apoptosis. Characterization of various cellular proteins that are involved in regulating cell cycle progression demonstrated that the expression of N gene resulted in an accumulation of p53 and p21, which suppressed cyclin B1, cdc2 and cdk2 expression. Moreover, the expression of TGEV N gene promoted translocation of Bax to mitochondria, which in turn caused the release of cytochrome c, followed by activation of caspase-3, resulting in cell apoptosis in the transfected PK-15 cells following cell cycle arrest. Further studies showed that p53 inhibitor attenuated TGEV N protein induced cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases and apoptosis through reversing the expression changes of cdc2, cdk2 and cyclin B1 and the translocation changes of Bax and cytochrome c induced by TGEV N protein. Taken together, these results demonstrated that TGEV N protein might play an important role in TGEV infection-induced p53 activation and cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases and apoptosis occurrence.",

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpr activates cell cycle inhibitor p21 to prevent cell proliferation by causing arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle [16] . Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 1 E4 protein induces G2/M arrest through inhibition or delay in the activation of cdk1/cyclin B1 kinase activity [17] . Chicken anemic virus (CAV) apoptin protein and Herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) ICP0 protein can interfere with kinetochores to block cell cycle progression at G2/M phase [18, 19] . Previous studies have revealed that the TGEV N could locate nucleolar and might function to disrupt cell division [9] . Here, our results showed that expression of TGEV N protein activated p53 and up-regulated cell cycle inhibitor p21, and then inhibited the activation of cdc2/cyclin B1, leading to G2/M arrest, which was consistent with our previous results found in TGEV-infected cells [6] , suggesting that TGEV N protein might play an important role in TGEV-induced cell cycle arrest. In previous studies, we found TGEV infection induces S and G2/M arrest, which is aimed to establish a pseudo-S phase state for viruses to replicate of their genomes [6] . The results presented in here also provided evidences for S phase arrest and following G2/M arrest, suggesting that TGEV N protein might play an important role in establishing a pseudo-S phase state for virus replication. The same phenomena were also found in other viruses [20] .",

Infectious bursal disease virus VP5 [21] , Rubella virus capsid protein [22] , Hepatitis C virus core protein [23] , and Japanese encephalitis virus NS2B-NS3 [24] have been shown to induce apoptosis alone in cell culture and play an important role in viral pathogenesis. Over the past few years, studies report multifaceted roles for the viral N protein in trafficking, translation and in modulation of immune signaling. Previous studies have indicated that TGEV N protein underwent caspase-mediated proteolysis during TGEV-induced apoptosis [8] . In this study, we further investigated its function in modulation of apoptosis and demon-strated that TGEV N protein was capable of inducing apoptosis in the transfected PK-15 cells, which might be important for the pathogenesis of TGEV.",

In the present study, we also found that p53 was activated to induce the change of apoptotic and cell cycle regulating factors such as cdc2, cdk2, cyclinB1, Bax and Cyt c in TGEV N protein expressed PK-15 cells.
