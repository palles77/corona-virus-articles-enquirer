The need for a group to advise WHO specifically on vaccine product development was highlighted, to accelerate vaccine availability and ensure accessibility of vaccines to low and middle income countries (LMICs). PDVAC's remit is to advise on the product development strategy of vaccine candidates at phase II of clinical evaluation or earlier, and to report its proceedings to the WHO's principal committee on immunization policy recommendations: the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE). The PDVAC committee has a critical role in assessing the evolving vaccine development landscape and in helping to define where and how WHO can be most impactful, according to three criteria: Likelihood of a product emerging from the pipeline, as defined by probability of technical and regulatory success, and the extent of awareness, activity and investment in a given area, A clear role for WHO with perceived added value for engagement in the pathogen area.",

PPCs define WHO preferences for the properties of vaccines to be used in LMICs that are 5-10 years from licensure, and inform target product profiles in use by manufacturers and funders for vaccines. PDVAC also encourages developers to be aware of the process and requirements for WHO prequalification (PQ). WHO Prequalification is a service to UNICEF and other UN agencies that purchase vaccines once they have been licensed, to determine the acceptability, in principle, of vaccines from different sources for supply to these agencies. It aims to ensure that diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and immunizationrelated equipment and devices for high burden diseases meet global standards of quality, safety and efficacy, and are appropriate for use in LMICs contexts in order to optimize the potential benefit of these interventions [1] .",

The report highlights the urgent need to reduce reliance on currently available antimicrobials, without which today's 700,000 deaths per year from drug resistant microbes is forecasted to increase to 10 million, by 2050. The cost in terms of lost global production due to infections that are not controllable due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is estimated to be $100 trillion by 2050 if no action is taken [2] . The development of vaccines against pathogens that are currently controlled by antimicrobials has become an imperative, as they have the potential to reduce the prevalence and spread of drug resis-tance, as well as to reduce the use of antimicrobials more broadly [3] .",

Approximately 480,000 cases/annum are multi-drug resistant (MDR) or extensively drug resistant (XDR) and some strains are untreatable. In 2014, six million new cases of Mtb were reported to WHO, fewer than two-thirds (63%) of the 9.6 million people estimated to have contracted the disease. This means that 37% of new cases were not detected or reported. A vaccine is imperative to achieving the End TB goals [12] , particularly through reaching the population who are undiagnosed and continue to transmit disease. As such, the TB vaccine development community has turned its focus to the development of vaccines targeted to adolescents and adults as the age-groups with highest burden of active disease and the source of Mtb transmission. Modelling studies suggest that prevention of pulmonary disease in this population from primary infection and from reinfection or reactivation of existing infections is the most effective strategy to prevent Mtb infection and disease in infants and children [13] . The most advanced vaccine candidates are targeting this indication, including current neonatal BCG replacement candidate vaccines that are also undergoing evaluation as a booster in later life. Several of these candidates are in proof-of-concept clinical studies and are approaching key endpoints through prevention of infection or disease, or prevention of disease due to reinfection in this these target populations in the next 12-24 months [14] . With this in mind, PDVAC recommended that WHO prioritize and facilitate consensus building with respect to the development of strategic goal(s) and PPC(s) for vaccines targeted to adolescents and adults, in the first instance. There are several candidates and platforms in the pipeline that target this goal in this population, as well as other important target populations [4] . PDVAC acknowledged the significant need for development for these vaccines in parallel, as well as continued efforts to understand the biological mechanism of disease to support the immunological rationalization of candidates.",

The interim data from a phase I/ II study (HVTN 100) met its humoral and cellular immunological 'go' criteria, exceeding the RV144 responses against sub-Saharan clade C antigens. Extrapolation of these responses to those observed with RV144, suggest that the optimised vaccine could offer at least 50% protection following a 12 month booster. Based on these data, a randomised placebo controlled phase IIb/III efficacy trial (HVTN702) enrolling 5400 subjects was initiated in late 2016 in South Africa, and will evaluate ALVAC (clade C) prime/ bivalent recombinant gp120 protein with MF59 adjuvant as a heterologous boost, as well as the effect of a booster at 12 months [16] . Futility analyses will be undertaken early in the 2 year followup period. Correlate of protection studies and assessment of crossreactivity to other regional clades are included in the study design. Discussions with the South African Medicines Control Council (MCC) are ongoing, and licensure in South Africa could be as early as 2021.",

In the US alone, it is believed to have caused approximately 0.5 million infections and 29,000 deaths in 2012 [26] . Current interventions include antibiotic treatments, but their use can trigger relapse on withdrawal. Data on the burden of disease in LMICs is lacking, however hospital based studies in India, Thailand and South Korea suggest that the C. difficile infection is widespread, and global (Douce, manuscript in preparation).",

For example, it has been shown that the use of PCV-7 in children results in a roughly 50% reduction in antibiotic-resistant strains of S. pneumonia, and the use of PCV-10 reduces outpatient antibiotic purchase, leading to the suggestion that global pediatric coverage with PCV could prevent 11 million days of antibiotic use in children annually. However, it is thought that the bulk of pneumonia, and antibiotic use for S. pneumonia infections, is in older adults. This would suggest that demonstrating efficacy of pneumonia vaccines to reduce antibiotic use in older adults and an expanded use of these vaccines in that population group where very few countries have a vaccination policy may have a substantial impact on reducing AMR. Other existing vaccines which could impact antibiotic use include pertussis, Haemophilus influenza, Neisseria meningitides, typhoid, as well as influenza which, although not directly susceptible to antibiotic treatment, does result in bacterial super-infections and accounts for up to 30% of excess (winter-related) antibiotic prescriptions in some countries. In order for a rational evidence-based policy on expanding the use of existing vaccines a prioritization exercise needs to be performed, taking into account the disease burden in different populations, the antibiotic use associated with that disease burden, and an evaluation of how many days of antibiotic use would be avoided with each dose of vaccine administered. This exercise is particularly challenging since in most of the world antibiotics are taken in response to a symptom, rather than an identified infection. This means that, for example, preventing Salmonella typhi-induced infection with vaccines may have minimal impact on antibiotic use for severe diarrhea. The prioritization exercise therefore needs to consider not only the disease burden, but the symptom burden and the proportion of that burden due to the vaccine-preventable infection. b). Developing vaccines for diseases that are consistently treated with antibiotics, where AMR is not currently an issue, but where the vaccine could reduce antibiotic use. One such example is Group A Streptococcus (GAS). While GAS is not directly associated with antibiotic resistance (there is little evidence of resistance to date) it has a high disease burden and is a source of extensive antibiotic use. In addition, it is thought that vaccine development is feasible. However to date there has been no significant effort from industry, possibly because of the weak market assessment since it can be treated with antibiotics, and such treatment is cheap. However the indirect costs from such antibiotic use, increased environmental exposure to antibiotics and expansion of AMR have not been considered. Taking these costs into account may contribute to the value proposition for developing and using such a vaccine. Other such candidates could include Group B streptococcus, and M. catarhalis and non-typeable Haemophilus influenza, both responsible for otitis media which is another source of significant antibiotic prescription. While including potential impact on reduction of antibiotic use, prioritization of these candidate vaccines also needs to consider technical feasibility, whether the antibiotic use is appropriate, and whether alternative non-antibiotic approaches may make vaccine use less attractive. For example: while there are over 700 million cases of otitis media per year in under -5 year olds, for which antibiotic treatment is usually prescribed which could justify development of a vaccine, most otitis media resolves and new guidelines recommend limiting antibiotic treatment. Another example is urinary tract infections which are frequent in elderly patients and a cause of significant antibiotic use, yet there is little supporting evidence that these infections could be effectively reduced by vaccination. A prioritization exercise is therefore required for vaccines that are considered technically feasible, takes into account the potential AMR impact, and therefore could contribute to the cost effectiveness of the vaccine if they were developed. To achieve this, the evaluation of impact on AMR is recommended to be included in the review of vaccine conducted by PDVAC. c). The third and most challenging approach is developing vaccines against pathogens that are frequently antibiotic resistant and becoming increasingly difficult to treat, the so-called ESKAPE pathogens [39] . This list includes Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, as well as Clostridium difficile and tuberculosis. There are numerous challenges in this approach. The first is that although infection with these may result in significant morbidity, the current global disease burden of many of these infections remains relatively low so prophylactic vaccination of the entire population would not be cost-effective. Tuberculosis is however an example with significant disease burden and rapidly expanding multi-drug resistance. Secondly many of these infections are associated with ageing, where immune decline may make immune interventions poorly effective, or are associated with penetrative medical interventions where the time available to induce a protective immune response may be insufficient. And finally, despite significant efforts to make effective vaccines against some of these has so far proven to be difficult. Of these, tuberculosis appears to have the greatest global burden and public health impact, and TB vaccines are also the subject of extensive research. The AMR GAP activity in this area, to be conducted by IVR is firstly to promote TB vaccine research and development through facilitation of Preferred Product Characteristics and the establishment of a roadmap for vaccine use, and highlighting the impact that the vaccine will have on antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance. Additional activities involve monitoring the state of development of vaccines against the pathogens that are becoming antibiotic resistance, and facilitating their development.",

GAS is also a major cause of invasive disease, with a case fatality rate of 10-15% in high income countries, and as high as 38% in LMICs [40] . On the milder end of the spectrum, GAS causes approx. 615 million cases of pharyngitis per year, resulting in 60-70% of cases being treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, rather than penicillin (9% of cases), to which GAS is universally susceptible.

Despite this encouraging progress, significant debate remains as to the appropriate indication and optimal clinical endpoints, and the regulatory pathway for a vaccine to prevent or reduce RHD is unclear.

In the face of another PHEIC so soon following Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, the global vaccine community is rallying, and reflecting on lessons learned from the experience in West Africa only 2 years ago. At the time of responding to the EVD emergency, the availability of well-characterised pre-clinical models and robust data was essential for the comparative evaluation and selection of candidates to move into clinical studies. Novel recombinant viral vector platforms, in combination with recombination proteins have been validated by EVD experience and it could be argued are now less risky for development of vaccine against future pathogens, but manufacturing feasibility and scale-up capabilities still need to be confirmed for the most novel platforms. Critically, sustainable public sector push and pull investment mechanisms beyond the initial emergency response phase need to be created, to incentivise manufacturers to engage in the long term commitment to developing and licensing vaccines that may only be used in outbreak or emergency scenarios.",

One of the reasons for this striking immunization gap is the cost and logistical challenges of delivery of these vaccines, over and above the cost of their manufacture. The remit of WHO's Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (IPAC) is to provide strategic advice on immunization practices, tools, and technologies intended to improve the delivery of immunization programs at the country level. It oversees the recently formed delivery technologies working group (DTWG) composed of public health organizations, funders and procurement agencies as well as vaccine developers to evaluate R&D in novel delivery technologies and devices, for example the microarray patch, and compact, pre-filled auto-disable injection technologies (cPAD). Of particular focus for this group is the development and evaluation of a framework to analyze high-level trade-offs between important variables such as development, procurement and supply chain costs, coverage, efficacy, and safety in order to facilitate investment decisions by product developers, vaccine manufacturers, global policy makers, in-country decision makers and procurement agencies. This framework is referred to as total systems effectiveness (TSE). The intent of this delivery technology working group is to offer a platform for discussion and guidance regarding vaccine preferences for LMICs, early on in development, so that ultimately the vaccine is suitable for programmatic use. The DTWG reports directly to IPAC, but has potential overlap with activities that are overseen by PDVAC, particularly in consideration of second generation vaccines or new vaccines that may be developed with an alternative presentation to that of a needle and syringe.",

One such pathogen is Cytomegalovirus (CMV), which is a leading cause of congenital infections worldwide, resulting in 17-20% of infants developing permanent sequelae including hearing loss and neurodevelopmental disabilities. There are little data on CMV infection in LMICs, but a recent systemic review suggests that birth prevalence ranges are higher in LMICs than in Europe and North America [60] , and several clinical trials of vaccine candidates are ongoing. As such, an assessment of CMV vaccine development will be undertaken by PDVAC 2017.",
