More distally in the tracheobronchial tree, bronchi are differentiated from bronchioles by the presence of cartilage in bronchial walls.

The advantages of CT include excellent spatial resolution and the ability to generate multiplanar reformats and three dimensional (3D) reconstructions, CT allows for rapid and noninvasive evaluation of the tracheobronchial tree. Importantly, with current CT detectors, the spatial resolution is preserved in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Multidetector computed tomography is an excellent diagnostic tool to find, localize, and investigate the extent of airway pathologies with both local and distant disease involvement.
