In our study, because the gilt pool was so large, a nonimmune subpopulation very likely existed and might have acted as a potential source of virus multiplication. The severity of clinical signs such as vomiting, emaciation, wasting, and death was greater than that previously reported (10) . Factors that might have enhanced the clinical manifestations of the disease were a nonimmune population and the winter season (3, 8, 10) .",
