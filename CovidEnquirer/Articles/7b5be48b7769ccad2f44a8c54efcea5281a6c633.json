            "text": "20 BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has 21 spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly 22 influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its 23 control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in 24 China. fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of 29 population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; 30 City r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; City r=0.6358, p<0.001). 31 The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with 32 reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was 33 inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p <0.001) and infection rates (r =-0.4912, p <0.01). 34 Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r =-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure 35 rates (r = 0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. 36 CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily 37 to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and 38 adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved 39 prognosis of affected individuals.",

In response to the situation, 53 unprecedented measures have been taken by central and local government to contain the outbreak 54 and prevent its further spread across China.

Subsequently, major cities within Hubei province started to implement lockdown on Jan 26 th 58 or 27 th , 2020, except the remote Shennongjia Forestry District due to the very limited number of 59 COVID-19 cases.

We showed that the rapid spread of the COVID-19 epidemic across China was 191 strongly associated with the mass population movement out of Hubei province, particularly Wuhan 192 city, before the Chinese Lunar New year, which was subsequently disrupted effectively by the total193 lockdown of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei provinces. Although there were variations in the pace 194 of control across different regions of China, the epidemic outside of Hubei province was contained 195 rapidly and effectively through various public health emergency measures. As well as public health 196 measures, local capacity including the number of public health staff and available medical resources 197 also played important roles in control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals. 198 The first case of novel COVID-19 infection was reported during early December 2019 and it was not 199 publicly acknowledged until 20 January 2020 that the virus could be transmitted from human to 200 human, which triggered rapid and drastic public health measures both in Hubei and rest of China to 201 try to contain the spread of virus. The total lockdown of Wuhan city on 23 rd January 2020, followed 202 by other cities in Hubei a few days later, appeared too late to prevent the epidemic from spreading 203 into other regions of China, for by then over 5 million people had already left Wuhan. However, 204 without such drastic measures, the situation could be much worse. The data from Baidu Migration 205 Map showed that mass population movements out of Wuhan and Hubei province took place not only 206 before but throughout the whole of Chinese Lunar New Year period. Based on comparison with 2019 207 data, without lockdown an additional 15 million people could have traveled from Wuhan to other 208 regions (and overseas) plus similar or even larger number who would have travelled from other 209 regions to Wuhan. Moreover, there would have been massive internal population movement within 210 Wuhan and other cities in Hubei during the same period, further exacerbating the epidemic. 211 Expectedly the severity of COVID-19 epidemic outside of Hubei province, especially during the 212 initial phase, was strongly related to the scale of inward population movements from Wuhan. 213 However, the epidemic was rapidly brought under control in most areas by introduction of various 214 public health emergency measures, as demonstrated by decrease of the daily number of confirmed 215 cases starting from the 1 st or 2 nd week of February and the lack of clear correlation between S/P ratio 216 and number of total confirmed cases. Despite this, the pace with which the epidemic was contained 217 varied across different areas as assessed by various parameters examined, including S/P ratio, the 218 daily growth rate of secondary cases and lag time.

Similarly, in Zhejiang province, doctors can pre-screen suspected patient through the 222 internet application, which greatly reduce the probability of hospital transmission. Moreover, using 223 cloud computing facilities and integrated big data platform, public health doctors in Zhejiang 224 province was also able to cross-examine every suspected case. These measures have contributed 225 importantly to a sharp and continual downward trend in the number infected after Jan 30 th , 2020. On 226 the other hand, in several other areas (eg, Heilongjiang and Tianjin) there were prolonged delays in 227 containing the epidemic, reflecting probably less effective local measures in controlling the epidemic. 228 For example, in Heilongjiang, the S/P ratio approached 11, which was the highest across all regions 229 outside of Hubei, suggesting nearly 90 percent of the confirmed cases resulted from family gatherings. 230 The regional variations in the pace of epidemic containment was also evident by comparison of the 231 mean lag time between primary and secondary cases. Overall the mean lag time was about 1 week, 232 with particularly low value in Jiangsu (~ 4 days) and Henan (~5 days), and particularly high value in 233 Heilongjiang (~13 days) and Tianjin (~17 days). Henan is a neighboring province of Hubei with a 234 total population of 100 million people and extensive transport connections with Wuhan. In 235 recognition of forthcoming epidemic, the Henan provincial government introduced strong measures 236 to greatly reduce and restrict public transport from Wuhan areas into Henan even before the total 237 lockdown of the Wuhan city. 238 Although the COVID-19 shared many similar epidemiological features to those of SARS in 2003 16 , 239 it appeared to be much less deadly 20,21 , with the overall case fatality rate of less than 3% as opposed 240 to ~10% for SARS. However, there was great difference in the case fatality rates between Hubei, 241 particularly Wuhan and rest of the China. As the epicenter of COVID-19 outbreak, medical and health 242 services in Hubei Province were overwhelmed and ill prepared for such a rapid and substantial 243 increase in the number of infected cases, leading to poor and inadequate management of patients, 244 hence poor prognosis. Apart from difference in the capacity of medical services, other factors, 245 including age of people affected and proportion with other comorbidities may also contribute to the 246 higher case fatality observed in Wuhan and Hubei.
