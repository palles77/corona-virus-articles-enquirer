The receptor for the major group has been identified as the intercellular adhesion molecule-l (ICAM-lf) (Greve et al., 1989; Staunton et al., 1989) . The major group of rhinoviruses includes human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14), whose three-dimensional atomic structure has been determined (Rossmann et al., 1985) , as well as HRV16, whose structure is being determined (M. A. Oliveira, M. G. Rossmann, W. M. Lee & R. R. Rueckert, unpublished results). The minor rhinovirus group includes HRVlA, whose structure is known (Kim et al., 1989) . The surface structures of homologous HRV14 and HRVlA differ in their charge distribution, but both show a large surface canyon that is thought to be the site of receptor attachment (Rossmann et aZ., 1985; Rossmann, 1989 ). Solvent exposed residues within the canyon are more conserved (Rossmann & Palmenberg, 1988) and would be inaccessible to larger antibodies, thus conserving the receptor attachment site in the face of host immune pressure for change in the antigenic viral surface. Support for this hypothesis comes from site-specific mutagenesis al., 1988; Giranda et al., 1990) suggests that ICAM-is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily.",
