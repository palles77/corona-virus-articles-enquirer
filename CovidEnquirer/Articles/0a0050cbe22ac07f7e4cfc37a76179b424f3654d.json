The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. Methods: In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike. Results: Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain \u03b2 (SBD\u03b2). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBD\u03b2 of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. Conclusions:",

For GRP78, the active site residues are retrieved from previous work to be I426, T428, V429, V432, T434, F451, S452, V457, and I459. Figures 4A and 4B show the binding mode for each of the docking trials (the best-formed complexes from each docking experiment) with green cartoon representing GRP78 and yellow cartoon representing the homo-trimeric COVID-19 spike. All the docking trials proved the possibility of fitting the GRP78 SBD\u03b2 to the spike with binding affinities (predicted by PRODIGY) ranging from -9.8 up to -14 kcal/mol. In terms of the orientation of the two interacting proteins, regions III and IV are accepted to be the docking platform. In these two trials, the GRP78 and spike can interact in a head-to-head fashion. Table 1 Figure 5A shows the predicted binding mode of the GRP78 (cyan surface) to the spike of the newly emerged coronavirus (green surface) using region IV of the spike (red surface) as the docking platform. The interacting residues of GRP78 and the spike proteins are shown in yellow and red, respectively. The enlarged panel shows in more detail the interacting residues of GRP78 (yellow sticks) and the region IV of the spike (red cartoon) labeled with its one-letter codes. This binding mode is acceptable since the two proteins are interacting, as when the virus is approaching the target cell (respiratory system cells) expressing its cell-surface receptor, GRP78. The predicted binding site of the Spike protein to GRP7 found in this study is in good agreement with studies that identified the spike receptor-binding domain using antibodies 23, 41 . ",

A vast amount of host cell receptors are targets for viruses, including the cell-surface GRP78. Inhibiting the interaction that occurs between the COVID-19 spike protein and the host cell receptor GRP78 would probably decrease the rate of viral infection. Furthermore, a vaccine against the COVID-19 spike protein would likely prevent viral infection. The present in silico perspective suggests the existence of a COVID-19 spike protein-GRP78 binding site, thus paving the route for drug designers to develop suitable inhibitors to prevent the binding and hence the infection.
