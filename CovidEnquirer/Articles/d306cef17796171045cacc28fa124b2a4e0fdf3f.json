Furthermore, since in such in vitro primary cultures a \"time clock\" of development follows the same sequence as that which occurs in viva (McCarthy and De Vellis, 1980; Abney et a& 1981 ; Barbarese and Pfeiffer, 1981; Bhat et al, 1981; Bologa-Sondru et al, 1981) such cultures may be used to better define the virus-glial cell interactions involved in the development of disease in the CNS. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and viruses. L-2 mouse fibroblasts (Rothfels et aL, 1959) were routinely propagated in Eagle's MEM (GIBCO, Grand Island, N.Y.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained in a 37\" humid environment containing 5% COe. The MHV3 and JHMV strains of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were propagated and plaque assayed on L-2 mouse fibroblasts as follows: subconfluent cultures of L-2 cells were absorbed for 1 hr at room temperature with either virus at a m.o.i. of 1 PFU per cell. Cultures were then shifted to 37\" until 50% of cells had lifted off. The remainder of the monolayer was then scraped using a rubber policeman and passed through a syringe fitted with a 21gauge needle. The resulting lysate was then sedimented at 2000 rpm for 10 min in an IEC centrifuge to remove cellular debris and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 22,000 rpm for 60 min to sediment the virus. The pelleted virus was resuspended in a small volume of MEM plus 10% FBS and stored at -70'. Infectious virus was quantitated by plaque assays, as previously described by Lucas et al. (1977) .",

The influence of differentiation on replication of the two coronavirus strains was tested by treating cultures enriched for astrocytes or oligodendrocytes with dbcAMP for various periods, as indicated in Table  4 . It is evident from the results summarized in this Table that exposure of astrocytes to dbcAMP for 9 or 14 days affected coronavirus replication to a variable degree, reducing JHMV either not at all or to about 20% of the controls, while MHV3 yields were diminished to about 20 and 8%, respectively. By contrast either zero or almost no virus of either strain was generated by oligodendrocytes exposed to dbcAMP for 11, 15, or 20 days. Controls, using VW showed that prolonged treatment of oligodendrocytes with dbcAMP had no effect on replication of this agent. Although the murine oligodendrocytes treated for 9 days or longer with dbcAMP were not checked for expression of coronavirus antigens, surveys of rat oligodendrocytes revealed that treatment for 48 hr abolished production of JHMV antigens. Thus, in agreement with data from the rat model, coronavirus replication is blocked a Twenty-four hours before the days indicated in the first column cultures were infected and then sampled 24 hr later for PFU in the culture supernatant. The discrepancy between virus titers from oligodendrocyte cultures shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4 is most probably due to the much less efficient replication of virus in cultures of low density, containing 10' or fewer cells per well, as noted by Beushausen and Dales (1935) .",

The differential adhesiveness enabled us to obtain cultures that are almost entirely astrocytes or highly enriched in oligodendrocytes. Challenge with the neurotropic coronavi-rus JHMV and viscerotropic MHV3 showed that both strains can be replicated with equal facility in murine astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.

In the mouse, however, both JHMV and MHV, induce neurological disease and, depending on the genetic endowment, this species may remain susceptible to coronavirus even beyond 1 year of age (Lampert et ah, 1973; Weiner, 1973; Herndon et aL, 1975; Hirano et aL, 1981; Stohlman and Weiner, 1981; Sorensen et aL, 1982) .

As found with rat cells, the process of murine oligodendrocyte differentiation is closely correlated with absence of virus production, in this case involving both JHMV and MHV3. By contrast, dbcAMP treatment has much less influence on replication of these coronavirus in mouse astrocytes, again consistent with the previous finding that this inducer has limited effect on production of MHV3 in rat astrocytes (Beushausen and . The observed reduction in virus yield from cultures of astrocytes treated with dbcAMP might be due to a slower effect on astrocyte differentiation thereby allowing production of coronaviruses.

This finding might be related to differences in age between rats and mice when myelination is complete and also to the time interval when the animals remain susceptible to CNS disease caused by coronaviruses. In mice the prolonged susceptibility to disease caused by infection is in line with an extended time period during which CNPase induction and myelination occur (Kurihara et aL, 1970; Morel1 et aL, 1972 , Barbarese et aL, 1978 and is consistent with the long time required to obtain maximum CNPase induction in vitro, as shown in Fig. 4 . By contrast, the unusually sensitive (Sorensen et aL, 1980) , Wistar-Furth rats remain susceptible for only about 15-21 days, to disease caused by JHMV, which is coincident with the completion of myelination and CNPase induction in vivo (Sprinkle et al, 1978) and in vitro (Abney et aL, 1981; Barbarese and Pfeiffer, 1981; McMorris, 1983) . These findings focus further on the possible relevance of age-related oligodendrocyte maturation in the CNS and susceptibility to disease within the CNS caused by coronaviruses.",

Our recent investigations using cDNA probes have, in fact, shown by in situ hybridization that latent JHMV can be maintained for prolonged periods in the cytoplasm of neurons within specific areas of the rat brain, particularly in the hippocampus (Sorensen and Dales, 1985) , suggesting that neurons may function as repositories of latent and persistent infections. The relative importance of oligodendrocytes versus the other neural cell types in the disease process must await future elucidation.",
