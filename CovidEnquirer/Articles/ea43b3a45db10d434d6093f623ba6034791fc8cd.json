The type and degree of the immune defect dictate the profile of potential opportunistic pathogens; T-cell-mediated defects increase the risk of viral (cytomegalovirus, respiratory viruses) and Pneumocystis jirovecii infections, whereas neutrophil defects are associated with bacterial pneumonia and invasive aspergillosis. However, patients often have combinations of immune defects, and a wide range of other opportunistic infections can cause pneumonia. Importantly, conventional non-opportunistic pathogens are frequently encountered in immunocompromised hosts and should not be overlooked. The radiological pattern of disease (best assessed by computed tomography) and speed of onset help to identify the likely pathogen(s); radiological imaging can subsequently be supported by targeted investigation including the early use of bronchoscopy in selected patients. Rapid and expert clinical assessment can identify the most likely pathogens, which can then be treated aggressively, providing the best opportunity for a positive clinical outcome.",

The type and degree of immune defect dictate which potential opportunistic pathogens are likely (Table 1) . Opportunistic lung infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients immunocompromised because of HIV infection, haematological malignancy, aplastic anaemia or chemotherapy treatment, or who are recipients of solid-organ or stem cell transplants, and also can complicate treatment with the new biological therapies for inflammatory conditions. Immunocompromised patients also have an increased risk of infections caused by more conventional pathogens, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Expert clinical assessment with early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are required for a positive outcome. Computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive than plain chest radiography for defining the predominant pattern(s) of lung involvement. Combined with knowledge of the patient's immune status (loss of T-cell or antibody-mediated immunity, or defects in neutrophil-mediated immunity), this can often identify the most likely pathogens. This article provides a concise overview of the most common opportunistic lung infections.",

Aspergillus has a predilection for growing into blood vessels, potentially causing fatal massive haemorrhage. Chest radiographs show patchy infiltrates or nodules that can cavitate. CT features include macronodules (single or multiple, with or without cavitation) or patchy consolidation. Nodules can show the 'halo' (surrounding ground-glass infiltrates caused by haemorrhage) or 'air-crescent' (cavitation around a fungal ball) signs. When the patient's immune function recovers, fungal balls can form in a walled-off cavity created by the invasive phase of the disease. Other manifestations of invasive Aspergillus infections affecting the lung include: Aspergillus tracheobronchitis, in which infection is restricted to the tracheobronchial tree, causing a relentless cough. CT may show focal bronchial wall thickening and 'tree-in-bud' changes. Bronchoscopy is diagnostic, identifying highly inflamed mucosa with necrotic white slough that is positive for Aspergillus on culture and histology. Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA) or chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA), which are more indolent forms of invasive aspergillosis associated with mild immunosuppression or chronic lung disease. These present with a long history of cough and frequently with marked systemic symptoms. There is also a slowly progressive patch of consolidation with or without cavitation (CNPA) or an expanding dry upper lobe cavity with a thickened wall (CCPA). Diagnosis of IPA is suggested by detection of galactomannan (a relatively specific cell wall component) or b-D-glucan (a cell wall component of many fungi including Aspergillus and Pneumocystis) antigen in blood or BALF. False-positives galactomannan antigen results occur with concomitant treatment with b-lactam antibiotics. Definitive diagnosis of IPA is made by positive culture for Aspergillus and histopathological demonstration of tissue invasion on CT-guided or VATS biopsy specimens. Histology is highly sensitive, showing dichotomous (45 ) branching of septated hyphae on Gomori methenamine silver or periodic acideSchiff staining. However, histology specimens are often unavailable, and culture is relatively insensitive, so diagnosis is frequently made on clinical grounds (suggestive CT appearances, high-risk patient, with or without a positive galactomannan test). Aspergillus antibodies have no role in the diagnosis of IPA but are positive in CCPA and sometimes in CNPA. There has been a worldwide increase in A. fumigatus resistance to azoles, 4 and treatment with a combination of an azole and an echinocandin antifungal agent may be necessary in immunocompromised hosts with severe IPA.",
