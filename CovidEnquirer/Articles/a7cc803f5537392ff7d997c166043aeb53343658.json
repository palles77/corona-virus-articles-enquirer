Macrophages play a central role in the pathogenesis of MHV-3-induced hepatitis. In the present study we have shown that MHV-3 infection of macrophages induces these cells to undergo apoptosis. Three methods to detect apoptosis were applied: flow cytometry analysis of nuclear DNA content, fluorescence microscopic visualization of apoptotic cells labeled by the TUNEL assay, and gel electrophoresis to detect DNA laddering. Apoptosis in A/J and BALB/c macrophages was first detected at 8 h postinfection (p.i.) and reached a maximum by 12 h p.i. The degree of MHV-3-induced apoptosis was much greater in A/J-derived macrophages than in BALB/c-derived cells. Apoptosis was inversely correlated with the development of typical MHV cytopathology, namely syncytia formation. Infected macrophages from A/J mice did not form synctia in contrast to the extensive synctia formation observed in BALB/c-derived macrophages. In MHV-3-infected BALB/c macrophage cultures, apoptotic cells were not incorporated into syncytia. Apoptosis was also inversely correlated with the expression of MHV-3-induced fgl2 prothrombinase in macrophages. These results add the murine coronavirus MHV-3 to the list of RNA-containing viruses capable of inducing apoptosis.",

DNAcontaining viruses that induce apoptosis include adenoviruses (Rao et al., 1992; Chiou et al., 1994; Antoni et al., 1995) , Epstein\u00b1Barr virus (Gregory et al., 1994) , and poxviruses (Ray et al., 1992; Hu et al., 1994) . Several RNAcontaining viruses have also been reported to induce apoptosis: these include polioviruses (Tolskaya et al., 1995b) , Sindbis virus (Levine et al., 1993; Esolen et al., 1995) , reovirus (Tyler et al., 1995) , and influenza viruses (Takizawa et al., 1993; Fesq et al., 1994) . Apoptosis is characterized by distinctive morphological and biochemical features. Typical signs of apoptosis are nucleolytic degradation of chromosomal DNA, compaction and fragmentation of chromatin, cellular shrinkage, cytoplasmic blebbing, and fragmentation. These changes ultimately result in the formation of apoptotic bodies (Wyllie et al., 1980; Duvall and Wyllie, 1986; Bowen, 1993) .",

For example, enhanced replication of dengue virus in macrophages in patients with heterotypic antibody may result in dengue hemorrhagic fever rather than the less severe disease, which develops in a naive host (Gollins and Porterfield, 1984) . Another wellestablished example is the hepatitis induced in mice during infection with the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Bang and Warwick, 1960; Piazza, 1969; Virelizier and Allison, 1976) . In fully susceptible strains of mice, such as BALB/c, MHV-3 infection produced a fulminant hepatitis, characterized by abnormalities of the hepatic microcirculation (Levy et al., 1983) . Strain A mice (A/J) are resistant to the development of disease even though MHV-3 replicates in their livers . The induction of a unique macrophage prothrombinase (fgl2 prothrombinase) in response to MHV-3 infection correlates with the severity of infection. This unregulated elaboration of fgl2 prothrombinase during infection appears to be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of the lethal hepatitis observed in susceptible strains of mice (Dindzans et al., 1986; Pope et al., 1995) .",

A/J and BALB/c macrophages, growing on Lab-Tek Chamber Slides were mock or MHV-3 infected. Nuclear TUNEL staining was performed at various time points post infection and visualized directly by fluorescence microscopy. Representative photomicrographs of the same fields obtained by phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy at 10 h p.i. are shown in Fig. 1 . Mock-infected A/J-or BALB/c-derived cells had the typical morphology of intact macrophages and contained few TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells (not shown). The majority of MHV-infected BALB/c macrophages underwent cell fusion forming large syncytia (Fig. 1D ). TUNEL-positive cells were observed in a small fraction of the macrophages, and these cells were not incorporated into syncytia (Fig. 1B) . Quite different results were observed when A/J macrophages were infected with MHV-3. There was no visible syncytia formation during the first 10 h p.i. (Fig. 1C) , and in fact syncytia formation was not observed in infected A/J macrophages during a 12-h period of observation. A large number of TUNEL positive cells were observed in MHV-infected A/J macrophages by 10 h p.i. (Fig. 1A) . There was only a slight increase in the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells at 12 h p.i. compared to assays performed at 10 h p.i. Cell counts at 12 h p.i. indicated that TUNEL-positive cells made up 55% of the total cell population (Table 1 ). Based on these data we conclude that MHV-3 induces apoptosis in both A/J and BALB/c macrophages and that TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were not incorporated into or form syncytia.",

However, in situ TUNEL assays demonstrated that MHV-3 a Cultures of macrophages from A/J and BALB/c mice were infected with MHV-3 at a MOI of 1 or mock-infected and at the times indicated, stained with propidium iodide and the anti-MHV nucleocapsid monoclonal antibody 1.16.1, and analyzed by flow cytometry as described under Materials and Methods. infection of cultures of A/J macrophages resulted in fivefold more apoptotic cells than infection of BALB/c-derived macrophages. The source of this discrepancy is likely due to the exclusion of syncytial giant cells from the flow cytometric analysis. Large giant cells cannot pass the aperture, and smaller giant cells and fragmented syncytia will be excluded by the gating parameters, which exclude particles that are not the correct size for intact cells. MHV-3 infection of BALB/c macrophages resulted in cell fusion and syncytial giant cell formation. These cells were excluded from the flow cytometric DNA content analysis. Thus this analysis only represents the single cell fraction. For A/J macrophages, almost no syncytia were formed, thus the DNA content analysis reflects events in virtually all of the macrophages in the culture. The in situ TUNEL assay is free of the bias against cells undergoing fusion in response to MHV infection. This method also revealed that only single cells that were not incorporated into syncytia in response to MHV-3 infection underwent apoptosis.",

This could commit infected BALB/c macrophages to high levels of S-protein expression, with resulting cell fusion prior to the cells acting on the apoptotic signal. In BALB/c macrophages, apoptosis is only slightly increased by infecting cells under conditions where syncytia formation does not occur (low cell density). Thus it appears that cell fusion by itself is not a major variable in preventing apoptosis in BALB/c macrophages. In this scenario, in BALB/c macrophages MHV-3 simply outruns the apoptotic response, in A/J macrophages the response is effective. This would serve to limit spread by cell\u00b1cell fusion of MHV-3 in cultures of A/J-derived macrophages and thus limit virus yields. Other possible explanations for the different outcomes of MHV-3 infection of BALB/c and A/J macrophages might be variations in the levels of bcl-2, TNF-\u2423 or other cytokines important in decreasing programmed cell death in infected cells. In this regard, it was recently shown that overexpression of bcl-2 can block or delay apoptosis induced by Sindbis virus (Levine et al., 1996) , La Crosse virus (Pekosz et al., 1996) , adenovirus (Chiou et al., 1994) , and influenza virus (Hinshaw et al., 1994) .",

            "text": "The induction of apoptosis during virus infection can be viewed as a nonspecific cellular defense mechanism to limit virus replication. Indeed, induction of apoptosis restricts replication and infectivity of baculovirus (Clem and Miller, 1993) . Although the extent of viral replication in A/J mice is considerable, the titer achieved is less and the kinetics are slower compared to BALB/c mice (Dindzans et al., 1986) , paralleling the results, which have been obtained in cultured macrophages (Macnaughton and Patterson, 1980; this work) . In addition to restricting viral yield (see Fig. 4 ) and slowing spread of the virus throughout the host, the induction of apoptosis in macrophages during MHV-3 infection may have an additional protective effect in this system. BALB/c macrophages elaborate the fgl2 prothrombinase in response to MHV-3 infection. This prothrombinase response has been shown to be an important determinant in the pathogenesis of the MHV-3-induced fulminant hepatitis that develops in this strain of mice (Li et al., 1992) . Macrophages from A/J mice do not elaborate detectable fgl2 prothrombinase in response to MHV-3 infection (Fig. 5) , although there is a slow (compared to that seen in BALB/c macrophages) induction of prothrombinase mRNA . In A/J macrophages, the possibility that the development of apoptosis in the majority of MHV-3infected cells prevents the expression of the fgl2 prothrombinase protein needs further investigation.",
