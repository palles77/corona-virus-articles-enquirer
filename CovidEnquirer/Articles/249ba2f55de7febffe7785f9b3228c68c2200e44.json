Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is one of the most promising viruses for engineering vaccines and oncolytic therapies [2] . Its genome is able to accept large foreign sequences ( Figure 1 ). VSV also remains viable as a pseudotyped virus (an enveloped virus expressing foreign glycoproteins in place of the native surface proteins) [3] . The broad tissue tropism allows for many different routes of administration, such as nasal sprays or intramuscular injection. VSV can be reliably grown to high titers in cell types approved for vaccine production. Finally, negligible pre-existing immunity to this vector exists in the general population.",

Of particular interest is a study in which VSV expressing the H5 antigen from highly pathogenic avian influenza induced sterilizing immunity against heterologous challenge in mice [4] . In this experiment, it was impossible to detect challenge virus in lungs 3 days post-challenge. One study vaccinated and challenged macaques immunocompromised by simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection [3] . The vaccine was well tolerated, and protected 67% of the vaccinated subjects from lethal Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) challenge. All unvaccinated animals succumbed by day 10 post-challenge. Only the most severely immunocompromised vaccinated subjects succumbed to ZEBOV challenge. This demonstrates the safety and efficacy potential of VSV when live virus vaccination would otherwise be contraindicated.",

Therefore, it is possible for VSV to kill tumor cells, leaving healthy tissue at tumor margins unharmed. VSV is highly immunogenic, therefore, it can be detected and neutralized by the immune system before tumors are sufficiently destroyed. Introducing the antiinflammatory glycoprotein from equine herpesvirus 1 into the VSV genome helped the virus to replicate more effectively in a rat model of hepatocellular carcinoma [7] . This resulted in a significant increase of the area of necrotic cells within the tumor. It also increased the survival of the animals.",

The genome is small enough to be manipulated in bacterial plasmids. Its structure is simple enough to be modeled using Computer Assisted Design software applications for synthetic biology. For instance, GenoCAD [11] was used to generate the logical representations of the therapeutic viruses reviewed in this letter (Figure 1 ). The coalescence of progress in synthetic biology Similarly, a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) vaccine was designed by replacing the VSV G protein with the SARS spike (S) protein (c). The avian influenza vaccine relies on the insertion of a sequence coding for the H5 antigen immediately next to the leader sequence (d). Interestingly, the booster vaccine carries a different variant of the VSV G protein to escape the anti-VSV immune response acquired during the primary immunization. The tuberculosis vaccine relies on the insertion of an antigen between G and L (e). The Yersinia pestis vaccine is structurally comparable to the avian influenza vaccine (f). Finally, the anti-inflammatory oncolytic VSV has a large insert between G and L. The insert includes an anti-inflammatory glycoprotein (EHV1G) and a reporter gene (Luc) separated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (g). These logical maps were generated using GenoCAD [11] .",

(peccoud@vt.edu). and VSV biology are likely to result in the development of a new generation of prophylactic and therapeutic viruses against a broad range of infectious and oncologic diseases. Logical representation of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) genome structure. The natural VSV genome (a) is composed of five open reading frames bounded by a 3 0 leader sequence (Le) and a 5 0 trailer region (Tr). Sequences coding for foreign antigens can be inserted in 3 0 of the nucleoprotein (N) gene and between the glycoprotein (G) and large polymerase protein (L) genes. These locations are indicated by broken lines in (a). The Ebola vaccine was designed by replacing the VSV G protein with the Ebola G protein, leading to a replicating pseudotyped vector (b).",
