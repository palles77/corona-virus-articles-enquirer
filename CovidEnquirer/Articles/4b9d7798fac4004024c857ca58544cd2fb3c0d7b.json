Our answer is that medicine cannot be practised in isolation. As the world becomes smaller, health care around the world has more, not less, in common. All health care systems struggle with the challenges of limited resources and growing demand. As well as providing clinically practical, we think the BMJ has a role in presenting an international perspective on health care [1].",

To appreciate the importance of international collaboration in the various specialties, it is imperative to recognize not only the similarities within health systems, but also to recognize the international focus of disease. From the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome episode, linked by mad cow disease and associated dietary change, and today's avian flu, pictures of masked agricultural workers and health care professionals from around the world destroying livestock and birds have become commonplace. Perhaps less well appreciated but crucially important to world health is the underlying interpersonal communication and data sharing between clinicians in all parts of the world to contain the disease and effect cures against the unknown. Physicians who dealt with severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong and Toronto were caught unaware and needed to define isolation procedures and barrier precautions that have been unprecedented in recent times; indeed, ICU morale becomes an issue when the care providers not only are in danger, but also become patients and add to mortality statistics.",

For those who have children, the question whether they will follow in their parents' footsteps is germane and a specific twist on Drucker's challenge. Today, although the subspecialty of CCM is proselytized medical professional organizations, the reality is that relatively few physicians are certified in this subspecialty worldwide. In the United States, recent attempts to increase exposure to CCM in residency training program have been met with concern because of the potential reduction in training time in operating room techniques. It is interesting to compare and contrast the role of anesthesiologists in the different international models of critical care delivery with the current situation in the United States.",

Each institution has to do its own work in the same manner that each instrument in an orchestra plays only its own part; but there is also the score, the community. If each individual instrument contributes to the score, then there is music. This is the ultimate job of the critical care specialist; it is more than being the conductor, it is creating the environment in which conducting is an understood and desirable component of the process.",

Unfortunately, this exposure is often fragmented and leads to tension between various institutional organizations; the emergency department, specialty-specific ICUs, and the allocation of step-down and other scarce patient care resources. The importance of the ICU paradigm is to recognize the pre-eminence of an integrated team approach to care that transcends professional boundaries and national and international borders.",

No longer is the model one of exclusion; rather, current practice is increasingly recognizing the importance of accountability and inclusion as the reality of patient outcome moves from cure to care. Resource use is an equally important facet of this model, but it incorporates the requirement for follow-up clinics with detailed outcome assessments that highlight quality of life after ICU discharge and the impact of successful care on patients and their families. The most cost-effective model of CCM is early cure and discharge; unfortunately, current technology may create an intermediate (gray zone) level of care in which anticipated outcome is poor and yet one in which the practitioner must continue to afford the most sophisticated care possible. Ultimately, patients declare their outcome, and one of the most difficult of all ICU tasks is the management of the patient, family, and staff in the transition from cure to care in the terminal stage of disease. This is an often neglected discussion in critical care, yet it is one that must be incorporated in all models and levels of care.",

The ICU became one of the earliest environments to incorporate outcome analysis to its therapeutic paradigms. Today's use of algorithms for mechanical ventilation, blood glucose control, and antibiotic administration is beginning to have a significant and positive impact on patient outcome. These changes do not come easily, however, and in many institutions the imperative on usual and customary care outweighs the importance of defining a culture of change founded on the principles of quality improvement activities. In today's critical care environment, change is not an option; it is a requirement for excellence. The WFSICCM supports a global initiative to redefine cost-effective, culturally sensitive, and domestically appropriate care paradigms that provide access for the greatest number of patients to the most sophisticated, effective, and locally obtainable care. In pursuing this goal, the WFSICCM is working with its national members to create a resource database that helps organizations petition local governments for resources comparable with regional standards.",

Additionally, further society goals include revision of the WFSICCM's humane and ethical principles and the formulation of regional educational resources to promote international accreditation standards in CCM. Concurrently, it is important to devise immediate interventions that, while proselytizing long-term improvement, effect immediate improvements on the care currently rendered. This may become routine with the introduction of simple team building exercises into the ICUs. The environments are complex and we cannot wait for the success and maturation of new medical school curricula to expand on the use of today's learning paradigms. Resident education in the United States is now expected not only to educate trainees in six core medical competencies but also to implement evaluation tools that provide appropriate feedback to the learner [6] . Three of the areas are easy to understand and follow familiar themes: (1) medical knowledge, (2) patient care, and (3) case-based learning. Today's practitioners can relate to these activities and define the manner in which they were taught and examined. More difficult to teach, and certainly more difficult to evaluate, however, are the remaining competencies of professionalism, interpersonal and communication skills, and systems-based practice. These are proving to be core skills that lie at the heart of future medical system change and concomitant improvements in patient care. With the successful implementation of the core competencies across all resident education programs and their acquisition by the trainees, it is likely that future physicians will be able to undertake the challenges associated with improving care delivery in complex and resource constrained environments successfully. Once the personal level of care has been addressed, it is more likely that the organizations that deliver care will be positively impacted. The value of the international organization is that, paradoxically, it is often more capable of representing the individual physician than the local medical staff or hospital organization. The critical care physician is often in the minority and advocates for changes that are foreign to much of organized medicine. Nowhere is the requirement for team patient care more readily apparent than in the ICU; it is natural that improvement efforts should be focused in this area. The challenge for today, however, is to help stimulate realistic change that not only enhances patient care but also seeds the environment for the introduction of behaviors to come. Perhaps the easiest intervention is to introduce the concept of a team huddle before initiating a procedure or embarking on specific patient care to reinvigorate the dedication of the unit's mission to individual care. It is important to expand the traditional nursing handoff reports into a team discussion about the patient and his or her circumstances. Physician ward rounds, nursing reports, nutritional assessments, pastoral care discussions, respiratory therapy intervention, and family interactions must be integrated to accommodate this goal. Initially, this is an intrusion into the daily routine, but rapidly it becomes a well-recognized and valued part of the ICU's culture. It allows all care providers to discuss individual concerns in a manner that is supportive and likely to lead to improved individual and team performance. Irrespective of the event, there is no team contest that begins without a player conference detailing the strategy of the day rather than relying on past performance or the chance of missed signals or strategies compromising the result. How can health care professionals participating in a team environment consider a less rigorous approach to patient care strategic planning?",

In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1966 imposes significant penalties for breach of confidentiality of health care information. Undoubtedly all understand the professional and societal dilemma of maintaining strict confidentiality of personal information that could have significant implications for a person's employability, insurability, and social acceptability versus the challenges associated with the information itself if its maintained confidentiality endangers the public good. Quarantine was seen as an effective mechanism to sequester diseased persons to minimize the spread of disease. Today, millions of birds have been destroyed to contain avian flu, but the disease is spreading along well known bird migratory routes. It is apparent that quarantine is unlikely to be a successful defense in the international community. If this is the case, then what personal information about travelers who have recently visited disease endemic regions should become publicly available and to who? It is possible that knowledge of disease transmission patterns could lead to earlier diagnosis and potential therapeutic solutions; however, to obtain this degree of specificity, it is likely that traditionally held beliefs of personal privacy would be compromised and the international response to such information requests is suspect at best. The value of international organizations in this situation becomes uniquely important, because networked databases that contain personal identifiers free, but nonetheless valuable demographic information, may be made available to physicians worldwide while the personal prerogatives of patients and their families becomes the debate of international legislative and diplomatic bodies. Patient care cannot wait; the international community must determine a rapidly responsive mechanism through which early disease identification, isolation, and treatment can be effected.",

It is only in those situations where the cost of error becomes readily apparent that reorganization occurs. The safe, high-performance environment is an improvement paradigm in business and military organizations but surprisingly not in medicine. Perhaps the traditional dominance of the physician, and perhaps most specifically the surgeon, has paralyzed medicine from taking appropriate steps to reorganize its culture to create a more patientresponsive environment. The critical care unit is unique in the institution because it usually receives the maximum resources in proportion to the institution's capacity and relies, varyingly, on a team approach to patient care. It is in this framework that the international organization must add value and help local practitioners improve patient outcome cost effectively. The WFSICCM's global goals are to prevent needless pain, suffering, and death. Site-appropriate excellent care must be accomplished rapidly and delivered with attention to local custom, national resources, and international requirements. No clinician practices in a local regional or national vacuum; all are members of a global community whose disease patterns transcend national borders. A practice must reach a level of professionalism that is defined by global compassion and international standards of excellence. The paradox of the challenge to accomplish these goals is best stated by Lao-tzu in the Tao te ching (4th century BC):",
