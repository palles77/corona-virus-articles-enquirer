Persons affected in foodborne outbreaks of cyclosporiasis in North America were mostly adults who experienced prolonged symptomatic gastroenteritis, and median food-specific attack rates were high (6, 7) . In this study, only healthy adult volunteers (22-53 years of age) were recruited from areas in which cyclosporiasis is not known to be endemic. Therefore, although the number of volunteers in this study was small (N = 7), epidemiologic data suggest that host susceptibility factors did not substantially contribute to inability of the inocula to cause infection in the volunteers at the doses administered.",

Nucleotide sequence variability in the first internal transcribed spacer regions within C. cayetanensis from different geographic origins has been observed and suggests the existence of multiple strains (8, 9) . In addition, data from Cryptosporidium human volunteer studies demonstrated that the 50% infectious dose (ID 50 ) differed (from 9 to 1,042 oocysts), depending on the isolate used in the study (10) . For these reasons, we attempted to vary the inocula by selecting oocysts from persons in different geographic regions (Haiti, Missouri, and Georgia) and increasing the numbers All oocysts in stool samples in this study were stored in potassium dichromate (2.5%), and most of the final inoculum preparations were disinfected with bleach (5.25%). Cryptosporidium parvum has been stored in 2.5% potassium dichromate (for <6 weeks to >12 weeks) and remained infectious in human volunteers, cell culture, and animals (11, 12) . Also, baboons inoculated with oocysts never exposed to potassium dichromate were not infected with Cyclospora (M. Eberhard, unpub. data). Other parasites of genera related to Cyclospora (Cryptosporidium, Eimeria spp., Toxoplasma gondii, sporocysts of Sarcocystis spp.) have been shown to resist high levels of bleach (13) (14) (15) . However, the effects of potassium dichromate and bleach on the Cyclospora oocysts used in this study are unknown, since methods to evaluate infectivity and viability were not available.",
