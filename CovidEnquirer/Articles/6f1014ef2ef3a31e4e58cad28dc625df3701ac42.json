Since those functions are associated with the hippocampus, I analyzed the global gene expression data from post-mortem hippocampal tissue of 25 old (age $ 60 yrs) and 15 young (age # 45 yrs) cognitively intact human subjects. By employing a rigorous, multi-method bioinformatic approach, I identified 36 genes that were the most significant in terms of differential expression; and by employing mathematical modeling, I demonstrated that 7 of the 36 genes were able to discriminate between the old and young subjects with high accuracy. Remarkably, 90% of the known genes from those 36 most significant genes are associated with either inflammation or immune system activation. This suggests that chronic inflammation and immune system over-activity may underlie the aging process of the human brain, and that potential anti-inflammatory treatments targeting those genes may slow down this process and alleviate its symptoms.",

Fig. 1b depicts the results of K-Means clustering analysis based on the expression of the top 36 most significant genes. All K-Means clustering analysis results (with respect to both the housekeeping genes and the 36 most significant genes) are shown in Supplementary Table 2 . As can be seen in both Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2 , there is a clear separation of the two groups. Fig. 2 depicts the heat map that resulted by plotting the expression of those 36 genes for all 40 subjects (15 young and 25 old). As can be seen by the relative intensities, all of the 36 most significant genes are over-expressed (red color) in the case of the old subjects as compared with the case of the young subjects (blue color). The direction of the differential expression of those 36 genes also appears in Table 1 . Moreover, Fig. 3 provides a 3D representation of the differential expression of those 36 genes between the two groups in a surface-contour plot. classify the 40 subjects with a high accuracy. Such a model would be valuable in future studies of global gene expression analysis of post-mortem hippocampal tissue investigating biological and chronological aging. To that end, I randomly selected approximately 70% of the subjects [11/15 young subjects and 18/25 old subjects] for the development of the function (henceforward referred to as super variable), and I used the remaining subjects (4 young and 7 old) solely for the purpose of validating the super variable. Employing a general methodology that I have previously introduced 6,7 , I was able to generate a super variable (function) that, based on the input of 7 genes from the 36 most significant genes, was able to identify/classify accurately all but one of the old subjects {subject # 33 [64 yrs (F)]} [sensitivity 5 (24/25) 5 0.96] and all of the young subjects [specificity 5 (15/15) 5 1.00]. Those overall results of the performance of the F 1 super variable were obtained by combining the results from the development and the validation phases. According to the rank that appears in Table 1 , the seven genes that provide the input to the F 1 super variable are: C4A (C4B), ADORA3, MS4A7, BCL6, CD44, C3AR1, and HLA-DRB1. All of those seven genes are, in terms of biological function, either genes of inflammation or genes of immune system activation. Supplementary Fig.  1 shows the F 1 super variable function in relation to its 7 input gene variables. Fig. 4 Table 3 show the overall results of the F 1 super variable, i.e. the F 1 scores of all 40 subjects used in this study, as well as their respective classification. Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3 were created by combining the results from the development phase (the F 1 scores of all 29 subjects that were randomly selected and used exclusively for the development of the model) with the results from the validation phase (the F 1 scores of all 11 subjects that were randomly selected and used exclusively for testing purposes). The results of the F 1 super variable in the development phase are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary  Table 4 , whereas the results in the validation phase are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 5 .",

The results of my study corroborate those observations. Looking at the expression of the 36 most significant hippocampal genes of all 40 subjects Table 2 ). Moreover, the aforementioned observations about the biovariability of the aging process were also supported by the results of hierarchical clustering analysis performed on the F 1 scores of all 40 subjects (Supplementary Fig. 4) . 15 young subjects (Y) with respect to the house-keeping genes (a), and with respect to the 36 most significant genes (b). In (a), in connection with the house-keeping genes, the two groups are inseparable and indistinguishable; whereas in (b), in connection with the 36 most significant genes, the two groups are separated and are clearly distinguishable.

This is further supported by the fact that the aforementioned seven genes employed by the F 1 super variable, all of which are genes of inflammation or genes of immune system activation, can discriminate between old and young brains with almost a perfect accuracy [sensitivity 5 (24/25) 5 0.96 and specificity 5 (15/15) 5 1.00].",

BCL6 has been observed to be over-expressed in patients with Huntington disease 13 , with ischemic stroke 14 , with rheumatoid arthritis 15 , with B-cell lymphoma 16 , etc. CD44 has been found to be over-expressed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus 17 , with immune thrombocytopenia 18 , with schwannomas 19 , with Huntington disease 8 , and numerous other diseases and conditions. Over-expression of C3AR1 has been observed in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome 20 , with asthma 21 , etc., while overexpression of HLA-DRB1 has been observed in patients with multiple sclerosis 22 , with rheumatoid arthritis 23 , with Duchenne muscular dystrophy 24 , etc. Previous studies using animal models have observed associations between aging and inflammation in connection with the hippocampus, the neocortex, and the cerebellum 25,26 . Using animal models or human subjects with early-stage neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer, other studies have observed a link between neuroinflammation and deficits in synaptic plasticity, especially long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, which is associated with longterm memory consolidation [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] 2 . The fact that definitive causality cannot be established here notwithstanding -in other words, whether it is the normal aging process that induces inflammation/ immune-system-overactivity, or whether the vice versa occurs, or whether another, hitherto unspecified, process engenders the normal aging process, which in turn induces inflammation/immune-systemoveractivity, or whether that unspecified process engenders inflammation/immune-system-overactivity, which in turn induces the normal aging process -the results of my study support a direct causal link between the normal aging process and the process of inflammation/immune-system-overactivity. When considered collectively, therefore, the results of my study and all of the above observations from the other aforementioned studies point to a plausible theory on the normal aging process. At some point in time, chronic, low-level inflammation establishes itself and elicits a corresponding chronic immune response and activity. These two conjugate processes ultimately are responsible for a gradual loss of synaptic plasticity, particularly LTP in the hippocampus, accompanied with a minimal neuronal loss 33, 34, [1] [2] [3] . It is this loss of synaptic plasticity -at least in the hippocampus part of the brain -that is associated with the phenotypical changes of normal aging.",

The magnitude of the neuroinflammatory processes in the case of Alzheimer disease or other neurodegenerative diseases, however, cannot be compared to that of the neuroinflammation in the normal aging process; and by virtue of the same argument, the task of . The F 1 uses 7 of the 36 most significant genes as its input variables. Using the expression value of those 7 genes for a particular subject, the F 1 yields the F 1 score of that subject; and, based on the determined cut-off score of 53.450, the F 1 classifies that subject as young if the F 1 score is , 53.450 or as old if the F 1 score is $ 53.450. As can be seen by the overall performance, the F 1 classified correctly all subjects except one old one [sensitivity 5 (24/25) 5 0.96 and specificity 5 (15/15) 5 1.00]. The mean F 1 score of the Y subjects was 45.028 (top of the blue bar) and their standard deviation (whiskers above or below the top of the blue bar) was 4.721. The mean F 1 score of the O subjects was 64.212 (top of the red bar) and their standard deviation (whiskers above or below the top of the red bar) was 6.514.

The F 1 is parametrically distributed with respect to both groups.

It would stand to reason, therefore, that anti-inflammatory treatment strategies may be more successful and efficacious than those employed against the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, I should point out that, based on increased evidence over the last twenty years or so, neuroinflammation seems to be the common denominator of normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer. Understanding the causal circumstances under which a chronic, low-level neuroinflammatory process can transition to a major neuroinflammation conducive to neuronal degeneration and death would be of paramount importance. According to the latest evidence 37 , even a single substitution mutation on a single inflammation gene might suffice to trigger that transition in a small percentage of the population.",

Taking into account that there are 54,675 probe sets (including those of the housekeeping genes) in the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chip, and using the Bonferroni correction, I set the significance level for the entire study at a 5 9.15 3 10 27 . Therefore, in order for any variable to be deemed significant according to the P-value method, the following condition must be met: P , a. Regarding the Mann-Whitney U test (MW), since none of the non-parametric variables had any sets of ties (a subject from one group having the same expression value as a subject from the other group), I used the exact probability for all MW tests.",

Utilizing the final 36 most significant genes, I wanted to explore the possibility of developing -via mathematical modeling -a function that could identify as correctly as possible the age status (O or Y) of an unknown subject based on the expression of any combination of those 36 most significant genes. To that end, I randomly selected approximately 70% of the subjects [11/15 young subjects and 18/25 old subjects] that could be used only for the development phase of such function. In other words, a function could be developed only by the exclusive use of those 29 subjects. The remaining 11 subjects (4 young and 7 old ones) were designated unknown (test) subjects and were used solely for the purpose of validating any promising function generated in the development phase. This split into two fixed sets, whereby one is used only for training and the other only for validation, represents the simplest implementation of K-fold cross validation 45, 46 . A function was deemed promising in the development phase only if it exhibited a sensitivity $ 0.90 and a specificity $ 0.90 in connection with the 29 subjects of the development phase. Pertaining to the validation phase, and in connection with the 11 unknown subjects, a promising function would have to exhibit the same minimum classification accuracy (a sensitivity $ 0.90 and a specificity $ 0.90) in order to be accepted. I was able to generate one such function (F 1 -henceforward also referred to as super variable) that fulfilled all of the aforementioned criteria. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows the equation of F 1 as a function of 7 genes.",

The 99.99% confidence intervals were calculated based on a bootstrap sample size of 100,000. Taking into account the aforementioned ROC optimal point, as well as the relative overlap of MO and MY [MO 5 LLO -SDO and MY 5 ULY 1 SDY] (LLO: the 99.99% confidence lower limit for the mean of the O group; SDO: standard deviation of the O group; ULY: the 99.99% confidence upper limit for the mean of the Y group; SDY: standard deviation of the Y group), the cut-off score of the F 1 super variable was determined to be 53.450.

The results according to those three different and independent methods, and prior to the final selection, are shown in Supplementary",
