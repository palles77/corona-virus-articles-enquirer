            "text": "The impact on the host of microbial damage depends very much on the tissue involved. Damage to muscle in the shoulder or stomach wall, for instance, may not be serious, but in the heart the very existence of the host depends on a strong muscle contraction continuing to occur every second or so, and here the effect of minor functional changes may be catastrophic. The central nervous system is particularly vulnerable to slight damage. The passage of nerve impulses requires normal function in the neuronal cell membrane, and viruses especially have important effects on cell membranes. Also a degree of cellular or tissue oedema that is tolerable in most tissues may have serious consequences if it occurs in the brain, enclosed in that more or less rigid box, the skull. Therefore, encephalitis and meningitis tend to cause more severe illness than might be expected from the histological changes themselves. Oedema is a serious matter also in the lung. Oedema fluid or inflammatory cell exudates appear first in the space between the alveolar capillary and the alveolar wall, decreasing the efficiency of gaseous exchanges. Respiratory function is more drastically impaired when fluid or cells accumulate in the alveolar air space.* The effect of tissue damage is much less in the case of organs such as the liver, pancreas or kidney, which have considerable functional reserves. More than two-thirds of the liver must be removed before there are signs of liver dysfunction. Cell damage has profound effects if it is the endothelial cells of small blood vessels that are involved. The resulting circulatory changes may lead to anoxia or necrosis in the tissues supplied by these vessels. Here too, the site of vascular lesions may be critical, effects on organs such as the brain or heart having a greater impact on the host, as discussed above. Rickettsiae characteristically grow in vascular endothelium, and this is an important mechanism of disease production. By a combination of direct and immunopathological factors there is endothelial swelling, thrombosis, infarcts, haemorrhage and tissue anoxia. This is especially notable in the skin, and forms the basis for the striking rashes in typhus and the spotted fevers. These skin rashes, although important for the physician are less important for the patient than similar lesions in the central nervous system or heart. It is damage to cerebral vessels that accounts for the cerebral disturbances in typhus; involvement of pulmonary vessels causes pneumonitis, and involvement of myocardial vessels causes myocardial oedema. In Q fever, rickettsiae sometimes localise in the endocardium, and this causes serious complications.",

The signs of liver dysfunction are an accepted result of infections of the liver, just as paralysis or coma is an accepted result of infection of the central nervous system. Diabetes may turn out to be caused by infection of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Coxsackie and other virus infections of the islets of Langerhans can certainly cause diabetes in experimental animals, and coxsackieviruses have been associated with juvenile diabetes in man.",

            "text": "There are many diseases of unknown aetiology for which an infectious origin has been suggested. Sometimes it is fairly well established that an infectious agent can at least be one of the causes of the disease, but in most instances it is no more than a hypothesis, with little or no good evidence. For conditions as common and as serious as multiple sclerosis, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis it would be of immense importance if a microorganism were incriminated, since this would give the opportunity to prevent the disease by vaccination. Accordingly, there is a temptation to accept or publicise new reports even though the evidence is weak or the observations poorly controlled. As if to warn us about this and remind us of possibilities from environmental toxins, Parkinson's disease, a chronic neurological condition in which there is a loss of neurons in a sharply defined region of the brain (substantia nigra), can be caused by exposure to the chemical MPTP. One example which raises the possibility that subtle CNS disturbances may be caused by viruses is experimental infection with Borna disease virus. This virus was used to infect tree shrews (Tupaia glis) which are primitive primates. There is little overt disease, but afterwards the male is no longer able to enact the ritual courtship behaviour which (as students well know), is an essential preliminary to mating in all primates, and the frustrated male usually ends up bitten by the female. Thus it can be said that infection with Borna disease virus renders the male psychologically sterile. Presumably the virus in some way alters the functioning of neurons concerned in this particular pathway. All other behavioural and physiological aspects appear normal. Borna disease virus is not known to occur in man, but speculation about an analogous human situation is fuelled by the finding of Borna disease virus-specific antibodies in patients with psychiatric/ behavioural disorders. In an entirely different clinical context, infection of a particular strain of rats with Borna disease virus causes immense obesity, the underlying physiological basis of which is not understood. Since the aetiology of such diseases raises interesting problems in pathogenesis, the present state of affairs is summarised in Table 8 .1, which includes some of the human diseases whose infectious origin is probable, possible, conceivable, or inconceivable.",

            "text": "Causal connections between infection and disease states are particularly difficult to establish when the disease appears a long time after infection. It was not too difficult to prove and accept that the encephalitis that occasionally occurs during or immediately after measles was due to measles virus. But it was hard to accept that a very rare type of encephalitis (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis or SSPE), occurring up to 10 years after apparently complete recovery from measles, was also due to measles virus and this was only established after careful studies and the eventual difficult isolation of a mutant form of measles virus from brain cells. 'Slow' infections, in which the first signs of disease appear a long time after infection are now an accepted part of our outlook. The disease kuru occurred in New Guinea and was transmitted from person to person by cannibalism. The incubation period of the disease in man appears to be 12-15 years, and was caused by a nonisolatable infectious agent that grew in the brain. This was established when the same disease appeared in monkeys several years after the injection of material from the brain of Kuru patients. A similar agent called scrapie (see Ch. 7) infects sheep, mice and other animals and also has an incubation period representing a large portion of the life span of the host. In both Kuru and SSPE the agent was eventually shown to be present in the brains of patients. So far this has only been demonstrated indirectly as, despite strenuous efforts, the causative agent has yet to be isolated. If in a slow infection the microorganism that initiated the pathological process is no longer present by the time the disease becomes manifest, then the problem of establishing a causal relationship will be much greater. This may possibly turn out to be true for diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Liver cancer in humans and leukaemia in mice, cats, humans and cattle can be caused by slow type virus infections. Cancer or leukaemia appears as a late and occasional sequel to infection. The virus, its antigens or fragments of its nucleic acid are detectable in malignant cells.",

Clearly a microorganism with a doubling time of a day or two will tend to cause a more slowly evolving infection and disease than one that doubles in an hour or less. It is uncommon for an infectious agent to cause exactly the same disease in all those infected. Its nature and severity will depend on infecting dose and route, and on the host's age, sex, nutritional status, genetic background, and so on. Many infections are asymptomatic in more than 90% of individuals, clinically characterised disease occurring in only an occasional unfortunate host, as 'the tip of the iceberg'.* Asymptomatically infected individuals are important because they are not identified, move normally in the community, and play an important part in transmission.",

But one of the earliest indications of illness is malaise, 'not feeling very well'. This is distinct from fever or a specific complaint such as a sore throat and although it is difficult to define and impossible to measure, we all know the feeling. It can precede the onset of more specific signs and symptoms, or accompany them. Sometimes it is the only indication that an infection is taking place. Almost nothing is known of the basis for this feeling. Toxins', of course, have been invoked and the earliest response to pyrogens (see pp. 298-300) before body temperature has actually risen, may play a part. Interferons may have something to do with it because pure preparations of human a or \u00df Interferons cause malaise and often headaches and muscle aches after injection into normal individuals. If interferon is eventually recognised as an important antimicrobial force we may have to regard these side effects as unfortunate but acceptable. Soluble mediators of immune and inflammatory responses, such as interleukin-1 (see Glossary) or other cytokines may also play a part. In some infectious diseases weakness and debility are prominent during convalescence. This can be especially notable following influenza and hepatitis, but its basis is as mysterious as in the case of malaise.",

            "text": "The infections that matter are those causing pathological changes and disease. Before giving an account of the mechanisms by which these changes are produced, it is important to remember that many infectious agents cause little or no damage in the host. Indeed, it is of some advantage to the microorganism to cause minimal host damage, as discussed in Ch. 1. Virus infections as often as not fall into this category. Thus, although infection with rabies or measles viruses nearly always causes disease, there are many enterovirus, reovirus and myxovirus infections that are regularly asymptomatic. Even viruses that are named for their association with disease (poliomyelitis, influenza, Japanese B encephalitis) often give an antibody response as the only sign of infection in the host. Tissue damage is too slight to cause detectable illness. There is also a tendency for persistent viruses to cause no more than minor or delayed cellular damage during their persistence in the body, even if the same virus has a more cytopathic effect during an acute infection, e.g. adenoviruses, herpes simplex (see Ch. 10). A few viruses are remarkable because they cause no pathological changes at all in the cell, even during a productive infection in which infectious virus particles are produced. For instance, mouse cells infected with LCM or leukaemia virus show no pathological changes. A mouse congenially infected with LCM virus shows a high degree of immune tolerance, and all tissues in the body are infected. Throughout the life of the animal, virus and viral antigens are produced in the cerebellum, liver, retina etc. without discernible effect on cell function. But sometimes there are important functional changes in infected cells which lead to a pathological result. For example, the virus infects growth hormoneproducing cells in the anterior pituitary. Although the cells appear perfectly healthy, the output of growth hormone is reduced, and as a result of this, suckling mice fail to gain weight normally and are runted.",

            "text": "When bacteria invade tissues, they almost inevitably cause some damage, and this is also true for fungi and protozoa. The extent of direct damage, however, is sometimes slight. This is true for Treponema pallidum, perhaps because the lipopolysaccharide-protein components that might have induced inflammatory responses, are not exposed on the surface of the bacteria. It produces no toxins, does not cause fever, and attaches to cells in vitro without harmful effects. Leprosy and tubercle bacilli eventually damage and kill the macrophages in which they replicate, but pathological changes are to a large extent caused by indirect mechanisms (see below). In patients with untreated lepromatous leprosy, the bacteria in the skin invade blood vessels, and large numbers of bacteria, many of them free, may be found in the blood. In spite of the continued presence of up to 10 5 bacteria m l -1 of blood there are no signs or symptoms of septicaemia or toxaemia. Mycobacterium leprae can be regarded as a very successful parasite that induces very little host response in these patients, even when the bloodstream is invaded. The resident bacteria inhabiting the skin and intestines of man and animals do not invade tissues and are normally harmless; indeed, as discussed in Ch. 1, they may benefit the host. Bacteria such as meningococci and pneumococci, whose names imply pathogenicity, spend most of their time as harmless inhabitants of the normal human nasopharynx: only occasionally do they have the opportunity to invade tissues and give rise to meningitis or pneumonia.",

Many virus infections result in a shutdown of RNA synthesis (transcription), protein synthesis (translation) and DNA synthesis in the host cell, but usually these are too slow to account for the death of the cell. After all, cells like neurons never synthesise DNA, and the half life of most proteins and even RNAs is at least several hours. A possible alternative mechanism is the alteration of the differential permeability of the plasma membrane. This is important as the cell has a high internal K + concentration and low N a + concentration, while the reverse is true of body fluids. Viruses do alter membrane permeability, but the unresolved question is whether or not this is responsible for the death of the cell or is merely an after-effect.",

This is the natural process by which the body controls cell numbers and rids itself of superfluous or redundant cells during development. A familiar example is a tadpole 'losing' its tail. Cells do not disintegrate but round up, and are then removed by phagocytes. A possible example of apoptosis is seen in the common cold when caused by the rhino virus group of picorna viruses. Rhinoviruses infect nasal epithelial cells, and at an early stage the cells round up, fall off the mucosal surface and are carried away, often with their cilia still beating, in a stream of fluid induced by the infection.* This leaves areas of raw mucosa, with the exposed underlying tissues inflamed, oedematous, and susceptible to infection by the normally harmless resident bacteria.",

The most common and potentially reversible change, the oedema seen as 'cloudy swelling' by routine histology, is associated with membrane permeability changes. Changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and polyribosomes are seen by electron microscopy at this stage. Later the nuclear chromatin moves to the edge of the nucleus ('margination' of chromatin) and becomes condensed (pycnosis), but the cell has already died by this time. There are two more characteristic types of morphological change produced by certain viruses, and these were recognised by histologists more than 50 years ago. The first are inclusion bodies, parts of the cell with altered staining behaviour which develop during infection. They often represent either cell organelles or virus factories in which viral proteins and/or nucleic acids are being synthesised and assembled. Herpes group viruses form intranuclear inclusions, rabies and poxviruses intracytoplasmic inclusions, and measles virus both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The second characteristic morphological change caused by viruses is the formation of multinucleate giant cells. This occurs, for instance when HIV 'fusion' proteins (gpl20-gp41) present in nascent virus particles budding from an infected cell attach to CD4 receptors in the plasma membranes of neighbouring cells; membranes then fuse and multinucleate cells are formed. It also happens in measles and certain herpes virus infections.",

Here the direct damage is of such a magnitude that the susceptible host dies a mere six hours after infection. If Rift Valley Fever virus, an arthropod-borne virus infecting cattle, sheep and man in Africa, is injected in very large doses intravenously into mice, the injected virus passes straight through the Kupffer cells and endothelial cells lining liver sinusoids (see Ch. 5) and infects nearly all hepatic cells. Hepatic cells show nuclear inclusions within an hour, and necrosis by four hours. As the single cycle of growth in hepatic cells is completed, massive liver necrosis takes place, and mice die only six hours after initial infection. The host defences in the form of local lymph nodes, local tissue phagocytes etc. are completely overcome by the intravenous route of injection, and by the inability of Kupffer cells to prevent infection of hepatic cells. Direct damage by the replicating virus destroys hepatic cells long before immune or interferon responses have an opportunity to control the infection. This is the summit of virulence. The experimental situation is artificial but it illustrates direct and lethal damage to host tissues after all host defence mechanisms have been overwhelmed.",

This action, however, is confined to the infected cell, and toxic microbial products are not liberated to damage other cells. Mycoplasma (see Table A .2) can grow in special cell-free media, but in the infected individual they generally multiply while attached to the surface of host cells. As studied in culture and on the respiratory epithelium they 'burrow' down between cells, inhibit the beat of cilia and cause cell necrosis and detachment. The mechanism is not clear. If a complete lawn of mycoplasma covers the surface of the host cell, some effect on the health of the cell is to be expected, but it is possible that toxic materials are produced or are present on the surface of the mycoplasma.",

Colonisation of the tooth surface by Streptococcus mutans leads to plaque formation, and the bacteria held in the plaque utilise dietary sugar and produce acid (see p. 35). Locally produced acid decalcifies the tooth to give caries. Caries, arguably the commonest infectious disease of Western man, might logically be controlled by removing plaque, withholding dietary sugar, or vaccinating against Streptococcus mutans. However, fluoride in the water supply or in toothpaste has been the method of choice, and has been very successful. It acts by making teeth more resistant to acid. Bacteria generally damage the cells in which they replicate, and these are mostly phagocytic cells (see Ch. 4). Listeria, Brucella and Mycobacteria are specialists at intracellular growth, and the infected phagocyte is slowly destroyed as increasing numbers of bacteria are produced in it. Bacteria such as staphylococci and streptococci grow primarily in extracellular fluids, but they are ingested by phagocytic cells, and virulent strains of bacteria in particular have the ability to destroy the phagocyte in which they find themselves, even growing in the phagocytes, as described in Ch. 4. Many bacteria cause extensive tissue damage by the liberation of toxins into extracellular fluids. Various toxins have been identified and characterised.

This view is too embracing, because it includes proteins of doubtful significance in disease, and also too restrictive, because it excludes nonprotein toxic complexes such as endotoxin. Another suggestion is that toxin must include all naturally occurring substances (of plant, animal, bacterial or whatever origin) which when introduced into a foreign host are adverse to the well-being or life of the victim. This, too, is unsatisfactory because some substances-potent toxins within the scope of this definition-are being used in some contexts as therapeutic agents!

For decades, attempts have been made to make immunotoxins by coupling native toxins to antibodies specific to some surface antigen on tumour cells, with little practical success, as yet. However, scientists have now genetically engineered DT by substituting that portion of the DT structural gene encoding the native toxin receptor-binding domain with modified cDNA encoding one of a variety of cytokines and growth factors including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, EGF and \u03b1-MSH. The resultant fusion toxin bears a new 'cellular address', but retains all of the other biological properties of the native DT molecule as well as a three-dimensional structure nearly identical with native DT. The IL-2 receptor-binding domain fusion toxin has undergone Phase I/II clinical trials for the treatment of IL-2 receptor positive haematological malignancies (and other IL-2 related conditions) and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated. Such constructs are potent against a murine model of IL-2 receptor positive lymphoma, and the hope is that a durable remission of disease will be achieved in humans. (An era of new 'magic bullets'?) P. aeruginosa exotoxin A. P. aeruginosa, already alluded to above, is common in soil and water and can occasionally be isolated from the faeces of normal, healthy individuals. It is virtually harmless for healthy adults, but its ability to multiply in almost any moist environment and its resistance to many antibiotics have made the bacterium a major cause of * The KDEL motif is normally found in proteins which having been processed in the Golgi are trapped by the endoplasmic reticulum which recognises the KDEL motif. This prevents the protein being lost to the cell via exocytotic trafficking and results in its translocation into the cytoplasm. The schema shows a round of peptide elongation and illustrates the key role played by two enzymes, EF1 and EF2. DTA and PEA each ADP-ribosylates diphthamide (a modified histidine) in EF2-GTP which can no longer translocate the newly elongated peptide from the A site to the P site. ShT A fragment is a specific N-glycosidase which cleaves an adenine residue from near the 3'-prime end of the 28S ribosomal RNA. This depurination results in failure of EF1-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to site A and hence inhibits protein synthesis. Poliovirus achieves selective inhibition of host protein synthesis at an earlier stage than is depicted here. Host mRNA is first modified (capped) then bound to the small ribosomal subunit; poliovirus mRNA is not capped. The function of a cap-binding protein, which recognises and binds host mRNA to the ribosome, is inhibited by a poliovirus virion protein thereby allowing differential translation of virus messenger RNA.

P. aeruginosa causes localised infection in the urinary tract, respiratory tract, burns and wound infections. In severely debilitated patients these localised infections may develop into general septicaemia, with mortality in such cases approaching 100%. The mechanisms of pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa are complicated and unclear because (unlike C. diphtheriae) the organism elaborates several potentially toxic extracellular products, including a phospholipase, several proteases, lipase, haemolysin, enterotoxin, lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, elastase, exoenzyme S (PES), and exotoxin A (PEA); evidence definitely implicates the last three. Elastase has already been mentioned above (p. 207). PES is without question a virulence determinant, but at present its biological mode of action is not wholly understood. PEA is in many ways like DT. It inhibits protein synthesis by cleavage of NAD + and subsequent ADP-ribosylation of EF2 at the same diphthamide residue, is synthesised predominantly during the decline phase of cell growth, and its production appears to be dependent upon the concentration of iron in the medium. Its M r is 66 580, and it can be activated in cell-free systems by proteolysis, or by reduction with thiols in the presence of urea and other chaotropic agents. All the enzymic activity of the toxin resides in a proteolytically derived fragment (M r approximately 26000). However, dissimilarities exist between the two toxins. Firstly, the active A fragment resides in the COOH-terminal portion of the molecule, whereas the diphtheria A fragment is at the NH 2 -terminal end. Secondly, the B fragment of PEA recognises a different receptor to that of DT, and there are no sequence homologies or serological crossreactivity between the two toxins.",

Certain biotypes of E. coli make Vero toxins (VTs) or Shiga-like toxins (SLTs) which are identical (SLT1) or near identical (SLT2) with Shiga toxin. The role of Shiga toxin in bacillary dysentery is discussed below. SLT-producing strains of E. coli are responsible for haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic urea syndrome. Very recent crystallographic studies have shown a remarkable similarity in organisational structure of the B subunits of Shiga toxin and those of the cholera toxin family discussed below, despite the near complete absence of sequence homology. The B subunits attach to a ganglioside structure Gb3 or Gb4 (cholera toxin attaches to GM1) on susceptible cell surfaces. ShT-A fragment is a specific N-glycosidase which cleaves an adenine residue from near the 3'-prime end of 28S ribosomal RNA.

C. botulinum C2 toxin component 211 binds to the cell membrane followed by C2I. The latter is internalised and upsets the equilibrium between polymerisation and depolymerisation of actin. ADP-ribosylation of actin inhibits its polymerisation and turns G-actin into a capping protein which binds to the fast growing (concave) ends of actin filaments. Capping of the concave ends increases the critical concentration for actin polymerisation. Since the slow-growing (pointed) ends of actin filaments are free, depolymerisation of actin occurs at these ends. Released actin is substrate for the toxin and will be withdrawn from the treadmilling pool of actin by ADPribosylation, i.e. trapped. Both reactions will finally induce the breakdown of the microfilament network. (Taken with permission of authors (K. Aktorieseia/.) and publisher (Springer-Verlag GmbH & Co.

Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin is not a neurotoxin but belongs to a family of cytotoxins {Clostridium perfringens iota toxin, Clostridium spiroforme toxin, Clostridium difficile ADP ribosyltransferase) whose common features are that they are binary toxins and that they target cytoskeletal actin. Of these C. botulinum C2 is the best studied at present. Component C2I is the equivalent of the A subunit and C2II, the B subunit. They are produced in parallel although different strains produce different ratios. More C2 is produced during sporulation than in the vegetative phase of growth. C2II is activated by proteolysis to produce a 74 000 M r protein which binds to cell surfaces and thereby exposes a binding site for C2I (M r ca. 45 000) either on the cell surface or on attached C2II. Once inside, C2I ADP-ribosylates monomeric actin and not polymerised F actin. The substrate specificity is high. The toxin will modify a specific arginine residue present in certain isoforms of actin. Neither subunit is toxic on its own, but together the LD 50 dose for a mouse is ca. 5-50 ng. (Other examples of such 'binary' activity include anthrax toxin and staphylococcal leucocidin). The two components may be injected into different sites or by different routes but toxic effects always occur at the site of injection of C2II.",

Cyclic AMP is an important second messenger invoked in the intracellular amplification of many cellular responses to external signals including hormones. The nature of the physiological response reflects the biochemical differentiation of the cell responding to the stimulus. For example, in gut cells the response would be altered ion transport and hence fluid secretion; in muscle cells it would be glycogen breakdown in response to the call for more energy. The production of cAMP is controlled both positively and negatively at two different levels. The central cycle represents a normal membranebound hormone receptor and the heterotrimeric (a\u00df7) G protein regulator complex which is activated upon binding of hormone to the receptor. There are two receptors, each with regulatory G proteins: one system responds to stimulatory and the other responds to inhibitory stimuli; only one system is shown. In gut cells these receptors would be on the basolateral (nonluminal) side of enterocytes enabling responses to stimuli from the circulation. (b) The second level of control involves endogenous GTPase properties of both stimulatory (a s ) and the inhibitory (a A ) subunits of the G protein regulator which may be outlined as follows. Stimulation: agonist stimulation of its receptor results in the dissociation of the a s \u00df7 G protein from the receptor and of the subunits from each other, and the binding of GTP to a s . a s -GTP will productively interact with the catalytic unit of adenyl cyclase (not shown) and stimulate the production of cAMP from ATP. Endogenous GTPase activity in a s results in a delayed conversion of a s -GTP to inactive a s -GDP which can no longer stimulate the cyclase but allows the reassociation of the trimeric G protein and loss of GDP. Inhibition: antagonist stimulation of its receptor results in an analogous situation for inhibiting cyclase activity via c^: inhibitory cti-GTP inactivates the cyclase; cti-GDP does not inactivate the cyclase.",

Infection takes place following the ingestion of spores, the inhalation of spores, or by the entry of spores through abraded skin. The spores germinate and then the bacteria form a toxin that increases vascular permeability and gives rise to local oedema and haemorrhage. Infection of the skin in man leads to the formation of a lesion (malignant pustule; a black eschar, hence B. anthracis; Gr. anthrakos = coal) consisting of a necrotic centre surrounded by vesicles, blood-stained fluid and a zone of oedema and induration. In severe infections there is septicaemia with toxic signs, loss of fluid into tissues, with widespread oedema and eventually death. Anthrax toxin, the discovery of which by Smith and Keppie in the early 1950s was a major milestone in our subject, consists of three components, none of which are toxic by themselves: factor I (oedema factor or EF), factor II (protective antigen or PA) and factor III (lethal factor or LF). The toxin is largely responsible for local lesions, kills phagocytes, enters the circulation and accounts for the toxicity, oedema and death caused by B. anthracis. Virulent strains also have a capsular polypeptide composed of D-glutamic acid, which inhibits opsonisation and phagocytosis (see Ch. 4). Anthrax in man occurs mainly in those whose work brings them into contact with infected animals. It is not a common disease in the UK, and the usual source of infection is imported bones, hides, skins, bristles, wool and hair, or imported fertilisers made from the blood and bones of infected animals. Most of what has just been described was discovered more than three decades ago but more recently new insights have been obtained as to the biochemical basis of the mode of action of anthrax toxin.",

However combinations of PA and EF (but not PA and LF) caused an elevation of cAMP. Thus anthrax toxin (at least the PA/EF combination) is a binary toxin. The response observed is more rapid and greater than that induced by cholera toxin. In contrast to cholera toxin, the anthrax complex is the cyclase, acts without a lag phase and its effects are instantly reversible upon washing toxin-treated cells. This suggests that the enzyme is either rapidly degraded after internalisation, or that it is not completely internalised but WsfhiW II cAMP ATP Fig. 8 .7 Mode of action of anthrax toxin. Factor II (PA) interacts with the cell membrane. After proteolytic cleavage sites are exposed which bind factor I (EF) and facilitate internalisation of factor I (EF). This internalisation takes place via an endocytic step, with factor I being released into the cytosol. Factor I must be rapidly inactivated since washing toxin-treated cells results in a rapid loss of adenylate cyclase activity. Factor I interacts with calmodulin (CAL) to become an active adenylate cyclase enzyme. Interaction of factor I with factor II and subsequent internalisation is blocked by prior binding of factor III (LF) to factor II. associated with the cell membrane in a manner allowing it to be readily removed. These facts together with the observations that LF would block the activity of EF are summarised in Fig. 8 .7. This explains how LF blocks the effect of EF. They either compete for the same sites on PA, in which case the explanation is self-evident, or they bind to separate sites on PA which are situated such that occupancy of one occludes access to the other.",

Antibodies to PA could either block the initial attachment to the cell membrane of target organs in vivo, or prevent the binding of EF to PA, or both. The fact that cAMP is known to be a potent secretagogue could explain how the oedematous reaction occurs when PA and EF are injected into test animals, i.e. EF is, after activation, an oedema factor. Moreover, in biological tests, addition of LF (factor III) depresses oedema production as would be predicted by this model. The observation that PA was probably fixed first may now be placed on a firmer basis since binding of PA is a prerequisite for the expression of EF (and by implication) LF activities. The case for the view that, in experimental anthrax in guinea-pigs, animals died (as do humans) of secondary shock, is also placed on a firmer basis with perhaps one important reservation. Smith and coworkers claimed that factor III (LF) decreased oedema but increased lethality; the former but not the latter observation is explicable by the model which is therefore too simplistic to explain the effects of the holotoxin. It is likely that LF exerts its activity together with PA on other cells in vivo. It has in fact been shown that LF in combination with PA is cytolytic for macrophages and macrophage-like cell lines-the probable basis of the earlier observation that anthrax toxin kills phagocytes and perhaps justification for talking about a plurality of anthrax binary toxins.",

All strains of Clostridium tetani produce the same toxin. It also reaches the central nervous system by travelling up other peripheral nerves following bloodborne dissemination of the toxin through the body. The motor nerves in the brain stem are short and therefore the cranial nerves are among the first to be affected, causing spasms of eye muscles and jaw (lockjaw).

C. botulinum contaminates food, particularly inadequately preserved meat or vegetables, and produces a powerful neurotoxin.

It is strictly anaerobic and occurs as a normal inhabitant in the large intestines of man and animals; its spores are ubiquitous in soil, dust and air. C. perfringens does not multiply in healthy tissues, but grows rapidly when it reaches devitalised and therefore anaerobic tissues. This could be after contamination of a natural wound with soil or dust, particularly on battlefields or in automobile accidents, or after contamination of a surgical operation site with clostridia from the patient's own bowels or skin. After abortions, particularly in the old days before antibiotics, intestinal clostridia often gained access to necrotic or devitalised tissues in the uterus and set up life-threatening infections. Invasion of the blood was common and soon resulted in death, the clostridia localising and growing in internal organs such as the liver after death. C. perfringens has various enzymes that enable it to break down connective tissue materials, including collagen and hyaluronidase, thereby facilitating spread of the infection along tissue planes. Most of the enzymes are toxic (a) Reflex arc (top). Mechanism for inhibiting the antagonists to a muscle contracting in response to stretch. Muscles are reciprocally innervated with sensory and motor neurons, although for clarity this is shown only for the protagonist muscle. On stretch, the stretch receptors generate an impulse which is transmitted along the afferent sensory (S) neuron of the protagonist (P) muscle. This SP neuron enters the spinal cord by the dorsal root and synapses with the motor neuron supplying the protagonist muscle (MP) and with an interneuron (I) which in turn synapses with the motor neuron supplying the antagonist muscle (MA); the efferent motor neurons leave the spinal cord by the ventral root. At the SP/MP synapse an excitatory transmitter is released which induces an impulse in MP which leads to contraction of protagonist muscle. However, excitation of I causes release of an inhibitory transmitter at the I/MA synapse which leads to relaxation of the antagonist muscle.

However, one might ask why all enzymes with such biochemical specificity are not equally toxic or important in determining virulence; there are several reasons which can be put forward. By the combined use of monoclonal antibodies and molecular genetic analyses we now know that there are at least two functional domains in this C. perfringens \u03b1-toxin. If one compares C. perfringens \u03b1-toxin with the phosphatidyl choline-preferring, nontoxic phospholipase of Bacillus cereus, one finds that two-thirds of the N-terminal sequence shows homology with the entire sequence of B. cereus PLC. This portion of C. perfringens \u03b1-toxin retains its PLC activity but not its haemolytic and lethal activities. The C-terminal part is not haemolytic, not enzymatically active and not cytotoxic for mouse lymphocytes, but is necessary for conferring toxicity on the N-terminal part of the protein. In fact, the C-terminus is a potent immunogen that will solidly protect mice -and hopefully man-against experimental infection with C. perfringens. Surprisingly, the C-terminal domain of the nontoxic C. bifermentans enzyme shows sequence similarity with that of its C. perfringens \u03b1-toxin counterpart.

In fact, immunisation of mice against pneumolysin affords some protection against challenge infection. Second, in addition to its role in promoting invasive bacteraemia, pneumolysin has also been implicated in causing sensorineural deafness associated with meningitis caused by the pneumococcus; this perception is based on very recent work with a guinea-pig Other pore-forming toxins T h e R T X toxins h a v e a l r e a d y b e e n referred to above in connection w i t h B. pertussis A C -H l y .

This toxin acts in a manner similar to that of the SH-activated cytolysins, with an important difference: there is no initial specific binding. \u03b4-Toxin initially forms small pores and then islands of membrane or large micelles; this gives rise to its perceived detergent-like properties. There is a family of closely related \u03b4-toxins which inhibit the growth of gonococci. It is not often that one can ascribe a positive function to a toxin which is beneficial for the organism producing it. In this case 8-toxin(s) could have important ecological significance in the mixed culture situation that is characteristic of the real microbial world. Of great interest is the synergy that \u03b4-toxin displays. Sublytic amounts of \u03b4-toxin causes release of cell constituents without lysis. But, only 0.01 haemolytic units of staphylococcal \u00df-toxin will cause lysis of cells in the presence of 0.004 lytic units of \u03b4-toxin. This synergistic interaction could be the way in which staphylococcal toxins, which rarely exert their lethal effects in the majority of infections, exercise important cytolytic effects. Of less obvious significance is the fact that \u03b4-toxin is a poor antigen; for a long time its antigenicity was controversial. If \u03b4-toxin were to prove of crucial importance as a cytolytic potentiator, then this could also partly explain why natural acquired immunity to staphylococcal infection is either non-existent or sufficiently low as to be easily overcome.",

Like Streptolysin-0 and staphylococcal \u03b4-toxin, it is secreted as a water-soluble protein and undergoes self-induced oligomerisation on cell membranes to form pores. It has recently been suggested that transmembrane channels formed by the hexameric form allow the penetration of the monomeric form which interferes with certain steps in translation. In systemic staphylococcal infections death is most probably due to the potent \u03b1-toxin but in localised pyogenic infections-such as mastitis in cattle, goats, rabbits and mice-its role is most likely one of killing phagocytes or conferring survivability on intracellular bacteria. 7-Toxin is a binary toxin with a haemolytic action on rabbit erythrocytes. There is evidence that \u03b1, \u03b2 and 7 haemolysins and leucocidin are produced in vivo during natural and experimental infections. This is based on the presence of antibodies to these haemolysins in subjects undergoing staphylococcal infection and the extraction of toxin from peritoneal abscesses in mice.

Toxic shock syndrome is characterised by sudden onset of fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, an erythematous rash followed by peeling of the skin, hypotensive shock, impairment of renal and hepatic functions and occasionally death. The main symptoms of the disease have been reproduced in rabbits by implanting chamber-enclosed TSS-strains in the rabbit uterus or peritoneum or by injection of TSST-1 into rabbits. Complex changes are observed including: haemorrhage in kidney and liver; congestion and haematomas in the lungs; leakage of blood into the thymus; and fluid in the pericardial sac and in the gut lumen. These effects in rabbits are very similar to those seen in humans and would certainly explain the shock and diarrhoeal syndrome so characteristic of the disease. All of this indicates that the primary effect of TSST-1 is on the integrity of capillary walls. The lethal effect of TSST-1 is enhanced considerably by endotoxin (see below).

They are among the most powerful T cell mitogens known, acting at picomolar concentrations. They bind to MHC class II molecules on antigenpresenting cells and interact with the V\u00df chain of the T cell receptor (see Chs 6 and 7). This causes proliferation and cytokine release by the entire subset of T cells bearing that particular V\u00df chain-2-20% of all T cells are affected, whereas only 0.001-0.01% of T cells respond to a given regular antigen. This represents an important interference with a coordinated immune response, and the widespread polyclonal activation and cytokine release can be regarded as a microbial strategy, a 'diversion' of host immune defences. In addition, if the superantigen reacts with developing T cells (with the correct V\u00df chain) in the thymus, these cells are deleted. It seems probable, therefore, that this is a more important biological function of these toxins than the one responsible for the characteristic disease, which may be no more than an 'accidental' phenomenon.

Erythrogenic toxin is a low molecular weight protein produced in a complex form with hyaluronic acid, which acts as a carrier. The protein consists of two parts. One is heat labile, carries the determinants of immunological specificity which give rise to three serotypes, A, B and C, and is responsible for primary toxicity manifestations, including pyrogenicity, low lethality, cytotoxic effects on cultured spleen macrophages, and suppression of the reticuloendothelial and immune systems. The second part is heat stable, antigenically common to types A, B and C, and is responsible for secondary toxicity; that is, hypersensitivity effects, including skin hyperreactivity (the basis of the rash), myocardial necrosis, enhancement of pyrogenicity and lethality, and enhanced host response to other injurious agents. Thus, it is not possible to define the biological activity of 'erythrogenic' toxins without considering the immunological state of the host. An individual may suffer no reddening of the skin upon intradermal injection of erythrogenic toxin (negative Dick test) because a high neutralising titre of antibody blocks the primary toxiphore or because of a lack of hypersensitivity to the common antigen.",

Only when man comes into close proximity with infected rodents do outbreaks of human plague occur. The disease is spread from rat to rat and from rat to man by fleas. Rodents in the terminal stages of infection with Y. pestis suffer massive bacteraemia and so when a flea sucks the blood of an infected animal it swallows large numbers of bacteria. When the rodent eventually dies, the flea leaves the corpse and awaits a new host. In the meantime, however, Y. pestis multiplies rapidly in the alimentary tract of the insect, often completely blocking the proventriculus. The flea becomes voraciously hungry and feeds on any suitable host, which sooner or later is man. However, because the flea's alimentary canal is blocked by bacteria it cannot feed efficiently and usually succeeds in imbibing blood only to regurgitate it, now contaminated with Y. pestis, back into the wound. During the next 2-8 days, organisms become localised and multiply in the regional lymph nodes, causing considerable swelling. These swellings, which are often in the axillary and inguinal regions because the most common sites for flea-bites are the arms or legs, are referred to as primary buboes (Greek boubon = groin); hence the name bubonic plague. Secondary buboes may develop, followed by necrosis of the lymphoid tissue and vascular damage giving rise to haemorrhaging in many organs and tissues. These pathological changes are accompanied by prostration, high fever and delirium, followed in the terminal stages of the disease by shock and death. It is also possible for the disease to be transmitted from human to human by the aerosol route: exhaled organisms from heavily infected patients are capable of infecting others giving rise to pneumonic plague.",

The relationship of this type of molecule to the outer membrane is also shown in Fig. 8 .12. The long chain fatty acids interdigitate between the phospholipids in the outer leaflet and may also be linked (or interact) with lipoproteins, which in turn may or may not be covalently anchored to the rigid peptidoglycan (PG). The polysaccharide side chains project outwards. This structure is not invariant. For example, many organisms when first isolated give rise to colonies with a smooth appearance on agar but on subculture produce colonies with a rough appearance. In general, 'smooth' strains of pathogenic species are more virulent than rough strains. This S->R conversion is accompanied by a loss of region I side chains, which contain the deoxy and dideoxy sugars found in these LPS complexes. In addition to these somewhat drastic changes involving loss of side chains, it is possible to induce major compositional changes by manipulating the growth rate of these organisms in a chemostat. Thus the LPS of Salmonella enteriditis, when grown with a mean generation time of 20 min is nearly totally deficient in tyvelose (a dideoxy sugar), possesses 85% of the galactose and 150% of the glucose contents of LPS obtained when the generation time is 50 min. These genotypic S organisms exhibit an R-phenotype in terms of their vastly reduced O-agglutinability (see below); such observations are potentially very important in the context of the in vivo phenotype and pathogenicity, since it is well known that the growth rate of Salmonella typhimurium in mice is 10-20 times lower than in vitro.

Included among those effects which might play a role in Gram-negative bacterial infections, are abortion, pyrogenicity, tolerance (not immune tolerance), the Schwartzmann phenomenon, hypotension and shock, and lethality, but the precise part played by LPS in these phenomena in Gram-negative infections is far from clear. LPS causes the release of vasoactive substances, activates the alternative pathway of the complement cascade, and also activates factor XII (Hageman factor), the first step of the coagulation cascade, which sometimes results in disseminated intravascular coagulation (p. 258). Many, perhaps nearly all, the actions of LPS are due to the stimulation of cytokine release from macrophages and other cells. There is an effect on the circulation, leading ultimately to vascular collapse. The vascular regions most affected differ from species to species; in man and sheep the main changes are found in the lungs. LPS has powerful immunological actions, which is surely no accident; as well as activating the complement system, it induces IL-1 production and is a potent B cell mitogen. Man is one of the most sensitive of all species to the pyrogenic action of endotoxin. A dose of 2 n g per kg of body weight injected intravenously into man causes the release of an endogenous pyrogen (interleukin-1, see Glossary) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) from macrophages, which act on the hypothalamus to give an elevation of body temperature within an hour. It is possible that the pyrogenic action of LPS helps to generate fever in Gram-negative bacterial infections, but LPS is not the only bacterial factor capable of inducing a febrile response.",

It can, however, cause shock when Gram-negative bacteria invade the blood. It is for this reason that considerable effort in recent years has gone into the development of antilipid A antibodies for use as therapeutic agents to combat shock in such situations; the success rate is only partial and the expense enormous. For that reason several groups are seeking to exploit the wealth of chemical and biophysical information available on LPS in attempts to develop synthetic derivatives which would neutralise the biological activity of lipid A.

But remember that microbes that replicate inside host cells are less likely to form powerful toxins because they cannot afford to damage at too early a stage the cell in which they are multiplying. Thus, toxins are not prominent products in intracellular infections due to mycobacteria, Brucella, Rickettsiae, or Chlamydia, and viruses do not form toxins. Although a single molecule of a toxin like diphtheria toxin is enough to kill a cell, other toxins may do no more than impair cell function when present in sublethal concentrations.

This type of indirect nonimmunological damage is sometimes important in streptococcal infections. Virulent streptococci produce various toxins that damage phagocytes, and also bear on their surfaces substances that impede phagocytosis (see Ch. 4). Nevertheless, with the help of antibody, all streptococci are eventually phagocytosed and killed and the infection terminated. Unlike the staphylococci, however, killed group A streptococci pose a digestive problem for phagocytic cells. The peptidoglycan component of the streptococcal cell wall is very resistant to digestion by lysosomal enzymes. When streptococci are injected into the skin of a rabbit, for instance, streptococcal peptidoglycans persist in macrophages for as long as 146 days. Hence macrophages laden with indigestible streptococcal cell walls tend to accumulate in sites of infection. Lysosomal enzymes, including collagenase, leak from these macrophages, causing local destruction of collagen fibres and the connective tissue matrix. Macrophages secrete many other substances some of which may contribute to cell and tissue damage (see also p. 84). Many macrophages eventually die or form giant cells, sometimes giving rise to granulomatous lesions (see p. 292). In this way persistent streptococcal materials sometimes cause chronic inflammatory lesions in the infected host. An additional immunopathological contribution to the lesions is to be expected if the host is sensitised to peptidoglycan components. Other pathogenic microorganisms that are digested with difficulty by phagocytes include Listeria, Shigella, Candida albicans and, of course, Mycobacteria, but the importance of this in the pathogenesis of disease is not generally clear.",

Such changes caused by the immune response are classed as immunopathological. Sometimes they are very severe, leading to serious disease or death, but at other times they play a minimal part in the pathogenesis of disease. With the possible exception of certain vertically transmitted virus infections and the transmissible 'prion' dementias (see Ch. 10), there are signs of an immune response in all infections. Therefore it is to be expected that there will nearly always be some contribution of the immune response to pathological changes.* Often the immunological contribution is small, but sometimes it forms a major part of the disease. For instance, in tuberculosis the pathological picture is dominated by the operation of a strong and persistent CMI response to the invading bacillus. In the classical tubercle a central zone of bacilli with large mononuclear and giant cells, often with some necrosis, is surrounded by fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Mononuclear infiltrations, giant cells and granulomatous lesions (see p. 292) are characteristic pathological features of tuberculosis. There are no recognised toxins formed by tubercle bacilli, and there seems to be no single antigen or other component that accounts for virulence. Bacterial glycolipids (e.g. 'cord factor'), resistance to H 2 0 2 (see pp. 80-81) and ability to utilise host Fe (see p. 352) have been correlated with pathogenicity, and inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion in macrophages (see pp. 94-95) by release of unidentified bacterial components would also contribute to pathogenicity. However, none of these factors is by itself absolutely necessary for virulence, which in such a complex, ancient parasite is likely to be multifactorial. As a gene library for M. tuberculosis is slowly built up there will be opportunities for clearer definition of virulence determinants. When macrophages are killed by intracellular mycobacteria the lysosomal enzymes and other materials released from the degenerating cell contribute to chronic inflammation as in the case of the streptococcal lesions referred to above. * A number of different microbial antigens are produced during most infections (see Ch. 6) and the possible immunological reactions are therefore numerous.

Chorea, a disease of the central nervous system, is a rare complication of streptococcal infection and antistreptococcal antibodies have been shown to react with neurons in the caudate and subthalamic nuclei of the brain. A number of microorganisms have antigens similar to host tissue components (p. 173) so that in the course of responding immunologically to such infections the host is vulnerable to autoimmune damage (see ankylosing spondylitis, p. 200). The antibodies to host components such as DNA, IgG, myofibrils, erythrocytes etc. that are seen in trypanosomiasis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and EB virus infections appear to result from polyclonal activation of B cells (see p. 183). It is not clear how important these autoimmune responses are in pathogenesis, but they reflect fundamental disturbances in immunoregulation.",

Antigen-antibody reactions in tissues are not usually as serious as this, and milder inflammatory sequelae are more common as in the case of allergic alveolitis (see below), or the red zone seen round the borders of a smallpox vaccination site after seven or eight days. In the latter example circulating antibodies pass through vessel walls, meet vaccinia virus antigen in the dermal tissues and an inflammatory response is generated. A similar mild response can be induced experimentally to cause a reaction known as cutaneous anaphylaxis (see Glossary), the test antigen being injected into the skin and reacting with blood-borne antibody.

If there is a large excess of antibody, each antigen molecule is covered with antibody and is removed rapidly by reticuloendothelial cells, which have receptors for the Fc portion of the antibody molecule (see Ch. 4). When equal amounts of antigen and antibody combine, lattice structures are produced, and these form large aggregates whose size ensures that they are also rapidly removed by reticuloendothelial cells. If, however, complexes are formed in antigen excess, the poorly coated antigen molecules are not removed by reticuloendothelial cells. They continue to circulate in the blood and have the opportunity to localise in small blood vessels elsewhere in the body. The mechanism is not clear, but complexes are deposited in the glomeruli of the kidneys, the choroid plexuses, joints and ciliary body of the eye. Factors may include local high blood pressure and turbulent flow (glomeruli), or filtering function of vessels involved (choroid plexus, ciliary body). In the glomeruli the complexes pass through the endothelial windows (Fig. 8 .14) and come to lie beneath the basement membrane. The smallest-sized complexes pass through the basement membrane and seem to enter the urine. This is probably the normal mechanism of disposal of such complexes from the body. Immune complexes are formed in many, perhaps most, acute infectious diseases. Microbial antigens commonly circulate in the blood in viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal, rickettsial etc. infections. When the immune response has been generated and the first trickle of specific antibody enters the blood, immune complexes are formed in antigen excess. This is generally a transitional stage soon giving rise to antibody excess, as more and more antibody enters the blood and the infection is terminated. Sometimes the localisation of immune complexes and complement in kidney glomeruli is associated with a local inflammatory response.* There is an infiltration of polymorphs, swelling of the glomerular basement membrane, loss of albumin, even red blood cells, in the urine and the patient has acute glomerulonephritis. This is seen following streptococcal infections, mainly in children (see below). As complexes cease to be formed the changes are reversed, and complete recovery is the rule. Repeated attacks or persistent deposition of complexes leads to irreversible damage, often with proliferation of epithelial cells following the seepage of fibrin into the urinary space.",

Also, the filtering area is itself blocked by the mesangial cell intrusion, by the accumulation of complexes (Fig. 8.14) , and by alterations in the structure of the basement membrane. The foot processes of epithelial cells tend to fuse and further interfere with filtration. The pathological processes continue, some glomeruli ceasing to produce urine, and the individual has chronic glomerulonephritis.

Antigens that are disposed of with difficulty in the body are more likely to be important inducers of granulomas. Thus, although mannan is the dominant antigen of Candida albicans, glucan is more resistant to breakdown in macrophages and is responsible for chronic inflammatory responses.",

When virus is injected intracerebrally into adult mice it grows in the meninges, ependyma and choroid plexus epithelium, but the infected cells do not show the slightest sign of damage or dysfunction. After 7-10 days, however, the mouse develops severe meningitis with submeningeal and subependymal oedema, and dies. The illness can be completely prevented by adequate immunosuppression, and the lesions are attributable to the mouse's own vigorous CD8 + T cell response to infected cells. These cells present processed LCM viral peptides on their surface in conjunction with MHC I proteins, and sensitised CD8 + T cells, after entering the cerebrospinal fluid and encountering the infected cells, generate the inflammatory response and interference with normal neural function that cause the disease. The same cells destroy infected tissue cells in vitro, but tissue destruction is not a feature of the neurological disease. In this disease the CD8 + T cells probably act by liberating inflammatory cytokines. It may be noted that the brain is uniquely vulnerable to inflammation and oedema, as pointed out earlier in this chapter. The infected mouse shows the same type of lesions in scattered foci of infection in the liver and elsewhere, but they are not a cause of sickness or death. LCM infection of mice is a classical example of immunopathology in which death itself is entirely due to the cell-mediated immune response of the infected individual. This response, although apparently irrelevant and harmful, is nevertheless an 'attempt' to do the right thing. It has been shown that immune T cells effectively inhibit LCM viral growth in infected organs. However, a response that in most extraneural sites would be useful and appropriate turns out to be self-destructive when it takes place in the central nervous system.",

Normally when an appropriate number of T cells had entered the lungs, the T cells would issue a feedback response to prevent such over-accumulation, but it is thought that influenza virus infects the T cells and inhibits this control process, so that the lungs are eventually overwhelmed.

Instead of the limited extent of virus growth and disease seen in the respiratory tract in normal children, there is inexorable multiplication of virus in the lung, in spite of antibody formation, giving rise to giant cell pneumonia.

An infectious disease is an important stress, and corticosteroids are secreted in large amounts in severe infections (see also Ch. 11). They generally tend to inhibit the development of pathological changes, but also have pronounced effects on lymphoid tissues, causing thymic involution and lymphocyte destruction. These can be regarded as pathological changes caused by stress.

The pathways of this communication are still poorly understood. Work on Mycobacterium bovis grew out of observations from the turn of the century that stress appears to increase the death rate in children with TB. In one type of experiment mice were stressed by being kept in a restraining device where movement was virtually impossible. This resulted in the reduction of expression of MHC class II antigens on macrophages, which correlated with increased susceptibility to infection. Similarly stressing mice infected with influenza virus caused several immunosuppressive events including reduction of inflammatory cells in the lung, and decreased production of interleukin-2. Suppression of antibody responses is found in people suffering a type of stress familiar to students-examinations! The best responses to hepatitis B vaccine in students immunised on the third day of their examinations were found in those who reported the least stress.

Yellow fever is a virus infection transmitted by mosquitoes and in its severest form is characterised by devastating liver lesions. There is massive mid-zonal liver necrosis following the extensive growth of virus in liver cells, resulting in the jaundice that gives the disease its name. Destruction of the liver also leads to a decrease in the rate of formation of the blood coagulation factor, prothrombin, and infected human beings or monkeys show prolonged coagulation and bleeding times. Haemorrhagic phenomena are therefore characteristic of severe yellow fever, including haemorrhage into the stomach and intestine. In the stomach the appearance of blood is altered by acid, and the vomiting of altered blood gave yellow fever another of its names, 'black vomit disease'. Haemorrhagic phenomena in infectious diseases can be due to direct microbial damage to blood vessels, as in certain rickettsial infections (see p. 127) or in the virus infection responsible for haemorrhagic disease of deer. They may also be due to immunological damage to vessels as in the Arthus response or immune complex vasculitis, to any type of severe inflammation, and to the indirect mechanism illustrated above. Finally there are a few infectious diseases in which platelets are depleted, sometimes as a result of their combination with immune complexes plus complement, giving thrombocytopenia and a haemorrhagic tendency (see also disseminated intravascular coagulation, p. 258).

On the other hand, a given infection generates antimicrobial responses such as as interferon production and macrophage activation which would make a second infection less likely. Dual infections are commonest when local defences have been damaged by the first invader. The pathological results are made much more severe because there is a second infectious agent present. This can be considered as another mechanism of pathogenicity. Classical instances involve the respiratory tract. The destruction of ciliated epithelium in the lung by viruses such as influenza or measles allows normally nonpathogenic resident bacteria of the nose and throat, such as the pneumococcus or Haemophilus influenzae, to invade the lung and cause secondary pneumonia. If these bacteria enter the lung under normal circumstances, they are destroyed by alveolar macrophages or removed by the mucociliary escalator. In at least one instance the initial virus infection appears to act by interfering with the function of alveolar macrophages. Mice infected with parainfluenza 1 (Sendai) virus show greatly increased susceptibility to infection with Haemophilus influenzae, and this is largely due to the fact that alveolar macrophages infected with virus show a poor ability to phagocytose and kill the bacteria. Specialised respiratory pathogens such as influenza, measles, parainfluenza or rhinoviruses damage the naso-* One genes (oncogenes) are also present in host cells, where they play a role in normal growth and differentiation, often coding for recognised growth factors (e.g. human platelet-derived growth factor).

Under these conditions animals suffer a more severe viral infection. This results from the need to proteolytically cleave the viral haemagglutinin protein which is done by a cellular enzyme.

It is estimated that on a global scale diarrhoea is responsible for 3-6 million deaths per year in children under five years old. In villages in West Africa and Guatemala the average 2-3-year-old child has diarrhoea for about two months in each year.* Diarrhoea also interacts with malnutrition and can cause stunted growth, defective immune responses and susceptibility to other infections (pp. 343-5). Diarrhoea is also a common affliction of travellers from developed countries, * Diarrhoea on a massive scale is not always confined to developing countries. There was a major outbreak of Cryptosporidium infection in Milwaukee, USA, in 1993 with more than 400 000 cases; 285 of these were diagnosed in the laboratory and they suffered watery diarrhoea (mean 12 stools a day) for a mean of nine days.

First, a quick resume of the normal structure and function of gut before attempting to understand the processes whereby it may be perturbed. The main function of the gut is the active inward transport of ions and nutrient solutes which is followed by the passive movement of water ( Fig. 8.15 ). The driving force is the Na + /K + ATPase situated in the basolateral membrane of enterocytes on the villus (Fig. 8.16 ) which maintains a low intracellular [Na\" 1 \"] thus creating the electrochemical gradient favourable for Na + entry and, a high regional [Na + ] in the intercellular spaces; Cl~ follows Na + . A similar situation exists in crypt cells: Na + /K + ATPase drives secretion. The key difference is the location of the carrier systems responsible for the facilitated entry of the actively transported species. In villus cells the carriers are present in the brush border, whereas in crypt cells they are located in the basal membrane: this is responsible for the vectorial aspects of ion/fluid traffic in villus/crypt assemblies. However, it is clear that several factors in addition to enterocytes are involved in * Liquid faeces are not abnormal in all species. The domestic cow experiences life-long diarrhoea, but presumably does not suffer from it.

The coupled antiports are functionally linked via H + and HC0 3~, the relative concentrations of which are a reflection of metabolic activity. These processes occur within the same cells but are shown separately for clarity. The driving force for N a + uptake is the low Na + concentration maintained by the Na + /K + pump (ATPase) which creates the electrochemical gradient which promotes the inward movement of Na + ; Cl~ follows N a + by diffusion. Water is drawn osmotically across the epithelium paracellularly (i.e. across tight junctions) and/or transcellularly, the former pathway accounting for approximately 80% of fluid movement.",

The hypertonic zone has been demonstrated directly in whole villi of infant mice in terms of the changing morphology of erythrocytes: in the lower regions of villi they show characteristic discoid morphology, whereas in the upper region they are crenated, indicating a hyperosmotic environment. The hypertonicity is dissipated if the blood flow is too slow and washed out if too fast. It is the villus unit rather than enterocytes by themselves which is responsible for fluid uptake. Another consequence of the microcirculatory anatomy is that villus tip regions are relatively hypoxic.

A major study of rota virus-induced diarrhoea in neonatal mice provides a different model of this important disease of children. Oral infection of baby mice with a murine strain of rotavirus resulted in virus replication in enterocytes of the small intestine. Before there had been detectable virus replication, villi became ischaemic, enterocytes severely damaged and villi shortened. In gut enterocytes this virus was demonstrably not cytopathic; the cell damage and villus responses were almost identical to that seen in experimentally induced ischaemia in physiological experiments. At the peak of virus replication, which was coincident with maximum shortening of villi, the gut was still absorptive, glucose transport intact and sufficient lactase activity remained to deal with the normal lactose load delivered to the stomach. After this the gut became secretory and diarrhoea clinically evident. Villi were rapidly regenerated, but hyperaemia and diarrhoea persisted until the regeneration of the hypertonic zones as judged by the morphology of the red blood cells. Peak diarrhoea coincided with the resynthesis of new villi (as judged by thymidine kinase levels, increased mitotic activity and morphometric analyses), and increased levels of intracellular NaCl in the zone of cells where cell division was most active. Transiently high levels of NaCl have also been observed in dividing cells in culture. Since ischaemic and hyperaemic villi were occasionally seen in control villi it may well be the case that the pathological changes reflect an exaggerated synchronised response of basic circulatory control mechanisms, which are part of the normal homeostatic mechanisms of villus physiology. Thus, the pathophysiology of rotavirus-induced diarrhoea in neonatal mice may be summarised as follows: the reduction of red blood cells flowing through villi in the early stages of infection instigates hypoxia and hence atrophy of villi. The degree of atrophy in this infection is not associated with lack of absorption. The ensuing villus repair processes induce hypersecretion. The increase in blood flow throughout the remaining course of the infection reduces the hypertonicity of villi which impairs water absorption and thus prolongs diarrhoea. The preceding description of the self-limiting diarrhoea induced by rotavirus in neonatal mice is probably applicable to many diarrhoeas. However, the observed pathology may be different according to age, species, or the inducing pathogen. For example, in rotavirus-infected lambs, villus atrophy and crypt hypertrophy occur (the latter indicative of crypt cell division) but as in mice, infected lambs are not lactose intolerant.",

The latter has often been used as the model for infantile diarrhoea but the question is whether human infants are more like piglets or lambs. Clinical studies have shown that recovery from mild, acute gastroenteritis of rota virus origin occurs within two weeks irrespective of the carbohydrate ingested. Clearly, the severity of disease and the clinical outcome will depend on the extent of Vertical' villus/ crypt involvement and the regions of intestine infected. When villus erosion is severe, then lactose may cause an 'osmotic' purge or be fermented by intestinal bacteria to short chain fatty acids which stimulate secretion in the colon. Astroviruses, Norwalk virus, certain coronaviruses, certain adenoviruses and probably toroviruses all cause gastroenteritic disease by infecting enterocytes. However, parvoviruses cause severe intestinal disease in dogs by virtue of their predilection for the mitotically active crypt cells; this causes the near complete erosion of villi similar to that seen after exposure to sublethal doses of irradiation.",

            "text": "The classic paradigm for bacterial watery diarrhoea is cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae in the small intestine. V. cholerae attaches to enterocytes of the proximal small bowel and is capable of producing at least three toxins: classical cholera toxin (CT); a toxin which disrupts the zonula occludens tight junction (designated ZOT); and another less well defined, auxilliary cholera enterotoxin (designated ACE). As a result of toxic action, water and electrolytes are lost through the intact epithelial cells into the small intestine. As the multiplying bacteria increase in numbers and more and more epithelial cells are affected, the absorptive capacity of the colon is overwhelmed and there is profuse watery diarrhoea, as much as l l h -1 in severe cases.* The massive loss of isotonic fluid with excess of sodium bicarbonate and potassium leads to hypovolaemic shock, acidosis and haemoconcentration. Anuria develops, and the collapsed, lethargic patient may die in 12-24 h. Lives are saved by replacing the lost water and salts. The effect of toxin on an intestinal epithelial cell is long lasting, but the patient recovers as affected cells are shed and replaced in the normal fashion. The infection is particularly severe in children who easily develop low levels of plasma potassium. However, on a global scale this greatly feared disease, cholera, is only responsible for less than 1% of the total deaths due to diarrhoea.",

The effect of ZOT has been demonstrated by electron microscopy in human biopsies, but the relative importance of ZOT and ACE in human disease has not been quantified. How does CT work? As already outlined (pp. 216-19) the A subunit of this toxin is an ADPribosyl transferase whose target is the a s subunit of the regulatory G protein which governs the expression of adenylate cyclase and hence the production of cAMP. This in turn results in the perturbation of the transport systems leading to a net efflux of ions and hence water. Things are slightly more complicated, because elevation of cAMP occurs in villus tip cells (hence affecting absorption) but not in crypt cells. Probably a signal is generated in intoxicated tip enterocytes which is transmitted to the crypt region by the ENS causing release of neurotransmitters (e.g. serotonin, acetyl choline, and vasoactive peptide) which act on enterochromaffin (secretory) cells and on intestinal smooth muscle thereby augmenting crypt secretion and increasing peristalsis. Studies have been made of sequential histological changes in human biopsies, taken from a series of patients from the onset of symptoms to recovery. It was clear that fluid secretion was not the result of massive desquamation of the epithelium. Histological changes included 'engorgement of the capillaries' (i.e. interference with the blood supply), 'dilation of lacteals, vacuolation of enterocytes, exhaustion atrophy of enterocytes' (remember this is a noninvasive pathogen), 'accelerated shedding of cells, and increased mitotic activity'. Most of these changes are similar to those described above for experimental murine rotavirus at post-peak diarrhoea and it seems that the range of histological reactions that can occur in the small intestine are limited so that qualitatively the picture is similar in different diarrhoeas.",

It is stopping effective colonisation which is important rather than neutralisation of the toxin. This has been partially achieved by using killed whole cell vaccines. Several attempts have been made in the laboratory to genetically manipulate virulent strains (in practice this means deleting or inactivating the known toxin genes) such that the attenuated strain will colonise the gut and stimulate local immune responses and thereby prevent colonisation of the gut by virulent strains. To date, attenuated strains have been developed which fulfil these criteria but induce a mild transient diarrhoea which has prevented their adoption into vaccination programmes. However the recent emergence of V. cholerae strain 0139 (a new, third type) in India and Bangladesh is a reminder that today's solution may not be adequate for tomorrow's problems.

            "text": "The picture withi\u00a3. coli is complicated since there are several biotypes of this pathogen which include: ETEC (enterotoxigenic E. coli, the principal cause of travellers' diarrhoea), EPEC (enteropathogenic E. coli), EIEC (enteroinvasive E. coli), and EHEC (enterohaemorrhagic E. coli) variants (see Ch. 2). The situation with ETEC is very similar to V. cholerae as far as heat labile toxin (LT, which is very closely related to CT) is concerned. It is additionally complicated by the fact that some strains of ETEC also make heat stable toxins (STs), which are nonantigenic low molecular weight peptides which activate membrane-bound guanylate cyclase which causes the production of cGMP which is the functional equivalent of cAMP. The 'classical' EPEC lesion is the formation of a characteristic pedestal-like lesion in the brush border of enterocytes with only limited invasion of the mucosa. Just how it causes diarrhoea is not wholly clear. EIEC is almost indistinguishable from Shigella, and causes similar disease. EHEC strains, which belong mainly (but not exclusively) to serogroup 0157:H7, cause a spectrum of intestinal disease ranging from asymptomatic carriage through mild diarrhoea to severe haemorrhagic colitis. They also cause extraintestinal infections such as haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). The initial lesion seen in the gut is similar to that caused by EPEC but EHEC do not remain localised there: they multiply in the lamina propria and glandular crypts. While there is no conclusive proof of the involvement of SLT in the pathogenesis of EHEC diarrhoea there is a correlation between SLT production and the severity of diarrhoeal disease or HUS caused by this organism. Salmonella spp. cause acute gastroenteritis and systemic typhoid disease in man, as well as other important infections in domestic animals. Virulence in Salmonella, especially in their natural hosts (see Table 8 .7, footnote) isxomplex and mediated by numerous genes, some of which are present in otherwise nonpathogenic organisms such as E. coli. Presumably all these bacteria share nutritional and environmental problems, whether inside or outside a host, that call for such genes. Those restricted to Salmonella are more likely to be critical in vivo. The clinical features of Salmonella-induced diarrhoea (gastroenteritis) in humans and systemic typhoid infections are quite different. For example, gastroenteritis may follow 8-36 h after ingestion of contaminated food, whereas typhoid follows an incubation period of 10-20 days. Diarrhoea, (which is usually watery, but may be severe, and sometimes bloody) is the predominating feature of gastroenteritis, whereas in adults, constipation is seen in the early clinical stages of typhoid; diarrhoea may occur much later. Although fever may occur in gastroenteritis, in typhoid this may be so severe as to cause delirium. Current perceptions are that gastroenteritis results from the initial interactions of Salmonella (any one of many serotypes but frequently typhimurium or enteriditis, and/or their products) with the gut mucosa, whereas typhoid fever is produced by S. typhi organisms which translocate the mucosa, survive within macrophages, multiply and release endotoxin which triggers the highly complex endotoxin cascade. Gastroenteritis is usually self-limiting, whereas in untreated typhoid mortality can be as high as 10%. The pathophysiology of fluid secretion caused by Salmonellae is highly complex and as yet incompletely understood. The only two biological parameters which have been shown to correlate with induction of fluid secretion in a rabbit model (the best available small laboratory animal for human gastroenteritis) is the ability to invade the gut mucosa, and the induction of a leucocyte (mainly polymorphonuclear cell) influx into the mucosa and lumen of the gut. Fluid secretion does not correlate per se with the ability to make an enterotoxin: avirulent as well as virulent strains make a cholera-like toxin though neither appear to release the toxin readily. The latter is therefore either not primarily involved, or is involved only after release from bacteria by means other than normal protein secretion mechanisms. These questions are as yet unresolved and the reader is referred to the reference list for a fuller discussion of these complex matters.",

They are primarily parasites of animals, ranging from pythons to elephants, and their importance for man is their great tendency to colonise domestic animals. Pigs and poultry are commonly affected, and human disease follows the consumption of contaminated meat or eggs. b Other campylobacters cause sepsis, abortion and enteritis in animals. ranging from asymptomatic carriage through mild antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) to fatal pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). Normal flora play a major part-by means which are still not completely understood-in suppressing outgrowth of resident C. difficile spores. Disruption of the normal flora, by antibiotic treatment for example, results in vegetative growth and production of several toxins of which C. difficile toxin A seems to be the most important in disease. This toxin is responsible for the secretory and inflammatory response in the intestine, and epithelial disruption. It probably acts by disrupting tight junctions between cells, and by causing chemotactic and other responses in polymorphs. Diarrhoea could be due to the destruction of the 'absorptive epithelium' and failure to cope with the normal fluid load delivered by the small intestine, or an active type of secretion caused by replacement of the damaged epithelium, or both.",
