            "text": "Tropical rainforests show the highest level of terrestrial biodiversity and may be an important contributor to microbial diversity. Exploitation of these ecosystems may foster the emergence of novel pathogens. We report the discovery of the first insect-associated nidovirus, tentatively named Cavally virus (CAVV). CAVV was found with a prevalence of 9.3% during a survey of mosquito-associated viruses along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Analysis of habitat-specific virus diversity and ancestral state reconstruction demonstrated an origin of CAVV in a pristine rainforest with subsequent spread into agriculture and human settlements. Virus extension from the forest was associated with a decrease in virus diversity (P < 0.01) and an increase in virus prevalence (P < 0.00001). CAVV is an enveloped virus with large surface projections. The RNA genome comprises 20,108 nucleotides with seven major open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a and -1b encode two large proteins that share essential features with phylogenetically higher representatives of the order Nidovirales, including the families Coronavirinae and Torovirinae, but also with families in a basal phylogenetic relationship, including the families Roniviridae and Arteriviridae. Genetic markers uniquely conserved in nidoviruses, such as an endoribonuclease-and helicase-associated zinc-binding domain, are conserved in CAVV. ORF2a and -2b are predicted to code for structural proteins S and N, respectively, while ORF3a and -3b encode proteins with membrane-spanning regions. CAVV produces three subgenomic mRNAs with 5= leader sequences (of different lengths) derived from the 5= end of the genome. This novel cluster of mosquito-associated nidoviruses is likely to represent a novel family within the order Nidovirales. IMPORTANCE Knowledge of microbial diversity in tropical rainforests is sparse, and factors driving the emergence of novel pathogens are poorly understood. We discovered and mapped the spread and genetic evolution of a novel mosquito nidovirus from a pristine rainforest to human settlements. Notably, virus diversity decreased and prevalence increased during the process of spreading into disturbed habitats. The novel virus, tentatively termed Cavally virus, contains genetic features common to members of the order Nidovirales (families Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, and Roniviridae), including conservation of the replicase machinery and expression of subgenomic RNA messages, has a basal phylogenetic relationship to the family Coronaviridae, and clearly differs from the established nidovirus families. Inclusion of this putative novel family in the nidovirus phylogeny suggests that nidoviruses may have evolved from arthropods.",

Intensive land use changes in West African rainforests began in the 1960s by industrial deforestation, leaving only remnants of the equatorial forest belt (4) (5) (6) . Patches of forest are typically surrounded by agricultural land and human settlements. Logging is linked to a profound decline in biodiversity (4, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Declines in biodiversity are associated with an increased risk of infectious disease emergence in humans and domestic animals (reviewed in reference 13) .

All nidoviruses encode two replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, encoded by open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1b located at the 5= end of the genome and followed by genes encoding structural proteins and, in most cases, several accessory (nonessential) proteins. A distinctive feature of nidoviruses is their transcription strategy. Genes downstream of the replicase polyprotein gene are expressed from a nested set of 3=-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs (in Latin, nidus means nest) (24) (25) (26) (27) . In this study, analyses of subgenomic mRNAs and major features of genome organization and phylogenetic analysis were employed for a taxonomic classification of a novel insect nidovirus. The summation of results suggests the discovery of a previously unrecognized family within the order Nidovirales.",

As shown in Table 1 , virus was most frequently isolated from Culex mosquitoes, especially Culex nebulosus. Mosquitoes of the genera Aedes, Anopheles, and Uranotaenia were also found to be infected but at lower rates. CAVV was present in all sampled habitat types but with the highest prevalence in human settlements (Table 1) . Analysis of variance showed the observed virus isolation rate in human settlements (and only there) to be significantly different from the mean isolation rates (F test, P \u03fd 0.00001) and from all isolation rates in any other habitat. In order to gain insight into the genetic diversity of CAVV, a 603-nucleotide (nt) genome fragment representing the 1b polymerase gene region was amplified and sequenced from all positive pools. The pairwise genetic distance between the isolates was up to 15% at the nucleotide level and up to 9.9% at the amino acid level. In particular, the nucleotide distance of isolate CAVV/A4/CI/2004 from all other isolates ranged between 13.5 and 15%, whereas the range of distances was below 1.8% for all other CAVV isolates. This suggested the presence of a diversified virus population comprising two different clusters whose distance is compatible with different species. CAVV is an insect-associated virus whose hosts were encountered along a gradient of anthropogenic habitat modifications. To examine possible influences of habitat modification on virus diversity, average nucleotide distances over sequence pairs were determined within the amplified 603-nt fragments from all pools and were assigned to one of the habitat types from where the respective isolates originated, i.e., (i) primary forest or research camps within a primary forest (9 isolates), (ii) secondary forest (5 isolates), (iii) plantations (6 isolates), and (iv) villages (19 isolates). The mean numbers of nucleotide exchanges in pairwise sequence comparisons were determined within the samples pertaining to each habitat type. CAVV/A4/CI/2004 was excluded to prevent bias from a virus that may be evolutionarily disconnected from the main clade (putative second species). In habitat types i to iv, the mean pairwise exchange rates within the 603-nt fragment were 4.35, 2.8, 0.6, and 2, respectively. Even though isolates from villages predominated numerically in the data set, the level of diversification was highest in primary forest (chi-square test on exchange rates, P \u03fd 0.01).",

CAVV/A4/CI/ 2004 was used as an outgroup. Phylogenies were subjected to ancestral state reconstruction under a parsimony assumption. These simple models of phylogeny and trait evolution were chosen because the ordered and sparse pattern of nucleotide exchange across the alignment suggested the absence of multiple or saturating exchanges. As shown in Fig. 1 , ancestral state reconstruction suggested the most recent common ancestor linked to the outgroup, as well as the common ancestor of the ingroup, to have existed in a primary forest habitat. This matches the general concept wherein novel viruses are being transferred to areas of human settlement in the course of agricultural exploitation of primary habitats.",

Virus growth kinetics and morphological presentation in insect cells were studied. Cells showed strong cytopathic effects (CPE) manifesting in aggregation of cells at 48 h postinfection (hpi) ( Fig. 2A and B) . Virus replication was measured by real-time RT-PCR every 3 h for 2 days. Maximal RNA concentrations were reached at 15 to 18 hpi, indicating a fast replication cycle (Fig. 2C) . Enveloped, spherical CoV-like virions with a mean diameter of 120 nm and large, clubshaped surface projections were detected in cell culture supernatants at 48 hpi by negative staining electron microscopy (Fig. 3) . In ultrathin sections of fixed insect cells analyzed by transmission electron microscopy at 48 hpi, vesicles containing spherical, potentially enveloped particles were observed in the cytoplasm of infected cells. These were 50 to 60 nm in diameter and lacked surface projections ( Fig. 3A and B) . A role for these vesicles filled with virions resembling steps during virus maturation, as shown for other plus-strand RNA viruses, remains to be investigated (28) (29) (30) . Furthermore, tubular structures likely of viral origin were detected in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 3A) .

            "text": "Using TMHMM v2.0, three hydrophobic regions comprising putative multiple membrane-spanning domains (TMD1 25 L-L 47 , TMD2 1128 I-Y 1272 , and TMD3 1727 Y-M 1780 ) were identified within the first predicted ORF of the CAVV genome. Three TMDs are also found in ORF1a of CoV and ToV, whereas RoV has four TMDs (18) . However, the position of CAVV TMD1 was similar to that in RoV (18) . Between TMD2 and TMD3, a putative 3CL pro domain was identified. Comparative sequence analysis suggested that the CAVV 3CL pro domain is a cysteine protease with a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad (see Fig. S1a (Fig. S1c) . Although short regions with low similarity suggest conservation of the ExoN and MT domains, reliable alignments could not be generated and biochemical evidence remains to be obtained to confirm the functionality of these domains. Putative RFS. Expression of the second major ORF of nidoviruses involves a programmed ribosomal frameshift into the \u03ea1 reading frame, occurring just upstream of the ORF1a stop codon (32, 33) . The overlap region of ORF1a and -1b typically contains a slippery heptanucleotide sequence and a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure that together promote ribosomal frameshifting (32, 33) . With minor variations, previously identified nidovirus slippery sequences conform to the XXXYYYZ consensus sequence conserved in many ribosomal slip sites on viral RNAs (for a review, see reference 42). Thus, for example, ArV, CoV, and ToV use 5=-(U/G)UUAAAC and RoV uses 5=-AAAUUUU as a slippery sequence (18, 42) . The short (~35-nt) ORF1a/1b overlap region in CAVV does not contain heptanucleotide sequences related to those of other nidoviruses. The only XXXYYYZ-like sequence identified in this region of the CAVV genome is 7829 CCCUUUG. However, previous systematic mutagenesis studies of ribosomal slip sites (43) revealed that the CCCUUUG heptanucleotide sequence does not promote efficient \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting in vitro and, to our knowledge, has not been reported to mediate efficient ribosomal frameshifting in viral or cellular systems. Further analyses revealed 7835 GGAUUUU as a further candidate slip site. The GGAUUUU sequence conforms to the simultaneousslippage model introduced by Jacks et al. (44) . More importantly, data obtained for red clover necrotic mosaic (diantho) virus (RC-NMV) (45, 46) have shown that this sequence mediates efficient \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting and thus expression of the downstream p57 polymerase ORF of RCNMV. Furthermore, the CAVV 7835 GGAUUUU sequence is located 5 nt upstream of an energetically favorable RNA secondary structure. Both the length of the spacer element and the presence of a putative stem-loop structure adjacent to the proposed frameshift site support the idea that CAVV ORF1b expression is mediated by \u03ea1 ribosomal frame- shifting at this site. Even though direct experimental evidence would be desirable to further corroborate this prediction, it seems reasonable to suggest that ORF1a/1b-encoded sequences are fused at a 2491 Leu-Asp-Phe-Ser junction site.",

ArV and CoV subgenomic mRNAs contain a common 5= leader sequence derived from the 5= terminus of the genomic RNA. The leader template is fused to nascent minus strand mRNA templates via a copy choicerelated template switching process called discontinuous extension of minus strands or discontinuous transcription (DT) (47, 48) . Copy choice occurs at transcription-regulating sequences (TRS), comprising short conserved sequence motifs that follow the leader and precede each downstream gene's ORF (48) (49) (50) . In contrast, the subgenomic mRNAs of RoV do not contain leader sequences (24) . Synthesis of subgenomic mRNA templates is believed to be mediated solely by attenuation of minus strand synthesis, involving mRNA transcription on minus-stranded replicative intermediates (nondiscontinuous transcription [NDT]) (26) .

            "text": "To identify potential fusion sites indicative of DT, one-step RT-PCRs were conducted for each sgRNA detected by Northern blotting. Sense primers were placed at intervals starting from the 5= end of the genome approximately 300 nt into the genomic sequence (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Antisense primers were selected according to the projected sizes of the sgRNAs. RT-PCRs targeting the 4.7-kb and 2.7-kb bands resulted in products with sense primers up to at least 126 and 152 nt, respectively, from the 5= end of the genome. The 1.8-kb band was associated with PCR products up to 202 nt from the 5= end of the genome. PCR products of various and unexpected sizes were observed for the smaller potential sgRNAs (i.e., all sgRNAs smaller than the 1.8-kb band in the Northern blot). Representative PCR products for all putative sgRNAs were cloned and sequenced. PCR products of unexpected sizes from small subgenomic mRNAs yielded sequences indicative of misprimed amplification in various positions of the genome, and it was concluded that these subgenomic mRNAs were generated by NDT, lacking a leader consistent with the Northern blotting results. The three sgRNAs that were clearly codetected with 5= and 3= probes revealed potential sites of fusions between genome leader and downstream mRNA sequences. Different sites were used for each sgRNA, as shown in Fig. 4B . Nevertheless, all sgRNAs had an A/C-rich region immediately downstream of the fusion region in common. It should be noted that Northern blot detection intensities of the 4.7-kb and 2.7-kb bands corresponded well between the 5= and 3= probes, whereas the detection intensity of the 1.8-kb band was much greater with the 3= probe than with the 5= probe (Fig. 4C) . This matched the presence of a much smaller fusion region in the RT-PCR product of the 1.8-kb sgRNA. Given the high intensity of the 1.8-kb band, we suspected that a major fraction of the total amount of this sgRNA would not contain a fused leader element; nonetheless, several variant fusion sites were detected in parallel clones for all subgenomic mRNAs. Further studies are required to characterize in more detail the various CAVV RNA species and their functional relevance in CAVV genome expression.",

            "text": "Initial predictions on structural protein genes. Sequence analyses of proteins predicted to be expressed from the 5 major ORFs in the 3=-proximal region of the CAVV genome revealed little (if any) similarity with other viral (and cellular) proteins, confirming that CAVV diverged profoundly from other nidoviruses and complicating functional assignments of these proteins. As summarized in Table 2 , two proteins are expected to be expressed from sgRNA 2. ORF2a is predicted to encode a type I glycoprotein featuring a C-terminal membrane-spanning domain and multiple glycosylation sites. Based on these predictions, the protein likely represents a functional equivalent of the S protein of other nidoviruses, which remains to be confirmed in further studies. The predicted translation start codon of ORF2b is the second AUG on the subgenomic mRNA2, located just downstream of the ORF2a start codon, suggesting that ORF2b may be translated by a leaky scanning mechanism. ORF2b encodes a highly basic protein (pK a , 10.8) with a molecular mass of 24 kDa. Both its size and its charge suggest that this protein may be the viral nucleocapsid protein. Among nidoviruses, this upstream position of the (presumed) N protein gene in the CAVV genome is unusual but has its precedent in members of the family Roniviridae (52). ORF3a and -3b encode proteins with predicted molecular masses of 18 and 14 kDa, respectively. Database searches failed to reveal close homologs of these proteins. Protein analysis software predicts the presence of membrane-spanning domains in both proteins (residues 95 to 117 in ORF3a and residues 73 to 95 in ORF3b), suggesting that both proteins are integral membrane proteins. The ORF3a protein likely contains a signal peptidase cleavage site, 15 Ala-Met-Ser|Ala-Glu, and is predicted to be glycosylated, further supporting a role as a membrane-spanning structural protein of the virus. The specific mechanism used to express the ORF3b gene product is unclear but may involve internal ribosomal entry, as shown previously for several downstream ORFs expressed from coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs (53) (54) (55) (56) . Further studies are required to establish if ORF3a and ORF3b proteins have functions related to those of the membrane-spanning M and E proteins of other nidoviruses. ORF4 encodes a small protein of 50 amino acid residues with unknown functions.",

In order to identify the phylogenetic relationship of CAVV with other nidoviruses, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of protein alignments of conserved motifs within 3CL pro (ORF1a), RdRp, and HEL (ORF1b), as well as the putative structural S protein (Fig. 5) . In all phylogenies, CAVV branched from a deep node in the nidovirus tree above the Roniviridae family. In the ORF1b and S genes, CAVV had a most recent ancestor in common with the subfamilies Torovirinae and Coronavirinae. In 3CL pro , it branched from an ancestor it has in common with the subfamily Torovirinae. The low bootstrap support at this root point suggested that CAVV might also branch from an ancestor it has in common with Torovirinae and Coronavirinae. Although formal classification criteria for nidoviruses are not established, this phylogenetic positioning suggested CAVV to be a profoundly separated cluster of nidoviruses that might constitute a new family of nidoviruses with a phylogenetic position between Roniviridae and Coronaviridae on one side and Arteriviridae on the other.",

Based on morphology, conserved genome motifs, and phylogenetic relationship, CAVV cannot be assigned to one of the established nidovirus families. Further investigations are required to elucidate further details of the CAVV replication apparatus and structural protein functions. It is unknown whether CAVV infection is restricted to mosquitoes or if transmission to other hosts, potentially vertebrates, occurs. It is interesting that CoV has not been detected in insects, but that the typical reservoir hosts-bats for alpha-and beta-CoV and birds for gamma-CoV-are largely insect feeding. Common ancestors of CAVV and CoV may thus have been insect borne and have diverged after independent host switches to bats and birds. This is in contrast to earlier proposals suggesting acquisition of gamma-CoV by birds from bats via raptors (57) but in agreement with hypotheses that emphasize CoV phylogeny and ecological considerations (58) . Moreover, it has been suspected from epidemiological observations that a link between ToV and insects may exist (59) . Even though it has not been confirmed that these viruses are carried by insects, the epidemiological implications of insects suggest at least ecologically relevant contact between the virus and its host. An ancestral existence of nidoviruses in arthropods is also supported by the phylogeny of the Nidovirales CAVV included; phylogenetically basal RoV is hosted by crustaceans, which, like mosquitoes, belong to the phylum Arthropoda. An arthropod host at the root of the Nidovirales tree would provide a parsimonious explanation for host associations of several of the known Nidovirales.",

Further investigations are needed to untangle if the higher prevalence of CAVV in human settlements relates to a higher density of hosts (insects or vertebrates) or virus adaption.

Total RNA of isolate CAVV/C79/CI/2004 was extracted with the Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from C6/36 cells at 24 hpi. RNA was separated on a 2% formaldehyde-1.5% agarose gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and hybridized with the CAVV-specific, DIG-labeled probes. RNAs were analyzed by chemiluminescence using 1:10,000 anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase Fab fragments and 1:100 CDP-Star reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).",

Putative functional motifs with similarity to CoV and ToV in the second ORF included an RdRp domain ( 631 Y-V 787 , cd01699), a ZBD ( 1051 C-L 1113 , UPF1, pfam09416,Fig. S1b), and a HEL domain ( 1466 K-I 1717 , superfamily I DNA and RNA helicases, COG1112). Phylogenies of RdRp and HEL domains indicated equidistant basal relationships to CoV and RoV (see below). Furthermore, a putative NendoU was identified. Sequence alignments suggest that the active site of the CAVV NendoU involves residues His 4670 , His 4685 , and Lys 4725",
