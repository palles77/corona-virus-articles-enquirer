Recently, we and another group independently identified several horseshoe bat species (genus Rhinolophus) as the reservoir host for a large number of viruses that have a close genetic relationship with the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Our current research focused on the identification of the reservoir species for the progenitor virus of the SARS coronaviruses responsible for outbreaks during 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 . In addition to SARS-like coronaviruses, many other novel bat coronaviruses, which belong to groups 1 and 2 of the 3 existing coronavirus groups, have been detected by PCR. The discovery of bat SARS-like coronaviruses and the great genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats have shed new light on the origin and transmission of SARS coronaviruses.",

Bats with positive results were detected in the provinces of Hubei and Guangxi, which are >1,000 km apart. A group in Hong Kong (31) found that, when analyzed by PCR, 23 (39%) of 59 anal swabs of wild Chinese horseshoe bats (R. sinicus) contained genetic material closely related to SARS-CoV. They also found that as many as 84% of the horseshoe bats examined contained antibodies to a recombinant N protein of SARS-CoV. A previous study indicated a certain level of antigenic cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and some group 1 coronaviruses (6) and that several group 1 coronaviruses had recently been found in bats. Therefore, the actual seropositive proportion of R. sinicus might be <84%. Nevertheless, the relatively high seroprevalence and wide distribution of seropositive bats is consistent with the serologic pattern expected from a pathogen's natural reservoir host (29) .",

Bats SYNOPSIS have been chosen as the main target because of their species diversity, large population size, broad geographic distribution, ability for long-distance migration, and habit of roosting in large groups. In addition to the SARSlike-CoVs described above, many other coronaviruses have been detected by PCR among diverse bat populations in Hong Kong ( (32) sampled 309 individual bats representing 13 species from 20 different locations in rural Hong Kong. They detected coronavirus-related viral genomic RNA in 37 bats, representing a prevalence of 12%. Partial sequencing of RdRp and helicase genes identified 8 coronavirus genome types, 2 of which were the same as those reported previously (28, 30, 31) . The other 6 novel types of coronaviruses were obtained from 6 different bat species and phylogenetically positioned in 2 of the existing 3 coronavirus groups. Four were in group 1, derived from bat species M. magnater, M. pusillus, Myotis ricketti, and R. sinicus; the other 2 were in group 2, from bat species Pipistrellus abramus and Tylonycteris pachypus. To accommodate the newly discovered genetic diversity of group 2 coronaviruses, the authors proposed the following subdivisions: group 2a (coronaviruses existing before the discovery of SARS-CoV), group 2b (SARS-CoV and SARS-like-CoVs), and group 2c (novel bat coronaviruses discovered in this study).

The most convincing case was the infection of a waitress and a customer in a restaurant where SARS-CoV-positive civets were housed in cages (25) . Two key questions remain: What is the natural reservoir host for the outbreak SARS-CoV strains, and how were the viruses transmitted to civets or other intermediate hosts? Although not conclusive, the data obtained so far strongly suggest that bats (horseshoe bats in particular) are most likely the reservoir host of SARS-CoV. As indicated above, bat coronaviruses seem to be species-specific and SARS-like-CoVs discovered so far are exclusively associated with horseshoe bats. We hope that continued field study will eventually identify the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV among the 69 different known horseshoe species. The facts that the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV seems to be a relatively rare event and that legal and illegal trading of wildlife animals between People's Republic of China and other countries occurs raise the possibility that the natural reservoir species may not be native to People's Republic of China. Thus, we should expand our search into regions other than Hong Kong and mainland People's Republic of China. Another approach to search for the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV is to conduct infection experiments in different bat species. If we assume that the progenitor viruses come from bats, chances are high that the human/civet SARS-CoVs are still capable of infecting the original reservoir species.",

This may also be true for civet-to-human transmission.

Ability to efficiently use the receptor molecules (ACE2 for human and civet) seems to be a major limiting factor for animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission (35) . This also explains why the SARS-CoV was able to cause the human pandemic but the closely related bat SARS-like-CoVs were not. For the SARS-like-CoVs to infect humans, substantial genetic changes in the S1 receptor-binding domain will be necessary. These changes may be achieved in 1 of 2 possible ways. They could be achieved by genetic recombination, as coronaviruses are known to be able to recombine. For example, bat SARS-like-CoVs and another yet unknown coronavirus could coinfect an intermediate host, and the bat viruses would gain the ACE2 binding site in the S1 domain by recombination. The alternative is continuous evolution independent of recombination. Coronaviruses in bats could have a spectrum sufficiently diverse to encompass the progenitor virus for SARS-CoVs. The progenitor virus's ability to bind human ACE2 may be acquired or improved by adaptation (i.e., point mutations) in >1 intermediate host before it could efficiently infect humans. The existence of at least 3 discontinuous highly variable genomic regions between SARS-CoV and SARS-like-CoV indicates that the second mechanism is more likely.",

Although the exact natural reservoir host for the progenitor virus of SARS-CoV is still unknown, we believe that a continued search in different bat populations in People's Republic of China and neighboring countries, combined with experimental infection of different bat species with SARS-CoV, will eventually identify the native reservoir species. A positive outcome of these investigations will greatly enhance our understanding of spillover mechanisms, which will in turn facilitate development and implementation of effective prevention strategies. The discovery of SARS-like-CoVs in bats highlights the increasingly recognized importance of bats as reservoirs of emerging viruses (36) . Moreover, the recent emergence of SARS-CoVs and other bat-associated viruses such as henipaviruses (37, 38) , Menangle, and Tioman viruses (36) , and variants of rabies viruses and bat lyssaviruses (38, 39) also supports the contention that viruses, especially RNA viruses, possess more risk than other pathogens for disease emergence in human and domestic mammals because of their higher mutation rates (40) .",

In a parallel study conducted between January and September 2004 (27), molecular analysis was used to investigate the distribution of SARS-CoV in palm civets in markets and on farms. PCR analysis of samples from 91 palm civets and 15 raccoon dogs in 1 animal market and 1,107 civets from 25 farms in 12 provinces showed positive results for all animals from the market and negative results for all animals from the farms. Similar results were obtained in wild-trapped civets in Hong Kong; none of the 21 wild civets sampled had positive antibody or PCR results for SARS-CoV (28).",
