            "text": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Chinese Herbal Prescription JieZe-1(JZ-1), added and subtracted from Yihuang Decoction, a famous formula in the 12th year of Kangxi in Qing Dynasty, has a clear effect on Genital Herpes (GH) and no obvious adverse reactions occur clinically. JZ-1 also has preventive and therapeutic effects on Trichomonas vaginitis, Candida albicans vaginitis and GH in vitro and in vivo experiments. Aim of study: The effect and mechanism of JZ-1 on anti-herpes simplex virus type 2(HSV-2) in vitro focusing on adhesion and penetration stages were investigated. Materials and methods: A model of HSV-2 infection of VK2/E6E7 was developed. In order to explore JZ-1's anti-HSV-2 effect in vitro, cell morphology, ultrastructural pathology, cell viability and expression of viral glycoprotein D (gD) were assessed at 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h of JZ-1 treatment. Then we measured the exact time required for adhesion and penetration of HSV-2 into VK2/E6E7 among a series of times at room temperature and under temperature control techniques. We treated VK2/E6E7 with JZ-1, penciclovir, or berberine and explored the mechanism of JZ-1 in blocking HSV-2 adhesion and penetration of host cells by assessing the cell ultrastructural pathology, viability, viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, ICP5, and ICP4 and host cell proteins HVEM, Nectin-1, and Nectin-2. Results: HSV-2 can fully adhere and penetrate into VK/E6E7 within 5 mins at room temperature while it takes 60mins under temperature control techniques. JZ-1 and penciclovir showed significant anti-HSV-2 effects, with improved host cell morphologies and increased host cell viabilities observed after treatment for 24 h. The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 can be detected after treatment for 6 h while that of penciclovir was not obvious until treatment for 12 h. JZ-1 showed distinct effect on HSV-2 adhesion and penetration stages by significantly reducing the expression of viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, ICP5, and ICP4, improving cell morphology and increasing cell viability. However, these effects were not exerted via downregulated expression of membrane fusion-related proteins such as HVEM, Nectin-1, or Nectin-2. The specific anti-HSV-2 mechanism of JZ-1 need to be further explored. Conclusion: The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 was superior to that of penciclovir and berberine in vitro, and was mainly mediated by enhancing host cell defense and blocking adhesion and penetration of HSV-2.",

More than 500 million people worldwide are infected with GH, and 20-23 million new infections are reported each year according to WHO (Kesharwani et al., 2017) . As a member of the herpesvirus family, HSV-2 is the primary causative agent of GH (Mousavi et al., 2017) . HSV-2 is a giant dsDNA virus belonging to the \u03b1-herpesvirus subfamily, which is mainly transmitted to genital mucosa through sexual behavior. HSV-2 causes genital herpes or ulcers during acute infection (Kesharwani et al., 2017, p. 2) , and can migrate to cranial ganglia resulting in lifelong latent infection pregnancy can also cause neonatal encephalitis through placental transmission, resulting in high morbidity and mortality (Vilhelmova-Ilieva et al., 2014) . Epidemiological studies have shown that HSV-2 can act as an important synergistic factor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (Nikolic and Piguet, 2010) , and increase the risk of HIV-1 infection by 2-3-fold (Mohraz et al., 2018) . The prevention and treatment of GH has always been an urgent problem to be solved.",

            "text": "HSV-2 infection is a sequential process involving the interaction of multiple viral proteins with host cell molecules. Among more than ten glycosylated proteins in the viral envelope, only five glycoproteins (gB, gC, gD, and heterodimeric gH/gL) play an essential role in membrane fusion (Sep\u00falveda-Crespo et al., 2017) . After contacting between HSV-2 and host cells, gD binds to specific receptors (HVEM, Nectin-1, Nectin-2, or 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate) and sequentially recruits gB and gH/ gL heterodimers. It results in activation of gH/gL heterodimers, which in turn upregulates the fusion activity of gB, allowing it to be inserted directly into cell membranes through its internal fusion loop to anchor virions to host cells (Luo et al., 2015a) . Virions approach the nucleus along intracellular actin and microtubule filaments after entering the cell, and the capsids are stripped at nuclear pores to release viral dsDNA into the nucleus (Nozawa et al., 2004) . After the viral genome entering the nucleus, the viral tegument protein VP16 interacts with the host cell transcription factor Oct-1, activating the host cell RNA polymerase complex (Kato et al., 2000) which in turn mediates immediate early viral gene transcription and expression of the immediate early proteins (Akhrameyeva et al., 2011) . Expression of immediate early genes including R L 2, R S 1, U L 54, U S 1, and U S 12, which are in turn translated to ICP0, ICP4, ICP27, ICP22, and ICP47, generally peaks around 2-4 h after infection (Halford et al., 2001) . The immediate early proteins are the primary activators of early viral genes, and their transcription products are required for viral replication (Smith and Schaffer, 1987) . Expression of early genes, such as the viral DNA polymerase, ssDNAbinding protein ICP8, and viral thymidine kinase, peaks around 5-7 h after infection (Costa et al., 1997) . Expression of late gene transcripts include viral structural proteins such as gB, gC, gD, gK, VP16, VP5, and vhs peaks around 12-15 h after infection (Sampath and Deluca, 2008) . The nucleocapsid is comprised of mature structural proteins and forms an envelope surrounding viral DNA to enable exit from the nucleus. Then nucleocapsid is further processed in the cytoplasm to form progeny virions that are released into the extracellular space (Desai and Kulkarni, 2015) . Based on the basic biology of HSV-2 infection, anti-HSV-2 drugs can inhibit different targets. Most commonly-used anti-HSV-2 drugs act at the viral gene replication stage and have single action site. These drugs easily elicit resistance (Hopkins et al., 2018) , and have little impact on latent and recurrent viral infection (Akhrameyeva et al., 2011) . Therefore, the development of drugs acting at the adhesion, penetration, release, and intercellular infection stages of HSV-2 has become an important research goal.",

            "text": "The antiviral effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been confirmed by clinical practice. It plays a vital role in the treatment of epidemic infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and influenza A virus H1N1 (Ge et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2005) . The anti-HSV-1 and anti-HSV-2 effects of TCM have also been verified in vitro and in vivo experiments Xiong et al., 2011) . GH belongs to the categories of \"leukorrheagial diseases\" and \"erosion of vulva\", which was firstly recorded in \"A Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies\" written by Ge Hong in the Eastern Jin Dynasty (Ge, 2016) . There are many different TCM names of GH in later books such as \"Renzhai Zhizhi Fanglun\" and \"Medical Prescription\", but there is no uniform standard yet. \"Pudendal heat sore\" is oftenly cited by most doctors as the TCM diagnosis of GH (Feng and Zhu, 2015) . Symptoms of GH include vulvar erosion, ulcers, and searing pain. Disease pathogenesis begins with exogenous wind-heat toxin caused by insanitary or excessive sexual intercourse and the downward flow of dampness-heat in the liver channel. The disease is long-lasting and lingering. General therapies involve internal therapy and external therapy, acupuncture therapy is also recorded (Zhang and Li, 2012) . Internal therapy strategies involve coursing wind and dissipating heat, clearing away toxins and removing dampness, calming liver and strengthening spleen, tonifying yin and replenishing the kidney with the oral preparation such as Wu Lin Decoction, Gentianae Decoction for Purging Liver-Fire, Zhibai Dihuang pill and so on (Feng and Zhu, 2015; Zhang and Li, 2012) . External therapy strategies involve clearing away heat and toxins, removing dampness and relieving itching, curing leucorrhagia and ulcer with external application of Chinese herbs or Chinese medicine compounds. The treatment strategies was adjusted at different stages of the disease. The treatment at early stage of GH is to eliminate pathogenic factors. When healing is delayed, the treatment is to both strengthen body resistance and eliminate evil. During the incubation period or repeated attacks of GH, the main treatment is to strengthen healthy energy. On the basis of the ancient prescription Yihuang Decoction, a classic prescription of \"Fu Qingzhu's Obstetrics and Gynecology\" in Qing dynasty of CHINA (Jing, 2012; LI et al., 2017; Liu, 2010; Xin and Tan, 2016) , and combined with the modern research results of Chinese herbal medicine, JZ-1 is an in-hospital preparation of Tongji Hospital ( , and Borneolum Syntheticum. It is mainly used to treat wet turbid zones, vulvar redness and swelling, ulcers, and other diseases such as female lower reproductive tract infection, with the effect of clearing away heat and toxins, removing dampness, curing leucorrhagia, treating ulcer, strengthening justice, and dispelling evil (Chen et al., 2009a) . Clinical data showed that JZ-1 has an excellent therapeutic effect in leucorrhagia, vulva redness, and ulcer. Experimental studies in vitro and in vivo showed that JZ-1 has preventive and therapeutic effects on Trichomonas vaginitis, Candida albicans vaginitis, and GH, while it had little effect on vaginal lactic acid bacteria (Chen et al., 2009b (Chen et al., , 2009d (Chen et al., , 2009e, 2009c Hong et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2011; Ping et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2013) .",

Journal of Ethnopharmacology 249 (2020) 112405 a hot spot in the development of new antiviral drugs (Kesharwani et al., 2017; Yildirim et al., 2016) . \"Fu Qingzhu's Obstetrics and Gynecology\" was written by Fu Shan, a famous Chinese medical scientist, in the 12th year of Kangxi in Qing Dynasty (1673). It is an authoritative monograph of obstetrics and gynecology with great clinical value (Qian, 2009; Zhu et al., 2015) . Fu Shan emphasized the theory of viscera (Zangfu), Qi and blood, channels and collaterals. He paid attention to the dialectics of the liver, spleen, and kidney, tonifing the qi and blood of women, and dispelling evil by strengthening justice. His medication is precise and close to the clinic, and the prescription he created is still in use today (Zhang and Zhang, 1987) . Yihuang Decoction is one of the most classical prescriptions in \"Fu Qingzhu's Obstetrics and Gynecology\". It is composed of P. chinense Schneid., G. biloba L., Dioscorea opposita Thunb. (Dioscoreae Rhizoma), Plantago asiatica L. (Plantaginis Semen), and Euryale ferox Salisb. (Euryales Semen) with the effect of clearing heat and dehumidifying, tonifying the kidney, and arresting leukorrhagia (Jing, 2012; Liu, 2010) . Yihuang Decoction has a remarkable clinical effect on pelvic inflammation, cervicitis, and vaginitis according to clinical study Xin and Tan, 2016) . In JZ-1 recipe, P. chinense Schneid., bitter in flavor, cold in property, acting on the kidney and urinary bladder channels with the effects of clearing away heat, removing dampness, purging fire, and detoxication, especially be good at clearing away dampness and heat in lower warmer(the term, Sanjiao, is peculiar to TCM). The therapeutic effects of P. chinense Schneid. including antiinflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial, hypotensive, antiarrhythmic, and antipyretic agents have been confirmed by modern pharmacological studies (Sun et al., 2019) . P. chinense Schneid. can exert its anti-inflammatory effect by down-regulating the release of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) (Cu\u00e9llar et al., 2001) . G. biloba L., bitter, sweet, and pucker in flavor, natured in property, acting on the kidney and lung channels with the effect of inducing astringency, removing dampness, and curing leukorrhagia, mainly treating turbid dampness and leukorrhagia. Many experimental and clinical studies have approved the therapeutic effects of G. biloba L. including DNA repair, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, photoprotective, and anti-inflammatory activities (Mohanta and Zubaidha, 2014) . The extracts of G. biloba L. could significantly decrease the release of VCAM-1 induced by TNF-\u03b1 by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway (Piazza et al., 2019) . P. chinense Schneid. and G. biloba L. are both used as monarch drugs (originated from Yihuang Decoction). S. nigrum L., bitter and sweet in flavor, slightly cold in property, acting on the lung and urinary bladder channels with the effects of clearing away heat, removing toxicity, detumescence, and relieving itching, mainly treating carbuncle, eczema, and dermatitis. S. nigrum L. is wildly used in TCM for the treatment of a wide range of diseases including some eye infections, seizure, epilepsy, inflammation, pain, diarrhea, ulcer, and jaundice (Campisi et al., 2019) . T. mongolicum Hand.-Mazz, bitter and sweet in flavor, cold in property, acting on the liver and stomach channels with the effects of clearing away heat, removing toxicity, reducing swelling, and dissipating mass. T. mongolicum Hand.-Mazz has the effects of antivirus, antibacterial, anti-inflammation, and enhancing immunity according to modern pharmacological studies (Jiang et al., 2017; Ling and Zheng, 1998) . In vitro experiments have shown that T. mongolicum Hand.-Mazz could influence certain inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, COX-2, IL-1, iNOS) in leukocytes, astrocytes, and macrophages (Gonz\u00e1lez-Castej\u00f3n et al., 2012) . T. arvense Linn., bitter and acrid in flavor, cold in property, acting on the liver, stomach, and large intestine channels with the effects of relieving heat and detoxification, dispelling silt, and purulence. It has been reportedly used for the management of several diseases including abscess of lung, dysentery, enteritis, intestines carbuncle, conjunctivitis, constipation, hepatitis, bellyache, postpartum blood stasis, furuncle, and swollen. T. arvense Linn. could decrease the infiltration of inflammatory cells and expression of cytokines in upper genital tract of multipathogen-infected rats (Zou et al., 2015) . S. nigrum L., T. mongolicum Hand.-Mazz, and T. arvense Linn. are used as minister drugs. S. glabra Roxb., sweet in flavor and natured in property, acting on the liver and stomach channels with the effects of dehumidification, detoxication, and easing joint movement. It is testified in clinic treatment that it can cure syphilitic poisoned sores, morbid leucorrhea, carbuncle toxin, limb hypertonicity, strangury due to heat, eczema pruritus, and many other human ailments (Hua et al., 2018) . The extracts of S. glabra Roxb. showed immunomodulatory potential by activating macrophages and enhancing host immunity, which makes it a novel immunomodulator for application in immunological diseases . D. dasycarpus Turcz., bitter in flavor, cold in property, acting on the spleen and stomach channels with the effects of clearing heat and drying dampness, dispelling wind and detoxication. It has been wildly used in TCM for the treatment of rheumatism, itching, bleeding, chronic hepatitis, jaundice, and skin diseases (Lv et al., 2015) . P. suffruticosa Andr., bitter and acrid in flavor, slightly cold in property, acting on the heart, liver, and kidney channels with the effects of clearing heat and cooling blood, promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. It is clinically used to treat gynecological diseases like endometriosis, breast hyperplasia, and uterine fibroids. It can also be used to treat digestive diseases like acute pancreatitis, ulcerative colitis, and cholecystitis . S. glabra Roxb., D. dasycarpus Turcz., and P. suffruticosa Andr. are used to clear heat, remove toxicity, eliminate carbuncle, remove dampness, relieve itching, and treat ulcer as assistant drugs. These ingredients and guiding drugs with the functions of clearing and detoxification, aczoiling, relieving itching, and inducing resuscitation are worked together to clear away heat and toxins, remove dampness, cure leucorrhagia, and treat ulcer.",

Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of gD expression showed that only JZ-1 had an antiviral effect at the treatment of 6 h. Since the late gene transcription products of HSV-2, including gB, gC, gD, gE, gG, and other viral structural proteins, are produced significantly 12-15 h after infection (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2018; Su et al., 2017) , the gD observed in host cells at 6 h of infection was mostly derived from the original virons that infected the cells, suggesting that JZ-1 plays a vital role in the early Fig. 5 .

In HSV-2 penetration group,VK2/E6E7 were precooled at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, then pre-cooled HSV-2 solution was applied at 4\u00b0C for 3 h to allow virions to adhere to host cells. The cells were washed twice gently with Hank's buffered saline solution before applying a 1:1 vol mixture of HSV-2 solution and drugs (or medium) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h to allow virions to penetrate into host cells.

Q. Duan, et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 249 (2020) 112405 stages of viral infection. Both penciclovir and JZ-1 showed apparent antiviral effects at the treatment of 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h according to immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of gD expression, suggesting that with the extension time of HSV-2 infection, penciclovir, which acts on the replication stage of HSV-2, shows antiviral efficacy. Morphological observations and analysis of cell survival after 24 h of infection showed that cell survival rate and cell morphology (including refractive index, cell adherent state, intercellular space, and intercellular junctions) in the JZ-1 and penciclovir groups were superior to those of HSV-2 alone group. Morphological observation and virions count by TEM confirmed the anti-HSV-2 effects of JZ-1 and penciclovir in vitro. Cells in the HSV-2 alone group became significantly rounded and showed evidence of nucleus pyknosis, chromatin concentration, mitochondrial swelling, endoplasmic reticulum expansion, and other organelle damage. The morphology of cells in JZ-1 and penciclovir groups was similar to the control group, suggesting that JZ-1 can not only improve cell survival but also maintain the normal function of cells by protecting their organelles. As a nucleoside antiviral drug, the anti-HSV-2 mechanism of penciclovir is competitive inhibition of the HSV-2 polymerase, thus selectively inhibiting synthesis and replication of viral DNA (Kesharwani et al., 2017) . The antiviral effect of JZ-1 was superior to penciclovir at the treatment of 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h, indicating that the antiviral effect of JZ-1 is not only exerted in the early stage of infection, but also might in the replication stage. Adhesion and penetration of HSV-2 into host cells are sequential processes, HSV-2 can fully adhere and penetrate into host cells rapidly at room temperature (Tao, 2010) , but the exact time required for these steps has not been reported yet. Firstly, we explored the time required for HSV-2 adhesion and penetration of VK2/E6E7 at room temperature in detail. Result showed that HSV-2 could completely adhere and penetrate into host cells within 5 mins at room temperature which was too short to distinguish, and drug treatments are difficult to complete within 5 mins. Since temperature can impact viral infection, we chose to use temperature control technology to delay the process of HSV-2 adhesion and penetration (Tao, 2010) , hopefully allowing us to distinguish individual stages of the viral life cycle.",

This way, HSV-2 adhesion to VK2/E6E7 was successfully modeled.

The result of Western blot showed that expression of gD in the virus adhesion group was significantly higher than the control group using temperature control techniques, while there was no significant expression of the immediate early protein ICP4. Thus, we could exclude the possibility that virions had entered the nucleus to begin the replication cycle, ensuring that most of the virions remained at the stage of adhesion. Cell survival in the virus adhesion group was only about 50% of the control group at 24 h after temperature control treatment, indicating that even if the free virons are washed off, there were still enough virions attached to cell membrane to infect host cells and reduce their survival using temperature control technology.

            "text": "To further explore the antagonistic effect and mechanism of JZ-1 on HSV-2 adhesion and penetration, we assessed the expression of viral envelope proteins, viral tegument protein, viral capsid protein, viral replication phase protein, and host cell receptors at the HSV-2 adhesion and penetration stages by western blot. The results showed that expression of viral envelope proteins gD and gB, viral tegument protein VP16, and viral capsid protein ICP5 in the JZ-1 group were significantly lower than the HSV-2 adhesion and penetration groups. Binding of gB to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) on the surface of host cells can shorten the distance between HSV-2 and cells to initiate the adhesion of virus to host cells (Luo et al., 2015b) . Binding of gD to HVEM, Nectin-1, and Nectin-2 can induce the fusion of virus envelope and cell membrane (Liu et al., 2016a) . gB and gD are essential for mediating the infection of HSV-2 to host cells (Fujimoto et al., 2019) . Our results demonstrated that JZ-1 could effectively inhibit adhesion and penetration of virions into host cells by down-regulating the expression of viral envelope proteins and then reduce its binding to cell receptors. As a late gene transcripts, HSV-2 tegument protein VP16 is not only the key factor of HSV-2 lytic mode infection but also critical for the virus to be reactivated from its latent state . The reduction of VP16 expression indicates that JZ-1 can not only anti-HSV-2 infection of VK2/E6E7, but also interfere with HSV-2 intracellular replication and reinfection by inhibiting the expression of replication gene mediated by VP16 and reducing the activation of latent virus. As an immediate early protein, which is required for viral replication, ICP4 is transcribed by immediate early genes, and its expression shows entry of HSV-2 into the replication cycle . There was no significant expression of ICP4 in each group, since the virons only remained at the adhesion and penetration stages and had not yet undergone replication. After binding of the viral envelope protein gD to the host cell membrane receptor, the polypeptide chain structure and protein conformations changes to induce the fusion of the virus and the Q. Duan, et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 249 (2020) 112405 cell membrane, which in turn leads to the penetration of virions into host cells (Liu et al., 2016b) . There was no significant difference in the expression of the host cell receptors HVEM, Nectin-1, and Nectin-2 between the control group, the virus infection group and the treatment group, suggesting that viral infection and drug treatments did not alter the expression level of host cell receptors. Whether the inhibitory effect of JZ-1 on viral adhesion and penetration is exerted by changing the conformations of these receptors is worthy of further study. Expression of downstream proteins and terminal effector molecules after fusion of HSV-2 with cell membranes can also be further assessed to study the mechanism of the anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 (Bright et al., 2012) . At the same time, infection of HSV-2 to host cells are cross-regulated by multiple molecules and pathways. JZ-1 can exert its antiviral effect through a variety of signal transduction mechanisms, which needs to be further explored. At present, the host cells mostly used to establish HSV-2 in vitro model are Vero, HeLa, and VK2/E6E7 et al. (Akhrameyeva et al., 2011; Davis et al., 1978; Yao and Rosenthal, 2011) . Since the primary culture technology of human vaginal epithelial cells cannot meet the needs of in vitro research, it is a better choice using VK2/E6E7 as host cells to study the mechanism of HSV-2 infection.",

Using alone of berberine in our experiment showed no noticeable anti-HSV-2 effect whether in the early or late stages. But the antiviral effect of berberine might be exerted by interacting with other components of JZ-1, which needs to be further explored by observing the interaction of metabolites that could interfere with viral cycle. The results of in vitro experiments showed that the efficacy of berberine was not the equivalent of JZ-1 compound preparation, which also reflected the scientificity of the combination of monarch, minister, assistant, and guide drugs in TCM prescription.",
