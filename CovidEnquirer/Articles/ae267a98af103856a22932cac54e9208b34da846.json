It briefly reviews coevolution of hosts and parasites, principal elements of virus-host interactions, existing resistance mechanisms, and conventional methods for improvement of disease resistance. Research results from genetic engineering of new resistance mechanisms in both plants and animals, as well as investigation of possible risks and 'biological cost' of such mechanisms are summarized as a background for the discussion of prerequisites and strategies for future genetic engineering of resistance to viruses in livestock. It is concluded that, while conventional breeding methods will remain the principal approach to the improvement of disease resistance, in some instances the introduction of new, genetically engineered resistance mechanisms may be justified. livestock / virus / resistance mechanism / genetic engineering R\u00e9sum\u00e9 -R\u00e9sistance des animaux de ferme aux virus: m\u00e9canismes et strat\u00e9gies de g\u00e9nie g\u00e9n\u00e9tique.

            "text": "The use of livestock for food, fibre and draft over hundreds of years has led to a significant influence by humans on the evolution of domesticated animal species. Some of the changes induced by artificial selection parallel in their significance speciation. A modern meat-type chicken can be viewed as a species different from a modern egg-type chicken. Similar differences exist between breeds of dairy and beef cattle. This 'genetic engineering' of livestock was achieved through the long-term use of conventional genetic improvement methods. It can be argued that gene transfer represents just another phase in the development of genetic engineering of livestock and that it would be foolish not to take advantage of the new technologies. Thus introduction of new mechanisms of disease resistance in livestock by gene transfer may be viewed as a logical continuation of the creative influence of humans on the evolution of farm animals and birds that could benefit mankind by improvements in food safety and production efficiency. Increased disease resistance will also improve the welfare of livestock. The latter consequence may make this type of genetic engineering more acceptable to the general public than other types of gene transfer. If there is one attribute that is common to viruses, it is the lack of uniformity in all aspects of their existence. Nevertheless, this review attempts to find general elements and common patterns in the subject discussed. As background for the discussion of the subject, the article deals briefly with coevolution of hosts and parasites and principal elements of virus-host interactions, and reviews past improvement of disease resistance in plants and livestock by conventional breeding and genetic engineering, as well as the potential 'biological cost' of genetic manipulation. It includes prerequisites for and principles of the design of new resistance mechanisms, and proposes possible strategies for the introduction of disease resistance mechanisms by gene transfer.",

Nevertheless, the virus always retains its origin of replication. Recombination has also a large role in viral evolution because it allowed viruses to 'try out new gene combinations'. An example of an unusual acquisition of genes by a virus are three tRNA genes in bacteriophage T4a type of gene only observed in eukaryotes (Gott et al, 1986) . Although it is possible that the genes evolved within T4, the phage may also have acquired the genes from an eukaryotic host (Michel and Dujon, 1986) . Similarly some retroviruses such as Rous sarcoma virus acquired oncogenes for their genome.",

For example, LDL and the human minor rhinovirus compete for LDL receptors (table I) , and cells with down-regulated LDL receptor expression yield much less virus than up-regulated cells (Hofer et al, 1994) . Viruses tend to use abundant molecules as receptors, so that reduction in availability of the molecules for the physiological function is not lethal, or molecules whose function can be substituted by other molecules. There are alternative viral strategies to deal with the receptor problem. The part of the sodium-independent transporter of cationic amino acids, used as the receptor for ecotropic bovine leukemia virus (table I), is different from the part of the protein directly involved in the amino-acid transport function. Thus the physiological function of the receptor can continue, despite binding of virus to the receptor (Wang et al, 1994) . Another example confirming this possibility is the sodium-dependent transporter of inorganic phosphate that serves as the receptor for the gibbon ape leukemia virus (table I). Productive infection of cells expressing this receptor results in complete blockage of the uptake of inorganic phosphate mediated by the receptor. Nevertheless, the infection is not cytotoxic. Hence, there is likely more than one phosphate transport mechanism in these cells (Olah et al, 1994) . This aspect of viral strategies may open up possibilities to block the receptor sites, thus preventing entry of a virus without serious impairment of physiological function of the receptor.",

The viral receptor heparan sulfate is present on cell surfaces but body fluids also contain heparin and heparin-binding proteins, either of which can prevent binding of herpes simplex virus to cells (Spear et al, 1992) . Hence spread of the virus is likely influenced by both immune response and the probability that the virus will be entrapped and inhibited from binding to cells by extracellular forms of the receptor (heparin or heparan sulfate). Similarly, soluble molecules of the CD4 receptor for human immunodeficiency virus, as well as fragments of the critical CD4 domains can inhibit infection . It has been suggested that a secreted receptor for avian leukosis virus might similarly be able to neutralize the virus (Bates et al, 1993) .",

Non-enveloped viruses penetrate host cells by the first two processes. Uncoating of the virus particle takes place after penetration. For some viruses, such as orthomyxoviruses and picorna viruses, divestiture of the protective envelope or capsid takes place upon their entry into cells. For others, such as herpes viruses, the capsid is transported along the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton into nuclear pores. With reoviruses, only a portion of the capsid is removed and the viral genome expresses all its functions even though it is never fully released from the capsid. While several genetic engineering strategies to prevent attachment of viruses to host cells can be devised and are proposed below, strategies to prevent penetration of viruses attached to cells are much less obvious.",

Viruses that persist in the body may cause damage, and prevention of persistence may be the next best defence if prevention of virus entry is impossible. Persistence is usually in differentiated cells that remain morphologically unchanged but may lose their differentiated or 'luxury' function, as well as their homeostasis. Persistent viruses can negatively influence host cells in two ways: (1) virus presence and replication causes damage resulting in a selective disadvantage; and (2) in such a way that the virus will gain an evolutionary advantage for which there will be selection pressure to maintain. Alternatively, some viruses undergo a latency stage in their life cycle that seems to cause little damage. Enveloped viruses move from infected cells either by budding through the plasma membrane or by secretion vesicles containing virus particles within the plasma membrane (Knipe, 1991) .

Virus infection can lead to development of immune responses against the host's own tissues and viruses can also code for proteins, homologous to cellular proteins, that modify the host's immune response. For example, Epstein-Barr virus produces a BCRF1 protein similar to the interleukin IL-10 protein (a cytokine-inhibiting factor) that inhibits the production of IL-2 and IL-3, tumor necrosis factor, gamma interferon, and macrophage-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) but not HSV-2 can interfere with the complement system by producing a protein that acts as a receptor for the component of the complement cascade. Virus infections can also interfere directly with the major histocompatibility system (MHC). Cytomegalovirus encodes an MHC class I heavy-chain homolog that limits expression of the cellular class I molecules on cell surfaces and this may reduce killing of infected cells by host defences.",

However, the nature of nonhost resistance is not sufficiently understood to fully explore the incompatibility between viruses and non-hosts (Wilson, 1993) . Nevertheless, it is certain that we, as well as all animals, are &dquo;continuously bathed in a sea of microbes, yet harmed by a relatively few&dquo; (Oldstone, 1993) . To coexist, viruses and their hosts have established, to a greater or lesser degree, an equilibrium. In general, normal coevolution of parasites and their hosts is from disoperation, through exploitation, to toleration and from facultative to obligatory mutualism, but genetic changes may also bring reversals to this process (Dobzhansky, 1959) . None of the strategies for the creation of new, genetically engineered viral resistance mechanisms proposed in this article are derived from non-host resistance. Nevertheless, a brief discussion of the subject is included to stimulate further exploration of this widespread phenomenon as the possible basis for protection of livestock against viruses. Some knowledge of non-host resistance mechanisms is emerging from experimentation with plant viruses that infect permissible but normally resistant cells by bypassing the resistance barrier (Dawson and Hilf, 1992) . Viral host range is determined by interactions between existing viral gene products and corresponding host components. Because of the obligately parasitic nature of viruses, viral host range is not determined by a particular gene product that enables the virus to overcome host defences but by a 'fit' between viral gene product and certain gene products of the host. There are two general prerequisites for successful infection: (1) Presence of all conditions necessary for viral infection. Absence of the conditions results in 'passive resistance mechanisms' in plants, that tend to be recessive or incompletely dominant. (2) Absence of successful host defences. Adaptation mechanisms of viruses that enable them to infect potential hosts protected by non-host mechanisms may include an ability to overcome a host block by a mutation or recombination with another virus, or acquisition by the virus of capabilities formerly provided by the hosts that are not available in resistant plants. A virus can capture such genetic information from the host.",

The ALV receptors, which belong to the family of receptors for LDL (Bates et al, 1993) , include recessive alleles that do not allow viral entry into potential host cells and render some chickens resistant to the virus.

Only the cell-mediated immune response that is especially effective against cells containing actively replicating virus and, as a rule, is the most important defence against viral infections will be discussed briefly. The cellular immune system becomes sensitized to viral infection only after viral proteins are degraded to short linear peptide epitopes that become complexed with class I or II major histocompatibility complex proteins. The resulting complexes are transported to cell surface, where they are presented as 'non-self' entities to T-lymphocytes. If the viral antigen has not previously encountered the T-cell repertoire of the host, the initial antigen-specific activation event requires appearance of MHC-peptide complexes on antigen-presenting cells. But if activated T-cells, previously sensitized to the viral epitopes are available, then a broader class of antigen-presenting cells can be targeted for clearance by cytotoxic T cells. In both events, the ability to discriminate self molecules from the viral epitopes depends on the presentation of the non-self peptide to T-cells in specific peptide-binding grooves of the MHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells.",

It seems that many viral gene products remain to be identified among the open reading frames of as yet unknown function that exists in these viruses.

In the genomes of chickens, there are several families of retrovirus-related permanent insertions.

The presence of some of these proviruses may interfere in the spread of the generally non-pathogenic endogenous virus produced by other such proviruses. However, the endogenous proviruses do not protect the host against infection with similar but more harmful, pathogenic exogenous viruses. On the contrary, the antigenic similarity between the products of the endogenous proviruses and the exogenous viral antigens reduces the ability of birds with certain types of these proviruses to mount an immune response against the exogenous virus (Crittenden et al, 1984; Gavora et al, 1995b) .

Recent developments in gene mapping provide good prospects for progress in this direction. Indirect selection for resistance to the herpesvirus of Marek's disease in chickens, by increasing the frequency of the 'resistant' major histocompatibility haplotypes, is one example of such a technique. It has been practised by most of the world's poultry breeding companies over the past two decades (Gavora, 1990 ). Conventional procedures for direct and indirect selection for disease resistance will in the foreseeable future be the main route for genetic improvement of disease resistance. One disadvantage of their application is the general absence, with rare exceptions mentioned above, of genetic variation in resistance to infection. Thus genetic improvements in disease resistance by conventional means lead mostly to better resistance of livestock to disease developmenta situation where the organism becomes infected but tolerates the pathogen and reduces its ill effects.",

Therefore, Wilson (1993) suggests that any unregulated superimposition of protein or nucleic acid species interacting with the virus can result in plants in an apparently virusresistant phenotype. The results from experimentation with animal cells into which a viral gene was inserted indicate that a similar situation may also exist in animals (Gavora et al, 1994) .",

There are several approaches to the introduction of disease resistance by gene transfer in plants (Fitchen and Beachy, 1993) . They include transfers of segments of viral genome encoding capsid or coat proteins, viral sequences encoding proteins that may be subunits of viral replicase, sequences incapable of encoding proteins, entire genomes of defective, interfering viruses, and complete genomes of mild virus strains. The transgenes may act on initiation of infection, replication of virus, spread of infection throughout the plant, and symptom development. The level of protection derived from the transgene ranges from low to high and its breadth of host range from broad to narrow. The available data are not sufficient to firmly establish the molecular mechanisms of the protection.

Fichten and Beachy (1993) list 19 published examples of this approach. It is unlikely that a single mechanism accounts for the observed resistance of the transgenic plants but regardless of the mode of the transgene action, resistance results from a block in an early event in the infection process (Fichten and Beachy, 1993) . In resistance to some viruses other than tobacco mosaic, it seems that accumulation of the coat protein transgene RNA, rather than the virus coat protein itself is responsible for resistance. Resistance has been observed even in plants that transcribed a translation-incompetent coat protein mRNA (Kawchuk et al, 1991; De Haan et al, 1992) . It seems that even in the absence of understanding of its mechanism, the strategy can be extended to other plant species and viruses. Protection by sequences encoding replicase-related proteins Replicase-mediated resistance was first demonstrated against tobacco mosaic virus (Golemboski et al, 1990 ). The number of initially infected cells in transgenic and non-transgenic plants was the same but virus replication was markedly reduced in cells of the transgenic plants. Replication of the virus was severely impeded and little or no systemic spread of the virus occurred (Carr and Zaitlin, 1991) .",

To block viral integration, antisense sequences can be designed to target regions essential in the synthesis of viral DNA intermediates or viral integration. Replication of a recombinant avian retrovirus, carrying a neomycin resistance gene neo' in the antisense orientation was blocked when cells expressed high levels of neo' RNA molecules in the sense orientation, suggesting that antisense RNA inhibition may be a useful strategy for inhibition of retroviral infections . It was hypothesized that when sequences immediately upstream of the polypurine tract are hybridized to antisense molecules, RNase H failed to process the RNA sequences in the polypurine tract into a functional primer for the synthesis of plus-strand DNA (To and Neiman, 1992) .",

They studied lines of transgenic tobacco containing a cowpea trypsin inhibitor gene construct which expressed the transgene at various levels and plants that possessed, but did not express, the gene. Small, but in some instances, significant differences between the transgenic and non-transformed plants were found in various parameters but there was no additional difference between plants that expressed the transgene and those that did not.

It was suggested that the reduced ovulation rate was due to interference of the viral envelope protein produced by the transgene with the attachment of the virus to host cells and also with transport of lipids into the developing egg yolk, since the virus uses an LDL receptor for entry into host cells (Bates et al, 1993) . On the other hand, a transgene containing a gene for a capsid protein of bovine rotavirus in laboratory mice (Gavora et al, 1994) was not associated with any significant effects on their growth and reproductive performance (J Nagai and JS Gavora, unpublished results). Hence, significant 'biological costs' may not always accompany insertion of transgenes but they need to be considered in strategies for genetic engineering of new resistance mechanisms. Reports on work on assessment of risks involved in the production of varieties with new, genetically engineered resistance are only available for plants. Transgenic plants expressing viral pathogen-derived DNA sequences have been considered sites for hyperevolution of viruses through recombination of a mild or defective viral genome with the transgene (De Zoetten, 1991) . However, there is no experimental evidence to confirm this supposition. On the contrary, evidence against this type of event exists through one to up to eight viral passages, even though heteroincapsidation of viral RNA by transgenically expressed viral coat proteins has been observed (Wilson, 1993) .",

They provide evidence that genomic recombination was observed when transgenic tobacco plants expressing a segment of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus genomic RNA were inoculated with a mutant of the same virus that contained a deletion (Greene and Allison, 1994) . The important question is whether such recombination can produce dangerous new viruses. RNA-RNA recombination has indeed been demonstrated for four groups of RNA plant viruses. The recombination occurs between closely related RNA molecules, possibly at sites of similar RNA structure. Under usual crop production circumstances, opportunities exist for genetic interaction between plant viruses in mixed virus infections. Since both crop plants and weeds may be present in a field, recombinations between a virus that cannot infect a plant and one that can, do not have a zero probability. Nevertheless, mixed infections rarely result in new plant pathogenic viruses. Instead, new viral diseases are usually due to minor variants of already known viruses. Generally, however, existing viruses are stable, having to fit hosts that evolve only slowly. Falk and Bruening (1994) believe it is unlikely that recombinations between transgene RNA and viral genomic RNA will occur at greater frequencies than the recombinations already occurring between virus genomic RNAs in natural infections.",

Unlike most of the mechanisms of defence of the hosts against viruses that resulted in virus tolerance by the host, the ideal goal of the new, engineered mechanisms should be prevention of viral entry into host cells. It may be easier to develop new resistance strategies for viruses which depend for most of their functions on the host cell than for those that provide for the functions in their genome. New techniques of molecular and cell biology allow transfers of genes between species, taxonomic genera and even kingdoms so that we are no longer limited by the constraints of sexual compatibility.",

In the case of gene constructs designed to induce new resistance mechanisms, the insertion will likely be targeted into a 'neutral' region of the genome, to minimize the potential disruption of important genomic functions. After successful insertion, it will be possible to test the transformed embryonic stem cells in culture for the expression of the transgene, its stability and, as much as possible, its undesirable effects on the cells. Preliminary testing in cell culture for resistance to the pathogen in question will be also possible. Only the embryonic cell lines that will meet criteria of acceptability in the above tests will be used for the introduction into developing embryos with the goal of producing disease resistant transgenic individuals. It is anticipated that the protocol will make the introduction of new disease resistance mechanisms into livestock less expensive. The approach will also be less risky as the dangers of disruption of important genetic mechanisms by the transgene insertion will be reduced by gene targeting. Moreover, the reduction of such risks will make the research more acceptable for both livestock producers and the general public. Unfortunately, the use of advanced techniques of gene transfer will likely be limited to developed countries.",

The most useful would be mechanisms based on an element common to the life cycle of multiple viruses thus inducing resistance simultaneously to more than one virus. The new mechanisms should be designed to minimize their biological and financial costs. Targeting of transgenes into 'neutral' regions of the genome may be one such strategy. The 'neutrality' of such regions can be tested by inserts of non-functional genes. The regions proven to be 'neutral' would be subsequently used for inserts of resistance genes.

In instances of slight impairment of the production capacity of the transgenic, compared to the original stock, decisions on the practical usefulness of the modified animals will depend on comparison of the economic benefit derived from the transgene against the cost of the animals' reduced production performance.

The aim of this list is to stimulate further activity in this area by outlining the opportunities that exist.

Those acting on subsequent phases of viral life cycle are less desirable and should be considered if prevention of viral attachment and penetration is impossible.

In their evolution, some viruses have developed strategies that do not harm the host sufficiently to cause extinction of the host -and the virus. Nevertheless, in some instances virus-host coevolution has resulted in disease-producing relationships that cause economic losses and suffering of the animals and birds.

A combination of gene targeting techniques with embryonic stem cells, when such cells become available for livestock, will greatly facilitate the introduction of new, genetically engineered virus resistance. All livestock with new resistance mechanisms will have to be subjected to thorough testing. There are several possible strategies for the development of new resistance mechanisms in livestock. The transgenes to be designed for such strategies can act at various phases in the viral life cycle. Ideally, expression of the transgenes should be triggered by the presence of the inducing virus, otherwise the resistance mechanism should remain 'silent'.
