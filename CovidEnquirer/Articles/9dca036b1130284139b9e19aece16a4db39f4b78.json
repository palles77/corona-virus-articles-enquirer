            "text": "Since the 1990s, a rapid explosion in molecular-based diagnostics has occurred in veterinary medicine. Contemporaneous with this expansion, training in diagnostic medicine is declining because of loss of state and federal support of veterinary training and lack of interest in veterinary students, who primarily track into clinical programs. 1, 2 Most molecular diagnostic tests presently emphasize the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) format. The most current application is a real-time format; most companies have now developed formats that can perform a 40-cycle PCR test in 35 to 45 minutes in a high-throughput format once nucleic acids are extracted. 3 With robotics, samples can be processed and results obtained within a very short window of time. Regardless of technologic advances that apply, the same basic concepts apply when submitting samples for diagnostic testing that are based on either high-throughput or new technologies. 4, 5 Understanding Older and Newer Formats for Detection of Infection Table 1 lists the basic definitions of PCR methods. A basic understanding of the different PCR test formats is needed for continuing education of practitioners and diplomates. 1 Although it is not necessary for the practitioner to be a molecular biologist, Table 1 provides a short review of the definitions of molecular testing.",

Although diagnosis based on molecular techniques does not require a live organism, DNA and RNA are subject to the same microbiologic, biochemical, and physical factors as live organisms for degradation. 6 In some situations, genomic DNA may be robust in its survival for forensic purposes; however, overgrowth and chemical contamination of a small microbiologic sample could result in false-negative reactions for any of the aforementioned molecular techniques. A sample collected using the correct media that is solely dedicated for PCR testing should be taken. For blood, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) or purple top tubes are best. Use of EDTA as an anticoagulant for testing of virus in plasma or buffy coat is applicable for most genomic techniques and viral culture techniques. However, if one wishes to culture plasma (e.g., that of a foal) for bacteria, EDTA is bacteriostatic, and a blood culture bottle must also be collected. Anticoagulants such as heparin can inhibit PCR reactions especially when a kit extraction method is used, which is likely to be the typical formats in most diagnostic laboratories.",

Plastic, polypropylene sticks with Dacron or rayon swabs, not those with calcium alginate, are essential for nasal swabbing. 7 Cotton allows bacteria and virus to become embedded in fibers, and frequently the extraction method calls for direct extraction off the swab. This step inactivates most viruses and bacteria because of the detergent used in the first lysis step. Finally, use of a transport medium is best for viruses because this inhibits overgrowth of bacteria that may inactivate and break down nucleic acids needed for the successful detection of viruses. The proteins in the viral medium also assist in keeping the virus in a biologically active state, so this is preferable for viral culture also.",

Specimens requiring storage before shipping to a laboratory should not be stored, and the most optimal time for testing by PCR is less than 3 days in a sample stored consistently at 4\u00b0C. If one cannot ship a horse sample within the allotted time, the sample should be allowed to sit in a refrigerator for 20 minutes and then the plasma drawn off and placed in a new tube without any anticoagulants. For horses, the sample should not be centrifuged. The white blood cells of horses settle in this time and do not form a buffy coat that is adhered to red blood cells (RBCs). This allows collection of as few RBCs as possible. 8 This is essential because as RBCs lyse in older samples, heavy protein contamination occurs, and these particular proteins (iron) are toxic to many PCR reactions. Many laboratories historically have indicated shipment at either 4\u00b0C or not to exceed 75\u00b0C. The latter is not appropriate for blood or nasal specimens because of the potential for hemolysis or bacterial overgrowth, respectively. All samples should be shipped on ice packs (no wet ice) overnight for arrival within 24 hours. One should not ship expecting successful Saturday delivery, and it is our experience that samples become lost more frequently with weekend deliveries.",

For instance, a positive PCR test result means that nucleic acids that belong to the genome of that particular pathogen were detected in the sample. This agent may or may not be live, infectious, or capable of replication in that sample. At least three different scenarios may be occurring in regard to the sample tested: (1) the pathogen is present and directly is causing the clinical signs observed, (2) the pathogen is present but is not responsible for the clinical signs observed, or (3) the pathogen is not present but the reaction mixture is binding to some other target in the assay. By the same token, a negative sample has failed to detect the nucleic acids of the infectious agent. A negative result can reflect at least three different scenarios in regard to the sample tested: (1) the pathogen was absent at the time of testing, (2) the pathogen is present but not detectable within the limits of sensitivity, and (3) there was some type of inhibition of the positive reaction. The mere results cannot be interpreted without understanding the context in which testing was performed in the first place unless this is used for regulatory purposes. In the absence of case criteria, the results by themselves are not confirmatory for disease causation. This is especially true for negative tests-hence repeated sampling is recommended should the case criteria create a high degree of suspicion for that disease.

Also, use of the real-time format is more amenable to automation (hence, more rapid results). Although one article compared nested PCR with the real-time format, many of the samples in the literature are not controlled for sampling site of tissue. In our laboratory with experimental inoculation and in studies where field specimens were evaluated, the highest viral load for WNV was seen in thalamus and pons/medulla. Should these sections of brain be consistently evaluated, real-time PCR is likely reliable in horse brain. There is no question that the use of the CDC primers for detection of eastern equine encephalitis virus is sensitive and reliable. Horses have high viral load in thalamus, pons, and medulla. The same samples used for diagnostic testing for WNV also can be used for eastern equine encephalitis and western equine encephalitis testing. In arbovirus testing, plasma and serum are not appropriate for testing in horses with neurologic disease.",

Several real-time PCR techniques have been developed and validated by OIE laboratories and investigators. 34, 42 Currently, the recommended protocol is to screen for EHV-1 using a generalized target for EHV-1 glycoprotein B gene. This gene is highly conserved and can be used to differentiate EHV-1 from EHV-4. In cases in which EHV-1 presence is questionable, the OIE nested protocol is considered the PCR gold standard. When EHV-1 is identified, a special PCR protocol (a single nucleotide polymorphism assay) is run for the differentiation of the strain associated with neurologic disease from the other EHV-1 not usually associated with central nervous system disease. The specific viral mutation (ORF 30) accounts for only approximately 80% to 85% of Detection and typing of C. perfringens in the human field have advanced beyond PCR to microarray to elucidate the complexities involved in differentiation of possible clostridial food-borne and water-borne poisoning. In horses, much attention has been given to the beta-2 C. perfringens toxin as an important cause of diarrhea in adult horses and foals; however, only in the pig has active transcription of beta-2 toxins in the positive strains been documented, and only in the pig has correlation been strong to disease. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] One study has provided a wider epidemiologic correlation in horses. At the molecular level, although the toxin is present in C. perfringens type A isolates garnered from equine clinical cases, the expression of this toxin is extremely low compared with the pig. 15 Welldesigned case-control and molecular epidemiology studies are paramount for further analysis of this toxin in horses. The most commonly used technique is a conventional PCR protocol that detects the presence of the toxin genes (not activity or expression). 16 Many AAVLD laboratories now offer this technique, and it has largely supplanted biologic assays, which use rodents. This is usually performed on C. perfringens isolates rather than directly on fecal samples, although this is likely the more practical approach. Interpretation is very important because C. perfringens is a common component of fecal flora.",

Nowhere is this more apparent than for the diagnosis of Streptococcus equi subsp. equi. Because S. equi subsp. equi is in many cases the notifiable pathogen and one that control is directly correlated to biocontainment practices, differentiation and early identification of S. equi subsp. equi in an outbreak of respiratory disease is crucial. Historically, S. equi subsp. equi is differentiated from S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus on the basis of sugar fermentation. Conventional PCR was first performed with the 16S ribosomal gene and sequencing or in terms of the more easily differentiated superoxide dismutase A gene. 21 In addition, other genes, such as the SePE-I gene (pyrogenic mitogen), have been characterized and found present in S. subsp. equi but not S. subsp. zooepidemicus. 21 Both of these genes have also been characterized using a realtime format. 22 In this format, real-time PCR was able to detect and identify correctly all cultivatable S. equi subsp. equi isolates. In addition, six additional samples meeting the case criteria were positive for S. equi subsp. equi, two of which were identified as S. equi subsp. equi and four of which were identified as S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. This technique did not identify two S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus isolates. Sequencing demonstrated that the target gene had molecular differences not previously described for S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. These results compare with previously reported results for conventional PCR. Isolation and identification of S. equi subsp. equi-positive horses can be greatly enhanced by multiple sampling. Three consecutively obtained nasal swabs increase sensitivity of detection to 85%, which is equal to a single guttural pouch flushing.",

With vaccination in horses, the window of positive testing is restricted mainly to the period of clinical signs, although even vaccinated horses shed virus during an outbreak. 23 Because most outbreaks in horses are currently caused by equine-2 H3N8 influenza strains, the specificity of most viral testing is unquestioned. Virus isolation is considered the gold standard, but real-time reverse transcriptase PCR and antigen test kits are supplanting this very specialized culturing because it must be done in egg cultures (a real art). 24, 25 Real-time PCR was more sensitive than five antigen detection kits and viral isolation. 26, 27 In addition, viral detection using real-time was correlated with quantization by tissue culture techniques. PCR techniques have been developed for detection of Pneumocystis jiroveci in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Because Pneumocystis organisms are considered host-species specific, these techniques must be validated for equine infections. Likewise, invasive Aspergillus infections are another area of interest for molecular detection formats. These techniques would likely be most useful for tissue invasion rather than detection of primary respiratory infection because Aspergillus can be a transtracheal wash contaminant. Candida infection occurs in the blood of equine neonates. These infections can be extremely hard to diagnose. Other pathogenic yeasts for which PCR techniques are highly applicable include Cryptococcus neoformans, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma, and Blastomyces dermititidis. The differentiation of Pythium insidiosum infection from mucormycotic fungi in horses is extremely useful because the former is highly resistant to treatment, whereas the latter can be removed by surgical excision/debulking and respond to antifungal therapies.",

Regardless, field investigation, outbreak details, and recent molecular studies have indicated that horses affected with equine herpes myeloencephalitis shed high amounts of virus early in the course of disease, and early quarantine and detection of nasal shedding within the exposed population is paramount to control. Automated, rapid molecular assays are essential for containment of outbreaks.",

Not only will PCR allow differentiation of these species, but it is also being developed to detect egg and L3 and L4 stages of infection in horse feces. 49,50 PCR protocols also have been used to detect helminth resistance. A PCR technique for detection of Anoplocephala has been described. 20, 51 This technique is sensitive and will likely aid in detection of another equine parasite that is notoriously difficult to identify. Furthermore, this technique will likely contribute to our understanding of the relationship between acute abdominal disease in horses and infection. Habronema infection can be extremely difficult to confirm in premortem biopsy sections, especially in the Southeast United States where diagnosis is complicated by fungal infection. [51] [52] [53] An extremely sensitive technique has been developed for detection in feces. This technique needs to be validated for peripheral tissue sections.",
