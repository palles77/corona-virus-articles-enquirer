            "text": "Virus infection of host cells is sensed by innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and induces production of type I interferons (IFNs) and other inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines orchestrate the elimination of the viruses but are occasionally detrimental to the hosts. The outcomes and pathogenesis of viral infection are largely determined by the specific interaction between the viruses and their host cells. Therefore, compounds that either inhibit viral infection or modulate virus-induced cytokine response should be considered as candidates for managing virus infection. The aim of the study was to identify compounds in both categories, using a single cell-based assay. Our screening platform is a HEK293 cell-based reporter assay where the expression of a firefly luciferase is under the control of a human IFN-b promoter. We have demonstrated that infection of the reporter cell line with a panel of RNA viruses activated the reporter gene expression that correlates quantitatively with the levels of virus replication and progeny virus production, and could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by known antiviral compound or inhibitors of PRR signal transduction pathways. Using Dengue virus as an example, a pilot screening of a small molecule library consisting of 26,900 compounds proved the concept that the IFN-b promoter reporter assay can serve as a convenient high throughput screening platform for simultaneous discovery of antiviral and innate immune response modulating compounds. A representative antiviral compound from the pilot screening, 1-(6-ethoxybenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl) urea, was demonstrated to specifically inhibit several viruses belonging to the family of flaviviridae.",

To fulfill this unmet medical need, we intended to develop convenient assays for high-throughput discovery of compounds that either inhibit the replication of the viruses or alleviate their pathogenesis, which are usually resulted from uncontrolled cytokine response to viral infection and sometime life-threaten.",

The principle of the assay is based on the innate immune recognition of virus infection by host innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors, C-type lectins and many others (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010 PRRs by molecular patterns of viruses, such as viral nucleic acids, oligomers of envelope proteins and nucleocapsids, induces cellular responses leading to production of type I interferons (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines Akira, 2008, 2010) . Because activation of IFN response is a common feature of many different viruses, we established a HEK293 cell-based reporter system where expression of a firefly luciferase gene is under the control of human IFN-b promoter to quantitatively monitor the virus activated host innate immune response. Specifically, the stable cell line used in this study, 293TLR3/IFNbLuc, has intrinsic RLR pathway and a reconstituted TLR3 pathway, which are primary PRRs for many RNA viruses Loo and Gale, 2011; Negishi et al., 2008) , and therefore should be responsive to the infection of these viruses.",

Interestingly, because the levels of reporter gene expression upon the virus infection were quantitatively correlated with the levels of virus replication and progeny virion production, we have thus speculated and subsequently demonstrated that the level of luciferase expression in virally infected cells can serve as a simple and quantitative readout of viral replication activity in a high throughput manner. As we anticipated, a pilot screening of 26,900 compounds convincingly demonstrated that the IFN-b promoter reporter assay can be used as a broadly applicable platform for discovery of compounds with antiviral activity against many different viruses as well as compounds that inhibit virus-induced cytokine response. A representative antiviral compound from the pilot screening, 1-(6-ethoxybenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl) urea, was characterized in detail and demonstrated to specifically inhibit several viruses belonging to the family of flaviviridae.",

As illustrated in Fig. 5 , a total of 46 compounds were confirmed to selectively inhibit DENV induced luciferase expression in a dosedependent manner. These 46 confirmed ''hits'' were next evaluated by testing their antiviral activities against DENV with an In-cell western assay Yu et al., 2012) in Huh7.5 cells. This experiment categorized the confirmed ''hits'' into two groups. A group of 14 compounds selectively inhibit the production of DENV E protein by greater than 50% at 10 lM and thus are antivirals. The remaining 32 compounds that do not apparently affect DENV E protein production in Huh7.5 cells, but dose-dependently reduce the virus activated IFN-b promoter activities in the reporter cells, suggesting they are most likely inhibitors of virus-elicited innate immune response pathways. While the characterization of the innate immune pathway inhibitors will be reported elsewhere, the antiviral compounds were further tested for their effects on IFN-b promoter activities induced by representative positive stranded RNA virus (EMCV) and negative stranded RNA virus (TCRV) to determine their antiviral spectrum.

However, as expected, IFN-a efficiently inhibited HCV replication under both conditions. Furthermore, BPU did not inhibit the replication of HCV subgenomic replicon in Huh7 cells (Fig. 8E) . These results thus implied that BPU most likely inhibited an early or late event of HCV replication, such as entry and uncoating or virion particle assembly and secretion, but not viral protein biosynthesis/processing and RNA replication. To distinguish these two possibilities, we further demonstrated that BPU selectively inhibited the infection of HCV envelope proteins E1 and E2-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (HCVpp), but not VSV G protein-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (VSVpp).

It allows the screening to be performed with a low MOI (0.1) of infection ( Fig. 4 and Table 2 ), which supports multiple rounds of viral infection and thus allows for the identification of compounds that inhibit any step of viral replication cycle. On the contrary, many other commonly used cell-based antiviral assays, such as those based on virus induced cytopathic effect (CPE), frequently require high MOI of infection, which may preclude the identification of compounds targeting late events of viral replication cycle. In addition, although in the current study the screen was performed in 96-well plate, the assay can be easily miniaturized into 384-well format and adapted to using of liquid handling.",

            "text": "Second, in addition to identify compounds with antiviral activity, the IFN-b reporter assay can also be used for simultaneously identification of compounds that inhibit virus-elicited proinflammatory cytokine response. This is because the activation of IFN-b gene expression relies on coordinative activation of IRF3/IRF7, NFjB and MAPK pathways, and the later two pathways are also required to induce other inflammatory cytokines, therefore, monitoring the IFN-b gene activation by viral infections should cover the most, if not all, important innate immune signaling pathways. Although it was not a focus of the current study, we have demonstrated that the virus activated IFN-b promoter activity can be dose-dependently inhibited by multiple known inhibitors of these pathways ( screening has indeed identified multiple compounds with such properties (Fig. 5) . The compounds that inhibit viral induction of cytokine response could be candidates for the development of drugs that alleviate viral pathogenesis related to ''cytokine storm'', such as encephalomeningitis in West Nile virus infection (Wang et al., 2004) , hemorrhagic fevers in the infection of DENV, Ebola virus and many other viruses (Paessler and Walker, 2013; Pang et al., 2007; Wauquier et al., 2010) as well as severe pneumonia in influenza A virus or SARS-coronavirus infection (Cheng et al., 2011; Oslund and Baumgarth, 2011; Theron et al., 2005) . Alternatively, these compounds could also serve as chemical genetic probes for studying virus-host interaction. Unlike siRNA-mediated knockdown and other genome-wide gene discovery technologies, this chemical genetic approach is likely to identify host functions that are potentially ''drugable'' (de Chassey et al., 2012; Panda and Cherry, 2012) . We are aware of the possibility that certain compounds identified with antiviral activity might indirectly inhibit viral replication by either enhancing virus-elicited IFN response or attenuate the viral suppression of IFN response. However, because Huh7.5 cells used for our antiviral assay in the secondary screen are deficient in both TLR3 and RIG-I pathways, it is unlikely that the antiviral compounds we identified in this study inhibit viral replication via such a mechanism.",

Thus the IFN-b promoter reporter assay might also be used to screen for compounds that can restore the innate immune response induced by these viruses.

            "text": "Forth, the assay is resource efficient. Because activation of the IFN response is a common property of many different viruses, the assay can serve as a broadly applicable HTS platform for any virus that can infect the cells. Along this line, the robustness of the reporter assay also makes it feasible for parallel screening with multiple viruses. In fact, such a multiplex viral screening should reveal virus-specific and broad-spectrum antiviral compounds as well as compounds disrupting virus-specific or common innate immune response pathways. The information obtained from the multiplex viral screening will help prioritize the active compounds for further development as therapeutics and/or molecular probes. For instance, the compounds that hit the common ''choke'' points of host functions required for replication of many different viruses can potentially serve as candidates for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, or experimental probes to reveal the commonly required host functions for viral replication or induction of host antiviral response (Ma-Lauer et al., 2012) . Finally, characterization of representative antiviral ''hits'' from our pilot HTS clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the reporter assay for discovery of antiviral compounds. BPU is an antiviral compound that inhibits the infection of viruses from at least two genera of the flaviviridae family, but not EMCV and TCRV, the representative positive and negative-stranded RNA viruses, respectively. Mechanistic analysis further demonstrated that the compound inhibited the entry of HCV, and possibly other flaviviruses, by targeting common entry factor(s) shared by these viruses. Chemically, BPU has an N-benzothiazolyl N 0 -phenyl urea core structure with two alkoxy substitutions (Fig. 6A ). Several analogs with this core structure have been found to have antiviral activity against HIV (D'Cruz et al., 2002; Paget et al., 1969) , inhibit Type III secretion systems in pathogenic bacteria (PCT Int. Appl. 2009, WO2009145829A1) , as well as inhibit the ubiquitin ligase (PCT Int. Appl. 2005, WO 2005037845A1 ). However, the biological activity of compounds with the unique alkoxy substitutions in BPU has not been reported. Although BPU is not a highly potent antiviral compound, its structure is tractable for chemical modification and structure-activity relationship studies for future development into potential antiviral therapeutic.",

Immediately after 1 h incubation with the virus, the infected cells were either mock treated or treated with indicated doses of BPU. (A) For DENV, culture media were collected at 48 post infection, and measured for virus titers using plaque assay. (B) For YFV, cells were fixed 48 h post infection, and measured for YFV E protein using In-cell western assay followed by quantification of fluorescent intensity. (C) For HCV, total RNA was extracted from cells 4 days post infection to determine HCV RNA by qRT-PCR assay. Values were expressed as percentage of mock treated controls (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, n P 3). Dose-dependent inhibition curves were generated to calculate EC 50 and EC 90 values. CC 50 values were determined by MTT-based cell viability assay.",
