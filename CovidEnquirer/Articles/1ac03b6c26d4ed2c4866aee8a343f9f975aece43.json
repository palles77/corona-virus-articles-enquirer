The probability is good that most ferrets will develop a neoplasm of the endocrine system during the \"golden age\" for tumors (4 to 6 years) and excellent that some type of neoplasm will become evident over the course of a lifetime. In ferrets derived from American bloodlines, the incidence of three neoplasms-adrenocortical neoplasia, insulinoma, and malignant lymphoma-likely exceeds the incidence of all other neoplasms combined.",

Clinical discussion is derived from the authors' clinical experiences as well as a comprehensive review of available literature. Space does not permit us to cover every type of neoplasm that has been reported in the ferret (as rarer and rarer tumors find their way into single case reports); thus we present only the major types of neoplasms, including their diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.",

The clinical behavior, prognosis, and paraneoplastic syndromes in ferrets are often far different from what is seen with similar neoplasms in dogs or cats. For example, insulinoma in the ferret is a neoplasm that rarely metastasizes and behaves in a benign fashion, as opposed to the same neoplasm in dogs and cats, which metastasizes widely and rapidly and results in short survival times. Adrenocortical carcinoma, a neoplasm prone to metastasize widely in the dog, metastasizes only late in the course of disease in ferrets; with early removal, it warrants a good prognosis. Mast cell tumors, often malignant (and fatal) in the dog, are invariably benign and associated with a good prognosis in ferrets. Thus, practitioners who extrapolate diagnostic and therapeutic options from comparable syndromes in more traditional pet species may find themselves in difficult and unexpected situations.",

            "text": "Three main schools of thought exist for ferrets, and it is likely that many neoplasms may be the result of several coexisting factors at once: 1. Husbandry issues. The \"domestication\" of the ferret as a pet species in many countries of the world involves varying degrees of environmental and surgical manipulation of the animal itself. Proof surrounding the effects of early neutering of ferrets and the subsequent development of adrenocortical neoplasia is now published and this mechanism is widely accepted. 7, 53, 54 Dietary manipulation, especially the common practice of feeding high-carbohydrate diets and treats, has been suggested to be a primary cause for the increased incidence of insulinoma (when compared with the incidence in animals fed raw whole prey [rats, mice, etc.] as the dietary staple). 53 Finally, the modern ferret owner's predilection for indoor housing and artificial lighting may also play a role in the development of certain types of neoplasms. In Europe, where most ferrets are housed outdoors and exposed to natural lighting cycles, the incidence of neoplasia, especially adrenocortical, is greatly decreased. 53 However, other factors, including delayed neutering, may also affect the development of neoplasia in European ferrets. 2. Genetic (familial) predisposition. While genetic or chromosomal aberrations are yet to be studied in domestic ferrets, the tremendous incidence of neoplasia in American bloodlines of ferrets as compared with their European counterparts certainly lends credence to this widely held belief. A recent case report by Fox 22 documents a syndrome of multiple neoplasms in an adult ferret that closely resembles (multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 in humans, a condition known to be the result of a genetic point mutation. 3. Infectious agents. Suspicious cluster outbreaks of malignant lymphoma in laboratory colonies and rescue operations 3, 18 have sparked the investigation of a possible viral etiology for this neoplasm in ferrets. Transforming retroviruses are known to be responsible for the development of lymphoma in a number of other species, including humans, cats, and rabbits among others. Erdman 20 demonstrated the transmissibility of this neoplasm between ferrets using cell-free inocula, thus furthering this theory, although a prolonged incubation time was required. Helicobacter mustelae, a ubiquitous inhabitant of the stomach of ferrets, has been circumstantially incriminated in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma 33 (which is enhanced when coupled with the ingestion of chemical carcinogens as promoters) 21, 23 as well as in the development of gastric B-cell (MALT) lymphomas. 17 In addition, a progression from chronic inflammatory intestinal disease to neoplasia has been proposed in cats. 70 ",

In a study of 66 cases in which ferrets had multiple concurrent neoplasms, Li 36 found no evidence of an association between tumor type and multiplicity.

This neoplasm is most commonly seen in middle-aged ferrets, with no gender predilection. Insulinoma in the ferret exhibits a far different behavior than in the dog or cat. 9, 62 In the dog and cat, these are highly malignant neoplasms with marked metastatic potential, leading to a short survival time. In ferrets, these same neoplasms have low metastatic potential and tend to respond well to medical management for long periods of time; their removal may result in a symptom-free or medication-free interval. 62 In truth, some reports have clouded the issue of metastatic potential of insulinoma in the ferret. True metastasis involves the translocation, either via blood or lymph, to another organ; this is seen in the dog and cat, where the metastasis of islet cell tumors to local lymph nodes, liver, or other visceral organs is common. Some papers have incorrectly referred to the additional development of insulinoma within the pancreas over time as \"metastasis,\" whereas recurrence would be a more appropriate term. Other papers have labeled islet cell tumors as malignant (\"islet cell carcinomas\") based solely on microscopic features of the tumor cells without evidence of intraorgan translocation or recurrent disease.",

Some individuals may present with a history of neurologic disease and a normal fasting blood glucose; in the early stages of this condition, insulin release may be sporadic and clinical signs may be intermittent. The determination of insulin levels is rarely indicated prior to institution of therapy and is of no value in cases where blood glucose is above 60 mg/dL.

Excision of the vena cava carries a high risk of complications including renal failure and death, and these risks are greater than the risk of death from adrenal disease. While presurgical ultrasound examination may be used to identify the side (or sides) at which an affected neoplasm is located, the absence of adrenomegaly or an identifiable nodule via ultrasound does not obviate the need for surgery in affected individuals, since functional lesions may be present in normal-sized adrenal glands. 6 Several options for medical management have emerged in recent years (see Chapters 7 and 11 for more in-depth discussions of surgical and medical treatments).",

These drugs are temporarily effective and are useful in ameliorating clinical signs; however, their effectiveness in halting the growth of established lesions or diminishing the risk of metastatic disease or hemoperitoneum associated with large tumors is still in question. 60 Other neoplasms may be seen arising from adrenal glands in ferrets. First described in 1995, 24 leiomyosarcomas of the adrenal capsule are often encountered in the ferret and may result in confusion on the part of the practitioner as well as the pathologist. These very firm neoplasms may lead practitioners to perform adrenalectomy on normally functioning adrenal glands. Unfortunately these cannot be differentiated without histopathology, so the practitioner is forced to make an intraoperative decision. The presence of the tumor may also mask the presence of proliferative adrenocortical lesions unless multiple sections at 1 mm or more are examined. These neoplasms have demonstrated estrogen receptors on the smooth muscle cells in several of these tumors, suggesting a possible etiology for their development as well as the common finding of smooth muscle proliferation in adrenocortical tumors. 41",

Cutaneous (epitheliotropic) lymphoma is of T-cell origin and possesses a mature lymphocytic phenotype and a profound affinity to infiltrate epithelial structures, such as the epidermis and hair follicles ( Fig. 8-2 ). It alone among the ferret lymphomas does not warrant a poor prognosis at onset, as prolonged survival times (possibly up to 3-4 years) are associated with it, especially in cases where cutaneous lesions are rapidly surgically excised. Unlike epitheliotropic lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) in dogs and humans, the clinical picture does not necessarily progress to systemic involvement (S\u00e9zary's syndrome). Epitheliotropic lymphoma is commonly seen in the feet and extremities of ferrets, resulting in grossly swollen, hyperemic, alopecic feet. Untreated, these lesions grow in size and multiple lesions will develop. Complete surgical excision of cutaneous lesions may result in prolonged disease-free intervals; chemotherapeutic attempts, both topical and systemic, have generally proved to be unsatisfactory. 34, 50 Gastric lymphomas, or mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, have been reported in four ferrets (see also Chapter 3). 17 Considered akin to lymphomas associated with Helicobacter pylori infection in humans, these neoplasms arose in the stomach of ferrets infected with Helicobacter mustelae. An interesting feature of this proposed form of lymphoma is that although neoplastic cells varied in phenotype (two lymphocytic and two lymphoblastic forms), all four cases were composed of monoclonal B lymphocytes. 17",

Aspirates of enlarged nodes may result in a diagnosis in the hands of a trained pathologist or experienced practitioner, but false readings due to sample preparation, reactive changes, and well-differentiated neoplasms may occur. The possibility of false negatives is increased when aspirates of visceral organs are performed. Ultrasonographically obtained fine-needle aspirates of the mesenteric lymph nodes in normal ferrets yielded 50 to 60 small lymphocytes, 2 to 3 lymphoblasts and prolymphocytes, and 0 to 1 macrophages, plasma cells, and nondegenerate neutrophils per 200\u00b4 field. 45 Eosinophils (up to 10 per 200\u00b4 field) were also identified in some normal ferret mesenteric lymph node aspirates and did not correlate with peripheral blood eosinophilia. 45 The cytologic hallmarks of lymphoma are a monotonous population of lymphocytes and the absence of peripheral blood elements. A range of cell sizes and types or the presence of other types of white blood cells in aspirated nodes is not consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoma. In cases of suspected leukemia, form a bone marrow aspiration via the proximal femur by using an 18-to 20-gauge bone marrow-collection needle. An alternate technique for obtaining a sample is a core bone biopsy, which may provide a better diagnostic yield (Fig. 8-7) . In most cases of leukemia, the bone marrow is hypercellular and often monomorphic. Microscopic examination reveals a significant decrease or total absence of normal marrow elements such as fat.",

Loss of fur and whiskers is common in ferrets but insignificant to the animal. Gastrointestinal effects do occur, so providing antinausea drugs such as metoclopramide, ondansetron, or maropitant citrate (Cerenia, Pfizer Animal Health, Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) is recommended. These drugs are preferred as they target the chemoreceptor trigger zone and peripheral receptors, which are the primary mediators of chemotherapy-induced nausea. GI protectants may also be beneficial. More serious adverse effects are cytopenias, particularly neutropenia, which predisposes patients to secondary infection and potential sepsis. Since the low end of normal WBCs in ferrets is lower than that in dogs and cats, it is necessary to redefine parameters for neutropenia that are more specific to ferrets. Any patient receiving chemotherapy who develops neutropenia (WBC < 1000/\u03bcL) should receive prophylactic antibiotics. If fever develops, hospitalize the patient immediately for intravenous antibiotic and fluid administration; this is a true oncologic emergency. Patients who are hospitalized under these circumstances generally respond well within 24 to 36 hours, while those that do not receive intravenous antibiotic therapy may suffer from more serious effects and prolonged recovery or even death. If either of these adverse effects occurs, separate the interval for administration (if multiple drugs were administered concurrently) to determine which drug is responsible for the adverse effect and decrease the dosage by 20% for future administrations.",

Chemotherapy gloves are thicker than regular gloves and therefore provide extra protection against contact. If these are not available, double-gloving is recommended. Protective eyewear should be worn. In addition to syringes and needles, all materials that come in contact with chemotherapeutic agents (gloves, catheters) must be disposed of in appropriate biohazard containers. Certain medications (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil) can be compounded into oral suspensions for more accurate dosing. These drugs should be stored in double plastic bags and appropriately labeled. Do not send compounded chemotherapeutic liquids home with owners, as spillage can occur and lead to potential exposure of owners, children, and other pets. When intravenous administration of chemotherapy drugs is necessary, a clean stick is imperative to prevent extravasation of the drug. Because a CBC is often required before administering chemotherapeutic drugs, collect a blood sample for the CBC from the jugular vein to preserve the peripheral veins for catheters. Sedate the ferret for placement of an intravenous catheter to deliver the chemotherapeutic agent; the catheter can be removed immediately after administration. Alternatively, a vascular access system can be surgically implanted and subsequently used for all intravenous administration without sedation. The use of these ports in ferrets has been well described. 2, 47 Protocols. Several protocols have been described for the treatment of lymphoma in ferrets. There are no studies comparing treatment modalities to date, and no evidence supports the use of one protocol over another. However, in humans as well as dogs and cats, combinations of cyclophosphamide, vincristine (Oncovin), and prednisone (COP) and/or COP with hydroxydaunorubicin (CHOP) represent the standard of care for lymphoma. In dogs, protocols containing doxorubicin result in the best clinical response and longest length of response. 30, 48 Table  8 -4 provides a COP protocol that is used in one author's (NA's) practice. The \"Wisconsin protocol,\" which includes doxorubicin and is used in dogs and cats, provides a more aggressive approach and can also be used. Tufts University has created a \"no IV\" protocol that enables the administration of multiple drugs without the need for vascular access (Table 8-5 ). Other chemotherapeutic protocols have also been used (Table 8-6). Table 8 -7 provides a list of chemotherapeutic drugs reported in publications that have been used in ferrets; it is probable that still more drugs have been used; their dosages may be available on various oncology list-serves and discussion groups. Although many drug doses are calculated out on a \"square meter\" basis, there is a nominal difference between that measure and body weight in patients weighing less than 1 kg. A conversion table is provided in Table  8 -8 for ease of dosing and calculation.",

Alterations in lipid metabolism can lead to immunosuppression. Some tumor cells make poor use of lipid as a source of energy. This implies that a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet may result in a greater chance of remission and a longer survival time. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to inhibit tumorigenesis in animal models. 42 Most high-quality ferret diets are ideal because of their high protein and fat content.

Apocrine neoplasms are most often seen in areas where scent glands are concentrated (head, neck, prepuce, and vulva). Approximately 75% of preputial neoplasms of apocrine origin (as well as 100% of the less common perianal and perivulvar tumors) are malignant, exhibiting aggressive infiltration of local tissues, metastasis to local nodes, and occasionally pulmonary metastasis. Complete surgical excision of apocrine malignancies is difficult because of their rapid and aggressive growth as well as the distinct possibility of presurgical metastasis. Excise any suspected apocrine neoplasms with wide surgical margins to minimize the potential for metastasis. Use advancement flaps or y-plasty, if necessary, for closure or reconstruction of the prepuce. In cases of apocrine carcinoma of the prepuce, appropriate surgical treatment may entail amputation of the prepuce and urethrostomy. Submit all excised tissues for evaluation of surgical margins. Radiation therapy may be a valuable postoperative treatment to aid in eliminating any local residual malignant cells, and chemotherapy can be used as an adjunct to decrease the risk of metastasis.",

The most common clinical sign in affected animals is profound ascites (\"malignant\" ascites). 67 Perform abdominocentesis in such cases; identification of rafts of atypical mesothelial cells may accomplish diagnosis. As normal mesothelial cells may be seen in any abdominal tap, exercise care to avoid misdiagnosis.",

Sophisticated techniques may yield clues to a tumor cell's origin even if it does not resemble the parent tissue. Immunohistochemical procedures to identify tissue specific intermediate filaments or ultrastructural analysis of cellular organelles by electron microscopy may identify characteristic organelles for a particular cell type. Today, the use of these advanced techniques at large referral laboratories lends insight into the origin of a particular neoplasm; in doing so, it provides important information concerning therapeutic approaches and prognosis. However, many smaller laboratories are not equipped to perform these tests routinely, and a broad diagnosis of \"poorly differentiated\" carcinoma, sarcoma, or round cell tumor is often the result.",

Sarcomas of the skin were the largest single classification of poorly differentiated tumors but likely the most responsive to treatment (i.e., surgery). As sarcomas of the skin tend to have low metastatic potential, a definitive identification of cell of origin (smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, fibrocyte, etc.) is of little clinical importance. However, the remainder of the poorly differentiated neoplasms generally carry a poor prognosis, especially those present in abdominal organs.",

However, these instruments are too large for use in ferrets. Instead, samples can be obtained from the humerus or femur with a standard bone marrow biopsy instrument, but the technique must be modified because these lack beveled tips (open arrow) (A). After a stab incision is made in the skin, the bone marrow needle is introduced without the stylet. Both cortices of bone are penetrated and the needle is advanced through the skin on the opposite side of the limb (B). Without removing the needle, a collection cassette is placed at the tip of the needle; the stylet is then introduced (open arrowhead) to expel the core bone biopsy (closed arrowhead) (C, D).
