Central diabetes insipidus was demonstrated by means of a low measured anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) concentration in the face of hypernatraemia, and clinical response to supplementation with desmopressin. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a discrete mass in the region of the hypothalamus. The cat was euthanased and post-mortem histological examination demonstrated B cell lymphoma involving the brain, optic nerves, urinary bladder wall and diaphragm.

Fundoscopic examination by a registered veterinary ophthalmology specialist identified patchy chorioretinitis in both retinas. These changes were considered consistent with protozoal chorioretinitis, but it was felt they were not severe enough to cause blindness. Toxoplasma serology was run, and IgG was positive at 1:1024, and IgM was positive at 1:128. Treatment was initiated with prednisolone (Delta-Cortef; Upjohn) 0.8 mg/kg q 12 h and clindamycin (Antirobe; Pfizer) 25 mg/kg q 12 h. Within 3 days, the cat's vision returned, and the cat remained clinically normal for approximately 1 month. The prednisolone dosage was decreased to q 24 h after 2 weeks, and q 48 h after 4 weeks. Within 2 weeks of discontinuing the prednisolone, the cat was represented to the referring veterinary surgeon with blindness and severe lethargy. At that time, the cat was referred to Melbourne University Veterinary Hospital.",

Clinical examination indicated normovolaemia. Underlying differentials for pure water loss include primary hypodipsia/adipsia, lack of access to water, fever, burns, panting, secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), central diabetes insipidus (CDI), or primary NDI (rare). Of these differentials, only diabetes insipidus would account for hypernatraemia and hyposthenuria. Intravenous fluid therapy was commenced at 5 ml/ kg/h. The fluid type initially chosen was lactated Ringer's solution (LRS) with 2.5% dextrose supplemented with additional NaCl to produce a sodium concentration of 160 mmol/l. This was undertaken with the aim of decreasing the serum sodium concentration at a rate no faster than 0.5 mEq/l/h. Electrolytes were rechecked repeatedly during this infusion (see Table 1 ). After the first 2 h, the sodium concentration increased to 182 mmol/l, and oscillated between 182 and 185 mmol/l throughout the first 24 h of treatment. For this reason the sodium concentration of the intravenous fluid was serially decreased. The cat remained clinically the same throughout this phase of the treatment.",

Sodium is the main determinant of osmolarity, and so hypernatraemia results in an increased cerebrospinal fluid osmolarity, and this is detected by a series of so-called circumventricular organs. These organs, located in the anterior wall of the third ventricle, are the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and the SFO. The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) is also involved in thirst detection, and is located inside the bloodebrain barrier, but is not considered part of the circumventricular organ system. In rodent models, experiments have demonstrated connections between these organs and thirst centres elsewhere in the brain. 5 ADH is produced by the SON and PVN in the hypothalamus, from where it is transmitted to, and subsequently released from, the posterior pituitary. 4 The SON and PVN are osmoreceptive, and hyperosmolarity directly stimulates ADH production. Additionally, the SON and PVN receive input from the circumventricular organs described above. 5 In summary, hypernatraemia results in two distinct but interrelated processes: the stimulation of thirst, and the release of ADH. In the normal animal, these responses occur simultaneously, but it is possible to experimentally decouple these processes, and cause a selective incapacity of either thirst or ADH production (Fig 4) .",

A lesion that destroyed the organs of ADH production, but preserved the mechanism of thirst, would be consistent with these observations. The identified tumour had obliterated the region containing the PVN and SON, as well as the ventral circumventricular region, but had preserved the more dorsal circumventricular region. It was hypothesised that part or all of the SFO or MnPO may have been spared, which would be sufficient to preserve the thirst response, a hypothesis supported by the finding of an histologically intact SFO. The MnPO could not be confidently identified histologically, which is unsurprising, as it is normally not a histologically distinctive structure.",

ADH was not tested, nor any supplementary ADH administered in that case. In order for thirst to be lacking in that case, we hypothesise that the OVLT, MnPO and SFO were damaged by that tumour. To the authors' knowledge this is the first reported case of CDI caused by intracranial neoplasia in a cat. CDI has been associated with B cell lymphoma in a dog, 7 and has also been described in several case series and reports in cats. 8e15 The underlying cause of CDI in the feline cases has been reported as congenital, 10,14 traumatic 14,15 or idiopathic. 9 The position of the lesion raised the possibility that other aspects of hypothalamopituitary function could be impaired. The results of an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, endogenous ACTH, thyroxine, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) assessments were not supportive of this possibility. The testing of other hormones, including growth hormone and IGF-1 could also be considered in such a case but were not taken in this instance due to time, financial and sample handling constraints.",
