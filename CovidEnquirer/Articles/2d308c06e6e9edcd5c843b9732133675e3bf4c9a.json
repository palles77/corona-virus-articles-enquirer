A literature search for studies involving the seven isolated tanshinone hits showed that at present, none have been identified as coronaviral protease inhibitors. We have identified that all of the isolated tanshinones are good inhibitors of both cysteine proteases. However, their activity was slightly affected by subtle changes in structure and targeting enzymes. All isolated compounds (1-7) act as time dependent inhibitors of PL pro , but no improved inhibition was observed following preincubation with the 3CL pro . In a detail kinetic mechanism study, all of the tanshinones except rosmariquinone (7) were identified as noncompetitive enzyme isomerization inhibitors. However, rosmariquinone (7) showed a different kinetic mechanism through mixed-type simple reversible slow-binding inhibition. Furthermore, tanshinone I (5) exhibited the most potent nanomolar level inhibitory activity toward deubiquitinating (IC 50 = 0.7 lM). Additionally, the inhibition is selective because these compounds do not exert significant inhibitory effects against other proteases including chymotrysin, papain, and HIV protease. These findings provide potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV viral infection and replication.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV is a single-stranded positive-strand RNA virus, and its genome structure comprises both replicases and structural regions. 2 It encodes two overlapping polyproteins, ppla (486 kDa) and pplab (790 kDa). 3 The polypeptides are released from each polyprotein through extensive proteolytic processing, primarily performed by the virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease 3CL pro (also called the main protease, M pro ) with additional cleavage performed by the viral papain-like protease PL pro . 4 Because of their essential roles in viral replication, both proteases are recognized as attractive targets for the development of anti-SARS therapeutics. 5 Not surprisingly, numerous studies related to the development of SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors have already been reported. The active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro contains Cys145 and His41, constituting a catalytic dyad in which cysteine functions as the common nucleophile in the proteolytic process. 6 Untill now, all of the inhibitor studies have focused on the SARS-CoV 3CL pro and have utilized both synthetic peptidyl libraries and naturally derived libraries. Examples of the peptide-derive inhibitors include C2-symmetric diols, 7 quinolinecarboxylic acids, 8 and anilides, 9 and the naturally derived inhibitors include quinone-methide triterpens, 10 and biflavonoids amentoflavone, 11 which are included in our screen of natural products with activity against 3CL pro . In contrast, structural and functional studies focused on PL pro are far less numerous but have established important roles for PL pro beyond viral peptide cleavage, including deubiquitination, deISGylation, and involvement in virus evasion of the innate response. 12 It is located on polypeptide 1a and undergoes selfcleavage at three sites on the polypeptide. Its catalytic triad (Cys1651-His1812-Asp1826) has a broad range of optimum pH values, characteristic of papain-like cysteine protease. 12, 13 To date, only a small number of inhibitors of PL pro have been studied, including molecules identified from high-throughput screening, such as thiopurine analogs, 14 benzamide derivatives, 15 and the noncovelent inhibitor GRL0617. 16 Despite numerous biochemical, strucutral, and inhibitor-development studies directed at 3CL pro and PL pro , potent antiviral that directly target proteases have yet to be developed.",

As a first step toward this goal, we expressed SARS-CoV 3CL pro in E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus-RIL cells, purified the protein to homogeneity, and evaluated a FRET-based peptide cleavage assay to measure the kinetic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The purification consisted of a combination of hydrophobic interaction and anion exchange chromatography and resulted in a purified single protein with a weight of approximately 33 kDa.

In this study, the SARS-CoV cysteine proteases' inhibitory activity was evaluated with the above expressed proteins and substrates following the general procedure previously described. 11, 16 The inhibition of proteases slowly increased with increasing concentrations of the corresponding compounds.

The results of the inhibition studies of both proteases are expresses as IC 50 values and are reported in Table 1 . First, the inhibitory potencies and capacities of these tanshinones toward SARS-CoV 3CL pro were investigated. The SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitory activity was assayed by following the proteolysis of the fluorogenic substrate in the presence or absence of the test compounds, as described in our previous studies. 11 As shown in Table 1 , all isolated tanshinones examined, apart from cryptotanshinone (4), exhibited a dosedependent inhibitory effect on 3CL pro ( Fig. 2A) ; however, the compounds did not have time-dependent inhibition profiles. No improved inhibitory activity was observed after preincubation of the inhibitors with 3CL pro . Salvianolic acid B, a representative bioactive compound in the hydrophilic fraction, did not show a significant inhibitory effect (30% at 200 lM). We found that the activity of these compounds ranged from 14.4 to 89.1 lM against 3CL pro . Importantly, dihydrotanshinone I (6) showed extremely high inhibition with an IC 50 value of 14.4 lM. In addition, the activity was slightly affected by subtle changes in structure. To identify the active inhibitory pharmacophore, a structure-function relationship study was carried out. Initially, the presence of naphthalene in the diterpene quinolone backbone appeared to be important for activity in comparison to the presence of dimethyl tetranaphthalene. For example, 1 and 4 contain dimethyl tetranaphthalene and have IC 50 values of 89.1 and 226.7 lM, respectively, while 5 and 6 contain naphthalene and showed IC 50 values of 38.7 and 14.4 lM. Subsequently, when we compared a series of tanshinone II analogs (1-4), we found that the introduction of a dihydrofuran moiety on the A-ring to this group (4) decreases the inhibitory activity $2-fold, which is in contrast to the results obtained with inhibitors 1-3 that have furan moiety. The hydroxymethyl group on the D-ring derivative 2 exhibited improvement of enzyme inhibitory activity with an IC 50 value of 24.8 lM. The corresponding methyl ester on the D-ring of derivative 3 also showed a similar potency enhancement (IC 50 = 21.1 lM). In contrast, the dihydrofuran moiety of tanshinone I (6, IC 50 = 14.4 lM) turned out to be more potent than furan (5, IC 50 = 38.7 lM) within the series of tanshinone I analogs (5 and 6).",

The initial rates were calculated from the first 5 min of the progress curves. Interestingly, all of the isolated compounds showed a time-dependent inhibitory effect on PL pro activity, which is the first report of naturally derived inhibitors of PL pro . As can be observed from the data presented in Table 1 and Figure 2B , when the isolated compounds from S. miltiorrhiza were preincubated for 60 min, they showed more inhibition than those without incubation. Most of these tanshinones show an increased inhibition of the enzymatic activity of PL pr\u00b0C ompared to 3CL pro in the nanomolar or micromolar range. As evidenced from the PL pro inhibition, the dimethyl tetrahydronaphthalen structure showed a more potent inhibitory response than the naphthalene chymotype. Of the isolated tanshinones, cryptotanshinone (4) displayed the most potent inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 0.8 lM). By comparing the series of tanshinone II derivatives, it was shown that the furan moiety on the A-ring does not show improved inhibition with PL pro . This result was unexpected because of the increased inhibition of 3CL pro with 1 compared to that of 4. Tanshinone IIA (1, IC 50 = 1.6 lM) showed a two-fold lower inhibition effect than cryptotanshinone (4). Similar trends can also be observed with tanshinone I (5, IC 50 = 8.8 lM) and dihydrotanshinone I (6, IC 50 = 4.9 lM), which showed respectively similar inhibitory activities because they have similar A-ring structures. Other tanshinone II analogs 2 (IC 50 = 10.7 lM) and 3 (IC 50 = 9.2 lM) suggested that the presence of a hydroxymethyl and methyl ester on the D-ring has a weak effect on inhibition potency. Interestingly, the abietane analog, rosmariquinone (7), displayed significant activity against both SARS-CoV cysteine proteases with IC 50 values of 21.1 and 30.0 lM. The abietane skeleton is structurally related to the tanshinones, and its activity is noteworthy, suggesting that further research on this important lead compound is needed.",

Reaction progress curves in the presence of varied concentrations of the isolated tanshinones are illustrated. Taken as an ensemble, the residual enzyme activity decreases as a function PL pro /tanshinones incubation time in Figure 3 . Representatively, compound 4 show a clear time-and concentration-dependent approach to the steadystate because it curves downwards, which is characteristic of slow-binding inhibition kinetics ( Fig. 3A and Fig. S50 ). All of the PL pro inhibitors (1-7) manifested the same relationship for the enzyme activity. Slow-binding inhibition mechanisms can be investigated by preincubation of the enzyme with the inhibitor, followed by measurement of the initial velocities for substrate proteolysis as a function of preincubation time. Increasing the concentration of compound 4 led to a decrease in both the initial velocity (v i ) and the steady-state rate (v s ). The progress curves obtained using various concentrations of the inhibitors were fit to (Eq. 1) to determine v i , v s , and k obs . The plot represents the relationship between k obs and [I] for all possible inhibition modes (simple reversible slow-binding, enzyme isomerization, and mechanism-based inhibition) to determine which kinetic profile was at play. The kinetic parameters (k 3 , k 4 , k 5 , k 6 , and K i app ) were derived from the plots by fitting the results ( Table 2 ). The results of all the inhibitors were fit to the slow-binding (Eq. 2), illustrating a hyperbolic dependence of k obs on the concentration of PL pro by tanshinones except for rosmariquinone (7) . Based on the above kinetic observations, we believed that the reaction undergoes the following kinetic mechanism ( Fig. 3B and Fig. S51 ). The hyperbolic dependence observed with the inhibitors suggests that they inhibit PL pro by rapid formation of an enzyme complex (E\u00c1I), which slowly isomerizes to from a modified enzyme complex (E \u2044 \u00c1I) (Fig. 4) . This is expected to sustain an inhibitory process longer than conventional inhibitors because k 5 is higher than k 6 . Interestingly, the only abietane-containing structure, rosmariquinone (7), found in the isolated compounds was shown to be time dependent because k obs exhibited a linear dependence on the inhibitor concentration as depicted in Figure  3C . Thus, this result proves that the abietane type compound 7 from S. miltiorrhiza inhibits SARS-CoV PL pro by the simple reversible slow-binding model according to the data yielded by the analysis by Eqs. (3) and (4) as listed in Table 2 . This conclusion suggests that the four-ringed inhibitors may have a different binding mode than the three-ringed inhibitor. Additionally, these compounds represent a new class of SARS-CoV PL pro inhibitors and, to our knowledge, are the first naturally derived, potent and time-dependent inhibitors of this enzyme.",

The enzymatic activity was measured with a series of substrate concentrations and various inhibitor concentrations. The inhibition data were globally fit to all of the possible kinetic models. As a result of this kinetic analysis, we found that S. miltiorrhiza-derived proteases inhibitors could be divided into two classes based upon their mode of inhibition. These classes could also be divided on the basis of their structure for the targeted enzyme. The isolated tanshinones (1-3 and 5-7) exhibit noncompetitive inhibition characteristics toward 3CL pro (see Supplementary data Fig. S46 and Fig. S47 ). In case of PL pro kinetic plots, four-ringed tanshinones (1-6) also showed noncompetitive inhibition kinetics (see Supplementary data Fig. S48 and Fig. S49 ). The three-ringed compound 7 was the only exception to this rule. As illustrated representatively in Figure 5A , the inhibition kinetics analyzed by Dixon plots shows that compound 4 has a noncompetitive mechanism because the Dixon plot of [I] versus 1/V results in a family of straight lines with the same x-axis intercept, as illustrated for the substrate concentrations. Compound 7 displayed mixed type inhibition against SARS-CoV PL pro , as shown in the Dixon plot (Fig. 5B) . The Dixon plot of [I] versus 1/V resulted in a family of straight lines with an above the [I]-axis intercept. These kinetic mechanisms support the inferences drawn from the time-dependent assay, which reveals the important roles of the SARS-CoV PL pro inhibition modes. Notably, most slow-binding enzyme inhibitors act as competitive inhibitors, although it is possible for them to interact with the enzyme by competitive, noncompetitive, or uncompetitive inhibitioin pattens. Despite having similar molecular size and functionality, the diterpene quinolone tanshinone derivatives, 1-6, inhibit the SARS-CoV PL pro isomerization slow-binding mode, whereas the abietane type derivative, 7, is active against PL pro through the simple slow-binding mode.",

To experimentally confirm the predicted DUB activity of the isolated cysteine protease inhibitors, we observed the DUB activity for in vitro characterization. Table 3 To date, there is no potent and selective chemical compound available for the inhibition of DUB. Hence, the biological consequence of inhibiting DUB is not clear at the moment. Moreover, the function of the DUB activity of PL pro in vivo is unknown, as is the identity of its in vivo cellular substrate. 14 Thus, further investigation is necessary to determine the specifics of the inhibition with the tanshinones and the PL pro -DUB interaction. Other studies are needed to measure the cleavage of the ubiquitin-like protein, interferon (IFN)-induced 15 kDa protein (ISG15), from an ISG15-fusion protein, suggesting de-ISGylation by PL pro as a mechanism by which SARS-CoV inactivates an IFN-a/b-induced innate immune response. 22 Subsequently, compounds 1-7 were also evaluated against various proteases to study their selectivity and no detectable inhibition of any of the other proteases tested was observed (Table 3) . Nevertheless, no detectable inhibition was observed at that concentration, indicating that tanshinones have an interesting selectivity for the viral proteases and could prove to be a viable lead for these proteolytic enzymes. Currently, there are many reports of rational designs and library-based screens that have identified several small molecules that act as potent inhibitors of the replication of SARS-CoV but are also HIV protease inhibitors. In contrast to this, our tanshinones-based viral protease inhibitors did not show a significant HIV protease inhibition effect.",

The virally encoded 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) and papain-like protease (PL pro ) have been presumed critical for the viral replication of SARS-CoV. In this study, we focused on naturally derived tanshinones for inhibitory activity against both proteases. These compounds are abundant in the lipophilic fraction of S. miltiorrhiza extract. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the inhibitory effects of tanshinone against SARS-CoV main proteases. All of the isolated compounds 1-7 showed marked inhibitory activities to the 3CL pro and PL pro . The activity was significantly affected by subtle changes in structure. The IC 50 values of these inhibitors, although higher than those of peptide-derived and small molecule viral cysteine protease inhibitors, are nonetheless in the low micromolar range. In particular, seven compounds exerted significant PL pro inhibitory activity (range from 0.8 to 30.0 lM) and inhibition was improved preincubation with the PL pro . In addition, our detailed kinetic mechanism analysis of these species has unveiled that they all exhibit slowbinding inhibition with enzyme isomerisation and noncompetitive inhibitors with the exception of compound 7. Interestingly, the introduction of three-ringed abietane analog, 7, showed simple reversible slow-binding inhibitor and mixed-type inhibition. Furthermore, the potential usage and development of other novel inhibitors for PL pro and cellular deubitquitination enzyme (DUB) based on the isolated compounds is discussed in this study. Out of the tanshinones, tanshinone I (5) showed the most potent DUB activity with an IC 50 value of 0.7 lM. The results from this study warrant further investigation to examine the effect to these natural products on the inhibition of SARS-CoV. In an effort to advance this initiative, we sought to identify novel small molecules that specifically target SARS-CoV.",
