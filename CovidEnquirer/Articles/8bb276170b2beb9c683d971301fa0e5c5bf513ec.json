However, some NDV strains, such as Beaudette C (BC), may retain too much virulence in poultry for safe use, and more highly attenuated strains may be suboptimally immunogenic. We therefore modified the BC strain by changing the multibasic cleavage site sequence of the F protein to the dibasic sequence of avirulent strain LaSota. Additionally, the BC, F, and HN proteins were modified in several ways to enhance virus replication. These modified BC-derived vectors and the LaSota strain were engineered to express the hemagglutin (HA) protein of H5N1 highly pathogenic influenza virus (HPAIV). In general, the modified BC-based vectors expressing HA replicated better than LaSota/HA, and expressed higher levels of HA protein. Pathogenicity tests indicated that all the modified viruses were highly attenuated in chickens. Based on in vitro characterization, two of the modified BC vectors were chosen for evaluation in chickens as vaccine vectors against H5N1 HPAIV A/Vietnam/1203/04. Immunization of chickens with rNDV vector vaccines followed by challenge with HPAIV demonstrated high levels of protection against clinical disease and mortality. However, only those chickens immunized with modified BC/HA in which residues 271-330 from the F protein had been replaced with the corresponding sequence from the NDV AKO strain conferred complete protection against challenge virus shedding. Our findings suggest that this modified rNDV can be used safely as a vaccine vector with enhanced replication, expression, and protective efficacy in avian species, and potentially in humans.",

However, NDV strains that have a polybasic cleavage site in the F protein and an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI)>0.7 have been classified as Select Agents. Most mesogenic strains, including strain BC, fall into this category even though their pathogenic potential in chickens is limited. The Select Agent http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.06.061 0264-410X/\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. classification renders them impractical for vaccine development and use. Therefore, we have endeavored to develop NDV vaccine vectors that would be more effective than lentogenic strains and yet would have the avirulent phenotype. We further evaluated these new NDV vectors by using them to express the HA protein of H5N1 HPAIV. HPAIV is an economically important disease of poultry worldwide. In particular, HPAIV subtype H5N1 infections have resulted in the culling or death of more than 500 million poultry in more than 62 countries. Furthermore, H5N1 strains have been found to cause disease in humans. Therefore, vaccination of poultry or humans against HPAIV could play an important role in reducing virus shedding and raising the threshold for infection and transmission [9] . However, development of vaccines against HPAIV has been hampered due to poor immunogenicity of the virus [10] . The development and manufacture of HPAIV vaccines based on inactivated virus are costly due to the requirement of enhanced biosafety level 3 containment. Therefore, vaccine platforms that can avoid these shortcomings are needed. Live NDV vectors represent an alternative approach. Remarkably, our modified versions of the BC strain expressing the HA protein of H5N1 HPAIV were found to be avirulent by the ICPI test. We evaluated selected constructs for replication, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy in chickens. Our results showed that two of the modified vectors are superior to the commonly used rLaSota vector.",

This backbone was further modified by replacing various regions in the F gene with those of velogenic NDV strain AKO [8] or the complete HN protein gene of strain LaSota (Fig. 1A) . Particularly, we replaced the region of the F gene encoding amino acids 271-330, or 275-330, or 331-390 of rBC/Las Fc with the corresponding segment of the AKO strain. Strain AKO was chosen because this strain replicates to high titer in vitro and in vivo [15] . We chose these segments, because our preliminary work showed that these modifications enhanced virus replication and syncytium formation in vitro (data not shown). Consequently, this can also enhance the in vivo replication and immunogenicity of vaccine vectors. Infectious viruses were generated using a reverse genetics established in our laboratory [12] .",

Eight birds from each group were challenged with 10 4 ELD 50 of HPAIV strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 at 1 week post-immunization (wpi), and the remaining eight birds were challenged in the same way at 3 wpi. For the immunized control group, 3 birds were challenged 1 and 3 wpi. To monitor shedding of the challenge virus, oral and cloacal swabs were collected on days 4 and 7 post-challenge, inoculated into 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs, and confirmed by HA assay using chicken erythrocytes.

Specifically, the rBC-derived viruses reached 8 log 10 TCID 50 /ml at 24 hpi, whereas rLaSota and rLaSota/HA had titers of 6.5 and 5.4 log 10 TCID 50 /ml, respectively, at 24 hpi. The expression of HA by the rNDVs was evaluated in DF1 cells in the presence of 10% allantoic fluid. Despite the presence of the added protease, under these conditions HA was detected only as the uncleaved precursor (HA 0 , molecular weight of 66 kDa). The expression of the HA 0 protein could be detected at 12 h post-infection (hpi) in the case of three modified rNDVs (AKO F 271-330, AKO F 275-330, and Las HN) (Fig. 3A) . Subsequently, the expression of HA 0 was detected for all the rNDVs at 24 hpi. At 24 hpi, modified rNDV containing AKO F 331-390 or Las HN expressed higher levels of HA 0 than the other viruses.",

There was a two-fold increase in the incorporation of HA 1 protein into the vector particle for rNDV-Las HN/HA compared to rLaSota/HA.

Similar to the results with the Western blots, modified rNDV containing AKO F 271-330 or Las HN expressed higher levels of the HA protein on the surface of DF1 cells. Furthermore, this was quantitatively confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3D) . These results identified rNDV The pathogenicity of rNDVs expressing the HA protein was evaluated by the MDT and ICPI assays ( Table 1 ). The avirulent nature of rLaSota was not affected in either assay by expression of the HPAIV HA protein. The MDT values of the modified rNDVs expressing the HA protein were more than 90 h, and the ICPI values were 0.00, indicating that these modified rNDV vectors are avirulent in chickens.

Additionally, NDV has shown promising results as a potential vaccine vector for human use [18] [19] [20] . NDV is attractive as a vaccine vector in humans because it is highly attenuated in non-human primates, it is not a common human pathogen and is antigenically distinct from common human pathogens and thus should be unaffected by pre-existing immunity, and it can be given topically to the respiratory tract to induce both mucosal and systemic immunity. Although both lentogenic and mesogenic NDV strains can be used as vaccine vectors, the mesogenic strains are more easily grown in vitro and are more immunogenic in vivo. However, mesogenic strains might cause disease in poultry, and most strains are classified as Select Agents, which precludes their development as a vaccine vector. Therefore, we changed the polybasic F cleavage site of mesogenic strain BC to the dibasic F cleavage site of strain LaSota. It would eliminate one of the criteria in classifying BC as a Select Agent. We also confirmed that the recovered virus stably maintained modified F protein cleavage sites during seven passages in chickens. Since reversion of the F protein cleavage site sequence will require mutation of 11 nucleotides, there exists a distance possibility of reversion to virulence. Further, the genetic stability of the cleavage site sequence and virus attenuation need to be carefully evaluated with insertion of different foreign genes into this vaccine vector prior to its use in the field. In addition, we swapped regions of the F gene with strain AKO, or swapped the HN gene with rLaSota. This was done because the fusogenic activity of NDV can affect virus replication in vitro and in vivo, and its modulation can enhance the potential of rNDVs for use as vaccine vectors [21] . The resulting modified rBC viruses were found to be more restricted for replication than their rBC parent and were more immunogenic than rLaSota strain in 2-week-old chickens.",

There is a need to develop effective vaccines against HPAIV. Our results showed that all the modified rNDV/HA vectors were avirulent in 1-day-old chicks, with an ICPI value of 0.00. Thus, these vectors are not Select Agents and would not pose a threat to the poultry industry.",

Thus, these two modified rNDV/HA vectors were chosen for evaluation of immunogenicity and protective efficacy against H5N1 HPAIV in parallel with the LaSota/HA vector. Our immunization study showed that most serum samples from immunized chickens with the three rNDVs at 1 wpi had high levels of HI titers against NDV and HPAIV, suggesting that these vectors can be efficient as early as 1 wpi. At 3 wpi, titers of serum samples from all immunized chickens remained high. Subsequent challenge with HPAIV H5N1 showed that each of the vectors induced substantial protection against HPAIV challenge. Specifically, whereas all of the unimmunized chickens died by 2 dpc, all of the immunized chickens remained free of disease without replication of detectable infectious challenge virus in tissue samples. However, evaluation of tracheal and cloacal swabs taken at 4 and 7 dpc did reveal differences in the level of protection. Specifically, only the rNDV-AKO F 271-330/HA vector completely prevented detectable HPAIV shedding in all of the birds. The rNDV-Las HN/HA vector was the next most protective, with shedding detected in 2 swabs. The rLaSota/HA was the least protective, with shedding detected in 4 swabs. These results suggest that the two modified rNDV vectors can be more efficient in restricting replication of HPAIV challenge virus than the current rLaSota vector. Since virus shedding can transmit HPAIV to unvaccinated flocks and to humans, an ideal HPAIV vaccine should completely prevent any challenge virus replication and shedding. This suggests that the rNDV-AKO F 271-330/HA vector represents an improved H5N1 HPAIV vaccine for poultry.",

These rNDV vectors can replicate to higher levels in vitro and in chickens than the rLaSota virus, without causing any clinical signs. Our study has identified two improved rNDV vectors that induce higher levels of immunogenicity and protective efficacy against HPAIV. Whether these two rNDV vectors would also provide increased immunogenicity and protection against HPAIV in mammalian species remains to be identified.",
