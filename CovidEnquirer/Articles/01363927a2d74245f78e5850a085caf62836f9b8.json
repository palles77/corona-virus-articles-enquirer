Errors included nose clip not tightened (71%) and straps incorrectly placed (52%); 22% put on the respirator upside down. Factors independently associated with proper donning were as follows: ever having used a mask or respirator (odds ratio [OR] 5.28; 95% confi dence interval [CI], 1.79-22.64); ever having had a respirator fi t test (OR 4.40; 95% CI, 2.52-7.81); being male (OR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.50-4.03); Caucasian race (OR 2.09; 95% CI, 1.32-3.33); having a certifi ed respirator (OR 1.99, 95% CI, 1.20-3.28); and having participated in mold clean-up (OR 1.82; 95% CI,1.00-3.41).

A survey of 159 New Orleans area residents 7 weeks after Katrina found that 68% of those interviewed were aware of the recommendation (11) and that at least 30% of those participating in remediation activities had used a NIOSH-certifi ed respirator (12) . Despite these levels of awareness and experience, subsequent anecdotal reports suggested that some New Orleans residents were not properly donning N95 FF respirators. Improper donning would promote the entry of unfi ltered air through leaks or gaps between the respirator and the skin, compromising the protection offered (13) . To better understand respirator use by the public, we investigated the nonoccupational use and donning of N95 FF respirators in post-hurricane New Orleans.",

A participant with an N95 FF respirator that appeared to be in good condition was permitted to use this respirator for the evaluation. Otherwise, the participant was asked to choose between 2 models then available from New Orleans retailers. The interviewer asked the participant to put on the N95 FF respirator as he or she would for participating in mold clean-up activities.

Our fi ndings are of particular importance to public health agencies planning for future events, from fl oods to pandemic infl uenza, in which use of N95 FF respirators by the public will be recommended or is anticipated. A unique opportunity exists to enhance protection of the public through interventions, such as educational campaigns, training sessions, and respirator design modifi cations, aimed at improving the public's ability to don a respirator correctly. Infection control offi cers and the healthcare workers they protect also may benefi t from the insights gained from this survey. data acquisition; Hannah Alsdurf, Michael Beaty, Brent C.
