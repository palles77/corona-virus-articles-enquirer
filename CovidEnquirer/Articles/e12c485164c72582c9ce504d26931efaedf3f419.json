The automatic metric used in DUC is ROUGE (Lin, 2004) specifically, ROUGE-2, which calculates the overlap in bigrams between the peer and the four model summaries, and ROUGE-SU4, which calculates the bigram overlap, but allowing up to 4 words to be skipped in order to identify a bigram match. Automatic metrics are useful as they potentially allow a comparison between different system settings, as we show in Section 6.1. However, since we are primarily interested in maximizing the content of our system's summaries, which, due to many issues of semantic realization such as paraphrase, cannot always be captured by measuring bigram overlap with four model summaries, we also evaluate our results with human evaluation metrics. Human evaluation is time-consuming and must be conducted carefully, in the same experimental setting, in order to ensure comparison across systems. We participated in DUC2006 in order to gain access to a human evaluation of our system, specifically the NIST content responsiveness score. In addition, a second human evaluation is coordinated by Columbia University, the Pyramid method . The Pyramid method requires two steps: first, a set of semantic equivalence classes are built for the sets of model summaries, with higher scores assigned to content represented in multiple model summaries, and second, a person identifies the content units in a peer summary that are found in the set of semantic equivalence classes. 3 The scores reported measure the amount of content overlap between the peer summary and the four model summaries.",

The SumBasic algorithm is distinct from Luhn's algorithm, however, in several significant but illustrative ways. Luhn first collects the frequencies of words in the document and identifies a subset of significant words, excluding the most frequent (what would now be termed ''stopwords'') and the least frequent (generally, words occurring less than four times). Whereas SumBasic uses true initial probabilities and computes the weight of a sentence as equal to the average probability of the words in a sentence, Luhn treats all significant words as having equal weight and computes the weight of a sentence as a function of the concentration of significant words in the sentence. This weight is obtained by defining windows as sequences of significant and non-significant words, such that there are no more than four non-significant words between any two significant words in a window; the weight of a sentence is equal to the weight of the highest scoring window, namely, the square root of the number of significant words in the window, divided by the total number of words in the window. Finally, since Luhn's system is designed to summarize single-documents, there is little need to prevent redundancy, in sharp contrast to multidocument summarization, where the likelihood that several documents might convey highly similar, or even identical, important information necessitates mechanisms to avoid redundancy, a functionality that SumBasic provides by updating the probability of the words on the basis of preceding selected sentences.",

Thus, in order to incorporate topic constraints in generic summarization, our new system, called SumFocus, captures the information conveyed by the topic description by computing the word probabilities of the topic description. Having done so, the weight for each word is computed as a linear combination of the unigram probabilities derived from the topic description, with backoff smoothing to assign words not appearing in the topic a very small probability, and the unigram probabilities from the document, in the following manner (all other aspects of SumBasic remain unchanged):",

Columbia University's summarization system uses a syntactic simplification component (Siddharthan, Nenkova, & McKeown, 2004) the results of which are sent to their sentence clustering component. Daum\u00e9 and Marcu (2005a) employ a post-processing approach and report that deleting adverbs and attributive phrases improve ROUGE scores in the Multilingual Summarization Evaluation, although this post-processing was not found to be useful in DUC2005 (Daum\u00e9 & Marcu, 2005b) conceivably because the summaries are 250 words long rather than 100 words long.",

Unlike MDT, however, in our system both original and alternative simplified sentences are provided for selection without differentiation, i.e., without retaining any explicit link between them, under the assumption that the SumBasic-based multi-document summarization engine is inherently equipped with the ability to handle redundancy, and the simplified alternatives only add to that redundancy. SumBasic's method for updating the unigram probabilities given the sentences already selected allows the simplified sentence alternatives to be considered independently, while maintaining redundancy at a minimum. 5 Given that this approach to sentence simplification allows the sentence selection component to make the optimal decision among alternatives, we are thus freed to pursue more aggressive simplification, since the original non-simplified version is always available for selection. The approach is also extensible to incorporating novel sentence rewrites into a summary, moving in the direction of generative rather than extractive summaries. An example of this is Jing and McKeown (2000) who propose a set of operations to edit extracted sentences, not limited to sentence reduction. It is straightforward to integrate such sentence rewrite operations into our framework, as candidate generation works independently of sentence selection, and word probability alone suffices to compute the sentence score.",

Each sentence in the document cluster is first parsed using a broad-coverage English parser (Ringger, Moore, Charniak, Vanderwende, & Suzuki, 2004) . We then run a filter on the parse tree that eliminates certain nodes from the parse tree when the node matches the patterns provided heuristically. Table 1 lists the syntactic patterns used in our DUC2006 system. These patterns are inspired by and similar to those discussed in Dunlavy et al. (2003) the principal difference being that extraction makes use of a full-fledged syntactic parser rather than employing a shallow parsing approach. For the first three patterns in Table 1 (noun appositive, gerundive clause and non-restrictive relative clause), the parser returns a node label corresponding exactly to these patterns; we simply deleted the nodes with these labels. For the identification of intra-sentential attribution, we added specific conditions for detecting the verbs of attribution (said in Table 1 ), its subject (the report), the complementizer (that) and adverbial expressions if any, and deleted the nodes when conditions were matched. In the case of sentence-initial adverbials, we delete only manner and time adverb expressions, The return to whaling will be a sort of homecoming for the Makah, whose real name which cannot be written in English means ''people who live by the rocks and the seagulls''",

Starting with an initial dataset of 9.5 million sentences in $32,400 pre-clustered news articles, we created a monolingual bitext of $282,600 aligned sentence pairs using a crude heuristic similarity measure based on three criteria, namely, that the sentence pairs should have at least three words in common, have a minimum sentence length ratio of 66.6%, and have a word-based edit distance (i.e,, number of words inserted and deleted) of e 6 12.

No attempt was made to discriminate among word senses, in particular, where chaining might have resulted in mismatched terms. (In general, such mismatches would tend to have very low scores.)

It must be noted, however, that the maximum Pyramid score for each cluster differs since the agreement observed in the model summaries varies from cluster to cluster, and so we find that the average rank is a better method to compare systems, presented in Table 6 . System 10 is ranked first for 5 out of 20 clusters, and is in the top 3 for half of the clusters. Overall, our percluster mean ranking (5.90) is the best among the 22 systems. On the other hand, our performance across the 6 DUC reports ROUGE numbers that are computed implementing the ''jackknife'' in which each human model summary is successively removed from the evaluation and added to the system (''peer'') summaries. This permits the human summaries to be directly compared with the system summaries using the same metric. For all experiments in this paper, however, we compute ROUGE without jackknifing, which allows us to use 4 model summaries. As a result, the official DUC 2006 scores vary slightly from the numbers reported here; the differences, however, are not significant. clusters, also shown in Table 6 , is not evenly distributed; system 10 scores worse than half of the systems for 5 out of 20 clusters. Table 6 also presents the NIST content responsiveness score, i.e., the human judgment of how well the content responds to the needs expressed in the topic description, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is the highest achievable score. Overall, System 10 ranked third on responsiveness. On a per-cluster basis, providing a system ranking according the NIST content score is less than instructive since there are only 5 values that can be given. Initial investigation showed there is no correlation between Pyramid score and NIST content score, but we have reached no conclusion yet. It is unexpected that for cluster D0601, system 10 is ranked highest among the peers in the Pyramid evaluation, with a relatively high degree of SCU overlap, while receiving a poor NIST content score for the same cluster. Looking at the Pyramid analysis a bit more deeply, we also computed the percentage of the number of SCUs that were scored in System 10 and the number of SCUs that could be attained within the 250 word limit. We note that for only one cluster are more than half of the attainable SCUs found in System 10's peer summaries. Improving this percentage is a clear direction for future research, though it remains an open question whether improving this percentage will lead to higher content responsiveness scores.",

Manual investigation of the summary for one cluster (D0631D) established that four out of eleven sentences were non-simplified despite the availability of a simplified alternative. These four sentences are shown in Table 8 . Of these, two were incorrectly parsed as noun appositives, resulting in an unexpectedly large portion of the text being deleted and rendering the simplified version less likely to be selected. The other two sentences present interesting cases where the deleted portion of text (indicated in boldface in Table 8 ) included important content, corresponding to Summary Content Units (SCUs) observed in three or four of the model summaries according to the Pyramid evaluation. This manual examination confirms that the best simplification strategy may not be the same in all cases, and that there are benefits in using the summarizer itself to choose the best sentence alternative given the context.",

In part this may be because the parser-based simplification filter can produce ungrammatical sentences and sentences with degraded readability owing to misplaced punctuation marks. However, grammaticality judgments may also be affected by whether or not a system allows incomplete last sentences. Since the length limit in DUC2006 was 250 words, some systems kept the summaries below 250 words, but permitted only complete sentences, while other systems truncated the summary at 250 words, even if the last sentence was incomplete. SumFocus falls into this latter category. Only 2 systems allowing incomplete last sentences scored higher on grammaticality than those with complete last sentences, suggesting that while the low scores for grammaticality may be due to sentence simplification, they may also be a function of system design. Referential quality may also be negatively affected by the current simplification filter, since deletion of intrasentential attribution can result in deleting the antecedent of pronouns in the summary. On the other hand, it is encouraging to note that our methods perform well on non-redundancy and content responsiveness. In particular, providing sentence alternatives did not increase redundancy, even though the alternatives were not explicitly linked, indicating that the method of updating unigram weights given context used in SumFocus is robust enough to handle the greater redundancy introduced by providing simplified alternatives.",

Since the DUC2006 tasks constitute moderately extended queries, it is perhaps unsurprising that the expansions had minimal effect. It is likely also that system-related factors mitigated the impact of lexical expansions: for example, it is probable that the means by which the expansion scores were computed may have resulted in many word pairs being scored too low to have any effect, while the use of a uniform expansion k failed to differentiate different expansion types adequately.",
