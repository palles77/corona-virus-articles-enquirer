            "text": "Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy can occur in patients treated with the B cell depleting anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab, highlighting the importance of B cell surveillance of the central nervous system (CNS). The lymphoid chemokine, CXCL13, is critical for B cell recruitment and functional organization of peripheral lymphoid tissues, and CXCL13 levels are often elevated in the inflamed CNS. To more directly investigate the role of CXCL13 in CNS B cell migration, its role in animal models of infectious and inflammatory demyelinating disease was examined. During acute alphavirus encephalitis where viral clearance depends on the local actions of anti-viral antibodies, CXCL13 levels and B cell numbers increased in brain tissue over time. Surprisingly, however, CXCL13-deficient animals showed normal CNS B cell recruitment, unaltered CNS virus replication and clearance, and intact peripheral anti-viral antibody responses. During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), CNS levels of CXCL13 increased as symptoms emerged and equivalent numbers of B cells were identified among the CNS infiltrates of CXCL13-deficient mice compared to control animals. However, CXCL13-deficient mice did not sustain pathogenic anti-myelin T cell responses, consistent with their known propensity to develop more self-limited EAE. These data show that CXCL13 is dispensable for CNS B cell recruitment in both models. The disease course is unaffected by CXCL13 in a CNS infection paradigm that depends on a pathogen-specific B cell response, while it is heightened and prolonged by CXCL13 when myelin-specific CD4+ T cells drive CNS pathology. Thus, CXCL13 could be a therapeutic target in certain neuroinflammatory diseases, but not by blocking B cell recruitment to the CNS.",

CCL19 and CCL21 bind to CCR7 and recruit T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) to T cell areas of secondary lymphoid tissues (Yoshie et al., 1997; Muller et al., 2003) . CXCL12 binds to CXCR4 and attracts multiple immune cell types to lymph nodes and spleen, and along with CXCL13, drives the formation of germinal centers (Campbell et al., 2003; Allen et al., 2004) . CXCL13 is made by stromal cells in B cell follicles, and recruits both B cells and follicular helper T cells to these compartments by acting through its cognate receptor, CXCR5 (Forster et al., 1996; Legler et al., 1998; Ansel et al., 2000; Moser et al., 2002; Muller et al., 2003) . The expression of all lymphoid chemokines in both T and B cell areas of lymphoid organs depends on lymphotoxin (LT) a1b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling in stromal cells that are a main source of these chemoattractants (Mackay and Browning, 1998; Ngo et al., 1999; Fu and Chaplin, 1999) .",

During chronic inflammation of the synovium and salivary gland, ectopic structures resembling the T and B cell follicles of lymphoid organs have been observed (Hjelmstrom, 2001) . Evidence supporting a role for lymphoid chemokines in this process of ''lymphoid neogenesis\" derives in part from studies showing that transgenic expression of CCL21 or CXCL13 in organs such as the pancreas or thyroid gland is sufficient to cause leukocyte recruitment and the formation of lymphoid structures at these sites (Fan et al., 2000; Luther et al., 2000 Luther et al., , 2002 Chen et al., 2002; Martin et al., 2004) . CXCL13 is expressed in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid structures that develop in response to Helicobacter pylori infection (Mazzucchelli et al., 1999) , and has also been found in B cell aggregates that develop in the inflamed meninges of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and humans with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) (Magliozzi et al., 2004 (Magliozzi et al., , 2007 Serafini et al., 2004; Aloisi et al., 2008) . Such data have fueled interest in the role played by CXCL13 in local B cell recruitment during organ-specific infectious and autoimmune diseases (Lalor and Segal, 2010) .",

            "text": "Intrathecal accumulation of B cells and immunoglobulins (Ig) is a prominent feature of many infectious and inflammatory disorders of the CNS, even when ectopic lymphoid follicles have not been convincingly identified. In humans, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of CXCL13 are found not only in MS, but also in Lyme neuroborreliosis and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas (PCNSL) where the tumors are almost always of B cell origin (Krumbholz et al., 2006; Ljostad and Mygland, 2008; Fischer et al., 2009; Rupprecht et al., 2009; Sellebjerg et al., 2009) . In many of these settings, the magnitude of CXCL13 elevation correlates directly with the number of B cells present in the CSF sample (Krumbholz et al., 2006) , while successful treatment is associated with parallel declines of both CSF CXCL13 concentrations and CSF B cell numbers (Ljostad and Mygland, 2008; Fischer et al., 2009; Sellebjerg et al., 2009) . Still, the relative contribution of CXCL13 to recruiting CXCR5+ B cells into the CNS versus the coordinating their localization and interactions inside the CNS remains unresolved. One study in EAE showed that treating mice with a LTbR-Ig fusion protein that blocked LTa1b2 signaling could prevent the induction of CXCL13 in the meninges and stop the formation of organized B cell follicles at that site, but did not affect overall meningeal B cell migration (Columba-Cabezas et al., 2006) . Continued uncertainty regarding the role of CXCL13 in B cell recruitment to the inflamed CNS prompted us to more thoroughly investigate this question in two well-established animal models of neuroinflammation. Despite its induction in target tissues, we find that CXCL13 is dispensable for B cell recruitment to the CNS during both acute viral encephalitis and EAE, even though it may still be a therapeutic target in CNS autoimmune disease driven by CD4+ T cells.",

Although CXCL12 was constitutively found in na\u00efve brain samples, it was not increased by infection (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, CXCL13 levels rose steadily and were sustained in the brains of SV-infected mice over time compared to sham inoculated controls (Fig. 1B) . Interestingly, CXCL9 also did not increase with infection (Fig. 1C) , while CXCL10 levels rose quickly and then declined as peak brain inflammation developed (Fig. 1D) .

Induction of the lymphoid chemokine, CXCL13, is sustained in the brains of mice with SV encephalitis and is produced mainly by microglial cells in vivo. ELISA assays show that a related lymphoid chemokine, CXCL12, is not up-regulated in the brains of SV-infected compared to sham-inoculated mice (not significant (NS) by two-way ANOVA) (A). CXCL13 levels, however, increase and are sustained over the course of acute infection compared to controls (p < 0.0001 by two-way ANOVA) (B). A non-lymphoid chemokine previously implicated in CNS B cell recruitment, CXCL9, is not induced (NS by two-way ANOVA) (C), while another non-lymphoid chemokine previously implicated in this process, CXCL10, is quickly induced but not sustained in CNS tissue (p < 0.0001 by two-way ANOVA) (D). Quantitative PCR analysis of RNA extracted from FACS-sorted CNS cell populations shows that CXCL13 mRNA is found mostly in CD45 dim /CD11b+ (microglial) cells, and to a lesser extent in CD45 high /CD11b+ (infiltrating myeloid) cells following SV infection (E). Primary microglial cells produce CXCL13 following direct exposure to SV in vitro, while astrocytes do not respond in a similar manner ( * p < 0.05 by Student's t-test) (F). All bars represent the mean \u00b1 SEM of concentrations measured from at least triplicate samples. myeloid cells), and CD45 high /CD11b\u00c0 (infiltrating lymphoid cells) populations by flow cytometry. Quantitative PCR analysis of RNA isolated from each group of pooled cells revealed that CXCL13 mRNA was found primarily in microglia and to a lesser degree in infiltrating myeloid cells with limited expression in the lymphoid population (Fig. 1E) . When primary cultures of microglia and astrocytes were directly exposed to SV in vitro, microglia readily produced CXCL13 under these conditions, while astrocytes did not (Fig. 1F) . Conversely, synthetic TLR ligands provoked modest CXCL13 production by astrocytes and SV triggered the release of other inflammatory mediators by these cells (data not shown). Thus, microglia are the main source of CXCL13 in the brain during SV encephalitis, with infiltrating myeloid cells contributing modest amounts as well. Furthermore, this microglial production may be the result of direct exposure to the virus rather than being triggered by the actions of another mediator.",

B cells can be identified in this parenchymal infiltrate by immunostaining (Tyor et al., 1989) , and anti-viral antibodies act within the CNS to clear virus from infected neurons in a non-cytolytic manner (Levine et al., 1991; Griffin et al., 1997) . Virus-specific antibody-secreting cells arise in the spleens of SV-infected mice before appearing in the brain (Tyor and Griffin, 1993) . To further characterize CNS B cell infiltration during SV encephalitis, flow cytometry was used to investigate the expression of activation markers on peripheral B cells and to enumerate B cells within CNS MNC isolates derived from infected animals. These assays showed that a subset of both splenic and peripheral blood B cells become activated in the first 7 days after SV infection as evidenced by their increased expression of the activation marker, CD86 (Fig. 3A) . This peripheral activation occurs coincident with escalating MNC infiltration of the brain (Fig. 3B) . Phenotyping of the isolated brain MNC showed that B cells constitute a small but measurable fraction of the infiltrates ( Fig. 3C and D) . Prior studies of disease recovery have shown that while total B cell numbers decline in the CNS 3-4 weeks after SV infection (well beyond when infectious virus has been cleared from the brain), a small population is retained in the brain for many months thereafter and is highly enriched for those B cells producing anti-viral antibodies (Tyor et al., 1992; Griffin et al., 1997) . The present data show that B cells traffic into the brain during acute SV encephalitis in parallel to rising tissue levels of CXCL13.",

During active immunization EAE, the effects of CXCL13 deficiency were more apparent.

Because anti-viral antibodies are crucial to non-cytolytic clearance of SV from infected neurons (Levine et al., 1991; Griffin et al., 1997) , the serum neutralizing anti-viral antibody response was measured in both CXCL13 +/+ and CXCL13 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice at various time points following infection. Consistent with their capacity to clear virus normally from the CNS (Fig. 5) , CXCL13 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice mounted an early serum neutralizing antibody response equivalent to that measured in CXCL13 +/+ hosts (Fig. 6 ). Only at a late disease stage, well after infectious virus had been fully cleared from the CNS (Fig. 5) , did the systemic anti-viral antibody response wane slightly, but not significantly, in CXCL13 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice compared to CXCL13 +/+ controls (Fig. 6 ). This slight drop was not sufficient to allow any recrudescence of infection to occur (data not shown).

When MOG-specific Th1 and Th17 responses were quantified among peripheral lymphocytes from CXCL13 +/+ and CXCL13 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice following the induction of EAE, both subsets of encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells were found in equivalent numbers at peak disease (Fig. 7A) . Cells making two other T cell-derived cytokines, IL-2 and GM-CSF, in response to MOG peptide were likewise found at equivalent rates in these two hosts (Fig. 7A ). This indicates that CXCL13 does not influence T cell priming or differentiation in response to a myelin autoantigen. However, the frequencies of T cells making each of these four cytokines were significantly lower in the CXCL13 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice 2 weeks after peak disease was reached (Fig. 7B) . These waning pathogenic Th1 and Th17 responses in CXCL13 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice correspond with the known Fig. 3 . Peripheral B cells become activated and traffic to the CNS during acute SV encephalitis. Flow cytometry quantifies the proportion of CD19+ B cells in the spleen and peripheral blood expressing the known activation marker, CD86, over the course of acute infection (A). Total brain MNCs are simultaneously quantified from infected and sham-inoculated mice at three time points (B). Flow cytometry then determines the proportion of CD19+/CD45+ B cells (right panel) found among the cells present in the forward/side scatter lymphocyte gate (left panel) within the brains of SV-infected animals (C). The total number of B cells per brain is calculated as described in Section 2 (D). All bars represent the mean \u00b1 SEM of percentages or numbers measured from at least triplicate animals.",

Thus, while CXCL13 levels increase at the main sites of inflammation during both disorders (Figs. 1B and 2B) , its absence has no impact on either peripheral or CNS humoral responses during an infection model whose recovery depends primarily on this arm of the immune system (Figs. 4A and 6) . Flow cytometry enumerates B cells in the brains of CXCL13 +/+ and CXCL13 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice during SV encephalitis. Cell counts are normalized to a constant number of brain MNC cells to account for slight differences in the total amount of brain inflammation (A). Immunohistochemistry identifies occasional CD19+ B cells (arrow) in the spinal cords of CXCL13 +/+ mice at the peak of EAE symptoms (B). Quantification of labeled cells in cross sections of lumbar spinal cord shows no difference in the numbers of B cells detected between CXCL13 +/+ and CXCL13 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (C).

While CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may be the main effectors of immune surveillance in the normal CNS (Ransohoff et al., 2003) , B cells also contribute to this process. Studies in patients receiving B cell-depleting immunotherapies for the treatment of systemic autoimmune disorders or hematopoietic malignancies have shown them to be at increased risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a lethal encephalitis caused by the polyomavirus, JC virus (Carson et al., 2009; Gea-Banacloche, 2010) . In this setting, the systemic depletion of virus-specific B cells likely disrupts their ongoing recirculation through the brain where latent JC virus resides, thereby reducing the host's capacity to keep the pathogen in check and augmenting the risk of viral recrudescence. The molecular determinants through which B cells provide normal immune surveillance of the CNS remain unknown, and may or may not involve a chemokine-directed recruitment process.",

The B cells producing these antibodies are first detected in the spleens of infected animals before appearing in the brain (Tyor and Griffin, 1993) , although their need to physically traverse the BBB in order for antibodies to reach foci of infection is debatable. Indeed, prior studies have shown that the intravenous transfer of immune serum or monoclonal anti-viral antibodies is sufficient to promote viral clearance and recovery in SV-infected mice, provided that enough material is given (Stanley et al., 1986; Levine et al., 1991) . In this disease setting, the influx of B cells into the CNS may be more important to establish a local population of anti-viral effectors that are retained at that site well after viral clearance has been achieved in order to prevent late viral recrudescence (Tyor et al., 1992; Griffin et al., 1997) . By comparison to other viral encephalitis models, CXCL13 was not induced in the CNS during experimental coronavirus encephalomyelitis despite prominent accumulation of virus-specific antibody-secreting cells in the target tissue (Tschen et al., 2006) . Here, CXCL9 and CXCL10, both acting on plasmablasts through CXCR3, were implicated in CNS B cell recruitment (Tschen et al., 2006) . Our data would suggest that neither CXCL9 nor CXCL10 are likely responsible for B cell recruitment to the CNS of SV-infected animals, since one mediator (CXCL9) is simply not induced by infection and the other (CXCL10) only goes up transiently and then declines as B cell influx begins in earnest ( Fig. 1C and D) . Ongoing studies aim to investigate the role of other chemokines in CNS B cell recruitment in the SV encephalitis model.",

            "text": "The precise role of B cells in EAE pathogenesis depends on the model under investigation. Early studies in C57BL/6 mice showed that genetic deficiency of B cells had no effect on chronic disease triggered by the MOG 35-55 peptide, although B cell-deficient animals were resistant to EAE induced by the whole MOG protein (Hjelmstrom et al., 1998; Lyons et al., 1999) . Germline deletion of B cells also had little effect on a relapsing EAE model (Dittel et al., 2000) . More recently, however, very different effects on the clinical course of MOG-induced disease in C57BL/6 mice were observed when acute B cell depletion was undertaken at different intervals relative to disease initiation (Matsushita et al., 2008) . These findings led to the conclusion that B cells exert reciprocal roles in EAE pathogenesis; sometimes serving an immunoregulatory function while at other times actually helping to prime MOG-specific CD4+ T cells (Matsushita et al., 2008) . In both circumstances, however, these actions of B cells could readily occur outside the CNS and not require their passage across the BBB. Indeed, only in the more chronic phases of both EAE and MS are actual B cell aggregates found in the CNS, and then only in the meninges surrounding the parenchyma (Magliozzi et al., 2004 (Magliozzi et al., , 2007 Serafini et al., 2004; Aloisi et al., 2008) . CXCL13 is present in these B cell aggregates (Magliozzi et al., 2004 (Magliozzi et al., , 2007 Serafini et al., 2004; Aloisi et al., 2008) , so its primary role may be to help form ectopic lymphoid follicles rather than to actually recruit B cells into the CNS. The therapeutic benefit of disrupting these follicles via CXCL13 neutralization is unclear; in the non-obese Fig. 7 . MOG-specific T cell cytokine production in CXCL13 +/+ and CXCL13 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice during active immunization EAE. ELISpot assays were used to enumerate the number of splenic T cells producing each cytokine ex vivo following stimulation with MOG 35-55 . At peak disease, cells producing both IFN-c (Th1) and IL-17 (Th17) were present in equivalent numbers in both hosts (A). Two weeks later, both Th1 and Th17 responses had waned in the CXCL13 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice compared to the CXCL13 +/+ controls. * p < 0.05 by Student's t-test for the indicated cytokines compared to CXCL13 +/+ controls. All bars represent the mean \u00b1 SEM of numbers measured from at least triplicate samples. diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type-1 diabetes, such an action prevented ectopic follicle formation in the pancreas but had no effect on diabetes progression (Henry and Kendall, 2010) . The pathogenic significance of these lymphoid structures in experimental and human demyelinating disease awaits further study.",

How this happens remains poorly understood, although CXCL13 acts to position lymphocytes and DCs within T and B cell zones in lymphoid organs (Forster et al., 1996; Legler et al., 1998; Ansel et al., 2000) , so it may serve a similar function within the CNS. One study suggested that CXCL13 could be an important effector that brings CD11c+ DCs and autoreactive CXCR5+ T cells together, increasing the likelihood of the cognate interactions that drive EAE (Bagaeva et al., 2006) . Since CD11c+ DCs are an important source of CXCL13 in this disorder, and since most of the CXCR5+ cells found in CNS infiltrates are CD3+ T cells, the absence of CXCL13 may prevent sufficient numbers of myelin-specific T cells from reactivating to sustain disease beyond its initial stages (Bagaeva et al., 2006) . This makes CXCL13 a potential therapeutic target in autoimmune demyelination of the CNS, but for reasons other than altered B cell recruitment into the target tissue. Further studies are required to clarify its role in EAE and related disorders.",
