Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) have been found to be the natural reservoir from which the viral spill-over to humans can occur. Camels show no or minor clinical signs if infected with MERS-CoV [2] . As of the end of February 2019, 2374 laboratory confirmed human cases worldwide, including 823 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 34.6%), have been reported. The majority of these cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (1983 cases, including 745 related deaths) [3] . In Qatar, a total of 24 human cases have been reported along with 8 related deaths. At the beginning of the MERS outbreak in 2012, the lack of knowledge, particularly on the mode and speed of transmission of this novel virus, challenged the healthcare systems in Qatar as well as the entire Gulf region, amid fears that transmission could readily happen between humans. The unfamiliarity of the responding agencies of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) with such an extraordinary threat heightened the concerns of the affected communities in Qatar as MERS cases continued to be reported from all neighbouring GCC countries. Moreover, the GCC countries are characterised with intensive movement of people and camels across the borders.",

MERS-CoV was detected from nasal swabs of three camels with which the patients had contact [4] .

The OCT played a fundamental role in the national response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Influenza (H1N1) virus pandemic in 2009. The new OCT involved multidisciplinary and multisectoral representation primarily from the MoPH and the Ministry of Municipality and Environment (MME) in Qatar. To develop a coherent investigation and response strategy, the MoPH leaders decided to support the OCT with technical expertise from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC), Public Health England (PHE), and Erasmus Medical Centre (EMC) in the Netherlands.",

Whenever a human case was suspected with MERS infection, a patient investigation was conducted, which included contact tracing, work and movement of the patient and history of camel contact. If the patient had direct or indirect camel contact, the RRT informed their veterinary counterpart. The veterinary team tested the camels around the patient. The public health team tested all human contacts around the patient. Later on, a complete report of that patient was prepared. Based on these reports, a complete One Health approach was developed and implemented. At least 3 MERS cases were detected during routine case investigations and contact tracing at the community settings.",

The outcome of joining forces in carrying out these studies was outstanding. First and foremost it helped facilitate the access of the joint RRT to the camel barns and the farms hosting race camels. Collection of samples and data of camels and their caregivers became easier, allowing a series of subsequent fundamental epidemiological, veterinary and clinical studies to take place. Through these studies it was possible to provide the first global molecular evidence that camels are a potential source for MERS-CoV [4] . The door was opened to a number of research studies that ensued thereafter to yield insights into some essential aspects of MERS-CoV. While some studies focused on exposure to camels and the husbandry practices, others addressed the mode of transmission to humans, and possible risk factors [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .

As the epidemic evolved and the OCT reactivated, the workload to diagnose human or camel specimens gradually increased. Joint training activities for both human and animal labs were organized on lab detection of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV sample storage and the test capacity in both human and veterinary laboratories were scaled up. A network including international reference laboratories was initiated and this alliance is maintained to date to tackle other zoonotic diseases like Influenza, Rabies etc. To improve coordination and communication, a focal person was assigned from human and veterinary laboratories to ensure timely data and sample sharing.",

As camels infected with MERS only show asymptomatic or mild respiratory tract disease, camel owners and workers doubted the link between camels and the disease. Moreover, the veterinarians showed insufficient interest in mounting a large scale outbreak operation similar to the one initiated by the public health sector, as they have a shortage of technical guidance on surveillance and other technical areas including laboratory tools and diagnostic kits. The One Health approach needed more local and international support to ensure a systematic and sustained implementation. Furthermore, one study on risk perception suggested that some camel owners have poor risk perception of MERS [15] . Additionally, both public health and veterinary sectors were accustomed to work in a solo vertical way and only occasionally engaged with each other in short term research projects. Apart from the SARS and H1N1 epidemics, the two sectors worked independently, making joint technical work a difficult task. Therefore, the livestock sector did not appear to feel the same pressure as the public health sector. However, further studies are required to explore areas for improvement to ultimately make the One Health approach more appealing to all sectors involved.",

Although capabilities and funding were unequal between the public health and the veterinary sector, the available competencies, supported with a substantial political will to join efforts and improve coordination, were sufficient to jointly address MERS-CoV. The adopted inter-sectorial collaboration for surveillance has been vital to obtain a better understanding of MERS-CoV in Qatar. Obtaining the reliable evidence about transmission between camels and humans could have never been achieved without the prompt and timely joint investigation. Building local One Health technical capacity to investigate and confirm MERS-CoV in humans and animals helped the early detection of cases in humans and animals. Such practices minimized the time and costs for public health control measures.",

The unexpected disruption of the GCC countries undoubtedly hindered an effective regional collaboration in sharing data and carrying out sequencing studies. International agencies are required to call upon them to consider the One Health approach building on the Qatar experience which displayed a practical way of sharing resources and avoiding obstacles to work in the Arabian community. Establishing a regional committee for coordination and emergency risk communication is an important element to build capacities required for zoonosis control. We suggest that a regional 'One Health Centre of Excellence (OCE)' would help to develop unified standards and integrative guidelines for control of zoonoses including MERS-CoV.",
