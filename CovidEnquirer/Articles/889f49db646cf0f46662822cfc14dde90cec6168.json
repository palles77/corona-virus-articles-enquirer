Using nonparametric tests there were significant decreases in the CD45+, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ and CD16/56+ counts over each of the five weeks of the SARS illness compared to healthy controls, although the CD4+/CD8+ ratio did not change significantly over the course of the illness. The various lymphocyte populations (CD45+, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+) were below the normal ranges in the first week of the clinical illness, reaching a nadir during the second week before returning towards normal levels. There were significant differences in lymphocyte subset counts between weeks 1 and 2, weeks 2 and 3, weeks 4 and 5, and weeks 1 and 5 (Table 1) (Figures 1-3) . These observations are further defined in Table 2 where the CD45+, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ and CD16/56+ counts on samples collected daily during the first 21 days of SARS are listed. The total, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphopenia was most marked at days 7-9 in the second week of the illness. In Table 3 the lymphocyte subpopulation counts were compared between those with severe SARS (260 samples from 149 patients), non-severe SARS (436 samples from 122 patients), and those that recovered (613 samples from 246 cases) or died (48 samples from 25 patients) from SARS.

Total lymphocyte counts decreased in the first two weeks of illness (the nadir was in week 2) before increasing in the third week and returning to normal levels by the fifth week. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (CD45+, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) were quantitated by dynamic methods in a large cohort of 271 laboratory-proven cases of SARS. This study confirms observations of lymphopenia noted in most other series of SARS cases. 4, 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] A study in Hong Kong reported an absolute lymphopenia (<1000 \u00c2 10 6 /L) in 98% of patients during the course of their illness, most marked in the second week. 11 The data discussed here extend these observations (and provide the first data from mainland China), showing that the total lymphocyte counts of SARS patients were lower than those of normal individuals throughout the clinical course, and that this was more marked in severe disease compared to less severe illness, and in those who died compared to the survivors. A study of 75 patients from the Amoy Gardens outbreak in Hong Kong did not find an association of total lymphocyte counts and progression to ventilatory support and intensive care, 10 although there are differences in the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), oxygen saturation and gastrointestinal symptoms in these two cohorts. However, an association of lymphopenia with more severe disease was seen in another cohort of SARS cases from Hong Kong. 6 In contrast with other series of adult SARS cases, in the study reported here all patients had laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV infection. In two series totalling 25 children with probable or suspect SARS (although only four children had laboratory-proven SARS), total lymphopenia was common and more prominent in older children with more severe disease. 13, 14 Lymphocyte subsets (CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ and CD16/56+) were also counted in all patients. A significant CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lymphopenia has been observed in the first two weeks of the SARS illness in 31 patients, 11 but in this study, a more prolonged CD4+ and CD8+ lymphopenia was noted. CD4+ and CD8+ cells fell by approximately one half in the second week of the illness before returning to near normal by the end of week 5. In addition, patients with more severe disease had lower counts that took longer to rise. The data show that the CD4+ and CD8+ counts were lower in more severely ill patients and in those that died. The CD4+/CD8+ ratios were not significantly different in the various patient groups. CD19+ B lymphocytes were the first lymphocytes to numerically recover after two weeks and their recovery was associated with the appearance of SARS-CoV specific IgG and IgM. CD16/56+ NK cells also began to decrease in the first week (although there was a rise in NK cells towards the end of week 1) to their lowest levels during week 4, and had not returned to normal by week 5.",

Total and subset lymphopenia occurs in other acute (e.g. measles, cytomegalovirus) and chronic (e.g. HIV) viral infections in humans and animals, but lymphopenia has not been a feature of other human coronavirus infections in adults. [15] [16] [17] Lymphopenia has been described in some cases of experimental coronavirus 229E infections in humans. 18 A possible reason for the lymphopenia may be that lymphocytes are directly infected and destroyed by SARS-CoV. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has been identified as a functional cellular receptor for the SARS-CoV, a protein that is not expressed on B or T lymphocytes. 19, 20 This would suggest that direct viral invasion and destruction of lymphocytes is not a major cause of the acute lymphopenia in SARS, but this requires further study.",

Apoptosis has been observed in vitro in measles-induced lymphopenia, 22 and coronavirus 229E can cause in vitro apoptosis in monocytes/macrophages. 23 Whether different strains of SARS-CoV have variable effects on immune responses and clinical disease (as occurs with experimental measles in macaques) 24 is unknown. It is possible that the SARS-CoV-induced immune suppression predisposes to secondary infections, especially in the more severely ill patients, and it is unknown if there are any longer term effects on humoral or cell-mediated immunity following SARS.",
