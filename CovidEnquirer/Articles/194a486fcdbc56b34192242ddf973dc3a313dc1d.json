Patient presented with pneumonia and showed nonspecific signs and symptoms of mild illness. This undoubtedly increased the difficulty of early protective preparation for operating room personnel. Therefore, in containing the spread of 2019-nCoV in health-care settings, the Department of Anesthesiology, Wuhan Union Hospital has drafted a guideline for 2019-nCoV-related prevention and control, including emergency intubation, preoperative evaluation and infection control in the operating rooms. Furthermore, we aim to describe clinical features and anesthesia-related characteristics of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and suspected cases after emergency intubation and surgical anesthesia.",

Isolation of a novel coronavirus (CoV) from patients in Wuhan had been completed by theChinese scientists. It was a novel betacoronavirus and named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 4 . As of Jan 30, 2020, a total of 9692 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections were reported in China, of whom 213 have died and with 1527 severe cases 5 . Chaolin Huang and colleagues 2 reported clinical features of the first 41 laboratory-confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infections in Wuhan by Jan 2, 2020. Clinical manifestations were very similar to SARS-CoV. Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients. Patients with severe illness developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, oxygen therapy and endotracheal intubation. Concurrently, human-to-human transmission was confirmed by Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan and colleagues 6 and the recently documented infections in hospital staff caring for patients with 2019-nCoV 7 . Unfortunately, 15 hospital staff members, some of whom were working in the same ward, have been confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Union Hospital 4 , although the possible role of so-called super-spreaders remain to be clarified.",

After adopting these above-mentioned procedures, four hospitals have completed a total of 321 cases of emergency surgical anesthesia, of which 37 patients were laboratory-confirmed or suspected with 2019-nCoV.

In addition, we reported the clinical and anesthesia-related characteristics of 2019-nCoV patients in four most affected hospitals in Wuhan, China.

This has challenged healthcare workers to use effective infection control procedures and measures. Anesthesiologists, as specialists in airway management, generally undergo endotracheal intubation in severe cases for hypoxia and provides emergency anesthesia for surgery in these cases. This undoubtedly increases the exposure risk for anesthesiologists because of frequent exposures to patients' respiratory secretions and blood. Therefore, 2019-nCoV specific anesthesia guidelines need to be developed and used to avoid nosocomial spread of the virus.",

            "text": ". But it exhibited infectious characteristics during the incubation period (1-14-day medical observation period)7 . Transmission of 2019-nCoV probably occurs by means of large droplets and contact, and less so by means of aerosols and fomites. Meanwhile, exposure to oral and respiratory secretions at the time of endotracheal intubation will put anesthesiologists at high risk for infection. Therefore, all anesthesiologists who may be in contact with 2019-nCoV patients must take level 3 protective measures, detailed information is provided in Supplementary Materials. WHO have also released important information that prompted healthcare workers caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV to re-examine the precautionary procedures of infection control 4 .Diagnosis before entering the operating room is very important as well. The body temperature, laboratory findings (especially lymphocyte count) and chest x-ray and CT findings (especially multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity) should be confirmed before entering the operating room. If the patient has a fever with unknown cause, the examination results show pulmonary infection or low oxygen saturation of unknown cause (SPO 2 < 90%), and the surgery is not an emergency case, anesthesiologists should communicate with the patient, family and the surgeon to suspend the surgery. During anesthesia induction and surgery, close attention should be paid to heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation especially.To prevent cross-infection in the operating rooms, single-use of all anesthetic equipment, utensils and drugs for each patient must be guaranteed. Anesthetic devices in contact with the respiratory tract, such as video laryngoscope lenses, plastic respiratory pipes, filters, respiratory balloons, suction tubes, and sputum suction tubes should be discarded after single use. Meanwhile, thorough disinfection and sterilization of the operating room should be conducted at the end of the operation day or immediately after the surgery suspected 2019-nCoV cases. The sterilization includes routine disinfection of the anesthesia machine, whole operating room ultraviolet radiation, disinfectant spray and mopping. All these procedures should be inspected by the infection control team for backtracking purposes. In addition, healthcare workers who are routinely exposed to viral respiratory infections in the hospital may transmit infection to others15 . Potentially contaminated clothing worn back to the operating room by healthcare workers cannot be ignored as well. Thus, transmission-preventive protocols and disinfection measures should be properly followed before entering the operating room after intubation, consultation or postoperative patient transportation in the areas suspected of 2019-nCoV infection. It is forbidden to take any potentially contaminated clothing back to the operating room.Additionally, if healthcare workers develop the symptoms like fever, cough, soreness and feebleness etc. after contact with suspected/confirmed cases, evaluations such as blood test, C-Reactive Protein and pulmonary imaging should be timely acquired. If the following criteria are met, they should immediately report to the hospital and isolate themselves at home, even without direct contact with suspected/confirmed cases. Their vital signs and health conditions will be closely monitored, and they should receive proper diagnosis and treatment if their symptoms get worse.Despite a series of precautionary measures suggested by our institutional guidelines, it is still difficult to consider all possible problems encountered in clinical practice.Questions concerning best practice remain. A low infection rate in operating rooms in four hospitals were demonstrated after following strict guidelines of infection control procedures. We believe that these protective measures are effective when rigorously applied and that this is responsible for the relatively low infection rate amongst our healthcare workers.ConclusionsIn summary, public health measures and precautions in health care settings are critical in controlling 2019-nCoV. The current study may prevent cross-infection in the operating rooms by means of implementing anesthesia and infection control management procedures for emergency procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV. Institution of similar measures might be important and, it is hoped, successful in reducing the nosocomial transmission of 2019-nCoV in the perioperative settings.",
