            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a new viral atypical pneumonia. This infectious disease originated in Southern China and Hong Kong in late 2002, and then rapidly spread to over 25 countries. 1 The most common symptoms of SARS are cough, high fever (>38\u00b0C), chills, rigor, myalgia, headache, dizziness, as well as progressive radiographic changes of the chest and lymphopenia. The disease had a quite high mortality rate (up to 15-19%) during the initial outbreak. Death may result from progressive respiratory failure owing to alveolar damage. In early 2003, a novel human coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of SARS, and the virus was named SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). 2 To date, no effective antiviral drug or vaccine has been marketed for treating SARS, although steroid and ribavirin have been used empirically in hospitals of Hong Kong, 3, 4 and an HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir could decrease the replication of SARS CoV in a preliminary in vitro examination. 5 From the viewpoint of drug design, the human CoV main protease should be an attractive target due to its importance in the cleavage of the CoV polyprotein to the functional polypeptides. 6 Previous studies have reported that the structure and the active site of human CoV main protease or CoV 3C-like protease (CoV 3CL pro ) resemble those of picornavirus 3C protease. 6, 7 One of the human rhinovirus (a subtype of picornavirus) 3C protease inhibitor, 1 (AG7088), was previously suggested as a good potential lead compound for the development of SARS CoV 3CL pro inhibitor. 7 However, AG7088 failed to inhibit SARS CoV 3CL pro in vitro at this and other laboratories. 8 Recently, some peptide derivatives have been reported as active inhibitors against SARS CoV 3CL pro . 9a,9b Several types of small molecules screened from various chemical libraries have been identified as potent SARS coronavirus protease inhibitors with IC 50 values in low micro molar ranges. 9a,9c-9g However, some of these small molecules may be unsuitable for structural modification because of having complex structures (e.g., sabadinine). 9c Consequently, innovative scaffolds, which are easy to synthesize and chemically modify must be explored. In this report, preliminary works in the synthesis and evaluation of isatin derivatives as effective SARS CoV 3CL pro inhibitors investigated in our laboratories are described.",

N-Alkylation of the corresponding isatin 3, sodium hydride, and various bromide compounds (transformed from the corresponding alcohol or methyl derivatives) in DMF provided the desired compounds 4a-z as shown in Scheme 1. 11 Moderate yields (30-60%) were achieved depending on the substituted groups in isatin.",

The carbonyl group of isatin and the NH groups in Cys145, Ser144, and Gly143 of protease were hydrogen bonded. On the other hand, steric effect in isatin scaffold is crucial for ensuring inhibitory potency. Therefore, the inhibitors with a bulkier side chain (4u-z) are less potent than compound 4o because of the limited space between the R 4 of isatin and the His164 and Met165 of protease. Computational studies also demonstrated that the inhibitory potency depended heavily on hydrophobicity and electron affinity of the substituted groups in isatin. For example, compounds with nonpolar and more electron withdrawing groups such as bromo and nitro in R 3 (4i and 4k) are significantly more potent than the compound with an amino group in R 3 (4j). 12a The mixture of SARS CoV 3CL pro (50 nM), various concentrations of the compound (from 0 to 20 lM), and a pH 7.5 buffer containing Tris-HCl (12 mM), NaCl (120 mM), EDTA (0.1 mM), DTT (1 mM), b-ME (7.5 mM) was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Fluorogenic substrate (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans, 6 lM) was added. The fluorescence change resulted from the reaction was measured by continuous monitoring with Fusion-Alpha Basic Domestic System (excitation at 330 nm, emission at 515 nm). The initial velocities of the inhibited reactions were plotted against the different inhibitor concentrations to obtain the IC 50 . Table 2 shows that both isatin 4k and 4o exhibited more potent inhibition for SARS CoV 3CL pro than for other proteases such as papain (90-105 times) and trypsin (243-369 times). However, isatin 4k inhibited chymotrypsin at unexpectedly low IC 50 value compared with compound 4o (10.4 lM vs 1.00 mM). Consequently, 4k is less specific for SARS CoV 3CL pro than 4o. Computer docking of compound 4o has slightly better (0.2 kcal/ mol) binding affinity for SARS CoV 3CL pro . The slight difference might be the reason that compound 4o is more specific than compound 4k for other proteases.",

The structures of isatin derivatives were built in CAChe (Fujitsu, Japan) and refined by performing an optimized geometry calculation in Mechanics using augmented MM2 parameters and stored in PDB format. MGL-TOOLS (MGL, Scripps Institute) was used for structure preparation and parameter creation to meet the input requirements of Autodock. Briefly, essential hydrogen atoms were added to the model structure of 3CL protease (chain A) along with Kollman united atom charges, and solvation parameters. Molecules were added all-hydrogen atoms, assigned Gasteiger-Marsili charges, 16 merge nonpolar H atoms, and defined torsions",
