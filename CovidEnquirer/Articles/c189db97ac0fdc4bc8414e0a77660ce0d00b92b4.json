The sensitivity and specificity of published herd definitions for PMWS were tested on the study farms to consider the role of PCV2 in PMWS. Herds were defined as PMWS-affected, -unaffected or -recovered based on current and past postweaning mortality (PWM), grower pigs with clinical signs of rapid wasting, hairiness and pallor and no other known cause of death on the farm. PCV2 antigen and antibody were not used in the definition of PMWS. In each PMWS-affected herd, up to three sick pigs with the clinical signs above and one healthy pig of a similar age were taken for postmortem examination (PME). In all other herds at least one healthy pig was taken for PME. Lymph nodes were analysed for PCV2 antigen and histological changes, and serum samples were analysed for PCV2 antibody.",

There was no association between the presence of high scores of PCV2 antigen in pigs and the presence of high PWM in herds. PCV2 antigen score was significantly higher in sick than healthy pigs within farms, and high PCV2 score was associated with giant cells, coalescence and absence of germinal centres in lymph nodes. These results did not vary by PMWS-affected, -unaffected or -recovered farms. PCV2 antigen was present at high scores in approximately 10% of healthy pigs on all farms. All three herd definitions of PMWS were highly sensitive, defining PMWS-affected herds as affected, but had a specificity ranging from 23% to 43%.",

Linking this with the knowledge that the herd breakdowns occurred in a space time epidemic indicates that another infectious co-factor may be necessary for disease to occur. \u00df",

The disease is characterised by wasting, pallor and occasional jaundice in nursery and fattening pigs . Morbidity and mortality were 5-30% and close to 100%, respectively (Albina et al., 2001) . PMWS is now a pig disease of global importance . PMWS was first reported in Great Britain (GB) in 1999. PMWS has been reproduced by direct contact of healthy pigs with PMWS affected pigs (Albina et al., 2001) , indicating that it is an infectious disease. Analyses of patterns of spread of PMWS between farms within Denmark and within GB indicate that it is a new disease, most likely caused by a single infectious agent (Vigre et al., 2005; Woodbine et al., 2007) .",

There is now evidence that PCV2 was circulating in pig populations free from PMWS well before PMWS was first reported (Sandvik et al., 2001) and in countries free from PMWS (Pensaert et al., 2001) . There is no experiment that consistently fits Koch's postulate that PCV2 demonstrably causes PMWS disease in pigs Harms et al., 2001; Fenaux et al., 2002; Pensaert et al., 2004) . The most reproducible disease occurs when non-infectious immunostimulants or co-infections (e.g. porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus) are given to experimental piglets together with PCV2 (Allan et al., , 2003 Magar et al., 2000; Botner et al., 2001; Krakowka et al., 2000 Krakowka et al., , 2001a Rovira et al., 2002) . Recent research has proposed that only certain genetic variants of PCV2 may cause disease (Opriessnig et al., 2006) , but again the evidence for this is not strong.",

The case definition for an infectious disease should apply to individual hosts rather than a population and ideally include a sufficient and necessary cause. The case definition for PMWS is still unresolved. All definitions to date define affected herds, rather than pigs, and include the presence or score of PCV2 antigen. There are six definitions for herd-level PMWS. Sorden (2000) uses enlarged lymph nodes, progressive dyspnoea, diarrhoea, pallor, jaundice and wasting, depletion of lymphoid tissue and high scores of PCV2 virus in a group of up to six pigs. Additions to this definition include a history of raised mortality on affected farms (Rose et al., 2003; Segales et al., 2005;  pcvd.org), pigs with characteristic but non-specific signs of sudden wasting and pallor and no other known aetiological agent involved (Woodbine et al., 2007) and farm to farm spread of PMWS (consultative committee for emergency animal diseases Anon, 2005) .

Raised postweaning mortality from an unknown cause was included in the definition of PMWS as it was likely to be reliably recalled because of the impact of PMWS on farm profitability and staff morale. In 2004, PMWS was the one syndrome causing unexplained raised postweaning mortality, so it seems likely that PMWS was the main cause of mortality on these farms. In addition, all but one farmer involved their veterinarian in investigations of raised postweaning mortality, suggesting that it was a real effect. The selection of sick pigs with signs of wasting, pallor and hairiness was used because these are the key clinical signs of PMWS, and were easy to recognise. The selection of healthy pigs from PMWS-affected andunaffected farms gave two types of control (within and between herd classification of PMWS) that enabled us to investigate PCV2 diagnostic tests in sick and healthy pigs from both PMWS-affected and -unaffected herds. The detection of PCV2 antigen and antibody were deliberately omitted from the study definition of PMWS because of the confusing evidence from published challenge experiments. The definition of affected herds is supported by an analysis of geographical position and time of breakdown, which indicated a space-time clustered epidemic likely to be caused by a single pathogen (Woodbine et al., 2007) .",

This was also true for the other herd case definitions for PMWS that were tested, because PCV2 is used in all earlier case definitions of PMWS (Sorden, 2000; Rose et al., 2003) .",

Herd level causality is a combination of individual processes plus the population level processes which define the similarity between individuals. In the case of PMWS, it has been easier to define excess postweaning mortality in herds and there are no unique clinical signs in individual pigs, and thus a herd level case definition has arisen. We have demonstrated that the herd definitions that exist are not accurate for defining herds with PMWS. Inclusion of PCV2 antigen in the case definition greatly reduces the specificity of the diagnostic tests. In addition, an individual-based case definition (i.e. the actual pigs that are affected) remains elusive. This needs refining so that we can accurately define pigs and consequently herds and countries with PMWS. Consequently, we cannot currently (in 2008) accurately define the PMWS-status of individual pigs or herds. We have an incomplete case definition based on postweaning mortality, wasting and pallor in affected pigs and absence of other known pathogens.",

At mid antigen scores there were high antibody titres, possibly containing the virus. However, at high antigen scores the antibody titres were low, indicating insufficient free antibody to contain the virus and that the immune system was overwhelmed.
