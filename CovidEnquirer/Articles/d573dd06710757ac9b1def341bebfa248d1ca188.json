The many complex functions of the liver are reflected in a multitude of pathophysiologic derangements that occur with hepatic disease. An understanding of these derangements is necessary for accurate interpretation of laboratory tests, making clinical decisions regarding further diagnostic tests, and determining management of the patient. A brief discussion of some of the important pathophysiologic abnormalities is included at the beginning of this chapter. Recent advances in noninvasive imaging of the liver and biopsy methods have made hepatic biopsy a routine and essential tool in the management of patients with hepatic disease. This can lead to a definitive diagnosis, which allows the clinician to make appropriate decisions regarding management.",

Bilirubin is formed primarily from breakdown products of red blood cells, from other hemoproteins, and other enzymes such as the cytochromes. Red blood cells have a finite life span (usually 120 days in the dog, 90 days in the cat), after which they are removed from the circulation by the body's reticuloendothelial system (especially in the spleen and liver). In the Kupffer's cells of the liver, senescent red blood cells are degraded to free hemoglobin. Similarly, circulating hemoglobin bound to several carrier proteins is phagocytized by Kupffer's cells. The enzyme heme oxygenase catabolizes hemoglobin to biliverdin, which is then converted to bilirubin by the enzyme biliverdin reductase. This lipidsoluble free bilirubin crosses the cell membrane and is released into the circulation, where it is bound to albumin. This circulating complex (termed unconjugated or indirect bilirubin) is eventually actively taken up by hepatocytes. Bilirubin is then bound to intracellular carrier proteins and undergoes conjugation, primarily with glucuronide. Conjugated bilirubin (also called direct bilirubin) is secreted into the bile canaliculus and transported to the gallbladder for storage.",

Conjugated bilirubin, however, is freely filtered and appears in the urine and is readily detected with urine dipsticks. The dog has a very low renal threshold for conjugated bilirubin excretion; thus urine concentration of bilirubin increases far more readily than plasma concentration. It is normal to find a small amount of bilirubin in the urine of dogs, especially in a concentrated sample. Therefore there must be a considerable increase in the bilirubin load to increase plasma concentrations. Slight elevations in plasma bilirubin are significant, suggesting hepatobiliary disease. In the cat the renal threshold is much higher, so the finding of any degree of bilirubinuria is always abnormal. Renal tubular cells of the dog also possess a limited ability to convert hemoglobin into unconjugated bilirubin, which then appears in the urine.

Delta-bilirubin is a novel form of bilirubin first noticed when the sum of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin was less than the total bilirubin concentration when measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The difference has been attributed to conjugated bilirubin covalently bound to albumin, subsequently called delta-bilirubin. This form of bilirubin is mainly seen with cholestatic hepatic diseases. The life span of delta-bilirubin is dependent on the half-life of albumin (approximately 14 days). Because of the strong covalent bond to albumin, delta-bilirubin does not appear in the urine or have significant hepatocellular uptake. Thus, because of these features and the long half-life of albumin, delta-bilirubin remains elevated even after cholestasis is completely resolved. There is marked variability in the amount of delta-bilirubin among dogs. This explains the persistent elevation in total bilirubin concentration (and clinical icterus) following surgical correction of biliary obstruction in some patients. The finding of increased total bilirubin concentration without concurrent hyperbilirubinuria suggests the presence of delta-bilirubin (excluding artifact). In these patients resolution of bilirubinuria may be the best marker of resolution of cholestasis.",

Of these, bile acids are the most abundant and are the major solute in bile, constituting three fourths of the total solids. They are synthesized in the liver as a result of cholesterol metabolism and secreted into the bile. Feeding is a normal stimulus for bile acid secretion. They enter the intestine and undergo an efficient enterohepatic circulation following passive and active absorption from the ileum. Both unaltered bile acids and those deconjugated and dehydroxylated by intestinal bacteria are reabsorbed and enter the enterohepatic circulation. They are efficiently removed by the liver, reconjugated if necessary, and resecreted in bile. Hepatocellular uptake is a highly efficient process with large excess capacity, operating far from saturation under physiologic conditions. During a typical meal the total bile acid pool is recycled two to three times through this enterohepatic pathway. Only small amounts of bile acids are lost in the feces. Normally the liver synthesizes enough bile acids to compensate for fecal losses, which are minimal with respect to the total bile acid pool. Although bile acid formation depends on hepatic synthesis, the liver reserve capacity for this is never exceeded because of the small amounts needed for physiologic purposes.",

This occurs with many hepatobiliary diseases. When the liver parenchyma is diseased, the inability of normal uptake, conjugation, and secretion results in decreased extraction of bile acids from the portal circulation and leads to increased systemic concentrations. With intrahepatic or posthepatic cholestasis, bile acids diffuse from bile into the systemic circulation in a manner similar to that of bilirubin. With portosystemic shunting (either congenital or acquired), the enterohepatic circulation is directly interrupted and bile acids fail to be extracted by the bypassed liver. In this setting, hepatic synthesis of bile acids continues in order to maintain a normal bile acid pool. This can result in tremendous increases in systemic concentrations, especially following feeding.

The most common cause of portal hypertension is cirrhosis, resulting in increased resistance in sinusoidal vessels caused by swelling of hepatocytes or fibrosis around sinusoids causing postsinusoidal outflow block. The combination of increased portal pressure and blood flow causes an increase in hepatic lymph formation.When this is excessive, ascites results.

In this setting there is renal salt and water retention before the development of ascites, thus expanding the circulating plasma volume and contributing to the development of portal hypertension. Eventually portal hypertension leads to the development of ascites, with hypoalbuminemia continuing to perpetuate it. Factors that may initiate renal salt and water retention include increased sensitivity to aldosterone and failure to release or respond to natriuretic hormone in response to an expanded circulating plasma volume. The latter situation results in the inability to excrete a salt and water load in response to volume expansion. In addition, the normal negative feedback system that governs the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system does not shut off and reduce aldosterone secretion in the presence of portal hypertension and ascites. This is because the high concentrations of aldosterone do not return effective circulating plasma volume to normal in the presence of ascites, despite the retention of sodium. Because of these mechanisms, therapeutic interventions for managing ascites include salt restriction and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis with drugs such as spironolactone, enalapril, and benazepril.

In this setting, ascites is present when plasma albumin concentrations are higher than when ascites can be attributed to hypoalbuminemia alone.

In dogs, fasting serum bile acid concentrations are significantly increased with congenital portosystemic shunts, glucocorticoid-induced hepatopathy, hepatic neoplasia, hepatitis, cholestasis, hepatic necrosis, and cirrhosis. Of these diseases, dogs with glucocorticoid-induced hepatopathy have the lowest increase in concentration of serum bile acids. Therefore marked increase in elevations (i.e., greater than 75 to 100 \u03bcmol/L) are unlikely to be caused by glucocorticoid-induced hepatopathy. Although serum bile acid concentrations are a sensitive indicator of hepatic function, they do not distinguish the cause of the disease process. The magnitude of elevation in serum bile acid concentrations is weakly correlated with histologic severity. Furthermore, dogs with intestinal disease and normal hepatic function have normal serum bile acid concentrations. This is important in cases of \"reactive hepatopathy\" associated with intestinal or pancreatic disease. The determination of 2hour postprandial concentrations further increases the sensitivity of this test in most diseases and should be done routinely in conjunction with the preprandial sample.",

Ammonia is produced from bacterial action in the colon on substrates such as dietary proteins, sloughed intestinal epithelial cells, and urea, which freely diffuses into the colon from the plasma. Once absorbed into the portal circulation, ammonia is extracted by the liver and converted to urea through the urea cycle enzyme pathway. Normally this extraction process is very efficient, with only a small amount of ammonia escaping into the systemic circulation. The concentration of ammonia in the portal vein is approximately 350 \u03bcg/dl in the dog (and approximately 700 \u03bcg/dl in the cat), whereas the normal concentration in the systemic circulation is approximately 20 to 120 \u03bcg/dl.

This can be done by measuring ammonia concentration in the postprandial state or by administering an oral or rectal ammonia load. The latter provocative test is known as the oral ammonia tolerance test. The test is performed by taking a resting plasma ammonia sample, then administering oral ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) at a dosage of 45 mg/lb body weight, with a maximum dose of 3 g. Ammonium chloride is available from most chemical reagent suppliers or as the main ingredient of some urinary acidifiers. It is dissolved in 20 to 50 ml tap water and administered via orogastric tube, then flushed with 20 ml water. Alternatively, it can be administered in empty gelatin capsules. A plasma sample is then obtained 30 minutes later for ammonia measurement. A rectal ammonia tolerance test has been described. This is performed by administering 1 ml/lb body weight of a 5% solution of NH 4 Cl following cleansing enemas. A plasma sample is then obtained 20 to 40 minutes later. Theoretically, rectal administration has the advantage that vomiting of the orally administered solution is not a problem. However, in my experience, vomiting following oral NH 4 Cl administration is rarely a clinical problem, especially when the solution is diluted with water as described above, and does not invalidate the test if it occurs. Often the cause of vomiting is hyperammonemia, and therefore ammonia measurements are diagnostic of hepatic failure. In normal patients, there should be little or no increment in plasma ammonia concentration following administration of ammonium chloride (less than 32% increase).",

Increased activity of SAST occurs with both hepatocyte and muscle damage, as well as with hemolysis (in vitro or in vivo). AST is found both free in the cytoplasm and within mitochondria of the hepatocyte.With hepatic disease, SAST activity usually parallels that of SALT. Usually the magnitude of increase in SALT activity exceeds that of SAST activity.

Therefore a more severe insult is required to cause mitochondrial damage and thus release of SAST from this site compared with damaging the hepatocellular membrane only.

Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and readily excreted by the kidneys. The dog has a very low renal threshold for bilirubin excretion; thus the finding of +1 to +3 bilirubinuria in a concentrated sample is normal. Therefore the concentration of bilirubin in the urine increases before that of the serum. Thus the serum bilirubin concentration is an insensitive indicator of hepatocellular disease, and serum concentrations are not increased until there is marked decrease in hepatic function. Therefore slight elevations in serum bilirubin concentration are significant, suggesting hepatobiliary disease. The exception to this is with artifactual increases in serum bilirubin concentration, as would occur with lipemia or hemolysis. If there is not significant bilirubinuria associated with a serum bilirubin concentration greater than normal, artifact should be considered. The cat has a high renal threshold for bilirubin excretion, and any bilirubin in the urine is abnormal.When serum bilirubin is in the normal range (anicteric hepatic disease), other tests of hepatic function discussed earlier are needed for detection, such as serum bile acid or blood ammonia measurements.

In addition to lack of production occurring with hepatic disease, albumin concentration can drop from protein-calorie malnutrition (sometimes associated with an extremely low protein diet, often used in the therapeutic management of hepatic disease) and from an increased volume of distribution due to ascites, resulting in a dilutional effect on serum albumin concentration. Although serum albumin concentration is an insensitive and nonspecific test of hepatic function, hypoalbuminemia may be the only change on a serum biochemistry profile in certain cases of hepatic failure (such as cirrhosis and portosystemic shunts), and its presence may justify specific hepatic function tests (e.g., serum bile acid assay), which may subsequently identify hepatic failure. In one study the presence of hypoalbuminemia in dogs with chronic hepatitis was a predictor of shorter survival time.",

However, like serum albumin concentration, a low BUN concentration may be the only abnormality on a serum biochemistry profile and may be an important clue as to the presence of hepatic disease.

A mesenteric or jejunal vein is catheterized at laparotomy. A vessel that can eventually be sacrificed is selected, and as large a catheter as possible is used. Once the catheter is secured, an intravenous extension set is attached and the abdomen temporarily closed (with the extension set exiting through the abdominal wall).

Completely automatic needles thrust the inner obturator (containing the biopsy tray or specimen notch) followed by the outer cutting sheath into the organ in a fraction of a second.

These needles have some of the advantages of the completely automatic needles and have the additional advantages of having more control over final needle position and being lighter with a smaller handle. These characteristics also make these needles well suited to computed tomography (CT) guidance because the handle can be let free by the operator for intraprocedural scanning without the weight of the handle causing the needle to move.

Usually these are smaller-gauge needles (20 to 22 gauge) and therefore tend to be less traumatic. Aspiration needles employ suction to obtain fluid or cut the core of tissue. The Menghini needle is especially suited for transthoracic hepatic biopsy but can be used for transabdominal techniques as well. The tip of the needle is slightly oblique and convex and cuts a core of tissue when suction is applied as the needle is rapidly thrust into the liver and immediately withdrawn. The intrahepatic phase should last just a fraction of a second. A sliding screw acts as a depth gauge and prevents the needle from entering too deeply into the parenchyma.

The patient is given corn oil orally (1 ml/lb body weight) to cause the gallbladder to contract and thus minimize the risk of inadvertent puncture. A Menghini needle is used to obtain the biopsy specimen. The patient is placed in left lateral recumbency, and the right hemithorax clipped and surgically prepared. A local anesthetic is injected subcutaneously at the needle puncture site: just dorsal to the costochondral junction of the fifth through seventh intercostal space (depending on the size of the patient and distance to the diaphragm). Using a No. 11 blade, a skin incision is made to prevent dulling of the biopsy needle.With the stylet of the Menghini needle in place, the needle is \"popped\" into the pleural space and then directed caudally and parallel to the rib cage until it contacts the diaphragm (respiratory movements will be felt). Care is taken to avoid lacerating the intercostal vessels that lie along the caudal aspect of each rib. Upon making contact with the diaphragm, the needle depth gauge is slid to within approximately 1.5 cm of the skin so that the depth of penetration into the liver is limited to this distance.The stylet is then removed and quickly replaced with a 12-ml syringe filled with 5 to 6 ml of sterile saline. Negative pressure corresponding to approximately 3 ml of fluid volume is produced by drawing on the plunger. At the peak of expiration, the needle is rapidly thrust into the liver (with the distance limited by the depth gauge) and immediately withdrawn from the patient in one swift motion, maintaining negative pressure throughout. This entire step (i.e., the intrahepatic phase) should last only a split second. The core of hepatic tissue should rest within the fluid in the syringe or in the needle. The plunger is removed and the contents poured into culture broth, onto a slide for impression cytologyic study, and/or into a jar containing 10% formalin. The patient is then immediately turned onto its right side for approximately 5 minutes to allow the weight of the liver to control hemorrhage.",

It has a longer intrahepatic phase than the transthoracic technique if a cutting type of needle is used, and therefore a higher degree of sedation may be necessary in an uncooperative patient. The patient is given corn oil orally (2 ml/kg body weight) to cause the gallbladder to contract and thus reduce the risk of inadvertent puncture. I prefer to use automated cutting type of needles such as the Monopty or ASAP needles. The patient is placed in right dorsal oblique recumbency at a 45-degree angle. In this position the stomach falls down toward the right side. A large area around the xiphoid cartilage is clipped and surgically prepared. A local anesthetic is injected subcutaneously at the needle entry site: just caudal and to the left of the xiphoid cartilage, in the middle of the \"V\" formed by the xiphoid cartilage and the rib cage. If the needle enters too far cranially, it may inadvertently enter the thoracic cavity. If there is hepatomegaly, the entry site is moved caudally as appropriate for the hepatic size. The skin is incised with a No. 11 blade to prevent dulling of the biopsy needle. The biopsy needle is inserted and advanced just through the body wall and aimed in a craniolateral direction towards the left shoulder. The needle should be advanced during inspiration. The liver should be very close to the body wall, and the needle need not be advanced very far. Penetration of the liver is often not felt. The most common error using this technique is inserting the needle too far and going completely through the liver. Once the liver is entered the biopsy needle is operated to cut the sample. This is done during peak inspiration. The needle is removed after each attempt. The core of hepatic tissue should be resting within the specimen notch of the needle. If the initial attempt fails to obtain hepatic tissue, the needle is redirected based on perceived location of the liver, body conformation (i.e., deep chested), and direction of previous attempts. Tissue is carefully removed with a 25-gauge needle and placed into culture broth, onto a slide for impression cytologic study, and/or into 10% formalin.

For focal liver biopsy the location of the lesion will determine the position of the scan head and needle path. For diffuse lesions the transducer is usually placed just caudal and to the left of the xiphoid and aimed at the left medial or lateral lobes. In patients with extremely small livers, it may be difficult to adequately visualize the needle without stomach gas interfering. In this case placing the patient in a 45-degree right ventral oblique position often helps reduce interference from the stomach. Otherwise the patient is usually placed in dorsal recumbency for most procedures. A rubber trough or V tray assists in positioning. In addition, if the patient is under gas general anesthesia, an assistant compresses the rebreathing bag to hold the patient in deep inspiration.

Therefore the needle must be loaded before entry into the abdomen. While one hand maneuvers the transducer, the other hand advances the needle into the organ under direct ultrasound visualization. If the needle tip cannot be seen, gentle movement of the transducer should allow visualization. To allow distinction of the needle from other echogenic structures in the image, the needle can be gently moved in and out. Ideally this should be minimal and just enough to move the organ within the abdominal cavity rather than moving the needle within the organ. If a spinal needle is used, moving the stylet in and out of the stationary needle increases the echogenicity and visualization of the needle tip without creating tissue trauma. Occasionally the needle cannot be visualized. Indirect evidence of organ puncture can be used, including movement of the organ or visualization of motion at the organ border.

By the time the hematocrit drops, it might be too late to begin a life-saving blood transfusion. Therefore clinical monitoring, including assessing mucous membrane color and capillary refill time, is most helpful. Intravenous fluid support and/or blood transfusion may be necessary to treat hypovolemic shock. If the patient has a known coagulopathy before biopsy, crossmatching should be performed and compatible blood made available. If at all possible, blood transfusion with stored blood should be avoided because it contains a high concentration of ammonia resulting from elaboration from red blood cells.

There appears to be strong institutional bias in regard to this question, usually depending on expertise and experiences of the entire team of clinicians involved (e.g., internist, radiologist, pathologist). My impression is that fine needle aspirates are only helpful for certain conditions, such as to confirm the diagnosis of hepatic lipidosis and certain types of neoplasms (lymphoma and mast cell tumor). However, fine needle aspirates usually fail to define lobular architecture, the location of inflammation within the lobule, degree of fibrosis, degree of cholestasis, vascular pathologic condition, and so on. Fine needle aspirates are also often unreliable in mixed lesions. A recent study comparing fine needle aspirates for cytologic study with surgical biopsy specimens suggested that cytologic examination is unreliable in all categories of hepatic disease in dogs and cats. Needle biopsies may also be limited in their usefulness in some situations as well, depending on the quality and quantity of the biopsy samples obtained. I occasionally receive results of needle biopsy specimen analysis that do not adequately explain the clinical and laboratory features of the patient. It is likely that some of these cases simply have sampling error. Needle biopsy specimens procured via ultrasound guidance are typically obtained from the portion of liver that can be seen best (usually the left medial lobe), with minimal attempts to sample other sites. Geographic diversity and the limited sample size may explain failure in these cases. For example, needle biopsy specimens of regenerative nodules often can be suggestive of a metabolic disorder.

Some clinicians believe that the disorder is not a specific disease but rather a general reaction by the liver to any injury, with the histologic pattern one of nonspecific inflammation as a response to any insult.

Briefly, it is proposed that immunologic factors lead to the perpetuation of inflammation following hepatocyte damage caused by any agent. Following hepatocyte injury, there is a release of hepatic antigens previously not exposed to the systemic immune system (hidden from immune surveillance). This results in an influx of inflammatory cells (primarily lymphocytes and plasma cells), which cause antibody-mediated and complement-mediated cytotoxicity. This results in further hepatocyte injury, and this vicious cycle is perpetuated by these immunologic events and occurs long after the initial insult is gone. At first the reaction occurs near the portal triads, but eventually it extends beyond the limiting plate of hepatocytes (the single-cell-thick layer of hepatocytes surrounding the portal triad) into the hepatic lobule. This eventually results in necrosis and bridging fibrosis (inflammation and fibrosis extending between adjacent portal areas). When the normal hepatic architecture is lost and the fibrotic process becomes diffuse, it is termed cirrhosis. Whether these events occur in the dog as has been proposed in humans, and whether the syndrome seen in dogs is analogous to CAH in human beings, is unknown.",

However, copper is normally excreted in the bile, and it accumulates in hepatocytes with any cholestatic disorder. The finding of high hepatic copper concentrations in two Doberman pinschers with subacute hepatitis (i.e., without evidence of cholestasis) suggests the possibility of a primary copper-storage disease. For the purposes of this discussion, however, the disease seen in the Doberman pinscher breed will be considered with that seen as idiopathic CAH in other breeds because the clinical features are similar.

The majority of inflammatory cells are lymphocytes and plasma cells, although there are lesser numbers of neutrophils and macrophages.

A complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count should be obtained 3 and 6 weeks after starting azathioprine and every 2 months thereafter to look for potential myelosuppression. If this is detected, azathioprine should either be tapered or discontinued depending on the magnitude of the cytopenia. During the tapering process, patients are monitored with serum biochemistry profiles for relapses. Often it is difficult to differentiate the effect of prednisone on serum hepatic enzyme activities (especially ALP activity) from the effect of the disease process on serum enzyme activities. In this setting, clinical judgment is used to determine if prednisone should continue to be tapered. Serial bile acid assays and serum bilirubin and albumin concentrations also can be used to monitor the patient.

The latter mechanism is believed to be mediated through the cholehepatic shunting hypothesis. This proposes that ursodeoxycholate is converted to ursodeoxycholic acid through addition of a hydrogen ion originating from carbonic acid. This leaves a bicarbonate ion to act as an osmotic draw for water to decrease viscosity and promote bile flow.

Cholangiohepatitis is one of the most common hepatobiliary diseases of the cat. The diseases are named by the predominant inflammatory cell involved. The most common form is that of lymphocytic-plasmacytic cholangiohepatitis. Other forms include a predominantly neutrophilic infiltration (suppurative cholangiohepatitis), lymphocytic infiltration, and biliary cirrhosis (diffuse fibrosis of the biliary system, thought to be an end stage of a primary inflammatory disease).",

Because the predominant inflammatory cells are usually lymphocytes and plasma cells, an immune-mediated etiology is suspected. There are also histologic similarities to primary biliary cirrhosis in humans, believed to have an immunemediated basis. In humans there are abnormalities in cell-mediated and humoral immunity, circulating immune complexes, and antimitochondrial antibodies. These have not been documented in the cat because of the limitation of laboratory techniques for their detection. Additional evidence for an immune-mediated etiology is the marked improvement seen with glucocorticoid treatment in many cats. Although immunemediated mechanisms may occur in many cats, there are concurrent diseases identified in some cases. These include pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, bile duct obstruction, systemic infection, toxins, and cholelithiasis. In cases of suppurative cholangiohepatitis, it is suspected that bacterial infection may be an underlying cause. Escherichia coli or other bacteria are occasionally grown from cultures of hepatic biopsy samples in cases of either neutrophilic or lymphocyticplasmacytic cholangiohepatitis, which supports this theory. It is unclear whether bacterial growth is a cause or effect of the hepatic disease. As with any cause of hepatic failure, decreased clearance of portal bacteria (such as E. coli ascending from the bowel) secondary to abnormal hepatic reticuloendothelial cell function can occur.When evaluating a suspected case of cholangiohepatitis, the clinician should make efforts to rule out other predisposing causes mentioned above. If no other causes are identified, immune-mediated mechanisms should be suspected.",

The disease is characterized by diffuse involvement of the liver, so random-location hepatic biopsy is adequate for obtaining representative tissue. There is usually a prominent infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells, lymphocytes alone, or predominantly neutrophils in the portal triads (depending on the form of the disease). Portal triad fibrosis, bile duct proliferation, and centrilobular accumulation of bile with bile casts in canalicular areas is also frequently present. Septa of fibrous tissue with a variable lymphocytic infiltrate often link portal tracts and form circumscribed nodules of hepatocytes. It has been suggested that the disease can progress to biliary cirrhosis characterized by bridging portal fibrosis, bile duct proliferation and hyperplasia, and nodular regeneration with minimal inflammation. Aerobic and anaerobic culture of hepatic tissue with or without bile (obtained via cholecystocentesis) should be obtained. Culture is often positive, although it is not always clear if this is a primary or secondary event.

Some ingested copper is bound to the copper transport protein, metallothionein. This portion is lost in the feces. Unbound copper is absorbed from the intestine and enters the portal circulation, where it is bound to albumin and another copper transport protein, transcuprein. Copper is then transported to the liver. Within hepatocytes, copper is bound to cytosolic metallothionein and stored in lysosomes. Copper can then undergo two fates: it can be excreted in bile or bound to the copper transport protein ceruloplasmin for transport to peripheral tissues. Of these steps, the most important step that regulates copper homeostasis is biliary excretion. In dogs with abnormal copper storage, copper accumulates within the lysosomes of hepatocytes. While in the lysosomes, copper is innocuous. Once the lysosomal storage capacity is exhausted, copper breaks into the cytoplasm, where it is toxic to the hepatocytes. Excessive hepatic copper can alter hepatic membrane permeability and interfere with normal hepatocyte transport of proteins and triglycerides, and eventually these hepatocytes undergo cellular lysis and necrosis. This can result in massive release of copper from damaged hepatocytes, which when taken up in the circulation can lead to a hemolytic crisis.",

It is unclear whether a subset of Doberman pinschers with CAH have a primary copper-storage disease or whether the abnormal hepatic copper concentration is secondary to the cholestasis associated with the active hepatitis. One report, however, documented increased hepatic copper concentrations in two Doberman pinschers with subacute hepatitis in which cholestasis was not present histologically, leading to the speculation that a genetic defect in copper metabolism might be the primary cause of hepatic inflammatory disease in some Doberman pinschers. The disease in West Highland white terriers differs from the copper-storage disease in Bedlington terriers by comparatively lower concentrations of hepatic copper.West Highland white terriers can generally tolerate up to 2000 \u03bcg/g (ppm) of copper. West Highland white terriers rarely accumulate excess copper throughout their lifetime. By 6 months of age a West Highland white terrier has reached its upper limit of excess copper, and some dogs with excess hepatic copper will return to normal by 1 year of age.

            "text": "Recently VetGen, LLC, began offering a genetic test for copper toxicosis of the Bedlington terrier breed. This test uses a linked marker that has two alleles, or marker types, called 1 and 2. It was found that over 90% of dogs that were 1/1 marker type were homozygous normal (clear of the disease) and over 90% of dogs that were affected with the disease were 2/2 marker type. Most 1/2 dogs are carriers with the 2 allele usually associated with the copper toxicosis disease allele. The finding of such a strong genetic disequilibrium allows this to be potentially a valuable test. In interpreting the results, if the dog is a 1/1, it is more than 90% likely that it is homozygous normal (clear of disease). If the dog is a 2/2, it is 72% likely that it is affected (over 90% of affected dogs are 2/2, but 72% of 2/2 are affected; 24% are carriers). If the dog is a 1/2,VetGen data indicate the dog has a 95% chance of being a carrier. This test may be helpful in making recommendations to breeders. If only 1/1 and 1/2 dogs are chosen for breeding, the 2 gene could be eliminated in subsequent generations. However, breeders should still allow liver biopsy specimens to be obtained in 1/1 dogs to be used for breeding for the near to intermediate future because it is currently the only way to detect the small number of affected dogs associated with the 1 allele. VetGen provides a collection kit for DNA using a soft cheek brush. This test can be completed before puppies are purchased at an early age. * Treatment Early detection is essential. Therefore, because of the high incidence in the breed, it is strongly recommended that Bedlington terriers undergo biochemical screening two to three times per year. Ideally a liver biopsy should be performed at 1 year of age. Once a positive diagnosis is established, treatment depends on the stage of the disease. In affected dogs, specific therapy involves the administration of drugs that chelate copper and increase urinary excretion, as well as efforts to decrease copper absorption. Traditionally, the drug of choice has been D-Penicillamine (Cuprimine). The recommended dosage for dogs is 4.5 to 7 mg/lb two times a day. The drug should ideally be given before meals to maximize its effect. In this manner, penicillamine will remove approximately 1000 \u03bcg/g (ppm) of copper per year. When given with meals the efficacy decreases by approximately half. Common side effects include anorexia and vomiting. Further dividing the dosage into three to four daily doses and/or administering it with food often minimizes these signs. Unfortunately, these side effects may be intolerable in some dogs and necessitate discontinuation of the drug. It usually takes several years for hepatic copper concentrations to decrease to normal, and therapy must be continued for life. In addition to chelating copper, D-Penicillamine has antifibrotic properties, stabilizes lysosomes, and has immune-modulating effects that might also be of benefit in managing this disease.",

It has cupruretic effects similar to those of D-Penicillamine (i.e., removing approximately 1000 \u03bcg/g [ppm] of copper per year), although it may attack a different copper pool.

Zinc induces increased concentration of intestinal metallothionein, which then binds ingested copper to intestinal epithelial cells, thus preventing copper absorption. As these cells are sloughed, copper is subsequently lost in the feces. In addition, zinc will enhance removal of copper from hepatocytes. Zinc lowers hepatic copper indirectly by affecting multiple areas of copper equilibria and by displacing copper in target tissues. Zinc also induces hepatic metallothionein, which will then bind to and sequester excessive copper into an innocuous form compared with free copper. The rate of removal of hepatic copper is relatively slow. For this reason dogs with severe or fulminant hepatitis secondary to copper accumulation are not candidates for zinc therapy alone. For these patients zinc is commonly combined with a chelating agent such as trientine. One study demonstrated marked improvement in hepatitis and hepatic copper concentrations in three Bedlington terriers and three West Highland white terriers treated with zinc acetate as the sole decoppering agent. The advantages of zinc for treatment include efficacy, low cost, and minimal side effects. With any of the above types of zinc supplements, it is important to measure serum zinc levels. The goal is to achieve plasma zinc concentrations of 200 to 600 \u03bcg/dl. After a 3-to 6-month loading period, the dose is decreased to approximately half of the original dose. Serum zinc levels are then measured every 4 to 6 months. If the serum concentration drops below 150 \u03bcg/dl, the dose is increased to the original dose. To be effective, zinc must be given separately from food by at least 1 hour because some food constituents such as phytates can bind zinc and diminish its efficacy.

In the fetus the function of the liver for processing these products is minimal, and thus there are vessels to shunt blood away from the liver into the systemic venous circulation. Normally these vessels close shortly after birth, allowing the establishment of hepatic circulation. When any of these vessels remain patent after birth, portosystemic shunting occurs. The cause of these anomalies is unknown.When blood is diverted away from the liver, hepatic atrophy results because of the lack of tropic factors present in portal blood (especially insulin and glucagon).",

Following an injection into a mesenteric or jejunal vein, radiographic contrast medium normally flows into the portal vein and arborizes into the liver. In patients with a portosystemic shunt, contrast medium will bypass the liver and be seen in the caudal vena cava or azygous vein. If the caudal extent of the shunt is cranial to T13, it is probably an intrahepatic shunt, whereas if the caudal extent of the shunt is caudal to T13, it is probably an extrahepatic shunt. Once a shunt is identified on the angiographic study, one can proceed with surgical correction during the same surgical procedure. Alternatively, the patient can be allowed to recover from the anesthetic procedure used to obtain the angiogram and a second procedure is then performed later (2 to 4 weeks or longer) to correct the shunt.

This is readily done by placing a 3a or 5 Fr feeding tube into a mesenteric vein and threading it into the portal vein. This is then connected to a saline manometer to measure pressure, with the zero level standardized at the level of the femoral triangle or heart. Normal portal pressure is 10 to 15 cm H 2 O (8 to 12 mm Hg), and most patients have normal or decreased portal pressure before shunt manipulation. If a shunt is completely ligated, fatal acute portal hypertension can develop. This results from splanchnic congestion and stasis of blood, with the rapid development of endotoxic shock. During shunt attenuation with a silk suture, portal pressure should not exceed 20 to 23 cm H 2 O (18 to 21 mm Hg) or 11 cm H 2 O (8 mm Hg) above baseline. The silk ligature is placed as close to the vena cava as possible and gradually tightened while measuring portal pressure. Observing splanchnic viscera for signs of stasis, including blanching of the bowel, hypermotility of the small bowel, and distended and pulsating jejunal arteries is also important. Monitoring central venous pressure may also be helpful to predict the presence of portal hypertension. With increased portal resistance and decreased portal venous flow, central venous pressure drops because of decreased venous return and splanchnic venous pooling.",

Because the outer metal ring prevents outward expansion, there is inward expansion, gradually occluding the central hole, which has the shunt vessel in it. In this manner the shunt is gradually occluded, usually over a period of 4 to 8 weeks. Because there is gradual occlusion, there is no need to measure portal pressures.

There is excessive mobilization of fatty acids, which are subsequently incompletely metabolized in the liver, leading to accumulation within hepatocytes. Some cats have an underlying systemic disease that initiates the anorexia and is concurrent with hepatic lipidosis, although in most cases an underlying disorder is not identified.

This contributes to cholestasis and bile acid retention. There is also a unique abnormality in that there is a relative paucity of peroxisomes (rather than the up-regulation expected in circumstances of increased fatty acid oxidation), organelles important in the preprocessing of long-chain fatty acids before their presentation for mitochondrial oxidation. Peroxisomes take on an increased role in circumstances of mitochondrial dysfunction. Unlike mitochondria (which are dependent on carnitine), peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and transport is facilitated but not dependent on carnitine. Peroxisomes are also involved in bile acid synthesis, and subsequent peroxisome dysfunction has lead to abnormal bile acid profiles in cats with hepatic lipidosis.

This is usually accomplished with aggressive forcefeeding. In mild cases, methods to stimulate voluntary oral intake may be effective. Heating food and adding seasoning and salt substitutes to food may be helpful. However, tube feeding seems to be necessary in most cases. This is best accomplished with a PEG tube (No. 18 to 20 Fr), esophagostomy tube (No. 18 to 20 Fr), or nasoesophageal tube (No. 5 Fr) . My preference is to place a PEG tube in most cases, often when the cat is under general anesthesia for the hepatic biopsy procedure if analysis of an impression smear of the biopsy sample is suggestive of hepatic lipidosis. This avoids the stress of a second anesthetic procedure. However, there are some cats that are clearly not stable enough to undergo an anesthetic procedure for placement of a feeding tube. In these cases, cats often never recover completely from the procedure. In these patients it is usually much safer to obtain a biopsy specimen under local anesthesia or to rely on cytologic analysis of a fine needle aspirate. This is then followed by placement of a nasoesophageal tube with the cat awake. This allows administration of a liquid nutritional formula (such as CliniCare [Pet-Ag]) on a temporary basis. Constant administration with an infusion pump or gravity flow (versus bolus feeding) is also helpful if vomiting is a problem during the initial few days of treatment. These cats often have electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and should also be stabilized with appropriate intravenous fluids (non-lactate-containing fluids supplemented with potassium chloride or potassium phosphate).When the cat is more stable, a PEG or esophagostomy tube is then placed for long-term use at home.

Occasionally subcutaneous administration or constant intravenous infusion may be necessary. Other strategies to control vomiting include the addition of other antiemetics such as prochlorperazine (Compazine), chlorpromazine, or ondansetron.

When diluted with one part water to two parts food, the gruel contains 1.0 kcal/ml. Various dietary supplements have been proposed to be helpful in treating cats with idiopathic hepatic lipidosis. Carnitine supplementation seems to improve survival rates and shorten recovery times. In one report (n = 57) supplementation with L-carnitine (250 to 500 mg/day) was advocated based on the possibility that there is a relative carnitine deficiency. Compared with historical controls, cats that received L-carnitine had a recovery rate of 81% compared with a recovery rate of 37% in cats that did not receive L-carnitine. Cats that received L-carnitine and gastrostomy tube feedings had a recovery rate of 89% (cats that did not receive Lcarnitine but had gastrostomy tube feedings had a recovery rate of 29%). In this report, taurine supplementation (250 to 500 mg/day) was also advocated because many cats with hepatic lipidosis have decreased serum taurine concentrations. Taurine is important because this amino acid is used for obligatory bile acid conjugation in the cat and may modify the injurious potential of retained bile acids and increase their renal excretion. Thiamine should also be provided (100 mg by injection or orally two times a day for 3 days) if there is evidence of thiamine deficiency (ventral neck flexion).Vitamin E may be helpful to minimize oxidative hepatic injury. SAMe administration (9 mg/lb/day) may also help speed recovery. Vitamin K supplementation is used if overt bleeding is detected or suspected. If there is prolonged recovery (rare), ursodeoxycholic acid may be beneficial to help stabilize peroxisomes and because cholestasis is usually present (see earlier section on use of ursodeoxycholic acid in cats with cholangiohepatitis). In most cases ursodeoxycholic acid is not necessary because most cats recover or die before this drug can alter the outcome or provide hepatoprotection.

Virtually all cats recover if they survive beyond the first few days. The earlier they are treated, the higher the recovery rate. Spontaneous recovery is rare. Force-feeding may need to be prolonged (3 to 12 weeks). Most owners are able to manage gastrostomy or esophagostomy tube feeding at home during this period.

Once the cat is eating completely on its own without any tube feedings for 1 to 2 weeks, the tube is pulled.

There is failure to visualize the intestine with nuclear imaging by 3 hours in patients with biliary obstruction. In one study, this method was 83% sensitive and 94% specific (91% accurate) in diagnosing extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Finally, hepatic biopsy often suggests the presence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Treatment Treatment of bile duct obstruction depends on the underlying etiology (see Box 9-1). In most cases, specific medical therapy is not possible and symptomatic care or surgery is necessary. Approximately 80% of patients with pancreatitis that results in bile duct obstruction will eventually resume normal bile flow without surgical intervention if given appropriate supportive care and enough time. In these cases obstruction is probably associated with acute edema and inflammation around the bile duct.When this resolves, bile duct patency returns. Therefore if pancreatitis is suspected as the cause of biliary obstruction, supportive care is warranted in the initial period. If there is no biochemical or clinical improvement within 2 weeks, patency is unlikely to spontaneously occur and surgical intervention is warranted. During this period, nutritional support with jejunostomy tube feeding or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be required. There is no specific medical therapy for bile duct obstruction caused by pancreatitis.",

Because ammonia is produced primarily in the colon from bacterial action on dietary amines (proteins) and urea (which diffuses from the systemic circulation into the colon), efforts at lowering blood ammonia concentration are aimed at interrupting this process. This can be done in several ways. First, food is withheld initially to prevent dietary proteins from reaching the colon. In addition, large-volume (25 ml/lb body weight) cleansing enemas are used to decrease bacterial numbers. The enema solution should be composed of normal saline solution with betadine solution added to make a 10% solution to further decrease colonic bacterial numbers. Alternatively, gentamicin can be added (0.45 mg/lb body weight) to the saline solution to kill urease-producing bacteria. Saline also has the advantage of lowering colonic pH.

This has the effect of converting ammonia (NH 3 ) to the ammonium ion (NH 4 + ), thus trapping it in the colon and preventing its absorption. In addition, the metabolic by-products of lactulose induce an osmotic catharsis and there-fore lower colonic bacterial numbers. The initial dose of lactulose is 0.5 ml/lb body weight. It can be given by several routes. The oral route is preferred. In stuporous patients it can be administered via orogastric tube. Alternatively, it can be given mixed with a saline enema.

These features will minimize the amount of protein reaching the colon and allow the protein that is absorbed to be used for the body's synthetic functions.

If too little protein is fed, there will not be enough nitrogen for the liver's synthetic functions, including synthesis of albumin and clotting factors. In addition, a protein deficiency causes catabolism of body proteins, leading to negative nitrogen balance and a cachectic state. This can also result in excess ammonia production.

Because the extrahepatic bile duct goes through the pancreas before it enters the duodenum, disease in the area of the pancreas can result in obstruction. Though pancreatitis is the most common cause of bile duct obstruction, most cases of pancreatitis do not result in bile duct obstruction.Clinical Findings Many patients with bile duct obstruction are symptomatic for their underlying disease (for example, patients with pancreatitis often have vomiting and abdominal pain). Signs associated with bile duct obstruction include weight loss, jaundice, anorexia, acholic feces, and vomiting. If the cause of the obstruction is not inflammatory in nature, clinical signs are often surprisingly mild. Often jaundice is the first sign observed.Laboratory findings include elevations in serum hepatic enzyme activities. Often the serum activities of the cholestatic enzymes (ALP and GGT) are disproportionately elevated compared with serum activities of the transaminases (ALT and AST). However, this is not a consistent finding and many cases of intrahepatic cholestasis have similar biochemical profiles. Serum total bilirubin concentration is also elevated to a variable degree depending on the degree of obstruction. The relative amounts of direct (conjugated) and indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin are variable and often indistinguishable from changes seen with intrahepatic cholestasis. Therefore laboratory findings identify hepatobiliary disease but do not aid in distinguishing intrahepatic from posthepatic causes of cholestasis. This is currently best accomplished with ultrasonography. Ultrasonographic findings include common and intrahepatic bile duct distention, as well as gallbladder enlargement. These changes take several days to occur following obstruction. Dilation progresses from common bile duct to peripheral intrahepatic bile ducts over a period of 5 to 7 days following bile duct obstruction. Enlarged intrahepatic bile ducts can be distinguished from portal vessels by their tortuosity, irregular branching pattern, and abrupt and variable changes in lumenal diameter. In addition, the cause of obstruction (such as neoplasia) is often identified on an ultrasonographic examination.Hepatobiliary scintigraphy has also been used to distinguish extrahepatic biliary obstruction",
