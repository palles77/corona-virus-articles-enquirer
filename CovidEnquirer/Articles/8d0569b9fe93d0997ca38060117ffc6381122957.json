The present study was carried out to apply the RNAi technology to inhibit the replication of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Four small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) homologous to the FIV gag gene were synthesized and transfected into a feline fibroblastic cell line chronically infected with FIV (CRFK/FIV). These synthetic siRNAs efficiently inhibited the replication of FIV. Next, we examined the effect of retroviral vector-mediated transfer of FIVspecific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) on the replication of FIV in a feline T-cell line chronically infected with FIV (FL4). The retroviral vector-mediated transfer of FIV-specific shRNA was shown to markedly inhibit the replication of FIV in the FL4 cells. These results provide useful information for the development of RNAi-based gene therapy strategy to control FIV infection. #",

            "text": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) belongs to the genus lentivirus of the family retroviridae. FIV was first isolated in 1987 in the United States and has been reported to induce crucial immunodeficiency in infected cats, which is similar to that in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people (Pedersen et al., 1987) . FIV is now widely spread among domestic cats throughout the world including Europe, the United States, Australia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan (Ishida et al., 1989; Lin et al., 1995; Malik et al., 1997; Nakamura et al., 2000; Steinrigl and Klein, 2003; Yamamoto et al., 1989) . FIV-infected cats show various degree of immunological impairment resulting in the clinical symptoms including gingivitis, www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 120 (2007) 207-216 stomatitis, upper respiratory tract infections, myelosuppression and opportunistic infections (Bendinelli et al., 1995; Pedersen and Barlough, 1991; Shelton et al., 1990) . Because of the prevalence and various clinical outcomes, FIV infection has been considered as one of the most problematic diseases in small animal practice. A number of antiviral drugs such as reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, have been shown to inhibit FIV replication in experimentally and naturally FIV-infected cats (Arai et al., 2002; Egberink et al., 1990; Hartmann et al., 1992) . However, severe hematological side effects of their antiviral drugs and insufficient clinical improvements in FIV-infected cats were also reported (Arai et al., 2002; Hartmann et al., 1992) . Therefore, no effective antiviral therapy for FIV-infected cats has been established.",

The dsRNAs are processed by RNase III-like enzyme Dicer into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 21-23 nucleotides (Bernstein et al., 2001) . These siRNAs form an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which leads to the degradation of homologous target RNA (Zamore et al., 2000) . Introduction of siRNAs can induce the sequence-specific gene silencing in mammalian cells (Elbashir et al., 2001) . Recent studies have demonstrated that RNAi can be exploited to target a variety of human viruses including HIV-1, poliovirus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (Ge et al., 2003; Gitlin et al., 2002; Jacque et al., 2002; Jiang and Milner, 2002; Randall et al., 2003; Shlomai and Shaul, 2003; Wang et al., 2004) . These findings indicate that RNAi represents a promising gene therapeutic approach to control viral infection.",

In contrast, endogenous expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) mediated by viral vectors has been shown to induce persistently the sequence-specific gene silence in a variety of primary cells as well as in experimental animals (Rubinson et al., 2003; Xia et al., 2002) . To use the RNAi technology as a strategy of gene therapy for the control of FIV infection, both development of effective delivery method of siRNAs into feline lymphoid cells and achievement of sustained inhibitory effect are required. Lentivirus vector is now recognized to be the most efficient delivery method into non-dividing primary cells. However, it has not been used for clinical practices because the safety of lentivirus vector-mediated gene transfer has not been fully established. On the other hand, retrovirus vector has been applied for several human gene therapy clinical trials (Edelstein et al., 2004) . There have been a number of reports indicating the therapeutic effect of retrovirus vector-mediated transfer of antiviral genes in HIV-infected people (Deeks et al., 2002; Wong-Staal et al., 1998) .",

The probes were labeled with a reporter dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and a quencher dye, 6-carboxytetramethylrodamine (TAMRA) at their 5 0 and 3 0 ends, respectively. Total RNA from each sample was subjected to reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with a TaqMan Gold RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, a master mixture containing all reagents required for RT-PCR was prepared: 1\u00c2 TaqMan buffer A, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 5 mM magnesium chloride, 0.25 U of MultiScribe reverse transcriptase per ml, 0.4 U of RNase inhibitor per ml, and 0.05 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase per ml. Total RNA extract (200 ng of total RNA per tube) was added to the master mixture. This mixture was used for assays of FIV RNA and b-actin mRNA used as an internal control to give a final probe concentration of 200 nM and a final concentration of each primer of 900 nM, and the total reaction volume was adjusted to 50 ml. The target and internal control were reverse transcribed at 48 8C for 30 min, held at 95 8C for 10 min to activate AmpliTaq Gold, and subjected to PCR consisting of 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 8C for 15 s and annealing/polymerization at 60 8C for 1 min, with a ABI PRISM7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). The PCR cycle number at the threshold line was represented as C T . The difference between C T for the target and C T for the internal control, DC T , was calculated. The DC T values were used to estimate the amounts of FIV RNA.

For application of RNAi technology to therapeutic purposes of naturally FIV-infected cats, sequence diversity of FIV genome should be considered. The sequence used for preparation of G4-siRNA, which efficiently inhibited the replication of FIV in this study, is highly conserved among various strains of FIV (Kakinuma et al., 1995) . Therefore, it is highly plausible that the siRNA such as G4 inhibits the replication of various field strains of FIVas well as Petaluma strain. However, since gene silencing by RNAi requires almost perfect complementarity between the siRNA and its target sequence, further investigation is required to examine the inhibitory effect of the siRNAs on the replications of diverse FIV strains.",

Therefore, we examined the effect of the retrovirus vectormediated transfer of the shRNA in feline T-cell line. The amount of FIV RNA and RT activity in the culture supernatant of the FL4 cells were markedly decreased even 2 weeks after transduction with a retrovirus vector which express shRNA specific to FIV. This result suggests the therapeutic effect of the retrovirus vector-mediated delivery of FIV-specific shRNA in cells infected with FIV. However, the retrovirus vector-mediated FIV-specific shRNA transfer could not achieve complete inhibition of FIV replication even after the selection by antibiotic. As for the reason, there might exist a small number of cells in which the amount of shRNA was not enough to inhibit FIV replication even in cells after antibiotic selection. As another possibility, FIV clones to escape from the shRNA might exist in FL4 cells because it is not a cloned cell line.",

Further investigation is necessary to improve the transduction efficiency of the retrovirus vector in primary T cells. Another candidate of target cells for RNAi gene therapy to control FIV infection is hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Development of antiviral gene therapy strategies that target HSC has been proposed as a long-term treatment for AIDS induced by HIV infection. In theory, permanent resistance to HIV infection can be achieved through the introduction of antiviral genes into pluripotent HSC because of their capacity of self-renewal as well as proliferation and differentiation into lymphoid lineage. Recently, HSCs transduced with siRNA construct directed to HIV were shown to allow to mature into T-lymphocytes in vivo in SCID-hu mouse thy/liv grafts and these HSC-derived siRNA-expressing T cells and macrophages showed marked resistance to HIV infection (Banerjea et al., 2003) . Although isolation and purification system of feline HSC has not been established, viral vector-mediated transfer of anti-FIV shRNA into HSC will be a useful gene therapy strategy for the control of FIV infection in cats in future.",
