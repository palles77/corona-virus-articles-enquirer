The approach 72 described herein is crucial to bring standardization and to ensure the quality of the generated 73 sequences in clinical setting. We provide an easy-to-use single protocol successfully 74 Since the development of Next Generation-Sequencing (NGS) technologies in 2005, 78 the use of metagenomic approaches has grown considerably. It is now considered as an 79 efficient unbiased tool in clinical virology [1, 2] , in particular for the characterization of viral 80 acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Several advantages of metagenomic NGS (mNGS) 81 compared to conventional real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays have been 82 highlighted. Firstly, the full viral genetic information is immediately available allowing the 83 investigation of respiratory outbreaks, viral epidemiological surveillance, or identification of 84 specific mutations leading to antiviral resistance or higher virulence [3] [4] [5] . Secondly, a 85 significant improvement in viral ARIs diagnosis has been reported [4,6-9]; as the process is 86 sequence independent, mNGS is able to identify highly divergent viral genomes, rare 87 respiratory pathogens, and to discover respiratory viruses missed by targeted PCR [1, 4, 7] . all of these have to be controlled to ensure the quality of the generated sequences [6, [14] [15] [16] . 96 Furthermore, specimen to specimen, environmental, and reagent contaminations are also a 97 major concern in metagenomic setting and must be accurately evaluated [6, [17] [18] [19] . 98",

In order to optimize IQC spiking 179 level, the sensitivity of the metagenomic analysis workflow for MS2 detection was first 180 evaluated with a ten-fold serial dilutions of MS2 (from 10 -2 to 10 -5 ) in a nasopharyngeal swab 181 tested negative using FA RP (bioM\u00e9rieux). MS2 was detected in internal QCT1 (IQCT1) for 182 all levels of MS2 spiking (Ct ranged from 17.5 at the 10 -2 dilution to 26.4 Ct at the 10 -5 183 dilution). Full to partial MS2 genome coverage was obtained for all MS2 spiking levels in 184 internal QCT2 (IQCT2; coverage ranged from 98% at the 10 -2 dilution to 69% at the 10 -5 185 dilution). For the highest spiking level, 66.0% of the total number of viral reads was mapped 186 to MS2; for the lowest spiking level, 0.9% were so (Fig. 2) . To limit the number of NGS reads 187 consumed for IQC detection, the optimal spiking condition was determined to be the 10 -188 5 dilution and was used for the rest of the study. Normalized read counts were significantly lower for linear dsDNA viruses than for other viral 237 genome types (Fig. 4b) . 238 compared to the other viral genome types were noticed. As previously described for EBV and 302 CMV, the necessary use of DNase to reduce host contamination may affect these fragile large 303 dsDNA viruses [9,10]. As the detection limit of mNGS analysis is mainly dependent on viral 304 load and total number of reads per sample, this effect could be overcome by increasing 305 sequencing depth; however, we chose to limit the costs of the workflow. 306",

For sample # 37 and sample # 19, none of the real-time PCR targeted viruses 213 were detected after bioinformatic analysis. For sample # 19, we sequenced a replicate which 214 similarly failed both IQC and HBoV detection. We could not test any replicate for sample # 215 37 owing to insufficient quantity.

            "text": "last few years, a growing number of viral metagenomic protocols have been 240 published but systematic evaluation on clinical respiratory samples and validation by QC is 241 still lacking. In the present study, we describe a process allowing the sensitive detection of 242 both DNA and RNA viruses in a single assay and implemented several QCs to validate the 243 whole metagenomic workflow. 244First, IQC was implemented to control the integrity of the reagents, equipment, the presence 245 of inhibitors, and to allow the validation of mNGS results for each sample. The MS2 246 bacteriophage was selected as IQC for three main reasons; firstly MS2 is widely used as IQC 247 during viral real-time PCR assays to control both extraction and inhibition [24], secondly, an 248 RNA virus was required to control the random reverse transcription and second strand 249 synthesis steps, and thirdly MS2 is a ssRNA virus with a small genome (3,569-bp) that is 250 perfectly characterized and therefore can be easily detected after bioinformatic analysis 251 without the need for extensive NGS reads. The use of MS2 as an IQC has been previously 252 reported for metagenomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid specimens[25]. In another 253 metagenomic study, RNA of MS2 was included after extraction as an IQC but the use of 254 purified RNA does not validate the viral enrichment step [26]. In the protocol described 255 herein, whole MS2 virions were added to each clinical sample from the beginning of the 256 workflow. QCT1 was implemented to control the first steps of the process and to avoid 257 unnecessary library preparation when these steps fail. At the end of the workflow, QCT2 was 258 able to invalidate 2 samples as neither MS2 nor viruses causing ARIs were significantly 259 detected after metagenomic analysis while routine PCR screenings detected a HBoV and a 260HCoV. The re-testing of these 2 samples found the same findings suggesting an inhibition or261 a competition issue during the process. Without the use of IQC, these samples would have 262 been mistakenly classified as false negatives by mNGS. However, the expected competition 263 and MS2 during the process could lead to a non-detection of IQC reads in 264 case of high viral load. Thus, the interpretation of IQC results should consider the proportion 265 of viral reads of each sample. Although not observed, IQC reads may also be reduced in 266 samples with a greater numbers of patient cells which may affect the sensitivity of the assay 267 [25]. 268 In addition to IQC, we implemented negative external control because contamination issues 269 are frequently reported in metagenomic studies and may lead to misinterpretation in clinical 270 practice [17]. mNGS reads in this negative control were mainly composed of bacterial reads. 271 However, viral reads (mainly derived from prokaryote viruses) were also detected which 272 could be present in reagents (\"kitome\") or may represent laboratory contaminants or bleed-273 over contaminations from highly positive samples within the batch. Such contamination was 274 observed in the present study from the highly positive HBoV sample (sample # 23, Ct=15) 275 which contaminated the NTC (HBoV: 185 reads, RPKM = 1.1E+04 RPKM). In the clinical 276 setting, subtracting NTC viral reads prior to interpretation of each sample result is therefore 277 required. 278 To evaluate the workflow, clinical respiratory samples tested for a representative panel of 279 DNA and RNA viruses using real-time PCR were selected. This workflow is based on a 280 previous publication where a single protocol had been specifically developed for stool 281 specimens and evaluated on mock communities containing high concentrations of spiked 282 viruses [21]. Interestingly, 6 multiple viral infections involving both DNA and RNA viruses 283 were fully characterized highlighting the power of our mNGS approach as a universal method 284 for virus characterization despite the lack of common viral sequence. In addition to viruses 285 targeted by PCR, viral reads deriving from the commensal virome, including viruses from the 286 Anelloviridae family, were generated both in PCR negative and positive samples but not in sensitivity of the mNGS approach, a wide range of semi-quantitative real-time 289 PCR Ct values was covered. Thorburn et al., compared mNGS to conventional real-time 290 PCR for the detection of RNA viruses on nasopharyngeal swabs and reported a detection cut-291 off of 32 Ct for the mNGS approach [27]. Our workflow allowed the characterization of both 292 DNA and RNA viruses up to a semi-quantitative real-time PCR Ct value of 36 which is 293 considered to be a low viral load. A major critical point in viral metagenomics is to reduce 294 host and bacterial components. In comparison with similar studies, viral reads herein were 295 highly represented (mean = 7.4%); for example, a study on 16 nasopharyngeal aspirates tested 296 positive with viral PCR assays found a mean of 0.05% of viral reads [12]. In addition, a 297 strong correlation between results of mNGS and conventional real-time PCR was obtained by 298 regrouping viruses according to their genome types. Similar findings were reported 299 elsewhere, suggesting that mNGS results could be used for semi-quantitative measurement of 300 the viral load in clinical samples [3-5,28].

In addition, improvement of the bioinformatics pipeline are being explored, including 325 implementation of threshold regarding genome coverage pattern [25], but their impact on 326 performance of the workflow has to be established. 327 Conclusion 328 The potential of mNGS is very promising but several factors such as inhibition, competition, 329 and contamination can lead to a dramatic misinterpretation in the clinical setting.

Selected specimens included various types of clinical samples; 106 nasopharyngeal swabs (n=20), aspirates (n=10), or sputums (n=7). These samples were 107 initially sent to our laboratory for routine viral diagnosis of ARI using semi-quantitative real-108 time PCR assays targeting a comprehensive panel of DNA and RNA viruses (r-gene, 109 bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'\u00e9toile, France). This panel included: influenza virus type A and B, 110 adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus 6, human bocavirus 111 (HBoV), human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus, human 112 coronavirus (HCoV), human metapneumovirus, and measles virus. Twenty-two samples were 113 positive for only one targeted virus, 6 were characterized by a multiple viral infection and 9 114 were negative for all the targeted viruses. These 9 samples were also found to be negative 115 using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FA RP, bioM\u00e9rieux). After PCR testing, the rest of 116 samples were stored at -20\u00b0C until mNGS analysis. 117 For sample viral enrichment, a 3-step method was applied to 200\u03bcl of thawed and vortexed 119 sample [20]: low-speed centrifugation (6000g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C), followed by filtration of the 120 supernatant using 0.80 \u00b5m filter (Sartorius, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) to remove eukaryotic and 121 bacterial cells, without loss of large viruses [21] and then Turbo DNase treatment (0.1U/\u03bcL, 122 37 \u00b0C, 90 min; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Total nucleic acid was extracted 123 using the NucliSENS EasyMAG platform (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) followed by 124 an ethanol precipitation (2 hours at -80\u00b0C). As previously described, modified whole 125 transcriptome amplification was performed to amplify both DNA and RNA viral nucleic acids 126 (WTA2, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) [21]. Amplified DNA and cDNA were then 127 purified using a QiaQuick column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and quantified using the Qubit 128 fluorometer HS dsDNA Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Nextera XT 129 DNA Library preparation and Nextera XT Index Kit were used to prepare paired-end 130 libraries, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). 131",
