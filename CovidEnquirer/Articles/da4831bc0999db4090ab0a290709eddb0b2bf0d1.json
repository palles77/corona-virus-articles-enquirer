It has also been identified as an innate immune system component. Most enveloped viruses subject to BST2 restriction bud at the plasma membrane. Here we report our findings that (a) the production of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) progeny viruses, whose budding occurs at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), markedly decreases in the presence of BST2; and (b) BST2 knockdown expression results in enhanced HCoV-229E virion production. Electron microscopy analyses indicate that HCoV-229E virions are tethered to cell surfaces or intracellular membranes by BST2. Our results suggest that BST2 exerts a broad blocking effect against enveloped virus release, regardless of whether budding occurs at the plasma membrane or intracellular compartments.",

Prior to the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak triggered by a previously unknown coronavirus Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) , human coronaviruses (HCoV) 229E and OC43 were recognized as the two primary coronaviruses causing upper respiratory tract infections associated with severe pulmonary diseases in elderly, newborn, and immunocompromised individuals (Garbino et al., 2006) . Results from one study involving a large collection of human nasopharyngeal specimens suggest that HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43 and -HKU1 are the only coronaviruses circulating in human populations (Zlateva et al., 2013) . However, more recent studies of fatal human infections by a novel SARS-like coronavirus named MERS-CoV have been reported (Zaki et al., 2012) . This is a reminder that novel coronaviruses can emerge and cause life-threatening infectious diseases, although most human coronavirus infections result in mild symptoms such as those associated with the common cold.",

When tested with a Vpu-deleted HIV-1 clone (known to be restricted by BST2 in the absence of the Vpu viral protein), the BST2 knockdown resulted in the release of a larger quantity of virus particles (Fig. 1C) ; this is consistent with previous reports (Goffinet et al., 2010; Neil et al., 2008) .",

As expected, the IFN\u03b1 To find out if BST2 expression is induced by infections, we inoculated A549 cells with HCoV-229E at different MOIs. Results indicate barely detectable BST2 following HCoV-229E infection (Fig. 1E ). To determine if the IFN\u03b1-induced decrease in HCoV-229E egress was due to BST2-triggered restrictions, we transiently transfected HCoV-229E-infected A549 cells with BST2-specific siRNA following IFN\u03b1 treatment. Results indicate that BST2 knockdown is capable of elevating HCoV-229E levels in supernatants when normalized to cell-associated N levels (Fig. 1F , lane 7 vs. lane 5). Similar results from independent experiments were observed. BST2 expression in A549 cells was barely induced by IFN\u03b1 following HCoV-229E infection (Fig. 1F , lane 5 vs. lane 2), suggesting that HCoV-229E counteracts the capability of IFN\u03b1 to induce BST2 expression or expresses certain factors against BST2. IFN\u03b1 does not significantly enhance BST2 expression in HCoV-229E-infected cells to restrict virus egress-in other words, the effect of BST2 knockdown on virus egress enhancement is marginal. According to these data, it is difficult to conclude whether HCoV-229E egress is significantly restricted by IFN\u03b1-induced BST2. Our observation of a noticeable reduction in virus egress following IFN\u03b1 treatment ( Fig. 1D ) could be due, at least in part, to the time of sample analysis (see \"Discussion\" section).",

HeLa cells with or without BST2 knockdown were inoculated with HCoV-229E at 0.1 MOI. Virus titers at various times post-infection were determined by A549 cell plaque assays. At 10 h post-infection and later, HeLa cells produced viral titers at levels significantly lower than HeLa/BST2-( Fig. 2A ). Between 7 and 9 h post-inoculation, HeLa/BST2-cells produced higher virus titers, but not at a statistically significant level. Plaque morphologies of A549 cells infected with virions released from HeLa/BST2-or HeLa cells were similar (data not shown). However, we repeatedly observed that the sizes of viral plaques on HeLa/ BST2-cells were larger than those on HeLa cells following HCoV-229E infection, despite the lack of major differences in plaque numbers between the two cell types (Fig. 2B ). Larger plaque sizes observed on HeLa/BST2-cells were likely the result of the spreading of nascent progeny virions to adjacent cells rather than increased susceptibility to HCoV-229E infection. To verify the lack of major impacts of BST2 knockdown on HCoV-229E susceptibility or entry, we examined viral protein expression in both HeLa/BST2and HeLa cells at various times post-HCoV-229E infection. As shown in Fig. 3A , HeLa/BST2-and HeLa cells had approximately equal numbers of fluorescent-positive viral nucleocapsid protein cells at 4 h post-infection. However, at 6 h post-infection and later there was a much larger number of fluorescent-positive HeLa/ BST2-cells compared to HeLa cells-an increase likely due to the spread of nascent progeny virions. These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3B) . Combined, the data suggest that BST2 knockdown does not significantly affect HeLa cell susceptibility to HCoV-229E, but markedly affects progeny virus yields.",

As shown in Fig. 4A , HeLa/BST2-cells produced larger quantities of progeny virions compared to HeLa cells regardless of MOI. The finding that HeLa cells produced a relatively low level of N was likely due to a portion of those cells not being infected, in part because of decreased virus spreading in the presence of BST2 (Fig. 3) . Another possibility is that viral proteins were not fully expressed at 12 h post-infection. To determine whether BST2 restriction of HCoV-229E occurs in the same manner as in other enveloped viruses (i.e., whether virus particles are tethered at the cell surface), we fixed HeLa and HeLa/BST2-cells and observed them with a scanning electron microscope at 12 h post-infection. As shown in Fig. 4B and C, numerous clusters consisting of between 2 and 20 virus particles were found on HeLa cell surfaces. In contrast, most of the virus particles found on HeLa/BST2-cell surfaces were singular and scattered. When treated with the protease subtilisin (which triggers the release of cell surfaceassociated HIV-1 virions by cleaving BST2 (Neil et al., 2007) ), much larger quantities of HCoV-229E or HIV-1 (control) virions were recovered in supernatants (Fig. 4D , lanes 5-6 vs. lanes 3-4). No significant increases in virion quantity were found in HeLa/ BST2-culture supernatant following subtilisin treatment (Fig. 4D , lane 12 vs. lane 14). We also observed that larger amounts of HCoV-229E virions were recovered from HeLa culture medium than from HeLa/BST2-cell culture medium following subtilisin treatment, suggesting that the HeLa cells had larger quantities of virions trapped at the cell surface (Fig. 4D, lane 6 vs. lane 14) . This result is compatible with SEM analysis data showing much smaller quantities of HCoV-229E virions found on the surfaces of HeLa/ HCoV-229E growth kinetics in HeLa and HeLa/BST2 \u00c0 cells. HeLa cells with or without BST2 knockdown were infected with HCoV-229E at 3 MOI. At 7 to 12 h post-infection, serially diluted supernatants were used to infect A549 cells, and viral titers were determined by standard plaque assays ( n, pr 0.05; nn , p r 0.01).

We observed a significant reduction in BST2 expression level tied to a 1.7-fold increase in NL4.3delVpu virus particle production (Fig. 6C) .

This is in agreement with the notion that BST2 is a major component of innate immunity against enveloped virus replicative infections. Both transient and stable expression of BST2 knockdown resulted in the marked enhancement of HCoV-229E progeny virus titer quantities. Electron microscope observations indicate an association with virus particle clusters at cell surfaces in the presence of BST2 (Figs. 4 and 5) . Immunogold labeling results indicate that BST2 molecules enhanced the linking of virions to each other or to cell membranes (Fig. 5) , suggesting that HCoV-229E virions are restricted to membranes by BST2 during budding in ER/Golgi compartments. The primary site of BST2 antiviral activity is thought to be the cell surface, where many viruses acquire their envelopes by directly budding from the plasma membrane (Le Tortorec et al., 2011; Swiecki et al., 2013) . However, some enveloped viruses such as herpesviruses (which complete their final envelopment by obtaining membranes from TGN and/or endosomal compartments and egress via exocytosis), are also subject to BST2 restrictions Mansouri et al., 2009; Mettenleiter, 2002) . Results from one recent study suggest that BST2 can moderately restrict the release of hepatitis C virus (HCV), whose assembly takes place in the ER, and whose release from cells occurs via secretory pathways in a fashion similar to that of coronaviruses (Dafa-Berger et al., 2012; Jones and McLauchlan, 2010) . It is possible that virions linked to vesicle membranes via BST2 association are retained on cell surfaces following the exocytotic fusion of virion-containing vesicles with plasma membranes. This finding, plus the inhibition of enveloped virus budding at the plasma membrane, suggests that BST2 is also capable of inhibiting virus budding at intracellular membranes.",

(2012) report that BST2 restricts hepatis C virus egress, they also found that (a) IFN-induced BST2 expression levels in Huh-7.5 cells remained unchanged when cells were infected with HCV followed by IFN treatment, and (b) HCV At 4 h, culture medium was removed, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with PBS containing subtilisin (1 mg/ml) for 10 min at 37 1C. Supernatants were then harvested and pelleted through 20% sucrose cushions. Pellets and cell lysates were subjected to western immunoblot analyses. HIV-1 was detected with an anti-HIV-1 p24CA antibody, and HCoV-229E was determined with an antibody against the HCoV-229E nucleocapsid (N). infection had little impact on BST2 level in a stable BST2expressing Huh-7.5 cell line, suggesting that HCV lacks the necessary mechanism or mechanisms to counteract BST2. Our results indicate that HCoV-229E infections can significanly reduce BST2 expression and enhace NL4.3delVpu virion release (Fig. 6) , suggesting that HCoV-229E may express anti-BST2 factors. Further, the high BST2 expression level induced by IFN\u03b1 in mock-infected A549 cells was not observed when cells were infected with HCoV-229E (Fig. 1F, lane 2 vs. lane 5) . We have no direct evidence suggesting that HCoV-229E infection can significanly downregulate IFN\u03b1-induced BST2; however, our data suggest that HCoV-229E-infected A549 cells can counteract the ability of IFN\u03b1 to trigger BST2 expression. This scenario is similar to the intial phase of HCoV-229E infection of respiratroy tract cells, which express very low or undetectable levels of basal BST2 (Erikson et al., 2011) . Once cells are infected by HCoV-229E, BST2 expression is downregulated, even in the presence of subsequently induced IFN. As a result, HCoV-229E egress is unrestricted.",

However, total or surface BST2 levels in HeLa cells were markedly reduced at an infection MOI of 5.0 (Fig. 4A, lane 5 and Fig. 6 ). This suggests that BST2 downregulation following HCoV-229E infection is MOIdependent. Bampi et al. have reported the mediation of BST2 degradation by Sendai virus (SeV) glycoproteins; however, significant total BST2 downregulation in HeLa cells at 24 h post-infection requires inoculation at 20 MOI (Bampi et al., 2013) . They therefore concluded that BST2 degradation requires a threshold of viral proteins. It is likely that at shorter time periods post-infection and/or at low MOIs, BST2 antagonist expression by HCoV-229E is insufficient to counteract the effects of BST2. Since HCoV-229E egress becomes unrestricted after longer infection periods, the elevation of virus egress by BST2 knockdown becomes unnecessary. This may explain, at least in part, why we did not observe significant improvement in HCoV-229E egress due to the siRNA knockdown of BST2 at 48 h post-infection (Fig. 1F) ; at this point, IFN\u03b1-induced BST2 may have been neutralized by HCoV-229E. In contrast, the impact of IFN\u03b1-induced BST2 on virus egress was significant in samples analyzed 24 h post-infection (Fig. 1D) .",

            "text": "While BST2 significantly blocks HCoV-229E progeny virus release, it does not completely block HCoV-229E replication. BST2 is one component of innate immune response in the form of restricting enveloped virion release (Sauter et al., 2010) . However, many viruses have evolved specific antagonists to counteract BST2 anti-viral activity-examples include HIV-1 Vpu, HIV-2 Env, simian immunodeficiency virus, Nef and Env, Ebola and Sendai virus GP, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) K5 (Gupta et al., 2009; Jia et al., 2009; Kaletsky et al., 2009; Le Tortorec and Neil, 2009; Mansouri et al., 2009; Neil et al., 2008; Pardieu et al., 2010; Bampi et al., 2013) . Our finding that HCoV-229E infection leads to markedly reduced BST2 expression levels similar to those observed in HIV-1 infections suggests that some HCoV-229E factors are capable of triggering BST2 downregulation. In the case of Fig. 5 . BST2 associates with HCoV-229E virions. HeLa (panels A, B and E-G) or HeLa/BST2-cells (panels C and D) were infected with HCoV-229E at 0.1 MOI. At 12 h postinfection, cells were fixed, prepared, and viewed with a transmission electron microscope. BST2 was probed with rabbit anti-BST2 antiserum, followed by a secondary 10 nm gold conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (panels E-G). Immunogold particles were barely detectable in HeLa/BST2-cells and in HeLa cells not exposed to the primary antibody (data not shown). Arrows indicate virions found on cell surfaces or in vesicles. Bars, 200 nm. HCoV-229E at 5 MOI. At 18 h post-infection, cells were fixed and probed with a rabbit anti-BST2 antibody prior to the permeabilization of cell membranes, followed by a secondary FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. After the permeabilization of cell membranes, HCoV-229E N proteins were probed with a primary anti-HCoV-229E N antibody and a secondary phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry. Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of HCoV-229E-infected samples were compared to those of mock-infected samples. (B) HeLa cells were infected with HCoV-229E at 0.1 MOI. At 18 h post-infection, cells were fixed and permeabilized. BST2 proteins were detected with a mouse anti-BST2 antibody followed by a secondary FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. HCoV-229E N proteins were probed with a primary anti-HCoV-229E N antibody and a secondary rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. BST2 signal (arrows) decreased on the surfaces of HCoV-229E-infected (red) cells. (C) HeLa cells were transfected with NL4.3delVpu. At 4 h post-transfection, cells were replated onto two dish plates and either mock-infected or infected with HCoV-229E at 5 MOI. At 24 h post-infection, cells and culture supernatants were collected and subjected to western immunoblot analysis. Ratios of total Gag protein level in the medium versus cell were calculated by scanning p24gag-associated band densities from immunoblots. The ratio of infected group was normalized to that of mock-infected group. SARS-CoV, IFN expression is suppressed following infection (Narayanan et al., 2008) ; this may promote virus spreading due to its inability to trigger BST2 expression. However, SARS is considered a systemic disease involving many organs (Holmes, 2003) that constitutively express BST2 (Erikson et al., 2011) . It remains to be determined whether SARS-CoV virion release is also restricted by BST2, and whether coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV) have evolved strategies to oppose BST2 anti-viral activity.",

The delVpu mutation construct was subcloned into NL4.3Env-which has the env coding sequence (BglII-nt.7031 to BglII-nt. 7611) partially deleted. Constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequence (5\u2032-CCAggUCUUAAgCgUgAgAAUC-3\u2032) directed against BST-2 was synthesized by MDBio, Inc. To establish BST2 stale knockdown cell lines, pseudotyped lentiviruses containing the BST2 shRNA were generated in 293T cells. Virus-containing supernatants then were used to infect HeLa cells. BST2 knockdown cell lines were selected with puromycin (3 \u03bcg/ml) and screened with western immunoblotting. The lentivirus-based shRNA construct targeting the BST2 gene, NM_004335.2-432s1c1 and lentivirus package plasmids including pCMVDR8.91 and pMD.G (VSV-G) were purchased from National RNAi Core Facility Platform (NRC), Academia Sinica, Taiwan.",

(A) HeLa cells were transfected with BST2-specific siRNA (5 \u03bcg) three times at 54 h, 30 h and 6 h prior to infection with HCoV-229E at 0.1 MOI for 1 h at 37 1C. At 12 h post-infection, cell lysates (bottom) and supernatants (upper) were harvested and subjected to western immunoblotting. Viral proteins were detected with an anti-HCoV229E nucleocapsid (N) antiserum. N proteins from medium or cell samples were quantified by scanning N band density from immunoblots. Ratios of N levels in medium to those in cells were determined and compared with the ratio of mock-infected samples.(B) HeLa cells transduced with shRNA targeting the BST2 gene (HeLa/BST2-) or a non-targeting shRNA (shControl) were infected with HCoV-229E at 0.1 MOI. At 20 h post-infection, cell lysates (bottom) and supernatants (upper) were harvested and subjected to western immunoblotting. (C) HeLa or HeLa/BST2-cells were transfected with the HIV-1 virus-producing vector NL4.3delVpu. At 48 h post-transfection, cells and supernatants were collected, prepared, and analyzed by western immunoblotting. Viral proteins were detected with an anti-HIV-1 p24CA monoclonal antibody. (D) A549 cells were infected with HCoV-229E at 0.1 MOI for 1 h at 37 1C. Cells were treated twice with the indicated concentrations of IFN\u03b1 at 1 h and 24 h post-infection. At 36 h post-infection, cell lysates (bottom) and supernatants (upper) were harvested and subjected to western immunoblotting. Virus titers were determined by plaque assays of A549 cells. nn , p r 0.01. (E) A549 cells were infected with HCoV-229E at the indicated MOIs (lanes 2-5) or treated with IFN\u03b1 (10,000 U/ml). At 24 h post-infection, cells were collected and analyzed by western immunoblotting. (F) A549 cells were transfected with BST2-specific siRNA twice (at 1 h and 24 h) following infection with HCoV-229E at 5.0 MOI for 1 h at 37 1C. Cells were treated twice with the indicated concentrations of IFN\u03b1 at 4 h and 28 h post-infection. At 48 h post-infection, cell lysates and supernatants were harvested and subjected to Western immunoblotting. Viral N proteins from medium or cell lysate samples were quantified by scanning N band densities from immunoblots. The ratios of N levels in medium to those in cells were determined and normalized to the group without siRNA transfection and IFN treatment (lane 4). The lower blot was derived from the upper blot by extending the exposure.",
