This review article evaluates a collection of works on in vitro and biochemical studies of SD. The discourse on the diverse class of chromones and coumarins in SD offers an insight to the pharmacological effects of these bioactive constituents as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, immunoregulatory, antioxidative, and anti-proliferative agents. It is highlighted that there is a structural relationship between the constituents and bioactive activities, which in effect provides a valid reasoning and reaffirm the use of SD in the treatment of the pathologies in Chinese medicine.",

            "text": "Saposhnikoviae divaricata (Turcz.) Schischk (SD), an umbelliferous genus, is widely found in the northern and northeastern territories of China and cultivated in many other areas such as Anhui, Shanxi, and Gansu provinces. It is known as \"Fang Feng\" in China, \"Bou-hu\" in Japan and \"Bangpung\" in Korea. The Chinese terminology of this herb literally translates \"to avert wind\", and the dried roots of this plant is generally applied to treat pathogenic conditions of wind-damp-cold in Chinese medicine (CM). SD is an important component in traditional Chinese medicine clinical practice and commonly used for the treatment of rheumatism, arthralgia, general aches, headaches, stroke, fever, cold, and allergic rhinitis. The Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission [1] ranked SD as a top-grade herb, and it is described to possess pungent, sweet and slight warm properties. SD has a wide spectrum of use in the CM. Its applications are recorded and well established in the CM classical text the Shen Nong's Materia Medica (Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing) which is the oldest pharmaceutical monograph in CM, dating back to Qin-Han dynasty. In the Shen Nong's Materia Medica, SD is graded as a premium-grade herb cited for its multiple effects: immunoprotective capability in warding off cold (also otherwise known as dispelling wind-cold and relieving exterior pathogens in CM), relief of edema-induced pain (expelling dampness from the acupuncture meridians) and anti-spasmogenic activity (expelling wind and relieving convulsion). Similarly, in the Collected Works of Materia Medica (Ben Cao Hui Yan), authored by NI Zhu-Mo in the Ming dynasty, a herbal monograph outlined the multiple use of SD for the treatment of arthritis instilled with dampness, joints pain, tetanus, atrophy and flaccidity of muscles, headaches, cold, fevers, cough, adiaphoresis, nasal congestion, pharyngeal dryness syndrome, cerebrovascular accident, early onset of small pox, and anxiety in children. CM clinicians today still use SD for the same pathologies cited. In response to the pressing need to align CM for an evidence-based approach, there is an emergence of scientific research on the bioactive constituents and the therapeutic effects of SD. Therefore, the objective of this review article is to provide a systematic review of phytochemical, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic perspectives of the experimental studies on SD.",

Papers in English or Chinese language are considered for this review. Scientific rigors were called upon to determine the chemical markers of herbs through the use of strict parameters in testing, quantitative and qualitative measures of the bioactive components, such as fingerprint spectrum, correlations differentiation, and stability evaluation, reference standards, and toxicological assessments. According to the TGA, reporting referencing standards includes naming the origin of the plant materials and its authentication [2] . A plant specimen voucher number (PSVN) is an upmost requirement for referencing standards in botanical testing [3] . It enables traceability of the plant material, allows access to the storage of crude plant for researchers who seek to cross verify data, further scientific investigations or commercial purposes, should there be discrepancies in the drug products produced from the plant source. Essentially, a lack of PSVN essentially thwarts scientific research from the onset and may cause legal repercussions if used for commercial purposes. Attempts to compare bioactive yield outcomes of these studies was unfeasible in this review, owing to differences in extraction weights and yield units used in the papers such as relative standard deviation, microliters or milligrams per liters. The scientific process of reporting chemical profiling by spectroscopic and/or chromatographic fingerprint should include calibration curves that depict the peak area ratio and the percentage of relative abundance of the bioactive compounds yielded from the plant material in study.",

Three new coumarin compounds are discovered to have effects against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV): divaricoumarin A, divaricoumarin B, and divaricoumarin, with molecular formulae being C 25 [10] (Fig. 2) . Among the SD coumarins tested, Praeruptorin B is found to have the strongest effect against PEDV in Vero cells. In vitro results reveal Praeruptorin B is able to inhibit viral replication at the stage of protein syntheses. Although PEDV is essentially a viral infection in pigs, this coronavirus stems from the same family of the human coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome [10] . Praeruptorin B, a coumarin from SD, could potentially offer a novel anti-viral drug research for the intractable human coronavirus diseases. In addition, phenylpropanoid fatty acid ester, defined chemically as (\u00b1)-2-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-methoxypropyl nervonic acid ester and divaricatol are discovered to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse Polyacetylene Panaxynol 1 H-13 C NMR/CC/TLC [8] macrophages RAW 264.7 [4] .

Hamaudol with its algycone portion and ledebouriellol and divaricatol (both pyranochromones) increased pain threshold, by imparting an opioidergic effect experienced in mice when administered with a high dose of GH [8] . Significant writhing inhibition was observed, but no significant hypothermic effect was detected on the pyrexic mice even at a higher dose of 160 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 , and writhing inhibitory effect was easily reversed by naloxone injection [8] . Evidence suggested that the SD analgesic effects were acting on an opioid receptor in the CNS and its pathway, not on the PNS pain-associated inflammation generally produced on the peripheral sensory nerve. These analgesic effects were also detected in a pain threshold tail writhing test with intramuscular injection of GC and GV in murine models at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 . Pain deterrent at higher doses were prolonged with a considerable reduction of spasmodic pain were observed in the models [26] . Anomalin is particularly effective against hyperalgesia and allodynia, exerting strong anti-nociceptive effects after 4 hour at 50 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 , inhibiting carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia [19] . The anti-nociceptive Anti-inflammatory effects GC, C, MV, and anomalin appear to exert considerable inhibition in major inflammatory pathways, namely nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and nitric oxide production. Anti-inflammatory effects of SD chromones were revealed in arthritic rats, including significant decline in the arthritis score for pain and swelling, with a reduction of the inflammatory cytokines levels, although suppression of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 was only observed in rats treated with higher dose of SD [21] . A key indicator in inflammation, prostaglandin 2 (PGE 2 ), was also decreased in both sera and joints. Treatment of SD suppressed the activation of NF-\u03baB binding to its DNA sequences. Deactivation of NF-\u03baB binding was facilitated by the suppressions of signal-transduction inflammation induced by TNF\u03b1-mediated phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38, which is amplified in both collagen-induced arthritic rats and human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (3.2, 2.8, and 2.6 fold, respectively) [21] . The inhibition of MAPKs phosphorylated -ERK, JNK and p38 was due to the action of GC. Among all the MAPK subtypes, p-JNK was discovered to be most effectively suppressed. The same GC inhibitory effects on ERK1/2, JNK and p38 were detected in LPS-induced inflammation in severe acute lung injury and no cytotoxic effect with the 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) of SD-GC from 12.5 to 100 mg\u00b7L \u22121 [16] .",

            "text": "Interestingly, although GC is an inhibitor of NO and iNOS production [16] , both C and MV have stronger effects than GC [14] . SD chromones and anomalin are highly effective against acute and chronic inflammation. Obvious anti-pyretic effects in acute carrageenan paw swelling of rats are associated with SD chromones [18] as well as anomalin [21] , and similar inhibition of chronic complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced edema, with lesions being significantly reduced [18] . Both urine HPLC-MS analysis and titre levels in CFA models indicated that GC and GV were mainly responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects in SD. GC, in particular, counteracted the LPS-induced inflammation in severe pulmonary inflammatory disorder, manifested in acute respiratory distress syndrome [16, 18] . In vivo and in vitro results have demonstrated GC attenuated LPS-induced cytokine levels; TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were far lower in the GC group than that in the control group [14] . Anomalin-mediated inhibitions on iNOS, COX-2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL6 deactivated the transcriptional onset of NF-\u03baB in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells [17] . Cytoplasmic expression of I\u03baB\u03b1 was drastically reduced, along with subunits of NF-\u03baB, p50, p65 and c-rel being translocated; these were marked indications of anomalin obliterating NF-\u03baB-DNA binding activities. Although anomalin was able to interrupt protein synthesis of I\u03baB\u03b1 and phosphorylation, there was no inhibitory effect on the protein initiating factor, eIG2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Anomalin is effective against hyperalgesia and allodynia associated inflammation. Elevated MARK-ERK and p38 signaling and nuclei translocation are precursors to activation of the CREB pathway [27] . Anomalin, besides its ability to deactivate the NF-\u03baB pathway, is also effective in deactivating CREB pathway, which is generally associated with pro-nociceptive mediators that induce prolonged pain in chronic inflammation. MARK-ERK and p-38 expressions are exponentially reduced, abolishing the CREB-DNA binding activity [19] .",

Synergistic effects with the combined treatment of chemotherapeutic agents, CAM or PTX, on the four cancer cells have been demonstrated; SD extracts effectively reduced the IC 50 values of CAM in K562 and HL60 cells and that of PTX in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells (Table 2) , compared with cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents alone. Co-administration of SD with a lower concentration of chemotherapeutic agents could effectively achieve the same anti-proliferative effects as compared to a high cytotoxic concentration of CAM or PTX. However, this antagonistic effect on cell proliferation was highly dependent on the concentrations of SD extracts and the chemotherapeutic agents.

A study evaluated SD with microsomal testosterone 6\u03b2-hydroxylation as an index marker for CYP3A4 activity in response to SD furanocoumarins in human liver [12] . Samples of SD tested had no significant CYP3A4 inhibition.

These SD compounds were deemed to be well absorbed, with 3'-O-angeloylhamaudol and GH being moderate absorbent compounds. Increased linear kinetic curves depicted influx measurement across Cacao-2 monolayer indicated a passive diffusion mechanism for SD compounds, except for GH and 3'-O-angeloylhamaudol. Both compounds possessed a comparably smaller permeability magnitude in the first-pass metabolism. All the bioactive constituents of SD were easily absorbed in the first-pass metabolism and did not seem to manifest any interference with CYP3A4.

The conversion of GC to C was marked by the presence of higher concentration in the blood after absorption. This was indicative that GC is essentially a prodrug of C. GC exhibited low bioavailability, with evidence in its rapid elimination in the concentration-time curve, with t 1/2 being 1.02 \u00b1 0.034 h after oral administration [13] . A delayed double peak occurred in mass spectrometry after the administration of the SD extract at 1.55 and 6.40 h with an increased Area-Under-Curve.

These tissues are responsible for the regeneration of the extracellular matrix of skin manifested in wound healing, tissue repair, and remodeling in response to injury such as myocardial injury, atheroma, arthritis, cancer, and chronic tissue ulcer [32] . One hallmark of cancer proliferation is the result of IL-8 signaling which promotes angiogenesis and metastasis of malignant tumors. Anti-cancer drug designs for MMP inhibitors are aimed at several targets, namely chelating zinc ion at MMP's active sites, inhibiting MMP's enzymatic activity as well as synthesis, and the latest utilizing bisphosphates and D-tryptophan derivatives to inhibit gelatinases [32] . Findings on SD capability to inhibit MMP-2 and MMP-9, along with the discovery that SD indirectly promoted angiogenesis via production of IL-8 were conflicting [22] , had casted questions as to whether effects of SD could be diminished or adulterated when used in a combined herb formula. Nonetheless, merits of GV in SD reflected its high affinity to enzyme MMP-2 and SD chromones' inhibitory effects on IL-8 expressions in the signaling cascade that could potentially halt the tumorigenesis process and curtail MMP-9 activities vigorously. MMP-9 has a distinct role in tumor angiogenesis because it regulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the most potent inducer of tumor angiogenesis and a major therapeutic target [33] . These chromones could potentially be used as a therapeutic intervention in targeting MMP-9 and VEGF downstream effectors and targets, although further study on the mechanisms responsible for the inhibitory effects of SD chromones on MMP-2 and MMP-9 is still needed.",

SD polysaccharides could be used as an immunomodulation agent to treat autoimmune diseases commonly characterized with chronic proinflammatory. Plant-derived polysaccharides are posited to exert an immunomodulatory effect by the binding to specific receptors on immune cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues and activate intracellular signals [34] . The T cell receptors in T cell activation indicate the 'status' of the adaptive immunity. Low ratios of CD4 + and CD8 + are essentially associated with the immunosenescence of the immune system and is also a distinct feature of viral infection such as human immunodeficiency virus, and tuberculosis infections [35] . Lymphocyte subsets CD3+CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ mediate immune response in B cells differentiation and macrophage activation. A recovery of these phenotype biomarkers elicited an immune reconstitution in immunodeficiencies could be facilitated by the SD polysaccharides. The basis of this biologic activity of polysaccharides could possibly lie in the binding of its monosaccharide composition of rhamnose, mannose, glucose, and galactose; promoting sialylated changes on glycoproteins or otherwise reverting to a normalized anti-inflammatory mode in IgG, while an absence of it would promote pro-inflammatory effector function [34] . The potential role of SD polysaccharides could offer promising outcome for chronic persistent infections, in particular, with the elucidation of SD polysaccharides based on chemical-structural relationship to the receptors. This would provide a rational basis for clinical research to develop the novel drugs for autoimmune diseases.",

Coumarins and its derivatives such as 7, 3 hydroxy coumarins and psoralen are known to possess anti-oxidant properties against human cancer cell lines [36] [37] [38] ; it appears that the number of hydroxyl groups on the coumarin correlates with the role as a suppressor of reactive oxygenated species [39] . Structurally, natural products with phenolic groups with at least two polar groups in benzene ring at positions 6, 7 or 7, 8 are postulated to possess apoptotic properties while presence of hydroxyl groups at positions 5, 6, 7, and 8 of aromatic nucleus exhibit anti-inflammatory properties of hydroxycoumarins [40] . As part of the umbelliferae family, SD contains many natural coumarins and some of the SD pyranocoumarins substitution pattern indicated for praeruptorin F, cis-3'-isovaleryl-4'-acetylkhellactone, praeruptorin B, cis-3', 4'-disenecioylkhellactone, cis-3'-isovaleryl-4'-senecioylkhellactone, (\u2212)-cis-khellactone were at C-8/C-1'/C-3'/0/C-7, with divaricoumarins at C7 and C8 [10] . Moreover, strong synergistic interactions were also featured when pyranocoumarins were combined with common anti-tumor drugs such as vincristine, doxorubicin, and PTX [41] . These structural properties of SD engender anti-neoplastic attributes that could pose as an anti-cancer drug or an adjuvant in mainstream therapeutics with lowered cytotoxicity for chemotherapeutics. In view of this recommendation, future clinical research needs to pave the way to understand the mechanism of combining natural products as mainstream medicine.",

Metabolism of drugs is influenced by cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Drug interaction with CYP450 enzymes could pose as potential inhibitor or an inducer of the drug with actions of decreasing or nullifying or even amplifying the enzyme activity. No drug to drug interference was present when SD was co-administered with chemotherapeutic agents CAM and PTX. Passive diffusion in absorption and elimination was associated with almost all of the SD compounds. Particularly, SD chromone C manifested lingering absorption and elimination in AUC [13] , a striking characteristic which highlighted naturally derived C from SD, engendered a slow onset of bioactivity and prolonged pharmacological effects. This hallmark is synonymous to properties of Chinese herbal medicine.",
