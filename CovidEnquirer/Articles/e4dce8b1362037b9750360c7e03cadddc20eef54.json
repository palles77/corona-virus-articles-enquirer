For enveloped viruses, attachment is mediated by glycoproteins which form spikes projecting outward from the virion's surface. The polypeptide backbone of the spike glycoprotein is encoded by virus-specific genes and these proteins are extensively modified after synthesis by host-cell-specific enzymes. Most of the protein mass lies outside the virion's lipid bilayer but a short sequence of hydrophobic amino acids within the protein spans the bilayer, thereby anchoring the spikes to the membrane.",

We do not intend this to be a comprehensive accounting of the virus glycoprotein literature, and have selected a few virus glycoproteins which we feel provide prototypes for illustrating important relationships between the functions cited above and glycoprotein structure. One of the major advances in our knowledge about virus glycoproteins has come from the application of recombinant DNA technology, which led to a determination of the primary structure of many virus glycoproteins as well as to information about the role of various amino acid sequences in glycoprotein FIG. 1. A typical transmembranal virus glycoprotein. Some proteins have a reversed orientation with their amino terminus inside and the carboxy terminus outside the virion. The distribution of polypeptide sequences between the ecto-and cytoplasmic domain can also vary greatly; however, the transmembranal domain usually consists of about 20 to 25 hydrophobic amino acids. Most proteins have oligosaccharide groups (0) bound only to asparagine but others have glycosyl residues attached to serine and threonine as well. A posttranslational proteolytic cleavage (noted by A) converts many virus glycoproteins into disulfide-linked dimers. In addition these polypeptides often exist in their native state as oligomers (dimers, trimers, tetramers) , held together by strong nonconvalent protein-protein interactions. localization and function. The amino acid sequences for those glycoproteins discussed here will not be presented; instead we consider these proteins in terms of their structural domains. Figure 1 illustrates these domains and their assigned functions. One set of domains we shall not discuss in depth are those regions of glycoproteins mapped as antigenic determinants or epitopes. An article in a recent volume of this series describes in detail influenza virus glycoprotein antigenic sites and their variability (Air and Laver, 1986) .",

            "text": "The typical HA protein is initially synthesized as a molecule of 566 amino acids; however, the 16 amino acids at the amino terminus constitute a signal peptide and are cleaved shortly after the complete polypeptide is made. Oligosaccharides are added to asparagine residues at six to seven sites along the chain during synthesis; most of these are attached to the amino-terminal portion of the protein and are on the stalk of the HA trimer. They are also in other regions and can influence the receptor-binding and fusion activities. Processing of these glycosyl residues occurs shortly after their attachment and such modifications can profoundly influence the conformation of the protein (see Section IV,A,l). A model for the folding of this large protein is found in the analysis of the X-ray crystal structure (Wilson et al., 1981) . Six disulfide bridges form during folding and prior to a critical, single proteolytic cleavage in a highly conserved region of HA at a site Wilson et al., 1981.) 221 amino acids from the carboxy terminus. A protease in the Golgi stacks converts HA to a disulfide-linked dimer of HA1 with 328 and HA2 with 221 residues. A few additional amino acids are removed from the carboxy terminus of HA1. An important event during processing is the formation of HA1-HA2 trimers which are stabilized through a-helical-coiled coils and salt bridges in the stalk region of the protein. Changes in antigenic properties of HA have been detected during these processing events (Bachi et al., 1985; Nestorowicz et al., 1985) .",

            "text": "HA has a cryptic fusogenic activity but two changes must occur before this protein can fuse membranes. First, there must be a proteolytic cleavage at a lysine (arginine) at position 328, which produces the disulfide-linked HA1 and HA2 chains (Klenk et al., 1975; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975) . This cleavage is accompanied by conformational changes in the protein's structure since the amino terminus of HA2 and the carboxy terminus of HA1 move some 21 A apart. In addition, the HA2 amino terminus folds into the interior of the HA trimer. The importance of this cleavage and subsequent fusogenic activity to influenza virulence has recently been noted as a result of examining the HAS from virulent forms of a chicken influenza virus. Although cells infected with the virulent A/chick/Penn/83 (H5N2) could cleave HA to HA1 and HA2, the avirulent form of this virus has an HA that required exogenously added trypsin for cleavage (Kawaoka et al., 1984) . At least one epitope is different between the virulent and avirulent types (Robertson et al., 1985) . Amino acid sequences are not different between HAS in the region of the connecting HA1-HA2 peptide, but the molecular weight of the virulent HA1 appears lower than the avirulent strain except when glycosylation was blocked by tunicamycin, a result indicating that there is one less oligosaccharide in the virulent HA. Four amino acids are changed between avirulent and virulent types and one of these, at position 13 of HA1 located near the HA1-HA2 connecting peptide, is postulated to alter a glycosylation site such that the HA1-HA2 cleavage site now becomes accessible. The actual cleavage sequence contains dibasic amino acids, which are sites for limited proteolysis in a wide variety of proteins including other enveloped virus glycoproteins, peptide hormones, and neuropeptide precursors. The proteolytic activity is localized to a trans-Golgi vesicle (Morrison et al., 1985) and is possibly the calcium-activated, thiol-type protease described by Steiner et al. (1984) .",

Furthermore, an analogous sequence of very hydrophobic amino acids is found in the fusion proteins of all paramyxoviruses (Spear, 1986) , indicating that this site is essential for fusion. This hypothesis is now strongly supported by two separate studies of HA variants that fuse at pH values significantly above that of the wild type. In one series of analyses, variants were selected by growth in chorioantoic membranes treated with amantadine hydrochloride to raise the endosomal pH (Daniels et al., 1985) . After two passages and plaquing on chicken embryo fibroblasts in the presence of the drug, a number of isolates hemolyzed red blood cells at pH values 0.2 to 0.8 greater than the wild-type HA. Changes in amino acid sequences of 41 variants were analyzed with regard to their sites in the quaternary structure of the trimer.

            "text": "The other set of experiments consisted of performing in uitro sitedirected mutagenesis in regions of the cDNA encoding the HA2 amino terminus (Gething et al., 1986) . Three substitutions were made: glutamic acid for glycine at positions 1 and 4 and glycine to glutamic acid at position 11. A glutamic acid at the amino terminus blocked all fusogenic activity, although the HA bound to lipid at lower pH and became protease sensitive. This finding indicates that this HA could still be structurally altered, possibly as a result of dissociation to a monomeric form. Substituting a charged residue at position 4 destabilized HA and led to an increased threshold pH (5.6 compared to 5.3 for normal HA) but a 50% loss in \"efficiency\" of fusion. The glycine replacement at position 11 extended the hydrophobic character of the HA2 another seven amino acids. This had little effect on HA stability but interfered with the ability of this HA to cause cell-cell fusion. All of these results suggest a dual role for the fusion site. One is coincident with an exposure of the hydrophobic sequence as the trimers \"relax\" and possibly dissociate; a second is an interaction of the polypeptide with lipid, producing a destabilization and coalescence of bilayers. A two-step kinetic mechanism of HA-mediated fusion has been proposed by Van Meer et al. (1985) in which a rapid association of the two membranes is followed by the actual fusion at a rate varying with lipid composition.",

A tentative identification of this site is described for the three-dimensional structure (Wilson et al., 1981) and consists of a pocket on the surface of HA at the distal end of the spike in the HA1 subunit (see Fig. 2 ). Assignment of this region is based on the observation that a variety of HA sequences show a strong conservation for five distinctive amino acids located in the same topological position in the HA structure. More recent analyses of HA variants which differ in their recognition of two different sialic acid structures confirm the assignment of the receptor site (reviewed in Air and Laver, 1986) . The variants differ in amino acid 226 of HA1, which is in the postulated surface pocket. Other sites at positions adjacent to the pocket also influence receptor structure since variants with changes in these positions show differences in agglutinating red blood cells containing three distinct sialic acids: N-acetyl-, N-glycolyl-, and N-O-diacetylneuraminic acids (Higa et al., 1985) .",

One major difference, a decrease in the oligosaccharide content of the egggrown virus, arose as a result of an amino acid substitution that removed an HA1 glycosylation site adjacent to the receptor site. A glycosylation site is also lost from HA1 in a variant of influenza A WSN strain that is selected during passage of virus on Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells (Deom et al., 1986) .

The evidence that this region of the glycoprotein tethers the molecule to the lipid bilayer comes from in vitro constructed deletion mutants that remove the carboxy-terminal hydrophobic sequences (Gething and Sambrook, 1982) . A cDNA containing a partial copy of the RNA gene for HA from influenza A/Japan/305/57 was inserted into an SV40 vector and monolayers of CV-1 cells infected with virus stocks prepared so they contained helper and recombinant viruses. The particular cDNA used for the analysis had altered sequences near the 3' end of the gene which replaced in the HA the last 38 amino acids at the carboxy terminus with 11 amino acids that were predominantly hydrophilic. When expressed in the monkey cells, the truncated HA was secreted into the culture medium. HA cDNAs have also been inserted into bovine papilloma virus plasmids and these vectors used for isolation of cell lines which constitutively make the HA proteins. The 3' truncated cDNA encodes a protein that was secreted, but that coding for the normal HA made a glycoprotein that was retained at the surface of the cells . Additional mutants of HA with deletions and insertions in the region containing the anchor sequences have been constructed from cDNAs of HA (Sveda et al., 1982) and SV40 vectors carrying these cDNAs expressed in African monkey kidney cells. Normal HAS were completely cell associated but varying amounts (one-fourth to two-thirds) of mutant HAS were secreted from the cells, and mutant and wild-type HAS were differently glycosylated. Another HA mutant that had a totally different carboxy-terminal sequence beginning near the membrane domain of HA2 was retained inside the cell . Clearly, it is possible to affect glycoprotein transport and sorting (see below) by modifying large portions of the membrane domain.",

Arg-Ile-Cys-Ile) are highly conserved among HAS of different strains of influenza, suggesting a critical role in HA function. This sequence is not essential, however, for synthesis and transport of the glycoprotein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface and rather extensive changes can occur in the cytoplasmic domain without seriously altering intracellular transport (Doyle et al., 1985) . These results emerged from in vitro constructions of the HA cDNA in which the carboxy-terminal sequences were mutated to highly diverse structures. The HA cDNA was inserted into the SV40 genome such that high levels of expression occurred and sufficient HA was produced to measure cellular location, state of processing, and fusogenesis as well as hemagglutinating properties of the surface glycoprotein. The most subtle change of three amino acid substitutions (Arg to Ser, Cys to Glu, and Ile to Arg) in the carboxy terminus had no effect on synthesis and transport. A more drastic change in sequence and an elongation of six amino acids, as a result of substituting the cytoplasmic tail of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) glycoprotein cytoplasmic sequence, also had no effect on transport. Some partial effects were noted in those cytoplasmic tails truncated to three amino acids or extended by 22 amino acids with RSV cytoplasmic sequences. However, extension with 16 amino acids from a bacterial plasmid sequence did interfere with transport of HA from the ER. Another random 16-amino acid sequence also blocked transport, but only after the protein reached the Golgi network.",

In addition a carboxy-terminal 6-kDa cyanogen bromide peptide isolated from fowl plague virus contains palmitate. Removal of the bound fatty acid from fowl plague virus or isolated HAS by hydroxylamine inhibits HA-induced hemolysis under conditions that do not affect hemagglutination titers or cause gross morphological change in virus structure or HA conformation (Schmidt and Lambrect, 1986) . Neuraminidase activity of virions is unaffected by the hydroxylaminolysis which blocks fusogenic function; however, until the deacylated HA can be restored to function by reacylation, the conclusion that acyl groups are required for fusion must be a tentative one.",

The two major glycoproteins ( E l and E2) encoded by these viruses are initially expressed as a polyprotein (Strauss and Strauss, 1986) . Nascent proteolytic cleavages produce a precursor of E2 (P62) and E l . The two glycoprotein genes are separated by a sequence encoding a 55-amino acid peptide. The E l protein has 439 amino acids with two extended regions of hydrophobic amino acids. The P62 has 487 amino acids and 64 of these are removed during the proteolytic conversion to E2. E l and E2 form a relatively tight, noncovalent heterodimer, and three of these heterodimers are arranged in triangular clusters on the virion's surface (Harrison, 1986) . Figure 3 illustrates the El-E2 spike with four distinct domains. The P62 contains a hydrophobic sequence of 19 amino acids at the amino terminus of the nascent polypeptide, which functions as a signal sequence for insertion and transfer of this protein into the ER lumen. Unlike most signal sequences, however, the P62 sequence is glycosylated at an asparagine residue in the middle of the sequence and there is no release of this sequence by signal peptidase. In addition, a significant fraction of the P62 molecules are acetylated at the amino-terminal residue (Bell et al., 1982) . For insertion of the E l protein through the ER membrane, there is a separate signal sequence which consists of the carboxy-terminal one-third part of a 6-kDa peptide located between the P62 and E l genes . The 6-kDa peptide does not appear in the virion (Welch and Sefton, 1979) . Early (immature) forms of P62 and E l can be distinguished from the E2 and E l structures on the virion by appropriate monoclonal antibodies (Roehrig et al., 1982; Schmaljohn et al., 1983; Burke et al., 1983) . In addition, the weak protein-protein interactions between P62 and E l become much stronger when P62 is converted to E2 (Rice and Strauss, 1982; Ziemiecki and Garoff, 1978) . Transport of E l from the ER to the cell surface is facilitated by the presence of P62 (Hashimoto et al., 19811, but P62 can traverse the secretory pathway in the absence of E l .",

The regions of the glycoprotein assigned to this function are postulated to consist of a conserved, hydrophobic amino acid sequence between positions 45 and 58 of the E l subunit (Rice and Strauss, 1981) . With SFV, in addition to low pH, fusion requires cholesterol or related P-hydroxysterols embedded in the target membrane (Kielian and Helenius, 1985; White and Helenius, 1980) . Dependence on cholesterol was noted earlier for the binding of low-pH-treated Sindbis virus to liposomes (Mooney et al., 1975) . At low pH, irreversible changes occur in the conformation of both E l and E2 of SFV (Kielian and Helenius, 1985) and the E2 of Sindbis virus . Additional information comes from analysis of water-soluble forms of the El-E2 complex released from their membrane anchor domains by brief protease treetment (Kielian and Helenius, 1985) . The soluble complex has much weaker heterodimer binding and monomeric E2 could be studied. E l retained a resistance to protease after low pH but only in the presence of membrane cholesterol, suggesting a binding of cholesterol to the E l hydrophobic sequence near its amino terminus. At low pH, the water-soluble form of E2 becomes somewhat hydrophobic but is still unable to bind to liposomes.",

Isolated preparations of E l from Western equine encephalitis virus reconstituted into lipid bilayers are able to lyse erythrocytes (Yamamoto et al., 1981) . Antibodies specific to E l can inhibit fusion (Chanas et al., 19821 , and monoclonal antibodies have been found that recognize an E l epitope appearing after low pH (Schmaljohn et al., 1983) .

            "text": "In common with most virus transmembranal glycoproteins, the membrane domains for the alphavirus consist of 20-30 hydrophobic amino acids close to the carboxy terminus of the polypeptide and have basic amino acids at the cytoplasmic face of the bilayer. For SFV E2, the membrane domain could be replaced by an analogous region of the VSV G or the fowl plague virus hemagglutinin, yielding chimeric transmembranal proteins which are transported to the cell surface and retain fusogenic capacity (Riedel, 1985) . Other site-directed mutations in the P62/E2 cDNA have been constructed to determine effects of inserting a single charged amino acid (i.e., glutamic acid) in the middle of the domain and of removing the positively charged amino acids at the cytoplasmic face of the bilayer . For the latter, the wild-type sequence of Arg-Ser-Lys was changed to Gly-Ser-Glu or Gly-Ser-Met. When expressed in mammalian cells in constructs that also contained E l sequences or lacked them, the three mutants were translocated and glycosylated, and reached the cell surface at efficiencies similar to the wild-type P62/E2, regardless of whether E l was present or absent. At the surface, they retained fusogenic activity after low pH treatment, like the wild-type protein. They were nondefective in P62 proteolytic processing except in the absence of E l when, like the wild type, cleavage did not occur but transport of P62 alone to the cell surface was observed. One major difference was detected between the mutants and wild type when membranes were treated at pH 11.5: at this pH, only 10% of the wildtype glycoprotein was released but 4 0 4 0 % of the mutant proteins were lost from the membranes. These results show that a hydrophobic sequence alone, in the absence of cytoplasmic charged groups, can stop the translocation process and that the basic amino acids contribute to anchorage stability. The lack of effect of the glutamic acid in the middle of the membrane domain is puzzling and raises the possibility that a nonhelical conformation with fewer amino acids can span the lipid bilayer. The alterations tested in these experiments apparently do not affect those P62-El interactions that are needed for proteolytic cleavage and E l transport.",

The cytoplasmic domain is not essential for intracellular transport, since cDNAs with deletions in this domain express a P62 which moves to the cell surface .

            "text": "The spikes covering the surface of the vesicular stomatitis and rabies virions are composed of a single species of glycoprotein, the G protein. The amino acid sequences of these G proteins have been deduced from cDNA sequences, rabies G by Anilionis et al. (1981) and VSV G by Rose and Gallione (1981) . Both proteins are similar in size; the rabies (ERA) G has 523 amino acids and the VSV (San Juan) has 511 amino acids. A comparison of the two sequences shows only a 20% identity with the introduction of seven gaps. There are, however, several regions including those of the carboxy-terminal glycosylation site that show a stronger homology . These two proteins contain amino-terminal signal sequences that are removed during synthesis of the polypeptide and they are oriented so their carboxy termini form the cytoplasmic domain. There is little information about the tertiary structure of these glycoproteins but studies using cross-linking reagents indicate that the G on the surface of VSV is a trimer (Dubovi and Wagner, 1977; Mudd and Swanson, 1978) . More recent results obtained with VSV-infected cells show the presence of G oligomers (Kreis and Lodish, 1986). A soluble form of G that is monomeric is produced by treatment of VS virions with cathepsin D at pH 5 (Crimmins et al., 1983) . Although exposure to low pH could be responsible for dissociation of an oligomer, G protein solubilized from virions with octyl-6-glucoside also appears to be monomeric (Crimmins et al., 1983) . The finding that these treatments of VSV produce a monomeric form of G can be reconciled with the data indicating that G is a n oligomer if interactions between monomers are weak. Such interactions may be analogous to those that occur between the trimers on the surface of alphavirus virions which are disrupted by nonionic detergents (Harrison, 1986) . The subunits of the trimer consist of E1-E2 heterodimers that are stable to nonionic detergents.",

The first step in processing, the removal of the three glucose residues, occurs shortly after completion of the polypeptide chain while the protein is still in the ER. The synthesis of complex oligosaccharides involves the removal of all but three of the mannose residues and the addition of N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, sialic acid, and fucose. These reactions take place in the Golgi vesicles.",

The effects of this drug on VSV depend on which strain of the Indiana serotype is analyzed (Gibson et al., 1979; Chatis and Morrison, 1981) . The two strains, VSV (San Juan) and VSV (Orsay), have related but distinct polypeptides. In the presence of tunicamycin, virus yields for both strains are severely inhibited at 38\u00b0C. At 30\u00b0C the yield of VSV (San Juan) is still inhibited by tunicamycin but that of VSV (Orsay), containing nonglycosylated G protein, is nearly equal to that in the absence of drug. The retention of VSV (Orsay) production at 30\u00b0C correlates with the ability of the nonglycosylated G to fold correctly at the lower temperature (Gibson et ul., 1979) . Thus, in the absence of carbohydrate, the folding of G protein becomes temperature sensitive, but the sensitivity depends on the amino acid sequence of the protein. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of G (San Juan) and G (Orsay) reveals a difference of nine amino acids in the ectodomain (Gallione and Rose, 1985) . Four of these represent an increase in hydrophilic amino acids in G (Orsay). Rose and Gallione pointed out that at position 179, which is six amino acids from the glycosylation site, there is a tyrosine in G (San Juan) and an aspartic acid in G (Orsay). The presence of more hydrophilic amino acids may explain why the oligosaccharide requirement for G (Orsay) is less stringent than that of G (San Juan).",

            "text": "The role of oligosaccharides in determining the proper localization and function of the G protein has also been analyzed using cell mutants and drugs that affect the processing pathways. The importance of the structure of the oligosaccharides on G to the formation of VSV was first seen in a mutant cell line which transfers Glc,Man,GlcNAc, instead of the normal precursor to nascent polypeptides (Gibson et al., 1981) . The yield of VSV is temperature sensitive in this mutant and VSV (San Juan) is more temperature sensitive than VSV (Orsay). Recently, the drugs l-deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine were found to inhibit the glucosidases which act at the initial stages of oligosaccharide processing (Saunier et al., 1982; Saul et al., 1983; Pan et al., 1983) . To determine if these early processing events and some of the following steps in oligosaccharide processing are critical for certain proteins, the yields of VSV (San Juan) and VSV (Orsay) in the presence of these drugs and in cell variants altered in the processing pathway were measured (Schlesinger et al., 1984) . These studies show that a block in the removal of the glucose residues by l-deoxynojirimycin, by castanospermine, or by growth in a cell mutant lacking glucosidase I1 inhibits the yields of VSV (San Juan), but not of VSV (Orsay), at 40\u00b0C. Inhibition of later oligosaccharide processing steps has no effect on virus yield. In these experiments, the G protein reaches the cell surface, indicating that the alteration in the G protein is insufficient to prevent migration to the cell surface, but is significant enough to prevent virion formation. The finding that it is only the initial processing of the oligosaccharide that affects the formation of VSV suggests that the structure of the oligosaccharide plays an important role in the folding of the polypeptide chain. By the time the glucose residues have been removed, the polypeptide has achieved a conformation that is no longer influenced by the oligosaccharide structure. The effect of l-deoxynojirimycin on a number of other glycoproteins is consistent with this conclusion, since some glycoproteins such as the hemagglutinin of influenza virus and IgM are not affected by this drug (Burke et al., 1984; Peyrieras et al., 19831 , while other glycoproteins, for example IgD (Peyrieras et al., 19831, acetylcholine receptor (Smith et al., 19861, and al-proteinase (Gross et al., 19831 , are affected.",

The cell surface expression of G protein from cloned cDNA is sufficient to cause cell-cell fusion if the cells are subjected to a brief treatment at acid pH (Riedel et al., 1984; Florkiewicz and Rose, 1984) . The effect of low pH on the conformation of G has not been examined in detail, but a reversible conformation change in the cathepsin D-treated, solubilized form of G is observed when the protein is acidified to pH 5 (Crimmins et al., 1983) . Schlegel and Wade (1984) found that a 25-amino acid peptide corresponding to the amino terminus of the G protein is a pHdependent hemolysin. Antibodies prepared against this peptide are nonneutralizing, but react with denatured protein. This result suggests that the amino terminus is buried in the native protein and may become exposed upon acidification. Further studies by Schlegel and Wade (1985) with smaller peptides identified the six amino-terminal amino acids as the hemolytic domain, a result supported by the observation that a single amino acid change of a lysine to glutamic acid at the amino terminus abolished the peptide's hemolytic activity. However, when the amino terminus of the G is changed by site-directed mutagenesis of the G cDNA to give the same amino terminus as the inactive peptide, the intact G protein retains its pH-dependent fusion activity (Woodgett and Rose, 1986) . Thus, the domain in intact G responsible for fusion has yet to be identified.",

The first suggestions that acetylcholine receptors might act as receptors for rabies virus came from the observation that rabies virus was distributed on mouse diaphragms and cultured chick myotubes coincident with the receptor (Lentz et al., 1982) . Furthermore, binding of virus to these tissues was prevented by a-bungarotoxin, a n irreversible inhibitor of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Lentz et al. (1984) found a significant degree of homology between the sequences of neurotoxins and the rabies glycoprotein. There is a 50% identity between residues 189 to 214 of the glycoprotein and alignment positions 30 to 56 of the neurotoxins. These findings raise the possibility that the neuronal cell tropism and resulting pathogenesis of rabies virus may be due to the affinity of the viral glycoprotein for the acetylcholine receptor. Lentz (1985) pointed out, however, that the acetylcholine receptor is not the only receptor for rabies virus since cells lacking this receptor are susceptible to the virus. The similarity between a domain of the rabies glycoprotein and that of neurotoxins may reflect an evolutionary relatedness between this viral protein and a cellular protein.",

Protease digestion of microsomes prepared from VSV-infected cells removes only 20-30 amino acids from the carboxy terminus, presumably because the rest of the protein is buried inside the microsomes (Katz et al., 1977; Chatis and Morrison, 1979) .

They generated specific deletions and also changed a specific amino acid. In those examples in which the transmembrane region is shortened, G proteins containing 18,16, or 14 amino acids are still able to be transported to the cell surface. When this region contains only 12 or 8 amino acids the G protein still spans the bilayer but it is transported only to Golgi-like regions. A mutant in which the transmembrane sequence is deleted is only detected in the cell in the ER and behaves much the same as the form of G protein lacking both the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Secretion of the former, however, has a half-time of about 12 hours which is much slower than that of the latter which is about 2-4 hours (Rose and Bergmann, 1982) . Adams and Rose (198513) also altered the membrane-spanning domain by replacing an isoleucine with either glutamine or arginine. The substitution of glutamine for isoleucine has no effect on membrane anchoring or localization to the cell surface. When arginine is the substituted amino acid, however, the protein still spans the membrane but is transported poorly to the cell surface.",

The fused protein becomes membrane bound, does not reach the cell surface membrane, and appears to remain in the Golgi. Guan et al.

Although it was not possible to calculate the percentage of the protein that reached the cell surface, the authors did find that iodination of the singly glycosylated protein was at least 10-fold higher and that of the doubly glycosylated protein 34-fold greater than the iodination of the original, nonglycosylated protein.",

Although tunicamycin treatment does affect the transport of many glycoproteins to the cell surface, there are a significant number of membrane proteins that do reach the cell surface in the absence of glycosylation (Gibson et al., 1980) . If carbohydrate acts as a specific recognition signal, it can do so only for a subset of glycoproteins. The result described above in which two different VSV G proteins behave differently when they are not glycosylated (Gibson et al., 1979) complicates any attempt to divide membrane glycoproteins into such subsets. The finding that an oligosaccharide chain at different sites on a polypeptide permits cell surface transport is difficult to interpret in the absence of a three-dimensional structure of the protein. The explanation that an oligosaccharide chain can have effects on the folding, conformation, or stability of some proteins provides an interpretation that encompasses all of the data so far described.",

Rose and Bergmann (1983) altered this domain by creating deletion mutants and in some cases constructing plasmids such that a stretch of amino acids derived from SV40 was added to the carboxy-terminal tail. These altered sequences are shown in Fig. 4 . Two criteria were used to analyze the effect that these changes had on the ability of the G protein to migrate to the cell surface. The first was the rate at which the protein oligosaccharides become resistant to endoglycosidase H (Endo H). Endo H cleaves highmannose oligosaccharide chains but not complex oligosaccharides from the polypeptide chain. The acquisition of the complex sugars (Nacetylglucosamine and galactose) converts the oligosaccharide to an Endo H-resistant form and this event occurs in the Golgi apparatus; thus, the loss of Endo H sensitivity can be correlated with the move- mutationally altered derivatives. The predicted amino acid sequence of the carboxy terminus of the VSV G protein is shown on the top line with the hydrophobic transmembrane segment indicated by the first 21 amino acids. Below this are the predicted amino acid sequences of the G proteins specified by the deletion mutants, in which the dotted line indicates the presence of normal G protein sequence followed by the new amino acid residues encoded by SV40 nucleotide sequences. Deletions are numbered by the nucleotide residue in the G mRNA (Rose and Gallione, 1981) to which the deletion extends. The nucleotide sequence shown at the bottom is the vector sequence to which each of the deletions is joined via the indicated XhoI linker sequence. The sequence GATC at the junction is derived from filling in of the BamHI site. The origin of the \"extra\" sequences in the deleted G proteins is illustrated by the translation of this SV40 sequence in the three possible reading frames. The predicted sequences of the carboxy termini of the deleted G proteins, which should be synthesized after insertion of HpaI and XbaI linkers, are shown with the sequences specified by each of the parent plasmids. The nucleotide sequences a t the junction of the VSV G sequence with the linker are indicated along with the predicted protein sequences for each junction. The sequence shown in lowercase resulted from filling in of the BamHI site in pSVGL2. The asterisk indicates translation termination sites. The approximate half-times required for the oligosaccharides on each of the proteins to become resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion is given.

            "text": "These studies demonstrate an important role for the cytoplasmic domain of the G protein in the proper localization of this protein. One possibility is that the cytoplasmic domain can affect the oligimerization of the protein and thus the conformation of the G polypeptide. Alternatively, there is increasing evidence that integral membrane proteins are transported between organelles via vesicles. Rose and Bergmann suggested that the cytoplasmic domain could influence the transport of G to sites in ER where membrane vesicles form or that the formation of membrane vesicles is affected by the structure of the cytoplasmic tail. VSV G, in common with many membrane glycoproteins, contains fatty acids covalently bound to the cytoplasmic domain (see Schlesinger, 1985) . Acylation occurs posttranslationally in the ER with transfer from palmitoyl-CoA (Berger and Schmidt, 1985) to a cysteine. The identification of this amino acid as the acceptor site on the polypeptide comes from a series of studies based on both the stability of the acyl-protein's linkage and site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Magee et al. (1983) noted that the fatty acids are removed from the protein by treatment with neutral hydroxylamine, a reaction indicative of a labile thioester bond, and the deacylated G forms disul-fide-linked dimers. Disulfide-linked oligomers of Sindbis virus E1-E2 proteins are detected under similar deacylation conditions. Rose et al. (1984) used the cDNA of G to change the cysteine codon in the cytoplasmic domain of VSV (Indiana) to serine and showed that this mutated form of G was not acylated. The nonacylated G is transported to the cell surface membrane; thus, acylation is not essential for intracellular localization. Schlesinger and Malfer (1982) showed that blocking the acylation in VSV-infected cells with the antibiotic cerulenin does not inhibit G movement to the cell surface but does prevent virus budding. These data indicate that acylation has an important function but it is not clear yet what that function is. There are strains of VSV, in particular those of the New Jersey serotype, that replicate perfectly well and their G proteins are not acylated (Kotwal and Gosh, 1984) .",

The most detailed information about these viruses and their glycoproteins has been obtained for the avian, murine, and, in recent years, human retroviruses. The glycoproteins of retroviruses share many of the characteristics of those viral glycoproteins in which the amino-terminal domain is exposed on the surface (Fig. 1) . The synthesis and overall structure of different retrovirus glycoproteins appear similar; the major difference is in the size of the polypeptide. Retrovirus glycoproteins are translated from a spliced subgenomic RNA (Hayward, 1977; Mellon and Duesberg, 1977; Weiss et al., 1977) . The primary product, synthesized on membranebound polyribosomes, is a glycosylated precursor of large molecular weight, 92,000 for Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and 90,000 for murine leukemia virus (MuLV) (see Dickson et al., 1982, for review) . This precursor is cleaved to produce gp85 and gp37, and gp70 and p15E from the avian and murine protein, respectively. The cleaved polypeptides are covalently bound by disulfide bridges (Leamnson and Halpern, 1976) . The larger amino-terminal fragments (gp85 or gp70) are heavily glycosylated; there are 14 potential glycosylation sites on gp85 of Rous sarcoma virus, all of which are thought to be glycosylated Hunter et al., 1983) . The smaller polypeptides (gp37 or p15E) are derived from the carboxy terminus of the precursor and comprise the membrane spanning and cytoplasmic domains of the glycoproteins. Some sequences in p15E are highly conserved among retroviruses, and the isolated p15E is reported to be immunosuppressive (Cianciolo et al., 1984 (Cianciolo et al., ,1985 . It is of considerable interest that a synthetic peptide of 17 amino acids, corresponding to a highly homologous region, is able to mimic this immunosuppressive activity (Cianciolo et al., 1985) .",

Rous sarcoma viruses have been classified into five subgroups based on their ability to infect genetically defined chicken cells (Weiss, 1982) .

Strong support for this model comes from their finding that Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease cleaves the SFFV glycoprotein to yield the amino-terminal V-1 fragment and the carboxy-terminal V-2 fragment. The cleavage occurs at Glu-238, located within the proline-rich region. This region also marks the division between the ecotropic sequences (V-2) and the xenotropic sequences (V-1). The position at which the amino acid sequences of the glycoprotein become strongly homologous to murine leukemia viral glycoprotein sequences occurs exactly at the end of the proline-rich stretch. There are several other results supporting the model that V-1 and V-2 are independent domains.

The enu genes of two nonleukemogenic mutants were molecularly cloned and sequenced, as was one leukemogenic revertant (Li et al., 1986) . One mutant contains three noncontiguous point mutations that cause nonconservative amino acid changes in the V-1 domain. It is not clear if all three changes are required for the loss in pathogenicity. A second mutant contains a point mutation leading to an early termination codon at amino acid residue 304. This mutation occurs immediately after the proposed xenotropic-ecotropic recombination site and therefore eliminates the V-2 domain including the membrane anchor.

The latter result suggests that the SFFV glycoprotein which can cause leukemia is also able to interact with viral receptors. These authors suggested that the xenotropic domain of the SFFV membrane glycoprotein binds to these receptors and causes erythroblastosis.

Nine acidic, six basic, and three hydrophobic amino acids surround this pocket and all are conserved in sequence among all NA serotypes.

For example, Asp-151 and -152 are invariant but residue 153 varies among subtypes. From the structure, the conserved amino acids face inward toward the pocket and the variable site is oriented outward toward the surface, a geometry in accord with the experimental data.

No aminoterminal signal sequence exists nor is there a hydrophobic membrane anchor domain near the carboxy terminus. These results have led to the suggestion that this G protein has its amino terminus, consisting of about 38 amino acids, in the cytoplasm. A hydrophobic sequence from residues 38 to 66 would serve as a signal sequence and membrane-spanning domain, and the balance of the 232 amino acids would constitute an ectodomain.

One of these, the E l of mouse hepatitis virus, resembles the G protein of respiratory syncytial virus, discussed above, in that there are a number of O-linked sugars on the protein (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . Coronavirus E l appears to be tightly membrane associated and its derived amino acid sequence shows a very hydrophobic region near the amino terminus. A postulated topological distribution of this protein in the membrane shows the amino terminus in the vesicle lumen (outside of the virion), a looping of sequences across the membrane several times, and a long hydrophilic carboxy-terminal region at the cytoplasmic face affixed to the polar groups of the bilayer (Rottier et al., 1986) . The other coronavirus membrane glycoprotein, noted E2 or S, is more conventional in its structure; there is an amino-terminal signal sequence and a carboxy-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchor domain. The protein is posttranslationally cleaved from a molecule of 180 kDa to two equivalent-sized subunits of 90 kDa. The carboxy-terminal subunit (90A) has a fusogenic activity that is enhanced after the proteolytic cleavage. Unlike the ortho-and paramyxoviruses, the fusogenic region appears not to be localized to the region of the polypeptide cleavage since the amino acids around this site are not hydrophobic (L. S. Sturman, personal communication). The most likely region for a fusion site is some 200 amino acids from the amino-terminal side of the cleavage site, where there is an extended sequence of hydrophobic amino acids. Another unusual feature of the coronavirus E2 is a clustering of cysteines in the cytoplasmic domain. This sequence contains a tricysteine and two dicysteines; a somewhat similar arrangement is found also in the cytoplasmic tails of the E2 glycoprotein of alphaviruses.",

One member of this family, the human rotavirus, produces a glycoprotein which participates in the assembly and secretion of virus into intracellular organelles. Later, the lipid suface is removed from the virion. Expression of the cDNA of this virus glycoprotein has been studied, and deletions of one of its two putative hydrophobic domains altered the location of this glycoprotein in the cell membrane (Poruchynsky et al., 1985) . The normal protein remains in the ER where the virus buds and transiently contains a lipid envelope. The protein carrying the deletions was transported from ER to Golgi and secreted. The authors also tested glycoproteins with deletions in the other hydrophobic domain and found no change in location. Thus, one of the hydrophobic domains of the glycoprotein is essential for specifying localization to the ER membrane.",

We have alluded to this property indirectly in the earlier discussions of the structure and posttranslational processing of these proteins, but there is more direct evidence for this role of the glycoprok i n in the virus-infected polarized epithelial cell. Rodriguez-Boulan and Sabatini (1978) first noted a specific distinction in the localization of virus budding between the apical and basal lateral membranes of this kind of cell. They found that influenza virus buds only from the apical surface whereas VSV is secreted from the basal lateral membrane. More recent experiments confirm this specific sorting of other enveloped viruses: paramyxoviruses are found at the apical surface and retroviruses and herpesviruses move to the basal lateral surface (Roth et al., 1983; Srinivas et al., 1986) . It is the glycoproteins of these viruses that determine which membrane of the cell is utilized, and there have been intensive efforts to determine what properties of these proteins specify sorting (reviewed by Simons and Fuller, 1986) . Sorting is not dependent on glycosylation pattern or sialic acid, and chimeric recombinant molecules have been constructed and expressed from cDNAs to determine which domains of the protein control sorting. A chimeric molecule composed of an influenza HA as the luminal portion and a VSV G as the transmembrane and cytoplasmic portion localizes according to that part determined by the luminal domain. That is, the chimeric protein moves to the apical surface (McQueen et al., 1986) . This result implicates the \"ectodomain\" as the determinant for sorting. However, a conflicting set of data were found with \"recombinant\" molecules containing the ectodomain of the Friend mink cell focus-inducing retrovirus but lacking the normal transmembranal and cytoplasmic domains. In this case the protein sorts to both the basal lateral and apical surfaces of the cell where it is secreted . Thus, the signal for sorting in the polarized cell remains unknown.",

Based on inspection of their sequence most of these proteins can be divided into the three major domains described in Fig. 1 . These domains have been defined with respect to their orientation in the lipid bilayer, but a complete description of a domain should also include its quaternary structure and function. This is possible, however, only for the HA and NA of influenza virus. X-Ray crystallographic studies provide us with a picture of what the ectodomain of these proteins looks like and permit a specific function to be correlated with a definitive structure. The ectodomains of viral glycoproteins are responsible for several important functions; receptor binding, fusogenic activity, and disease potential are among those discussed here. Although in some cases these functions can be associated with specific sequences of a protein, the crystallographic data will be essential to complete the picture.",

The effects of altering specific amino acid sequences, of swapping domains, and of adding a new domain to a protein serve to define the functions of a domain and to show that a domain can be independently associated with a specific function. The experiments described have been carried out by inserting the genes of particular viral glycoproteins, as cDNAs, into expression vectors and transcribing the cDNAs from the promoter provided by the expression vector. This approach established that localization and functions such as the fusogenic activity are properties of the viral glycoprotein per se and do not require other viral-coded components. The altered proteins have been analyzed for their ability to reach the appropriate location in the cell and to undergo the expected posttranslational modifications. Viral glycoproteins must also be able to participate in the assembly of infectious virions, and some of the changes, particularly those in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains that do not affect localization, may not permit critical interactions needed for the budding of particles. Now that we have accumulated some details about the requirements for transport, future work should be directed toward the requirements for virion assembly.",

An increasing number of viral glycoproteins that don't conform to this description are now undergoing scrutiny. They include proteins such as the E l of coronavirus that may span the membrane more than once, and those oriented with the amino terminus in the cytoplasmic domain. There are also viral glycoproteins with extensive 0-linked glycosylation, some of which have been noted here. Viral glycoproteins have served as important models for cellular membrane glycoproteins that localize to the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Not all viral glycoproteins move to the cell surface and some remain in internal membranes at sites of virion assembly. These distinctions among viral glycoproteins may reflect the diversity of cellular membrane glycoproteins; therefore, more detailed knowledge of different viral glycoproteins should provide valuable models for the spectrum of cellular glycoproteins. Further analyses of these viral glycoproteins will also surely contribute to our understanding of virion assembly and pathogenesis.",
