Inverse design concept uses the desired enclosed environment as the design objective and inversely determines the systems required to achieve the objective. This paper discusses a number of backward and forward methods for inverse design. Backward methods, such as the quasi-reversibility method, pseudo-reversibility method, and regularized inverse matrix method, can be used to identify contaminant sources in an enclosed environment. However, these methods cannot be used to inversely design a desired indoor environment. Forward methods, such as the CFD-based adjoint method, CFD-based genetic algorithm method, and proper orthogonal decomposition method, show the promise in the inverse design of airflow and heat transfer in an enclosed environment. The CFD-based adjoint method is accurate and can handle many design parameters without increasing computing costs, but the method may find a locally optimal design that could meet the design objective with constrains. The CFD-based genetic algorithm method, on the other hand, can provide the global optimal design that can meet the design objective without constraints, but the computing cost can increase dramatically with the number of design parameters. The proper orthogonal decomposition method is a reduced-order method that can significantly lower computing costs, but at the expense of reduced accuracy. This paper also discusses the possibility to reduce the computing costs of CFD-based design methods.",

This syndrome is frequently attributed to flaws in HVAC systems. Other possible causes related to indoor air quality are volatile organic compounds from building material outgassing, molds, and light industrial chemicals used in factories [6, 7] . During overseas flights on commercial airliners, up to half of the passengers typically experience health problems, with 5% of them requiring medical attention [8] . Respiratory diseases in particular can be transmitted in an airliner cabin [9] . For example, among the 120 passengers on a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing in 2003, 22 were infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [10] , and in 2009 the H1N1-A virus spread to 76 countries on six continents within a month and a half [11] .

By adjusting the HVAC system parameters iteratively on the basis of the evaluation results, the designer can achieve a desired enclosed environment. However, this trial-and-error process may involve a large number of iterations between the initial and final designs, highly depending on the designer's knowledge and experience.

Liu and Chen [47] established a CFD-based adjoint method for the optimal design of indoor airflow with thermo-fluid boundary conditions as the design variables and flow and/or temperature fields as the design objective. This study found that different initial inlet air conditions led to different optimal inlet air conditions, which implies the existence of multiple solutions. Later, Liu et al. [48] included the air supply location and size as design variables. In a two-dimensional non-isothermal ventilated cavity case [49] as shown in Fig. 4(a) , matching the simulation results with measured air velocity and temperature on the red dashed lines were used as the design objective. Fig. 4(b) and (c) show, respectively, the computed flow field with the initially guessed and the finally identified air supply location, size, and parameters. The design procedure required only 16 adjustments of the design variables, automatically performed during a single computation. The inlet location was inversely identified with reasonable accuracy for the targeted air velocity and temperature profiles at the two sections. The study also found that the computing costs did not vary with the number of design variables.",

GA is a gradientfree optimization method that simulates natural evolution in the search of optimal solutions. In order to perform evolution operations on design variables, GA must encode design variables into a string, which is called an individual. A collection of individuals constitutes a population. GA optimizes the solution with evolution (or iteration) of the population. A fitness value (the value of the objective function) quantifies the \"goodness\" of an individual. According to the number of objective functions, GA can be classified as a single-objective genetic algorithm (SOGA) or a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) [50] .",

Kato and Lee [80] applied a similar approach to optimizing a hybrid airconditioning system with natural ventilation. Xue et al. [81] implemented the inverse prediction and optimization of flow control conditions for confined spaces. Further, Zhai et al. [82] optimized flow control conditions for a confined space (Fig. 5(a) ) by satisfying multiple design indices, such as PMV, percentage dissatisfied with the draft (PD), and mean age of air. If the design objective is to have PMV \u00bc 0, PD < 15%, and mean age of air less than 125 s on the design domain represented by the circles in Fig. 5(a) , then all points on the curve of PMV \u00bc 0 shown in Fig. 5 (b) satisfy the first condition. The PMV \u00bc 0 and PD \u00bc 15% curves intersecting at point Q2 meet the second condition with a supply air velocity of 1.75 m/s and air temperature of 24.2 C. The curve of the mean age of air at 125 s intersecting with the curve of PMV \u00bc 0 at Q1 satisfies the third condition with a supply air velocity of 1.11 m/s and air temperature of 22.69 C. As a result, any design along the red line between Q1 and Q2 would meet the design objectives. Since the indoor environment design is a multivariable, multi-solution, multi-objective problem, the genetic algorithm can identify the global optima. Nevertheless, the CFDbased genetic algorithm method requires many CFD simulations during the population evolution, and the computational effort increases by orders of magnitude with an increase in the number of the design variables. An optimal design of an indoor environment using GA can take a week or more to reach the final solutions, depending on the case sophistication and accuracy requirements.",

Lam [86] used POD to construct the measured velocity and concentration distributions of a round jet. Early applications of the method for numerical fluid dynamics were for near-wall and jet-induced mixing flows [87e89]. Later, POD was applied to predict some basic fluid flows and heat transfer. For example, Cazemier et al. [90] used POD to construct a low-dimensional model for cavity-driven flows, in which 80 spatial modes were extracted from 700 snapshots. Couplet et al. [91] proposed a calibrated reduced-order POD-Galerkin model to predict the flows around a square cylinder and past a backward-facing step, respectively. Ding et al. [92] proposed the POD-based data interpolation strategy to predict the thermoflow fields for natural convection and forced convection flows.

Since a certain boundary condition would lead to one forward solution, an inverse design requires many trials with different boundary settings. An optimization technique like the adjoint method and genetic algorithm can be utilized to accelerate the search for a desired solution. The adjoint method is a gradientbased optimization, which may trap in a local optimum if no external interruption is imposed.

FFD first solves the advection term by a semi-Lagrangian approach [106] and then solve the source and diffusion term with an implicit scheme. Finally, FFD solves the pressure term and continuity equation together by using a pressure-projection method. By combining the solution of the three discretized equations, the method could get a final answer for the NS equation. The algorithm that does not require iteration so the computing speed is fast. It was initiated for computer game industry that seeks speed rather than accuracy. After further development by our team, FFD is also rather accurate now [107e114]. According to Zuo and Chen [104] , FFD can be 50 times faster than CFD and can predict the flow field with acceptable accuracy. Another option is to replace the CFD simulation with an artificial neural network. Zhou and Haghighat [115] combined a genetic algorithm and artificial neural network to optimize ventilation systems in office spaces. Boithias et al. [116] also proposed a genetic-algorithm-based method to optimize the architecture, training parameters, and inputs of an artificial neural network for predicting energy use and indoor discomfort during building control optimization. However, the use of an artificial neural network instead of CFD would increase the uncertainty and the risk of accumulative error [117] . To solve this problem, Zhang and You [118] used both an artificial neural network and CFD to obtain the design objectives of new individuals. This integrated method could ensure accuracy in calculating the design objectives and reduce computational costs by 65%.",

Giannakoglou et al. [119] developed the combined genetic method for the optimal design of aerodynamic shapes. The genetic algorithm was used for the initial design, and the adjoint method was applied for fine tuning, leading to faster convergence. The integrated CFD-based GA and adjoint method can be much faster than the pure CFD-based GA. In addition, the integrated method can find the global optima, thus overcoming the shortcomings of the pure CFD-based adjoint method. Xue et al. [120] combined the genetic algorithm with the adjoint method and revealed that this new integrated method is at great advantage when the number of variables for optimization is large.",

The backward methods can provide an approximate inverse solution efficiently. Hence, the inverse solution from the backward methods may be input into the forward methods as the initial guess of the final solution. Then the forward methods are employed to further improve the solution accuracy. The above strategy may shorten the time spent in circumscribing the rough ranges of design variables that satisfy the design targets. Such a scenario is viable at least for inverse identification of species sources. For example, Zhang et al. [121] backwardly determined the pollutant source release rates at all possible source locations first and then identified the correct source in a forward matching process.",

In principle, the methods presented in this paper can be extended to account for each individual's demanding objectives. The traditional general ventilation and boundary condition control may not fulfill the task. The designers may have to turn to personal environmental control. An inverse design that can take into account each individual's demanding objectives and its combination with a personal environmental control is a good topic for future study. The inverse design can demonstrate evidently its advantage in such a case.",
