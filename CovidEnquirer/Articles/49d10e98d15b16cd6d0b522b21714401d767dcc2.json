            "text": "To describe radiologic findings of adenovirus pneumonia and to understand clinico-radiological features associated with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with adenovirus pneumonia. Materials and Methods: This study included 19 patients diagnosed with adenovirus pneumonia at a tertiary referral center, in the period between March 2003 and April 2015. Clinical findings were reviewed, and two radiologists assessed imaging findings by consensus. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Student's t tests were used for comparing patients with and without subsequent development of ARDS. Results: Of 19 patients, nine were immunocompromised, and 10 were immunocompetent. Twelve patients (63%) progressed to ARDS, six of whom (32%) eventually died from the disease. The average time for progression to ARDS from symptom onset was 9.6 days. Initial chest radiographic findings were normal (n = 2), focal opacity (n = 9), or multifocal or diffuse opacity (n = 8). Computed tomography (CT) findings included bilateral (n = 17) or unilateral (n = 2) ground-glass opacity with consolidation (n = 14) or pleural effusion (n = 11). Patients having subsequent ARDS had a higher probability of pleural effusion and a higher total CT extent compared with the non-ARDS group (p = 0.010 and 0.007, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in clinical variables such as patient age and premorbid condition. Conclusion: Adenovirus pneumonia demonstrates high rates of ARDS and mortality, regardless of patient age and premorbid conditions, in the tertiary care setting. Large disease extent and presence of pleural effusion on CT are factors suggestive of progression to ARDS.",

Specimens from patients who underwent bronchoscopy with the collection of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or lung biopsy, as well as those who underwent surgical biopsy, were stained and cultured for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. In addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for BAL specimens and nasal or throat swabs were performed to detect viral organisms. Patients in whom other infectious organisms were identified in the sputum, blood, urine, nasal and throat swabs, BAL fluid, or lung specimen within four weeks of adenovirus identification were regarded to have a concurrent infection and were excluded from this study. Finally, 19 patients confirmed to have only adenovirus pneumonia were included in this study; these patients included the five patients whose imaging features were published in our previous study (10) .",

GGO was defined as an area of hazy increased lung opacity, within which margins of pulmonary vessels were indistinct. Consolidation was defined as a homogeneous increase in pulmonary parenchymal opacity that obscured the margins of vessels and airway walls (18) . The presence of interlobular septal thickening or pleural effusion was also recorded, and the laterality (unilateral vs. bilateral) of the lesions was evaluated. Septal thickening was defined as abnormal widening of an interlobular septum or septa (18) . In terms of anatomic location, the distribution of parenchymal abnormalities was classified as central, peripheral, or mixed in the axial plane and upper, lower, or random in the longitudinal plane. The outer third of the lung was defined as peripheral, and the inner twothirds of the lung were defined as central. The lesions were regarded as distributed in the upper lung zone when they were located above the hilum, in the lower lung zone when they were located below the hilum, or random when the distribution could not be determined. For the acquisition of CT scores, the lung was also divided into upper (above the carina), middle (below the carina and up to the inferior pulmonary vein), and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein) zones. The involvement of pneumonia within each lung zone was evaluated by scoring each zone from 0 (normal) to 4, with 4 corresponding to nearly total involvement of the lung parenchyma. Total CT scores ranged from 0 to 24 when combined for all six zones (17, 19) .",

Close imaging follow- One can argue that the rate of respiratory failure in adenovirus pneumonia might have been overestimated in our study, considering the way that adenovirus pneumonia was confirmed. The effort for confirmatory diagnosis was usually made when the results of laboratory evaluations, including the staining and culture of blood, urine, and sputum, were negative, and the response to empirical antibiotic therapy was unsatisfactory. Thus, the diagnosis might have been delayed, missing the important opportunity for timely treatment. In addition, our institution is a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul; thus, the rates of ARDS and mortality could be further exaggerated. We admit that the rates of ARDS and mortality of adenovirus pneumonia in our study might not be applicable to those of adenovirus pneumonia in the general community.

It is known that adenovirus causes cytolysis, which accounts for tissue damage, and damaged pulmonary capillaries can contribute to respiratory failure (24) . Another possible explanation is the unregulated complement activation, producing C5a and resulting in activation of phagocytic cells, generation of oxidants, release of histones, and, eventually, a cytokine storm (25, 26) . Many previous cases of respiratory failure resulting from influenza A viruses H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9, In terms of the radiological findings of adenovirus pneumonia, the CT features were so diverse that it was difficult to define specific findings for adenovirus pneumonia. Although the most common CT feature was bilateral ground-glass opacities, the findings were variable, from unilateral lobar consolidation to clustered micronodules. With regard to the initial chest radiographic findings, two patients (11%) were normal, while focal opacity was noted in nine patients (47%). Despite the well-known imaging features of viral pneumonia, which causes diffuse and bilateral interstitial involvement (28) , two patients in our study presented with unilateral consolidation and GGO with or without pleural effusion. Features of focal opacity on chest radiograph and unilateral dense consolidation on CT were likely to be interpreted as community-acquired pneumonia. In fact, there have been several reports describing adenovirus pneumonias that have presented with unilateral lobar infiltrates (6, 8, 20) . Thus, we should not discard the possibility of adenoviral pneumonia in patients suspected of having an acute lower respiratory tract infection with unilateral airspace lesion, especially when response to antibiotics was ineffective, and sputum Gram stain and culture were negative for bacterial infection. Every effort should be made to achieve a confirmative diagnosis and timely treatment in such cases.",

Further work needs to be performed investigating the virulent strains of adenovirus, particularly with regard to radiologic appearance, disease extent, and severity. Third, the time to CT acquisition from symptom onset was heterogeneous, ranging from two to 15 days. CT scans from the ARDS group might have progressed from an initially mild disease to showing a relatively large extent of involvement. Fourth, we simplified the chest radiographic abnormality as focal, multifocal, and diffuse opacity without assessing other findings such as interstitial opacities. However, we were more focused on the disease extent and sequential radiographic changes rather than detailed radiographic findings. Fifth, our study only included patients confirmed to have adenovirus pneumonia and did not include a comparison group. Sixth, the diagnosis of adenovirus pneumonia was made using various methods. Lastly, the number of cases in the present study is small, and a large-scale prospective study is needed. In addition, comparison of clinico-radiological features between immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients with adenovirus pneumonia would also have clinical implications toward understanding the clinical course of the disease.",

However, we should remember that adenovirus pneumonia can also present as focal opacity with unilateral airspace lesions. Patients with adenovirus pneumonia demonstrate subsequent rapid deterioration to ARDS regardless of age and premorbid conditions; thus, aggressive treatment and careful follow-up are mandatory. In particular, patients who have progressed to ARDS are prone to show a large disease extent and high probability of pleural effusion on CT, supporting the importance of intensive imaging follow-up in patients suffering from adenovirus pneumonia.",
