A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Gastro-intestinal (GI) parasites of dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) and fat-tailed sheep (dhumba), and the prevalence of hemoparasites in camel from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Materials and Methods: A total of 87 fecal samples (32 dhumba and 55 camel) and 55 camel blood samples were collected during September-October 2015. Fecal samples were examined by direct smear, sedimentation method, flotation technique, and McMaster technique for GI parasite. Giemsa stained blood smears were examined under microscope for hemoparasite detection. Results: 62% camel (n = 34; 95% confidence interval (CI): 47.7-74.6) were infected with at least one genus of parasite. 15% camel were harboring more than one genus of parasite. The prevalence of GI parasite and hemoparasite in camel were recorded as Trichuris spp. (n = 16; 29%; 95% CI: 17.6-42.9), Balantidium coli (n = 12; 22%; 95% CI: 11.8-35.0), Trichostrongylus spp. (n = 7; 13%; 95% CI: 5.3-24.5), Strongyloides spp. (n = 5; 9%; 95% CI: 3.0-20.0), Anaplasma spp. (n = 5; 9%; 95% CI: 3.02-20.0), Paragonimus spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05-9.7), Schistosoma spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05-9.7), Hymenolepis spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05-9.7), Moniezia spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05-9.7), and Babesia spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05-9.7). Mean EPG feces of camel was 291.76 \u00b1 42.03 with a range of 0-1,400. Total 59.4% dhumba (n = 19; 95% CI: 41-76) were positive for GI parasite, including Trichostrongylus spp. (n = 10; 31.3%; 95% CI: 16.1-50), Strongyloides spp. (n = 9; 28%; 95% CI: 13.8-46.8), B. coli (n = 5; 15.6%; 95% CI: 5.3-32.8), and Trichuris spp. (n = 4; 12.5%; 95% CI: 3.5-28.9). Conclusions: High percentage of parasitic infestation in camel and dhumba in the present study refers to the necessity of use of anthelmintic for health and production improvement and to prevent zoonotic parasite transmission to animal handler and workers.",

They are mostly reared in desert areas of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia [1] . 94% of the world's camel populations are found in the Horn region of Africa. Dhumba comprises 25% of the world's sheep population; some well-known dhumba breeds are Afrikaner, Damara, Persian Black Head, Tswana, Pedi, Sabi, Karakul, Awassi, Balkhi, etc [2] . Camel and dhumba are not usual animals for Bangladesh. But these species are of high economic value during religious festival in our country. Only one established camel farm is found in Bangladesh, which excels in camel farming as well as dhumba farming [3] . The farm was established with six imported camel from India in 2006. Since then, the farmer was able to do successful breeding of camel and the number of animal is increasing.",

Public health is in danger because of zoonotic parasites. Fat-tailed sheep and camel are more resistant to disease than other domesticated livestock. But different types of parasites have been identified in dromedaries and sheep from various countries [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The only study on camel of Bangladesh reported gastro-intestinal (GI) parasite prevalence as 27.9%, 26.3%, and 26.2% in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively; zoonotic parasite Fasciola hepatica was detected in that study [9] .

Slides were initially examined under compound light microscope in wet mounts under low magnification (10\u00d7) to trace, followed by high magnification (100\u00d7) for identification of eggs or parasites [10, 11] . Eggs of particular genera and adult parasites were identified based on morphological characters (shape and shell structure) and size [10] .

B. coli was found in both one-humped and two-humped camels of Iran and in young camel of Bahrain [5, 31] . The study also identified Anaplasma spp. (9.1%) and Babesia spp. (1.8%) in camel. Prevalence of Anaplasma spp. infection is nearly similar (7.2%) with the findings from China on Bactrian camels [32] and lower than a study conducted in one-humped camel of Tunisia (17.7%) [33] . Babesia spp. was found in both one-humped and two-humped camel of Iran [5] and in one-humped camel of Egypt with a high prevalence (11.8%) than the present study [34] . Different species of Trichuris, Trichostrongylus, Schistosoma, Hymenolepis, Balantidium, and Anaplasma infect human with a various degree of pathogenicity. Common route of infection for most of them is contaminated feed or water. Detection of so many zoonotic parasites in camel and dhumba in the study implies unhygienic condition of farm and market, contaminated water supply to the animals. These parasites can easily be transmitted to human handlers as they have frequent contact with these species. Moreover, the sampled farm followed cut-andcarry system of feeding. Same was applied for the market. So these could be an important source of the parasite in the sampled animals if the grasses were not supplied after proper washing.",

Higher prevalence of GI parasites was found in female fat-tailed sheep (76%) and camel (73.1%) than that of male in the study. A previous study from Indore on slaughterhouse sheep reported higher prevalence in female [35] . Similarly, female camel was reported to be more infected than male in the study conducted by [21] , although the prevalence was much higher than our study. The infection in female could be attributed to genetic predisposition and differential susceptibility due to hormonal control. During pregnancy and peri-parturient periods, female animals have a stressed and immune-suppressed condition that makes them susceptible to disease although they share similar husbandry practice with male [36] . Moreover, the discrepancy in prevalence may be influenced by the smaller sample size of the present study.",

This information will convey an important message to farmers and practitioners for parasite control strategies, especially the zoonotic ones. Regular use of anthelmintic and hygienic management should be implemented in farms in order to control the parasites and to prevent the transmission of zoonotic parasites from animal to farm personnel. Future studies should be implemented to identify the genus of the parasites for better control strategies.",
