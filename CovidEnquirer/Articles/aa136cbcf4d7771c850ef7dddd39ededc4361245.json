The discussion of global health challenges includes both the transfer of health risks, with an emphasis on infectious diseases, and the international dissemination of health opportunities, including the transfer of knowledge and technology. Consistent with the UN report on global security, we argue that the health-related challenges and opportunities of an increasingly interdependent world demand new forms of international cooperation. The authors suggest the promotion of 3 elements that, in their essence, contain the idea of collaboration: exchange, evidence, and empathy.",

            "text": "In sum, infectious diseases are not the exclusive domain of a primitive stage in the health transition, but rather a shifting component of every epidemiologic pattern. This conclusion also serves to counter the second misconception that infectious diseases are mostly a problem of underdeveloped countries. As we have seen, even in societies where noncommunicable diseases dominate the epidemiologic pictures, infection is a common companion of such diseases. Furthermore, the extent of integration in our world means that no country can be isolated from risks that emerge elsewhere. 6 In fact, this is not a new phenomenon. The first documented case of a transnational epidemic was the Athenian plague of 430 BC. 7 Having probably originated in Ethiopia, it spread to Libya and Egypt and finally reached the heart of ancient Greece in grain boats. 8 According to Thucydides, this calamity was responsible for the defeat of Athens in the war against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League, which marked the decline of its golden age. 9 The Black Death of 1347, which killed at least one-third of the European population, originated in Central Asia and spread through military conflicts and international trade. It was during this epidemic that Venetians invented quarantine, isolating arriving ships for 40 days. 10 The conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires in the sixteenth century was an early example of involuntary microbiological warfare through the introduction of smallpox and measles into previously unexposed populations. The colonization of the Caribbean and Brazil almost led to the extermination of the indigenous populations, a situation that forced the importation of slaves from West Africa. This trade, in turn, brought malaria and yellow fever to the New World, creating additional disasters. 11 In this microbial exchange, Columbus probably took one dire disease from the Americas to Europe: great pox (syphilis). 12 Another example in the uninterrupted history of the transnational transfer of infection is the 1829 cholera pandemic, which started in Asia, broke into Egypt and North Africa, entered Russia, and crossed Europe. Three years later it reached the eastern coast of the United States. 13 In the twentieth century, the influenza pandemic of 1918, erroneously known as Spanish flu, accounted for an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide, 5 times more casualties than those produced in combat during World War I. 14 As we can see, infectious diseases have an old record of cosmopolitan presence. What is new, however, is the scale of what has been called microbial traffic. The number of potentially infectious contacts has exploded as trade and travel bring persons and products closer than ever before. Today the longest intercontinental flight is briefer than the incubation period of any known human infectious disease, posing unprecedented challenges to disease surveillance and making classical quarantine measures obsolete. Even the existing therapeutic arsenal has lost a substantial part of its effectiveness in this context of growing health interdependence. 15 Tuberculosis (TB) provides a dramatic example. In 2003, close to 9 million persons worldwide became infected with TB and more than 2 million died of it. Several reasons explain this unexpected comeback; one is the fragility of the immune suppressed. As we know, TB is often the first sign that a person harbors HIV. Other reasons include overcrowding, poor nutrition, and inadequate health care, which are common among the socially marginalized. Migrants are a particularly vulnerable population. Not surprisingly, morbidity and mortality rates for HIV and TB are several times higher among migrants and in the northern border states of Mexico than in this country as a whole. Likewise, more than 50% of TB cases in the United States are reported in the 4 states bordering Mexico.",

Two thousand years after the first recorded treatment against malaria, we are still facing the challenge of devising an effective cure.

In fact, we now know that most of the health gains achieved during the twentieth century can be attributed to the advancement of knowledge 23 through 3 main mechanisms. First, knowledge gets translated into new and better technologies, such as vaccines and drugs. This method is the best-understood mechanism through which it improves health. But knowledge is also internalized by individuals who use it to structure their everyday behavior in key domains, such as personal hygiene, feeding habits, sexuality, and child-rearing practices. Finally, knowledge becomes translated into evidence that provides a scientific foundation both for health care and for the formulation of public policies. 24 Recent developments in our country illustrate this last point. Thanks to the cooperation among several academic and international organizations, the analytical armamentarium for health policy has been greatly enriched during the past few years to include such robust tools as the measurement of burden of disease, costeffectiveness analysis, national health accounts, and standardized surveys. The rigorous application of these knowledge-related global public goods, coupled with excellent country-specific data, generated the evidence base to catalyze a major legislative reform in 2003 that will allow Mexico to offer publicly funded health insurance to the entire population. 25 This development is a clear example of how globalization can turn knowledge into an international public good that can then be brought to the domestic policy agenda to address a local problem. Such application, in turn, feeds back into the global pool of experience, thus, generating a process of shared learning among countries. Everyone stands to benefit if we have the wisdom to move beyond the false dilemmas between research and action and between the global and the national levels.",

Thanks to economic research, we know that health is a contributing factor, at both the individual and population levels, for enhancing learning, increasing productivity, reducing inequity, promoting economic well-being and growth, preventing impoverishment, and reducing poverty, all of which strengthen national and global security. 28, 29 Equitable access to high-quality services has also become central to the global movement for human rights. In this way, health can contribute to humanizing globalization because it involves those domains that unite all persons.
