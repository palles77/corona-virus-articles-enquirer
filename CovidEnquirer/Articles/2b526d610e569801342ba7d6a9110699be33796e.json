            "text": "A chemical sensor is a device that transforms, for example, a concentration of a chemical into a useful analytical signal (adapted from lUPAC, International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry definition). Walsh (2003) indicates that a biosensor may be considered as a chemical sensor with three components: (a) a receptor, a transducer, and a separator. The receptor or biological element (for example, enzymes, antigens, antibodies, tissues, whole cells, bacteria, etc.) converts the biochemical binding event to a measurable component. The transducer converts this measurable component to generally a measurable electrical or optical signal. The transducer could, for example, be an acoustical device, a calorimetric device, an optical device, or an electrochemical device. The separator (for example, a membrane) separates the transducer from the bioreceptor. Walsh (2003) has provided some examples of biosensors that have been commercialized, and include: glucose sensors to help monitor sugar levels in diabetics, lactate biosensors, amperometric sensors for gases, and ion-selective electrode (ISE) for blood gases and electrolytes. Figure 1 .1 shows the components of a biosensor (Biowise, 2001) . Simply speaking, there is a biological component and an electronic device. The biological receptor (component) reacts with the analyte of interest (binding and/or dissociation), and produces a biochemical change. This biochemical change is transduced or converted to a measurable signal. The amplifier increases the intensity of the signal enabling easier measurement. Bio wise (2001) indicates that these components are housed in a single unit that may either be placed at a strategic location or made more portable.",

            "text": "With the advent of nanotechnology, miniaturization, and improved fabrication techniques, there is more and more emphasis on hand-held devices, especially for the detection of biological hazards and biowarfare agents. According to Check (2004) , the United States Department of Homeland Security has a $41.5 million program to develop and evaluate hand-held kits to detect harmful biologicals in a possible terrorist attack situation. These are to be used by emergency workers and by first responders. However, these hand-held detection devices still have problems during use. One way around this is to use these hand-held detectors to rule out a lot of other things, and to use them along with other techniques. Some evaluators of these hand-held detectors indicated that they were too limited in their use. Hopefully, with more analysis and research these hand-held detection devices will become an integral part of the arsenal used by emergency workers and by first responders. Turner et al. (1987) define a biosensor as a 'compact analytical device that incorporates a biological element or a biologically-derived element that is either integrated with or intimately associated with a physicochemical transducer'. These authors further indicate that the signals from the biosensor may be either discrete or continuous. They indicate that the major demand for biosensors is in glucose monitoring for diabetics which comprises 85-90% of the total market for biosensors. This is facilitated by the biosensors providing a convenient, compact, and hygienic method of glucose measurement (Turner, 1996) . The three major players involved in glucose monitoring are Abbott, Boehringer Mannheim, and Bayer.",

The activity of the enzyme is noted by incubating the enzymes with model substrates and testing by mass spectrometry for the products. Potential enzyme inhibitors are passed over the sensor chip containing the enzyme. The binding kinetics (if any) is noted by SPR. Then, model substrates are passed over the sensor chip again, and mass spectrometric analysis determines if the enzyme activity has been inhibited by the compounds been tested for possible therapeutic usage. Enzyme inhibitors apparently exhibit an increasing potential for use as therapeutic agents, thus screening procedures, such as those proposed by Borch and Roepstorff (2004) are bound to gain increasing importance in the future. Skretas and Wood (2004) have recently indicated the need for a variety of drugscreening assays to help test different compounds and protein targets for potential drugs. This needs to be done in a high throughput fashion. These authors have engineered hormone sensitive bacteria for efficient drug screening. Their method is based on ligand binding of in vivo sensors. Their in vivo sensor was a hormone, and they used it to analyze ligand binding in Escherichia Coli.

These authors indicate that this is an optical technique that involves measuring the change of a polarization state of an elliptically polarized beam reflected from thin films (Azzam and Bashara, 1997). Bae et al. (2004) point out that the advantage of using the IE for biosensor applications is that it permits label-free detection, it is simple to operate, and it is highly sensitive. Durisin et al. (1997) have indicated that Y. enterocolitica is a human pathogenic species and causes yersiniosis. This disease is characterized by fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Using their developed immunosensor Bae et al. (2004) were able to detect Y. enterocolitica concentrations in the range of 10^-10^ cfu/ml. Joshi et al. (2004) have recently used a carbon nanotube based biosensor to detect a VX analog and its degradation products. These authors indicate that sarin, soman, and VX are highly toxic nerve agents. They indicate that their degradation products are more stable than the original compounds. Thus, their detection in the atmosphere can be used to (a) prove the existence of the use of these toxic nerve agents, and (b) assist in monitoring the destruction of these harmful compounds. Using electrochemical detection and the use of carbon nanotubes (CNT) these authors were able to (a) detect VX degradation products and (b) with a modification, the detection of the VX analog, Demton-S. May et al. (2004a,b) have very recently developed a whole-cell based biosensor to detect histamine as a model toxin. These authors indicate that histamine resides in seafood, and in patients with severe allergic reactions (Niwa et al, 2000) . May et al. (2004a,b) emphasize that their biosensor could find applications in homeland security, food and medical areas, and in environmental monitoring. A monolayer of HUVECs was attached to a CTA membrane of an ISE. These authors indicate that histamine alters the permeability of HUVECs. In the absence of toxic agents, and in the presence of potassium (K\"^) ions, the monolayer blocks the interface, yielding no response from the ISE. In the presence of toxins, the permeability of the cells is affected, K\"^ reaches the ISE, which gives rise to a change in the potential of the ISE.",

The food poisoning is due to pathogens such as Salmonella and E. coli. Out of these 75 million people about 1-1.5% are hospitalized (-325,000), and about 0.05-0.1% (-5000) of these cases are fatal. This author indicates that Rand, Letcher, and Brown at the University of Rhode Island have developed a fiber optic probe along with immobilized Salmonella 1. Introduction antibodies that bind to the pathogen (Salmonella) cell. The Salmonella antibodies are labeled with a fluorescent dye. Rand indicates that the binding of the pathogen cells to the antibodies takes about an hour (~ 60 min), and the processing of the concentration signal occurs in about 1 ^ min. The aim was to extend the application of their biosensor to the detection of pathogens in seafood and a (hand-held) scanning system for supermarket checkout. Taylor et al. (2004) have recently used the SPR biosensor to detect food pathogens and toxins in complex media. They used a multichannel SPR biosensor for the quantitative and simultaneous detection of food pathogens and toxins. For example, using their biosensor these authors were able to detect E. coli at levels as low as 104 cfu/ml. They emphasize that this level is two orders of magnitude lower than that obtained and reported by standard SPR or ELISA methods. Pal et al. (2004) have very recently developed a membrane-based immunofiltration assay that is able to detect T2 toxin in wheat and poultry feed. The limits of detection are 12.5 and 25 |xg/kg, respectively. This is a competitive analysis method wherein the labeled analyte is T-2 toxin-horseradish peroxidase (T-2 toxin-HRP) and the substrate is 4-chloro-l-naphthol (4CN). These authors indicate that the ELISA method is an order of magnitude more sensitive than their membrane-based methods. They state that soil-fungi contaminate food grains in temperate climates. These fungi produce mycotoxins, such as the T2 toxin which causes alimentary toxicity. ELISA is an appropriate way to do this, but it is time consuming and sophisticated equipment is required. Furthermore, laborious and elaborate procedures are required to remove interfering substances from the matrix of the sample prior to detection of the T2 toxin (Sukhadin, 2003; Langseth and Rundberget, 1998; Pascale et al, 2003) .",

A differential stress results when there is adsorption of molecules on one side of the microcantilever. This leads to bending of the microcantilever. Bottomley et al. (2004) indicate that this cantilever bending can be measured with angstrom resolution using optical resolution, capacitance and piezoelectric measurements. These authors analyzed the influence of nano-and mesoscale particles on the performance of microcantilever sensors. They noted that the direct injection of, for example, biological fluids without the removal of particles (> 0.7 (xm) may cause problems when cantilevers are used. These authors suggest that the presence of particles in the fluid produces scattering of the laser beam used to measure the cantilever deflection. This may significantly influence the results, thus particle sizes greater than 0.7 iJim should be removed from fluids prior to injection to a cantilever.",

For example, cancer markers, or markers for the onset of ischemic heart disease. As expected, the earlier one is able to detect these types of diseases, the better is the quality of life once treatment starts, and perhaps, there is an improvement in the prognosis of the disease. Testing for the onset of autoimmune diseases, such as arthritis, systemic lupus erythomaosus (SLE), etc. is bound to gain Kelzai, 2004) Year Estimated market $, billions importance in the future. Incidentally, diabetes is also an autoimmune disease. For SLE, one needs to estimate levels of different analytes (such as creatinine, autoantibodies, etc.) to be able to predict the onset of a 'flare', and thus help better control the disease. This was quite evident at the 11th International Congress of Immunology held in July/August 2001 in Stockholm, Sweden, where quite a few companies displayed the state-of-the-art biosensors for the early detection of quite a few autoimmune diseases. However, this type of a market is speciality type of a market, and the demand for these types of biosensors will be nowhere near that of diabetes testing. Finally, hopefully, as technologies develop the cost of manufacturing these integrated devices will decrease, and their reliability will improve to the extent to make biosensors a competitive product with regard to other existing methods of detection. As expected, the worldwide estimates for the biosensor market differs when projected by different authors and sources. It is perhaps useful to provide another estimate, from a very reliable source (www.cranfieId.ac.uk/biomark.htm) even though the estimate may be rather dated (for the year 1996). The estimate was for one billion British pounds. Using an exchange rate of one British pound equal to 1.8269 US $ (Exchange checked on October 21, 2004) . This works out to $1.82 billion. Using a 10.4% growth rate in the worldwide biosensor market. Table 1 .1b shows the estimated worldwide market going back a few years (this is unusual), and then projecting ahead till the year 2010.",

Prions are 'misfolded' proteins, that lead to intractable diseases, such as Alzheimers, etc. As expected, these prions have generated, and will presumably continue to generate a considerable amount of interest in the research community. In Chapter 6 we analyze the binding and dissociation kinetics of analytes related to human health on biosensor surfaces. Initially, the medical area has been the major driving force in the development of biosensors. Testing for sugar levels (for the onset or presence of diabetes, and in the control of this aliment) has been a predominant market for biosensors. However, presently, more and more sensors are becoming available in the market for determining the levels of analytes, other than sugar levels. Also, in some intractable, persistent, and perhaps difficult to diagnose diseases, one needs to analyze for more than one particular analyte, and quite frequently. For example, systemic lupus erythomatosus (SLE), where one needs to determine levels of creatinine, autoantibodies, etc. Once these analyte levels are out of their 'normal range', then one can quickly take corrective action, for example, the 'flare' in SLE diagnosed individuals.",
