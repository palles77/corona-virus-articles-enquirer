We performed a retrospective evaluation of pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed hMPV infections and underlying hematologic malignancy, solid tumors, solid organ transplant, rheumatologic disease, and/or receipt of chronic immunosuppressants. Data were analyzed using t tests and Fisher's exact tests. Results. Overall, 55 patients (median age: 5 years; range: 5 months-19 years) with hMPV infection documented between 2006 and 2010 were identified, including 24 (44%) with hematologic malignancy, 9 (16%) undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, 9 (16%) with solid tumors, and 8 (15%) with solid organ transplants. Three (5%) presented with fever alone, 35 (64%) presented with upper respiratory tract infections, and 16 (29%) presented with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Twelve (23%) patients required intensive care unit admission and/or supplemental oxygen 28% FiO 2 . Those with severe disease were more likely to be neutropenic (P = .02), but otherwise did not differ by age (P = .27), hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient status (P = .19), or presence of lymphopenia (P = .09). Nine (16%) patients received treatment with ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin, or both. Three children (5%) died of hMPV pneumonia. Conclusions. Immunocompromised pediatric patients with hMPV infection have high rates of LRTI and mortality. The benefits of treatment with ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin in this patient population require further evaluation.",

            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a paramyxovirus first identified in 2001 as a pathogen associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children [1] . Seroprevalence studies show that almost all children acquire infection by 5 years of age, and that frequent reinfections occur through life [2, 3] . The prevalence of hMPV infection among hospitalized children with acute respiratory infection or fever is similar to that of other respiratory viruses. Clinical disease most closely resembles that associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), a related paramyxovirus [4] . A prospective cohort study of hMPV revealed a 9.4% seroprevalence in children hospitalized with respiratory tract infections, with 63% of patients requiring supplemental oxygen and 3% requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission [5] . Lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTI) caused by hMPV includes bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup. hMPV is also associated with acute otitis media, as well as more rarely conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and rash [6, 7] . In adults with hematologic malignancy, hMPV is associated with high rates of progression from upper to lower respiratory tract disease and substantial mortality [8, 9] .",

Of 368 total patients with positive hMPV laboratory results, we performed retrospective chart review to identify a subset of 55 patients with immunocompromised conditions.

Using electronic chart review, we abstracted sociodemographic variables, symptoms, laboratory and radiologic values, clinical course, and treatment outcomes for these patients.",

The presentation of hMPV in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients was shown to be similar to patients with other immunocompromising conditions, with fever and cough as the most common symptoms. We also show that the majority of immunocompromised patients diagnosed with hMPV are subsequently admitted to the hospital for further evaluation, but that only 2% of those initially presenting with URTI symptoms go on to develop LRTI. However, there were no clear differences in the presentation of patients with URTI or LRTI in terms of age, symptoms (fever or cough), laboratory abnormalities, or underlying condition that would clearly identify risk factors for LRTI disease and guide decisionmaking. Interestingly, 2 of the 3 patient deaths were in patients with hMPV pneumonia diagnosed prior to HSCT. Both of these patients, however, had underlying diseases (aplastic anemia and SCID), which made it extremely unlikely that they would be able to clear their viral infection without reconstitution of their immune system through HSCT. These patients both underwent HSCT, and subsequently died of hMPV pneumonia despite use of ribavirin and IVIG and supportive care including mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. These 2 patients continued to have detectable virus within days of death.",

Pretransplant screening for RSV and delay of transplant in adults is effective in reducing rates of pneumonia [20] . Our policy in pediatric patients is to delay transplant if patients have evidence of infection with RSV, influenza, adenovirus, or hMPV, even if patients are asymptomatic. Transplantation is not generally delayed for asymptomatic shedding of rhinovirus, bocavirus, or coronavirus. This study further enforces the risks associated with transplantation during documented hMPV viral shedding or disease. Because infection may result in such serious disease, potential modalities to treat or at least stabilize patients while white blood cells and/or immune function can return are considered and utilized in these patients. Treatment with IVIG and ribavirin is currently being utilized at our institution for severely immunocompromised individuals [21, 22] . Among the patients who received treatment, we demonstrated a 22% mortality rate as compared to a 2% mortality rate in untreated individuals. This, however, is almost certainly a reflection of clinical decision-making to initiate treatment in individuals with more severe disease.",

We did not screen asymptomatic children and may not have captured complete data on children who were evaluated solely as outpatients at other private clinics or hospitalized in other institutions. As the regional pediatric referral center, most immunocompromised patients are seen and followed at our institution but because of our large geographic referral area, it is possible that some children were seen elsewhere. Therefore, our study could be biased towards detection of more severe hMPV disease. Also, it is possible that a subset of earlier hMPV-positive cases were missed through use of DFA as compared to PCR, a more sensitive detection technique [12] . Furthermore, we were unable to capture all data at the time of clinical presentation, or to obtain full information regarding the clinical decisionmaking for the administration of ribavirin and/or IVIG. Therefore, the comparison of outcomes in patients who did and did not receive treatment is problematic, and the potential benefits of therapy are not readily evaluable. Unlike a previous hMPV study conducted in adult HSCT recipient patients in Italy [23] , we did not assess hMPV shedding in asymptomatic patients and unfortunately cannot comment on rates of symptomatic versus asymptomatic shedding of hMPV in our patients. Finally, we were limited in our ability to classify disease severity based on hypoxemia, as some patients did not have oxygen saturations charted. We suspect that a higher proportion of our patients would be classified as having severe disease using criteria such as that used by Papenburg et al [5] . Although only 8 (15%) of our patients were identified as having acquired their hMPV infection nosocomially, the vast majority of the patients were seen frequently on an outpatient basis in clinic for blood draws, interventions, and chemotherapy, making it difficult to differentiate true community-acquired disease from that acquired in the hospital setting.",
