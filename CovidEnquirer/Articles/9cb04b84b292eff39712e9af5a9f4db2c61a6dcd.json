In the case of schizophrenia and mood disorders, the major psychiatric disorders, there is much evidence, not without contradictions, of a possible association between schizophrenia and celiac disease. The association between mood disorders and gluten-related disorders, especially celiac disease, has only been studied for depression, often coupled with anxiety, and very recently for bipolar disorder. Since non-celiac gluten sensitivity is now known to be different from celiac disease, many studies have shown that gluten sensitivity is also associated with major psychiatric disorders. Here we review the literature on the association between schizophrenia/mood disorders and celiac disease/ gluten sensitivity, pointing out the differences between these associations.",

            "text": "An increased rate of autoimmune diseases has been demonstrated in individuals with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ) [1, 2] and mood disorders (MD) [3, 4] . Individuals diagnosed as having an autoimmune disease are also likely to be at increased risk of psychiatric disorders. Thus, the involvement of autoimmune mechanisms is increasingly held responsible for the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Among autoimmune diseases, celiac disease (CD) has been described for years in association with SCZ [5] [6] [7] , as celiac patients are felt to be at increased risk of schizophrenia. However, it has recently been discovered that the immune response to gluten in schizophrenic patients diverges from that in CD [8, 9] . As far as mood disorders are concerned, since they have not been systematically studied as disorders, their association with CD is neither conclusive nor systematic and is limited to depression, often coupled with anxiety. Moreover, when a positive statistical association between depression and celiac disease has been found, the percentage frequencies varied from 6 to 57 % [10] . There is still a lack of consensus about the nature of this association, with two opposing schools of thought: the first posits that specific mechanisms are implied in a common pathogenesis, while the second considers depression not specifically linked to CD but rather a chance event [11] . Regarding bipolar disorder (BD), to date only a few studies have investigated its association with CD. The first report showed increased risk of developing depression but not bipolar disorder in patients diagnosed with CD, while prior depression and BD were positively associated with subsequent onset of CD [12] . In a recent study, celiac disease was not demonstrated to determine a statistically significant risk of bipolar disorder [4] . However, like for schizophrenia, recent research showed that immunological reactivity to gluten, different from CD, can also be present in bipolar disorder [13] [14] [15] . This reactivity towards gluten is known as non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or more simply gluten sensitivity (GS), recently found to be different from CD [16] .",

Gluten sensitivity is also characterized by a lack of intestinal damage, negative CD serology (anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and anti-endomysial antibodies) and a possible presence of biomarkers of native gluten immune reaction (anti-gliadin antibodies) [17] . Moreover, while CD is strongly associated with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes, known as HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, these genes are present in only about 50 % of patients with GS [18] . A recent study also demonstrated that gut permeability does not occur in GS, unlike in CD [19] . Thus, GS only seems to be characterized by activation of innate immune response, rather than adaptive response, which is responsible for detectable mucosal damage in CD. Finally, analysis of intestinal mucosal specimens from CD patients has demonstrated increased expression of IL-17A, lacking in GS patients [20] .",

They hypothesized that the common clinical manifestations might signal a genetic link. This called for further studies to establish whether gluten consumption was a triggered genetic susceptibility, as suggested by Dohan [26] . Subsequent observations often provided contrasting results. Epidemiological studies, such as that of the National Danish Register [5] , found that celiac disease occurred before onset of schizophrenia and that antibody-based diagnosis was a risk factor for SCZ. A higher than expected prevalence of certain autoimmune disorders (including CD) was also found [1] before onset of schizophrenia in patients diagnosed with this mental illness and their relatives. Almost at the same time, Ludvigsson [27] demonstrated that individuals with CD may be at increased risk of non-affective psychosis but not SCZ. However, analysis of data collected by the UK General Practice Research Database indicated that the risk of SCZ in patients diagnosed with autoimmune gastrointestinal disease (CD, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) was no higher than in the general population [28] . Studies on the effect of eliminating gluten from the diet of schizophrenic patients, reviewed by Kalaydjian et al. [6] , showed that psychotic symptoms only declined in a subset of patients. These results are therefore contradictory: on one hand they suggest a common autoimmune pathway for celiac disease and schizophrenia, but on the other they refute it.",

Uncertainty in disease classification and the absence of reliable methods, especially in older studies, may therefore explain these conflicting results. Some studies may also have been biased by the fact that that certain SCZ patients were not tested for the antibodies. However, this bias was overcome by studies in which antibody levels characterizing celiac disease were determined in schizophrenic patients. A study conducted in Israel to detect anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) showed no difference between a group with chronic SCZ and a group of healthy controls [29] . Since EMA are very specific for celiac disease, this result could be interpreted as pointing to certain negativity for CD. However, since antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (a-tTG) and anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) were not investigated, this result cannot exclude gluten sensitivity in this group of patients, as suggested by increasing evidence that GS is frequent in schizophrenia [8, 30] .",

From the serologic characterization of this patient sample, two groups emerged: one with elevated IgA AGA indicative of gluten sensitivity and the other with EMA and/or a-tTG plus IgA AGA, markers indicative of celiac disease. Thus the great majority of schizophrenic patients showed a dramatically higher prevalence of AGA antibodies than the comparison group, while reactivity to a-tTG was only mildly increased and reactivity to EMA was even lower. The discrepancy between the levels of a-tTG and EMA was recognized to be crucial, since they target the same antigen, and this indicated the need for further research. The authors suggested that the results may have been biased by the different assay techniques used: indirect immunofluorescence for EMA and ELISA for a-tTG. Another theory was that the low level of EMA determined the milder intestinal damage observed in GS.",

[30] screened the same population of schizophrenic patients for transglutaminase 6 antibodies (a-tTG-6) [31] . As gluten causes an immune response to tTG, it was reasonable to suppose that tTG isoforms other than tTG2 could be involved, for instance tTG-6, which would not cause intestinal but psychiatric manifestations. The authors looked for a-tTG-6 antibodies, which are primarily expressed in the brain and are reported to be elevated in gluten ataxia; they observed increased prevalence in SCZ patients. A reasonable explanation is that gluten may reach the brain through a breach in the blood-brain barrier and stimulate an immune response similar to that observed towards intestinal mucosa, leading neurons to expose tTG-6. As well, gluten seems to trigger release of zonulin, a modulator of the blood-brain barrier and the precursor for haptoglobin-2, an inflammatory marker found elevated in a subgroup of schizophrenic patients. This could explain increased blood-brain barrier permeability, allowing passage of gluten peptides and activated inflammatory cells. It also suggests the potential implications of a gluten-free diet (GFD) for the treatment of schizophrenia.",

In a general population-based cohort study in Sweden, Ludviggson et al. [12] also found increased risk of subsequent depression in individuals suffering from celiac disease. Siniscalchi et al. [36] observed that fatigue was common in celiac patients and was not related to GFD, though it seemed less intense in treated patients. They found that celiac patients on GFD showed stronger depression symptoms than celiacs on a normal diet. Data gathered by Hauser [49] showed that the duration of the GFD was not related to depressed mood, and this was the same for anxiety. Nonetheless, while CD patients on GFD were not more depressed than controls, female CD patients on GFD seemed at increased risk of developing anxiety disorder.",

However, the increase in IgA a-tTG [30] was not accompanied by an increase in levels of anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA), excluding the possibility of celiac disease. Regarding schizophrenia, antibodies to gliadin did not show significant affinity for deamidated gliadin peptides, again excluding the possibility of celiac disease but suggesting a response to gluten with different antigen specificity in a majority of gluten-sensitive individuals with schizophrenia [9] . On the contrary, Dickerson et al. [13] found evidence of increased levels of IgG DGP in BD patients, though this result was not replicated in the later study [14] . There have also been few studies on bipolar disorder and gluten sensitivity, however, they all yielded results consistent with an increase in IgG AGA levels [13] [14] [15] , whereas some studies on schizophrenia and gluten sensitivity only found an increase in IgA AGA [30, 50] .",

            "text": "A deeper understanding of the immune alterations documented in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is currently impossible. Many theories have been put forward. Focusing on bipolar disorder, immune activation is not likely to directly affect the brain [14] . Altered mechanisms of absorption of food protein and therefore processing of food antigen are possibly involved, in line with documented heightened immune activation towards milk caseins [52] in this disorder. It is also worth noting the increasing evidence in support of the role played by infections, more than autoimmune diseases, in the pathogenesis of mood disorders [4] . Infection by Toxoplasma gondii [53] and other neurotropic pathogens, such as influenza and coronavirus, is associated with MD [54] . In schizophrenia, Toxoplasma is suspected to directly affect the brain and the action of cytokines. Its passage may occur by alterations in intestinal permeability due to mimicry of enterocyte epitopes by gliadin [15] . A recent study has demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii [55] infections raise gluten antibody levels in mice, suggesting that it may alter transcellular passage of gluten peptides. Alterations in commensal gut microbiota have also been suggested to dysregulate the immune system, leading to production of antibodies [15] . Another recent study found that levels of SCD14, a marker of translocation of commensal microbiota, were significantly correlated with anti-tissue transglutaminase IgG in bipolar disorder [56] . We currently do not know whether alterations mainly involve intestinal breakdown, absorption, immune response to gliadin, autoantibody cross-reactivity, production of neuroactive peptides in altered digestion processes [14] or activation of T cell bystander and consequently B cells with antibody production [13, 52] . Altered permeability, gut microbiota alterations and infections could therefore all be putative pathogenetic mechanisms involved in SCZ and MD.",
