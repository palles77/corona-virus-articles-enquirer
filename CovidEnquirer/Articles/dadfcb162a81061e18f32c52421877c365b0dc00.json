Based on Weinstein's five-stage PAPM, a prospective model and a classification scheme for five corresponding types of self-protective behavior adopters are proposed in this study. By using ten-year longitudinal survey data provided by a timely research sample which was obtained from a multi-store restaurant's diner club members immediately after the peak period of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, both theoretical and managerial applicability of the proposed stage-based model are empirically verified in this study. The results show that the type of self-protective behavior respondents adopted is significantly associated with their marital status and risk attitude toward the epidemic. Besides, respondents significantly advance their type of self-protective behavior adoption along successive epidemics from the SARS to avian influenza A(H7N9) in decade.",

Of the diverse social contexts, one of the most popularly discussed contexts is where one plays the role of a worker in the workplace. As results, academic efforts have been largely made in the field of industrial safety to influence or encourage an individual worker's interest in and attitude to adopting greater extent of self-protective behavior against workplace hazards. Different from the passive attitude and reluctant propensity for adopting self-protective behavior (e.g., following standardized operational procedures) in a workplace, people are usually alert to the personal risks or dangers that exist in a marketplace where they are playing the role of a consumer and have no hesitation in adopting self-protective behavior (i.e., to suspend or cease the consumption of particular products) spontaneously. In other words, while operations management attempts to modify workers' self-protective behavior by developing and using innovative incentives or tailor-made occupational safety programs, similarly but more aggressively, marketing managers may have to eliminate or retard consumers' overreacting self-protective behavior by proposing rapid and effective marketing programs. However, in contrast to a number of conceptual models regarding workers' self-protective behavior (see the review in DeJoy, 1996) which have * Tel.: +886 4 2284 0392x767; fax: +886 4 2286 0993.",

Lakshmanan (2003, as cited by McKercher and Chon, 2004) aptly describes the feature of the outbreak by observing that 'a panic spread faster than the disease itself.' Some scholars (e.g., Chen et al., 2007; Chuo, 2007; McKercher and Chon, 2004) explain the phenomenon clearly that people were overreacting to the outbreak. As consequences of the consumers' self-protective behavior in response to the epidemic crisis, the costs of canceled travel and decreased investment in Asia might rival the Asian financial crisis of the mid-1990s (De Lisle, 2004) and the tourism and hospitality industries in Asia had almost completely collapsed (McKercher and Chon, 2004) . In fact, the industries are still threatened by the possibility of a new epidemic or pandemic crisis (Page et al., 2012) . Ten years after the SARS outbreak, human cases of infection with a novel avian influenza A(H7N9) were reported in eastern China on 31 March 2013. Since then, the number of notified cases reported to World Health Organization (WHO) has increased, reaching 137 cases (including 45 deaths) as of October 25",

            "text": "(http://www.who.int/influenza/human animal interface/ influenza h7n9/Data Reports/en/index.html). Since the evolution of the H7N9 epidemic in China has been observed, analyzed and reported as a signal indicating a possible risk of a larger outbreak in the very near future (Kelland, 2013; Morens and Fauci, 2013; Schenk et al., 2013; Yoshikura, 2013) , the successive crises from the SARS to the H7N9 epidemic in Asia provide an appropriate (if not the best) natural context for studies investigating consumers' self-protective behavior in the field of hospitality management. This study intends to develop and examine a model for restaurant diners' self-protective behavior in response to an epidemic crisis with longitudinal data consisting of research sample members' responses to both the 2003 SARS and the 2013 avian influenza A(H7N9) epidemics. Accordingly, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Research on perceived physical risk and selfprotective behavior is first summarized. Candidate models elicited from the above summary are briefly introduced and the applicability of the models for restaurant diners' self-protective behavior in response to an epidemic outbreak is deductively reviewed subsequently. A prospective model is proposed based on the most applicable model elicited from the above review and followed by the hypotheses formulated for this study. Afterward the procedural, measuring, and analytical design of the empirical examination on both theoretical and managerial applicability of the proposed model are described respectively. Finally, the analyzed results are presented and followed by a further discussion of the results and their implications. Ehrlich and Becker (1972) define a self-protective behavior as an averting behavior used by consumers to reduce the probability of an adverse outcome or as an action taken to reduce personal or group vulnerability to a risk. Taylor (1974) also indicates that a self-protective behavior is a corresponding function of a perceived risk which has been recognized by consumers. Perceived risk has been identified by six specific risk types in the extant literature, Jacoby and Kaplan (1972) depict five (i.e., financial, performance, physical, psychological and social risks) and Roselius (1971) identifies the other (i.e., time risk). Of the six risk types, this current study focuses on restaurant diners' perceived physical risk associated with possible plague infection which happened not only in the dining space but also in the mutual interactions between customers, service staff, and other customers in a restaurant dining service delivery system during an epidemic crisis.",

            "text": "As a corresponding function of an individual's perceived physical risk, individual's self-protective behavior has been explored and discussed in terms of industrial, food, and daily activity safety. One of the most popularly discussed social contexts is where one plays the role of a worker in the workplace. In terms of industrial safety, researchers (Cohen et al., 1979; Peters, 1991) examine and suggest effective strategies or techniques which can influence or encourage individual workers' interest in and attitude toward adopting greater extent of self-protective behavior against workplace hazards. More specifically, Vaughan (1993) examines immigrant workers' self-protective behavior in response to the environmental hazards of pesticide exposure. The other popularly discussed social context is where one plays the role of a consumer in the marketplace. Extant research regarding consumers' behavior resulted from their perceived physical risks has been mostly discussed in terms of 'food safety behavior.' In response to unsafe food such as milk containing the recombinant bovine growth hormone (rbGH) (e.g., Grobe and Douthitt, 1995) or beef contaminated by the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (e.g., Pennings et al., 2002) , the safety behaviors refer to actions being taken to assure the safety of food, including behaviors of seeking information, food preparation, and food purchase (Schafer et al., 1993) . Since the conceptual constructs and performing patterns of a person's selfprotective behavior appear to be different among diverse contexts where he/she plays different social roles in various daily activities, Weinstein (1989) extends the application and understanding of the individual's self-protective behavior to various daily situations. He discusses the effect of prior personal experiences of accidents and an individual's post self-protective behavior in response to the risk of the occurrence of future identical accidents occurrence in daily life, such as the attention to the use of seat belts in the event of automobile accidents, individual crime prevention efforts due to previous criminal victimization (except rape), natural hazard preparedness and compliance with evacuation warnings after prior experience of natural hazards, and changes in smoking behavior after the occurrence of myocardial infarction. On the other hand, in contrast to the comparisons between multiple contexts, Tewksbury (2003) specifically explores the effect of college students' lifestyle characteristics on their self-protective behavior of guardianship adoption in response to the risk of criminal victimization.",

They reveal that people's perceived personal susceptibility, self-efficacy (perceived sense of control), motivation to maintain good health, and demographics such as age, gender and household size can be used to predict consumers' self-protective behavior. Grobe et al. (1999) propose an rbGH risk-perception classification scheme based on Weinstein's (1988) five-stage precaution adoption process model and examine differences among research subjects classified by the scheme. In the study, they define 'consumer's self-protective behavior' as the actions such as seeking assurance that purchased milk came from non-treated herds and to reduce or stop milk consumption in response to the health threat caused by rbGH contained in milk. The findings of the above studies show that consumers' risk-attitude, product involvement, gender, age, education attainment, income, and household size are important factors associated with the undertaking of their self-protective behavior. Besides, the above consumer studies also provide a standard analytical design to examine a model's applicability to people's self-protective behavior in particular contexts.",

In the stage of 'precontemplation,' people do not seriously think about changing their behavior. Then, they start to think about changing their behavior in the near future (i.e., about six months) in the 'contemplation' stage. In the subsequent 'preparation' stage, people intend and have plans to make a behavioral change in the very near future. As the fourth stage, 'action' usually denotes a sixmonth period of time from the day starting the change of behavior. The final stage 'maintenance' refers to the time period from the end of action to the termination of changes in behavior. Weinstein (1988) proposes a five-stage PAPM to explain how a person comes to decisions to take action and how he or she translates that decision into action (see Table 1 ). There are two assumptions underlying the model. First, an individual advancing to the next stage needs to accept the idea defining the current stage. Second, the stages are cumulative. Accordingly, the model assumes that one must advance through a series of distinct stages before taking an action to protect oneself. The first stage occurs when an individual learns of the existence of the hazard. In stage two, the individual believes that there is a significant probability that others will experience the hazard. Subsequently, the individual in the third stage believes he/she is personally susceptible to the hazard. In the fourth stage, the individual expresses the intention to engage in self-protective behavior. The individual may persist in the fourth stage by means of using barriers such as financial cost, time cost, or social cost (e.g., embarrassing nature of the protective behavior). Finally, only by adopting the self-protective behavior may the individual advance to the final stage of the process.",

In fact, the added 'maintenance' had been uniquely proposed in the TTM and the expanded PAPM seems to be much more applicable to people's reluctant health behaviors (e.g., dietary change and smoking cessation).

However, a substantial amount of research on biases in risk perception shows that the estimation of risk probability tends to be a complex process (see the review in Van der Pligt, 1998 for details). Although researchers recognize substantial biases arose from quantitative risk estimations, Van der Pligt (1996) indicates that most research on health behavior seems to disregard the substantial biases and assume that people are able to accurately estimate the magnitude of risks they take. Consistent with findings of the studies regarding biases in individual's risk perception, Chuo (2007) even suggests that the magnitude of people's aversion to the plague (risk attitude) rather than the perceived possibility of being infected by the plague (risk perception) tended to be the dominant determinant in the formulation of the SARS-generated panic.",

At first, the initial data collection of this study had to be organized promptly and implemented quickly during or soon after the outbreak since Raphael (1987) indicates that a potential recall bias exists in epidemic-related retrospective research. However, the second horn is that a number of consumers ceased their consumption completely during and even shortly after the outbreak period. In addition, to take possible evolution of individual's self-protective behavior over time into consideration, a case study seemed to be an appropriate, if not the best, approach to reach consumers of a wide range of self-protective behaviors during the SARS outbreak and to investigate their subsequent self-protective behaviors to the following avian influenza A(H7N9) epidemic.",

            "text": "However, the extent of restaurant diner's self-protective behavior progresses is moderated by a 'self-regulated priming effect (Higgins, 1997) ' which is triggered by restaurant diners' own marital status in the crisis context. Many studies have been widely conducted to investigate the self-regulated priming effect on a variety of consumers' behavior by manipulating their self-view through such as referencing tasks (e.g., Aaker and Williams, 1998) , situational contexts (e.g., Briley et al., 2000) , and primes (e.g., Gardner et al., 1999) . Among these studies, Mandel (2003) reveals a self-construal priming effect on consumers' risk-taking (the antithesis of self-protective) behavior and confirms that individuals demonstrate varying degrees of risk tolerance across experimental manipulations in which either their 'independent self' or 'dependent self' is primed. Aaker and Lee (2001) assure that consumers of an independent self tend to be gain-attainment focused and those of an interdependent self tend to be loss-prevention focused. Besides, Lee et al. (2000) confirm that consumers with a gainattainment focus will regulate their behavior toward positive outcomes such as hedonic advancement and pleasure achievement, while those with a loss-prevention focus will regulate their behavior toward negative outcomes such as safety assurance and warranty request. As an application of the above research findings, restaurant diners may tend to be either gain-attainment or loss-prevention focused and demonstrate varying degrees of risk aversion when their independent or dependent self-view is activated. In specific, when restaurant diners' independent self is activated in response to an epidemic crisis, they may tend to limit the progression of their self-protective behavior in order to attain gains (e.g., convenience, enjoyments of the senses and hedonic experiences) from their dining service patronage. Contrary, those whose dependent self is activated may tend to adopt advanced types of self-protective behavior to avoid potential losses (e.g., personal infection or risking their lives) caused by the patronage in such a crisis. Therefore, results of this study 'significant more married restaurant diners were found in relatively advanced types (i.e., Type 4 and Type 5) of self-protective behavior adopters and more unmarried restaurant diners were found in less-advanced types of self-protective behavior adopters' can be interpreted with the above reasoning that married restaurant diners' dependent self and unmarried restaurant diners' independent self seem to be activated respectively in response to an epidemic crisis and the progression of their self-protective behavior adoption is correspondingly moderated by the self-regulated priming effect.",

Since perceived sense of control, perceived personal avertibility, and magnitude of aversion are assured to be distinctive psychographic characteristics between types of restaurant diners in this study, it can be expected that their self-protective behavior will be minified in effect if (1) the trend of outbreak is perceived controllable; (2) official and medical supports are perceived not only sufficient but also effective; and (3) their aversion to the epidemic can be relieved.

While people of 'unrealistic optimism' tend to estimate their risk of experiencing a negative event as below average to comparable others (Weinstein, 1980) , restaurant diners' over-reacting self-protective behavior in the context of epidemic outbreak could be realized as a consequence triggered by their 'unrealistic pessimism' of vulnerability. Since the unrealistic pessimism tends to amplify people's estimation of the risk perception (i.e., estimated probability of infection) in an epidemic crisis, 'comparative risk appraisal (Van der Pligt, 1998; Radcliffe and Klein, 2002; Weinstein, 1984) '-the level of risk a person estimates he/she is taking compared to others-may preclude the effect of subjective biases on risk estimation through a comparative approach. By using the substitute, further research could be carried out to examine the effect of unrealistic pessimism on restaurant diners' self-protective behavior in response to various types of crises. However, when consumer's overreacting self-protective behavior is assumed to be amplified by their significant unrealistic pessimism, it should be noticed that Weinstein's PAPM seems not so appropriate to be the conceptual framework underlying the self-protective behavior since the sequential nature of the model presumes implicitly that people have to perceive other's risk before their personal risk when facing a particular crisis.",
