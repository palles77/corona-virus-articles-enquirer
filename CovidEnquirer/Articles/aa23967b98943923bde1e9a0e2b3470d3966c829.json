            "text": "A strategy for targeted RNA recombination between the spike gene on the genomic RNA of MHV-A59 and a synthetic DI RNA containing the MHV-RI spike gene is described. The MHV-RI spike gene contains several nucleotide differences from the MHV-A59 spike gene that could be used as genetic markers, including a stretch of 156 additional nucleotides starting at nucleotide 1497. The MHV-RI S gene cDNA (from nucleotide 277-termination codon) was inserted in frame into pMIDI, a full-length cDNA clone of an MHV-A59 DI, yielding pDPRIS. Using the vaccinia vTF7.3 system, RNA was transcribed from pDPRIS upon transfection into MHV-A59-infected L cells. DPRIS RNA was shown to be replicated and passaged efficiently. MHV-A59 and the DPRIS DI particle were copassaged several times. Using a highly specific and sensitive RT-PCR, recombinant genomic RNA was detected in intracellular RNA from total lysates of pDPRIS-transfected and MHV-A59infected cells and among genomic RNA that was agarose gel-purified from these lysates. More significantly, specific PCR products were found in virion RNA from progeny virus. PCR products were absent in control mixes of intracellular RNA from MHV-A59-infected cells and in vitro-transcribed DPRIS RNA. PCR products from intracellular RNA and virion RNA were cloned and 11 independent clones were sequenced. Crossovers between A59 and RI RNA were found upstream of nucleotide 1497 and had occurred between 106 nucleotides from the 5-border and 73 nucleotides from the 3-border of sequence homologous between A59 and RI S genes. We conclude that homologous RNA recombination took place between the genomic RNA template and the synthetic DI RNA template at different locations, generating a series of MHV recombinant genomes with chimeric S genes. \u1b67 1997 Academic Press",

These Thus, the genomic RNAs containing the chimeric A59/RI primers were used for PCR on the P2 and P4 intracellular RNA samples in which the presence of recombinant RNAs was confirmed by the recombinant-specific RT-PCR shown above (C142 for RT and C143 and C147 for PCR). C142 was used for the reverse transcription and C143 in combination with each of the antisense primers, including C188 as positive control, was used for PCR. Only the primer pair C143/C188 resulted in the amplification of a specific fragment (data not shown). This indicates that the double MHV polymerase jump occurred between nt 277 and the position of primer C189, which is nt 1883.",

The spike gene in DPRIS is discontinuously fused to the terminal sequences from the MHV genome re-because full-length infectious cDNA clones have been constructed. This has profoundly advanced the study of quired for replication of the DI RNA. Therefore, double homologous recombination events are required for the viral replication and pathogenesis (Hahn et al., 1989a; 1989b; Lustig et al., 1988; Kohara et al., 1985;  La Monica introduction of a mutation into the genomic A59 S gene.

However, for MHV, the extreme length of the genome poses naviruses occurs by a copy-choice mechanism in which the polymerase jumps between templates, as was first an obvious technical problem. The only possibility to mutagenize site-specifically the MHV genome is currently proposed by Kirkegaard and Baltimore (1986) . Thus to mutate the genomic S gene, first an homologous jump by using homologous RNA recombination and several successful attempts have been reported (Koetzner et al., from the genomic RNA template to the synthetic DI RNA template must occur and then jumping back again to the 1992; Masters et al., 1994; Van der Most et al., 1992) .",

(A) Detection of recombinant genomic RNA. Oligo C142 was used for RT and C143 and C147 for PCR (seeFig. 5for oligo positions). C142 and C143 bind to the sequences in the ORF 4 and HE gene, respectively, which are absent in DPRIS. C147 binds to the region in the RI S gene absent in the A59 S gene. A 1.65kb recombinant-specific PCR product (indicated by the arrow) was detected in lanes 1 to 5. The control of intracellular MHV-A59 RNA mixed with 1:10 diluted in vitro-synthesized DPRIS RNA gave no signal (lane 6). No specific PCR product was detected in intracellular RNA from only MHV-A59 infected cells (lane 7). An aspecific band of approximately 3 kb was found in all lanes except the MHV-A59 lane.
