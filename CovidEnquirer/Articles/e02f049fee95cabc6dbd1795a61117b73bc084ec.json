            "text": "As developed nations continue to strengthen their electronic disease surveillance capacities [1] , the parts of the world that are most vulnerable to emerging disease threats still lack essential public health information infrastructure [2, 3] . The existing network of traditional surveillance efforts managed by health ministries, public health institutes, multinational agencies, and laboratory and institutional networks has wide gaps in geographic coverage and often suffers from poor and sometimes suppressed information flow across national borders [4] . At the same time, an enormous amount of valuable information about infectious diseases is found in Web-accessible information sources such as discussion sites, disease reporting networks, and news outlets [5, 6, 7] . These resources can support situational awareness by providing current, highly local information about outbreaks, even from areas relatively invisible to traditional global public health efforts [8] . These data are plagued by a number of potential hazards that must be studied in depth, including false reports (mis-or disinformation) and reporting bias. Yet these data hold tremendous potential to initiate epidemiologic follow-up studies and provide complementary epidemic intelligence context to traditional surveillance sources. This potential is already being realized, as a majority of outbreak verifications currently conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are triggered by reports from these nontraditional sources [5, 6] .",

With the aim of creating an integrated global view of emerging infections based not only on traditional public health datasets but rather on all available information sources, we developed HealthMap, a freely accessible, automated electronic information system for organizing data on outbreaks according to geography, time, and infectious disease agent [16] ( Figure 1 ).",

Furthermore, other biases may be intentionally introduced for political reasons through disinformation campaigns (false positives) or state censorship of information relating to outbreaks (false negatives). We have attempted to better understand some of these issues through ongoing analysis and evaluation research. We ran a 43-week evaluation of HealthMap data, covering the period of October 1, 2006 through July 18 2007. We found that pathogen diversity was substantial across news sources, with 141 unique infectious disease categories reported through the Google News feed alone (Table 1) . We found the frequency of reports about particular pathogens to be related not to their associated morbidity or mortality impact, but rather to the direct or potential economic and social disruption caused by the outbreak.",

There was a clear bias towards increased reporting from countries with higher numbers of media outlets, more developed public health resources, and greater availability of electronic communication infrastructure (approximated by number of Internet hosts) ( Figure 3B ).

Once the reports are automatically processed, curators correct the misclassifications of the system where necessary (Figure 2) . Currently, only one analyst reviews and corrects the posts. However, additional resources would enable more detailed multilingual curation and annotation of collected reports. Extracting location and disease names from text reports presents the most formidable challenge. HealthMap draws from a continually expanding dictionary of pathogens (human, plant, and animal diseases) and geographic names (country, province, state, and city) to classify outbreak alert information. However, disease and place names are often ambiguous, colloquial, and subject to change, and may have multiple spellings (e.g., diarrhea, common in the US, and diarrhoea, common in the UK).

In this case, HealthMap makes use of a Bayesian machine learning algorithm, trained on manually characterized existing reports, to automatically tag and separate breaking news.
