Clinical signs of CCV infection vary from inapparent to those of rapidly fatal gastroenteritis. It is impossible to distinguish between the various causes of gastroenteritis by clinical signs. Mixed infections with two or more agents, including bacteria and parasites, occur in nature, which further complicates the diagnosis of canine enteritis (Vandenberghe et al., 1980; Yasoshima et al., 1983) .",

Enveloped viruses are commonly inactivated by treatment with detergents, and solubilized antigens have therefore been widely used as non-infectious antigens in ELISA. We chose sodium deoxycholate for antigen solubilization because it is reported that the presence of the detergent, whatever the concentration, does not interfere with the adsorption of antigens to the solid phase (Jeansson et al., 1982) . The original solubilized antigen solution contains about 2 mg/ml of protein, so 1 ml of antigen would be sufficient for 20 antigen-coated plates. The antigen preparation and assay procedures developed in this study are simple, so that this ELISA method will be useful in large-scale epidemiological surveys of CCV infection in the field. In the experimental infection, ELISA antibody was first detected about 3 days after the appearance of NT antibody. We suspect that this was because our ELISA procedure detects only IgG subclass antibodies and does not detect antibodies of other classes -probably IgM -that may be produced during the early stage of infection and detected by NT.",

Conclusive diagnosis requires isolation of the virus from feces, but attempts to isolate the virus have been unsuccessful in many previous reports (Cartwright and Lucas, 1972; Williams, 1980; Marshall et al., 1984) as well as in the present work. The reason for this is uncertain. As shown in Table 2 , we also failed to isolate virus from necropsied samples of ELISApositive organs; however, the results of ELISA were correlated with those of IFA for almost all specimens. The high ELISA values observed for fecal specimens were reduced after incubation of the specimen with dog serum containing anti-CCV antibody, but was not reduced by incubation with antibody-free serum. These observations indicate the specificity of our ELISA procedure for the detection of CCV antigen in feces and organ homogenates; it is important that any ELISA method used in the field detects only CCV antigens and not other antigens such as canine parvovirus, canine rotavirus, food antigens etc. Although we were unable to examine the reactivity of the two antisera (capture and detector antibodies) with antigens other than CCV, these antisera were prepared from healthy animals of species other than the dog (cat and rabbit), so it seems unlikely that both sera simultaneously possess the same antibodies against other canine pathogens and food antigens. We used polyclonal antisera in this study, but it is likely that the use of monoclonal antibody as the detector will improve specificity.",
