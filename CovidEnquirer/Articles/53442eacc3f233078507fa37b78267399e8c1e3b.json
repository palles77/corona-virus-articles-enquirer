            "text": "Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a causative agent for poor pregnancy outcome and fetal developmental abnormalities, including microcephaly and eye defects. As a result, ZIKV is now a confirmed teratogen. Understanding host-pathogen interactions, specifically cellular perturbations caused by ZIKV, can provide novel therapeutic targets. In order to complete viral replication, viral pathogens control the host cellular machineries and regulate various factors, including long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes, at transcriptional levels. The role of lncRNA genes in the pathogenesis of ZIKV-mediated microcephaly and eye defects is currently unknown. To gain additional insights, we focused on profiling the differentially expressed lncRNA genes during ZIKV infection in mammalian cells. For this study, we employed a contemporary clinical Zika viral isolate, PRVABC59, of Asian genotype. We utilized an unbiased RNA sequencing approach to profile the lncRNA transcriptome in ZIKV infected Vero cells. We identified a total of 121 lncRNA genes that are differentially regulated at 48 hours post-infection. The majority of these genes are independently validated by reverse-transcription qPCR. A notable observation was that the lncRNAs, MALAT1 (Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1) and NEAT1 (Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1), are down-regulated upon Zika viral infection. MALAT1 and NEAT1 are known as nuclear localized RNAs that regulate gene expression and cell proliferation. Protein-lncRNA interaction maps revealed that MALAT1 and NEAT1 share common interacting partners and form a larger network comprising of 71 cellular factors. ZIKV-mediated dysregulation of these two regulatory lncRNAs can alter the expression of respective target genes and associated biological functions, an important one being cell division. In conclusion, this investigation is the first to provide insight into the biological connection of lncRNAs and ZIKV which can be further explored for developing antiviral therapy and understanding fetal developmental processes.",

The presence of lncRNAs has been frequently determined with high confidence from transcriptomes and microarray technologies [8] . The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project Consortium (GENCODE release 24) estimates that the human genome incorporates around 62% of 25,823 ncRNA genes as lncRNA genes that encode 28,031 well-defined lncRNA transcripts (http://www.gencodegenes.org). The minority of the non-coding transcripts are small, whereas, the majority of them exceed 200 nucleotides in length, and they are consequently cataloged as lncRNAs [9] . While this practical definition is fairly arbitrary, the size cutoff clearly differentiates lncRNAs from small regulatory RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) that participate in RNA interference (RNAi), and Piwi-associated RNAs (piRNAs). It is noted that the classical ncRNAs are ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), ribozymes, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and telomere-associated RNAs (TERC, TERRA) [10] . The majority of the lncRNA transcripts are expressed from intergenic regions and, to a lesser extent, in the protein-coding gene regions as sense or antisense transcripts.",

CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. are associated with numerous key cellular processes, such as embryonic stem cell pluripotency, immune response, regulation of the cell cycle, and diseases such as cancer [9, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, the function of the majority of lncRNAs remains unknown [10] . Even though lncRNAs exert a spectrum of regulatory mechanisms across different cellular pathways, a broad theme is emerging in which lncRNAs are driving the assembly of RNA-protein complexes that can facilitate the regulation of gene expression. Knowing that there is an interaction between lncRNAs and protein coding genes in both normal and disease states is essential to uncover the key functional roles of lncRNAs in cellular and developmental processes [18, 19] . Thus, we carried out transcriptome analysis to determine expression patterns of lncRNAs in the ZIKV infected Vero cells that serve as a mammalian cell model. This study provides new insight into the interaction between ZIKV and its host.",

Hence, we focused on identifying the factors that can interact with lncRNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 using RAIN and STRING. Initial seed interaction networks for NEAT1 and MALAT1 predicted a maximum of 20 interacting factors ( Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 ). There were 20 and 19 high confidence nodes that involved in 31 and 32 interactions for NEAT1 and MALAT1 networks, respectively. Almost, all the interactions in these two independent networks were supported by text-mining. Afterwards, the factors interacted with each of the two lncRNAs and were combined to find the common interacting factors (Figure 4 ). We identified two lncRNAs namely MIAT and TUG1 as common Comprehensive lncRNA-Protein interaction network. Proteins collectively contribute to a shared and specific function. For instance, if a single edge appears with different lines/colors between two nodes, this clearly indicates that the interaction between two given genes/nodes is supported by more than one verification [25] .

With the evidence from the interacting network, we identified known co-expressing genes that are differentially regulated during ZIKV infection from our genome-wide gene expression data sets. We extended our analysis using the 11 interacting factors defined in our previous analysis for further comprehensive interacting network analysis in order to identify more high confidence co- Table 3 ). It is possible that 5 lncRNAs having interactions with 24 proteins may form post-transcriptional regulatory networks [27] [28] [29] , and control fundamental cellular and developmental processes. We also observed that apart from the text-mining, the majority of the lncRNA-protein interactions were supported by experimental evidence. progression. We found that the cell cycle pathways and various cell cycle genes including CDK1, Cyclin B, E2F, and p21 were deregulated in ZIKV infected cells (Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

The reaction for each gene expression was completed in duplicate and housekeeping human gene, Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), was used as an internal reference control. The list of qPCR primers and their sequences are given in Supplementary Table 1. The following conditions were used for real-time amplification of the cDNA: 50\u00b0C for 2 min; 95\u00b0C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec and 60\u00b0C for 1 min.

Subsequently, the combined NEAT1 and MALAT1 interaction analyses were carried out in the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) v10.0 database[25]. To avoid false positive results, a high confidence interaction score of 0.7 was used as a cut-off to obtain a maximum of 20 interactions under evidence mode for each of the two lncRNAs. The combined interacting network of these two lncRNAs with other human proteins was also predicted. The comprehensive interaction network was predicted using the 11 identified differentially co-expressed genes in normal and ZIKV infected conditions.Typically, the interaction network view summarizes the predicted associations for a specific group of proteins. The network nodes are proteins whereas the edges represent the predicted functional associations. The evidence mode based edges are drawn in with up to 7 differently colored lines representing the existence of the seven types of evidences. The evidence falls under 3 broad categories, namely known interactions, predicted interactions and other interactions, which was used in predicting the associations. The known interactions include the evidence that was experimentally determined (pink) or the evidence that was curated from database (sky blue). The predicted interactions depict the evidence of gene neighborhood (green), gene fusion (red) or gene co-occurrence (blue). The other interactions show evidence of co-expression (black), text-mining (light green) and protein homology (purple).

The transcriptome of all 14 samples from the Vero cells both with and without Zika viral infection were characterized at three different time points (12, 24, and 48 hpi) by RNA-Seq. After mapping with human transcriptome, 65-69% of overall mapping was observed per sample, >80% of the reads were successfully mapped to the exonic region in each sample and >80% of the aligned reads were uniquely mapped, which confirms the high quality of our samples and sequencing. We focused on identifying lncRNA mRNA that are differentially expressed between uninfected and ZIKV infected cells. The changes in lncRNA expression were observed only at the later time point of 48 hpi.
