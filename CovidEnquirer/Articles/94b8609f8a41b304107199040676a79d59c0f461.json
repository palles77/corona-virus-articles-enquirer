However, the discovery and development of new antibacterial drugs is a crucial step to overcome the great challenge posed by the emergence of antibiotic resistance. In this review, we outline recent advances in the development of novel AMPs with improved antimicrobial activities that were achieved through characteristic structural design. In addition, we describe recent progress made to overcome some of the major limitations that have hindered peptide biosynthesis.",

It is estimated that, from 1981 to 2006, anti-infective agents based on natural product scaffolds accounted for up to 75% of all approved antibacterial new chemical entities (NCEs), thus attesting for the importance of natural products as the main source of therapeutics against pathogenic bacteria [2] . In this context, microorganisms, notably members of the Gram-positive phylum Actinomycetes, have been the workhouse source of clinically approved antibacterial agents. The high diversity of candidate molecules extracted from microorganisms frequently leads to the discovery of new compounds with distinct mechanisms of action compared with drugs currently used for clinical purposes. However, in recent years, the traditional screening of drug candidates belonging to completely new antibacterial classes from microbial sources has suffered a considerable decline, mostly because of the presence of numerous, already well-characterized, molecules [3] .",

These molecules are versatile, highly specific antimicrobial compounds that constitute promising candidates for commercial and clinical uses. AMPs are essential components of the innate immune system of vertebrates and the nonspecific host defense system of plants, fungi, and invertebrates that evolved over 2.6 billion years ago as potent anti-infective agents against different viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. These small peptides usually comprise 10-50 amino acid residues and are 2-9 kDa in size [1] . Commonly, they show a cationic structure rich in positively charged arginine and lysine residues, which favors the interaction between these peptides and microbial cytoplasmic membranes. However, although less common, there are also anionic AMPs, notably in plants. AMPs usually kill pathogens by interacting with membrane phospholipids, resulting in membrane permeabilization and subsequent disruption. These peptides also show different secondary structures, such as b-sheets stabilized by two or three disulfide bridges and often display a helical amphipathic structure [1] [2] [3] .",

The driving force of such interaction is the electrostatic force presented by the AMP, which is normally cationic, and the polyanionic surface of bacteria [5, 11] . Differences in the cell wall composition among bacterial groups affect directly the mode of action of AMPs. Gram-negative bacteria present three major layers in the cell envelope: (i) the outer membrane (OM), comprising a lipid bilayer, mostly of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interlaced by teichoic acid, which has a major role in protection against the environment; (ii) the peptidoglycan cell wall, comprising repeated units of a disaccharide (N-acetyl glucosamine-Nacetylmuramic acid) linked by pentapeptide side chains; and (iii) the cytoplasmic membrane-phospholipid bilayer.

Phosphorylated PhoP activates the transcription of the QueE gene, encoding an enzyme that controls the biosynthesis of hypermodified guanosine found in rare tRNAs and, once overexpressed, inhibits cell division by downregulating the bacterial divisome [12, 13] .",

The addition of glycine to lipid A is regulated by the almEFG operon, which controls the expression of several proteins (AImE, AlmF, and AlmG) related to glycine activation and transfer to lipid A. Glycine is activated by adenylation by AlmE, which transfers active glycine to the 4 0 -phosphopantetheine group of AlmF.

Diverse engineered cationic antimicrobial peptides (eCAPs) have been synthetically produced in laboratories worldwide, and show a range of in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities. Examination of structure-function relations is primarily performed for the prediction of protein interfaces to infer protein-protein and protein-lipid interaction networks [7, 37] . Interface prediction is based on the physicochemical properties of residues in interfaces of protein complexes and by overlapping interface and non-interface segments of protein motifs. The most prominent characteristics of AMPs for peptide design are the sequence conservation of interface residues, proportion of the 20 types of amino acid residue, relative presence of secondary structures, solvent accessibility, and sidechain conformational entropy [38] .",

Most surface glycans are post-translationally added in the Golgi after the peptide has passed through the secretory pathway [39] . Plantderived AMPs are the main primary targets for glycosylation engineering that aims to improve biological activity against phytopathogens and to humanize glycosylation for clinical use in humans. Plant N-glycans differ considerably from those in mammals. Typically, mammalian a1,6 fucose (N-acetylglucosamine of the core), b1,4N-acetylglucosamine (b-mannose of the core), and b1,4 galactose combined with sialic acid and linked to the terminal N-acetylglucosamine are substituted in plants, by an a1,3 fucose, a bisecting b1,2 xylose, and a b1,3 galactose and fucose a1,4-linked to the terminal N-acetylglucosamine, respectively [40, 41] . Another important issue concerning the humanization of AMP glycosylation is avoiding the addition of allergenic glycoepitopes to the peptide surface, because humans are frequently allergic to plant a1,3 fucose and b2 xylose. Currently, the main efforts to minimize undesirable plant glycosylation of AMPs rely on avoiding the complete transit throughout the secretory pathway by confining peptides inside the endoplasmic reticulum, using N-or C-terminal retention signals, such as KDEL. Advances in the humanization of the glycosylation of proteins (i.e. the full substitution of non-mammalian host N-linked glycans for typical human glycans by knocking down plant xylosyl and fucosyltransferases and yeast mannosidases and expression of human glycosidases) is already a reality in the production of plant and yeast antibodies and interferons, but has not yet been fully applied to AMPs [41, 42] .",

The process is based on the infiltration of whole plants with a suspension of transgenic Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells carrying plasmids that encode viral RNAs replicons (Fig. 2) . These Gram-negative soil bacteria have key roles in infection and movement throughout plant tissues because they systemically spread through the plant to eventually reach most leaves and stems [8, 63] . Infiltrated plants contain viral vectors based on tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or potato virus X (PVX) carrying AMP-coding sequences, delivered by bacteria to be transiently expressed and amplified [64] . These potent machines of transcript production use the viral machinery to enhance the production of viral proteins along with the selected AMP, without stable transgene integration, resulting in massive yields of AMPs [65] .",

However, frequent gene silencing at the transcriptional level and instability of genes cloned in vectors for stable or transient expression remain major challenges limiting the efficient production of AMPs. Another persistent issue is the poor quality of the peptides endogenously synthesized in bacteria, yeast, and plants, particularly resulting from undesirable post-translational modifications [2, 33] . Improved targeted genome engineering represents a sophisticated approach that could help minimize such limitations. Over the past decade, alternative genome-editing tools, such as artificial engineered enzymes, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), and transcription-activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), have been successfully utilized to modify the genome of microbes, plants, and animals by adding, removing, or replacing segments of DNA [66] .",

CRISPRs constitute an incredibly versatile genome-editing platform derived from the S. pyogenes CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) [67, 68] . There are three types of CRISPRs. Type II is the simplest, presented only by bacteria and comprises four proteins (i.e. Cas1, Cas2, Cas9, and Cas4); it is the most widely used system for gene engineering. The most popular CRISPR-Cas system is constituted by Cas9 endonuclease proteins and CRISPR RNAs [68] . The nuclease Cas9 can catalyze the precise cleavage of target sites assisted by two short helper RNAs: cRNA and tracRNA. The fusion of both RNAs forms a hybrid single guide RNA (sgRNA) that binds to Cas9 to form a supramolecular complex named RNA-guided endonuclease, a sequence-specific recognizer complex that cleaves at specific sites in the genome, resulting in DSBs that are then repaired preferentially by HDR (in the case of bacterial genomes), thus altering the genome in a precise manner by site-specific modifications [69] .",

CRISPR/Cas system II technology description for AMP biosynthesis mediated by genome edition. Spacer acquisition: (a) Formation of CRISPRs array by recognition and integration of foreign DNA as spacer within the CRISPR locus, or fully synthesized by genetic engineering. The protospacers are non-coding region inserted in the bacterial DNA with 24-48 bp. Adjacent to each protospacer are found 3-5 bp short DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM) crRNA processing: (b) The CRISPR array is transcribed as a long RNA (pre-crRNA) that is cleaved into crRNAs with the help of Cas proteins. An extra small RNA (tracrRNA) complementary to the repeat sequence is also synthesized. (c) The tracrRNA pairs with the repeated region of crRNA and helps in the processing of pre-crRNA into crRNA with the help of RNAse III for cleavage. Interference stage: crRNAS binds to Ca proteins (d) to form a complex that recognizes foreign DNA (e). A single multifunctional protein, Cas9, recruits crRNA and tracrRNA to cleave the recognized foreign DNA using internal endonuclease domains (f). All the process is based in the recognition and pairing of the PAM and the foreign DNA. Double strand breaks (DSBs) are generated (g).
