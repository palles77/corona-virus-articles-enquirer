In the first phase, we discarded reads that mapped to rRNA and tRNA sequences with Bowtie parameters '-n 2 -seedlen 23 -k 1 --norc'. In the second phase, we mapped the remaining reads to the transcriptome with Bowtie parameters '-v 2 -a --strata --best -norc -m 200'. We attempted to extend alignments to their maximal length by comparing the polyA adaptor with the aligned transcript until reaching the maximal allowed error (2 mismatches across the read, with 3'-end mismatches avoided). We filtered out reads longer than 31-nt and shorter than 21-nt. Unique alignments were first assigned to the ribosome occupancy profiles. For multiple alignments, the best alignments in terms of number of mismatches were kept. Then, multiple aligned reads were distributed between locations according to the distribution of unique ribosomal reads in the respective surrounding regions. To this end, a 100-nt window was used to compute the read count density (total read counts in the window divided by length, based on unique reads) in vicinity of the M multiple aligned positions in the transcriptome, and the fraction of a read assigned to each position was . The location of the A-site was approximated by an 11nt shift from the 5' end of the aligned read.

The ribosome profiling method produces ribosome footprint counts that are proportional to the time spent in decoding each codon of all translated transcripts in a genome, at single nucleotide resolution. To avoid analyzing ribosomal profiles of genes with many missing read counts (RCs) that may result in a non-reliable estimation of the local ribosome density, genes profiles with fewer than 30 percent non-zero read counts were further filtered. Previous studies indicated an increase of RCs at the beginning of the ORF 4 and for some organisms at the end of ORF 4,5 ; therefore the first and last 20 codons were excluded when determining these thresholds or when calculating the average RCs per ORF. To enable comparison and analysis of RCs of codons of the same type originating from different genes, RCs of each",

            "text": "coli and Bacteriophage Lambda expressed genes. The ribosome profiling method produces ribosome footprint counts that are proportional to the time spent in decoding each codon of all translated transcripts in a genome, at single nucleotide resolution. To avoid analyzing ribosomal profiles of genes with many missing read counts (RCs) that may result in a non-reliable estimation of the local ribosome density, genes profiles with fewer than 30 percent non-zero read counts were further filtered. Previous studies indicated an increase of RCs at the beginning of the ORF 4 and for some organisms at the end of ORF 4,5 ; therefore the first and last 20 codons were excluded when determining these thresholds or when calculating the average RCs per ORF. To enable comparison and analysis of RCs of codons of the same type originating from different genes, RCs of each codon were normalized by the average RCs of each gene; this normalization controls for possible different mRNA levels and initiation rates of different genes and has been performed in previous studies. To prevent biasing the average with codons containing less than one RC, those were excluded from the analysis (a similar procedure has been performed in a previous study5 ).The tRNA adaptation index (tAI)6 . Quantifies the adaptation of the codons of a coding region to the tRNA pool. Let tCGNij be the copy number of the j-th anti-codon that recognizes the i-th codon and let Si j be the selective constraint of the codon-anti-codon coupling efficiency. The S vector 6,7 [sI:U, sG:C, sU:A, sC:G, sG:U, sI:C, sI:A, sU:G, sL:A] was defined for E. coli as [in a previous study 7 . Then, the absolute adaptiveness value of a codon of type i to the tRNA pool is defined by: Let us mark the relative adaptiveness value of codon i with wi by normalizing each Wi with the maximal Wi value among the 61 Wi values (if the weight value is zero we use geometric mean of Wi). tAI is the geometric mean of wi over codons of a coding sequence.

For late genes, the correlation is significant only for the late time points. No significant correlation can be seen for early genes. The correlation between the Spearman correlation (y-axis) and the time condition (x-axis) are 0.9 for early genes (p = 0.083), -1 for late genes (p = 0.017 and 1 for E. coli genes (p = 0.017).",
