Extracellular effects of Trx1 require a functional active site, suggesting a redox-based mechanism of action. However, specific cell surface proteins and pathways coupling extracellular Trx1 redox activity to cellular responses have not been identified so far. Using a mechanism-based kinetic trapping technique to identify disulfide exchange interactions on the intact surface of living lymphocytes, we found that Trx1 catalytically interacts with a single principal target protein. This target protein was identified as the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 8 (TNFRSF8/CD30). We demonstrate that the redox interaction is highly specific for both Trx1 and CD30 and that the redox state of CD30 determines its ability to engage the cognate ligand and transduce signals. Furthermore, we confirm that Trx1 affects CD30dependent changes in lymphocyte effector function. Thus, we conclude that receptor-ligand signaling interactions can be selectively regulated by an extracellular redox catalyst.",

Consistent with this notion, various cell surface processes have long been known to depend on catalyzed thiol-disulfide exchange including cell adhesion (Essex, 2004) , uptake of bacterial toxins (de Paiva et al, 1993) and viral fusion with the host membrane (Sanders, 2000) . Moreover, a variety of cell surface signaling receptors appear to exist in more than one thiol-disulfide configuration, for example CD28 (Greene et al, 1996) .

            "text": "A number of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases are known to be secreted and to act on the cell surface. One of these redox catalysts is protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a member of the thioredoxin (Trx) superfamily. Cell surface-PDI has been found to act on transmembrane and surface-associated proteins, including the envelope protein of HIV-1, to cause its fusogenic conformation (Markovic et al, 2004) and integrins, to mediate platelet adhesion (Lahav et al, 2003) . Another thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase associated with extracellular functions is Trx1. Best known for its intracellular roles, Trx1 reduces transiently formed disulfide bonds of cytosolic and nuclear target proteins and thereby participates in a multitude of fundamental processes, ranging from oxidant scavenging and DNA synthesis to regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation (Powis and Montfort, 2001) . In addition, Trx1 is released to the extracellular environment by a variety of normal and neoplastic cells (Rubartelli et al, 1992) . Human Trx1 was first purified as a cytokine-like factor from supernatants of virally transformed lymphocytes and initially named adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor (Tagaya et al, 1988) , Tac-inducing factor (Tagaya et al, 1989) , B-cell stimulatory factor or 'B cell IL-1' (Wakasugi et al, 1990) . Extracellular Trx1 is present in the circulation of healthy subjects and its levels increase under inflammatory conditions, including viral infection (Nakamura et al, 2001a) . Circulatory Trx1 acts as a chemoattractant for monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes (Bertini et al, 1999) , and inhibits neutrophil migration into inflammatory sites both in vitro and in vivo (Nakamura et al, 2001b) . More recently, Trx1 was found to be secreted by dendritic cells upon cognate T-cell recognition and to contribute to subsequent T-cell activation (Angelini et al, 2002) .",

As many of its reported extracellular activities depend on a functional active site, it appears likely that Trx1 catalyzes thiol-disulfide exchange in one or more cell surface target proteins through its enzymatic activity. However, thiol-disulfide exchange reactions, even if highly specific, are too transient to be detected by conventional techniques. To date, only a single cell surface receptor, CD4, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been shown to be susceptible to Trx1 redox activity (Matthias et al, 2002) . Other cell surface proteins targeted by the enzymatic activity of Trx1 await identification.",

Using a kinetic trapping technique that enables the detection and isolation of otherwise short-lived reaction intermediates on the surface of intact cells, we identify and validate the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member CD30 (TNFRSF8) as the principal target molecule for Trx1 on infected and transformed lymphocytes. The cell surface activity of Trx1 is highly selective, discriminating between different members of the TNFR superfamily. Trx1-mediated thiol-disulfide exchange leads to a structural change in the CD30 ectodomain that can be detected with conformationsensitive antibodies. We demonstrate that disulfide exchange between Trx1 and CD30 interferes with binding of the CD30 ligand (CD30L) to its cognate receptor and that Trx1 affects CD30-dependent changes in lymphocyte effector function. As CD30 is implicated in both stimulatory and apoptotic signaling, our findings suggest that Trx1 interacts with CD30 to modulate lymphocyte behavior and survival under conditions of infection and inflammation.",

This approach makes use of the finding that mutant thiol-dependent oxidoreductases lacking the C-terminal cysteine of the CXXC active site motif form long-lived mixed disulfide intermediates with target proteins. Thus, target proteins remain covalently linked to the mutant oxidoreductase and become amenable to isolation and analysis (principle shown in Figure 1A ). Kinetic trapping has been applied previously to identify interaction partners of Trx family members in plants (Motohashi et al, 2001) and in the secretory pathway of human lymphocytes . In these studies, the CXXC-based trapping technique identified both established and novel target proteins, subsequently confirmed by independent techniques, demonstrating the competence of this technique to identify bona fide interaction partners.",

In accordance with the trapping mechanism, conjugation strictly depended on the availability of the N-terminal thiol (Cys-32) and the concurrent absence of the C-terminal thiol (Cys-35), as wild-type or cysteine-free Trx1 did not capture any proteins ( Figure 1C, lanes 3, 5 and 9 ).

Grx1, like Trx1, uses its active site thiol to act as a disulfide reductase in the cytosolic environment. However, in contrast to Trx1, Grx1 is specialized in the recognition and reduction of protein-glutathione mixed disulfide bonds and forms mixed disulfide intermediates with glutathione rather than with proteins (Yang et al, 1998; Peltoniemi et al, 2006) . As expected, we did not detect trapping of peroxiredoxins (or other Trx1-interacting proteins) by Grx1(CSAAA), neither on silver gels ( Figure 1E , lanes 3 and 4) nor by immunoblotting (data not shown). The activity and thiol reactivity of the Grx1 trapping mutant was confirmed in independent experiments (data not shown), thus demonstrating that the mere availability of an active site thiol does not explain the profile of proteins captured by the Trx1 trapping mutant.

The 160 kDa conjugate did not form on the surface of the EBV-negative Burkitts lymphoma cell line BL-41 ( Figure 2B ).

To exclude the possibility that Trx1 interacts with CRDs uniformly, we tested whether Trx1 discriminates between distinct members of the TNFR superfamily. As shown in Figure 4A , CD95 (TNFRSF6) did not form a mixed disulfide conjugate with Trx1(CSAAA) on the same cells under identical conditions. The same result was obtained for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which contains a total of 25 ectodomain disulfide bonds, and is expressed at substantial levels on A431 cells (Gill and Lazar, 1981 ) ( Figure 4B ). These findings indicate that Trx1 reactivity of cell surface receptors is selective and is not determined by the presence of CRDs or the number of ectodomain disulfide bonds. To further exclude that Trx1 reactivity of receptors is determined or limited by surface expression levels, we ectopically overexpressed CD30 or other TNFR superfamily members under control of the same promoter in HeLa cells and analyzed Trx1 cell surface trapping by indirect immunofluorescence. While mock-transfected HeLa cells did not capture Trx1(CSAAA) on their surface ( Figure 4C , lower row), expression of CD30 led to a strong Trx1 surface association and colocalization of both proteins ( Figure 4C , upper row). In contrast, expression of CD95 ( Figure 4D ), TNFR1 or NGFR (data not shown) did not promote Trx1 interactions with the cell surface, further strengthening the notion that Trx1 reactivity is a specific property of CD30. The domain structure of human CD30 differs from other members of the TNFR superfamily and from its murine homologue by the presence of two additional CRDs, arising from the internal duplication of two exons (Burgess et al, 2004) . We asked whether this unusual feature might confer Trx1 reactivity to human CD30 and tested whether the shorter murine CD30 could also interact with Trx1. As shown in Figure 4E , murine CD30 expressed on the Rauscher murine leukemia virus-induced T-cell lymphoma line RMA is efficiently targeted by Trx1(CSAAA), thus demonstrating that the additional CRDs in human CD30 are not required for Trx1 reactivity. The result also suggests that the enzymatic affinity of Trx1 for CD30 has been conserved during mammalian evolution.",

Cellular lysate was included as control. (C) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with an expression construct for human CD30 or empty vector incubated with Trx1(CSAAA) and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using CD30-and Trx1-specific antibodies (scale bar, 20 mm).

(E) RMA mouse lymphoma cells were incubated with Trx1(CSAAA) or Trx1(CCAAA). Disulfide-linked Trx1 complexes were analyzed by anti-mouse CD30 (mCD30) immunoblotting under non-reducing and reducing conditions. The disulfide-linked Trx1-mCD30 complex and monomeric mCD30 are indicated. The additional band of higher molecular weight has not been further characterized but might represent a conjugate between Trx1 and a dimer of mCD30. reduction in greater detail. Addition of oxidized Trx1 did not influence antibody reactivity of CD30 (data not shown). When reduced Trx1 was applied in the absence of a regenerating system, a conformational change in CD30 could be observed, but remained incomplete (data not shown). Complete and sustained loss of antibody reactivity required a source of reducing equivalents for the oxidoreductase. Both DTT and Trx reductase (TrxR)/NADPH were found to be effective as regenerating systems. Importantly, neither DTT nor TrxR/NADPH had an effect when applied in the absence of Trx1 ( Figure 5A , middle panel and data not shown). Wild-type Grx1 ( Figure 5C , left panel) and the redox-inactive mutant of Trx1 ( Figure 5C , middle panel) did not alter the redox-sensitive CD30 epitopes. Other cell surface receptors, for example CD28, analyzed in parallel on the same cells were unaffected by Trx1 treatment ( Figure 5C, right panel) . Loss of CD30 antibody recognition typically occurred within minutes ( Figure 5D , upper panel). Testing the influence of Trx1 concentration under the same conditions, consistent effects on CD30 conformation became evident at concentrations around 100 nM ( Figure 5D , lower panel).",

A brief incubation of CD30 \u00fe Hodgkin's lymphoma HDLM-2 cells with wild-type Trx1 led to a substantial loss in CD30L binding to the cell surface ( Figure 6A) . A similar result was obtained for the large granular lymphoma Figure S4) . The same effect was evident in the absence of an exogenously added reducing system (Supplementary Figure S5) , thus demonstrating that under the given conditions Trx1-substrate interactions are not limited by oxidative inactivation.

In particular, intracellular Trx1 counteracts oxidative stress, promotes cell growth and inhibits apoptosis. Under conditions of oxidative stress, Trx1 is released by cells and accumulates at sites of inflammation (Nordberg and Arner, 2001) . Numerous studies have reported that secretory Trx1 influences effector functions and proliferation of lymphocytes (Nakamura et al, 1997) . However, proteins and pathways coupling extracellular Trx1 redox activity to defined cellular responses have remained unknown. In this study, we addressed the question regarding which lymphocyte surface receptors are targeted and regulated by the redox activity of extracellular Trx1. For this purpose, we made use of a mechanism-based kinetic trapping approach to capture mixed disulfide intermediates formed between exogenous Trx1 and its target proteins on the cell surface of living cells. Activity-based techniques offer the opportunity to identify interactions too short-lived to be detectable by conventional methods. To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of kinetic trapping to identify novel target proteins of mammalian Trx1 and the first application of this technique to the surface of intact cells. We demonstrate that Trx1 interacts with intraand extracellular target proteins in a highly selective manner, guided by specific protein-protein recognition rather than random encounters with disulfide bonds.",

Although the CD30 ectodomain harbors a significant number of predicted disulfide bridges within CRDs, it does not appear to be unusual in terms of disulfide bond composition/density when compared to other members of the superfamily. When tested experimentally, Trx1 failed to interact with other CRD-containing proteins, including the EGFR featuring a total of 25 ectodomain disulfide bonds. The preference for CD30 could not be explained by exceptional surface expression levels either. While Hodgkin's disease cell lines typically express high levels of CD30, other cell lines including LCL-721.220 or CCRF-CEM show at least 20-to 100-fold lower expression as determined by flow cytometry, yet the same selective targeting was observed. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of several related TNFR superfamily members in HeLa cells did not lead to their interaction with Trx1, yet CD30 strongly interacted on the same cells under the same conditions. Consistent with these findings, recent experiments demonstrate that Trx1 targets a particular site within the CD30 ectodomain (Y Balmer and TP Dick, unpublished data) .",

Cells incubated with anti-polyHis antibody only were used as control. Unstained cells are shown in gray. (B) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with an expression construct for CD30 and either left untreated or treated with active (CCAAA) or inactive Trx1 (SSAAA) in the presence of DTT. After washing, cells were incubated with recombinant CD30L-His 10 . CD30L bound to the cell surface was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-CD30L antibody (scale bar, 20 mm).",

YT large granular lymphoma cells were left untreated or treated with active (CCAAA) or inactive Trx1 (SSAAA) in the presence of TrxR/NADPH as a regenerating system. After treatment, the change in CD30 redox state was verified by flow cytometry using antibody MAB229 (upper panel). Cells were then stimulated with agonistic anti-CD30 antibody (MAB229) or recombinant CD30L, or left unstimulated (column 3). After 24 h, cell surface expression of the IL-2Ra chain (CD25) was analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-CD25 antibody. As control, unstained cells and cells stained with 21 antibody only (columns 1 and 2) were used. (B) Trx1 inhibits CD30-mediated changes in effector function. YT cells were treated as described in (A). After 24 h, YT cells were harvested and analyzed for cytotoxicity on 51 Cr-labeled Raji cells (E:T ratio of 25:1). The experiment was performed in triplicates. Expression levels of FasL-mRNA were analyzed by RT-PCR. b-Actin levels are shown as control.",
