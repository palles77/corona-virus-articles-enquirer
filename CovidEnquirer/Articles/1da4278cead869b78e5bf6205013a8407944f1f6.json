            "text": "All purchased chemicals and solvents were of reagent or HPLC grade unless otherwise stated and were used directly as obtained from the manufacturer unless stated otherwise. Tetrahydrofuran was freshly distilled from sodium under an atmosphere of N2. LC-MS of intermediates was conducted on an Agilent HP1100 or HP1200 operating in positive mode. Chromatography was achieved on a Waters Sunfire C18 column (length 50 mm, diameter 4.6 mm, 3.5 \uf06dm). Solvent A was water (0.05% TFA) and solvent B was acetonitrile (0.05% TFA). LC method: T = 0 min; 1% B; T = 1.7 min, 99% B; T = 2.6 min, 99% B; T = 2.7 min, 1% B. NMR of intermediates was recorded on a Bruker Avance500 spectrometer at 500 MHz ( 1 H NMR). NMR of final products were acquired on a Bruker Avance500 spectrometer fitted with a 5 mm triple resonance inverse automatic tuning and matching (TCI ATM) cryoprobe with Z gradients running at 298 K and operating at 500 MHz and126 MHz for 1 H and 13 C, respectively. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million and are referenced relative to the solvent resonance. Coupling constants are given in hertz. LC-MS of final products was recorded on an integrated Agilent HP1100 HPLC system in combination with a Bruker Daltonics Esquire 3000+ spectrometer fitted with an electrospray source. LC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent HP1100 equipped with a Gemini NX C18 110 \u00c5 column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 3 \u03bcm, Phenomenex) heated to 40 \u00b0C. The gradient elution was from 10 % B held for 2 min followed by a linear increase to 100% mobile phase B over 13 min and held at 100% B for a further 2 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Mobile phase A was water containing 0.1% formic acid; mobile phase B was acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. The HPLC system described above was coupled to a Bruker Daltonics Esquire 3000+ electrospray mass spectrometer, scanning from 50 to 1500 amu in switching mode. High-resolution MS were measured on a Bruker BioApex II 4.7e Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance spectrometer fitted with an electrospray source and operating in positive ion mode. Final compounds were shown to be greater than 95% pure by NMR and the LC-MS method described above on two solid phases (C18 and phenyl-hexyl). The major confirmer of each sangamide was elucidated using HRMS and 1D and 2D NMR experiments ( 1 H, 13 C, APT, COSY, HMBC and HMQC).",

A single colony was used to prepare an overnight culture of this strain in 3ml 2TY apramycin (50 \u00b5g/ml) and tetracycline (3 \u00b5g/ml) at 30 \u00b0C. 0.5 ml of this culture was used to inoculate 10 ml 2TY apramycin (50 \u00b5g/ml) and tetracycline (3 \u00b5g/ml) at 30 \u00b0C and grown to an OD 600nm ~0.5. 1.4 ml of this culture was transferred to each of two Eppendorf tubes and 50 \u00b5l 10 % arabinose added to one tube to induce expression of the Red/ET recombination proteins. Tubes were shaken for ~1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Induced and non-induced cells were pelleted in a bench top centrifuge and washed twice with chilled sterile water; resuspending and centrifuging to pellet the cells each time. The resulting pellets were suspended in about 30-40 \u00b5l of water and kept on ice. The 1.7 kb disruption fragment isolated previously was added to the induced and non-induced tubes and transferred to 1mm Biorad electrocuvettes on ice. The samples were electroporated (Biorad Micropulser at 1.8kV, resulting time constant ~4ms) and 1 ml 2TY (no antibiotics) added and mixed to remove the cells from the cuvette. Cells were incubated for ~3 h at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (1100rpm, Eppendorf thermomixer compact) before plating onto 2TY plates containing apramycin (50 \u00b5g/ml and kanamycin 25 \u00b5g/ml and incubating over night at 37 \u00b0C. Colonies from the induced sample plates were streaked onto 2TY plates containing kanamycin at 50 \u00b5g/ml to purify and confirm introduction of the kanamycin resistance cassette. PCR on individual bacterial colonies was used to confirm the introduction of the cassette. Plasmids were prepared from these cultures and digested to confirm the expected plasmid pSGK270. Plasmids were then digested with NsiI to remove the marker fragment, and the remainder religated to produce the sfaA in-frame deletion construct pSGK271.",

This material (278 mg) was dissolved in methanol (1.8 ml) and purified by preparative HPLC. A Waters Xterra MSC18 column (10 micron, 19 cm x 250 mm) was used with solvent pumped at 21 mL/min. Solvent A was water and solvent B was acetonitrile. The column was eluted isocratically at 50 % B for 6 min following the injection followed by a linear gradient to 100 % B at 30 min. Pure fractions were identified by HPLC-UV and combined. These fractions were taken to dryness under reduced pressure to yield BC457 as an off-white amorphous solid (20 mg).",

Cells were then incubated with pH 7.4 buffer in both apical and basolateral compartments for 40 min at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with a relative humidity of 95 % to stabilize physiological parameters. For the apical to basolateral study (A-B), buffer at pH 7.4 was removed from the apical compartment and replaced with loperamide dosing solutions before being placed in the 'companion' plates. The solutions were prepared by diluting loperamide in DMSO with buffer to give a final loperamide concentration of 5 \u03bcM (final DMSO concentration adjusted to 1 %). The fluorescent integrity marker Lucifer yellow was also included in the dosing solution. The experiment was performed in the presence and absence of the test compound (applied to both the apical and basolateral compartments). For basolateral to apical (B-A) study, the P-glycoprotein substrate, loperamide (final concentration = 5 \u03bcM) was placed in the basolateral compartment.

Incubations were carried out in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 with a relative humidity of 95% at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min. After the incubation period, the companion plate was removed and apical and basolateral samples diluted for analysis by LC-MS/MS. A single determination of each test compound concentration was performed. On each plate, a positive control inhibitor was also screened. The test compound was assessed at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 and 50 \u03bcM. The integrity of the monolayers throughout the experiment was checked by monitoring Lucifer yellow permeation using fluorimetric analysis.
