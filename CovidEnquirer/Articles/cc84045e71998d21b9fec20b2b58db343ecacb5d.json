            "text": "In commercial poultry production there are a number of diseases which are of particular importance due to the heavy economic losses that can arise if a flock becomes infected. The development of an automated and rapid disease detection system would therefore be of considerable benefit to both production and animal welfare. This study represents an intelligence device for diagnosing avian diseases by using Data-mining methods and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (D-S). 14-day-old chickens were divided into four groups. Each group was deliberately infected with a disease: Newcastle Disease (ND), Bronchitis Virus (BV), Avian Influenenza (AI), and the last group was considered as control samples. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) were used to process the chicken's sound signals in frequency and time-frequency domains, respectively. In order to achieve information, 25 statistical features from frequency domains, and 75 statistical features from time-frequency domains were extracted. During dimensionality reduction stage, the best features of the sound signals were selected, using improved distance evaluation (IDE) method. The chicken's sound signals were analyzed in two consecutive days after virus infection. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as the classifier in this study. The first classification was done with SVM and based on sound features in frequency and time-frequency domains with accuracy of 41.35 and 83.33%, respectively. The accuracy of the method based on D-S infusion of sound data reached 91.15%. The developed model based on achievement result could diagnose Newcastle Disease, Bronchitis Virus and Avian Influenza from sound signals.",

It is characterized by respiratory and nervous signs, bleeding lesions in the digestive system and mild infections in the respiratory system. Newcastle Disease is a single-stranded RNA virus that threatens poultry health and causes great economic losses (Nidzworski et al., 2013) . Newcastle Disease causes a very fatal disease in chickens classified under a single avian paramyxo virus serotype 1 (APMV-1). NDV shows a spectrum of virulence, with strains in NDV, causing infection (lentogenic strains). It shows moderate virulence (mesogenic strains), and exhibits very high virulence (velogenic strains), and the velogenic strains cause 100% mortality (Alexander, 2001; Capua and Alexander, 2009 ).",

(2009) designed an automated system to detect and classify calls of nine frogs and three bird species (Acevedo et al., 2009) . Gutierrez et al. (2010) classified porcine wasting diseases of pigs using sound analysis and labeling method. Pig's cough were recorded by microphone and the sound's feature like intensity, duration and pitch were extracted. They could detect and classify circovirus type 2 (PVC2), porcine reproductive, respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus, and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MH) diseases using sound's pitch-and-intensity analysis. Furthermore, cough duration was excluded because it couldn't find statistical difference between treatments (Gutierrez et al., 2010) . Kasten et al. (2010) classified the bird species based on bird sound. Different feature functions of the signals were extracted to classify the bird sounds. They found that bird gender and species can be identified based on their sounds (Kasten et al., 2010) . Lee et al. (2015) detected pig-wasting disease by using support vector machine (SVM) and acoustic features. In their research, 60 statistical parameters were extracted as signal indexes and the best features (RMS, Max Pitch, PSD, Peak frequency) were selected by using acoustic feature subset selection algorithm (AFSSA) method, which were used as inputs of the classifier (Lee et al., 2015) . Since it is possible to detect sound signal features, different types of analyses can be performed. Analysis of chicken's vocalization is a powerful tool to study about animal behavior and welfare (Exadaktylos et al., 2014) . Numerous factors such as diseases, weakness and species can change bird-generated sound signals. Sadeghi et al. (2015) designed an intelligent procedure for detecting chickens infected by Clostridium perfringens based on their vocalization. Chicken's vocalization was analyzed in time domain, and 25 statistical features were extracted from sound signals and the best features were selected using FDA method to be ANN's input data (Sadeghi et al., 2015) .",

One builds a multiclass SVM by combining several 2-class SVMs, including one-against-one (OAO) and one-against-all (OAA). The third method considers all classes at once, called all-together. A good review of SVM and its equations has been presented by (Widodo and Yang, 2007) . In the present study, OAO multiclass method was used to make multiclass SVM.

Maximum Sensitivity of the D-S evidence theory was obtained based on AI among other diseases and it can be inferred that detection of AI based on chicken's sound signals was much easier than ND and BV. Since the Sensitivity of D-S to detect the healthy, ND, BV and AI was obtained 95.8, 88.5, 88 and 92.3%, respectively, it can be said that sound of the infected chickens have completely affected by the viruses. pig wasting disease by using SVM and acoustic features with 98.4% accuracy (Lee et al., 2015) .

In the next step, 5 features, which were selected in feature selection part, will be extracted from the sound signal in frequency and time-frequency domains. Sequentially, the classes of the sound were determined by using SVM and finally, the outputs of SVM in frequency and time-frequency were combined by using D-S evidence theory.",

For further application of this method, other common diseases also should be evaluated and the method needs to be tested in farm condition which may have different noises.
