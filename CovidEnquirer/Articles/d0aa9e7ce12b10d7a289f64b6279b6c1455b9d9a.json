At 12.7\u00c015.7 kb, their genomes are considerably smaller than the coronaviruses but they share many characteristics with them, including overall genome organization and use of discontinuous transcription to synthesize subgenomic RNAs ( Fig. 18 .2). They lack the notable spike proteins of the coronaviruses. Members of the family include equine arteritis virus (EAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus of mice, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). In the late 1987 PRRSV emerged as a serious pathogen of domesticated pigs in the United States; it is now found worldwide and some strains are quite virulent.",

The B13\u00c016 kb positive-strand RNA genome contains 10\u00c013 open-reading frames (ORFs). Approximately three-fourths of the genome encodes the nonstructural proteins (nsp) required for transcription and genome replication. The nsp are encoded by two overlapping ORFs. ORF1a contains three to four protease domains and three transmembrane domains. The size of ORF1a is quite variable; for example, PRRSV ORF1a is B800 bases longer than EAV ORF1a. ORF1b is much more conserved among the arteriviruses. It is expressed by a ribosomal frameshift and encodes the RdRp, a helicase, and the NendoU endoribonuclease. Arterivirus NendoU is related to the coronavirus protein of the same name and hydrolyzes single-and double-stranded RNA. The exact role of NendoU in the arterivirus replication cycle remains unknown.",

Many infections are asymptomatic or cause mild upper respiratory tract disease; however, some infections are more severe. An infrequent outcome of infection is abortion in pregnant mares. Some infected stallions become persistent shedders of virus but can be cured of the infection by castration. This indicates a hormonal link (testosterone) to viral persistence although the molecular events associated with persistence have not been determined. During acute infection virus is transmitted via aerosols and the primary sites of replication are in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract.

Reproductive disease causes increased numbers of stillborn piglets, mummified fetuses, premature births, and weak piglets. Reproductive problems arise because PRRS can cross the placenta. If the virus crosses the placenta in the third trimester of gestation piglets may be viremic when born, and may transmit virus for 2\u00c03 months. The respiratory form of the disease affects piglets, causing pneumonia and respiratory distress. Pneumonia develops because the virus infects alveolar macrophage and the infection is cytopathic. PRRSV may also predispose pigs to secondary infections due to widespread destruction of macrophages. The emergence of PRRSV has resulted in the need for increased biosecurity on pig farms. To avoid introducing the virus into a herd, farmers use strict quarantine measures when introducing new animals. They must also purchase breeding stock and semen that is known to be virus-free. Sanitation of transport vehicles and strict protocols of fomite and personnel movement between farms are also critical components of an effective program.",

The disease was clinically similar to human hemorrhagic fevers and the mortality was quite high, approaching 100%. Macrophages are the primary target for SHFV and cytolytic infection is probably related to viral pathogenesis. It was long suspected that the natural hosts for SHFV were African monkeys. Recent studies have revealed that in fact many species of wild African monkeys are persistently infected with arteriviruses related to SHFV. However there is a great deal of genetic diversity with viruses from different monkey species sharing only about 50% nucleotide sequence identity. In some areas, up to 40% of monkeys are persistently infected and virus titers in the blood are quite high. Thus it appears that many monkey arteriviruses are quite well adapted to their natural hosts but have the potential to cause severe disease if transmitted to another species.",
