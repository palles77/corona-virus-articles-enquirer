            "text": "Demyelinating disorders of the human central nervous system (CNS), principally multiple sclerosis (MS) but also postinfectious encephalomyelitis, commonly result in profound neurologic dysfunction. These diseases seem to involve primarily cell-mediated immune mechanisms and probably have an initiating environmental factor-that is, a virus. This relationship clearly exists for postinfectious encephalomyelitis and, on the basis of epidemiologic investigations, is also likely for MS.I Evidence from studies of twins indicates that environmental and genetic susceptibility factors are important in MS.2 Murine Models of CNS Demyelination.-Two murine models of CNS demyelination-experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis-provide opportunities for investigating autoimmune and virus-associated disease, respectively. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis is of considerable interest both as an autoimmune disease of the CNS and as a model of immunotherapy for CNS demyelinating diseases. A myelin basic protein-specific, CD4+ T-cell population is required for initiation of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. MS and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis have the following common features: CNS demyelination, perivascular CD4+ T cells, association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens, and restricted T-cell receptor variable-gene segment utilization.' The murine adoptive transfer model in the SJUJ mouse has another important feature of MS-the chronic relapsing clinical course.' This recurrent course is ideal for manipulating the immune response not only during induction and onset of disease but also during relapse. The pathologic findings are characterized by inflammation and prominent demyelination.' This autoimmune disease, however, is not associated with an environmental factor.",

            "text": "Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is an important model of immune-mediated demyelination because it has parallels with postinfectious encephalomyelitis and MS. In this model, a mild or even subclinical viral encephalitis is followed by a 4-week period of quiescence and then the onset of demyelination. The demyelination in the TMEV model is mediated by viral-specific T lymphocytes. During the demyelinating phase of the disease, however, the virus is persistent; this finding implicates either a low-level expression of viral polypeptides or an immunologic cross-reactivity between virus and myelin antigen (or antigens). As in MS and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, T cells seem to initiate immune-mediated demyelination in TMEV. 4 In this issue of the Mayo Clinic Proceedings (pages 829 to 838), Lindsley and associates describe the association of viral and MHC class I antigen expression in areas of demyelination induced by TMEV infection. The observation that these molecules are coexpressed in the white matter of the spinal cord in susceptible mice but not in resistant mice is a major contribution to the understanding of this fascinating animal model of CNS demyelination. Interestingly, only a few glial cells in the spinal cords were infected, and many more cells expressed MHC class I antigen only. This result may be attributed to the secretion of cytokines within the CNS by lymphocytes or endothelial cells or even glial-induced \"upregulation\" of MHC class I molecules.",

The results of recent investigative studies of TMEV infection in mice deficient in~2-microglobulin and therefore deficient in MHC class I antigen demonstrate striking demyelination and implicate the class l-restricted immune response,\" Therefore, the CD8+ T lymphocytes are important for limiting infection and both potentiating and inhibiting demyelination.

In fact, CD4+ encephalitogenic cells that are class II restricted have cytotoxic MHC class II-restricted activity in vitro.'? The TMEV-induced demyelination studies with anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated that if the CD4+ subset is depleted before infection, the result is mortality due to the initial infection.\" Alternatively, if anti-CD4+ monoclonal antibody is administered after the initial infection, the clinical manifestations of demyelination are decreased/ Current evidence suggests that, in TMEV, the Tcell response to viral polypeptides is readily observed and that reactivity to myelin antigens is rare or nonexistent. 11 An intriguing study has substantiated that a virus (VP2)-specific CD4+ T-cell line can adoptively augment the TMEV-induced demyelination.\" These findings may be consistent with a recent model of CD4 T-cell subtypes.",

Different mechanisms of demyelination depend on the virus involved. Persistent virus in glial cells can provide target cells for a cytotoxic process in the white matter.

Among laboratories, no consensus exists about the restriction or heterogeneity of T cells responding to myelin basic protein. A potential linkage or association of MS with genes of the immune system is the focus of recent investigation. The evidence for an environmental cause is compelling.I Most likely, this factor would be exposure to either an infectious agent such as a virus or a pathogen that produces a superantigen capable of activating T cells.'?
