Several cell types have been identified in colostrum and milk, including both T and B lymphocytes, macro-phages and neutrophils (Smith & Goldman, 1968 ). In addition, other cells, such as eosinophils, are present in small numbers and also cells, frequently binucleate with foaming cytoplasm, which have not yet been positively identified but which are probably of epithelial origin (Hollman, 1974) .",

(Michalek et al., 1976) and mice (Roux et al., 1977) and these last authors demonstrated that the link between the gut and the mammary gland is indeed mediated by lymphocytes moving from the gut and lodging in mammary tissue. It is these lymphocytes originating in the gut which are seen to accumulate within the mammary gland in the final stages of gestation. This process continues throughout lactation since Evans et al.

Since it is the major immunoglobulin in milk it does not suffer the great fall in concentration seen in both IgG and IgM during the transition from colostrum to milk and IgA antibody titres will be higher and more persistent . In addition, IgA is more resistant to the proteolytic activity of enzymes than are IgM and IgG (Underdown & Dorrington, 1974) and will therefore persist longer in the hostile environment of the intestine. It has also been shown that complement fixing antibody can cause damage at mucosal surfaces (Brandtzaeg & Tolo, 1977) and it has been suggested that IgA, which can mediate few biological functions through its Fc region and, in particular, probably cannot fix complement (Colton & Bienenstock, 1974) may not cause such damaging effects (Ferguson, 1977) Finally~ IgA has been shown to be closely associated with the villous and crypt epithelium of the sucking rat (Nagura et al., 1978) and pig (Butler et al., 1981) which would greatly enhance the efficiency with which it could protect the mucosa.",

Kohler et al. (1975) In addition to protection against infectious disease, there is much evidence in man that breast feeding may protect against the development of allergy. Breast fed infants born to allergic parents have a lower incidence of atopic disease than bottle fed babies born to similar famil~es (Matthew et al., 1977; Saarinen et al., 1979) . Since a period of transient IgA deficiency during the first three months of life commonly precedes the development of allergic disease (Taylor et al., 1973) it is possible that increased absorption of cows milk proteins by bottle fed babies as the result of defective immune exclusion (Stokes et al., 1975 ) may lead to subsequent disease. An alternative explanation may be found in the altered gut flora established in babies fed cows' milk where E. coli predominates (Bullen & Willis, 1971) , and it is possible that absorption of adjuventising endotoxin during the IgA deficient phase may lead to sensitisation. Immune exclusion, the blocking of the passage of antigen across mucous membranes by antibody, is not, however, an absolute phenomena (Swarbrick et al., 1979) and the protection from the development of damaging hypersensitivity reaction results at least in part from the development of oral tolerance (Bazin & Platteau, 1977) . Factors associated with breast milk feeding that may influence this have not been characterised, but the observation that feeding B-cell mitogen enhances the development of orally induced tolerance to contact sensitising agents (Newby et al., 1980a) and the alteration of immune responsiveness observed during periods of dietary change (Newby et al., 1980b) suggests possible mechanisms.",

Further suggestive evidence for the absorption of lymphocytes comes from the demonstration of prolonged allograft survival on rats nursed on allogenic foster mothers (Beer et al., 1974 Beer, 1978) . A physiological role for these absorbed cells has also been suggested. Mohr (1973) reported positive tuberculin skin tests in children who had been breast fed by tuberculin-positive mothers. Subsequent studies have shown an absence of tuberculin-reactive lymphocytes in cord blood, but their presence in colostrum and early milk of women with tuberculin-reactive peripheral blood T cells (Schlesinger & Covelli, 19777 Ogra et al., 1977) . The absence of tuberculin sensitivity in non-breast fed babies of tuberculin positive mothers provides further support that milk is the medium of transfer",

In addition this approach could have important prophylactic uses in controlling disease in calves, and also, through the use of immune milk as a basis for formula baby feeds, in man. Although the immunisation regimes described so far can result in the appearance of antibody in mammary secretions~ it is clear that they do not represent the normal method of antigenic stimulation. The first investigation to shed light upon this subject was that by Bohl et al. (1972) who showed that IgA antibody to TGE virus appeared in milk following the infection of the gut of the sow with the virus. They postulated that there was a link between the gut and the mammary gland in the sow such that antigenic stimulation within the intestine lead to an IgA response in the mammary gland, and since this IgA is locally synthesised it must be mediated by the traffic of primed lymphocytes from the gut to the mammary gland. These early observations have since been confirmed and extended in the sow (Bohl & Sail, 1975 I Hess et al.,",

They found that the antibody response to the virus in milk was confined to the IgG class.Although the migration of sensltised lymphocytes from the gut to many mucosal sites has been demonstrated (Weisz-Carrington et al.,1979), until the immunisation of a distant site can be shown tolead to an IgA response in milk, the gut-mammary link must be considered as in some way unique.How far this gut-mammary lymphocyte traffic operates in ruminants is far from clear. In the absence of intramammary infusion there is little evidence of local antibody synthesis in bovine milk(Newby & Bourne, 1977) but plasma cells'do accumulate in la[e gestation and some colostral IgA and IgM is locally produced.",

Firstly, colostrum absorbed into the circulation of the neonatal animal provides passive circulating antibody which prevents the invasion of micro-organisms into the circulation, secondly, milk, which is not absorbed and hence acts only within the alimentary tract, provides a passive local immunity which can protect against enteric disease. This distinction between the two functions is demonstrated very clearly in the effect of colostrum on the susceptibility of calves to the enteric and septicaemic forms of neonatal E. coli infection. Many studies have shown that calves lacking adequate passive serum antibody have an increased susceptibility to the septicaemic form of coli bacillosis (Gay et al., 1965 I Smith et al.~ 19677 McEwan et al., 1970) but passive serum antibody concentrations which protect against septicaemia do not reduce the susceptibility of weaned calves to the enteric form of the infection(Penhale et al., 1970).Similarly, Logan andPenhale (1970a,b)  andPenhale and Logan (1971) could induce immunity to the septicaemic form of colibacillosis by the intravenous administration of colostral antibody~ but this did not protect the calf from the enteric form. Following gut closure in the calf, when colostral antibody can no longer be absorbed, however, the continual feeding of colostrum can protect against the enteric form of the disease(Logan et al., 1974)  and",

This antibody declined very rapidly during the first few days of lactation and was present in milk at very low levels. Studies have also been performed in sheep (Wells et al.~ %978) with very similar results. A slightly different approach has been made byChidlow and Porter (1978)  who showed that parenteral immunisation could~ by using appropriate immunisation regimes~ lead to high serum levels of IgG or IgM antibody. This appeared in high concentrations in colostrum but again fell to much lower levels in milk.Although in general systemic immunisation leads to systemicrather than local antibody, under certain circumstances secretory antibody may also be stimulated. The most interesting instance of this is the observation bySvennerholm et al. (1977) that in women already primed by previous exposure to vibrio cholera infection, parenteral immunisation boosted secretory antibody titres. However, most investigations have concluded that systemic antibody is an inefficient way of stimulating milk antibody (Bourne et al.,",

The subsequent wasting syndrome with symptoms typical of GvH that occurred in these suckling rats is evidence that this disease was caused by the absorption of allogenic milk lymphocytes.

Neutrophils isolated from mammary glands stimulated with a staphylococcal culture filtrate have been shown to kill serum resistant strains of E. coli, apparently in the absence of serum derived opsonisation factors(Hill et al., 1978).Infusion of serum resistant E. coli into a single mammary gland led to a rapid increase in the milk leukocyte count and removal from the gland of all viable bacteria.Subsequently these authors have shown that recovery from infection is related not to the number of invading organisms but to the animal's ability to mobi!ise neutrophils into infected glands and on the ability of those cells to kill the infecting organism.The immune effects of passively transferred maternal colostral antibody have been variously reported to be either suppressive or enhancing dependent both on the species and experimental system studied.Antigen specific inhibition of immune responsiveness has been demonstrated in pigs.Hoerlien (1957)  showed that whilst the immune responsiveness to a variety of antigens wasd]minished if colostrum was withheld, feeding colostrum from sows immunised with Brucella abortus suppressed the piglet's primary immune response to that antigen.",
