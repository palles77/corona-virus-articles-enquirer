Attitudes toward suicide among medical staff members have been associated with appropriate therapeutic responses to suicidal individuals. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of parental rearing on attitudes toward suicide among Japanese medical college students. Methods: We examined the association between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide in 160 medical college students in Japan. The Parental Bonding Instrument was used to assess the attitudes and behaviors of parents. The attitudes toward suicide were evaluated using the Japanese version of the Attitudes Toward Suicide questionnaire. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 25.2\u00b14.0 years old. The majority of the participants in our study agreed that anyone could commit suicide (88.8%) and that suicide is preventable (86.3%). After adjusting for age and sex, multivariate regression analysis revealed that maternal care approached a statistically significant association with the \"right to suicide\" attitude. Under the same conditions, maternal care was shown to be significantly associated with the \"common occurrence\" attitude. No other significant relationships were observed between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide.",

Among medical staff members, negative attitudes toward suicide such as anger could affect nontherapeutic reactions to suicidal individuals. 4 Furthermore, a belief that suicide is a personal right was negatively related to suicide intervention skills. 5 An accurate assessment of the attitudes toward suicide held by medical staff members is relevant. Previous studies have shown that difficulties with parental bonding during childhood could be a predisposing factor for the onset of many psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety, depressive states, and maladjusted behaviors. [6] [7] [8] Parental bonding and premorbid personality traits play an important role in shaping the developmental trajectory of an individual, including his/her ability to adjust to stressful events. Although few studies have assessed the relationship between parental bonding and mental conditions among medical staff members, 9, 10 no study has evaluated the association between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide.",

In past years, suicide was regarded as an honorable solution to personal guilt and failure. Regarding occupational differences in attitudes toward suicide, Onc\u00fc et al found that medical students and general practitioners held the most permissive attitudes in Turkey. 18 In addition, they showed that the attitude scores of general practitioners regarding their preparedness to prevent suicide were lower compared to those of other groups. In Japan, Kodaka et al reported attitudes toward suicide among pharmacists using the ATTS. 13 More than half of pharmacists reported that people understand the wishes of others to commit suicide, and 16.8% of the participants thought that people who mention suicide do not actually take their own lives.",

Previous studies of parental bonding among medical staff members supported our results. A 10 year follow-up study of Norwegian physicians (n=631) revealed that a low level of maternal care predicted severe depressive symptoms and partially mediated low self-esteem. 9 Lung et al assessed the psychological effects on 127 health care workers who had cared for suspected Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) patients. Early maternal attachment and neuroticism were found to heavily affect mental health during life-threatening stress. 10 Distinct patterns of parental bonding may contribute to the development of different dysfunctional schemas which may influence attitudes toward suicide. 19 There are several limitations in this study. First, we used PBI to assess the child rearing behavior experienced by our participants. Although PBI has shown basic reliability for long periods, 20 we could not completely rule out possible influences of the current mood state or recall bias in individuals because PBI is an instrument for measuring recalled parental behaviors. Second, certain parameters were not assessed in this study personality traits, a history of psychiatric disorders, suicidal behavior, and current mood state could affect the attitude towards suicidal behavior. Third, because the participants in our study are medical students, we cannot generalize these results to general practitioners.",
