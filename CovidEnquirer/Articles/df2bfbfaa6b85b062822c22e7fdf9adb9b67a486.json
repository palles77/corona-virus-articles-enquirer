            "text": "Human and livestock encroachment into natural transmission cycles is the most common means of exposure to arboviral infections. This virus transmission scenario is sometimes termed 'spillover' because the principal enzootic vector(s) has a wide host feeding range not limited to the natural, amplifying, vertebrate hosts. Arboviruses in this category of transmission include, but are not limited to, West Nile, sylvan Yellow fever, Western equine encephalitis and La Crosse viruses. African swine fever virus is maintained in sub-Saharan Africa in a cycle involving Ornithodoros ticks and warthogs. Infected ticks infesting warthog burrows can also transmit the virus to their progeny by transovarial transmission. Infected warthogs do not show signs of the disease; however, domestic swine are severely affected with mortality rates approaching 100%. In addition to tick bite, transmission between domestic pigs can occur through direct contact and the ingestion of infected offal.",

For example, Rift Valley fever virus circulates in extensive areas of Africa and is transmitted by certain species of Aedes and Culex mosquitoes to various native vertebrates. The virus is thus maintained by horizontal transmission in the vertebrates and by transovarial and/or vertical transmission of the virus in mosquito eggs during periods of drought. El Nino events can lead to sustained rainfall and flooding, resulting in the production of massive numbers of other species of Aedes and Culex mosquitoes that enter into the existing, endemic transmission cycle. Infected vectors disperse and bloodfeed on livestock, initiating a secondary amplification cycle. Viremic livestock become the source for a dramatic increase in the numbers of infected vectors, which in turn engenders human epidemics and livestock epizootics.",

Arboviruses maintained in human!vector!human cycles are generally transmitted by domestic mosquito vectors, most importantly, Aedes aegypti. The dengue viruses, the most important arboviruses in terms of human disease, are the classic example of an arbovirus that has adapted to the human host. Other examples include Chikungunya and Yellow fever viruses which can cause spectacular outbreaks in areas infested with Aedes aegypti vectors. These latter viruses generally disappear after a sufficient numbers of humans become immune, but persist in sylvan transmission cycles until nonimmune human hosts become available or when human herd immunity wanes.",

In 1996, following the sequence analysis of their genomes, EAV, LDV, SHFV, and PRRSV were classified as species within a new family, Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus. EAV was designated the prototype of this family. At the same time, the family Arteriviridae was classified together with the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. This order also includes two additional virus groups, the toroviruses (a genus in the Coronaviridae family) and the family Roniviridae. The arterivirus genome shares similar general organizational features and conserved replicase motifs with corona-, toro-, and ronivirus genomes, but is only about half their size.

The double-labeling for nsp3 and the N protein shows that a considerable part of the latter co-localizes with the viral replication complex, whereas another fraction of the N protein is targeted to the nucleus. Early in infection, double-labeling for the major glycoprotein GP 5 and the M protein showed almost complete co-localization of the two proteins in the Golgi complex, in the form of the heterodimer that has been found to be critical for virus assembly. Later in infection, the M protein accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum. Scale \u00bc 50 nm (a, c-d virions undergo distortion and disintegration during standard negative staining procedures.

The EAV papain-like cysteine proteases each cleave at a single site. The nsp4 serine protease, or main protease, cleaves at six sites in the pp1a region and at three additional sites in the ORF 1b-encoded part of pp1ab.

Both replication (top panel) and transcription (bottom panel) are depicted. In the 'replication mode', the RdRp produced a full-length minus-strand RNA (antigenome) that serves as the template for synthesis of new genomic RNA. In the 'transcription mode', minus-strand RNA synthesis is thought to be discontinuous and regulated by transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs). Body TRSs (B) in the genome would act as attenuators of minus-strand RNA synthesis. Subsequently, the nascent minus strand, with an anti-body TRS at its 3 0 end, would be redirected to the 5 0 -proximal region of the genomic template by a base-pairing interaction with the leader TRS (L) that (for EAV) has been shown to reside in a leader TRS hairpin (LTH) structure. Following the addition of the anti-leader to the nascent minus strands, the sg-length minus strands would then serve as templates for sg mRNA synthesis. 20 kDa in size and are minor envelope glycoproteins (EAV, Figure 2 ).

Phylogenetic analysis of the arteriviruses indicated that PRRSV is most closely related to LDV and that SHFV is more closely related to both of these viruses than to EAV. Although the host specificity of LDV has experimentally been shown to be restricted to mouse species, it has been postulated that PRRSV arose when wild boars became infected with LDV after they ate infected wild mice and that wild boars then introduced a divergent 'LDV' virus into domestic pigs independently in North America and Europe.",

The ancestral nidovirus has been postulated to have had an icosahedral capsid.

However, transmission of LDV from mother to the fetus via the placenta and to pups via breast milk/saliva has been documented within the first week after infection of the mother. Since LDV in mice and SHFV in patas monkeys is produced throughout the lifetime of persistently infected animals, the transfer of fluids or tissues from an infected animal to an uninfected one results in the inadvertent transfer of infection. Historically the most frequent mode of transmission of LDVamong laboratory mice and SHFV from patas monkeys to macaques has been through experimental procedures such as the use of the same needle for sequential inoculation of several animals. Currently, the most frequent sources of LDV contamination are pools of other infectious agents or tumor cell lines that have been repeatedly passaged in mice, especially those first isolated in the 1950s. Such materials should be checked for the presence of LDV. Infectious agent stocks can be 'cured' of LDV by passage in a continuous cell line or a different animal species. Tumor cell stocks can be 'cured' by in vitro culture for several passages. It has been suggested but not proven that SHFV can be transmitted between macaques via the respiratory route.",

Although there are five naturally occurring LDH isozymes in mouse plasma, only the level of isozyme LDVV is elevated in LDV-infected mice. Studies have indicated that the increase in enzyme levels is primarily the result of a decreased rate of enzyme clearance. A subpopulation of Kupffer cells involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDH is severely diminished in mice by 24 h after LDV infection. It has been postulated that LDV replication in these cells causes their death and results in increased LDH serum levels. Splenomegaly, characterized by a greater than 30% increase in spleen weight, occurs in about 40% of the mice infected with LDV. The increase in spleen weight is observed by 24 h after infection and persists for up to a month. A marked necrosis of lymphocytes in thymicdependent areas occurs during the first 4 days after LDV infection together with a transient decrease in the number of circulating T lymphocytes between 24 and 72 h after infection.

Despite the lifelong presence of circulating viral immune complexes and the demonstration of some LDV antibody deposits in the kidneys of LDV-infected mice as early as 7 days after infection, these animals do not develop kidney disease. It has been suggested that nephritis does not develop in these chronically infected mice because of the inability of the majority of the LDV-antibody complexes to bind C1q. Low levels of C1q-binding activity can only be detected between days 10 and 18 after LDV infection. LDV infection can alter the outcome of concomitant autoimmune disease, probably through modulation of the host-immune responses.

A vigorous antiviral antibody response can be detected by ELISA beginning 7-9 days after infection but these antibodies have little neutralizing activity. Beginning at about a month after infection, neutralizing antibody can be detected and peaks between 1 and 2 months after infection. Viremia is reduced to very low levels but virus continues to be produced from infected cells in tissues for at least 5 months. Usually, the infection eventually is completely cleared, but in some cases it continues to persist.",

The production of this antibody is dependent on functional T helper cells. Plasma from LDV-infected mice has a much higher nonspecific binding activity than plasma from uninfected mice; virusspecific binding measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) usually cannot be detected until the plasma has been diluted at least 1:400. Some virus neutralization by this early antibody has been demonstrated but is incomplete due to the presence of virus quasispecies that are resistant to neutralization. Anti-LDV antibody that is not complexed to virus can be detected by 15 days after infection, indicating that antibody is present in excess of virus in chronically infected mice. Although the presence of anti-LDV antibodies does not prevent infection of macrophages, it does effectively neutralize neurovirulent LDV strains and so protects motor neurons from becoming infected. LDV-infected mice display a polyclonal humoral response and anti-LDV antibody apparently accounts for only a small portion of this polyclonal response. The mechanism by which LDV infection activates B cells polyclonally is currently not known, but mice immunized with inactivated virus do not develop a polyclonal response. Autoantibodies to a variety of cellular components (autoimmune antibodies) have been detected in mice chronically infected with LDV.",

However, in some EAV and PRRSV infections and in all LDV infections, persistent infections develop even though good levels of neutralizing antiviral antibodies and helper and cytotoxic T-cell responses are elicited. The mechanisms by which these viruses evade clearance by the adaptive immune system include extensive glycosylation of the major glycoprotein GP 5 that masks the major neutralization epitope of some strains of the virus, and enhanced infection of macrophages by infectious viral immune complexes via cell surface Fc receptors. Neutralization escape virus variants have been reported to arise during persistent LDV infections and may also arise during persistent infections with other arteriviruses. An immunodominant decoy epitope located just upstream of the neutralization epitope in PRRSV GP 5 induces a strong non-neutralizing antibody response and may be responsible for the weak/absent induction of neutralizing antibodies during the first month of infection.",

Animals immunized with live vaccines can spread virus and can become persistently infected. Outbreaks of disease due to reversion of live PRRSV vaccines have been reported. To allow discrimination between natural and vaccine infections, markers have been engineered into one EAV live vaccine.

It seems likely that other host species, including humans, harbor additional members of this virus family. However, such viruses will be difficult to find if the natural hosts develop asymptomatic infections. Little is yet known about the functional roles of the arterivirus proteins in the virus life cycle. Recent studies suggest that the arterivirus nucleocapsid and envelope proteins have unique properties. The intense current interest in dissecting the structure and function of the SARS-coronavirus replicase may provide new insights for similar analyses of the arterivirus replicase. The availability of reverse genetic systems for several of the arteriviruses will not only aid the further molecular characterization of these viruses but will also facilitate the study of viral pathogenesis and antiviral immunity as well as the development of improved vaccines.",

            "text": "The family Ascoviridae is one of the newest families of viruses, established in 2000 to accommodate several species of a newly recognized type of DNA virus that attacks larvae of insects of the order Lepidoptera. Viruses of this family produce large, enveloped virions, measuring 130 nm in diameter by 300-400 nm in length, and when viewed by electron microscopy have a reticulated appearance. They are typically bacilliform or reniform in shape, and contain a circular double-stranded DNA genome that, depending on the species, ranges from $120 to 185 kbp. Whereas the virions of ascoviruses are structurally complex like those of other large DNA viruses that attack insects, such as those of iridoviruses (family Iridoviridae) and entomopoxviruses (family Poxviridae), they differ from these in two significant aspects. First, ascoviruses are transmitted from diseased to healthy lepidopteran larvae or pupae by female endoparastic wasps when these lay eggs in their hosts. Second, ascoviruses have a unique cell biology and cytopathology in which shortly after infecting a cell, they induce apoptosis and then rescue the developing apoptotic bodies and convert these into virion-containing vesicles. This aspect of viral reproduction apparently evolved to disseminate virions to the larval blood where they could contaminate the ovipositors of female wasps so that the virus could be transmitted to new hosts. Ascoviruses appear to occur worldwide, wherever there are endoparasitic wasps and larvae of species belonging to the lepidopteran family Noctuidae. However, as these viruses have been discovered relatively recently and their signs of disease are not commonly known in the scientific community, relatively few ascovirus species have been described.",

The genomic open reading frames are indicated and the names of the corresponding proteins are given. Below the genome, the nested set of mRNAs found in infected cells is depicted, with RNA1 being identical to the viral genome and subgenomic RNAs 2-7 being used to express the structural protein genes located in the 3 0 -proximal quarter of the genome. With the exception of the bicistronic mRNA2, the subgenomic mRNAs are functionally monocistronic. The EAV replicase gene organization is depicted in the polyprotein pp1ab from the replicase (pp1a is identical to the nsp1-8 region of pp1ab). Ribosomal frameshift (RFS) delineates the boundary between amino acids encoded in ORF 1a and ORF 1b and arrows represent sites in pp1ab that are cleaved by papain-like proteases (yellow and blue) or the main (3CL) protease (red). The proteolytic cleavage products (nsps) are numbered and the locations of various conserved domains are highlighted. These include domains with conserved Cys and His residues (C/H), putative transmembrane domains (TM), protease domains (PL1, PL2, and 3CL), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (RdRp), helicase (HEL), and uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (N).
