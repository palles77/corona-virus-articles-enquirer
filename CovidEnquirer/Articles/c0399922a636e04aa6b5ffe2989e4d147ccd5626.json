            "text": "To gain insight into the mechanism of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) S-layer protein antiviral activity, we examined how S-layer protein impacts porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection and PEDV-induced apoptosis of Vero cells. Pretreatment (exclusion assay), coincubation (competition assay), and post-treatment (displacement assay) of PEDV-infected Vero cells with the S-layer protein was examined. Interestingly, significant inhibition of PEDV by S-layer protein was only observed in the exclusion assay. In Vero cells infected with PEDV, we found that apoptosis was mediated by activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in the late stage of infection. When PEDV-infected Vero cells were pretreated with S-layer protein, rates of Vero cell apoptosis were markedly decreased and cell damage was significantly reduced, as evaluated by flow cytometry and microscopy. Detailed analyses showed that the S-layer protein inhibited caspase-8 and caspase-3 activity. Taken together, our results suggest that L. acidophilus S-layer protein plays an inhibitory role during PEDV infection of Vero cells, and that the antagonistic activity of the protein is not via competition with PEDV for binding sites. In addition, the findings suggest that L. acidophilus S-layer protein protects against PEDV-induced apoptosis through reduced caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation in the later stages of infection. This mechanism may represent a novel approach for antagonizing PEDV and other viruses.",

            "text": "Apoptosis is an innate host defense mechanism that disrupts bacterial or viral replication by eliminating infected cells. Bacteria can hijack a host's apoptotic pathway to enhance their own pathogenesis in epithelial cells, resulting in a delayed apoptotic response and, subsequently, cell damage. The delay in onset of epithelial cell apoptosis may be critical for some intracellular pathogens, providing sufficient time for proliferation and adaptation to the intracellular environment and increasing the extent of cellular damage (Faherty and Maurelli, 2008; Kim et al., 1998; Philpott et al., 2001) . Li et al. found that L. acidophilus S-layer proteins inhibit bacteria-induced apoptosis (Li et al., 2011) , which is considered one of the most important antimicrobial functions of these proteins. Many viruses can actively induce apoptosis as a response to viral replication, thereby enabling the release and dissemination of viral progeny to neighboring cells. This apoptotic event is one of the cytolytic properties of viral infections causing cytopathic effects (CPE) in vitro and also contributes to viral pathogenesis in vivo, resulting in cell damage, tissue injury, and increased disease severity (DeDiego et al., 2011; Favreau et al., 2012; Lan et al., 2013) . At present, it is unknown whether L. acidophilus S-layer proteins inhibit virus-induced cell apoptosis.",

In this study, L. acidophilus S-layer protein was shown to have an inhibitory effect on PEDV infection in Vero cells. Three association assays (exclusion, competition, and displacement assays) were conducted to investigate the underlying mechanism of how S-layer proteins inhibit PEDV infection. A previous study found that L. acidophilus S-layer protein has significant antagonistic activity against S. Typhimurium infection of Caco-2 cells (Li et al., 2012) . The resulting data supported the proposed antimicrobial mechanisms of L. acidophilus S-layer protein, including competition for binding sites on the surface of host epithelial cells and direct interaction between S-layer protein and the S. Typhimurium cell surface. Interestingly, inhibition of PEDV infection of Vero cells was only observed in the exclusion assay in the current study. These results further demonstrate that L. acidophilus S-layer protein can antagonize the entry and replication, but not attachment, of PEDV in Vero cells. Simultaneous infection and post infection treatments with Slayer did not have an effect in viral infection, leading to the idea that the inhibition caused by S-layer may be due to an early effect during viral replication cycle or PEDV entry in Vero cells. Consequently, we concluded that the antiviral activity of S-layer protein is not based on competition with PEDV for binding sites on the host cell. However, Slayer protein has previously been shown to bind to the C-type lectin DCspecific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin receptor (DC-SIGN, CD209) (Prado Acosta et al., 2016) . DC-SIGN is a cell-surface adhesion factor that enhances the entry of viruses belonging to several different families into the host cell. S-layer protein inhibits JUNV infection via direct interaction with the DC-SIGN receptor (Martinez et al., 2012) . Whether the S-layer proteins inhibit PEDV infection by binding to DC-SIGN receptors needs to be examined further.",

Caspase-3 is activated by both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, and is responsible for the morphological features of apoptosis (Lee and Lee, 2018) . Apoptotic factors caspase-3 and caspase-8 are up-regulated during PEDV infection, especially in the later stages (Ming-Ming et al., 2014) . PEDV coronavirus induces HEK 293 T apoptosis via activation of caspase-3 by papain-like protease (Qian et al., 2015) . Interestingly, Kim et al. could not detect any cleaved caspase-3 in PEDV-infected cells up to 48 h post-infection. A small amount of activated caspase-3 appeared at 48 h post-infection, which is likely to be the basal level normally present in the late stage of infection (Kim and Lee, 2014) . In the present study, our results clearly indicated that PEDV can mediate cellular apoptosis by inducing caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation. Caspase-3 activity in Vero cells was decreased at 8, 12, and 24 h post-infection and then significantly increased late in the infection cycle. Our findings suggest that the delayed onset of PEDV-induced apoptosis may be the result of inhibition of caspase-3 activation. Likewise, chemical suppression of caspase activation was found to be partly abrogating PEDV infetion. Kim et al. found that PEDV induces caspase-independent apoptosis through activation of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (Kim and Lee, 2014) . Our results indicated that caspase may play a part in the late stage of PEDV infection. The phenomenon of none of the doses of inhibitor affected in PEDV infection needs further study.",

We have previously shown that Slayer proteins inhibit caspase-3 activity and activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway in Caco-2 cells (Li et al., 2011) . In the present study, S-layer protein alone inhibited the activity of both caspase-8 and caspase-3 in Vero cells. We found that caspase-3 activity was significantly decreased at 24 h postinfection with PEDV, while S-layer proteins could also inhibit the activity of caspase-3. Interestingly, when PEDV-infected Vero cells were pretreated with S-layer proteins for 1 h, caspase-3 activity was increased compared with that in cells treated with PEDV or S-layer protein alone. This might be related to the reduction in the number of invading viruses caused by the S-layer proteins. In addition, the S-layer proteins antagonized the upregulation of caspase-3 activity caused by PEDV in the later stages of infection. This antagonistic activity of the Slayer proteins may be directly involved in their inhibition of caspase-3 activation. S-layer proteins may counteract cellular changes induced by PEDV infection by affecting host cell apoptosis in vitro. In other words, S-layer proteins are involved in active defense rather than frontal attack against PEDV-induced apoptosis.",
