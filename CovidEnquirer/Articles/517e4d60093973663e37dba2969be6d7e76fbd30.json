            "text": "The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the key protein for the formation of the helical nucleocapsid during virion assembly. This protein is believed to be more conserved than other proteins of the virus, such as spike and membrane glycoprotein. In this study, the N protein of SARS-CoV was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5a and identified with pooled sera from patients in the convalescence phase of SARS. A plasmid pCI-N, encoding the full-length N gene of SARS-CoV, was constructed. Expression of the N protein was observed in COS1 cells following transfection with pCI-N. The immune responses induced by intramuscular immunization with pCI-N were evaluated in a murine model. Serum anti-N immunoglobulins and splenocytes proliferative responses against N protein were observed in immunized BALB/c mice. The major immunoglobulin G subclass recognizing N protein was immunoglobulin G2a, and stimulated splenocytes secreted high levels of gamma interferon and IL-2 in response to N protein. More importantly, the immunized mice produced strong delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and CD8 + CTL responses to N protein. The study shows that N protein of SARS-CoV not only is an important B cell immunogen, but also can elicit broad-based cellular immune responses. The results indicate that the N protein may be of potential value in vaccine development for specific prophylaxis and treatment against SARS.",

            "text": "A worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been associated with a novel coronavirus, termed with SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which has strong infectivity and pathogenicity (Drosten et al., 2003; Falsey et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003) . Recently, several new cases have been confirmed in Taiwan and mainland of China, Singapore, and the Philippines. The coronaviruses are large, enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses. The spike glycoprotein protein (S) forms conspicuous peplomer structures on the surface of the virus particle and is responsible for many of the biological properties of the virus, such as attachment to cell receptors, penetration, and spread by virus-induced cell to cell fusion (Gagneten et al., 1995; Popova and Zhang, 2002; Sanchez et al., 1999; Taguchi and Shimazaki, 2000) . Antibodies to this protein not only neutralize the virus in vitro, but also provide protection against lethal virus challenge (Daniel and Talbot, 1990; Taguchi et al., 1995; Torres et al., 1995) . Although the S protein is the immunodominant structural component, coronavirus infection also induces immune responses to other structural proteins, such as the membrane glycoprotein (M) and the nucleocapsid protein (N). The predicted N protein of SARS-CoV is a highly charged, basic protein of 422 amino acids with seven successive hydrophobic residues near the middle of the protein (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The cellular immune response against N protein of some animal coronaviruses can enhance the recovery from the virus infection (Glansbeek et al., 2002; Wasmoen et al., 1995; Wesseling et al., 1993) . Immunization with plasmid DNA encoding microbial antigens has provided protective immunity in some animal models and is therefore considered a potentially useful vaccine strategy (Fuller et al., 2002; Kamili et al., 2004; Padua et al., 2003) . This technique involves the transfer of a target antigen gene into muscle cells by a plasmid vector with subsequent endogenous production and presentation for the induction of systemic immune responses. In this aspect, DNA immunization appeared to mimic natural viral infection. Hence, DNA vaccines may provide a useful tool to dissect the immunogenicity of a certain viral protein and define its roles in viral immunity.",

In the present study, we found three kinds of SARS-CoV N proteins with different molecular mass expressed in E. coli and all of them could react with the pooled sera from convalescence phase of SARS patients. Two of the proteins with lower molecular mass may be degraded from the amino terminus of the intact N fusion protein since both could be purified by Ni-NTA affinity resin (the six histidine residues are located at the amino terminal of the fusion protein). In our observation, the N protein is more sensitive to react with sera of SARS patients relative to the S protein of SARS-CoV expressed in E. coli (Zhao et al., 2004) . This is consistent with those found in some animal coronaviruses, indicating that the N protein may be a sensitive antigen for SARS-CoV infection (Wesseling et al., 1993) . But it is still necessary to observe its time course to evaluate the meaning for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection. BALB/c mice were immunized with 200 Ag of DNA vaccine pCI-N or control plasmid pCI-neo three times at 2-week intervals. The mouse serum samples were collected at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 post-immunization and detected for IgG against N protein of SARS-CoV. The data are presented as mean value of ELISA of 1:100 diluted serum samples F SD at various time courses. n = 12 mice. a P N 0.5, compared with that of pCI-neo immunized group. b P N 0.05, compared with that of pCI-neo immunized group. c P b 0.01, compared with that of pCI-neo immunized group. d P b 0.01, compared with that of pCI-neo immunized group. e P b 0.001, compared with that of pCI-neo immunized group. The DNA construct pCI-N, which was proved to be able to express the N protein in eukaryotic cells, was used to immunize BALB/c mice. The mouse serum anti-N antibody response was detectable in the pCI-N immunized group after the second immunization and continued to increase after boosts. Seventy five percent of the mice developed anti-N IgG antibody after three times of immunization. It is unlikely that the antibodies against N protein play a neutralizing role due to its internal position in the virion. Some researchers reported that antibodies to N protein of murine hepatitis virus (MHV, an animal coronavirus) had no neutralizing activity in vitro, but a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to the protein prevented the cytopathic effect of MHV on L cells, and passive transfer of this antibody protected mice from acute MHV infection (Lecomte et al., 1987; Nakanaga et al., 1986) . That whether the antibodies to N protein of SARS-CoV have the similar protective effect in vivo needs to be further investigated.",

Therefore, to enhance specific cellular immune response by vaccine administration is likely to accelerate the clearance of the virus and represents a potential alternative therapeutic method against SARS. As an internal protein of SARS-CoV, N protein is more conserved than surface protein such as S or M proteins, which makes it an ideal candidate for inclusion in a broadly protective vaccine for induction of cellular immune response. It was reported that vaccination with adenovirus vector expressing N protein of MHV could protect a significant fraction of mice against a lethal infection, which indicates that the N protein can generate a protective immune response (Wasmoen et al., 1995; Wesseling et al., 1993) .

The production of the Th2 cytokine IL-4 and IL-10 by stimulated splenocytes was also increased 5to 6-fold in animals inoculated with N protein expression plasmid.

CD8 + T cells recognize viral antigens in the form of short peptides presented by MHC class I molecules on the surface of virus-infected cells. The recognition of these viral peptides in the context of MHC molecules by CD8 + T cells can trigger the specific lysis of virally infected cells (Kagi et al., 1995) or noncytopathic intracellular inactiva- (Castro and Perlman, 1996; Glass and Lane, 2003; Wang and Chen, 2004) . The mice immunized with plasmid pCI-N developed significant footpad swelling responses compared with the control plasmid immunized mice. More importantly, generation of DTH activity occurred independent of anti-N antibodies, which suggests that CD8 + T cell activation may be induced by N protein without a coexisting humoral immune response. The four test mice all developed significant DTH response although two of them failed to produce obvious anti-N antibody. Using the syngeneic BALB/c-derived P815 mastocytoma cells that stably express SARS-CoV N protein as target cells, we observed that the splenocytes from pCI-N immunized mice showed significant CTL activity, which could kill the N proteinexpressing target efficiently, but could not kill the native P815 target cells. Our data on the DTH reaction assessed using footpad swelling and results of the CTL assay clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV-specific CMI was elicited by the DNA construct pCI-N. Recently, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte response targeted to SARS-CoV N protein by DNA immunization was also reported by Zhu et al. (2004) and Kim et al. (2004) . Together with our findings, we believe that the N protein of SARS-CoV is an important immunogen for T lymphocytes and may play a concernful role in immunity-mediated virus elimination.",
