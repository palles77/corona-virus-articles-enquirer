            "text": "Due to the complexity of biological membrane, computer simulation of transmembrane protein's folding is challenging. In this paper, an implicit biological membrane environment has been constructed in lattice space, in which the lipid chains and water molecules were represented by the unoccupied lattice sites. The biological membrane was characterized with three features: stronger hydrogen bonding interaction, membrane lateral pressure, and lipophobicity index for the amino acid residues. In addition to the hydrocarbon core spanning region and the water solution, the lipid interface has also been represented in this implicit membrane environment, which was proved to be effective for the transmembrane protein's folding. The associated Monte Carlo simulations have been performed for SARS-CoV E protein and M2 protein segment (residues 18-60) of influenza A virus. It was found that the coil-helix transition of the transmembrane segment occurred earlier than the coil-globule transition of the two terminal domains. The folding process and final orientation of the amphipathic helical block in water solution are obviously influenced by its corresponding hydrophobicity/ lipophobicity. Therefore, this implicit membrane environment, though in lattice space, can make an elaborate balance between different driving forces for the membrane protein's folding, thus offering a potential means for the simulation of transmembrane protein oligomers in feasible time.",

Alternatively, much of the attention has been paid on the treatment of lipid membrane in two fashions.

Two consecutive \u03b1-helical H-bonds (from i to i + 4) can shape a minimal \u03b1-helical block, in which all residues along the sequence belong to this helical block. Two minimal \u03b1-helical blocks can build a long \u03b1-helical block with no less than two shared consecutive residues. The maximal helical block can reach the chain length of a polypeptide segment. Based on this algorithm, the helical ratio and the length of helix blocks, i.e. \u03b8 and L h , can be determined. Fig. 1 presents several typical snapshots for the thermodynamic folding progress of SARS-CoV E protein. The polypeptide chain started folding from a coil conformation (Fig. 1A) , and finally evolved into a transmembrane protein (Fig. 1E ). Fig. 2 shows the variations of reduced specific heat and chain energy during thermal annealing. Here, a dimensionless temperature T * (\u2261k B T/\u03b5 0 ) is defined, where k B is Boltzmann constant. Clearly, two separated peaks occurred for the reduced specific heat curve at 1/T * = 1.60 and 4.96, which should correspond to two thermodynamic transitions. The hydrogen bonding energy (E hbond ) and the hydrophobic and lipophobic energy (E phobic ) decreased rapidly around 1/T * = 1.60 and 4.96 respectively, indicating that those two transitions are the coil-helix transition and the coilglobule transition.",

The half ratio of the helical property was chosen to quantificationally describe the folding process for the helix(25-46) segments and the helix(51-59) segments, which are at 1/T * = 1.44 and 2.64 respectively. The transmembrane helix formed at higher temperature because of stronger hydrogen bonding in the hydrocarbon core of the membrane. Due to the big energy gap for hydrogen bonding between in hydrocarbon core and in water solution, the hydrogen bonded residues preferred to immerge into the membrane. In contrast, the amphipathic helix(51-59) shaped more slowly in water solution for lack of enough hydrophobicity. Therefore, the helix formation process was affected by its corresponding hydrophobicity or lipophobicity, indicating a certain degree of coupling between helix formation and chain collapse. ",

After being in shape, the transmembrane helix(25-46) adopted an orientation with \u03c9 \u2248 20\u00b0, consistent with the experimental results [44, 45] . The tilt angle for the amphipathic helix(51-59) was about 55\u00b0at high temperature when in coil conformation, and then mounted up to about 70\u00b0at low temperature because of lipophilic interaction with the membrane interface, which means that the helix(51-59) is nearly parallel to the membrane. The orientation fluctuation as displayed by the error bar in Fig. 8B was somewhat considerable. This may resulted from the weak hydrophobicity of the helix(51-59), indicating that oligomer may be a more stable form for M2 protein. As illustrated in the NMR experiment [31] , the M2(18-60) tetramer forms a C-terminal base via the right-handed packing of four amphipathic helices.",

The biological membrane was characterized with three features: strong hydrogen bonding, membrane lateral pressure, and lipophobicity. Moreover, another feature of this implicit membrane model is the representation of lipid interface, which was proved to be very resultful for the folding of transmembrane protein.",

In the folding process of SARS-CoV E protein, the coil-helix transition occurred obviously earlier than the coil-globule transition, demonstrating that the coil-helix transition and the coil-globule transition were apart from each other in the thermodynamic folding process of the transmembrane protein. For the M2(18-60) segment, the transmembrane helix formed earlier than the amphipathic helix(51-59), and the latter finally adopted an orientation nearly parallel to the membrane surface. Thus, the coil-helix transition process for the membrane protein segment and final layout in the membrane environment are obviously influenced by its corresponding hydrophobicity or lipophobicity. The different folding processes for helix and helix(51-59) resulted from the competition between membrane lateral pressure, hydrogen bonding strength, and related hydrophobicity or lipophobicity. Such phenomena bear evidence of our implicit membrane model on the elaborate balance between different driving forces for membrane protein.",

In this work, the implicit membrane environment and associated coarse-grained model can efficiently reduce the workload and therefore provide ensemble averaged results in feasible time.
