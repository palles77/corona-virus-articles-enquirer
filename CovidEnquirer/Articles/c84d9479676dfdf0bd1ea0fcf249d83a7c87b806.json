Although it has been known since ancient times, it became familiar to the Greeks and Romans during the Middle Ages, before that bismuth was often confused with other metals, such as lead and tin. It is considered to be a metal in the periodic table but has more similarity to semimetals. Bismuth is categorized among the group of elements conventionally known as \"poor elements\" due to its rarity. It has been used quite extensively for various purposes including cosmetic, industrial, laboratory, and pharmaceutical. Bismuth serves as a leading nontoxic replacement for lead in brass plumbing fixtures, fishing sinkers, free machining steels, and solders, as well as a metallurgical additive in the foundry. The manufacture applications of bismuth also include ceramic glazes, pearlescent pigments, lubricating greases, and crystal ware.",

Substitution of the formerly widely used lead-based EP additives by bismuth-sulfur additives not only provides a higher lubricant efficacy, but also reduces the amount of heavy metal used in extreme-pressure lubricants by a half, in accordance with the new ecological and environmental philosophy of the world. In recent decades, the substitution of lead with bismuth in glass production may lead to potential application for bismuth in the manufacturing of automobile glass, the finest tableware, and art objects, with the purpose of environmental protection. In North America, BieSn has been used to replace lead in shotshells for the hunting of wetland birds. Although the bismuth-containing shotshells cannot be approved as \"nontoxic,\" in comparison to the high toxicity of lead (e.g. a toxic intake level of 1 mg for a 70 kg human), the higher tolerance to bismuth among humans (e.g. a toxic intake level of 15 \u00c2 10 3 mg for a 70 kg human) renders it a \"relatively\" safe substitute for preventing environmental problems caused by lead accumulation. Owing to their satiny luster and low absorption properties, some bismuth compounds such as bismuth oxychloride and bismuth vanadate have also been used in cosmetics including nail polishes, lipsticks, and eye shadows. Recently in Europe, the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS-2002/95/EC) has stated that lead must be eliminated in the manufacturing of various types of electronic and electrical equipment. This restriction, which has been supported by commercial and research organizations in Japan and the North America, may further increase the demand for bismuth in industry in future, and accelerate the replacement of lead and other heavy metals with bismuth in the manufacturing industry.",

A recent report showed that bismuth inhibits urease activity by disruption of the cellular maturation of urease via functional perturbation of one of its accessory proteins, UreG, rather than directly targets the metal center of urease.

These complexes show antimicrobial activity against some Gram-negative bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as some Gram-positive bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at micromolar levels. Subsequent studies show that Bi(III) thiolates exhibit remarkable anti-biofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus biofilms. Recent research indicates that the antimicrobial spectrum of bismuth thiolates could be further broadened when prepared in nanoparticle form (exemplified as BisBAL NPs). The enhanced antimicrobial potency of bismuth thiolates is possibly in part due to the chelation effect of thiols that significantly improves the solubility and lipophilicity of Bi(III) compounds, as well as the rapid exchange of those kinetically labile thiolate ligands inside bacterial cells.",

For example, a 9-coordinated Bi(III) complex of [Bi(H 2 L)(NO 3 ) 2 ]NO 3 (H 2 L \u00bc 2,6diacetylpyridine bis((4)N-methylthiosemicarbazone)) has an IC 50 value of 26.8 mM against K562 leukemia cells and an inhibitory rate of 61.6% in a hepatocarcinoma (H22 cell line) xenograft mouse model. Bi(III) dithiocarbamate complexes with a general formula of Bi(S 2 CNR2) 3 exhibit powerful anticancer activity against seven cancer cell lines including breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and ovarian cancer cell line (IGROV) with IC 50 values of no more than 0.22 mM. A water-soluble bismuth cyclen based compound, abbreviated as Bi-TPC, exhibits great anticancer activity that is 100-time more potent than cisplatin, probably via interactions with DNA under physiologically relevant conditions. It has been shown that radioactive bismuth ( 212 Bi and 213 Bi) exhibits promising potential as a novel therapeutic agent for mall volume tumors. Both 212 Bi and 213 Bi have a series of branched decays, resulting in the emission of a\u00c0/b-particles. Although the half-life of 212 Bi is short (t 1/2 1 h), and radioactive lead ( 212 Pb, t 1/2 10.6 h) can be used as an in vivo generator of 212 Bi. With their short-ranged penetration (50-80 mm), bismuth radionuclides can reduce the nonspecific irradiation to normal tissues around the target cells. Furthermore, in order to deliver bismuth to the site of action effectively, a chelate ligand can be used together with bismuth radionuclides. In this type of combination treatment, the strong chelate ligand is conjugated to a monoclonal antibody or a fusion protein, a standard treatment for tumors, via modification of the ligand to eventually produce a bismuthradiolabeled \"complex.\" Once the metal radiolabeled \"complex\" is introduced into the host, it targets specific cell types or sites of diseases and releases the a-particles only at or near the tumor tissues, thereby minimizing damage to the surrounding normal tissues.",

The potential target of bismuth is the SCV NTPase/helicase, a zinc-containing enzyme that has RNA capping activity and controls the virus reproduction. Binding of bismuth may induce conformational changes in the enzyme, which subsequently affects the helicase RNA/DNA unwinding activity, thereby inhibiting the virus proliferation (Fig. 5) .",

Cisplatin and its analogs (e.g. carboplatin and oxaliplatin) have been used in clinics worldwide to treat various solid cancers. However, a major obstacle to the more widespread use of cisplatin-based drugs resides in their severe side effects. The major dose-limiting factor is nephrotoxicity, including tubular degeneration, loss of brush border, necrosis, and mineralization of the tubular epithelial cells. These renal damages are caused by platinum (Pt). The mechanism of platinum nephrotoxicity may be similar to that of mercury (Hg) and likely relates to the depletion of thiolate groups in the renal tubes. Bismuth compounds, such as bismuth (sub)nitrate, have been reported to alleviate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity without interfering its antitumor response.",

Over a long period of time, it remains a mystery that why bismuth(III) is selectively toxic to certain human pathogens rather than human beings. One possible reason is the limited gastrointestinal tract (GIT) absorption of bismuth after its oral administration. Recent studies indicated that glutathione (GSH) may play a vital role for bismuth metabolism and detoxification in mammalian cells. Bismuth ions were found to be passively absorbed, conjugated to GSH and then transported into vesicles via MRP transporter; the sequestration of absorbed bismuth consumed cytosolic glutathione and activated was in de novo biosynthesis, which in turn facilitated passive uptake of bismuth (Fig. 7) . The self-propelled positive feedback cycle actively eliminated bismuth from both intra-and extracellular space, thus protecting critical systems of human body from acute toxicity. Considering GSH is ubiquitous in most living cells, but only absent in certain anaerobic or microanaerobic bacteria such as H. pylori, the GSH and MRP mediated self-propelled disposal of bismuth in host cells might be accountable for the selective toxicity of bismuth drugs.",

Investigations of bismuthprotein interactions will not only improve understanding of the mechanism of action of bismuth but will also provide a basis for the design of more effective bismuth agents. Bismuth was found to be binding to transferrin (an iron transport protein) preferentially to the C-lobe with carbonate (CO 3 2 \u00c0 ) as a synergistic anion. Transferrin is likely to act as a bismuth transport \"vehicle,\" as it is only 30% saturated with iron in blood plasma. Importantly, the metal-bound transferrin can be rapidly recognized by the transferrin receptor because of the higher affinity of the receptor to metal-bound transferrin than to its apo-form (Fig. 8) . Although human serum albumin is the most abundant protein in serum (0.63 mM) and has been hypothesized to be the target of bismuth in plasma. Around 70% bismuth associates to transferrin and the rest to increasing bismuth concentration serum albumin, indicating a higher selectivity of bismuth to transferrin.",

The bismuth-bound lactoferrin is able to compete with the iron-bound lactoferrin in both the membrane and intracellular, providing another route for bismuth transport. Histidine-rich proteins, such as Hpn and Hpn-like (46.7% and 25% histidine residues, respectively) in H. pylori are also potential targets of bismuth ions. Mutagenesis experiments have shown that H. pylori with hpn gene knock-out are fourfold susceptible to bismuth antiulcer drugs than that of the wild-type, indicating a protective role of Hpn in H. pylori responses to bismuth-based therapies. The interaction of bismuth with enzymes is related to the high affinity to cysteine residues. For example, bismuth inhibits urease activity probably by blocking the enzyme active site by coordinating to a cysteine residue at the entrance of the active site.",

            "text": "Patients suffer toxicity at different bismuth levels in blood but the syndrome is rare when bismuth levels are below 50 mg/L. Among the bismuth-based regimens, the use of insoluble bismuth compounds such as bismuth oxychloride and bismuth subcarbonate are related to low toxicity, whereas the use of soluble bismuth organic compounds such as bismuth sodium tartrate and tripotassium dicitratobismuthate, or the combined use of bismuth with thiolate-containing ligands, are associated with high toxicity, such as neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. This is probably due to the enhanced uptake of soluble bismuth salts in human bodies. It has also been suggested that the oral bismuth drugs need to undergo methylation by intestinal microbes to enable them to be absorbed. Absorbed bismuth will accumulate in the kidneys, lungs, spleen, liver, brain, and muscles, and will be eliminated in urine and feces via bile and intestinal secretions. In the clinic, depending on the administration time of bismuth, its toxicity can be roughly divided into acute and chronic exposures. Both exposure doses can cause neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and increased bismuth concentration in blood. In spite of the toxicity, most of these side effects can be alleviated after the discontinuation of bismuth therapies. Bismuth iodoform paraffin paste (BIPP), which reduces the risk of bacterial infection, renders a deep necrotic wound cavity clean and promotes the development of granulation tissue, and is widely used in oral, maxillofacial, and ENT surgery (ear, nose, and throat surgery) as an antiseptic dressing. However, a few examples of serious adverse effects of BIPP were observed in the clinic when some patients were treated with BIPP. In one case, the patient became acutely confused and the gait became unsteady, indicative of an encephalopathy caused by over-dosage of bismuth. This was confirmed by the observation of a toxic level of bismuth in the patient's serum. Another case involved using BIPP to cover the dura mater in a wound after removal of a large basal cell carcinoma. The patient became confused and then comatose. An encephalopathy was confirmed by the observation of diffuse cerebral edema in a tomographic scan. However, upon removal of the BIPP, the patient recovered, and deteriorated if the pack was applied again. The mechanism of intoxication has not been well understood till now. It was probably caused by the interference of bismuth with the oxidative metabolism of the central nervous system by binding to essential enzymes and reducing cerebral blood flow.",

In one case, even the gastric lavage was performed initially, a 2-year-old boy suffered from an acute renal failure (ARF) associated with uremia and oliguria after ingestion of 28 De-Nol tablets (CBS, 8.4 g) for 2 days. After ingestion of CBS for 10 days, bismuth levels in both the blood and urine were 739 and 693 mg/L respectively. With the treatment of peritoneal dialysis, his urine volumes increased and plasma BUN and creatinine levels decreased gradually. After 100 days of admission, the patient recovered and his bismuth level in blood went back to normal. To cure some serious side effects caused by bismuth over-dosage, some antidotes such as d-penicillamine, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propane-sulfonic acid (DMPS), dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA), and dimercaprol have been tested in animals and limited clinical trials. It was shown that DMPS and DMSA effectively alleviate bismuth poisoning due to their strong chelating ability to bismuth ions. Further Reading",
