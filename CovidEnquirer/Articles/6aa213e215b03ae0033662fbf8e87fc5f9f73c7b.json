            "text": "man transmission studies two types of transmissible, presumably viral, hepatitis have been defined. The first, infectious hepatitis (IH; Type A) has a relatively short incubation period ( 1 5 4 5 days, but usually about 30-35 days), and may be transmitted by either the fecal-oral or parenteral route. Numerous common source epidemics attributable to contaminated food, watJer, or milk have been described. Secondary infections among close contacts are common, in households and, particularly, in large institutions for mentally retarded children in which IH may become established as an endemic problem. The second type, serum hepatitis (SH; Type B) has a long and highly variable incubation period (45 to more than 100 days). Until a few years ago, SH was thought to be transmissible only by parenteral inoculation. Recent transmission studies and epidemiological observations, however, have provided good evidence that the infecting agent may also be acquired by the oral route, and, like IH, may become endemic in institutional settings (Krugman et al., 1967) .",

Using this approach, and the Ouchterlony technique of two-dimensional double immunodiffusion, Allison and Blumberg (1961) and Blumberg et al. (1962) were able to define a new lipoprotein polymorphism, the Ag system. [Details of the original and later immunodiffusion methods will be discussed below (Section V, C)]. Continuing the search, Blumberg and his co-workers, in 1963, identified a new precipitating antigen with the help of serum from two multiple transfused hemophiliacs (Blumberg, 1964 ; Blurnberg et al., 1965) . These sera contained an antibody which reacted with the serum of an Australian aborigine to give a single line of precipitation. The precipitating component, designated \"Australia antigen,\" appeared to represent a single antigenic determinant, and was clearly distinct from previoudy tlcscribcd human seruin isoantigens. It was considcrctl at first to i w another cxample of a serum protein polyniorphisin. The possession of Australia antigen was held to distinguish the phcnotypc Au (1 j , reflecting the genotype Aul/Aul. The allele A7h1 was postulated to be autosomal and recessive. Thus, individuals lacking Australia antigen [phenotype Au ( O ) ] would bc either homozygous Au/Au, or heterozygous Au'/Au, the dominant Au allele acting to prevent synthesis or detection of the antigen Blumberg et al., 1967a) . This hypothesis of a simple genetic determination of Australia antigen was later modified, with the discovery of its peculiar association with leukemia, Down's syndrome, and hepatitis . I n the meantirnc, however, it had led to a notable series of studies by Blurnberg and his associates (Blumberg et al., 1965 (Blumberg et al., , 1967a , in which they looked for thc antigen in various populations in cliff erent parts of the world.",

The data in support of this expanded hypothesis were derived from studies of the island populations of Cebu (Philippines) and Bougainville (New Guinea) in which hygienic and sanitary conditions were such as to warrant the assumption that various orally transmitted infections, including both forms of viral hepatitis (Krugman et al., 1967) , would be endemic in the population so that there would be ample opportunity for exposure of all individuals, in time, to the infectious agents. The results, so far, do not appear to have disproved the hypothesis; but many more data from other presumably \"hepatitis-saturated\" populations demand analysis before this novel and provocative hypothesis can be accepted as nearing establishment.",

This association was later found to be true also for patients with Down's syndrome, lepromatous leprosy, and hepatitis (Blumberg et al., 1967a,b) . These workers further noted that among children with Down's syndrome, those in institutions showed a markedly higher frequency of Au antigen in their serum than those remaining at home (28 vs. 0%) (Sutnick et al., 1968) . Extending these observations, they and other investigators noted that the staff of mental hospitals and institutions likewise included more Au-positives than the general population. It became apparent that environmental conditions in such institutions were an important factor in determining the frequency of possession of Au antigen; and the suggested relationship with some acquired factor, or transmitted infectious agent, was strengthened by the finding of strikingly high proportions of antigen possessors among patients with diseases in which some deprcssion or disturbance of immunc function niight be expected, e.g., leukemia and lepromatous leprosy A more recent example of the tendency of nursing personnel, as well as patients, to acquire Au antigen is seen in the experience of chronic renal hemodialysis units (London et al., 1969a; Turner and White, 1969) .",

In most cases, the antigen persisted for one to several weeks and then disappeared. But in 2 out of 7, and 1 out of 14 cases, respectively, it was still present in the latest serum tested (5-7 months after inoculation). Others have confirmed and amplified these findings, e.g., Hirschman et al. (1969) , 4 of whose 46 Au-positive (Au+) cases of SH retained antigen for >10 months after onset; and Giles et al. (1969) , who reported persistence of Au for at least 3 years in 9 of 18 persons who received the MS-2 strain of SH agent. I n these patients, the serum glutamic oxaloacetic or glutamic pyruvic transaminase rose to abnormally high levels, usually 5 to 15 days after the initial appearance of AU ; but, thereafter, the correlation between elevated enzyme levels and serum antigen varied widely. I n most of the cases with overt disease, symptoms began some 7-21 days after Au antigen first became detectable.

The principal point of disagreement has been the question of whether it is implicated in both forms of viral hepatitis, or specifically limited to the long-incubation SH form. Suffice it to say here that in those studies involving well-documented, experimentally produced infections, the antigen has been regularly found in all, or almost all, cases of SH, but has not been detectable in short-incubation disease of IH type (Prince, 1968a; Giles et al., 1969; . Furthermore, in studies of several common-source outbreaks of IH type hepatitis, no Au antigen was demonstrable in any of the patients concerned Mosley et al., 1970) . It is noteworthy that none of a group of volunteers experimentally infected by mouth with the Akiba strain of I H (Neefe and Stokes, 1945 ) developed detectable antigen. One individual, who already possessed Au antigen in his serum before inoculation, continued to do so throughout the course of his experimental infection. However, a possible result of infection with the IH-type agent, in this case, was a decline in the concentration of the already circulating Au antigen between the fourth and eighth weeks after inoculation. It remains to be seen whether this was a coincidental fluctuation, or causally related to the experimentally introduced agent, eg., as the result of interference with Au antigen synthesis at the cellular level, or due t o the blocking effect of a circulating inhibitor or crossreacting antibody. Initial experiments to test the second possibility have so far yielded negative results .",

I n recent studies, there has been general agreement about the intermediate density, but some discrepancy in the precise figures: in CsC1, the maxima were 1.20 (Gerin e t al., 1969) , 1.21 (Le Bouvier and Hierholzer, 1969; Millman et al., 1970a) , and 1.24 gm/ml (Barker e t al., 1969) ; in sucrose, 1.16 (Gerin et al., 1969) to 1.18 (Le Bouvier and Hierholzer, 1969) ; and in potassium tartrate, 1.15 (Gerin e t al., 1969) . After treatment with ether, fluorocarbon, or sodium deoxycholate, the density increases, e.g., in CsC1, from 1.20 to 1.22 or 1.23 (Gerin e t al., 1969) , or from 1.24 to 1.27 or 1.28 ; or from 1.18 to 1.20-1.21 in sucrose (Le Bouvier and Hierholzer, 1969) . In one study (Gerin et al., 1969) , freezing and thawing, or treatment with Tween 80 of an Au antigen fraction, which had been twice banded in CsCl and then separated by rate sedimentation in sucrose, caused a fall in buoyant density from 1.20 to 1.18 in CsCl, and also resulted in the emergence of a \"significant amount\" of Au+ material with a density of 1.39 gm/ml.

Blumberg and his colleagues have employed the tube method of Preer and Preer (1959) to quantitate the Au antigen concentrations in their test sera. Unknown sera are tested in parallel against undiluted standard antiserum, and their content of Au antigen is expressed in Preer units, depending on the distance of the precipitate from the antigen-agar interface at a fixed time. For this purpose, the column of agar in the reaction tube is divided into 100 units. I n our laboratory, as a provisional method of assay, the roughly quantitative approach used for the measurement of poliovirus and rubella virus antigens (Le Bouvier, 1959) has been applied to the estimation of Au antigen and antibody. One serum pool containing Au antigen, and one containing anti-Au antibody, were selected as the reference standards. The position of equivalence for the Au system was found to be -0.4 of the distance from the Au antigen cup to the homologous antibody cup. The positions of the leading edges of precipitates formed by various interacting pairs of antigen and antibody dilutions were measured from photographs, and standard curves were drawn. The highest dilution of the standard antibody reactant still giving a distinct band of precipitate in the equivalence zone, with any dilution of the standard (or any other Au-specific) antigen reactant, was defined as containing 1 \"Yale unit\" of anti-Au precipitin per pl. The particular dilution of the antigen preparation with which it gave this precipitate was taken to contain 1 \"Yale unit\" of Au precipitating antigen per pl. Unknown reactants are compared with the standards, and their antigen or antibody content is similarly expressed in Yale units per p1.",

In the comparative study of Purcell et al. (1969) , the linear CF test employed was about 24 times more sensitive than ID in detecting Au antigen, but no more than 4 times more sensitive in detecting antibody. They used a modified Prince (1968a) method of ID, in which protamine sulfate was omitted from the gel. In Shulman and comparison, their complement consumption test was 200-300 times better than their ID procedure for the cle-tection of Au antigen, a quite remarkable degree of superiority. In our own series (Hierholzer and Le Bouvier, 1969) , which employed a linear C F test with two 100% units of complement, the difference was -16 times in favor of CF for detecting Au antigen; but there was at most only a 2 times difference in the ability to detect anti-Au antibody, and sometimes the ID method appeared to be slightly (-2 times) more sensitive than C F for this purpose, Perhaps the greatest success of CF in the serological study of SH infection has been the identification, by Shulman and Barker (1969) , of a transient phase in the later part of the incubation period, in most cases, during which the patient's serum becomes anticomplementary (AC) . This AC activity rises to a peak from 4 to 6 weeks after infection, and then declines, at the same time as free ALI antigen is first becoming detectable in the serum. I n some cases, a second AC phase is seen after free Au antigen ceases to be detectable in the serum; and sometimes anticomplementariness is the only serological anomaly observed. It was suspected that this apparent AC effect might in fact be due to actual fixation of complement resulting from the simultaneous presence of circulating antigen and antibody, and the formation of immune complexes. This was confirmed by the finding that addition of further known Au antigen, or antibody, to the serum in question produced a situation of antigen or antibody excess, with a consequent prozone of diminished CF. The Au-specific character of the AC activity was further shown by fractionating such sera on CsCl gradients and finding Au particles apparently coated with antibody in the AC fractions. Treatment of these fractions with fluorocarbon, which dissociates virus-antibody complexes, reduced or eliminated their AC activity, and often doubled their Au-antigenic activity detectable by the addition of known antibody.",

They studied 61 patients with a variety of diseases, including 33 in whom there was evidence of viral hepatitis: of these, 24 had Au antigen in the serum; these 24, and a further 6, showed a positive IF reaction for Au antigen in their biopsied liver cells. Of the remaining 28 patients, only 2 had Au antigen in the serum-an inmate of a mental institution and a patient with chronic renal disease who had received many blood transfusions. These, and an additional 7 patients, had IF+ liver biopsies: the diagnoses in-cluded postnecrotic and biliary cirrhosis, biliary atresia, ? bile duct carcinoma, and hepatic metastasis of a renal carcinoma. The cell smears were prepared by mincing the liver specimens and spreading drops of the resulting suspension on slides, and fixing with acetone. They were stained directly with a fluorescein-labeled rabbit antiserum. Positive IF reactions took 3 forms: discrete particles within the nucleus; diffuse fluorescence of the whole nucleus; and fluorescence of the nuclear rim. Occasionally, particles of fluorescent antigen were also seen in the cytoplasm.

Large drops of the blood (or serum) to be tested are spread in a film on glass slides, allowed to dry, fixed with acetone for 10 minutes a t room temperature, and air-dried. Uninactivated guinea pig sera, with and without anti-Au antibody, are spread over part of the film, allowed to stand in contact for 30 minutes at 37\"C, and then removed. The slides are then washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) , pH 7.4, exposed to fluorescein-labeled horse anti-guinea pig globulin, washed again, and examined with a low-power objective. Specimens containing Au antigen fluoresce with varying intensity, showing numerous bright points of light in the serum phase; the intact formed elements of the blood show no staining. The Au antigen content of sera can be roughly quantitated by testing drops of serial dilutions in the same way. Juji and Yokochi (1969) have made Au antigen-antibody precipitates, then washed and treated them with 3 M NaI to dissociate the anti-Au antibody, which they finally separated and recovered by exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-200 equilibrated with 3 M NaI. After dialysis against PBS, the antibody was used to coat human group 0, Rh-positive red cells which had been prepared by treatment with formalin and tannic acid. Control red cells were coated with normal human 7-globulin. For use as detectors of Au antigen, the antibody-coated red cells were suspended a t 0.5% concentration in PBS, pH 7.2, containing 1% normal rabbit serum.",

The method is therefore as much as 10 times more expensive in standard antiserum than the usual immunodiffusion procedures. However, it can apparently detect -3 times as many Au+ donors as ID, i.e., up to 4 in every 100 commercial donors, which is estimated to be about 90% of the probable carriers of SH agent in this group (Prince and Burke, 1970) . The technique is critically dependent on a number of factors, including temperature, pH, type of buffer, ionic strength, and voltage. But if these can be reliably standardized and controlled , and the tendency to nonspecific precipitation minimized, it may prove to be the method of choice for donor screening, especially since the results are available within a few hours.",

These entail the preparation of purified Au antigen, and its radioactive labeling with lZ31. The purification of Au antigen from serum was effected by either (1) two equilibrium centrifugations in CsCl, followed by a rate separation in sucrose (Gerin et al., 1969) , or (2) enzymatic treatment of Au particles concentrated by spinning, followed by gcl filtration on Sephadex G-200, velocity sedimentation in a sucrose gradient, and centrifugation to equilibrium in CsCl (Millman et al., 1970a) . After the labeling with radioiodine, Walsh et al. refractionated the conjugated Au particles on a Sephadex G-200 column, determining the peaks of radioactivity and immunoreactivity by radioimmunodiffusion.

Purcell et al.

Au antigen-antibody complexes would, of course, not be detectable by ID, unless dissociated before testing, as was shown by (vide infra: Section V1,C) ; but such complexes have been seen in the electron microscope in a case of acute hepatitis . In 3 of 22 cases, during the month after their Au antigen declined and disappeared, free anti-Au CF antibody was ephemerally detectable . I n at least one patient, two such ((cycles\" of free antigen and free antibody succeeded one another over a period of a few weeks (Krugman and Giles, 1970) .

I n two recipients of large amounts of blood (17 and 24 units, respec-tively), in whom no antibody was initially detected, a sharp rise in anti-Au C F antibody took place within 1-2 weeks of transfusion, suggesting a previous subliminal sensitization with Au antigen and a secondary antibody response on restimulation (Holland et ul., 1969) .",

I n those cases in which immune aggregates are visible, and in which the concentration of circulating antigen falls relatively soon, it is quite probable that an active cellular allergy has also been elicited.

Since it is more usual, in states of \"split tolerance,\" t o find continued antibody synthesis in the absence of cell-mediated reactivity, it seems likely that in persistent possessors of Au antigen the cellular allergic response is likewise suppressed, and that a situation obtains which is analogous to that of mice persistently and tolerantly infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (cf.

Apart from these, and the usual, smaller Au-antigenic particles, are any other morphological entities discernible in sera from SH patients, e.g., comparable with the coronavirus-like particles that have been seen in the serum of certain cases of Au-chronic active hepatitis (Zuckerman et al., 1970) , and also in sera from healthy individuals (Deinhardt et al., 1970) ? Clearly, the essential prerequisite for studies of this kind is a relatively simple and reproducible test of infectivity, either in vivo or in witro. It is to be hoped that cultural manipulations of cells from different biopsied tissues, including co-cultivation, and perhaps imposed fusion, with diverse indicator cells and organ explants, and possibly also maintenance as heterotransplants, may permit the Au synthetic activity of the infectious agent to be expressed and recognized. And indeed, as Bang (1969) asks, when commenting on the hypothesis that persistent carriage of Au antigen is genetically determined , is there in man, as in thc mouse, a specific cellular basis for an inherited resistance or susceptibility to infection-and diseas-caused by the hepatitis viruses?",

If the Au particles are being produced by hepatic, and perhaps also by lymphorcticular cells, the immune complexes might be expected to pass into the pulmonary capillaries and, if not there retained, into the systemic circulation, lodging in peripheral capillaries, e.g., in skin, central nervous system, and especially the renal glomeruli. There appear to be no reports, as yet, of lesions related to possible capillary trapping of aggregates, or of the presence of Au antigen or antibody in such situations, in cases of chronic hepatitis, whether in the active, aggressive type, or in the later stages of the relatively benign, persistent form. But such pathology might well be looked for, following the model of mice persistently infected with LCM virus, where the continuing, or slowly developing, production of antibody results in the formation of virus-antibody complexes and a consequent \"late disease\" of chronic glomerulonephritis (Hotchin and Collins, 1964; Oldstone and Dixon, 1969) .",

It seems clear that in the persistent possessor of serum Au antigen, there must be a rather firmly founded state of tolerance, involving not only the antibody synthetic mechanism, but also presumably the cellular immune mechanisms responsible for delayed-type hypersensitivity and the rejection of antigenically foreign or altered cells. Since it is precisely these chronic carriers of large concentrations of Au particles, lacking any detectable allergic response, who remain free from overt disease, suspicion is directed toward such responses as probable essential participants in the varying degrees of hepatic cell destruction that lead to elevation of serum transaminases, symptoms and signs of anicteric hepatitis, or the full-blown icteric disease.",

Around the middle of the incubation period (e.g., some 3-7 weeks after inoculation), the infected cells, in the liver and perhaps elsewhere, begin to synthesize new macromolecules with Au antigenic specificity which are either the virion itself, or virus-associated lipoprotein particles, or antigenically altered cell-membrane fragments. These are released into the circulation, to some extent by disintegration of the more susceptible or heavily infected cells, but principally by shedding or budding from cells which otherwise continue to function relatively normally, As the number of disrupted cells increases, so the serum transaminase levels rise. However, there are a t this stage no clinical symptoms; and the patient remains symptom-free, as long as his allergic responses remain minimal or imperceptible. But in many cases, the first-formed Au antigen has already evoked a low concentration of specific anti-Au antibody, all of which becomes bound to the growing numbers of Au particles. This antibody soon declines, to be followed by an excess of free Au antigen in the serum, which generally falls away, in its turn, within a few days to a few weeks. In some cases, there is then a detectable, usually transient, resurgence of antibody, which now begins to circulate in unbound form. I n others, there may bc subliminal levels of antibody, too low to be picked up by the methods of detection at present available.",

            "text": "Patients in the earlier phase, with \"anticomplementary\" immune complexes in their serum, do not yet show symptoms of hepatitis, despite their possession of bound, and sometimes also of free, antibody. It is therefore suggested that actual clinicnl disease is the result of a cellmediated allergic response ayainst infected cells which are in the process of producing Au particles, and whose surface membrane, and possibly also internal membranes, have acquired the specific new antigenic configuration. An active immunological attack on such hepatic, and other, cells would lead to massive cytolysis, with signs and symptoms indicating varying degrees of liver dysfunction. I n many cases, this energetic reaction, assisted perhaps by the residual antibody-producing capacity, destroys all virus-harboring cells and terminates the infection. Such is the outcome usually seen in relatively healthy individuals, e.g., the personnel who staff renal hemodialysis units (London et al., 1969a; Turner and White, 1969) . In contrast to these are those other individuals, e.g., patients with chronic renal disease undergoing hemodialysis and maybe also treatment with immunosuppressive agents, in whom the allergic response may be depressed to a greater or lesser degree, and who therefore fail to eliminate the infection. These individuals go on to become partially, or in some cases totally, tolerant persistent carriers of the SH agent and of the Au particles which are its hallmark. I n those with varying levels of incomplete tolerance, the cellular (and perhaps also humoral) responses may fluctuate; if so, these patients would be expected to show variations in their level of serum Au antigen, and would also experience corresponding exacerbations and remissions of their clinical condition. The more perfect and unbroken the tolerance, the smaller would be the clinical disturbance, and the more continuous and sustained the production of Au antigen. In some of these highly tolerant individuals, the SH agent might then indeed begin to behave as a \"slow virw,\" causing a gradually progressive destruction of one or more kinds of tissue, either by its own replication alone, or with the help of periodic, local, minimal, and soon circumscribed allergic reactions.",
