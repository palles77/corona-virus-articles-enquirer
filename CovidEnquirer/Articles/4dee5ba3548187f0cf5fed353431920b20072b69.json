            "text": "Recently we have heard warnings of an outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1). Although, to prevent such infections we must prepare antiviral drugs and type-specific vaccines against influenza, we need various simple and effective protection methods, such as the use of face masks for public health. Also, in any consideration of bacterial infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) also pose serious concerns which must be addressed. I examined the antiviral activity of gentian violet (GV) and GV-dyed cloth against the influenza A (H1N1) virus. Time-kill studies were carried out, and the virus titer was determined based on the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of GV against bacteria were also determined, and the killing activities of the GV-dyed cloth were judged from viable cell counts. GV immediately killed the influenza A virus and this was confirmed by electron microscopy. Moreover, cloth dyed with a combination of GV and copper showed not only excellent antiviral activity but also prominent bactericidal activities.",

            "text": "An influenza pandemic is an epidemic of an infectious disease with serious worldwide consequences. The 1918 influenza pandemic was severe and killed over 30 million people. During 2004, a highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1) appeared, causing poultry disease in a large part of Asia. [1] [2] [3] This avian H5N1 strain has already infected at least 89 persons and killed 52 who had close contact with birds. 2, 4, 5 It was naturally thought that this avian virus would not infect humans, because humans have receptors specific for human viruses, not for avian viruses. However, recent studies have shown that H5N1 seems to have aquired the ability to infect mammals such as pigs and cats. 6, 7 Although none of the H5N1 strains have shown evidence of having aquired genetic changes with an efficient ability to transmit from human to human, it may be possible for a reassortment between an avian and a human influenza virus to occur in time. 4 If H5N1 evolves to become easily transmittable among humans, we would likely face an even more severe pandemic than that of 1918. Influenza is an infective respiratory disease, so some of the infection control efforts should be directed at shutting off the airborne route or at eliminating the source of infection with antiseptics.",

This triphenylmethane dye is widely used as a stain, and as a dye for silk, cotton, and leather (GV color index [CI], 42555). Therefore, simple common procedures were used for dyeing the cloth. Briefly, washed 20-mm-square pieces of cotton cloth were boiled in 3% tannic acid for 10 min, cooled, and then dyed in 0.005-0.001% GV heated to 100\u00b0C.

Therefore, I searched for chemicals which could enhance the killing activity of GV against Gram-negative bacteria. Metals such as Cu 2 , Zn 2 , and Ag 2 have weak bactericidal activity alone, but when GV and CuCl 2 were combined at a ratio of 10 : 1, the killing effect of GV on MDRP showed results eight times better than that of GV alone against MDRP (Table  1) .

A closely related triphenylmethane dye, malachite green (MG) and Cu 2 showed augmentation of antimicrobial activity similar to that seen with GV (Table 1) .

In the field of antimicrobial chemotherapy, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) or minimum lethal concentration (MLC) are terms often used for evaluating antimicrobial agents.

In untreated suspensions of DPBS, viable virus remained for 6 h within 1 log 10 below the viable counts observed immediately after the experiment (Fig. 2) , whereas GV and GV with CuCl 2 produced excellent antiviral activity against the H1N1 influenza virus. When 10 6.80 TCID 50 virus was exposed to 0.0063% GV, the residual viable count decreased to below 3 log 10 within 30 min and below 5 log 10 at 60 min (Fig. 2) . This indicates that the interaction of GV with the influenza virus is very rapid and GV completely destroys the infectivity of the influenza virus within 60 min. This finding was confirmed by electron microscopy. Purified influenza A virus particles showed two major glycoprotein projections on the surface: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (Fig. 3A) . When virus particles were treated with 0.0063% GV for 10 min, phosphotungstic acid (PTA) penetrated into them and it was obvious that the surface envelopes were destroyed (Fig. 3B) . Because the envelopes were broken, inner nucleocapsids were released, and this was the reason why infectivity was lost. Under these conditions, the suspension became slightly viscous, and virus particles easily made aggregations. At this stage, some traces of surface projections were observed (Fig. 3B, arrows) . After 60 min, the number of virus-like particles observed in Fig.  3B decreased and small pieces of membrane-like structures and their aggregates were prominent. GV and CuCl 2 in combination, at a ratio of 2 : 1 (0.0031% GV with 0.0016% CuCl 2 ), had antiviral activity similar to that of 0.0063% GV alone and more effective than that of 0.0031% GV or 0.0063% CuCl 2 (Fig. 2) . The 0.0016% CuCl 2 was a 16-times lower concentration of CuCl 2 than the CuCl 2 MLC (0.025%), so it was clear that the combination of GV and CuCl 2 had a synergistic antiviral effect. Thus, GV, or a combination of GV and CuCl 2 , was shown to be an excellent disinfectant against the influenza A virus, and these findings could shed further light on applications for prophylaxis against influenza.",

If this dangerous avian influenza virus should morph into a pandemic strain among humans, how would we face such a pandemic? As antibodies against envelope structures such as hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are essential to protect from infection, vaccination would be an ideal way to reduce the pandemic. [18] [19] [20] [21] However, a pandemic virus will be different from the strains that have previously been prevalent, and so current vaccines will be useless. Moreover, influenza viruses are easily able to mix genomes with other strains (reassortment), so this poses a significant risk for the manufacturers of developing and stocking large volumes of such vaccines, which may subsequently prove unreliable against pandemic strains.",

The maximum SD of the data points shown was less than log10 0.20 antiviral drugs. 18, 22 Tamiflu (Oseltamivir; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and related compounds, called neuraminidase inhibitors, reduce the release of virus particles from infected cells. It has been reported that drug-resistant strains have already appeared, and the proportion of resistant endemic strains has reached 18% in Japan; 23 such resistance has also happened for a pandemic strain. 24 In any case, both the development and stockpiling of vaccines or drugs entail political and financial difficulties. When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was in the news in 2003, various face masks, particularly N95 masks, were in urgent demand. As the N95 masks physically filter viruses out by fitting tightly over the mouth and nose, users have to breathe hard and so are unable to wear the masks for extended periods. Therefore, the N95 mask is not practical except in situations such as when healthcare workers or patients' family members are in close contact with patients in an emergency room or a ward. Based on experience with the SARS corona virus, Seto et al. 25 pointed out that cheaper polypropylene surgical masks were quite effective to prevent transmission among healthcare workers, and the masks were crucial for protection from droplet transmission. Kariwa et al. 26 studied the efficacy of several povidone-iodine (PVP-I) products for inactivating the SARS corona virus. 26 Here, I have compared the antiviral activity of GV with 0.5% PVP-I diluted from Isodine (Meiji Seika, Tokyo, Japan), which contained 10% PVP-I, corresponding to 1% effective I 2 . As shown in Fig. 2 , 0.0063% GV had a much greater killing effect than 0.5% PVP-I on the H1N1 virus. Certainly, PVP-I is a good disinfectant and it has been used for disinfection against various bacteria and viruses, but it seems to be difficult to dye cloth using I 2 products. On the other hand, using GV, we can dye cloth and retain the capacity to kill influenza viruses (Fig. 4) . When a reassortment has occurred, the unexpected variant influenza virus aquires new antigenicity, which voids the effectiveness of vaccines now in use. Even if this happens, however, GV may destroy not only the envelopes of H1N1 but also those of H5N1 and those of new variant strains. This is because the envelopes of influenza viruses, like cellular membranes which are easily damaged by GV, are essential and are made up of universal membrane components, i.e., lipid bilayers and proteins. Very recently, we have been given a warning of the increasing threat of an avian influenza A virus (H5N1) pandemic, issued by the writing Committee of the WHO. 27 Moreover, in articles in Science 28 and Nature 29 , it has been reported that the virulent 1918 influenza virus has been resurrected, and this constructed virus could be useful for preventing another pandemic. If the dyed cloth described here is made use of in cheaper masks, which easily become wet with exhalation and saliva, they might be able to capture respiration droplets. Consequently, I believe that a next influenza pandemic could be reduced if such GV masks (called Flu Mask) were used not only by health professionals but also by the general public worldwide. Moreover, GV seems to attack the envelope of influenza viruses (Fig. 3B) , so GV and GV-dyed cloth might be effective in preventing infections with other respiratory enveloped-viruses, such as the SARS corona virus.",
