            "text": "Objective: In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia. Methods: There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb. Results: Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response. Conclusion: Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds.",

This virus has affected many persons in China and spread to other countries in a very short time. On January 30, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and issued temporary recommendations under the International Health Regulations [2] . According to the Daily Report of China National Health Commission, as of this writing on February 2, 2020, 14,488 cases, including 304 deaths, have been confirmed in China; 146 cases, including 1 death, have also been reported among 23 other countries. This pandemic is still ongoing, so it is urgent to find new preventive and therapeutic agents as soon as possible. In addition, commensurate with the risk, strong measures for early detection, isolation and treatment of cases, as well as minimization of transmission through social interaction must be implemented.",

Development of these treatments may require months or years, meaning that a more immediate treatment or control mechanism should be found if possible. Herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine present a potentially valuable resource to this end. The effectiveness of herbal treatment to control contagious disease was demonstrated during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak [3] . As such, the Chinese government is encouraging the use of herbal plants in fighting this new viral pneumonia. However, the application of herbal treatment is mainly guided by the type of herb (based on the catalogue of classic literature on herbs) and the patient's symptoms or signs. There is often not enough information to predetermine whether the herbs in question can directly target the viral cause, in other words, herbal usage is generally not guided by viral pathology. We think more detailed knowledge about the direct antiviral effects of different plants would be greatly helpful to the doctors selecting them.",

The coronavirus encodes more than one dozen proteins, some of which are essential to viral entry and replication. Among these proteins, the most well-studied are papain-like protease (PLpro), 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and spike protein. Coronavirus PLpro not only processes the viral polypeptide onto functional proteins but is also a deubiquitinating enzyme that can dampen host anti-viral response by hijacking the ubiquitin (Ub) system. For example, SARS PLpro cleaves ISG15, a two-domain Ub-like protein, and Lys48-linked polyUb chains, releasing diUbLys48 products [13, 14] . SARS-3CLpro is a cysteine protease indispensable to the viral life cycle [15] . Coronavirus spike protein uses angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 as a receptor to help the virus enter cells [16] . These three proteins make attractive targets for drug development.",

Here, we propose two principles to guide such work: oral effectiveness and traditional usage compatibility. The first principle refers to the fact that most Chinese herbal plants are orally ingested after boiling with water, meaning that the anti-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) ingredients in selected plants should be absorbable via oral preparation. The second principle recognizes that candidate plants should be consistent with the type classifications for traditional herbal usage, since type-guided applications are integral to herbal use, as mentioned above. Following these two principles, we used a 6-step selection process (3 for each principle), including drug-likeness, evaluation of oral bioavailability, molecular docking, network pharmacology analysis and other methods to identify herbs that have both a high possibil-ity of containing effective anti-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) compounds and are classified as treating virus-caused respiratory infection.",

There are many kinds of Chinese herbs that have been used for thousands of years. Based on this rich history and experience, Chinese herbal medicines are divided into different types, each type dedicated to certain kinds of diseases. Ignoring these grouping guidelines can lead to serious side effects. Therefore, as a further condition for the medicine screened here, we verified that they have been routinely used to treat viral pneumonia. To meet this principle, we conducted another threestep screening process for the herbal plants.",

Because Chinese herbal medicines contain many ingredients, and multiple absorbable ingredients might exert their effects on the body, the general effects of herbs may be dictated by all of the absorbable ingredients they contain. With this consideration in mind, we extracted the recorded ingredients of each of the plants selected from the Chinese medicine database and screened these ingredients for drug-likeness and oral availability (via ADME filter) [26, 32] . The target proteins of all ingredients passing ADME selection were used for network enrichment to predict the general effects of the herbal plants. For all the plants analyzed, nearly half of the top 30 pathways enriched in KEGG are related to antiviral, immune/inflammatory responses and hypoxia response indicating that these herbs are suitable for anti-viral usage. In fact, some of the herbal plants selected here had been reported effective in against SARS-CoV infection in 2003 (online supplementary  Table S2 ). We thought that the general antiviral and immune/inflammation effects predicted for the 26 plants are correlated with the fact that these plants were selected according to Chinese herbal type classifications.",

Further, considering that the biologically validated natural compounds reported in the literature cannot cover all antiviral natural compounds, and the natural compounds included in the Chinese medicine database are not complete, the process that we have followed may have excluded herbs that would be well suited to this treatment. Nevertheless, the purpose of this screening was to provide a rational approach for selecting Chinese herbal medicines with a high potential efficacy in treating 2019-nCoV and related viruses. The specific dosage and usage of each herb should be determined based on patients' manifestations. Finally, the key step in this screening was molecular docking. The 3D structures of the proteins used here are based on reported gene sequences. If the virus mutates during transmission, a new screening is recommended.",
