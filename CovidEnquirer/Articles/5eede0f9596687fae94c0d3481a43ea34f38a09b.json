            "text": "Coronaviral infection is associated with up to 5% of respiratory tract diseases. The 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) of coronaviruses is required for proteolytic processing of polyproteins and viral replication, and is a promising target for the development of drugs against coronaviral infection. We designed and synthesized four nitrile-based peptidomimetic inhibitors with different N-terminal protective groups and different peptide length, and examined their inhibitory effect on the in-vitro enzymatic activity of 3CL pro of severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus. The IC 50 values of the inhibitors were in the range of 4.6e49 mM, demonstrating that the nitrile warhead can effectively inactivate the 3CL pro autocleavage process. The best inhibitor, Cbz-AVLQ-CN with an N-terminal carbobenzyloxy group, was w10x more potent than the other inhibitors tested. Crystal structures of the enzymeeinhibitor complexes showed that the nitrile warhead inhibits 3CL pro by forming a covalent bond with the catalytic Cys145 residue, while the AVLQ peptide forms a number of favourable interactions with the S1eS4 substratebinding pockets. We have further showed that the peptidomimetic inhibitor, Cbz-AVLQ-CN, has broadspectrum inhibition against 3CL pro from human coronavirus strains 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, and infectious bronchitis virus, with IC 50 values ranging from 1.3 to 3.7 mM, but no detectable inhibition against caspase-3. In summary, we have shown that the nitrile-based peptidomimetic inhibitors are effective against 3CL pro , and they inhibit 3CL pro from a broad range of coronaviruses. Our results provide further insights into the future design of drugs that could serve as a first line defence against coronaviral infection.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause a number of respiratory tract and gastroenteritis diseases in human and animals [1] . Coronaviruses can be classified into three main groups: alphacoronavirus (group 1), betacoronavirus (group 2), and gammacoronavirus (group 3), while the group 2 is further sub-divided into group 2a and 2b [2] . In addition to the SARS-CoV (group 2b) that caused the outbreak of pneumonia in 2003, the four human group 1 (229E and NL63) and 2 (OC43 and HKU1) strains are associated with up to 5% of respiratory tract disease cases reported [3, 4] . The single-stranded RNA genome of CoVs encodes two polyproteins, which are processed into at least 15 mature proteins by papain-like protease and 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) [5, 6] . Inhibition of the proteolytic processing can reduce viral replication and viral-induced cytotoxic effect [5, 6] . The ability of coronaviruses to generate novel strains with high virulence through high frequency of mutations and recombination remains a potential threat to human health. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a broad-spectrum drug that can combat against all kinds of coronavirus infection. Because 3CL pro is essential to viral replication and its active-site structure is conserved, the protease is an attractive drug target for the development of such a broadspectrum inhibitor [7] . The SARS-CoV 3CL pro can be inactivated by peptidomimetic inhibitors that are composed of a substrate-like peptide and a reactive warhead such as an aldehyde [8, 9] , a Michael acceptor [7, 10, 11] , a halo-methyl ketone [10, 12] , or an epoxide [13] . The peptide interacts with the substrate-binding cleft of the protease to form a non-covalent complex, and then the warhead covalently links with the catalytic cysteine residue and inhibits the enzyme.",

The protease activity in the presence of inhibitors was measured by using a fluorescent-protein substrate as described previously [14, 15] . The IC 50 values of 'Mic-AVLQ-CN', 'Boc-AVLQ-CN', and 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' were 49 AE 2, 49 AE 2, and 4.6 AE 0.2 mM, respectively ( Fig. 1) . Interestingly, the inhibitor with the Cbz protective group was w10x more potent than the other inhibitors tested. To test the effect of increasing the length of the peptidomimetic inhibitor, we synthesized a hexapeptide inhibitor 'Cbz-TSAVLQ-CN'. The IC 50 value for this inhibitor was 39 AE 1 mM (Fig. 1) , suggesting that increasing the length of the inhibitor did not improve inhibition and the Cbz group at the P4 position may be responsible for the higher potency of 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN'.",

In SARS-CoV, the catalytic dyad consists of Cys145 and His41 [16] . The inhibitor was covalently bonded with the thiol group of Cys145 via the carbon atom of the nitrile warhead ( Fig. 2A) . This mechanism is consistent with that observed in other cysteine proteases [17] . The side chains of P1-Gln, P2-Leu and P4-Ala occupied the S1, S2 and S4 subsites, respectively, of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , while the side-chain of P3-Val pointed towards the solvent ( Fig. 2A) . A number of hydrogen bonds are involved in enzymeeinhibitor interactions. The P1-Gln side chain was hydrogen-bonded with the backbone O atom of Phe140 and the side-chain of His163 and Glu166. The backbone amide groups of P2 to P4 formed hydrogen bonds with Glu166, Gln189 and Thr190, and these hydrogen bonds help the P3 and P4 residues to adopt a bstrand like conformation (Fig. 2B) .",

Our results showed that 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' can inhibit all 3CL pro tested, with values of IC 50 ranging from 1.3 to 4.6 mM (Fig. 3) . In contrast, the 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' had no observable inhibition effect on caspase-3 at 0.5e256 mM (Fig. S2, Supplementary material) , suggesting that the inhibitor is specific for 3CL pro from coronaviruses. As structures of 3CL pro from group 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 are similar, our modelling study suggests that the 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' inhibitor can fit nicely to the active site of 3CL pro from all groups of coronaviruses and inhibit the protease via the same mechanism (Fig. S3 , Supplementary material).

            "text": "In this study, we have shown that nitrile-based peptidomimetic inhibitors display broad-spectrum inhibition against 3CL pro from all groups of coronaviruses. Crystal structures of enzymee inhibitor complexes provide interesting insights in the design of peptidomimetic inhibitors. First, the enzymeeinhibitor binding is mainly determined by the tetrapeptide sequence, AVLQ. This suggestion is consistent with the observation that extending the length of the inhibitor to hexapeptide ('Cbz-TSAVLQ-CN') did not improve inhibition (Fig. 1) . Second, we found that the Cbz protective group at the N-terminus of the tetrapeptide can result in w10 fold increases in potency in the 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' inhibitor than the other inhibitors tested. This observation suggests that modification of the peptidomimetics, e.g. cross-linking the P3-Val with the Cbz groups, may further improve the efficacy of inhibition. Because of the high recombination frequency among the RNA genome of CoVs, development of a broad-spectrum inhibitor is an attractive strategy to combat against infection of all kinds of CoVs [7] . Here, we have shown that the nitrile-based inhibitor 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' can inhibit 3CL pro from all groups of CoVs tested with IC 50 values in the mM range. As nitrile-based protease inhibitors (e.g. odanacatib [18] , vildagliptin [19] ) have been successful in clinical applications [20] , our work demonstrated that the inhibitors described in this study may serve as a lead for the developmentof antiviral drugs that target a broad-spectrum of coronaviruses.",
