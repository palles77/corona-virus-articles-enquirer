No disease outbreak or epidemic escapes media coverage, whether it is an enteric disease due to contaminated lettuce, foodborne botulism, or the threat of \"bird flu.\" As Laurie Garrett points out in her thought-provoking book The Coming Plague (1995) , we seem to be living in a world that is out of balance. Our era may very well be characterized by eruptions of new diseases, epidemics of old diseases moving into new areas, diseases that are sparked by advances in technology, and diseases that come to us from insects and animals as civilization invades ecologies where humans have not trodden before (Garrett, 1995) . Although these encounters have been occurring throughout history, technology now enables us to define the problems with great acuity. Our ability to determine the causal relationship among pathogen, host, and disease relies heavily on state-of-the-art technologies brought to us by advances in science and engineering. Still, to this day the microscope remains a primary tool in the toolbox. Moreover, electron microscopy provides researchers with high-powered visual proof of the existence of the pathogens that cause disease (Fig. 5.1) .",

MOH authorities initially believed the outbreak was due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, a mosquito-borne ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus. However, JE vaccination and mosquito control efforts conducted over several months failed to halt the epidemic. Numerous features of this outbreak's epidemiology were inconsistent with past JE outbreaks. Remarkably, researchers noted that human case patients had an association with infected animals from a concurrent and severe outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs and that there was a notable absence of illness in children. Subsequently, serological testing coupled with epidemiological findings showed that the Malaysians were not dealing with JE. Tissue culture isolation eventually led them to the actual etiologic agent of the outbreak (Chua et al., 1999) . Nipah virus gets its name from the village (Sungai Nipah) where the first cases were reported. In March 1999 a related outbreak occurred in Singapore, where abattoir workers were exposed to swine imported from Malaysia. The outbreak was quickly identified and stamped out.",

What is thought to be the first outbreak of hantavirus causing HFRS was recorded in Russia in 1913. It is reported that Japanese troops in Manchuria experienced cases in 1932. In the early 1950s Western physicians recorded more than 3200 cases of an acute, debilitating, febrile illness in UN forces fighting in the Korean War. The illness, known as Korean hemorrhagic fever, affected soldiers living out of foxholes along the contested border between North and South Korea (Ricketts, 1954) . Because the mortality rate was high (10-15%), the US Army Medical Department formed the Hemorrhagic Fever Commission to conduct an epidemiological investigation. Results of the commission indicated that a field mouse (Apodemus agrarius coreae) was harboring the infectious agent. However, it was not until 1977 that the infectious agent was isolated and named Hantaan for the river that runs near the 38th parallel, which separates North and South Korea . The Hemorrhagic Fever Commission preserved more than 600 serum samples from 245 soldiers. Later, in 1990, the serum samples from these 245 soldiers were screened for antibody to the Hantaan virus. Almost 40 years after the outbreak, investigators detected an antibody to Hantaan virus in 94% of the samples. In 1979 a virus similar to Hantaan caused hemorrhagic fever in laboratory workers. This virus, named Seoul virus after the site of the initial studies, infected Norway rats and roof rats shipped to Japan and Europe. Shipping these laboratory animals led to the dissemination of the Seoul virus.",

As the outbreak spread, cases were distributed around the Four Corners region of the United States (Chapman and Khabbaz, 1994) . The region gets its name from the perfectly formed grid square that marks the boundaries among the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. These cases, later described as HPS, were attributed to a new species of hantavirus. Actually, nothing was new about it. The virus had probably been in the region for many years but had not been the cause of so much notable human illness in the past. Several young Navajo tribal members presented to the Indian Health Service physicians with sudden onset of respiratory failure in May 1993. By June of that year, 12 people had succumbed to the illness. The illness was initially diagnosed as unexplained acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients presented with abrupt fever, severe headache, myalgia, and cough followed by rapidly progressive pulmonary edema (Stelzel, 1996) . Within 2-10 days, this condition led to respiratory failure, hypotension, and death. New Mexico Public Health officials teamed with CDC investigators to set up surveillance and laboratory testing. The team found that serum from the patients showed crossreactive antibodies to Hantaan, Seoul, and Puumala virus antigens. However, the condition in these patients had developed into a pulmonary form unlike any other clinical presentation of hantavirus infection. The investigation also focused on the wildlife and domestic animals in the area of the outbreak (Calisher et al., 1999) . Epidemiologists were quick to discover that the virus was being spread through the dried feces and urine of Peromyscus mice. Unfortunately, the Navajo believe that mice are responsible for bringing seeds to the earth, which enables humans to survive. The fact that mice are highly respected in Navajo culture made disease control efforts difficult. Tribal members had to accept all forms of rodent population management efforts, which include trapping, housecleaning, and reduction of harborage.",

Conversely, heavy snowfall and spring rains allow plants to flourish and rodent populations to surge. These surges in the rodent population cause rodents to compete for food and protection in the dryer months that follow. The competition puts pressure on some infected rodents, forcing them into peridomestic environments, putting more people at risk for infection. HPS is most common in spring and summer months, when rodents are most active. Although the overall risk for HPS in endemic areas is relatively low, infections are associated with an increased population of rodents in and around the house. Activities that put people in contact with rodent droppings, urine, or nesting materials place the individual at higher risk for infection. Indoor exposures have been linked to rodents in the home or near dwellings, especially in colder months. Cleaning buildings that have been closed up for a period of time, such as cabins, barns, and storage facilities, also increases the risk of exposure.",

Very rarely, a bite from an infected rodent may cause disease. Person-to-person transmission of hantaviruses have not been reported. Several laboratory-acquired cases of HFRS have been reported.

However, as with all blood donation screening, infections can be transmitted to transfusion recipients on rare occasions despite negative donor test results. Although WNV transmission by blood transfusion is rare, the few cases seen since 2002 underscore the importance of clinical recognition, effective WNV blood screening strategies, and investigation coordination (Pealer et al., 2003) .",

It can be characterized as an area dotted with industrial complexes surrounded by fertile farmlands, where people work and live in close proximity to their animals. Animals are an important part of life in Guangdong. In fact, much of South China is known for its live animal markets. In this region, the Chinese believe that eating freshly killed wild animals promotes vitality and good health. In the live animal markets, you may purchase cats, dogs, snakes, bats, and civets. Once you make your purchase the animal is butchered for the customer to take home. SARS is believed to have developed here in the live markets or farm settings of Guangdong province. On November 16, 2002, a 45-year-old man in Foshan, a Guangdong city of 3.4 million, became ill with an unusual respiratory illness (Knobler et al., 2004) . No one knows exactly where or how he contracted the illness. He had no travel history, but he had recently prepared chicken, cat, and snake for household meals. An epidemiological investigation showed that many of the earliest SARS case patients had possible associations with the use of wild animal food sources. The man, a local leader in the province, was married with four children. Within weeks, his wife, a niece, an aunt, and her husband also became ill (Xu et al., 2004) . The initial case patient and his four family members are thought to have been the first cluster of a disease that infected 8096 people around the world and killed 774 before ebbing in the summer of 2003 (9.5% case-fatality rate). Guangdong was especially hard-hit, accounting for more than 1500 probable cases and 58 deaths.",

A febrile illness caused by Nipah virus, a virus in the genus Henipavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. Henipaviruses are characterized by their large size, natural occurrence in Pteropid fruit bats, and recent emergence as zoonotic pathogens capable of causing illness and death in domestic animals and humans. \u2022 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Caused by MERS-coronavirus, MERS first appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012, but it is thought to have originated from Jordan that same year. Similar to SARS, it causes severe respiratory disease and pneumonia with a high mortality rate. All outbreaks of this emerging disease can be traced back to the Arabian Peninsula. \u2022 Severe Acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS is an atypical form of pneumonia. It first appeared in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. SARS is caused by the SARS coronavirus, a novel coronavirus. \u2022 West Nile fever. A febrile illness caused by West Nile virus, which is transmitted from birds to people through the bite of an infected Culex mosquito.
