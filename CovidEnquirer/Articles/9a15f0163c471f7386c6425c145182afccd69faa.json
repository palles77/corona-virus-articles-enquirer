We need new drugs, vaccines, rapid diagnostic methods and to husband the current drugs. There needs to be greater emphasis on appropriate use, dampening of scare tactics by media and promotion by the pharmaceutical industry. Charles Darwin foresaw these evolutionary events in 1859 in the \"'On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection\". Paul Ehrlich, the Father of Chemotherapy in his 1908 Nobel Lecture, described trypanosomes that became multiply resistant to arsenicals and emergence of resistance during therapy. Alexander Fleming, in his 1945 Nobel Lecture, warned about development of resistance from over-the-counter purchase of penicillin.",

The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may ... underdose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities ... make them resistant. Here is a hypothetical illustration. Mr. X. has a sore throat. He buys some penicillin and gives himself, not enough to kill the streptococci but enough to ... resist penicillin. He then infects his wife. Mrs. X gets pneumonia and is treated with penicillin. As the streptococci are now resistant to penicillin the treatment fails. Mrs. X dies. Who is primarily responsible for Mrs. X's death? Moral: If you use penicillin, use enough.'\" Fleming was remarkably prescient. In the 1950s Ernest Jawetz ( The crisis of resistance finally became evident to policy-making organizations during the last decade. Finally, in 1999 the CDC became the lead organization to develop a public health plan to combat antimicrobial resistance. It developed an excellent 12 step action plan. The WHO also published a well-reasoned Global Strategy for Containment of Antibiotic Resistance in 2001. The message has finally gotten through.",

Despite intensive control measures being implemented, it is unlikely that dengue can be successfully controlled. Even in Singapore with its stricter control measures, the dengue situation last year was the worst in the last decade. In Malaysia, an outbreak of chikungunya polyaxthritis was thought to be due to the importation of the virus by migrant workers and the disease has become endemic due to the abundance of Aedes aegspti mosquitoes [3] .

Heavy dependency on migrant workers in some countries will add to the burden of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis [4] . The increasing spread of HIV is attributed to intravenous drug use and sexual promiscuity. Due to cultural and religious sensitivities, control programmes involving needle exchange, sex education and condom usage are not actively promoted. The easy access to prescription drugs including antibiotics and the lack of antibiotic policy have led to resistant strains of bacteria such as methicillin-msistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The use of antibiotics in farm feeds is yet another contributory factor to bacteria resistance. Generally, good farming practice is the exception rather than the norm in the region. Intense mixed fanning has created an environment that allows inter species exchange of genetic materials. Backyard famls mid flee-range domestic animals such as chicken, ducks and pigs are common in Asia, further adding to the problem. The preference for freshly slaugfiteied poulti% the keeping of fighting cocks and the gastronomic delight in exotic meats have posed many problems in the control of avian influenza.",

In 1959 Finland described the need for new antibiotics to overcome resistant staphylococci and coliforms. In 1973 Kunin, Tupasi & Craig reported that about half of the time antibiotics were used inappropriately in hospitals because of an incorrect choice, dose or duration (Ann Intern Med 1973, 79:555). The Veterans Administration prepared 17 audit-guidelines for use of antibiotics (Kunin and Efron JAMA 1977, 237:1001-1002). An NIH symposium on problems of antibiotic usage was held in 1978 and published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. No action was taken because NIH did not consider this to be research. The Alliance for Prudent Use of Antibiotics was established in 1981. This led to establishment of task forces by the Fogarty Center of NIH in 1983-1986. The findings were published and forgotten. In 1983 WHO published a report on control of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but there was no follow through. The recommendations by Malt JJ, Moffett HL, Kunin CM, and Guidelines for improving the use of antimicrobial agents in hospitals (J Infect Dis 1988, 157:281-295) were considered to be Quixotic by the leadership of the IDSA.",

University of Natal, Durban, South Africa Introduction: Healtficare responses to the global HIV/AIDS pandemic can o/fly be fommlated on the basis of accurate information on the size, distribution mid epidemiology of the infection. The most reliable figures on global prevalence of H1V and of AIDS are those that are issued annually from UNAIDS/Wt-IO. These numbers are mainly estimated from the regular antenatal surveys conducted in the most affected countries. Population-based samples in a few countries, including South Africa, provide additional data. Both methods have their particular shortcomings. In general, the ANC figures appear to be higher than those that are population-based: the truth probably lies anmewfiere in between, and our searches for the nearest approximation must continue. The lack of absolute precision, as demanded by some critics, is not a mason for paralysis. In South Africa, considerable public confusion and much harm is done through persistent questioning by a few well-connected individuals of the accuracy of such prevalence figmes. The gulf between the South African state and civil society on HIV/AIDS, of which these continuing doubts on the size of the epidemic are but one illustration, will be discussed. This will be done in the context of emphasizing the centrality of political and government support complete, unconditional, and enthusiastic in the efforts to confront and control tiffs epidemic.Background: The current estimates indicate that there are 38 million people living with HIV and the epidemic continues to increase, with almost every region in the world being involved. Africa remains the worst affected; India, China, Eastern Europe, and the Carribbean countries have sizable epidemics. The target groups for whom appropriate interventions for prevention and care are desperately needed are women, adolescents, young adults, and those who live in poverty. In Kwazulu/Natal, South Africa, the prevalence of HIV among young women between the ages of 20 29 years attending antenatal clinics goes up to about 50%.Discussion: Heterosexual transmission is the main route of transmis sion. It has been estimated that for every 10 000 contacts there are 80 HIV infections for receptive anal sex, 20 for receptive vaginal sex, and 3 for insertive anal/vaginal sex. These figures are to be compared to 60 HIV itffections for needle sharing and 33 for occupational needle-stick injuiy per 10000 contacts. Sexually transmitted infections have been shown repeatedly to predispose to HIV infection. Prevention programs are a key challenge; of persons worldwide who require prevention services less than 20% have access to them. Prevention of motfier-to-child-transmission",
