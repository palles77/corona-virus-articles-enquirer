Studies have shown that demyelination during MHV-4 infection is a direct effect of virus infection of the oligodendrocyte (Weiner, 1973; Lampert et al, 1973; Knobler et aL, 1982) , an effect normally masked during acute infection when neuronal infection results in fulminant encephalomyelitis (Weiner, 1973; Stohlman and Weiner, 1981) . Despite elegant morphological studies from several laboratories (Weiner, 1973; Lampert et al, 1973; Nagashima et al, 1978; Sorensen et ah, 1980; Knobler et cd, 1982) , detailed understanding of the factors which influence virus-induced demyelination is still lacking.",

In addition to the N protein, the virion contains two glycoproteins termed El and E2 by Sturman and Holmes (1977) . A structural model for the incorporation of El and E2 into MHV virions has recently been proposed (Sturman et a& 1980; Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . The large glycoprotein E2 is associated with the virion peplomers, contains N-linked oligosaccharides, and is composed of at least two related polypeptides: 150-200K and 90-100K (Sturman and Holmes, 1977; Wege et al, 1979; Bond et or, 1979; Siddell, 1982 ). An intracellular 150K glycosylated precursor polypeptide has been described (Siddell et al, 1981; Siddell, 1982) with an apoprotein of llO-120K (Rottier et a& 1981) . The El glycoprotein contains O-linked oligosaccharides (Niemann and Klenk, 1981; Holmes et al, 1981) and appears to be embedded in the membrane. Available evidence suggests that El interacts with the internal N protein (Sturman et a& 1980) . In the virions, both glycosylated 23-26K and nonglycosylated 18-23K forms of the El protein exist (Wege et c& 1979; Siddell et al, 1981; Rottier et a& 1981) .",

Conjugates with lower EIA titers were added at higher concentration and their binding could be inhibited to a lesser extent by unconjugated homologous antibodies, thus decreasing the sensitivity of the assay. For that reason, some conjugates did not provide reliable probes in competition binding assays. Nevertheless, all the available antibodies were tested as unconjugated competing antibodies.

Based on our data and biological activities of the monoclonal antibodies studied, we were able to associate specific properties to these epitopes. Three nonoverlapping antigenic sites designated A(E2), B(E2), and C(E2) were defined on the E2 glycoprotein by four neutralizing antibodies. Sites B(E2) and C(E2) were identified by the binding of 5813.5 and 4B11.6, respectively. Two antibodies, 5B19.2 and 5B170.3, were both directed to site A(E2). Each competing pair was examined by reciprocal competition assays with both members in a combination conjugated in turn to minimize the effect of differing avidity (Stone and Nowinski, 1980) . These results presented an interesting paradox. Antibody 4B11.6 directed against site C(E2) neutralized virus efficiently in vitro but failed in other studies to protect mice against a lethal virus chalil\"HAP-581i0.3 bEi 6'1 pg lmmunoglobulin FIG. 5 .

These MAb were directed to two topographically distinct antigenic sites designated A(E2) and B(E2). This indicates the presence on E2 of multiple topographically distinct regions associated with virus attachment on the host cell. Preliminary studies indicate that antigenic variation at sites B(E2) and C(E2) can be detected in various MHV strains (Talbot and Buchmeier, unpublished, 1984) . These two antigenic sites may be conformationdependent determinants since their reactivity is lost after SDS denaturation and Western immunoblotting (Table 1) . We have made the assumption that antigenic sites A, B, and C(E2), all of which give rise to neutralizing antibodies, are freely accessible to the external milieu.",

            "text": "5B11.5 is less certain. Binding of these antibodies was only partially cross-inhibited and this may be due to steric hindrance rather than site specific competition as El is small (25K) relative to the IgG peroxidase probe (200K). Antibody 5B39.1 was shown to bind to the viral protein but did not affect the binding of the other antibodies. Its target epitope is thus likely distinct from epitopes A and B and C(El), although the absence of a reliable enzyme conjugate of 5B39.1 did not allow its definitive topographical assignment. Our studies further confirm the presence in infected cells of an approximately 150K precursor to the structural glycoprotein E2 (Wege et d, 1979; Siddell et aL, 1981) . Monoclonal antibodies to E2 also recognized a 1OOK monomer and high M, polypeptides as reported previously (Wege et aL, 1979; Siddell et al, 1981; Sturman and Holmes, 1983) .Studies of others on detergent-solubilized virions as well as the observation that approximately 80% of the El protein is protected from protease digestion have implied that El is a transmembranous protein interacting inside the virion with the nucleocapsid and may organize sites of virus maturation in the cell (Sturman and Holmes, 1977; Wege et al, 1979; Sturman et aL, 1980; Holmes et ah, 1981) . In contrast, E2 was completely digested by protease treatment and did not appear to be necessary for virus maturation since virus particles formed in the presence of tunicamycin lacked E2 peplomers (Holmes et uL, 1981) . Recently, E2 was shown to contain covalently attached fatty acid (Schmidt, 1982) , which is the only indication that a portion of this glycoprotein might be exposed to a hydrophobic environment. Therefore, current knowledge of MHV structure is consistent with the hypothesis that El may serve to anchor the E2 peplomers within the viral envelope (Sturman et aL, 1980) . The apparent stoiechiometric excess of El over E2 proteins (Sturman et d, 1980, Sturman and Holmes, 1983) would be explained if several El molecules formed a complex around an E2 stalk peripherally embedded in the membrane. This association would allow E2 to form hydrophobic domains by interaction with this El anchor. However, we have failed so far to obtain MAb directed against epitopes on the two viral glycoproteins which would be in close enough proximity to cause mutual steric hindrance in competition binding EIA. Our membrane-enriched antigen source presumably contains both plasma membranes and microsomal membranes thus obviating any speculation about the localization of the viral glycoproteins in this system. All competition binding EIA were consistent in the presence or absence of the nonionic detergent Tween 20 in the assay buffers. This eliminates the possibility of structural reorganizations induced by the detergent. Obviously, more precise structural studies are needed to define the molecular arrangement of these proteins.Monoclonal antibodies have proven to be sensitive probes to study the biology and structure of MHV-4 and we have used them to characterize biologically important antigenic regions of the viral glycoproteins. Studies are currently underway in our laboratory to examine the structural properties of these glycoproteins with the goal of better understanding the molecular basis of virus-induced demyelination.
