            "text": "Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is a relatively rare malignant tumor worldwide; however, in developing countries, it has a much higher incidence and accounts for up to 2% of malignancies in men. 1 The major risk factors mainly comprise human papilloma virus infection, phimosis, and poor hygiene. 2 The involvement of local lymph nodes (LNs) is the major prognostic factor in PSCC. [3] [4] [5] The main treatment for PSCC is currently a partial or radical penectomy with or without bilateral inguinal Dovepress Dovepress 2984 Zhou et al lymphadenectomy, along with radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. 1, [6] [7] [8] [9] Some classical serum biomarkers (such as CEA, AFP, PSA, and CA-199) are clinically useful in many cancers [10] [11] [12] ; however, they are not suitable in penile cancer. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) were reported to be prognostic markers in PSCC. [13] [14] [15] However, large-scale investigations are required to assess the clinical application of these markers. The discovery of more serologic biomarkers would be helpful in guiding treatment and predicting prognosis in PSCC.",

Briefly, 4-\u03bcm-thick formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by antigen retrieval and endogenous peroxidase inactivation. 20, 21 After blocking, the slides were incubated with LAMC2 (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) or E-cadherin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology [CST], Danvers, MA, USA), followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (CST), and were then visualized using a peroxidase Envision kit (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). All slides were independently evaluated by two pathologists to determine the percentage of cancer cells with positive staining. Cells with cytoplasmic staining were considered to be positive for LAMC2, while cells with membrane staining were positive for E-cadherin ( Figure S1 ). According to the definitions used in previous reports, a high level of LAMC2 expression in tumor tissues (tLAMC2) was defined as more than 30% of the tumor cells staining positive for LAMC2, 17, 22 while a low level of E-cadherin expression was defined as less than 90% of the tumor cells staining positive for E-cadherin. 23 Reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) LAMC2 mRNA levels in tumor tissues were detected by RT-qPCR. Briefly, total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed using PrimeScript TM Master Mix (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), and quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR \u00ae Premix Ex Taq TM (TaKaRa) with specific primers (Table S2 ). The relative expression of genes is presented as 2 \u2212\u0394Ct (normalized against GAPDH expression). 24 WB was performed as previously described 26, 27 to analyze protein levels in cells and frozen tissues. Briefly, protein samples were routinely extracted, quantified, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with LAMC2-(Sigma-Aldrich Co.), E-cadherin-, N-cadherin-, ZEB-1-, ZO-1-, vimentin-, or GAPDH-specific antibodies (CST) (1:1000-2000), followed by incubation with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (CST).

Although serum CRP and SCC-Ag levels have been reported to predict postoperative recurrence, progression, and prognosis in PSCC, [13] [14] [15] their prognostic values need to be validated by large-scale investigations.

These results may be in accordance with the lower HRs for tLAMC2, SCC-Ag, or CRP compared to those for N stage, pathologic grade, and sLAMC2 (Table S4) . Thus, we speculate that sLAMC2 is a more important predictive factor for survival in PSCC patients than SCC-Ag and CRP, which have been previously reported to be potential predictive factors in PSCC patients. In particular, the stratification analysis revealed that sLAMC2 level showed more predictive value for DSS in patients with early-stage penile cancer (such as patients at the N 0/X stage). However, due to the lower number of patients at the T 3/4 stage in our analysis, we cannot conclude that sLAMC2 level showed more predictive value in early T-stage penile cancer, and this finding needs to be further investigated in a large cohort.",
