            "text": "Computer-assisted tools in drug design and discovery, with an incredible modernization of computational resources, are very much appreciated throughout the world. Both ligandand structure-based approaches are increasingly being used for the design of small lead and druglike molecules with anticipated multitarget activities [1] . Various ligand-based methods have been developed for effective and comprehensive application in virtual screening (VS), de novo design, and lead optimization. Pharmacophore has become one of the major ligand-based tools in computational chemistry for the drug research and development process [2] . Again, molecular recognitions, including enzyme\u00c0substrate, drug\u00c0protein, drug\u00c0nucleic acid, protein\u00c0nucleic acid, and protein\u00c0protein interactions, play significant roles in many biological responses. As a consequence, identification of the binding mode and affinity of the drug molecule is crucial to understanding the underlying mechanism of action in the respective therapeutic response. In this perspective, structure-based drug design is always a front-runner among all the available drug design approaches. Molecular docking is one of the largely acclaimed structure-based approaches, widely used for the study of molecular recognition, which aims to predict the binding mode and binding affinity of a complex formed by two or more constituent molecules with known structures [3] .",

The VS approach is used for computationally prioritizing drug candidate molecules for future synthesis by using certain filters. The filters may be created by employing knowledge about the protein target (in structure-based VS) or known bioactive ligands (in ligand-based VS). These computational methods are powerful tools, as they supply a straightforward way to estimate the properties of the molecules and establish them as probable drug candidates from a huge number of compounds in no time in a cost-effective way. A combination of bioinformatics and chemoinformatics is crucial to the success of VS of chemical libraries, which is an alternative and complementary approach to high-throughput screening (HTS) in the lead discovery process [7] . Simply stated, the VS attempts to improve the probability of identifying bioactive molecules by maximizing the true positive rate-that is, by ranking the truly active molecules as high as possible.",

The pharmacophore technique in modern drug discovery is extremely useful as an interface between the medicinal chemistry and computational chemistry, both in VS and library design for efficient hit discovery, as well as in the optimization of lead compounds to final drug candidates.

The types of ligand molecules and the size and diversity of the data set have a great impact on the resulting pharmacophore model. Although a pharmacophore model signifies the key interactions between a ligand and its biological target, neither the structure of the target nor its identity is required to construct a handy pharmacophore model. As a consequence, pharmacophore approaches are often considered to be vital when the accessible information is very restricted. For example, when one knows nothing more than the structures of active ligands, a pharmacophore is the answer.",

This conformational search can be divided into four categories: (i) systematic search in the torsional space, (ii) clustering (if wanted or needed), (iii) stochastic methods, such as Monte Carlo (MC), sampling, and Poling, and (iv) molecular dynamics [15] . Commonly employed conformational search methods are BEST, FAST, and conformer algorithms based on energy screening and recursive buildup (CAESAR) [16] , all of which generate conformations that provide broad coverage of the accessible conformational space. The FAST conformation generation method searches conformations only in the torsion space and takes less time. The BEST method provides a complete and improved coverage of conformational space by performing a rigorous energy minimization and optimizing the conformations in both torsional and Cartesian space using the Poling algorithm. CAESAR is based on a divide-and-conquer and recursive conformation approach. This approach is also combined in cases of local rotational symmetry so that conformation duplicates due to topological symmetry in a systematic search can be efficiently eliminated.",

This is done by scrambling the activity data of the training set molecules and assigning them new values, followed by the generation of pharmacophore hypotheses using the same features and parameters as those used to develop the original pharmacophore hypothesis. The original hypothesis is considered to be generated by mere chance if the randomized data set results in the generation of a pharmacophore with better or nearly equal correlation compared to the original one. Test set prediction: The purpose of the pharmacophore hypothesis generation is not only to predict the activity of the training set compounds [21] , but also to predict the activities of external molecules. With the objective of verifying whether the pharmacophore is able to predict the activity of test set molecules in agreement with the experimentally determined value, the activities of the test set molecules are estimated based on the mapping of the test set molecules to the developed pharmacophore model. The conformers are generated for the test set molecules based on the method that is used during the conformer generation of the training set, and they are mapped using the corresponding pharmacophore models. Thus, the predictive capacity of the models is judged based on the predictive R 2 values (R 2 pred with a threshold value of 0.5) or classification-based methods (such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy). The test set should cover similar structural diversity as the training set in order to establish the broadness of the pharmacophore predictability. GH scoring: The GH scoring method is employed following test set validation to evaluate the quality of the pharmacophore models [22\u00c024] . The GH score can be successfully applied to quantify model selectivity precision of hits and the recall of actives from a directory of useful decoys (DUD) data set [25] consisting of known actives and inactives. The DUD is a publicly available database for free use, generated based on the observation that physical characteristics of the decoy background can be used for the classification of different compounds. The DUD can be downloaded from http://dud.docking.org. The method involves evaluation of the following: the percent yield of actives in a database (%Y, recall), the percent ratio of actives in the hit list (%A, precision), the enrichment factor E, and the GH score. The GH score ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 signifies the ideal model. The following are the metrics used for analyzing hit lists by a pharmacophore model\u00c0based database search: In these equations, %A is the percentage of known active compounds retrieved from the database (precision); Ha is the number of actives in the hit list (true positives); A is the number of active compounds in the database; %Y is the percentage of known actives in the hit list (recall); Ht is the number of hits retrieved; D is the number of compounds in the database; and E is the enrichment of the concentration of actives by the model relative to random screening without any pharmacophoric approach.",

In the case of LBP modeling, pharmacophore generation from multiple ligands involves two major steps: First, creation of the conformational space for each ligand in the training set to represent conformational flexibility of the ligands and to align the multiple ligands in the training set, and second, determination of the essential common chemical features to build the pharmacophore model. The conformational analysis of ligands and performing molecular alignment are the key techniques as well as the main complexities in any LBP modeling.

The first is the preenumerating method, in which multiple conformations for each ligand are precomputed and saved in a database [28] . The advantage of this approach is lower computing cost for conducting molecular alignment at the expense of a possible need for a mass storage capacity. The second approach is the on-the-fly method, in which the conformation analysis is carried out in the pharmacophore modeling process [28] . This approach does not need mass storage but might need higher central processing unit (CPU) time for conducting meticulous optimization. It has been demonstrated that the preenumerating method outperforms the on-the-fly calculation approach [29] . Recently, a considerable number of advanced algorithms [14] have been established to sample the conformational spaces of small molecules, which are listed in Table 10 .1. Most importantly, a good conformation generator should ensure the following conditions: (i) proficiently generating all the putative bound conformations that small molecules adopt when they interact with macromolecules, (ii) keeping the list of low-energy conformations as short as possible to avoid the combinational explosion problem, and (iii) being less time consuming for the conformational calculations. b. Molecular alignment is the second issue of concern in LBP modeling. The alignment methods can be classified into two approaches in terms of their elementary nature: point-based and property-based [29] . The points of the point-based method can be further discriminated as atoms, fragments, or chemical features [30] . In the point-based algorithms, pairs of atoms, fragments, or chemical feature points are usually superimposed employing a least-squares fitting. The major disadvantage of this approach is the requirement for predefined anchor points because the generation of these points can become problematic in the case of different ligands. Consequently, the property-based algorithms utilize molecular field descriptors, generally represented by sets of Gaussian functions, to generate alignments. Recently, new alignment methods have been developed, including stochastic proximity embedding [31] , atomic property fields [32] , fuzzy pattern recognition [33] , and grid-based interaction energies [34] . c. The third challenge lies in the appropriate selection of training set compounds.",

As the number of experimentally determined 3D structure of targets has grown to a very large number, SBP methods have attracted significant interest in the last decade. The approach is considered as the complementary one to the docking procedures, providing the same level of information as well as less demanding with respect to required computational resources. The protocol of SBP modeling involves analyzing the complementary chemical features of the active site and their spatial relationships, and developing a pharmacophore model assembly with selected features [2] . SBP modeling can be further classified into two subclasses: macromolecule\u00c0 ligand\u00c0complex based and macromolecule (without ligand) based. The macromolecule\u00c0 ligand\u00c0complex-based approach is suitable in identifying the ligand binding site of the macromolecular target and determining the key interaction points between ligands and the target protein. LigandScout [35] is an excellent software program that incorporates the macromolecule\u00c0ligand\u00c0complex-based scheme. Programs like Pocket v.2 [36] and GBPM [37] are based on the same approach. The major limitation of this process is the requirement for the 3D structure of the macromolecule\u00c0ligand complex. As a consequence, it cannot be applied to cases when no ligands targeting the binding site of interest are known. This can be solved by the macromolecule-based approach. The SBP method implemented in the Discovery Studio software [18] is a typical example of a macromolecule-based approach [38] .",

In simpler words, the screening results produce a higher false-positive rate, a higher false-negative rate, or both. Many factors like the quality and composition of the pharmacophore model and the macromolecular target information can contribute to this problem. The most probable factors are as follows: a. The most critical one is the development of a robust and reliable pharmacophore hypothesis. Addressing this issue requires an inclusive validation and optimization of the pharmacophore model. b. Different molecules can be retrieved in VS from different hypotheses of a single pharmacophore model, which is probably an important reason for the higher false-positive/false-negative rates in some studies. c. The flexibility of target macromolecule in pharmacophore approaches is handled by introducing a tolerance radius for each pharmacophoric feature, which is unlikely to entirely account for macromolecular flexibility in some cases. Recent attempts [46] to integrate molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) into pharmacophore modeling have recommended that the pharmacophore models generated from MDS trajectories explain the considerably enhanced representation of the flexibility of pharmacophores. d. The steric restriction by the macromolecular target which is not adequately considered in pharmacophore models, although it is partially accounted for by the consideration of excluded volumes. In most of the cases, interactions between a ligand and a protein are distance-sensitive, particularly the short-range interactions, such as the electrostatic interaction, which a pharmacophore model is tricky to account for. As a consequence, the combination of pharmacophore-based and docking-based VS can be considered as an efficient approach for VS.",

In general, the higher the resolution (preferably ,2 \u00c5 ) of the employed crystal structure, the better the observed docking results are. Another important criterion for examining the quality of a receptor structure is Debye\u00c0Waller factor (DWF), or B-factor; or the temperature factor, which is used to describe the attenuation of X-ray scattering or coherent neutron scattering caused by thermal motion. It signifies the relative vibrational motion of different parts of the protein. Atoms with low B-factors belong to a part of the structure that is well ordered, and atoms with large B-factors generally belong to part of the structure that is very flexible. As a consequence, it is important to ensure that the B-factors of the atoms in the binding site region are logical, as high values imply that their coordinates are less reliable. Identification of the bound-ligand in the cocrystal structure and the knowledge about its interaction with the corresponding protein's amino acid residues are very important before starting a docking study.",

In that case, most commonly applied techniques are \"threading\" and \"homology modeling\" [54, 55] . In the case of threading or the fold recognition technique, an estimation is made whether a given amino acid sequence is compatible with one of the ligands in a database. On the other hand, homology or comparative modeling relies on a correlation or homology between the sequence of the target protein and at least one known structure. Correct homology models can be generated, provided that the sequence identity of a given target sequence is .50% to a known structure template. Modest homology model building efforts could potentially create receptor structures for entire target families. Importantly, homology modeling is a comparatively economical method for generating a diversity of receptor conformations using either single-template or multiple-template structures enhancing the understanding of selectivity.",

Among these, protein\u00c0ligand docking is a common research area because of its importance to structure-based drug design [3] .

The method allows for a small degree of overlap between the ligand and the protein through the use of additional energy terms-usually interatomic van der Waals (VDW)-in the empirical scoring function [60] . The advantages of soft docking are its computational competence and easiness for implementation. It is important to remember that soft docking can account for only minute conformational changes.

Thereafter, the formed complexes are relaxed or minimized by MC, MDS, or other methods [65] .

These methods are now regularly used to examine the structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics of biological molecules and their complexes. The advantage of the molecular relaxation method is the addition of certain backbone flexibility in addition to the side-chain conformational changes.

In spite of its sampling totality for ligand conformations, the number of the choices can be huge due to an increase in the number of rotatable bonds. As a consequence, to make the docking process realistic, geometric and chemical constraints are normally applied to the initial screening of ligand poses, and the filtered ligand conformations are further subject to the more precise refinement and optimization measures. b. Fragmentation approach: The basic idea behind this approach is that the ligand is first divided into a number of fragments. Then, the ligand-binding conformation is grown by placing one fragment at a time in the binding site or by docking all the fragments into the binding site and linking them covalently. c. Conformational ensemble: In the conformational ensemble methods [69] , ligand flexibility is achieved by rigidly docking an ensemble of pregenerated ligand conformations with other programs (e.g., OMEGA).

Protein preparation: Hydrogen atoms should be added and the protein must be minimized using software-specific FF, followed by the removal of water molecules except in the active site. The protein should be adjusted by fixing any serious errors like incomplete residues near the active site. The charges and atom types for any metal atoms should be set properly, if needed. If there are bonds to metal ions, the bonds should be deleted, followed by adjusting the formal charges of the atoms that were attached to the metal, as well as the metal itself. The protein molecule, thus prepared, is the total receptor ready for docking. c. Ligand\u00c0protein docking: After ensuring that protein and ligands are in the correct form for docking, in a few cases the receptor grid files are generated using a grid\u00c0 receptor generation program for grid-based docking. The grid box is generally generated at the centroid of the ligand bound to the active site of the receptor. In other cases, active pockets of the protein are identified to dock the prepared ligand in those identified pockets. Initially, all the molecules of the data set should be docked into the active site of the protein and the interaction energies between each ligand and the receptor can be calculated. The obtained results are then needed to be compared with those of the bound ligand of the crystallized protein structure in order to assess whether the molecules fit into the specified active site of the receptor or not. A set number of ligand poses should be saved for each conformation of the ligand. A predefined number of docking poses thus saved for each conformation of the compound can be ranked according to their dock score function, and then their interaction with the receptor can be analyzed. From the docking studies, the receptor\u00c0ligand interactions are correlated with the biological activity of the data set compounds. The structural validation of the docking procedure is done by extracting the cocrystallized ligand from the active site of the receptor and redocking it to the receptor to ensure that it binds to the same active site and interacts with the same amino acid residues as before. The basic steps are schematically illustrated in Figure 10 .9.",

This section presents some of the primary challenges and the required improvements that will advance the performance of docking and scoring [79] . Challenges: a. Water molecules in protein: Water molecules often play a significant role in pro-tein\u00c0ligand interaction. If water-mediated interactions during docking is ignored, the estimated interaction energy of a given ligand conformation may be too low. On the contrary, if one holds water molecules present in the crystal protein structure, then the binding pose and affinity of a ligand will not be reliable. Thus, it is very difficult to treat the water molecules effectively. To perform reliable and acceptable docking, one first need to recognize probable positions for water molecules where they could interact with the protein and ligand, and subsequently, one must be capable to predict whether a water molecule is indeed present at that position. b. Tautomers and protomers: Another significant challenge with docking is consideration for the various tautomeric and protomeric states that the molecules can adopt. Most of the time, molecules such as acids or amines are stored in their neutral forms. As they are ionized under physiological conditions, it is essential to ionize them prior to docking. Although ionization is easy to attain, but the problem of tautomer generation is already much more difficult, as other questions will arise, such as: Which tautomer should one use? Should one use more than one or all possible tautomers for a given molecule? Not only tautomers, but also different ionization states of ligands provide real challenges in docking. is the application of MASC, a simple statistical correction [81] . The scoring functions prefer certain ligand types or characteristics, such as large or hydrophobic ligands. As a consequence, some ligands are predicted to be good binders regardless of whether these ligands will bind to specific active sites. Therefore, MASC has been introduced, which can be interpreted either as a statistical measure of ligand specificity or as a correction for ligand-related bias in the scoring function. In order to calculate the MASC scores, each ligand is docked into a number of unrelated binding sites of different binding site characteristics. The corrected score (or MASC score) S 0 ij for ligand molecule i in binding site j is calculated as follows:",

Thus, the MASC score S 0 ij represents a measure of specificity of molecule i for binding site j compared to the other binding sites. e. Docking with constraints: By introducing a constraint during docking, it is feasible to control the way the poses are generated and the ones that are preferentially set aside. For example, in the case of the DockIt program [82] , one can apply distance constraints between the ligand and protein that are consequently utilized during pose generation via a distance geometry approach. f. Postprocessing: There are two approaches of postprocessing that can be employed in the case of a docking study: (i) applying postdock filters and (ii) using tailormade rescoring functions. The postdock filters are theoretically simple and may correspond to certain geometric criteria, like the existence of certain interactions (e.g., a hydrogen bond with a selected residue or a polar interaction) or the filling of a specified pocket in the active site. Again, all scoring functions may exhibit biased behavior with certain compound classes or functional groups. To diminish the impact of this difficulty and to decrease the statistical noise, composite scoring, or rescoring methods have been introduced [83] . Rather than using a single scoring function, several scoring functions are merged such that in order to be classified as a potential binder, a molecule has to be scored well by a number of different scoring functions. Another way of postprocessing is to use the docking results as input to develop a Bayesian model with the aim of reducing the numbers of false positives and false negatives [84] .",

Measurement of the interaction energies: The objective of this step is the computation of the nonbonded (VDW and electrostatic) interaction energies between each residue of the receptor and every fragment of the ligand, using a molecular mechanics FF. Along with the interaction energies, the energies between all pairs of residues/ fragments for the complexes and for the free ligands and receptor on the basis of the distance-based dielectric constant should be computed as well. Finally, a matrix will be formed, with columns representing the energy components and rows representing each compound in the set. A final column containing experimental activities or inhibitory activities or binding affinities is then added to the matrix as the dependent variable for model development. c. Chemometric analysis: After the completion of steps 1 and 2, significant descriptors should be retained and others must be eliminated from the study matrix. Due to the large number of variables and their intercorrelation nature, partial least squares (PLS) is the technique of choice for deriving the QSAR model that can quantify the most important energy interactions in terms of activity prediction [87, 88] .",

First, to execute COMBINE analysis, each of the ligands against a particular target has to be docked into its target. It requires a training set of docked and optimized ligand\u00c0receptor complexes, and the unbound ligands and receptor for which intermolecular and intramolecular interaction energies are calculated. The calculated descriptors are then correlated with the experimental activity of the studied compounds to develop a QSAR model. Finally, the interpretation of the developed mathematical equation can enlighten the important ligand\u00c0receptor interactions for future drug designing and development process. gCOMBINE: gCOMBINE is an user-friendly tool for performing COMBINE analysis in drug design research programs. It is a graphical user interface (GUI) written in Java with the purpose of performing COMBINE analysis on a set of ligand\u00c0receptor complexes with the intention of deriving highly informative QSAR models [93] . The objective of this method is to generate the ligand\u00c0receptor interaction energies into a series of variables, explore the origins of the variance within the set employing principal component analysis (PCA), and then allocate weights to the chosen ligand\u00c0residue interactions by using PLS analysis to correlate with the experimental activities or binding affinities. The major advantages of using a GUI are that it allows plenty of interactivity and provides multiple plots representing the energy descriptors entering the analysis, scores, loadings, experimental versus predicted regression lines, and the evolution of classical validation parameters. Using the GUI, one can carry out numerous added tasks, such as possible truncation of positive interaction energy values and generation of ready-made PDB files containing information related to the importance of the activity of individual protein residues. This information can be aptly displayed and color-coded using a molecular graphics program like PyMOL.",

One has to remember that antibiotics fall outside the scope of this rule. b. ADMET filter: In addition to the Lipinski's filter, ADMET filters [102] can be employed for filtering. To get the early information regarding absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME), and toxicity data (ADMET data), the ADMET filter screen is very useful. The late stage failure of the molecules in the clinical trials is primarily attributed to their inability to meet the necessary pharmacokinetic profile. Accurate prediction of ADMET properties enables to eliminate unwanted molecules and aids the lead optimization process.",

            "text": "The ultimate screening step of the VS of the filtered druglike compounds is based on two fundamental approaches; namely, a ligand-based approach and a receptor-based approach [103] . a. Ligand-based approach: In this approach, molecules with physical and chemical properties similar to those of the known ligands are identified using QSAR models, pharmacophore-based search, substructure search, and 2D and 3D atomic property-based search approaches. The ligand-based approach is possible without protein information and can be employed for scaffold hopping. Again, since this technique is biased by the properties of known ligands, it limits the diversity of the hits generated. b. Receptor-based approach: The approach uses techniques like protein\u00c0ligand docking, different scoring functions, and active-site-directed SBPs for the molecular recognition between a ligand and a target protein to select chemical entities that bind to the active sites of biologically relevant targets with known 3D structures. The major advantages of this approach are the following: It is possible to carry out this process without ligand information, the entire capability of the protein pocket is taken into account, prediction of binding modes is possible, scaffold hopping and profiling without any bias toward existing ligands can be done. c. Combination of ligand-and receptor-based approach: As there is no universal method for the VS, one can use ligand-and structure-based methods separately (e.g., pharmacophore and docking one by one as a two-layer technique), or can employ the combined ligand-and structure-based methods like COMBINE and CoRIA. The COMBINE and CoRIA approaches are reliable. as they consider the ligand and receptor information as well as information regarding their binding complexes. d. Machine learning techniques: Apart from the ligand-and receptor-based approaches, machine learning techniques like support vector machine (SVM) and binary kernel discrimination (BKD) can be tactfully applied in a few cases of VS. The SVM predicts the bioactivity by representing the lead in n-dimensional real space using molecular descriptors and fingerprint technology, where n represents the number of features or attributes. The SVM approach is based on the fuzzy logic fingerprint. The BKD is a recently developed computational approach. In BKD, the molecule is represented as 2D fragment bit-string. It consists of three components. First, the structural representation section; second, the similarity searching section using different coefficients; and third, the section with different weighting schemes for lead compounds.",

Those water-mediated hydrogen bonds can be taken into account in a structure-based VS study, but it is very difficult to predict the exact number, position, and orientation of these interactions. \u2022 Single-versus allosteric-binding pockets: Both structure-and ligand-based VS approaches have intrinsic limitations, in that they are incapable of identifying bioactive ligands for the binding pockets, which are not explicitly docked against or implicitly represented in the training set. Again, the unknown binding site of a ligand complicates the problem of properly assessing hit rates in the VS experiments. \u2022 Prospective validation: The VS is habitually performed on data sets with known actives, but often only putatively inactive molecules. As a result, in many cases, a good number of inactive molecules are absent to identify the true inactives after the VS approach. \u2022 Druglikeness: The majority of the VS approaches are based on the screening of druglike compounds by employing Lipinski's rule of five as the preliminary screening steps of the VS. One should remember that the rule applies only to oral bioavailability, and that many bioactivity classes such as antibiotics fall outside the scope of this rule.

As a consequence, there is a huge risk of experimental errors and inappropriate assays from molecule to molecule. \u2022 Bad (reactive/aggregating) molecules: The data set provided for VS often includes molecules that contain chemically reactive groups or other undesirable functionalities that may interfere with the HTS detection techniques. \u2022 Putative inactive compounds as decoys: Experimentally confirmed inactive compounds are helpful as negative controls because only few of them should appear in the hit list when a reliable VS protocol is employed.

There is a high possibility of getting distorted information, like changes in atomic coordinates, chirality, hybridization, and protonation states of the employed compounds. \u2022 Improper feature definitions in the pharmacophore: Incorrect feature definitions can be detrimental to the outcome of VS. In pharmacophore queries, the definition of pharmacophore features needs to be applied with caution. For example, it is known that nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the same heterocycle (such as an oxazole) do not both behave as HBAs simultaneously. In the majority of cases, the acceptor in the oxazole ring is the nitrogen. \u2022 Disparity of algorithm from software to software: Various software tools apply different algorithms for a particular job. For example, in the case of docking for energy minimization, different forms of FFs are applied from one software to another. Therefore, there is a high probability of getting different hits and making the VS process highly dependent on the use of particular software. \u2022 Single predictors versus ensembles: Multiple statistical tools (both free and commercial software and descriptors) are available to perform VS studies. Each module captures different characteristics of molecular similarity. As a consequence, it is always difficult to identify a preferred tool/software/descriptor; therefore, it is often necessary to account for several approaches rather than one. d.

Few conformational sampling approaches do not utilize energy minimization to refine and properly rank the resulting geometries. Therefore, the resulting list could contain many false positives. \u2022 Ligand and protein flexibility: A common practice in many 3D database search systems is to set a limit on the number of conformations stored for each molecule. The number of conformations accessible to a molecule depends greatly on its size and flexibility. Of course, it is not only the ligands that are flexible; it is the biological targets as well. Protein flexibility is probably the most unexploited aspect of VS. \u2022 Assumption of ligand overlap: In 3D shape-based VS, most programs attempt to maximize the overlap between the query and the database molecules. Indeed, different ligands may occupy different regions in the same protein, even in the same binding site, and the overlap between them in 3D space can be much less than assumed by a shape-based VS tool, resulting in more false negatives.",

On the contrary, the docking method provides an opportunity for the designing of active compounds considering the binding aspects of the ligand with the amino acid residues in the respective receptors. Methods like CoRIA and COMBINE provide a blend of ligand-and structure-based drug design at once, where the best possible interactions of the ligand\u00c0receptor complex can be identified.

Thus far, the most commonly used docking algorithms use the rigid receptor/flexible ligand model. Here, we have categorized the protein\u00c0ligand docking in terms of the three most important aspects: (i) protein flexibility, (ii) ligand sampling, and (iii) scoring function, as illustrated in Figure 10.7.10.3.4.1 Receptor/protein flexibility Ligand binding usually induces protein conformational changes (ranging from local rearrangements of side-chains to large domain motions) or induced fit (Figure 10.8) upon ligand binding in order to maximize energetically favorable interactions with the ligand[57]. The algorithm behind the most induced-fit mechanisms is hydrophobic interaction or hydrophobic collapse of the receptor around the bound ligand[58]. Due to the large size and many degrees of freedom of proteins, their flexibility is one of the most challenging issues in molecular docking. There are varying degrees of receptor flexibility. The degree of flexibility that one could incorporate in a given experiment is directly proportional to computational complexity and cost. The protein flexibility can be grouped into four major categories: (i) soft docking, (ii) sidechain flexibility, (iii) molecular relaxation, and (iv) protein ensemble docking[59].10.3.4.1.1 Soft dockingSoft docking is the simplest approach, which considers protein flexibility in absolute terms.

Numerous examples have become known where the same protein adopts different conformations depending on which ligand it binds to[80]. In order to deal with the trouble of flexible receptors in docking, several approaches have been proposed: (1) letting the receptor or parts of it move during docking; (2) docking the compounds into numerous different conformations of the same receptor and aggregating the results; and (3) docking into averaged receptor representations. In a few cases, more than one of these methods are used based on the requirements in question.Required improvements: d.
