According to data from the International Civil Aviation Organization, 1647 million people traveled by air in 2000 and, despite problems related to security restrictions and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it is anticipated that the number of passengers will increase annually by 4.4% until 2015. 1 More than 2 million air traffic operations were handled during 2005 in airports managed by the Spanish aviation authority (Aeropuertos Espa\u00f1oles y Navegaci\u00f3n A\u00e9rea, AENA), representing travel by 179 million passengers. 2 Those figures correspond to a 29% increase in the number of passengers since 2000, with an annual increase of 6%. 2 In addition, advances in the monitoring and treatment of many chronic respiratory diseases have allowed changes in the lifestyle of patients. Thus, patients are now able to consider leisure and professional activities that were not possible some years ago.",

Analysis of all 2322 cases in which the first-aid kit was used on commercial aircraft belonging to the IATA between August 1984 and July 1988 showed that chest pain and dyspnea were 2 of the 3 most common causes, along with loss of consciousness. 5, 6 Likewise, 62% of passengers who required medical assistance had a known medical condition associated with the episode that occurred on board the aircraft, 6 further indicating the importance of careful assessment prior to flight. Along similar lines, a service offering the assistance of experts by radio during in-flight emergencies received 8450 calls in 2001, of which 11% corresponded to respiratory problems. 7, 8 Thus, respiratory problems may represent up to 11% of in-flight emergencies.",

The layer closest to the Earth is the troposphere, which extends from sea level to 9144 m (30 000 feet) at the poles and to 18 288 m (60 000 feet) at the equator (Appendix 1). Today's commercial aircraft fly within this zone. Atmospheric pressure depends on the column of air above the measurement point; consequently, the higher the altitude, the lower the pressure. Since the reduction in atmospheric pressure is logarithmic (Figure 1 ), at lower levels small changes in altitude produce substantial changes in pressure. Thus, at 6096 m (20 000 feet) the atmospheric pressure is less than half that at sea level.",

Nevertheless, rapid changes in altitude within this zone can cause minor problems due to the expansion of gases trapped within the body. The physiologically deficient zone extends from 3000 to 15 200 m. In that zone, the reduction in barometric pressure causes a critical environmental hypoxia, necessitating the use of supplementary oxygen at higher altitudes. From a physiologic point of view, space begins at an altitude of 15 000 m. In this zone, the low ambient pressure means that humans are unable to survive even with supplementary oxygen and they require pressurized suits.

            "text": "Commercial aircraft generally fly at an altitude of around 11 000 to 12 200 m (36 000-40 000 feet). 1, 24, 25 If the internal pressure of the aircraft were to be directly dependent upon the external atmospheric pressure the environment would be incompatible with life. Consequently, aircraft must be pressurized, that is, have elevated pressure compared with that of the external environment. To achieve this, they take ambient air and compress it. Since the gas heats up in this process, it must subsequently be cooled. 26 The pressure is controlled according to the quantity of air injected and through the use of escape valves set to the desired pressure. To support the pressure difference, the structure of the aircraft must be reinforced and that increases its weight. As a result of both the increased weight and the additional energy required to compress the air, cabin pressurization increases aircraft fuel consumption and thereby decreases their independence. The pressurization system used by commercial aircraft is known as isobaric. 27 Initially, as the aircraft climbs in altitude, it maintains the same ambient pressure as its environment, and then, from a certain altitude, it maintains a constant (isobaric) pressure, irrespective of changes in altitude. Many military aircraft employ a different system known as differential-isobaric pressurization, which imposes fewer structural requirements and thereby saves weight. 27 Due to the technical limitations mentioned and the cost, aircraft pressure is not maintained at that of sea level but rather at an intermediate pressure; that pressure depends on the type of aircraft but is usually approximately equivalent to that of an altitude of 2400 m. 1 altitude, the atmospheric oxygen tension is equivalent to breathing 15.1% oxygen at sea level. Although international legislation establishes that minimum cabin pressure should correspond to an altitude of 2438 m (8000 feet), 34 the pressure does not remain constant throughout a flight. In a large series of measurements performed during commercial flights, it was determined that the conditions within aircraft cabins usually correspond to an altitude of 1800 to 2400 m (6000-8000 feet) above sea level. 29, 30, 35 Survival in the event of a sudden reduction in cabin pressure necessitates the use of oxygen masks (obligatory equipment on commercial flights). It is also important to note that at an altitude of 10 600 m a person will lose consciousness in 30 to 45 seconds.",

            "text": "The degree of pressurization also depends on the type of plane. The old Concorde was pressurized at a comfortable level corresponding to an altitude of 1829 m (6000 feet). The current tendency for new models of aircraft, whether manufactured by Boeing or Airbus, is to pressurize at this more comfortable, safer pressure. 36 However, the new Airbus 380 is expected to carry around 600 passengers with a cabin pressure equivalent to an altitude of more then 2438 m (8000 feet) for up to 20 hours. 24 In addition to the difficulties caused by changes in barometric pressure, the external environment presents additional problems for commercial flights. The concentration of ozone, which is very low at sea level, increases with altitude and peaks in the stratosphere. Ozone, which is important to filter ultraviolet radiation, is toxic to the respiratory system, even at concentrations below 1 part per million (ppm), which can be reached at some common flight altitudes. To manage this problem, planes have catalytic ozone converters installed to reduce the concentration of the gas. The regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration establish a maximum mean concentration of 0.1 ppm and a maximum peak concentration of 0.25 ppm. 1 The temperature falls by approximately 2\u00baC for every 300 m increase in altitude, necessitating warming of the air inside the cabin. 27 This air normally has a low humidity (5%), which can cause problems for some individuals. Most commercial aircraft recirculate approximately 50% of the air to improve humidity and energy efficiency. The air must be filtered to retain particles smaller than 0.3 \u00b5m in diameter using highefficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters similar to those used in hospital operating theaters. In addition to particles in suspension, this system is considered effective for the retention of bacteria, fungi, and even viruses released during speech, coughing, or sneezing ( Figure 3 ). The air is renewed 15 to 20 times per hour, although this may vary according to the model and the zone of the plane. The cabin ventilation system generates transverse airflow and is able to renew the air more effectively than in buildings with air conditioning. Complex electronic systems with sensors located throughout the cabin control the temperature and regulate valves in order to maintain a temperature that is as homogeneous as possible. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the carbon dioxide content of this filtered and conditioned air is usually very low (1000 ppm).",

            "text": "The partial pressure of inspired oxygen (PiO 2 ) is a function of the atmospheric pressure and the vapor pressure of water. 37 As the vapor pressure of water at the same body temperature remains stable with altitude, PiO 2 will decrease with altitude (hypobaric hypoxia). 38 Breathing ambient air at 2438 m (8000 feet) is equivalent to breathing 15.1% oxygen at sea level, meaning PiO 2 falls from 150 mm Hg at sea level to 107 mm Hg at 2438 m. 38, 39 In healthy subjects, this can represent a reduction in PaO 2 from 98 to 55 mm Hg, 35, 39, 40 which is usually well tolerated and does not produce symptoms. However, in patients with chronic respiratory diseases and some degree of baseline hypoxemia, the reduction in PiO 2 during the flight can cause more marked reductions in oxyhemoglobin saturation. [41] [42] [43] Acute exposure to a hypobaric environment triggers hyperventilation, which is essentially induced by stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors and is usually mediated by an increase in tidal volume. 38 It also generates an increase in cardiac output to compensate for the residual systemic hypoxia. This increase is mainly mediated by tachycardia 31 and is usually proportional to the drop in oxygen saturation. 44 The increased pulmonary perfusion caused by the rise in cardiac output is associated with hypoxic vasoconstriction of the pulmonary artery and increased systolic pulmonary pressure. 45 As a consequence of the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, there is a redistribution of pulmonary blood flow and an increase in perfusion of certain areas of the lungs compared with the situation at sea level. 45 Altitude is also associated with limitation of oxygen diffusion from the atmosphere into the pulmonary capillaries as a consequence of the interaction of various factors. 46 Both the reduced PiO 2 and the reduction in affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen in conditions of low PaO 2 lead to a more marked drop in the oxygen content of the pulmonary capillaries than at sea level. Finally, the transit time of blood through the pulmonary capillaries is shortened due to the tachycardia caused by the altitude and this limits the time available to establish an adequate oxygen equilibrium. 47 The net result is an increase in the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. 42, 48, 49 In addition, the oxyhemoglobin saturation is significantly reduced during physical exercise in a hypobaric environment. 50 Exercise at high altitudes also increases the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference in subjects who normally reside at sea level, while it does not affect those native to high altitudes. 51 Studies performed using the multiple inert gas elimination technique have shown that hypobaric hypoxia is associated with a greater heterogeneity in the ventilation-perfusion ratio and a limitation of diffusion that together worsen hypoxemia as exercise intensity increases. 52 Limited diffusion secondary to reduced PiO 2 appears to exert the greatest influence on blood gas alterations during exercise in a hypobaric environment. 51 Additionally, the interstitial edema caused by extravasation of fluids into the extravascular space appears to potentiate the ventilation-perfusion imbalance.",

In patients with respiratory diseases, and even in young, apparently healthy individuals with small apical bullae, the phenomenon can generate more serious problems. [53] [54] [55] [56] Ears. Air trapping can occur in the ears due to partial or complete obstruction of the Eustachian tube, which normally equalizes air in the middle ear with the outside. This can occur both during ascent and descent and is also one of the main problems associated with underwater diving. It can be the result of a chronic intrinsic or acquired obstruction or an acute process caused by an infection or allergic reaction. With increasing altitude, the air expands and exerts a pressure on the tympanic membrane, which expands outward. When a pressure increase of 12 to 15 mm Hg is reached, a small bubble of air is expelled into the nostrils and is sometimes accompanied by a small noise. Upon descent, the reverse situation occurs. The external pressure increases and the tympanic membrane is pressed inwards. It is much more likely for obstruction to occur in this situation since the Eustachian tube functions less effectively in this direction. This air block can produce sounds, nausea, and pain in the ears that is sometimes very intense, particularly if the finally phase of the descent occurs very rapidly. A useful maneuver to prevent this obstruction involves repeated swallowing of saliva. Consumption of liquids or food can also help. If the condition persists, gentle Valsalva maneuvers are recommended. 38 Paranasal sinuses. The paranasal sinuses can present similar problems to those experienced in the ear. In this case, the obstruction may be due to chronic lesions such as polyps or to acute problems such as mucus generated in response to infections or allergies. In general, the problem appears during descent and in 70% of cases affects the frontal sinuses. The pain can become very intense. [53] [54] [55] [56] Barodontalgia. Some subjects may experience dental pain, mainly during ascent to between 1500 and 3000 m. It was initially thought that small pockets of air trapped during dental restoration or other manipulations were the cause of the problem. However, it has not been possible to confirm that hypothesis, despite the association of symptoms with different types of dental complaints.",

In HIV-positive patients, 3 negative sputum stains or a negative sputum culture are required during the course of the treatment.

For instance, a study was performed in which in-flight hypoxemia was assessed in a group of patients with COPD who had a resting PaO 2 of more than 70 mmHg, without hypercapnia, and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) less than 50% of reference. 63 In 53% of the patients, PaO 2 was less than 55 mm Hg at an altitude of 2438 m and 33% had a PaO 2 of less than 50 mm Hg. What was even more noteworthy in that study was that 86% of the patients had a PaO 2 less than 50 mm Hg when they undertook lowintensity exercise similar to that necessary to walk along the aisle of the cabin or to go to the bathroom. 63 Similar findings have been obtained in patients with interstitial disease. 35 Figure 4 shows a proposed algorithm for patient assessment. In those patients who receive home oxygen therapy, it is recommended that the oxygen flow be increased during the flight, usually by 1 to 2 L/min. In other patients, in-flight hypoxemia should be estimated if they have a PaO 2 less than 70 mm Hg or an SpO 2 less than 93%, if the forced vital capacity (FVC) or DLCO is less than 50% of reference, or if other risk factors are present ( Table 3) .",

The most important is the consequence of their very large 90% confidence interval, which is \u00b17.5 mm Hg, mainly due to the use of very small samples in their calculation. It is notable that in 18 patients with severe COPD differences have been detected between the actual PaO 2 during the flight and that estimated in the equation of Gong et al 67 of -6 \u00b16 mm Hg (range, -15 to 6 mm Hg). 36 In almost all cases, patient series used to develop the equations have involved healthy men or men with COPD, meaning that accurate information on women is lacking. Nor have flight duration and cabin conditions been considered. In addition, the equations have not been validated with another hypoxia test repeated after the test used to generate them. It is possible that equations that include FEV 1 underestimate the severity of hypoxemia triggered by altitude in hypercapnic patients, 69 since some authors have demonstrated that PaO 2 at altitude is inversely proportional to PaCO 2 at sea level. 63 In the same way, equations that use FEV 1 or FEV 1 /FVC in healthy subjects probably overestimate PaO 2 at altitude. 73 It is also likely that the cause of the hypoxemia should be taken into account. For instance, hypoxemia as a result of shunt is affected very little by altitude, while that caused by ventilation-perfusion imbalance is highly dependent upon PiO 2 . 74, 75 Recently, a specific prediction equation that includes DLCO was developed for patients with restrictive disease. 71 Another equation relevant to patients with COPD or interstitial disease has also been proposed. 72 In addition, in recent years models have incorporated PaCO 2 , both for healthy subjects and patients with COPD. 70 In the light of available data, the equation published by Muhm 70 would be the most recommendable in healthy subjects and patients with COPD, while that of Christensen et al 71 would be advisable for patients with restrictive disease.",

In addition, the FiO 2 can be reduced if the inspiratory flow of the patient exceeds the total flow generated by the apparatus. Although its role is more limited, the dead space inside the mask also affects the concentration of oxygen provided. 72 It is also necessary to consider that nitrogen is 14% less dense than oxygen, meaning that the carryover capacity for air through the Venturi system is lower than that of oxygen, thereby making the FiO 2 achieved less accurate. 77 Thus, it appears reasonable to suggest that if this system is used to administer the hypoxic gas mixture then FiO 2 should be monitored simultaneously.",

However, in order for reduced air density or flow turbulence to generate an increase in FEV 1 or a reduction in work of breathing, altitudes of more than 3000 m are required, 81 suggesting that these factors will have little influence. In addition, the potential beneficial effect of the reduced air density will never be greater than the negative effect caused by the reduction in PiO 2 , the increase in lung elasticity and air trapping, and the poor distribution of ventilation. 80, 82 The length of the flight is also not taken into account during hypoxic challenge. However, changes in arterial blood gases during a flight lasting 5 hours have recently been analyzed in patients with COPD. 36 It has been demonstrated that when patients remain seated PaO 2 falls until cruising altitude is reached and then remains stable for the rest of the flight. 36 There is less consensus regarding the application of these recommendations in children with respiratory diseases. Little information is available on physiologic changes at altitude in children. In addition, the spectrum of disease can be very broad. In premature babies with acute viral respiratory infection there is a greater risk of apnea due to immaturity of the breathing pattern. In that case, environmental hypoxia can increase the risk of apnea and it is therefore recommended that infants do not fly until 6 months after the date for full-term birth. On the other hand, some children with cystic fibrosis are better adapted to a hypoxic environment, probably through changes in the dissociation characteristics of hemoglobin. As a result, the current recommendation considers that children with an FEV 1 less than 50% of reference for cystic fibrosis or other chronic lung disease should undergo a hypoxic challenge test and that if SpO 2 is less than 90% during the test then provision of oxygen during the flight should be prescribed. 7, 83 The most recommendable route for administration of the hypoxic gas mixture in children is breathing in a plethysmography chamber.",

It has been confirmed that provision of oxygen through nasal prongs at 2 L/min in healthy subjects and patients with obstructive or restrictive disease who breathe an ambient FiO 2 of 15% achieves an SpO 2 similar to that recorded when they breathe at an FiO 2 of 21%. 76 In restrictive diseases, a flow rate of 2 L/min also appears to be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation during the flight, although when the patient moves about the aircraft it may be advisable to increase the flow to 4 L/min, so long as an extension is available. 71 Finally, provision of supplementary oxygen should be considered a safe and effective procedure for the management of many patients with chronic respiratory diseases who undertake a journey by air. 41, 65, 84 For example, it has recently been described that provision of oxygen during flights of up to 13 000 km allowed a group of patients with severe lung disease to reach their destinations satisfactorily. 86 In that study, only a few episodes of near fainting were observed due to insufficient oxygenation when going to the bathroom without supplementary oxygen. 86 consultation prior to air travel. 87 However, the response of physicians cannot currently be clear and robust, since there is insufficient scientific evidence and many elements remain to be clarified.",

However, this level is arbitrary and no studies have analyzed its possible consequences in periods of time closer to those of flights, although flight duration appears to have less effect than the altitude reached. 29 Despite the potential impact of COPD, few studies have addressed the problem of hypoxemia at high altitude during air travel in this setting. Furthermore, the studies performed have involved small samples of patients without severe hypoxemia, the majority eucapnic, and without significant cardiovascular comorbidity. 28, 32, 65, 90, 91 The results of those studies indicate that patients can have reductions in PaO 2 of up to 25 mm Hg when they reach an in-flight altitude of 2438 m (8000 feet). This situation is not uncommon in normal flights, 29 and although the incidence of medical problems appears minimal in the general population, 35,92 the same is not true of COPD patients, in whom symptoms and the requirement for in-flight medical assistance are more common. 88 Nevertheless, these events do not normally appear to be particularly serious, and when they are, they are usually cardiovascular in origin. 88, 92 Although the interpretation of these data may be erroneous due to the limitations of their collection, it is also possible that the tolerance of hypoxemia in patients with COPD (without other factors that could alter oxygen transport such as heart disease or anemia) is greater than might be expected.",

The probability of transmission is also reduced to almost zero in passengers seated 15 rows from the zone of infection. 100, 101 However, this \"safe distance\" does not apply in the case of a patient with SARS, who could infect any other healthy passenger seated in the next 7 rows. 102 Studies performed by the WHO have failed to demonstrate that air recirculation by itself facilitates transmission of infectious disease on board aircraft.

The epidemic outbreak of SARS, for which the causative agent is a coronavirus, is the most recent and representative example of a disease transmitted by a very small number of travelers to other countries and continents within a few weeks. 112 Studies showed that in 5 of the 40 flights investigated for carrying patients infected with the SARS virus transmission of the virus to other passengers was likely to have occurred. 102.113-116 The majority of the patients who were infected had been seated in the 5 rows closest to the index case, although at least in 1 flight lasting 3 hours (Hong Kong-Beijing) an outbreak occurred that affected a high percentage of passengers seated up to 7 rows from the index case and subsequently in more than 300 secondary cases. 102 Possible explanations for that outbreak have been sought, and although no conclusive results have been obtained, it has been suggested to have occurred mainly through aerial transmission from a direct or indirect contact, that some of the passengers were infected prior to the flight, or that it occurred as a result of defective cabin ventilation. The cabin crew may have an increased risk of acquiring the disease due to their movement through the aircraft. 102 The WHO developed a series of recommendations and guidelines, which included a series of measures that should be followed by all countries (Appendix 4) . 114, 115 Once those measures were put into practice, no new cases of long-distance propagation of the disease were identified. 101 Influenza. Epidemic infection with the influenza A virus appears between the months of October and April in the northern hemisphere and between May and September in the southern hemisphere. In a recent study undertaken in Switzerland, almost 13% of passengers who suffered fever during a journey to subtropical or tropical regions had a significant antibody titer against influenza viruses when they returned and in more than 6% it was possible to demonstrate a seroconversion of more than 4 times the initial titer. The most common pathogens in fever episodes outside the periods of local epidemic were influenza viruses. 117 That source may be the cause of some of the limited outbreaks that occur during the nonepidemic period. 118, 119 Other viruses such as influenza B and parainfluenza also have demonstrated pathogenic capacity. 120, 121 As in conventional epidemic outbreaks, a series of risk factors affect acquisition of infection, such as age over 65 years, presentation of comorbid conditions, and close contact with the index case, meaning that tourism in groups can facilitate infection. 120 Nevertheless, only 3 studies have reported infection during air travel. 103, 118, 121 The passengers seated in the rows closest to the index case were the most often affected, although given the high infectiousness of the virus, between 25% and 70% of the passengers was possible in flights lasting longer than 3 hours and up to 20% of secondary familial contacts developed the disease. Suspension or failure of the ventilation system favors disease transmission, as demonstrated in a flight in which an individual with flu infected 72% of the passengers. 103 Some countries recommend flu vaccination for those passengers undertaking journeys to the southern hemisphere during the summer and who were not vaccinated during the previous year. 122",

This virus has a shorter incubation period and is more contagious than the SARS virus. The USA has prepared a national plan to prevent the spread of outbreaks through the establishment of a series of specific health measures in airports. In addition to an increase in the number of health care workers, medical consulting rooms have been built that allow the health of passengers to be assessed and isolation rooms created to establish a quarantine area in international airports. Those facilities are in permanent contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and have access to passenger information for all flights in order to identify contacts of a possible index case. 129 To date, the benefits of such a strategy have not been demonstrated and it is quite unlikely that it would prevent or slow an epidemic caused by introduction of the influenza or SARS virus. 130 Detection of individuals with the disease exclusively in the destination airport would only have consequences for the detection of individuals who developed the clinical features during the flight and of contacts, thereby making the sensitivity low. Most experts are in favor of strategies similar to those followed in the SARS outbreak, including monitoring to detect individuals with symptoms in the departure airport, in an effort to prevent individuals with the disease from boarding the flight. [131] [132] [133] [134] If a case of infection with the avian influenza virus is confirmed, isolation measures similar to those followed for patients and contacts with SARS must be established, treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors should be initiated immediately, and in contacts, prophylactic measures with those drugs should be started during the first 48 hours. If a specific vaccine is available it should be immediately administered to contacts. 135 The WHO has established a global plan in which these elements are considered. 136, 137 Recently, a series of recommendations and considerations were prepared on the management of exposure to an infectious disease during commercial air travel 101 :",

There is some disagreement regarding estimation of the level of hypoxemia in those patients. Although in a study performed in a small group of patients aged between 11 and 16 years, hypoxic challenge predicted with a high level of sensitivity and specificity the development of desaturation during the flight, later studies have not confirmed those findings. 138 A study undertaken by the same group that contained a larger number of subjects and involved longer flights (8-13 hours) contradicted the earlier findings and showed that an FEV 1 less than 50% of reference better identified patients who desaturated than did the results of hypoxic challenge. 83 Only a small percentage of the patients who displayed reductions in SpO 2 to below 90% presented symptoms and required oxygen supplementation. 83 However, it should be noted that the patients included in those studies were stable, had disease that was not very advanced, and were younger than other groups of patients with cardiac or respiratory diseases for whom reduction of PaO 2 to below 50 mm Hg necessitates the implementation of oxygen therapy during the flight. This would explain the greater tolerance of hypoxia seen in patients with cystic fibrosis, confirmed both in acute exposure in hypobaric chambers 139 and during time at altitude. 140 In addition, in patients with cystic fibrosis, the results of hypoxic challenge are particularly variable over time and can change within a few weeks. 141, 142 Consequently, the decision to have a cystic fibrosis patient use oxygen therapy during a flight should not be based exclusively on hypoxic challenge tests but also on clinical parameters and the degree of bronchial obstruction. 140 Other recommendations to consider in patients with cystic fibrosis who intend to travel by air are summarized in Table 5 .",

It is based on a triad formed by stasis of venous blood flow, damage to the vascular endothelium, and hypercoagulability. These circumstances coincide in acquired-transient or persistent-or congenital conditions defined as risk factors, present in approximately 75% of patients with VTD. 145 Extended journeys have been associated with an increased incidence of VTD 146 and have been included in the list of risk factors. 147, 148 In 1977, the term \"economy class syndrome\" was coined following the description of 8 cases of VTD after flights in economy class. 149 The aim was to highlight that the limited space within which to stretch the legs during an extended period of time reduces venous return and favors stasis of venous blood flow. 150 This situation is not exclusive to air travel in economy class. It has also been described in business class 151 and in other forms of travel, such as cars and buses, 152 involving long periods of time with the lower limbs flexed and at rest.",

            "text": "Apart from venous stasis, there is a lack of agreement regarding other factors associated with air travel that could contribute to DVT such as dehydration, favored by the low humidity of the cabin and in some cases increased by the diuretic effect of coffee or alcoholic drinks, and the hypobaric hypoxia associated with pressurized cabins. Dehydration could predispose to DVT as a result of hemoconcentration and blood hyperviscosity, although this hypothesis has not been confirmed. It has been observed in experimental studies that hypobaric hypoxia favors activation of clotting 153, 154 and reduces physiologic fibrinolytic activity of endothelial cells 154 ; however, those results have not been reproduced in subsequent studies. 155 Incidence and risk of VTD. Studies addressing the incidence and risk of thrombosis associated with long-distance flights have employed a variety of different methods and yielded disparate results. For passengers with a high risk of thrombosis due to the presence of additional risk factors the incidence of VTD appears to be high, from 3% to 5%. 156, 157 In patients at low or moderate risk the incidence drops to between 0% and 1%. 157, 158 Most of the VTD events that were identified were asymptomatic DVT that exclusively affected the venous territory of the calf, although the screening method used in almost all of the studies involved venous compression ultrasound with or without Doppler, raising questions over the results due to the limited sensitivity of the technique for distal clots. The influence of other individual risk factors appears to be decisive in generating DVT. 159 The incidence of pulmonary embolism has been assessed in cohort studies. [160] [161] [162] According to data collected in Paris airports between 1984 and 1998, the incidence of this entity has increased. 160 Significant differences have been described in incidence rates according to distance traveled, ranging from 0.01 per 106 passengers for distances of less than 5000 km to 4.8 cases per 106 passengers in flights of more than 10 000 km. 161 Differences were also seen according to distance traveled in a study performed at Madrid Barajas Airport. 162 In flights lasting more than 8 hours the incidence of pulmonary embolism was 1.65 per 106 passengers and in flights lasting 6 to 8 hours it was 0.65 per 106 passengers, while no cases were observed in flights lasting less than 6 hours. Consequently, 6 hours has been considered the cutoff for recommending general measures for the periodic movement of the limbs. 163 The relative risk of VTD is difficult to establish due to the heterogeneity of the studies. 152, 157, 164 Considering only air travel, the risk is not clear (odds ratio, 1.3), 164 and consequently, it could not be considered as an independent risk factor. However, in passengers with additional risk factors for thrombosis, the odds ratio increased in all studies to represent a 3-fold to 4-fold higher risk of VTD. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the immobility during a flight lasting more than 8 hours increases the levels of certain markers of clotting in subjects without risk factors for thrombosis, but it remains to be established whether this represents an increased risk of VTD. 165 Prophylactic measures. Patients must be assessed individually and the presence of other risk factors for venous thrombosis identified (Table 6 ) in order to adopt prophylactic interventions. Classification of the risk as moderate or high in these circumstances is not well established. It seems reasonable to extrapolate the impact of each of these factors on VTD.",

Most patients can travel despite limitations, so long as the journey is sufficiently prepared and no elements are left to chance. 170 In general, an increase in oxygen flow of 1 to 2 L is recommended in patients who receive home oxygen therapy. 171 It is also essential to know the conditions of each airline company prior to embarking upon a journey, both in terms of the transport and provision of oxygen and in relation to the accessories required by the patient (wheelchair, ventilator) and the requirement to travel with an escort. Some companies allow the passenger to carry small oxygen bottles (a maximum of 2 bottles less than 0.5 m long and 250 mm in diameter), 172 but other companies do not accept transport of oxygen, although they allow the use of some oxygen concentrators, according to very strict regulations, so long as the user has sufficient batteries available to last the entire duration of the flight. 173",
