Amplification of partial S1 (553 nt) was performed by primers described by Kim et al. 2001 (5) , and the S1 segment (2785 nt) was designed by using the conserved regions of 18 available PEDV sequences (Technical Appendix Table 1 ). The amplicons were sequenced with the initial amplification primers by using ABI PRISM 3130 Automated Capillary DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The 18 sequenced samples were then tested by PCR for TGEV and PRCV by using the previously described RT-PCR kit and thermal cycling conditions (6) .",

Seven milliliters of a 20% fecal homogenate were ultracentrifuged on 5 ml of 30% sucrose cushion at 35,000 rpm for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 1x TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) and treated with DNase (RNasefree DNase set, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Purified viral RNA was extracted by using the protocol described above. Viral cDNA synthesis and whole genome amplification of nucleic acids were performed as described by Victoria and colleagues (7). The sequencing libraries were prepared by using the NEXTERA-XT DNA library Preparation kit (Illumina Inc. San Diego, CA, USA), and purified according to the manufacturer protocol and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq by using the Miseq Reagent Kit v2, 250-cycle paired-end run (Illumina Inc. San Diego, CA, USA). Reads were assembled by using PEDV or TGEV reference genomes. When mean coverage was <5 or polymorphisms were present in more than 20% of the reads, Sanger sequencing was performed by primers (Technical Appendix Table 2 ).",
