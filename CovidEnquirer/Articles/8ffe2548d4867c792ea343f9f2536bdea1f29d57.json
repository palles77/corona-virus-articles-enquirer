To prevent and mitigate these disasters it is critical to rapidly and accurately identify the characteristics of the contaminant sources. Although remarkable achievements have been made in identifying a single indoor contaminant source in recent years, the issues related to multiple contaminant sources are still challenging. This study presents a method for identifying the exact locations, emission rates, and release time of multiple indoor contaminant sources simultaneously released at constant rates, by considering sensor thresholds and measurement errors. The method uses a two-stage procedure for rapid source identification. Before the release of contaminants, only a limited number of time-consuming computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations need to be conducted. After the release of contaminants, the method can be executed in realtime. Through case studies in a three-dimensional office the method was numerically demonstrated and validated, and the results show that the method is effective and feasible. The effects of sensor threshold, measurement error and total sampling time on the source identification performance were analysed, and the limitations and applicability of the method were also discussed.",

The sudden release of these contaminants, accidentally or intentionally, can potentially result in exposure to toxic gases, fire, explosion, epidemic, or radiation. All these incidents would lead to significant casualties and property losses if no effective response measures were taken. In recent years, several tragic incidents, such as the Tokyo subway sarin attack, severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and the Fukushima nuclear leak, have aroused the concern of indoor environmental safety. To prevent and mitigate disasters due to the sudden release of hazardous contaminants, it is critical to promptly and accurately identify the characteristics of the contaminant sources, such as locations, emission rates, and release time. Source identification is an important premise for developing effective response measures, such as source elimination, dilution ventilation, air purification, evacuation, and shelter-in-place [5, 6] .",

The methods available for identifying indoor contaminant sources can be roughly categorised as backward and forward methods, as shown in Table 1 . To date, most backward and forward methods have shown their applicability in identifying a single indoor contaminant source [17e40] . In contrast, very few studies have discussed the scenarios involving multiple indoor contaminant sources, which are frequent and common in real-world applications [18, 38] . In residential or working environments, chemical contaminants are ubiquitous and continuously emitted from building materials, furniture, and equipment. In emergency situations related to earthquakes, blasts or impacts, hazardous chemicals may simultaneously escape from many leakage points. During an epidemic outbreak, many infected people may be found in hospital or other buildings. In terrorist attacks, chemical or biological agents may be deliberately released from many locations. Therefore, research on identifying multiple indoor contaminant sources is of great practical significance.",

When multiple contaminant sources are released, different combinations of sources may result in the same or close sensor measurements at a given time point. In other words, different causes may lead to the same outcome. Because the backward methods use the same outcome (sensor measurements at a given time point) as the initial condition, it is difficult to differentiate various possible causes. Besides, the backward methods would require a significant reduction in computing time for solving inverse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. This potentially limits their application in real-time source identification.",

In indoor environments, it is quite rare that different release scenarios will produce the same or close sensor measurements at all time points. Therefore forward methods are more promising for finding a unique solution. In addition, the two-stage procedure of the forward methods (see Table 1 ) also makes real-time source identification possible. A major constraint of the forward methods is that most of these methods only work well using a fast contaminant transport model, such as a multi-zone model, because a large number of simulations are usually required before a release incident to cover all possible scenarios. The multi-zone model generally assumes a uniform contaminant distribution in one zone [41, 42] . Therefore the forward methods using the multi-zone model cannot identify the exact locations of contaminant sources in each zone or room.",

By using an analytical expression of indoor contaminant dispersion, the theoretical model only requires a limited number of CFD simulations. Because CFD simulations can provide detailed information of contaminant dispersion, the exact locations of contaminant sources can be identified by the theoretical model. The major constraint of this model is that it cannot work by using real sensors, mainly because the model cannot work when there is no response of sensors due to sensor thresholds. In real-world situations, the use of real sensors will make the problem of source identification much more difficult, primarily due to three issues: (1) no response of sensors due to sensor thresholds; (2) inevitable measurement errors; and (3) unknown release time of contaminant. This research aims to fill the gap by developing a more sophisticated method that can promptly identify the locations, emission rates, and release time of multiple indoor contaminant sources simultaneously released at constant rates, by considering the sensor threshold and measurement errors.",

The linear programming model identifies the emission rate of each potential source by minimizing the objective function with constraint functions. The objective function is the sum of absolute errors between concentrations calculated by Eq. (4) and those detected by sensors. The constraint functions are derived from Eq. (5). The detailed derivation procedure of the linear programming model is given in Appendix section. After solving the linear programming model, the emission rate of each potential source can be determined, and then the number, locations, and emission rates of indoor sources can be identified, because it is assumed that the locations of all potential sources are known. A major constraint of this model is that it can only work with a known release time of contaminant sources. In practice, the release time is usually unknown and must be identified. The linear programming model excludes negative emission rates by using constraints x ! 0. Ideally, any potential source with an identified emission rate greater than zero can be thought as a source. However, the identification results will inevitably contain some errors in practice because of the errors of numerical simulations and sensor measurements. If the identified emission rate of a potential source is a tiny number, a quantitative criterion is required to help determine whether the potential source actually release any contaminant.",

When the total sampling time of the FRS was less than 50 s, the identification method failed to obtain accurate results. The failure of the model may be explained by two reasons. Firstly, except the measurements from the FRS, there are no measurements from the other sensors, or the measurements from the other sensors are not enough. Secondly, the measurements from the other sensors are probably important to the source identification. When the total sampling time of the FRS was equal to or greater than 50 s, all identification results, except that corresponding to 90 s, were very accurate and varied in a narrow range. As shown in Table 8 , with the increase in total sampling time of the FRS, more sensors provided concentration data for source identification. These results indicate that extending the total sampling time of the FRS or using measurements from more sensors can contribute to improving the identification performance. In practice, the source identification method can be executed repeatedly by increasing the total sampling time of the FRS. A minimum or appropriate total sampling time of the FRS can be determined when the identification results tend to be stable. The results corresponding to 90 s were much worse than expected. This may be because the measurement errors were randomly generated.",

For most indoor environments equipped with mechanical ventilation, the airflow field can reach a steady-state much faster than the contaminant dispersion, and thus the airflow field can be regarded as steady during the dispersion of contaminant. Normally, indoor airflow is turbulent and the contaminant concentration is low enough that the contaminant dispersion only has a trivial effect on the airflow field and air density [43] . This assumption is, therefore, reasonable for most indoor environments. For quiescent environments, the presented method may also be applicable. The reason is that a static environment can also be thought with fixed airflow mode, in which pure molecular diffusion transports contaminant. It is worth noting that, the presented method is not applicable to the situations where the dispersion of contaminant is significantly different from that of passive gas, such as the releases of particles, aerosols, and a massive leakage of dense or light gas.

The case studies indicate that the performance of the method was closely related to the sensor threshold, measurement error, and total sampling time. When the levels of the sensor threshold and measurement error were given, the total sampling time of the FRS should exceed a specific value to ensure the success of source identification. Besides, the accuracy of source identification can be improved by decreasing the levels of the sensor threshold and measurement error, extending the total sampling time of the sensors, and using measurements from more sensors at different positions. The case studies also show that the method is promising for integration into an online identification system, because of its capability for rapid identification.",
