However, fever returned 3 days after steroid cessation and she required re-intubation 1 week later ( Figure 1C ).

Although other possible explanations for the initial improvement (eg, treatment of co-existing bacterial pathogen, mycobactericidal effect of levofloxacin) cannot be ruled out. The observed associations are striking, and subsequent deterioration following corticosteroid withdrawal strongly supports its role. The partial improvements may mislead clinicians to attribute clinical responses to concomitant antibacterial therapy, thus delaying diagnosis ",

Corticosteroid has been used as \"adjunctive\" therapy in severe tuberculous infections (eg, meningitis, pericariditis, fulminant pneumonia) to reduce complications. 1 Prompt clinico- radiological responses also are observed for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and varicella pneumonia, where immunopathogenesis is important. Skewed Th2 cytokine responses (eg, elevated interleukin-4, interleukin-10, and interleukin-13) are demonstrated in extensive/cavitatory pulmonary and miliary tuberculosis. 1 Hyper-production of tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 and interleukin-1\u2424, stimulated by lipoarabinomannan, also triggers acute lung injury. Corticosteroids can inhibit expression of these cytokines, suppressing symptoms. 6 It is important for clinicians to be aware that corticosteroid may mask the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Delay in antituberculous treatment may lead to higher mortality. 1 ",
