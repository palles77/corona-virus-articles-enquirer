In the guidance document 'Global surveillance during an influenza pandemic' released by the World Health Organization, three parameters were highlighted that should be documented quickly in this respect: the incubation period (time between infection and symptoms), the serial interval (time between symptoms onset in primary case and secondary case), and the reproduction ratio \u2044 number (average number of secondary cases per primary case). 3 These parameters are instrumental to assessing the feasibility and efficacy of intervention strategies against pandemic influenza. 4 Information regarding the serial interval and the reproduction number from past pandemics has been limited. For the serial interval, the best information concerned sea-sonal influenza infections 5, 6 and no information was available regarding past pandemics. There was comparatively more information regarding reproduction numbers, with estimates obtained in the last four pandemics (1889, 1918, 1957, 1968) . [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Estimates have ranged between 1 and 6 depending not only on place, time, wave, but also on the methods and assumptions used in estimation.",

The serial interval (SI), i.e., the time interval between the date of symptoms onset in one case and that in its infector, is therefore often considered instead of the GT because it has the same mean. 14 The GT or SI informs on the speed of transmission of the disease. It is not an intrinsic property of the disease, but a combination of biology (how much and when is a person infectious) and behavior (how many and when contacts leading to infection occur). 15 A random sample of pairs of secondary case and their infector would allow unbiased estimation of the SI but is seldom available. In practice, various designs are used to observe pairs of infectee \u2044 infector, and this may impact the observed distribution. 16 For example, cases may be observed in households, where common exposure may have led to coprimary cases and ongoing transmission to an overlap of secondary and tertiary cases.

Several methods are available to estimate reproduction numbers: using attack rates, 18 the exponential growth rate, 19 averaging over transmission chains. 20 An assumption regarding the GT distribution may be required to estimate the reproduction number; in this case, a shorter mean GT will likely lead to a smaller reproduction number estimate.

In the study where the index case could be different from the first, all cases after the index were considered as secondary cases of the index case. 27 The other five studies included contacts not limited to the household, 22, [30] [31] [32] [33] with mean SIs in the range of 2AE5-3AE5 days. Here, pairs of infector \u2044 infectee were identified where the infector was the only, or most probable, source of infection.",

In these calculations, coprimary cases (same day as index case) and those occurring more than 7 days after the index case were excluded. In all but two cases, the mean SI was calculated as the empirical mean of observed intervals, excluding the possibility of tertiary transmission. More sophisticated modeling allowing for several generations of transmission was carried out in the two other cases. In the first case, a householdbased study, the empirical mean SI (excluding coprimary cases and cases >7 days after) was 2AE9 days (95% CI [2AE7, 3AE1]). 24 After modeling, the reported mean SI decreased to 2AE6 days (95% CI [2AE2, 3AE5]). In the second case, derived from the FF100 cohort in the UK, the empirical mean SI of observed serial intervals was 3AE4 days (95% CI [2AE9, 3AE9]) and the reported mean SI decreased to 2AE5 days (95% CI [2AE1, 2AE9]) after modeling. 31 An overall estimate of the mean SI derived from these studies (excluding 28 ), weighting by the number of observed SIs used for estimation in each study, was 3AE0 days (CI 95% [2AE4, 3AE6]). No correlation was found between the reported SI and the size of the study (P = 0AE3) or the date of report (P = 0AE3).

All studies focused on the first few months of the pandemic, with data obtained between March and October 2009. Overall, the estimates at the community level (town, region or country) varied between 1AE1 and 3AE1, with a median value of 1AE6. In the Netherlands, as in other European countries (except the UK), the reproduction number was smaller than 1 (R = 0AE5) in the period considered. 32, 37 The largest estimate (R = 3AE3) was obtained from the analysis of a school outbreak. 22 Ten papers qualified the reproduction number as 'basic', with a range from 1AE3 to 2AE3, all assuming that the whole population was susceptible at first; this range was not significantly different from that of the otherwise reported R values. In 15 analyses, the exponential growth rate estimated from the initial epidemic curve was used to estimate the reproduction number, with a range of values between 0AE5 and 3AE1. The method for estimating the exponential growth rate was variable (for example, Poisson regression, 38 birth and death process, 39 least squares, 40 modified logistic growth 41 ), as was the GT distribution (mean GT between 1AE9 and 4AE1) and the formula linking the exponential growth rate to the reproduction number. Other methods of estimation included fitting the output of transmission models to the data. 34, 35, 42 In two instances, the reproduction number was estimated using cases seen in tourists returning from Mexico, yielding 1AE4 (95% CI [1AE2, 1AE8]) 34 when comparing the number of cases in 9 countries to model predictions and 1AE7 (CI 95% [1AE6, 1AE9]) using only the date of first introduction in 12 countries. 43 No correlation was found in the reported reproduction number and the GT used in its computation (r = )0AE04; P = 0AE83). There was a decreasing trend in the reported values with time (r = )0AE5, P = 0AE004), large estimates being more frequent at first. A first explanation was the inclusion of correction for under-reporting: while no correction was applied for an early estimate in Mexico (R = 2AE2 38 ) and another analysis (R = 2AE3 29 ), accounting for an increasing trend in case reporting led to large differences, from 2AE4 to 1AE6 after such correction in Australia, 44 from 2AE2 to 1AE7 in the United States, 36 and from 2 to 1AE4 in Mexico. 42 Another issue was the importance of school outbreaks in the early epidemic curve, so that the estimated reproduction number was not representative of transmission in the community. For example, the R estimate was 2AE3 in Japan with a GT of 1AE9 days, 39 but the reproduction number was approximately 1AE3 when transmission was later established in the community. 45 Considering only estimates for which underdeclaration was taken into account and the generation time was close to 3 days, the reproduction number was between 1AE2 and 2AE3, with median value 1AE5.",

Overall, the weighted mean SI of all estimates was 3AE0 days (CI 95% [2AE7, 3AE3]), but this reduced to 2AE6 days in the studies where tertiary transmission was accounted for. Studies in households may have provided the best framework to estimate the SI, as potential contacts could be more easily identified. The only truly prospective study yielded little information (8 events), 21 so that the best evidence remains that from American households. 24 The number of studies documenting the serial interval in the 2009 influenza pandemic contrasts with the relative absence of information for past pandemics or seasonal influenza. Indeed, before 2009, the two best documented values for the mean SI concerned seasonal influenza, with two estimates obtained in household-based studies: 2AE6 days (CI 95% 2AE1, 3AE0) 6 and 3AE6 days (CI 95% [2AE9, 4AE3]) 5 ; no information was available for past pandemics. The current estimate for A \u2044 H1N1 (2009) was somewhat closer to the first estimate; it was also in good agreement with the 2AE8 days obtained by using the profile of viral excretion as a indicative of the GT distribution. 46 As reported mean SIs are rather short, it is worth examining whether the mean SI could have been biased downwards. Changes in behavior and interventions may make long serial intervals unlikely. There was little information regarding behavior change and interventions in the reported studies: household members were, for example, instructed in simple hand-hygiene, 21 some index cases received antiviral treatment, 26 but neither isolation nor quarantine was reported. As all studies concerned the early phase of the pandemic, differences in attitude toward the A \u2044 H1N1 flu may have been limited. A second issue is that the combination of rapid transmission and limited number of contacts in households may lead to small intervals. 16 The secondary attack rates were modest (13%, 24 11AE2%, 31 11AE3%, 23 8% 21 ), arguing against a large effect in this respect because of susceptible depletion. A short follow-up could also limit the possibility of observing long serial intervals. In most studies when this was reported, the duration of follow-up in households was approximately 1 week so that few secondary cases should have been missed. Finally, some cases counted as secondary may have been attributed to common exposure (coprimary cases), leading to a downward bias. However, in most cases, cases occurring on the same date as the index case were excluded from the calculations, therefore limiting this bias.",

            "text": "Reproduction numbers for the A \u2044 H1N1 2009 pandemic varied according to place, methods, and hypotheses, with a reported range from 1AE1 to 3AE3. While the most used approach relied on determining the initial exponential growth, the formulas and fitting methods changed with authors and how the initial exponential growth period was chosen was little documented. When provided, the sensitivity analyses illustrated that somewhat arbitrary hypotheses (choice of the GT, correction for under-reporting, exponential growth period,\u2026) had a large effect on the reported value. In Mexico alone, estimates ranged between 1AE2 and 3AE1 during the same period. 29, 34, 38, 40, 42 Factors explaining these differences were numerous. The first is differences in data, either by nature (travelers back from Mexico or suspected \u2044 confirmed cases in Mexico or local epidemics or genetic sequence) or by collection time. For example, cases were added to the epidemic curve in retrospect, so that early estimates were biased upwards. 38 A second factor was the choice of the GT distribution, shorter mean GTs leading to smaller reproduction number estimates: from 3AE1 (mean GT = 4 days) to 2AE2 (mean GT = 3 days), 38 from 3AE4 (mean GT = 5AE5 days) to 1AE9 (mean GT = 2AE3 days; supplementary material 29 ), and from 2AE0 (mean GT = 2AE6days) to 1AE4 (mean GT = 1AE9 days 34 ). When similar mean GTs were allowed (approximately 3 days), less variability was present (2AE2, 38 2AE0, 34 2AE3 29 ). A third factor was underdeclaration in the initial period of the pandemic, leading to smaller estimates: from 2 to 1AE4 42 and from 2AE6 to 2AE4. 29 Methods less dependent on the completeness of the data (genetic sequences, travelers out of Mexico) consistently led to lower estimates, from 1AE2 to 1AE7. The short mean GT (1AE9 days 34 ) estimated early in Mexico may have led to underestimation when it was used to estimate the reproduction number in later studies. The impact was moderate: for example, the reproduction number in several countries from the southern hemisphere ranged between 1AE2 to 1AE6 using a GT of 1AE9 days 41 and increased by approximately 10% when a mean GT of 2AE8 days was used. In practice, collecting data that allow the joint estimation of the serial interval and reproduction ratio should be encouraged to limit these uncertainties. 48 In approximately one report of two, the authors described the estimated reproduction ratio as 'basic' (i.e., R 0 ), while others used 'initial', 'effective', several qualifiers or none. Estimating R 0 requires an additional assumption on the initial susceptibility of the population, and all authors reporting R 0 assumed, often implicitly, that the whole population was initially susceptible. It is now known that adults over 50 years of age were less susceptible to the disease, 24,49 making this assumption incorrect. Practically, this means that it is unlikely that any of the reported estimates were truly 'basic' and that accounting for differential susceptibility will be required to obtain R 0 estimates. For public health purposes, however, it is the initial R which is the most relevant estimates as it informs on the required strength of interventions and is useful to calibrate mathematical models. In this respect, the reproduction number may have been poorly estimated at the start of the pandemic, as a result of poor case ascertainment; how imported cases in the course of the outbreak were accounted for in estimation; and the over-representation of places like schools where transmission was large. 45 Several new methods have been proposed to estimate the reproduction number during the pandemic, 34, 36, 42, 50, 51 which should now be compared in terms of data requirements, applicability, and how they deal with the issues listed earlier to help select best practice.",
