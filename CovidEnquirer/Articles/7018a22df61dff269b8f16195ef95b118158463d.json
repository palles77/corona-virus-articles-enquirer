Most of the virus was neutralized in the first 2-3 min of a reversible reaction, which was followed by a second phase with a decreased neutralization rate and, in some cases, by a persistent fraction, which was a function of the MAb and of the antibody-to-virus ratio . Neutralization of TGEV is a specific event that requires the location of the epitope involved in the neutralization in the appropriate structural context, which is present in the wild-type virus but not in certain MAb escaping mutants . In neutralization of TGEV by binary combinations of MAbs specific for the same or for different antigenic sites, either no cooperation or a synergistic effect, respectively, was observed . Mechanisms of TGEV neutralization by MAbs were characterized at high, intermediate, and low antibody-to-virus ratios . Under these conditions, mainly three steps of the replication cycle were inhibited : binding of virus to the cell, internalization, and a step that takes place after internalization . In addition, virus aggregation could be responsible for the neutralization of 10 to 20% of virus infectivity . 2",

            "text": "Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is an enteric disease of swine associated with a high mortality in neonates, caused by a coronavirus that consists of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule of 26-30 kb and three structural proteins S, N, and M, with 1447, 382, and 262 amino acids, respectively (Siddell et al., 1983 ; Sturman and Holmes, 1983 ; Salt and Bahl, 1986 ; Kapke and Brian, 1986 ; Laude et al., 1987 ; Rasschaert and Laude, 1987) . In coronaviruses the S protein is responsible for the induction of neutralizing antibodies (Garwes et al., 1976 (Garwes et al., , 1978 Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . Studies on the antigenic structure of prototype coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus, infectious bronchitis virus, and TGEV) have shown that at least two critical sites are involved in their neutralization (Talbot et al., 1984 ; Wage et al., 1984 ; Mockett et al ., 1984 ; Fleming at al., 1986 ; Delmasatal., 1986) . In TGEV only the S glycoprotein has been involved in virus neutralization in the absence of complement . In this protein, a minimum of seven antigenic sites have been defined ; site A is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies, although other sites (B and D) , less immunogenic, are also involved in TGEV neutralization (Enjuanes et al., 1990 ; Delmas et al., 1986 ; Correa et al., 1990 ; . In addition, antibody-mediated complement-dependent virus neutralization has been reported with M-specific ' To whom requests for reprints should be addressed . 559 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (Woods et al., 1987 ; Laude et al., 1986) .",

The simplest explanation is that neutralization under those conditions was not due to blocking of the binding . The possibility that only the binding of the infectious virus was inhibited, which would represent a minor proportion, cannot be excluded . Nevertheless, it seems unlikely since the noninfectious virus was rendered noninfectious by different defects . A large proportion (up to 40%) of the virions were specifically bound to the cells . Obviously, the infectious virions were included among them . These results strongly suggest that both infectious and noninfectious virions have a functional spike protein mediating the binding of the virus to the cells . The limitations derived from the inhability to follow isolated infectious virions have been accepted in all the studies analyzing the interaction between viruses and cells, by electron microscopy or using radiolabeled virions (Fuller and Spear, 1985 ; FulleretaL, 1989 ; Highlander et al., 1987 ; Miller and Hutt-Fletcher, 1988) .

(A) Binding and internalization of 35 S-labeled purified TGEV were studied on ST cell monolayers grown on 24-well plates, by adding the virus (see Materials and Methods), incubating at 37\u00b0, immediately cooling the plates on ice at the indicated times, and removing the unbound virus by washing with binding medium to determine the cell-associated virus (U) or with pH 3 buffer to determine the internalized virus (\u2022) . (B) Internalization of 35 S-labeled purified TGEV on ST cell monolayers grown on 24-well plates was determined at the indicated temperatures, in the presence of undiluted hybridoma supernatants containing the TGEV S protein site C-specific MAb 6A .A6 (shaded columns), the site A-specific MAb 1 C .C 12 (hatched columns), or 40-fold excess of unlabeled TGEV (blank columns) . The extent of internalization was not affected by the presence of a control coronavirus (MHV) or by the absence of a MAb in the medium (results not shown) . Maximum radioactivity bound or internalized at 37\u00b0 in the absence of antibody and competing virus was set as 100% binding or internalization, respectively, and usually was 50% or 37%, respectively, of the total radioactivity added .",
