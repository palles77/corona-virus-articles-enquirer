            "text": "In human and veterinary medicine, reducing the risk of occupationally-acquired infections relies on effective infection prevention and control practices (IPCs). In veterinary medicine, zoonoses present a risk to practitioners, yet little is known about how these risks are understood and how this translates into health protective behaviour. This study aimed to explore risk perceptions within the British veterinary profession and identify motivators and barriers to compliance with IPCs. A cross-sectional study was conducted using veterinary practices registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. Here we demonstrate that compliance with IPCs is influenced by more than just knowledge and experience, and understanding of risk is complex and multifactorial. Out of 252 respondents, the majority were not concerned about the risk of zoonoses (57.5%); however, a considerable proportion (34.9%) was. Overall, 44.0% of respondents reported contracting a confirmed or suspected zoonoses, most frequently dermatophytosis (58.6%). In veterinary professionals who had previous experience of managing zoonotic cases, time or financial constraints and a concern for adverse animal reactions were not perceived as barriers to use of personal protective equipment (PPE). For those working in large animal practice, the most significant motivator for using PPE was concerns over liability. When assessing responses to a range of different \"infection control attitudes\", veterinary nurses tended to have a more positive perspective, compared with veterinary surgeons. Our results demonstrate that IPCs are not always adhered to, and factors influencing motivators and barriers to compliance are not simply based on knowledge and experience. Educating veterinary professionals may help improve compliance to a certain extent, however increased knowledge does not necessarily equate to an increase in risk-mitigating behaviour. This highlights that the construction of risk is complex and circumstance-specific and to get a real grasp on compliance with IPCs, this construction needs to be explored in more depth.",

            "text": "Veterinary professionals can encounter a variety of occupational health risks. A high prevalence of injury has been reported, predominantly in relation to large animal work (BEVA, 2014; Fritschi et al., 2006; Lucas et al., 2009) , dog and cat bites and/or scratches and scalpel or needle stick injuries (Nienhaus et al., 2005; Phillips et al., 2000; Soest and van Fritschi, 2004) . In addition to the risk of injury, the profession is also at risk of other occupational hazards including exposure to chemicals, car accidents (Phillips et al., 2000) and infec-tious diseases from zoonotic pathogens (Constable and Harrington, 1982; Dowd et al., 2013; Epp and Waldner, 2012; Gummow, 2003; Jackson and Villarroel, 2012; Lipton et al., 2008; Weese et al., 2002) . Work days lost because of zoonotic infections are less frequent than days lost to injury (Phillips et al., 2000) ; however, because of the potential seriousness of some zoonotic infections and increasing reports of occupationally-acquired antimicrobial resistant bacteria in veterinary professionals (Cuny and Witte, 2016; Groves et al., 2016; Hanselman et al., 2006; Jordan et al., 2011; Weese et al., 2006) , zoonotic risk in the veterinary profession deserves attention.",

This dissonance may be reflecting other occupational risks encountered by veterinary professionals, of which zoonotic diseases only represent a small proportion. Data from studies conducted overseas suggests veterinary medicine is a high risk profession. In one survey of Australian veterinary professionals, 71% reported at least one physical injury over a 10 year period (Phillips et al., 2000) . In addition to practice-acquired injuries, such as dog and cat bites, scalpel blade cuts and lifting of heavy dogs, the risk of car accidents was also noted (Phillips et al., 2000) . Further research in the German veterinary profession highlighted workplace accidents as the most prevalent occupational hazard (87.7%), followed by commuting accidents (8.2%). Occupationally-acquired zoonoses only represented 4.1% of the total hazards in the study (Nienhaus et al., 2005) . Practitioners are clearly working in a risky environment, particularly large animal vets, where farm environments are known to be inherently dangerous. A total of 7 fatal injuries and 292 major injuries were reported in British farmers or farmworkers in -2014 (HSE, 2014 , and a recent survey by the British Equine Veterinary Association revealed that on average, equine vets sustain seven to eight work-related injuries during a 30 year period (BEVA, 2014), highlighting just how hazardous these environments can be. Few data are available on occupational injuries in the British veterinary profession; however, when working in what could be interpreted as a high-risk environment, a constant exposure to risk for those living or working in these types of environment may lead to habituation to, or normalisation of risk (Clouser et al., 2015) . Individuals in this study who tended to grade common clinical scenarios as posing a moderate to high risk of zoonosis exposure were also more likely to \"just hope for the best\", perhaps suggesting they have normalised these situations and do not perceive them as requiring additional precautions.",

The invisibility of the disease also plays a role here; the pathogens are not visible therefore the perception of the risk they pose is more abstract. In addition, there is often a time lapse between exposure to the pathogen and onset of clinical signs, making an association between suboptimal IPC behaviour and outcome difficult (Cioffi and Cioffi, 2015) . In the UK, personal risk receives little attention in the veterinary profession's media, especially when compared with issues such as mental health, with reports of high levels of psychological distress and suicide in the profession (Bartram et al., 2010) and inclusion of issues around stress and mental wellbeing in surveys (Vet Futures, 2015) and veterinary curricula. This makes zoonotic disease risk less visible and may subject it to an availability heuristic, where the likelihood of an event is judged based on how easily an instance comes to mind (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) . The absence of diseases such as rabies from the UK may also mean that veterinary professionals underestimate the risk of zoonoses because they consider the impacts to be relatively minor, short-term and treatable. This affect heuristic may be especially pronounced when decisions are made under time pressure (Finucane et al., 2000) , perhaps reflected in this study's finding that those who viewed time constraints as a barrier to their use of PPE had less positive attitudes towards it.",

A risk might be acknowledged, yet if an individual does not feel vulnerable to this risk, there is no motivation or intention to change their behaviour. This perceived vulnerability is one of the factors considered in the protection motivation theory, where concern about a potential threat influences perception of the risk i.e. the more concerned an individual is about a disease, the higher risk they perceive it poses. If an individual feels vulnerable, this acts as a motivator for behaviour change (Schemann et al., 2013 ). This behavioural model has been applied to horse owners following the equine influenza outbreak in Australia where different levels of perceived vulnerability were identified in a cross section of the equine sector (Schemann et al., 2013 (Schemann et al., , 2011 .",

It is possible that veterinary professionals, because they feel knowledgeable about zoonotic diseases, feel less vulnerable to the risks they pose. This lack of perceived vulnerability may account for the substantial proportion of respondents who stated they would not use PPE when handling clinically sick animals; perhaps because they are confident in their ability to identify those cases with potentially zoonotic or infectious aetiologies. Identification of risk to self as a motivating factor was associated with a more \"positive attitude\" towards PPE use, but being a nurse was independently correlated with both of these variables. Possibly because nurses often have less influence in decisions over diagnostics or handling of cases, they may feel more vulnerable.",

These models are useful for explaining behaviour change in relation to infection control or biosecurity however they have had limited success in practice (Pittet, 2004) . The main criticism of these models is that they make an assumption that behaviour is rational, controllable and therefore modifiable (Cioffi and Cioffi, 2015) . In reality, behaviour is affected by many external influences such as culture and society. Society and culture are fluid, constantly changing concepts and consequently it makes incorporating them into behavioural models problematic. So while these models of behaviour are useful in explaining behaviour change to a certain extent, to gain a full understanding of what drives or inhibits behaviour change, social psychology and qualitative research is essential for making real impacts on practice.",

The \"positive attitude\" construct, related to self-efficacy, knowledge and confidence in equipment and practices, also clustered with a feeling that there is an expectation to demonstrate good practice. This could be a reflection of the influence of the practice culture on behaviour. In human healthcare, organisational factors, have been identified as one of the main drivers behind poor compliance with IPC practices (Cumbler et al., 2013; De Bono et al., 2014) . As compliance with infection control intersects individual behaviour and the cultural norms of the practice, the culture of veterinary practice will also be influencing behaviour surrounding infection control. It appears from the present study that when veterinary practices promote a culture of positive health behaviour and have high expectations of employees, this acts as a motivator for compliance with IPC practices. This highlights that behaviour change should also be implemented at an organisational level, rather than just focussing on individual behaviour.",

This attitude could be reflecting the importance of the vet-client relationship in veterinary practice. This is particularly relevant in farm animal practice, where vet-farmer relationships are often cultivated over extended time periods and each individual agricultural client represents a significant proportion of practices' income. Respondents working in large animal practice were more likely to be motivated to use PPE by liability concerns, again potentially a reflection of the pressure felt by veterinary professionals from their clients. This is an interesting dichotomy, as the use of PPE not only protects the practitioner, but also the animal from zoonotic disease transmission. Educating farm clients as to what infection control practices they should expect during clinical work on the farm may help mitigate concerns about negative client perceptions.",

These might be expected to cluster within practice; the response from a veterinary surgeon and nurse from the same practice might not be completely independent. However, it was not feasible to introduce practice as a random effect, as not enough practices returned two responses (22.2% returned responses from a veterinary nurse and veterinary surgeon from the same practice). As with any questionnaire-based research, this study will be subject to an element of responder bias, and the relatively low response rate of this study may accentuate this bias. This is particularly evident with male nurses, who are few in number, making them difficult to target using random selection methods. According to the latest RCVS annual report, male nurses represented just 2.1% of the total veterinary nurse population in the UK (RCVS, 2014), in the present study, 6% (95% CI 1.7-10.4) of respondents were male nurses. The RCVS database used to sample the veterinary population for this study does not contain information on specialism or type of practice, therefore it is not possible to assess whether this sample is representative of the wider veterinary profession. However, the demographic data on respondents are similar to data from the RCVS annual report; the mean age in our study was 42 years, compared with 41 years in the annual report. In addition, the gender split was similar; in our study, 61.1% (95% CI 55.1-67.1) of respondents were female and the RCVS reported 57.1% were female (RCVS, 2014) . Despite similarities between the respondents and the veterinary population in the UK, the low response rate means the results from this sample may not necessarily be generalisable to the wider veterinary population, however this study is the first to provide these baseline data on attitudes and beliefs regarding zoonoses in the British veterinary population, which can be built on with future studies.",
