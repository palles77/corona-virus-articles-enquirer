Aspects of the response make the assumption that the genetics of 45 SARS-CoV-2, including mechanisms of gene expression and molecular evolutionary rates, 46 are comparable with previously characterised coronaviruses [11] [12] . It remains highly 47 relevant to validate these assumptions experimentally with SARS-CoV-2-specific data, with 48 the potential to reveal further insights into the biology of this emergent pathogen.
