For example, a triple reassortant H3N2 influenza virus isolated from pigs was shown to replicate and be transmissible among turkeys. 4 Such evidence amplifies the concerns about interspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 between different domestic animal species and underscores the concern that these same viruses might also be able to infect humans who come in contact with the animals.",

As cats, another popular domestic animal, have already been demonstrated to host CIV H3N2, intraspecies transmission among cat populations is also possible but not yet demonstrated. Ferrets are also known to be susceptible to influenza A infection and display many clinical signs of human influenza infection with a similar complexity of signs. 8 Therefore, ferrets can be considered to predict the possibility for interspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 to humans.",

However, similarly exposed, na\u00efve ferrets did not demonstrate clinical signs or viral shedding and did not seroconvert. These data suggest that CIV H3N2 is transmissible from infected dogs to na\u00efve cats but not to na\u00efve ferrets, via respiratory droplets. These results further indicate that cats are similarly susceptible to signatic CIV H3N2 infection as are dogs. In addition, infected cats shed the virus in sufficient quantities to result in transmission of the virus to other cats. For an avian-human H9N2 influenza A virus to be transmitted by respiratory droplets to ferrets, it has been demonstrated that it is essential to have minimal molecular constraints (adaptation by minimal changes at the protein level) to infection in the host animal. 11 The necessity of adaptation to new host for airborne transmission was also demonstrated in a study showing that human influenza H3N2 virus, demonstrating preferential binding to a2,3linked sialic acid receptors, were not transmissible to ferrets (expressing a2,6-linked sialic acid receptors), although the virus could be shed from directly inoculated ferrets. 12 Also, CIV H3N2 causes histopathological lesions especially in lower respiratory tract where a2,3-linked sialic acid receptors were found to be abundant. 1, 13 These observations, combined with those of the present study, help explain why CIV H3N2, a virus of avian origin with possible recognition of a2,3-linked sialic acid receptors, could not be easily transmitted between CIV-infected dogs and na\u00efve ferrets.",

This observation implies that interspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 to ferrets is not fully established and that further adaptation might be needed. Such additional adaptation may occur when ferrets are intranasally inoculated with the virus. A previous report has indicated that viral deposition was primarily restricted to the upper trachea in ferrets exposed to airborne virus, whereas the deposition occurred in the peripheral lung tissue of animals infected by intranasal inoculation. 15 Therefore, the ferrets with intranasal infection had higher chance to allow CIV H3N2 to be adapted and the adapted viruses could be transmitted from the infected ferrets to the na\u00efve ferrets. Also, the direct contact by caging the ferrets together provided a much higher and prolonged exposure, even if the shed titers were lower, so that the ferrets to ferrets transmission of CIV H3N2 could be possible compared to dogs to ferrets transmission, which was restricted by aerosol transmission. Nevertheless, interspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 from dogs to ferrets was not as efficient as it was between dogs and cats, which implies further biological and epidemiological adaptation would be needed in the case of dogs to ferrets transmission.",
