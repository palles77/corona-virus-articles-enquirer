A frequent feature of infection with PRRSV is secondary bacterial infection, for example with Haemophilus parasuis, Streptococcus suis, Salmonella spp. or Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (Dee and Joo, 1994; Mengeling et al., 1994) . PRRSV has been characterized and classified in the recently proposed Arterivirus group, with morphological, physicochemical and genetic properties similar to those of the non-arthropod-borne togaviruses, such as lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus, equine arteritis virus, and simian haemorrhagic fever virus (Conzelmann et al., 1993; Meulenberg et al., 1993) . The genome of PRRSV is a single-stranded polyadenylated RNA molecule of positive polarity and of approximately 15 kb in length, which contains eight open reading frames (ORFs). The nucleocapsid protein is encoded by ORF7 and is highly conserved among both North American and European isolates (Mardassi et al., 1994; Meulenberg et al., 1995) .",

A strong hybridization signal was detected in the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells randomly scattered in the thickened alveolar septa (Fig. 1) . A less intense signal was detected on rare occasions in cells that resembled type 2 pneumocytes (Fig. 2) . The positive cells generally had large oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm. Comparison with haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from the same block indicated that most of the positive cells were interstitial macrophages. The alveolar macrophages frequently showed a strong hybridization signal, representing PRRSV replication (Fig. 3) . The distribution of positive cells in the lung was very patchy. PRRSV nucleic acids were detected within the cytoplasm of alveolar macrophages. When hybridization signal was detected in alveolar macrophages, it was usually associated with inflammation. Hybridization signal was occasionally detected in necrotic cellular debris in the lumina of terminal bronchioles (Fig. 4) . No hybridization signal was detected in bronchial or bronchiolar epithelium.

Destruction of pulmonary macrophages by replicating PRRSV is an indication of a direct pathogenic effect of the virus. Such changes affect adversely the antibacterial defence of the lung and probably predispose to common secondary bacterial infections, as seen in piglets no. 3 and 4. Secondary bacterial infections are commonly reported in PRRSV-infected pigs (Dee and Joo, 1994; Mengeling et al., 1994) . The possible role of other respiratory cells, such as type 2 pneumocytes, in the replication of PRRSV in the lung has been previously demonstrated by immunohistochemical methods (Magar et al., 1993; Halbur et al., 1994) . PRRSV nucleic acids or antigens have been detected in type 2 pneumocytes in formalin-fixed sections of lungs by in-situ hybridization (Sur et al., 1996) and in frozen sections of lungs by indirect immunofluorescence . Our study further confirmed replication of PRRSV in the lung. We were unable to detect PRRSV nucleic acids in bronchiolar epithelium. The use of non-radioactive in-situ hybridization to study infectious diseases is one of the most promising applications of this technique (Crabb et al., 1992) .",
