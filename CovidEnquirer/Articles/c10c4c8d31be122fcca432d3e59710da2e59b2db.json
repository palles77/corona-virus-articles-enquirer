Results show that MB degradation by the VUV/UV/PS process was significantly higher than that of the conventional UV/PS process, as the VUV photolysis of H2O and PS generated more reactive oxygen species (ROSs). HO \u2022 and SO4 \u2022-, identified as the main ROSs, were mostly consumed by dissolved organic carbon and Clin real waters, respectively. Additionally, the impacts of solution pH and the concentrations of PS, humic acid, and inorganic ions (HCO3 -, Cl -, NO3 -, SO4 2-, Fe(II), and Fe(III)) were systematically evaluated. The solution pH significantly affected the photon absorption distributions, as well as the contributions of photolysis and oxidation to MB degradation, resulting in different variations in the degradation rate constant and total organic carbon removal ratio with increasing solution pH. At all tested pH levels (3.0-11.0), particularly under acidic conditions, HO \u2022 and SO4 \u2022were two predominant contributors to MB degradation, while VUV and UV photolysis contributed more when the solution pH increased.

Additionally, the pH impact on the photon absorption distributions was explored to understand the roles of direct photolysis (VUV and UV) and indirect oxidation by various oxidants at different pH levels.

The required levels of target parent pollutant and TOC (or chemical oxygen demand) removal in practical water treatment differ. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms behind the different trends of k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS and TOC removal ratio at various pH levels, which could be useful for selecting an economic treatment strategy according to the specific requirements of a certain scenario (this is discussed in detail in Section 3.6).

Under the tested pH of 3.0-11.0, indirect HO \u2022 and SO4 \u2022oxidation mainly contributed to MB degradation. However, with an increase in the solution pH, the roles of direct VUV and UV photolysis became more important.

Therefore, most of the VUV photons participated in the photodecomposition of H2O and PS to yield HO \u2022 and SO4 \u2022-, respectively, during the VUV/UV/PS process, rather than partaking in the direct photolysis of MB, which absorbed 6.6% of the VUV photons.
