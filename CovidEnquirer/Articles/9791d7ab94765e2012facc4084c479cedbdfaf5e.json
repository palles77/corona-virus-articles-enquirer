With limited resources for research available, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies for reorganising PHC delivery, determine where relevant evidence gaps exist and prioritise these for future study. This paper describes an approach for doing this using the best available evidence combined with consultation to establish evidence priorities. We first reviewed PHC organisational interventions in Asia-Pacific LMICs and ascertained evidence gaps. The largest gaps related to interventions to promote access to essential medicines, patient management tools, effective health promotion strategies and service planning and accountability. Evidence from Pacific Island countries was particularly scant. We then engaged an expert panel of 22 PHC stakeholders from seven Asia-Pacific LMICs in a Delphi exercise to identify priority questions for future research. Research priorities were: (1) identifying effective PHC service delivery models for chronic diseases; (2) devising sustainable models of disease integration; (3) optimising task shifting; (4) understanding barriers to care continuity; (5) projecting future PHC needs; and (6) designing appropriate PHC service packages. Notably, stakeholder-determined priorities reflected large, contextdependent system issues, while evidence gaps centred on discrete interventions. Future research on the organisation of PHC services in Asia-Pacific LMICs should incorporate codesign principles to engage researchers and national PHC system stakeholders, and innovative methods that build on existing evidence and account for system complexity.",

The growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCD), combined with an intensifying risk of infectious disease outbreaks, presents a 'double threat' to fragile health systems of LMICs of the Asia-Pacific region. Here, NCDs account for 80% of all deaths and 50% of premature deaths, 3 4 a result of longevity, increasing urbanisation, economic growth and lifestyle factors. At the same time, outbreaks of emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003), 5 Influenza A (2009) 6 and Zika (2016) 7 are likely to continue. A robust PHC system underpins a nation's ability to promote population health, and remain resilient in times of crisis. Yet PHC systems in many Asia-Pacific LMICs are the 'poor cousins' of the hospital system. 8 Designed primarily to provide episodic care for acute disease management, they often struggle to manage long-term conditions, deliver preventive health activities or to integrate care across diseases.

We aimed to recruit stakeholders from government, aid/development organisations, academic institutions and civil society from a broad sample of Asia-Pacific LMICs, to seek their perspectives on, and prioritisation of, PHC research gaps. Stakeholders were identified through the authors' existing networks and snowball sampling. Despite the authors' strong network of China stakeholders, we discovered just prior to the initiation of the eDelphi exercise that firewall restrictions would preclude access to the survey website for China-based participants. Because of time constraints in administering the three rounds of the Delphi, we were unable to rebuild the survey using local Chinese online survey software. An iterative prioritisation process was undertaken, involving three rounds of web-based survey using a web-based data collection tool (Research Electronic Data Capture). This virtual method of expert engagement has been successfully applied elsewhere and is applicable where Delphi panel members are geographically dispersed. 24 25 We recruited 22 participants to the expert panel (179 email invitations sent; 13% response rate). These included representatives from seven LMICs of the Asia-Pacific region, and seven individuals working across regional PHC programmes (table 1) . Panel members were asked to complete each Delphi round within 10 days with automated email reminders prior to each round closing.

PHC, primary health care. disease programme integration; projecting healthcare needs of the future; and integrating primary, secondary and tertiary care across the health sector. There was also a clear gap in the literature in this area, with the small number of interventional studies identified being primarily focused on testing 'community consultation' as an approach to optimising coverage and responsiveness in PHC service planning. Research on how to strengthen the systems that support the organisation, management and oversight of services-for example, planning, resource allocation, performance management-was also rare. Notably, questions prioritised by the panel represent a 'big picture' framing of planning and accountability issues yet neglect mechanisms to support planning decisions (eg, use of routine health service data) and health workforce and service accountability. This may reflect stakeholder scepticism that a research study can generate practical insights into issues that essentially require improved management and leadership. Five of the top 10 research questions prioritised by the Delphi panel addressed the PHC system input category of service delivery models. Questions related to: effective service delivery models for chronic diseases; how to use task shifting (through non-physician health workers (NPHW)) to best support PHC service delivery; addressing barriers to continuity of care; determining an effective package of PHC services; and the optimum mix of health workers at primary care level. While studies on service delivery models did dominate the relatively small evidence base, the majority were narrowly focused on the delivery of a specific intervention. Again, there was a notable contrast between the discrete intervention focus of research to date and the system-focused research priorities of the regional stakeholders. Another prioritised question, on the impact on NPHWs of integrating new programmes into their work routines, also reflected stakeholder interest in determining effective workforce development strategies to optimise team-based PHC functioning. This knowledge gap converged with the findings of the evidence mapping process and has been highlighted elsewhere as a key enabler to successful integration of front-line health services. 26 Despite the void of evidence relating to improving access to essential medicines, vaccines and technologies, and health promotion, the Delphi expert panel rated only one research question in these areas as high priority: how do we ensure that essential drugs and diagnostics are always available in PHC services? This might reflect the absence of representation of PHC service providers on the expert panel, as well as the small number of government BMJ Global Health stakeholders completing the Delphi final rounds (2/14 panel members; none of who were health service planners or managers).",

We were therefore limited by the small Delphi panel size (only 22/179 (13%) invited participants agreed to join and 14/22 (64%) original panel members completed rounds 2 and 3). The initial response rate is reflective of response rates previously achieved by web-based Delphi research, 24 and is a notable drawback of this virtual method of engagement that should be considered alongside benefits of efficiency and geographical reach. We were thus unable to highlight regional variation in priority evidence needs and reliably determine the areas of concordance and discordance between the literature-informed evidence gaps and stakeholder research priorities. The inability to include China stakeholders represents a significant limitation, particularly given the predominance of evidence from China PHC systems. Alternative approaches to engaging China PHC stakeholders in priority setting activities, including roundtable discussions or the face-to-face nominal group technique, are proposed in the future. Lack of expert panel representation from Pacific Island countries in the latter stages of the Delphi process also weakens the geographic relevance of identified research priorities. Clearly, the findings would need to be corroborated with both deeper engagement with panel members (perhaps through in-depth interviews) and broader engagement with a larger number of stakeholders from across the region.",

Lack of evidence on the impact of front-line health service integration, as well as the necessary preconditions for achieving it, continues to impair the ability of decision makers and planners to assess integration preparedness in their setting, and limits knowledge of effective strategies to achieve sustainable integration. 26 In the Asia-Pacific, there is a particular need for knowledge of how to effectively consolidate existing vertically funded programmes and operationalise the delivery of an integrated package of PHC services, including care for chronic NCDs. Again, embedded research conducted in partnership with policymakers and implementers (including non-government service providers) is necessary to ensure generative learning and allow flexibility to iterate and adapt integration strategies over time.",

Equally, looking beyond the economic dimensions of equity, related to income poverty, to include other types of marginalised and vulnerable populations, including those living in remote and underserved areas, would address a key gap in the evidence base. As with future studies on processes related to planning, delivery and accountability, there is scope for research that examines the political/distal determinants of health equity using a multidisciplinary approach and drawing on social science methodologies in particular. The Pacific is clearly an under-represented region in global PHC evidence; given its unique service delivery challenges of small island states and remote populations, further research from the Pacific Island context is especially warranted.",

Here, we present a PHC research agenda shaped by regional PHC stakeholder perspectives, and reflect on disparities between the presently sparse evidence base and national evidence priorities. Across each of the five recommended focus areas, a major boost to PHC systems research and research capacity in the Pacific region is critical. The organisation of PHC services is chronically understudied in these small island nations and work across any PHC research domain would represent new knowledge and value add to the evidence base. We encourage a process of codesign between researchers, end-users and decision makers to align PHC research priorities from the outset. We also advocate for use of pragmatic but rigorous research methods that account for PHC system complexity, to accelerate regional learning and transferability of successful interventions. Doing so will help ensure that research investment meets the evidence needs of decision makers, and that findings are both useful and used. open access This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited, appropriate credit is given, any changes made indicated, and the use is non-commercial.
