            "text": "Transportation amongst cities is found as one of the main factors which affect the outbreak of diseases. To understand the effect of transport-related infection on disease spread, an SEIRS (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) epidemic model for two cities is formulated and analyzed. The epidemiological threshold, known as the basic reproduction number, of the model is derived. If the basic reproduction number is below unity, the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. Thus, the disease can be eradicated from the community. There exists an endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable if the reproduction number is larger than unity. This means that the disease will persist within the community. The results show that transportation among regions will change the disease dynamics and break infection out even if infectious diseases will go to extinction in each isolated region without transport-related infection. In addition, the result shows that transport-related infection intensifies the disease spread if infectious diseases break out to cause an endemic situation in each region, in the sense of that both the absolute and relative size of patients increase. Further, the formulated model is applied to the real data of SARS outbreak in 2003 to study the transmission of disease during the movement between two regions. The results show that the transport-related infection is effected to the number of infected individuals and the duration of outbreak in such the way that the disease becomes more endemic due to the movement between two cities. This study can be helpful in providing the information to public health authorities and policy maker to reduce spreading disease when its occurs.",

            "text": "The spread of infectious diseases between discrete geographic regions (or cities) is a phenomenon that involves many different compartments. To control the spread of an infectious disease, one has to understand how the growth and spread of the disease affect its outbreak. There are many factors that lead to the dynamics of an infectious disease of humans. They include such human behaviors as population dislocations, living styles, sexual practices and rising international travel. In current, population dispersal by human transportation plays an important role in the spread of infectious disease around the world. SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) spread along the routes of international air travel and infection was carried to many places [33, 34] . Khan et al. [14] pointed out a correlation between inter-regional spread of a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus and travelers. From these observations a number of authors have proposed epidemic models describing disease transmission dynamics among multiple locations due to the population dispersal (see [3, 4, 10, [23] [24] [25] [26] [29] [30] [31] [32] and the references therein). Recently, Cui et al. [7] have proposed a SIS epidemic model to understand the effect of transport related infection on disease spread. Takeuchi et al. [27] proved the global dynamics of model in [7] . They found that the global stabilities of equilibria disease-free and endemic equilibriums, still required additional condition besides the condition for their existence. Considering entry screening and exit screening to detect infected individuals, Liu and Takeuchi [20] proposed an SIQS model to study the effect of transport-related infection and entry screening. Subsequently, Liu and Zhou [21] analyzed global stability of an SIRS epidemic model with transport-related infection. Their results shown transport-related infection can make the disease endemic even if both the isolated regions are disease free. Obviously, the models in [7, 20, 27] assumed that a susceptible individual becomes infectious immediately after infected. However, for many diseases, a host stays in a latent period before becoming infectious after infected, Wan and Cui [29] formulated an SEIS epidemic model to describe the transmission of infectious diseases related by transports. When the individuals have immunity to the disease after recover, the SEIR or SEIRS models are more general than the SEI or SEIS types depending on whether the acquired immunity is permanent or otherwise. These kinds of models have These kinds of models have been studied to gain insights into the transmission dynamics of disease in community. For example, Greenhalgh [11] considered an SEIR model that incorporates density dependence in the death rate. Cooke and Driessche [6] introduced and analyzed the SEIRS model with two delays. Greenhalgh [12] studied Hopf bifurcations in the SEIRS type models with density dependent contact rate and death rate. Li and Muldowney [16] and Li et al. [17] studied the global dynamics of the SEIR models with a non-linear incidence rate as well as standard incidence rate. Li et al. [18] analyzed the global dynamics of the SEIR model with vertical transmission and a bilinear incidence. Recently, Zhang and Ma [36] analyzed the global dynamics of the SEIR model with saturating contact rate. However, those models have not applied to real data of outbreak to investigate the effect of transport-related infection when individuals travel among two cities.",

Simulations are ob- The values of b, c and d correspond to life expectancy of 80 years [13] , an average incubation period of 6.4 days and infectious period of approximately 4 days [9] , respectively. The rate of SARS induced mortality is 0.0079 day \u00c01 [13] . The rate k is progression from infective to diagnosed and is set to be 1/3 day \u00c01 [5] . Fig. 9 shows that the number of susceptible individuals decrease whereas the number of exposed, infected and recovered individuals increase. This means that when the disease spread occurs, the number of susceptible individuals decrease since the susceptible individuals contact with infected individuals. Thus, susceptible individuals can require exposed individuals. After 2-10 days [9], the exposed individuals is progression to symptoms development, therefore, exposed individual is called infected individuals. After that infected individuals is hospitalized about 3-5 days [9] and then infected individuals is becomes recovered individuals. It can be concluded that SARS is highly infectious base on the gradient of the susceptible curve. Fig. 10 shows the predicted total cases obtained by (4.18 Next, an SEIRS model with transport-related infection (2.5) is applied to study the dynamic of SARS during the movement among two cities. It is assumed that the all individuals can travel from one city to another city at the rate a 1 . It is also assumed that both cities are identical, i.e. the demographic are the same for each city. When the disease spread occurs, the disease is transmitted with transition rate ca 1 . Thus, the effect of transport-related infection, c, is monitored to forecast the total number of infected individuals and duration of its outbreak. In this case the model (2.5) is simulated by using parameter values a 1 \u00bc 0:9 and various values of c: c \u00bc 0, c \u00bc 0:2 and c \u00bc 1, whilst retaining the same values of other parameters in the previous experiment. The initial conditions are used S 1 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1; 100, E 1 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 95, I 1 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 95, R 1 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0, C 1 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 95, S 2 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1; 100, E 2 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 5, I 2 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 5, R 2 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0, C 2 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0. The cumulative number of cases and trajectory of infected individuals, in two cities, are shown in Figs. 11,12 , respectively. The results show that the total number of SARS in both cities increases with increase of c (see Fig. 11 ). It is also seen that the maximum number of infected individuals are 130, 150, 240 and the outbreak reached its peak about 22 days, 20 days, 10 days as c increase, c \u00bc 0, c \u00bc 0:2, c \u00bc 1, respectively (see Fig. 12 ). This confirms that the size and duration of an outbreak can be influenced by transport-related infection. Thus, to reduction and to prevention the spread of SARS, it should have the control measure of the traveling of individual from one city to another city.",

When there is the movement of exposed and infectious individuals between two cities, the SEIRS model with transport related infection (2.5) is used to investigate the outbreak of SARS when the individuals in one city travel to another city. The results show that the transport-related infection is effected to the number of infected individuals and the duration of outbreak in such the way that the disease becomes more endemic due to the movement between two cities. This study can be helpful in providing the information to public health authorities and policy maker to reduce spreading disease when its occurs. However, the results of the model (2.5) has not yet forecasted the real size of the SARS epidemics in two city and one can see that in the model (2.5) , it is assumed that the two regions share an identical parameter set. It may be necessary to consider two different population sizes and different dispersal rates in order to discuss precisely the impact of the transport-related infection on the disease dynamics. Moreover, to make the model more realistic, gravity models introduced by Murray and Cliff [15] is applied. We leave these to future work.",
