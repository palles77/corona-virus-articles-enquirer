Although fi rst localized in the upper-respiratory tract (URT), these infections could trigger a cascade of infl ammatory events 1,2 that lead to clinically signifi cant exacerbations. Current guidelines recommend the administration of antibiotics based mainly on clinical criteria, 1 leading inevitably to an overuse of antibiotics, which is estimated to occur in approximately 55% of all acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). 3 The participation of viral infections in AECOPD has been confi rmed in many studies. 4-7 The most recent reports using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods led to a positive detection of viral nucleic acids in 30% to 60% of AECOPD cases. 5,8-12 However, the role of recently identifi ed viruses, such as coronavirus NL63 and HKU1 and human bocavirus as well as the new human rhinoviruses C, which are reported as the most frequent ones circulating in the community, 13, 14 has not yet been fully established.",

            "text": "The clinical relevance of viral or bacterial infection identifi ed through URT sampling (vs sputum samples), is indeed debated. 27 However, in clinical settings, representative sputum during AECOPD often is diffi cult to obtain. Furthermore, bacterial colonization may contaminate and thus inhibit viral culture in sputum samples as well as RT-PCR, and RT-PCR assays using sputum face other technical limitations, such as lack of standardization and unknown reproducibility. In addition, potentially pathogenic viruses rarely found in lower airways, such as bocavirus or rhinovirus, would be overlooked if searched only in sputum. Many of these limitations can be overcome by nasopharyngeal sampling, which demands only very limited patient collaboration. Finally, the nasopharyngeal area is considered the most appropriate site for detecting viral replication, and lower respiratory tract replication in absence of URT infection is exceptional. 28 To determine whether upper-respiratory viral infection is a causative agent of AECOPD is of major importance. Indeed, detection of viral nucleic acids in upper-respiratory secretions is not proof per se of a causal relationship, but there is substantial evidence 2 supporting the role of respiratory viruses in promoting infl ammatory processes leading to exacerbation. It is also established that viruses, such as RSV, may directly infect the lower airway in patients with COPD. 29 The causal relationship between a viral infection initiated in the upper-respiratory tract and exacerbation has been demonstrated in a small experimental study in which four patients with stable COPD were infected with rhinoviruses. 30 Thus, viruses detected in nasopharyngeal swab of patients with AECOPD do play a role in the development of respiratory symptoms either alone or as cofactors with other pathogens or nonbiologic agents, such as air pollution or tobacco smoke. 2 Importantly, the concordance between nasopharyngeal swabs and lower-respiratory tract sampling has been found to be high, particularly for respiratory viruses. 31, 32 Additionally, viruses detected in URT have been suspected to be causal agents in community-acquired pneumonia. 33 Viral infection was cleared in most cases during the 4-month follow-up, and we did not observe prolonged viral shedding as reported in some studies. 12 Prolonged shedding has been mainly described for RSV, and the small number of cases observed in our study viral samples, unlike in most previous studies, 5, 6, 9, 10 were not only collected during the acute exacerbation phase but also systematically collected several months after the initial exacerbation, with patients being their own controls. It is noteworthy that neither clinical features nor outcomes differed significantly between patients with or without viral infection, albeit for URT symptoms, more frequently in positive cases as already described. 12 In our study, picornaviruses, metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses were the most common identifi ed, which is consistent with recent studies. 5, [10] [11] [12] 24 Of note, the RT-PCR assays used in our study did not discriminate between rhinoviruses and other enteroviruses. However, based on previous investigations, it can be surmised that rhinoviruses represented the large majority of these cases. This strategy also offered the advantage of screening for newly identifi ed strains, such as rhinovirus C and other new respiratory enteroviruses. 14,23 RT-PCR assays have already shown their ability to improve diagnostic yield in different as CRP, are elevated during COPD exacerbations, 2,36 but the association between viral infections and systemic infl ammation biomarkers has been addressed only in a few studies until now. 2, 12 We thus tested the performance of CRP and PCT for this indication. In AECOPD, PCT-based guidelines may lead to a decreased use of antibiotics. 37 In practice, when PCT values are below a predefi ned limit, many clinicians consider that viruses, not bacteria, cause AECOPD. Our results did not show any correlation between either CRP or PCT values and sputum cultures or results of virological screening, and neither of these biomarkers could effi ciently discriminate between these two types of infection. It is possible that a lack of power might explain these results, as our study was not properly powered to detect differences in PCT precludes any further conclusions. We can hypothesize, however, that the seasonal pattern of RSV epidemics, varying substantially every year, might explain this discrepancy. Indeed, several studies, even in Switzerland, have reported a biennial activity of RSV that could underestimate its prevalence in our COPD population study compared with other studies. 34, 35 The high rate of virus detection in URT during AECOPD also supports the idea that antibiotics may be overprescribed in these patients 3 and that distinguishing between purely viral infections and mixed or bacterial infections is of major importance. The present study offered the advantage of an extensive molecular viral screening in a well-defi ned clinical entity (AECOPD) known to be associated with both bacterial and viral infections. Biologic markers, such long as 8 to 11 days after AECOPD, 30 we believe that the reported rate of viral infection is reliable. Finally, the lack of relation in our study between recovery time and detection of viruses also could be explained by the fact that patients were mainly referred by their physician and that it was diffi cult to determine precisely the exact start of the exacerbation because the thresholds for referral differ between physicians. This refl ects the diffi culties encountered in real-life management of patients with COPD.",

It is quite possible that our study underestimated the rate of bacterial infection or coinfection in as much as sputum samples for bacterial analysis were available in only 45% of cases, and 57% of these patients had already received antibiotics. Conversely, our bacterial assays were only semiquantitative, and we did not perform bacterial detection at follow-up. Because bacterial colonization is common in patients with COPD, the possible identifi cation of bacteria in AECOPD does not necessarily imply an etiologic role. This fi nding may have affected values of biomarkers and clinical outcome. Additionally, patients were not recruited at the very onset of AECOPD and may have passed the peak viral load, which could have underestimated the real prevalence of virus-related AECOPD.
