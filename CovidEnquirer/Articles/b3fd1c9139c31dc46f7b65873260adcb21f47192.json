This study assessed the economic impact of influenza-like illness (ILI) on families with children attending childcare using a societal perspective. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study in 90 childcare centres and one general practitioner clinic in Sydney, Australia, during 2010. Healthy children aged \u22656 months to <3 years were enrolled. Economic impacts of ILI (temperature \u226537\u00c18\u00b0C or parental report of fever, plus \u22651 respiratory symptoms) were collected at 2 and 4 weeks after ILI onset by telephone interview. Parent-collected respiratory specimens were tested for respiratory viruses using realtime PCR (RT-PCR). Costs associated with healthcare visits, medication usage, carer time lost (work or recreation) and home care and/or additional childcare were collected. Influenza-like illness costs were described and further analysed using a Tobit model. Zero-inflated Poisson regression was employed to compare the numbers of healthcare visits for each ILI.",

An ILI in a child with working parents and/or with longer duration appears to cost more in monetary terms. Healthcare visits were increased if the child was non-Caucasian, lived in a detached house, had working parents or had a virus-positive ILI. Our findings on the estimates and determinants of economic impacts from respiratory virus infection highlight the importance and feasibility of an interdisciplinary (epidemiology/health economics) approach to such research.",

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 50% of children aged three attend childcare, with an average attendance of 17 hours per week, and 13% of children attending 35 hours or more a week. 6 According to the National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines in Australia, 7 children with influenza-like illness (ILI) need to be excluded from childcare until they have recovered.",

The duration of ILI was defined as the number of days between the 1st day when the child fulfilled the ILI definition and the day when all the symptoms disappeared, inclusive. If a child still had symptoms on the 2nd follow-up telephone call (at 26-32 days), we calculated the ILI duration as difference between the date of the phone call and the ILI onset date.",

Cost of illness did not vary by the type of virus identified. It may be that costs of ILIs in children attending childcare were less affected by virus type, due to the almost uniform requirement for at least one parent to have time away from work (if both work) regardless of severity. In our study, having both parents in employed work and having a longer ILI duration were (perhaps predictably) the key cost drivers. Four variables appeared to be associated with increased number of healthcare visits for ILI: being non-Caucasian, living in a detached house, having working parents (i.e. both) and having an ILI that is positive for at least one virus. Our findings are largely applicable to urban families with a child attending organised childcare. Strengths of our study include regular reminders to carers to identify any ILIs in the study child by weekly contact. In addition, parent-collected swabs and sensitive RT-PCR for virus identification enabled sensitive detection of outcome parameters; we also achieved a high swabbing rate [94% (117/124) of the ILI episodes]. Our study was observational and study staff did not provide medical care for study child, reducing the likelihood of a Hawthorne effect artificially reducing ILI costs.

Most (89%) study children attended childcare, and compared with the general Australian population, 14 study households had higher income (Table 2) , leading to an under-representation of lower-income households. Previous Australian research has shown that the highest mean acute respiratory illness (ARI) cost-of-illness values are not necessarily associated with the highest income households, reducing the likelihood our study population may have upwardly biased mean ILI costs. In addition, as shown in Table 2 , the mothers in our study were slightly older (33 years compared with 30 years in the general population 17 ) and they were more likely to live with a partner (married or de facto) (97% versus 88%). 18 This study showed a low prevalence of A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2010. We believe this is partly because we did not start collecting ILI data until 30 July 2010, thus, some winter cases of influenza may have been missed. Surveillance data revealed that the 2010 influenza peak was September in the state where we conducted the study (NSW), 19 but the incidence of influenza in 2010 was relatively low. 19 It is noteworthy that we used a relatively comprehensive approach to collect information on the costs of ILI, and our study reinforced the importance of indirect costs in economic assessment of infectious diseases. Apart from the major cost drivers (i.e. time off work, healthcare visits), we also collected data on other cost items; these included non-antibiotic prescription medication, OTC medications, and paid childcare for other children (in the same household of the ILI child), whilst carers were looking after the sick child, travel costs of healthcare visits and all other costs that the carers recalled. In addition, our study highlighted that the time off recreational activities should be adequately measured because it covered a not insubstantial 19% (3/16 hours) of total time lost.",

Having both parents in paid employment increased the ILI costs probably due to the primary carer and the partner taking time off work to look after the sick child. The lost productivity due to time off work plus costs of recreation time lost accounted for the majority of ILI costs in this study that is consistent with the literature. 20, 21 In our study, particularly where both parents work, even simple ILIs without a GP visit can be costly because of carers' taking time off work. Apart from economic impact, qualitative interviews conducted with a subsample of the carers in this study also demonstrated that these parents have larger quality-of-life impact in terms of daily and social life disruption. 22 To our knowledge, ours is the first study that demonstrates the duration of respiratory infection, when managed outside a hospital, is associated with higher economic costs. This finding may suggest that for future efforts in assessing the economic impacts of a respiratory disease, the measurement of infection duration should be taken into account as a proxy for economic burden. Of the four variables that increased the number of healthcare visits with an ILI, we believe that two of them (living in a detached house and having working parents) are associated with potentially higher socio-economic status. In the literature, it is evident that those of higher economic class are more likely to seek medical visits for their health issues. [23] [24] [25] However, our study did not collect related information to prove the potential link between socioeconomic status and health-seeking behaviours.",

            "text": "In our study, the children with virus-positive ILIs had more healthcare visits than those with no virus detected; however, among the virus-positive ILIs, the number of healthcare visits did not significantly increase with increasing number of viruses identified. The use of RT-PCR has contributed to ongoing discovery/detection of simultaneous multiple respiratory pathogens from a single specimen in one child, 26 but the real impact of these simultaneous detections remains unclear. There are some reports documenting that (i) the single infection of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and (ii) the co-infection of HMPV plus respiratory syncytial virus increase hospitalisation rates, 27, 28 while other studies did not detect an association between a multiple viral infections and illness severity. [29] [30] [31] Future research should endeavour to better correlate clinical/economic disease severity with viral quantity. In valuing the recreation time lost, we used sex-weighted mean income in Australia. There is some controversy on the valuation of recreation time. 32, 33 An economic analysis using a societal perspective requires that all costs resulting from an illness should be taken into account, regardless of who experiences the costs 34 ; thus, we believe measuring and valuing all time spent on an ILI episode are important, including that removed from recreation. The recreation time loss is likely to cause opportunity costs, which needs to be assessed in an economic analysis.",
