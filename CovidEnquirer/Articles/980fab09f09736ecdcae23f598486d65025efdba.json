ApoD-null females displayed progressive bone loss with aging, resulting in a 50% reduction in trabecular bone volume and a 23% reduction in cortical bone volume by 9 months of age. Only cortical bone volume was significantly reduced in ApoD-null males by an average of 24%. Histochemistry indicated significantly higher osteoblast surface and number of osteoclasts in femora from ApoD-null females. ApoD gene expression was confirmed in primary cultures of bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSC), with higher expression levels in MSC from females compared to males. ApoD-null MSC exhibited impaired proliferation and differentiation potentials. Moreover, exogenous ApoD partially rescued the osteogenic potential of null MSC, which were shown to readily uptake the protein from media. ApoD expression was upregulated under low proliferation conditions, by contact inhibition and osteoblastic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells.",

The balance between both processes preserves bone tissue integrity and mineral homeostasis of the organism [1] . Osteoclasts and osteoblasts are specialized cells which respectively break down old bone tissue and promote the formation of new bone matrix. Osteoblasts, under the control of specific transcription factors, sequentially differentiate from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into proliferating preosteoblasts, bone matrix-producing osteoblasts, and eventually into osteocytes embedded within the bone matrix [2] . Differentiated osteoblasts synthesize and secrete type I collagen, the main bone matrix protein, and regulate bone mineralization through expression of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. In addition, these cells orchestrate bone remodeling by regulating the activation and differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts from the monocyte/macrophage lineage [1] . Any imbalance between resorptive and formative functions of these cell populations may lead to excessive bone resorption or inadequate formation, resulting in loss of bone density, lower bone mass and increased risk of bone fractures [3] as observed in osteoporosis.",

            "text": "Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a 29-kDa glycoprotein first isolated from high density lipoprotein (HDL) plasma fractions [4] . Unlike other apolipoproteins, which are essentially produced in liver and intestine, ApoD is mainly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) [5] . Molecular cloning and structural analyses revealed that this protein is part of the lipocalin superfamily [6] . Lipocalins share a conserved 8 beta barrel strand structure, forming a pocket with high affinity for small hydrophobic ligands. Several molecules were identified as potential ligands for ApoD: arachidonic acid, progesterone, pregnenolone, bilirubin, cholesterol and E-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid (reviewed in Ref. [7] ). Binding studies revealed that ApoD is able to discriminate between closely related compounds [8] . Due to this apparent heterogeneity, a role as a 'multi-ligand:multifunction' protein has been proposed [7] . ApoD expression is induced by growth arrest [9, 10] , inflammation and oxidative stress [11, 12] . The CNS was shown to be the major site of ApoD expression in mice and rats [5] and therefore, its physiological functions have mainly been studied in the nervous tissue. In rats, ApoD levels increase considerably in peripheral nervous tissue after experimental nerve injury [13] [14] [15] . In humans, ApoD expression is induced by several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders (for a review [16, 17] ). Thus, there is accumulating evidence suggesting that ApoD plays a protective role in the CNS. Of interest, higher ApoD expression levels are measured in women; moreover, these levels increase with age in women but not in men [18] . The protein is also overexpressed in several types of cancer [19, 20] , in lipid metabolism disorders such as Tangier disease [21] , abetalipoproteinemia [22, 23] , LCAT deficiency [24] , hypertriglyceridemia at birth [25] , and in pathological conditions leading to lipid accumulation such as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) [26, 27] .",

Loss of cortical bone volume was associated to reduce cortical thickness and diameter for both male and female null mice. Calcium and phosphorus plasma levels were measured in 9month-old mice; no difference was noticed for either parameter between wt, tg and null mice (Table 4 ). Total plasma ALP levels were 120% higher in females relatively to males, independently of genotype; this parameter was augmented by 40% in ApoD-null females versus gender-matched wt mice.

Addition of hApoD showed an osteogenic effect on wt cells, and partially rescued the phenotype of null cells. Note that obtaining uniform monolayers of null cells was challenging in the untreated and osteogenic conditions; the presence of hApoD in the medium seemed to correct that situation (Fig. 3C, right panel) . To explore the relationship between ApoD and osteoblastic differentiation, we investigated its expression and secretion in differentiating MC3T3 cells, using a classical ascorbic acid and glycerol-2-phosphaste medium (Fig. 4A) . As shown in Fig. 4B , ApoD gene expression was upregulated over 2-fold at 7 days of osteogenic treatment and onwards. In accordance, ApoD cellular protein levels were increased under these conditions (Fig. 4C, top panel) , showing concomitant increase of ApoD secretion in culture medium (Fig. 4C, bottom panel) . As was performed on MSC, ALP activity was monitored following 21 days in basal or osteogenic medium, or following addition of hApoD (Fig. 4D) . hApoD alone also significantly enhance ALP activity in MC3T3 cells, although not being as potent as regular osteogenic medium.",

As shown in Fig. 5A (left panel) , serum starvation reduced by 15% the number of cells in S and G2/M phases, with a concurrent increase of cells in G1 phase. In accordance, BrdU incorporation was significantly reduced by serum deprivation (Fig. 5A , middle panel).

Low bone volume in ApoD-null females was associated to reduced trabecular thickness and number of trabeculae particularly accentuated with age, hinting that ApoD may play a significant role in age-related bone loss. Histochemical analysis of 9-month-old mouse femora revealed greater relative osteoblast staining and higher number of TRAP-positive cells, suggesting accelerated bone turnover in null females. Mineral plasma homeostasis of 9-month-old null and tg mice was similar to that of wt mice; however, a significant increase in plasma ALP activity was noted in the null females only. Low bone mass accompanied by high serum ALP has been reported in cases of accelerated bone turnover in post-menopausal women [39] . This phenotype bears similarities with aged human bone, which commonly shows reduced wall thickness in histological sections, an index of reduced bone matrix deposition. This condition may be associated to an increased activation frequency of bone remodeling units [40] .",

Higher ApoD gene expression was measured in MSC from females compared to those from male mice, suggesting that ApoD contributes to a higher extent in female bone metabolism, at least as age progresses. In accordance, higher ApoD expression levels in the CNS are also measured in women, and increase with aging in women but not in men [37] . The link between the gender-specific bone effects of ApoD and sex steroids remains unclear. The ApoD promoter shows estrogen response elements and thus, its expression and secretion could be influenced by sex steroids in breast cyst fluid [9, 41] and breast cancer cells [20, 42] . Other gender-specific effects have been reported; for instance, the neuroprotective effect of ApoD against human coronavirus OC43-induced encephalitis is greater in male mice, as they are more sensitive to this infection [43] . Perhaps the ability of ApoD to bind progesterone and pregnenolone might explain some of the gender-related differences. Since ApoD deletion predominantly impacts bone in aged female mice, ovariectomy-induced bone loss in this model could discriminate between ApoD-dependant and hormone-dependant effects.",

This result agrees with the reported ApoD upregulation with osteogenic differentiation of human MSC [28] and mouse primary osteoblasts [30] , as well as high-throughput gene expression profile (biogps.org, ID11815) and microarray analyses of C3H10 cells [29] . Moreover, we report that osteogenic differentiation is associated with increased cellular and secreted ApoD protein levels in MC3T3 cells, arguing for an auto/paracrine function of ApoD in bone metabolism.

Robust energetic demands are placed on mature osteoblasts for matrix secretion and mineralization. In accordance, cellular respiration and mitochondrial activities are increased, likely maintaining higher ATP levels observed in mature osteoblast [45] . Accordingly, antioxidant enzymes manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase were shown to be upregulated in human MSC upon osteogenic differentiation, likely to prevent the accumulation of intracellular ROS. Of note, there is increasing evidence for a prominent neuroprotective role of ApoD because of its antioxidant activity (reviewed in Ref. [46] ). Loss of ApoD function increases, whereas ApoD overexpression reduces sensitivity to oxidative stress, as well as lipid peroxidation in brain tissue after oxidant treatment in mice [12] . Specifically, hApoD has been shown to reduce arachidonic acid hydroperoxides to lipid hydroxides, thus acting as a lipid antioxidant and preventing lipid peroxidation [47] . Therefore, ApoD upregulation during osteogenic differentiation may act as a protection mechanism against oxidative stress. Interestingly, the higher Rankl:Opg ratio and Sod1 expression observed in female-derived null MSC were both rescued by exogenous hApoD, reinforcing the hypothesis of an antioxidant role of ApoD in bone tissue.",

Perhaps the impact of oxidative stress on bone remodeling is biphasic, with low or intermediate levels accelerating bone turnover while high levels impair it altogether. In addition, ApoD may also influence RANKL expression and activation through inflammatory pathways in bone microenvironment. By binding to arachidonic acid, its main ligand, ApoD may restrain its availability. Arachidonic acid is the major precursor of leukotrienes and prostaglandins, two groups of potent inflammatory modulators known to impact bone metabolism [52] . Oxidative stress is known to enhance osteoclastogenesis and inhibit osteoblastogenesis through NF-\u03baBmediated RANKL regulation [35, 49] . It would be of interest to compare the levels of ROS and antioxidant components, as well as Rankl:Opg ratio between ApoD-null and Sod1-null MSC. Evidence from pharmacological and genetic studies in mice has provided support for a deleterious effect of oxidative stress in bone and has strengthened the idea that increased ROS levels with age represent a pathophysiological mechanism underlying age-related bone loss (reviewed in Ref. [50] ).",

Similar ApoD upregulation by growth arrest was observed in human and murine fibroblasts, as well as in various cancer cell lines [9, 10, 11, 51] .

Overall, our results indicate that ApoD contributes to the regulation of bone metabolism in mice and further studies are required to pinpoint its mechanisms.
