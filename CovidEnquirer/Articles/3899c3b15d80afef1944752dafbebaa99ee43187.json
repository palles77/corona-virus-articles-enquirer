            "text": "No single animal model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reproduces all aspects of the human disease. Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation. They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection. Older (12-to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies. We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice. Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation. Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs. Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis. These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells. The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus. Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS. The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology. This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals. Citation: Roberts A, Deming D, Paddock CD, Cheng A, Yount B, et al.

            "text": "The occurrence in late 2002 and early 2003 of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in southeast China quickly drew international attention as the disease sickened more than 8,000 people and spread to more than 30 countries within six months. Since the identification of the etiological agent, the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), in 2003, development and characterization of animal models for evaluation of prophylaxis and treatment strategies have been of great interest. Although SARS-CoV has not been associated with a subsequent widespread outbreak since 2002-2003, the potential for such an outbreak remains. Identification of a SARS-like coronavirus in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus species) that are indigenous across Southeast Asia suggests that they may represent a natural reservoir from which viruses may be introduced into the human population [1] . The course of infection in animal models is abbreviated compared with the course of SARS in humans; however, many aspects of SARS-CoV-associated disease are reproducible in animal models, including age-dependent susceptibility, re-covery of SARS-CoV from respiratory tissues and secretions, infection of type I and type II pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells, detection of viral genome in blood and extrapulmonary tissues, and pulmonary pathology (including pneumonitis, edema, necrotic debris, and hyaline membrane formation) [2, 3] . Clinical symptoms have been reported in some species, but the findings are not entirely reproducible in outbred species. Variability in clinical symptoms seen in outbred species may result from additional factors, including infection with co-pathogens, stress, existence of sub-species of test animals, and use of different virus strains. This variation can be problematic in studies of pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy unless a large enough number of animals are included in each treatment group [2] . The ideal animal model would demonstrate viral replication in respiratory tissues, histopathologic evidence of respiratory disease, and consistent clinical signs of disease, including mortality. A small animal model in which all of these aspects of virus-associated disease are seen would be desirable because reproducible data can be generated in inbred animals, and larger numbers of animals can be included for statistical analysis of biological outcomes.",

Lightly anesthetized mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 5 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) per mouse of SARS-CoV (Urbani). Two to three days post-infection (d.p.i.), when peak viral titers are observed, lungs were harvested from infected mice and clarified homogenates were used as inocula for continued serial passage via intranasal inoculation in mice. To screen for virulence in mice, groups of young na\u00efve mice (N \u00bc 5-8) were inoculated with lung homogenates collected at passage 2, 10, and 15 (P2, P10, and P15, respectively), weighed daily, and observed twice daily for signs of morbidity or mortality. Deaths were not observed following inoculation with P2 or P10; however, increased morbidity, as indicated by weight loss, was noted in P10inoculated mice at day 3 post-infection (p.i.) (unpublished data). Mortality was observed in P15-inoculated mice; 60% of P15-inoculated mice died or displayed extreme morbidity and were euthanized by 5 d.p.i. Mortality was not observed in mice infected with intermediate passages (P11-P14), and accompanying morbidity was not measured (unpublished data). Supernatant from lung homogenates at P15 contained a heterogeneous virus pool as evident upon sequence analysis of cDNA fragments generated by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) amplification from purified viral RNA (vRNA). Dual peaks were observed on sequence chromatograms at several nucleotide residues, indicating mixed populations in the virus pool. To obtain a clonal population, P15 virus was biologically cloned by three rounds of terminal dilution in Vero cells. Five clones were screened for lethality in 6-to 8wk-old BALB/c mice; these clones caused mortality from 50% to 100%. One clone, designated MA15, resulted in 100% mortality within 6 d. BALB/c mice aged 6 to 8 wk, 4 mo, and 13 mo were all susceptible to MA15 infection, with severe morbidity or death occurring within 3 to 5 d following intranasal inoculation.",

The sequence of the initial SARS-CoV (P0) virus was identical to the published SARS-CoV (Urbani) sequence, and six nucleotide substitutions were identified in the MA15 genome compared with that of SARS-CoV (Urbani).

In order to study the disease and evaluate vaccines and antiviral drugs, animal models that mimic the disease are necessary. However, no single animal model for SARS reproduces all aspects of the disease as it affects humans. SARS-CoV replicates in the lungs of young mice, but they do not show signs of illness. Adaptation of SARS-CoV by serial passage in the lungs of mice resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for young mice following intranasal inoculation. Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by hematological changes and pathological changes in the lungs. Mice infected with MA15 virus die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes, and ciliated epithelial cells. The MA15 virus has six coding mutations in its genome, which, when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, confer lethality. The MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with this virus in mice reproduces many aspects of severe human disease, including morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.",

Northern blot analysis of RNA from infected Vero E6 cells indicated that genomic vRNA and viral mRNA and all eight sub-genomic mRNAs were present in similar ratios for the recombinant viruses and MA15 virus as for SARS-CoV (Urbani) ( Figure  2A ). The level of expression and mobility of the structural proteins (S and N) and an accessory protein (ORF 3a, also called X1) of the recombinant viruses and MA15 virus were comparable to those of SARS-CoV (Urbani), as determined by Western blot analysis ( Figure 2B ). Although S, N, and X1 are somewhat reduced in the lane ( Figure 2B ) from icSARS-CoVinfected cultures, this is associated with reduced amounts of total protein added to the well, rather than with any specific reduction in X1 expression. Thus, the recombinant viruses (rMA15 SM , rMA15 ORF1ab , rMA15, and icSARS-CoV) and the MA15 virus demonstrate no defects in replication or in RNA or protein expression compared with SARS-CoV (Urbani) in Vero E6 cells.",

These changes were especially evident in pneumocytes, and many detached, pyknotic, and necrotic cells were identified in alveolar spaces ( Figure 6A ). Inflammatory infiltrates, although consistently identified, were generally similar in intensity to those observed in the lungs of SARS-CoV (Urbani)-infected mice ( Figure 4) . However, the distribution and amount of viral antigens identified by IHC was far greater in the lungs of MA15-infected mice than in the lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoV (Urbani) ( Figure 5 ). Intracellular SARS-CoV antigens were extensively and abundantly distributed in bronchiolar epithelium, alveolar pneumocytes, and in necrotic debris within the alveoli and bronchiole lumens of MA15-infected mice ( Figure 6C and 6D) .",

The virulence and lethality of the MA15 virus result from six mutations in the SARS-CoV genome that occurred within 15 passages through BALB/c mice. Introduction of these six mutations into a recombinant SARS-CoV infectious clone, rMA15, conferred a lethal phenotype on the virus for young BALB/c mice. Five of these six mutations (not including the T67A mutation occurring in the non-structural protein [nsp] 9 of ORF 1ab) occur within nsp 5 (two mutations), nsp 13, S, and M. These genes have been reported as ones where sequence evolution occurred during adaptation of SARS-CoV in humans [7] . The mutations in nsp 9, nsp 5 (H133Y and E269A within the main protease, 3CL pro ), and nsp 13 (A4V within the helicase protein) do not occur within any known functional domains and do not alter known cleavage sites utilized in the processing of the ORF 1ab polyprotein. Furthermore, the mutations in the MA15 virus do not occur at any specific amino acid positions identified by the Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium [7] . Only the mutation in S (Y436H) occurs within a known functional domain, the receptor-binding motif (RBM). Other reports have indicated that mutations within the RBM may account for increased affinity of the virus for its cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 [8] . However, the Y436H mutation in MA15 virus does not occur at previously identified sites of the RBM and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 interaction, and preliminary findings suggest that the Y436H mutation does not increase binding of the SARS-CoV (Tor2) RBD to murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [9] . Reports of adaptation of an influenza A virus for increased virulence in mice indicate that multiple gene products may interact or contribute independently to virulence. In one adaptation of influenza A/FM/1/47 (FM-MA), findings indicated that four viral gene segments contributed to increased virulence [4] , but additional analyses indicated that mutations occurring in at least two and likely three gene products acted synergistically to account for the increased virulence [10] [11] [12] . Recombinant icSARS-CoV produced mild pneumonia identified by X-ray changes in macaques, similar to the clinical disease noted with wild-type SARS-CoV (Urbani) [13] . Consistent with these findings, recombinant SARS-CoV bearing the six novel mouse-adapted mutations, rMA15, recapitulated a fatal respiratory disease phenotype in mice, demonstrating the ability of the SARS molecular clones to capture complex disease phenotypes. We generated two other recombinant SARS-CoVs, rMA15 SM (encoding the two mutations in the S and M genes) and rMA15 ORF1ab (encoding the four mutations in ORF 1ab). Neither of these was lethal ( Table 2) in BALB/c mice, indicating that SARS-CoV adaptation for BALB/c mice involves mutations in at least two and possibly three genes (S \u00fe ORF 1ab, M \u00fe ORF 1ab, or S \u00fe M \u00fe ORF 1ab). Although recombinant viruses bearing two or four of the mutations were not lethal, each had a different phenotype than that of SARS-CoV (Urbani). It is possible that the mutations in S and M contribute to increased viremia ( Figure S2 ) and that the mutations in ORF 1ab contribute to increased pathogenicity indicated by weight loss (Table 2) .",

Unlike SARS-CoV-infected mice, in which viral antigen is detected by IHC staining at modest levels in bronchial epithelium and in alveolar pneumocytes on days 1 and 2 p.i., the bronchial epithelium of MA15-infected mice is replete with viral antigen at day 1 p.i., as are alveolar pneumocytes on days 1 and 2 p.i. By day 3 p.i., viral antigen is rarely detected in the In this model, day 3 to day 4 p.i. seems to be a critical time for the outcome of SARS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV (Urbani)-infected mice demonstrate a pronounced but transient interstitial inflammation at day 3 p.i. that is absent in MA15infected mice. This transient inflammation is not associated with significant weight loss but coincides with the beginning of viral clearance from the lungs. In contrast, by day 3 p.i., MA15 virus-infected mice lose weight, and necrotic cellular debris begins to fill the bronchioles and alveoli. By day 4 p.i., MA15-infected mice have lost in excess of 20% of their initial body weight, and several die without other overt clinical signs such as ataxia, paralysis, hunched posture, etc. Viral titers in lungs of MA15-infected mice are up to 1,000-fold higher than those in SARS-CoV-infected mice by 24 h.p.i. and remain higher than peak levels in SARS-CoV-infected mice through day 4 p.i. In situ hybridization further confirms the intense and persistent signal of MA15 (and rMA15) vRNA in lung tissues at day 4 p.i. when vRNA from SARS-CoV (Urbani) and the non-lethal rMA15 SM and rMA15 ORF1ab viruses are less abundant ( Figure S3 ). Objective data related to respiratory distress such as plethysmography and measurement of blood gases could not be collected because of practical and logistical constraints on experiments carried out in an Animal Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. However, our findings indicate that MA15 virus-infected mice die as a result of overwhelming pulmonary viral infection and destruction of bronchiolar epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes. Viral load in SARS cases was an important determinant of severe disease and death [14] , but the mechanism of disease leading to fatal outcome in human cases of SARS may be different than that observed in MA15-infected BALB/c mice. The mechanism of death following SARS-CoV infection in humans, and particularly the relative contribution of virusinduced damage and immunopathology, are not fully under- Four weeks after immunization, mice were challenged intranasally with 50 lL MA15 virus (10 6.9 TCID 50 /mouse), weighed daily, and observed twice daily for morbidity and mortality. Surviving mice that lost in excess of 20% initial body weight were euthanized. Symbols represent mean values for SARS-CoV-immunized mice (triangles) and mock-immunized mice (circles). Error bars indicate standard error. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.0030005.g007 stood. The histopathology documented in the mice infected with the MA15 virus includes a rapid progression and extensive damage to bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells ( Figure 6A and 6B ), but it does not show some features such as alveolar edema and hyaline membranes that were reported in many SARS-CoV-infected patients, or in aged mice infected with the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV [15] . This can be explained by the relative virulence of the MA15 strain, and the time p.i. when the lungs were evaluated. Mice infected with the MA15 virus developed severe morbidity and died within 3 to 5 d following infection and did not survive long enough to show progression of the diffuse alveolar damage seen in aged mice or in human patients, who survive for a relatively prolonged length of time before succumbing to complications of the acute infection. In aged mice following SARS-CoV infection, histopathologic changes indicative of progressive diffuse alveolar damage, including proteinaceous deposits around alveolar walls and intraalveolar edema, are seen beginning on day 5 [15] .",

            "text": "In BALB/c mice infected with MA15 virus or SARS-CoV, significant lymphopenia and neutrophilia were observed compared with pre-infection levels. MA15 virus-infected mice had significantly greater lymphopenia and neutrophilia than SARS-CoV-infected mice, reflecting hematological evidence of increased disease severity following MA15 virus infection. MA15 virus-infected mice also had significantly higher levels of ALP than uninfected or SARS-CoV-infected mice. Elevated levels of ALP, an enzyme found in all tissues, but especially concentrated in the liver, may indicate cell destruction in the liver, intestines, or other tissues. Reports of elevated ALP levels in SARS patients are rare [17, 18] , but neutrophilia and lymphopenia have been reported frequently in human cases of SARS [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Although steroid treatment and secondary bacterial infections may be speculated to be the cause of neutrophilia, some patients with SARS had neutrophilia prior to initiation of steroid treatment and in the absence of bacterial infections [26] . Additionally, elevated absolute neutrophil counts at presentation were independent indicators of severe outcome of SARS in human cases [21, 27, 28] . The definitive causes of lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and elevated ALP levels have not been identified in human cases of SARS or in this mouse model.",

Quantitative virology was the only outcome measure available in young BALB/c mice challenged with SARS-CoV (Urbani). Because the MA15 virus replicates rapidly to high titer and is lethal for young BALB/c mice, this virus provides a more stringent challenge than the SARS-CoV (Urbani) virus in evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions or prevention strategies. Prophylaxis that is able to rescue MA15-infected mice from a lethal outcome must lower viral burden in lungs very rapidly (e.g., within the first 24 h). Prophylaxis that accomplishes such reduction in the burden of MA15 virus may also reduce the severity of immunopathology that follows. A reduction of immunopathology was demonstrated in a SARS-CoV hamster model when a monoclonal antibody specific to SARS-CoV spike protein administered the day after infection was able to arrest a further rise in viral titer in the lungs [29] . If similar protection can be demonstrated against challenge with MA15 virus in BALB/c mice, the efficacy of intervention will be well proven.",

In brief, for each mutation two overlapping amplicons were generated by PCR, joined at primerintroduced BsmBI sites, and ligated into a cDNA of icSARS-CoV using two unique restriction sites that flanked the mutation of interest. PCR reactions were performed with Expand Long Taq (Roche Applied Sciences, http://www.roche-applied-science.com) in 30 cycles of 94 8C for 30 s, 55 8C for 30 s, and extensions at 68 8C for 1 min using the following primers on plasmids encoding portions of the icSARS-CoV genome: for the mutation at nucleotide position 10384, primer pairs 59-10124 (59-CATGT CATTT GCACA GCAG) and 39-10364C (59-ATTAG GTCTC ATGGC ACAC) and 59-10384T.A (59-AGACC TAATT ATACC ATTAA AG) and 39-11091C (59-CAAGC ACAAG AATGC GTGC) were used. A second PCR amplification using primers 59-10124 and 39-11091C produced a PCR product that was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (BglII, Mfe1) and ligated into the icSARS-CoV cDNA plasmid. Similarly, the 10793 mutation was constructed using primer pairs 59-10124 and 39-10770C (59-CTTTC AAAGC AGCAC ACATA TC) and 59-10793A.C (59-GAAAG CGCTG CTGCA GAATG) and 39-11091C, followed by amplification with primers 59-10124 and 39-11091C.

The 22797 mutation was constructed using primer pairs 59 #38 (59-AGAGG AACTG CTGTA ATGTC TC) and 39 SMAS MuS(\u00c0) (59-NNNCG TCTCT ATGAT TACCA GTTGA AGTAG CATC) and 59 SMAS SMuS(\u00fe) (59-NNNCG TCTCA TCATAA TTATA AATAT AGGTA TCTTA GACAT GG) and 39 SARS E 4592(\u00c0) (59-CTAGC ACAAA TGCCA GCTCC). The two resulting amplicons were joined following digestion (with BsmBI) and purification and ligation. The full-length product was digested and inserted into an icSARS-CoV cDNA utilizing restriction endonuclease sites AgeI and SalI. The 26428 mutation was constructed using primer sets 59 #44 (59-TGATCCTCTGCAACCTGAGC) and 39 SMAS MuM(\u00c0) (59-NNNCGTCTCACGGTAATAGTACCGTTGTCTGC) and 59 SMAS MuM(\u00fe) (59-NNNCGTCTCTACCGTTGAGAAGCTTAAACAACTCC) and 39 SARS X5(\u00c0) (59-NNNNNTTAATTAATTAATTTGTTCGTT-TATTTAAAACAACA). Resulting amplicons were ligated following digestion with BsmBI. The mutation-containing product was digested and inserted into an icSARS-CoV cDNA at SwaI and NdeI restriction sites. In all cases, the final plasmids and the mutations in the plaquepurified viruses were verified by RT-PCR and sequencing.",
