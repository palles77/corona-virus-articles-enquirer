            "text": "BACKGROUND: Respiratory viral infections can increase the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction after lung transplantation, but the mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we determined whether symptomatic respiratory viral infections after lung transplantation induce circulating exosomes that contain lung-associated self-antigens and assessed whether these exosomes activate immune responses to self-antigens. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from lung transplant recipients with symptomatic lower-and upper-tract respiratory viral infections and from non-symptomatic stable recipients. Exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation; purity was determined using sucrose cushion; and presence of lung self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens for rhinovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were determined using immunoblot. Mice were immunized with circulating exosomes from each group and resulting differential immune responses and lung histology were analyzed. RESULTS: Exosomes containing self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens were detected at significantly higher levels (p < 0.05) in serum of recipients with symptomatic respiratory viral infections (n = 35) as compared with stable controls (n = 32). Mice immunized with exosomes from recipients with respiratory viral infections developed immune responses to self-antigens, fibrosis, small airway occlusion, and significant cellular infiltration; mice immunized with exosomes from controls did not (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating exosomes isolated from lung transplant recipients diagnosed with respiratory viral infections contained lung self-antigens, viral antigens, and 20S proteasome and elicited immune responses to lung self-antigens that resulted in development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction in immunized mice.",

            "text": "exosomes; graft rejection; respiratory viral infection; lung transplantation; chronic rejection; antigens; antibodies Lung allograft failure from chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the leading cause of death beyond the first year after lung transplant (LTx). Roughly 70% of LTx recipients (LTxRs) with CLAD have bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) 1 and include both obstructive and restrictive phenotypes. 2 The term restrictive allograft syndrome was introduced by Sato et al 3 and was diagnosed in 30% of bilateral LTx patients with CLAD. The diagnosis was based on finding a restrictive ventilatory defect and had radiographic findings of interstitial opacities with 41% having upper zone involvement. Previously reported risk factors for CLAD include acute rejection, 4\u22126 cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis, 7 antibodies (Abs) to donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA), 8, 9 Abs to non-HLA lung-associated self-antigens (SAgs), 10\u221212 primary graft dysfunction, 13 and respiratory viral infections (RVIs). 14\u221219 The immunologic mechanisms that underlie the development of CLAD remain unknown, and therapy for established CLAD is generally ineffective. RVI after LTx has been associated with increased risk of CLAD. 15, 17, 18 Fisher et al 17 conducted a large retrospective study that used systematic definitions, adjudicated assignment of CLAD by blinded reviewers, and highly sensitive and specific molecular diagnosis of RVI and found a strong and independent association between symptomatic RVI and CLAD 17 ; other studies have also found an association between RVI and CLAD. 15,18\u221220 Potential mechanisms for RVI-induced CLAD pathogenesis were not assessed. We recently demonstrated that LTxRs with acute and chronic rejection have circulating exosomes that contain donor-mismatched HLA, lung SAgs, and immunoregulatory microRNA; exosomes from stable LTxRs do not have these same features. 21 A study by Dieud e et al 22 demonstrated that the presence of 20S proteasome in exosomes increases their immunogenicity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that RVI-induced allograft injury may induce circulating exosomes that contain donor HLA, SAgs, and viral antigens, which may activate donor-specific immune responses and increase the risk of CLAD.",

Patients were eligible for the study if they had undergone LTx at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, between 2011 and 2015, or at Norton Thoracic Institute, St. Joseph's Hospital, Phoenix, Arizona between 2016 and 2018, and had stored serum available. Baseline patient demographics, transplant details, and laboratory data were collected from patient charts. All patients were followed up for at least 6 years, with clinical and laboratory information collected. The end-point of BOS was diagnosed according to the guidelines from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. 23 RVI testing was performed when indicated for compatible signs and symptoms. Only patients with symptomatic RVI were included. RVI was diagnosed using the BioFire FilmArray PCR (BioM erieux, Marcy-l' Etoile, France), which detects 17 types of respiratory viruses, including adenovirus, coronavirus (types HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43), human Metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza (A, A/H1, A/H3, A/H1-2009, B), parainfluenza 1-4, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Both upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) and lower (bronchoalveolar wash or lavage) specimens were included. Patients were considered to have a lower-tract infection if they had a positive lower-tract specimen or upper respiratory specimen along with either lower respiratory symptoms (cough, wheezing) or decline in forced expiratory volume. LTxRs in the control group had no evidence of symptomatic RVI during the period of serum collection. Post-transplant immunosuppression comprised a triple immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus or cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine, and prednisone. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Washington University and St. Joseph's Hospital. All laboratory analyses were performed by personnel blinded to clinical outcomes, and all clinical end-points were adjudicated by personnel who were blinded to laboratory results.",

They not only found high rates of RVI but also demonstrated an independent association between RVI and CLAD 17 and suggested further study to characterize the viral determinants and to define the mechanisms by which RVI increases the risk for CLAD. RVI after LTx has been shown to dysregulate the regulatory T cells, indicating that RVI can lead to dysregulation of tolerance to SAgs, leading to induction of immune responses to SAgs and increasing the risk of CLAD. 14 Studies by our group and others showed that Abs to lung SAgs have been shown to develop and correlate with development of CLAD in LTxRs. 11, 12, 29 Pre-existing Abs to SAgs have also been reported to increase the incidence of primary graft dysfunction, to induce proinflammatory cytokines, and to increase development of donor-specific antibodies and CLAD after LTx. 29 We recently demonstrated that LTxRs diagnosed with acute and chronic rejection have circulating exosomes that express mismatched donor HLA and SAgs. We proposed that the exosomes originating from transplanted lungs may contribute to the immune pathogenesis of CLAD after LTx. 21 Based on these findings, we postulated that symptomatic RVI may induce exosomes containing SAgs from the transplanted organ, and that persistence of circulating exosomes with SAgs can lead to immune responses resulting in increased risk of CLAD.",

In this study, we selected patients diagnosed with RSV, coronavirus, and rhinovirus and demonstrated that exosomes isolated from these patients contained specific viral antigens along with SAgs. Therefore, exosomes are induced following viral infection that contain viral antigens and SAgs. Preliminary analysis of serial circulating exosomes containing viral antigens demonstrated that in 3 of 5 LTxRs, there was a transient presence of circulating exosomes. In contrast, 2 of 5 LTxRs with RVI had persistence of circulating exosomes with lung SAgs and viral antigens. This interesting finding needs to be confirmed to determine the role of circulating exosomes in inducing immune responses leading to CLAD. It is likely that the exosomes with viral antigenic epitopes can activate cross-reactive T cells, which can play a role in the pathogenesis of CLAD after LTx. 33, 34 We demonstrated that exosomes isolated from symptomatic patients with RVI contained increased SAgs and viral antigens; if further studies identify a useful threshold Exosomes from LTxRs with RVI induce a humoral immune response to lung SAgs.

            "text": "Our study is limited in that exosomes isolated from patients diagnosed with RVI were not analyzed in mice models of obliterative airway diseases following lung transplantation. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that exosomes from patients with RVI can increase the incidence of CLAD development. The sample size used in the mouse model was small and we used pooled exosomes for immunization. Therefore, the role of individual viruses in inducing exosomes that are immunogenic cannot be concluded from the studies presented. We have shown that serum samples collected from LTxRs with RVI had increased Abs to lung SAgs and exosomes containing lung SAgs and viral antigens compared with stable LTxRs. However, viral RNA in the exosomes and its role in immune activation needs to be determined in future studies. Another limitation is that the role of individual RVI viruses to induce exosomes that can increase the risk for CLAD were not determined because of the limited availability of retrospectively collected samples. Our study, however, demonstrated that exosomes derived from LTxRs with RVIinduced interstitial fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration by adoptive transfer of exosomes (gain of function) in a mice model, which suggests that RVI exosomes are sufficient to induce lesions in mice with similarities to the pathology seen in restrictive allograft syndrome in human LTxRs.",

Based on these, we proposed that RVI-induced exosomes containing lung SAgs and viral antigens can augment humoral and cellular immune responses to lung SAgs and alloantigens, increasing the risk of CLAD. These results strongly suggest a biologically plausible mechanistic link between RVI induction and release of circulating exosomes with SAgs and the development of CLAD, which should be assessed in a large prospective cohort.",
