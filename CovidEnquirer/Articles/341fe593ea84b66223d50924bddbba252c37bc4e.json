It 3 has become an epidemic with more than 71,000 confirmed infections and 4 1,775 reported deaths worldwide as on February 17 2020. The COVID-19 5 is caused by a new corona viruses that is genetically similar to the viruses 6 causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respi-7 ratory syndrome (MERS). Despite a relatively lower fatality rate comparing 8 to SARS and MERS, the COVID-19 spreads faster and infects much more 9 people than the SARS-03 outbreak. 10 The city of Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak, has been locked up to 11 curtail population movement since January 23 in an effort to stop the spread 12 of the epidemic, followed by more than 50 prefecture level cities (as on 8th 13 of February) and countless number of towns and villages in China. A high 14 percentage of the population are exercising self-isolation in their homes. The 15 spring festival holiday period had been extended with all schools and uni-16 versities closed and all students staying where they are indefinitely. The 17 country is virtually in a stand-still, and the economy and people's livelihood 18 have been severely affected by the epidemic. 19 There is an urgent need to assess the speed of the disease transmission 20 and to check if the existing containment measures have successfully slowed 21 down the spread of the disease or not. The Susceptible-Infected-Removal 22 (SIR) model [2] and its generalizations, for instance the SEIR model [3] with 23 four or more compartments are commonly used to model the dynamics of 24",
