Coronavirus structural envelope (E) protein possesses specific motifs involved in proteinprotein interaction or in homo-oligomeric ion channel formation, which are known to play various roles including in virion morphology/assembly and in cell response to infection and/or virulence. Making use of recombinant viruses either devoid of the E protein or harboring mutations either in putative transmembrane domain or PDZ-binding motif, we demonstrated that a fully functional HCoV-OC43 E protein is first needed for optimal production of recombinant infectious viruses. Furthermore, HCoV-OC43 infection of human epithelial and neuronal cell lines, of mixed murine primary cultures from the central nervous system and of mouse central nervous system showed that the E protein is critical for efficient and optimal virus replication and propagation, and thereby for neurovirulence.",

Coronaviruses also represent a significant public health concern due to the recent zoonotically emerged, highly pathogenic species, SARS corovonavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003 Ksiazek et al., ) in 2002 Ksiazek et al., -2003 Ksiazek et al., and, since 2012 , Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Zaki et al., 2012) , localized to the Arabian Peninsula, but with sporadic travel-related outbreaks worldwide.

            "text": "Coronaviruses represent the largest known enveloped RNA (single-stranded positive sense) viruses with a genome of approximately 30 kb (de Groot et al., 2012) . The viral envelope is composed of four or five proteins, the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE), the latter in some \u03b2 coronaviruses genus, such as HCoV-OC43. Coronavirus E proteins are 74-109 amino acids in length, 84 amino acids for HCoV-OC43, and share only a small amount of sequence identity between coronavirus species. However, its secondary structure, composed of a short N-terminal domain followed by a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD) and hydrophilic cytoplasmic tail, remains overall conserved and is suggested to be more important than sequence for function (Kuo et al., 2007; Torres et al., 2005) . The importance of the presence of the E protein in the viral envelope is emphasized by the fact that there are only about twenty E molecules incorporated within the virion structure (Godet et al., 1992; Liu and Inglis, 1991; Yu et al., 1994) and deletion of the protein can either completely prevent the production of detectable infectious virions (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013; Curtis et al., 2002; Ortego et al., 2007 Ortego et al., , 2002 or significantly reduce infectious virus titers (DeDiego et al., 2008 (DeDiego et al., , 2007 Kuo et al., 2007; Kuo and Masters, 2003) . The majority of the coronavirus E protein in the infected cell is localized within the secretory pathway between the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi and intermediate compartment between them (ERGIC) (Cohen et al., 2011; Nieto-Torres et al., 2011; Venkatagopalan et al., 2015) . It is in this intracellular region that additional functions mediated by various domains of the coronavirus E proteins are proposed to occur. Homo-pentameric oligomerization of the E protein TMD in membranes to form ion channels, called viroporins, has been predicted for several coronaviruses (Torres et al., 2005) and extensively studied for species such as SARS-CoV (Nieto- Pervushin et al., 2009) or avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Ruch and Machamer, 2012; Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015) . Another domain found at the extreme C-terminal end of the E protein, a PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM), has also been predicted for several coronavirus species . This protein-protein interaction motif capable of interrupting normal cellular functions, has been demonstrated in other viruses to play important roles in replication, dissemination in the host and pathogenesis (Javier and Rice, 2011) . The multiple properties of coronavirus E proteins have not yet been fully investigated or explained, and can at times differ between coronavirus species. The multifunctionality of the E protein could be explained by the presence of two distinct pools (monomeric versus homo-oligomeric states) present in the infected cell (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015) . Furthermore, the different motifs found within the protein could mediate different specific functions. The coronavirus E protein was also recently recognized as an important virulence factor for the SARS-CoV , where deletion of the whole or part of the protein led to an attenuated pathology in mouse lungs (DeDiego et al., 2008 (DeDiego et al., , 2007 , attenuation which was later linked to the E protein TMD and PBM .",

Throughout the amplification process we were consistently unable to detect infectious viral particles issuing from viral stocks of rOC/E-Stop. Amplifications of initially complemented viral stocks of rOC/E-Stop led to detectable titers which decreased over the course of each subsequent amplification compared to rOC/ATCC. Sequencing of viral RNA confirmed that the E gene in the viral rOC/E-Stop stocks contained the introduced stop codon at each amplification step (data not shown).

Initially complemented rOC/E-Stop, previously recovered from transfection on BHK-21 cells (P0), was used for infection and infectious viral titers determined over a period of 72 h post-infection (hpi). This revealed an important decrease of infectious virus production for human cells ( Fig. 2A) , which was exacerbated in primary murine cells, where virus titers were under the limit of detection (Fig. 2B ). However, in these primary cultures, low levels of infected cells were visualized by immunofluorescence (IFA) where we detect the viral S protein, suggesting that infection was possible even for the complemented rOC/E-Stop virus but that production of new infectious progeny and eventual propagation were severely inhibited compared to wild type virus (Fig. 2C ).",

However, in the cell-associated fractions, the amount of recovered infectious virus particles was almost identical to those of the reference virus ( Fig. 3B and C, right panels), suggesting a possible defect in virus release. In order to ascertain this potential defect, human LA-N-5 cells were infected with either rOC/ATCC or rOC/ E-TM Q17A , and both infectious titer and viral RNA copies (associated to total viral particles) in the cell-free fraction were quantified at 16 h post-infection (Fig. 3D ). Only the infectious titer was quantified in the cell-associated fraction as (with our system of q-RT-PCR), we are not able to differentiate between viral genomic and subgenomic RNA and between viral RNA that would be inserted in virion or free in the infected cell. Similar levels of viral infectious particles were measured in the cell-associated fractions for both viruses at 16hpi indicating that the cells have been infected with the same efficiency and that the viral replication early steps are not affected by the alteration of the TMD. However infectious viral titer in the supernatant (cell-free fraction) of cells infected with rOC/E-TM Q17A was significantly reduced compared to cells infected with rOC/ATCC, although both viruses produced similar amount of total viral particles. These findings are supported by immunofluorescence assay showing a delay in propagation of rOC/E-TM Q17A over 72 hpi compared to reference virus (Fig. 3E , Figure S1A and B).",

To this end, we modified our cDNA infectious clone to change the two key amino acids of the putative PBM motif, at the \u22120 and \u22122 positions from the C-terminal end respectively, into inert alanines, and thereby abrogated putative motif recognition by potential interaction partner(s).

In LA-N-5 cells, after 18 hpi, the titers of rOC/E-PBM D82A-V84A were significantly decreased in the cell-free and cell-associated virus fraction compared to single PBM mutants or reference viruses and total infectious virus titers of the double mutant was severely altered over 72 h (Fig. 4B ). This trend was exacerbated in primary mixed murine CNS cultures, which showed no detection of infectious rOC/E-PBM D82A-V84A compared to single mutant PBM and reference viruses (Fig. 4C ). As no differences were observed between both single PBM mutant (rOC/E-PBM D82A and rOC/E-PBM V84A ) and reference virus, we continued the characterization of the potential PBM only with the double mutant virus (rOC/E-PBM D82A-V84A ). Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that cells could be infected by all viruses but we detected a significant difference in propagation for both LA-N-5 cells (Fig. 4D , Figure S2A ) and primary mixed murine CNS cultures ( Figure S2B) , showing a significantly reduced propagation for the double PBM mutant rOC/E-PBM D82A-V84A .",

Using a RT-qPCR approach, the quantity of total viral particles in stocks of rOC/ ATCC, rOC/E stop , rOC/E-TM Q17A or rOC/E-PBM D82A-V84A were evaluated and compared to the infectious titer of the corresponding viruses (Fig. 5A ). Whereas the reference virus possesses a ratio of infectious virion to total viral particles of approximately 1:100, the rOC/ E stop mutant has a ratio of 1:56 000 correlating with the default in infectious virion production previously observed. Surprisingly, the quantity of total viral particles (evaluated as total RNA copy number by RT-qPCR) was close to the reference virus. The same defect was observed for rOC/E-TM Q17A but to a lesser extent with a ratio of 1:1065, but it was absent for the rOC/E-PBM D82A-V84A mutant. Indeed, even though this latter mutant produces less virions compared to the reference virus, a very high proportion of them are infectious, as the ratio of infectious over total particles is about 1:2 (Fig. 5A ). These observations of modified ratio were confirmed by immunofluorescence comparing the percentage of infected cells when the quantity of virus used for the infection of LA-N-5 cells was normalized either to the number of infectious virions or to the number of total viral particles (Fig. 5B ). All these findings demonstrate that the HCoV-OC43 E protein is critical for efficient replication in epithelial and neuronal cells, and that its functional domains play important and potentially distinct roles during the production of new infectious virions.",

HCoV-OC43 E protein and its TMD and PBM are essential for efficient replication in the murine CNS As HCoV-OC43 E protein and its functional domains modulate viral replication and propagation in human and murine neuronal cultures (Figs. 3, and 4) , we examined if the differences in neurovirulence observed ( Fig. 6 ) were also to be associated with defective infectious virus productions and propagation in the CNS. Infection of 22-day-old C57Bl/ 6 mice with reference and E protein mutants revealed that the infectious titer in the brain (Fig. 7A ) and the spinal cord ( Fig. 7B ) was significantly reduced for the TMD mutant. This altered replication in the brain correlates with an extremely weak production in the spinal cord, where infectious virions were detected in only one mouse at 5 dpi. Production of infectious particles was under the limit of detection in mice infected with the PBM mutant, correlating with the total absence of neurovirulence (Fig. 6) . However, the PBM mutant RNA was detected in the brain at 5 and 9 dpi, although at a lower level than the reference virus or the TMD mutant (Fig. 7C) , indicating that this virus was capable of replicating at a low level in the brain. Similar observations were obtained following mouse infection with rOC/E stop (Fig. S3D ). Viral RNA of each mutant was extracted at 5 and 9 dpi and sequenced for the E and M gene. No reversion in the targeted genes were observed (data not shown), indicating that the inserted mutations are stable during replication in the murine brain for at least 9 days. It is interesting to note than when infected with a higher viral dose (10 2.5 TCID 50 /10 \u00b5L vs 10 1.5 TCID 50 /10 \u00b5L), infectious virions of the PBM mutant could be detected in low amount in the brain of mice ( Figure S4A ). Our system only allows to detect infectious titer over 10 2.5 . Thus, the apparent (but very low) increase of infectious virus production observed at 10-11 days post-infection may be explained by the fact that the PBM mutant replicates at very low level between 3 and 11 days pi and that, by doing this, this mutant could be able to avoid detection by the immune system and delay its clearance from the CNS. Viral RNA was also detected in both the brain and spinal cord ( Figure S4B and C). Sequencing of the E and M genes again revealed the absence of reversion, again suggesting that the absence of detectable infectious virion production previously observed (Fig. 7) was probably due to the low infectious dose. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a fully competent E protein (with both functional TMD and PBM) is essential for HCoV-OC43 neurovirulence in association with efficient replication in the CNS, correlating with the early observations in neuronal cells (Figs. 2-4) .",

The putative TMD decreases HCoV-OC43 propagation in the murine brain When infection was performed at a 10 1.5 TCID 50 /10 \u00b5L dose, only the E protein TMD mutant produced detectable virions in the brain (infectious virus is under the limit of detection for PBM mutant). However, this production was significantly lowered compared to reference virus. Therefore, based on data obtained in neuronal cultures (Figs. 2-4), we investigated if the TMD mutation also induced a defect in propagation within the brain. Brains of mice infected intracerebrally with rOC/ATCC or rOC/E-TM Q17A were harvested at 3 and 7 dpi, and viral spreading was observed by immunofluorescence. Whereas the reference virus had already infected the hippocampus at 3 days postinfection (with positive cells around the lateral ventricle and in the hypothalamus), and then continued to spread until the rest of the brain was infected at 7 dpi ( Fig. 8 left panels) , the rOC/E-TM Q17A presented an important delay in spreading as only a few number of infected cells were visible at 3 dpi except for a small focus of infection around the hippocampus and the lateral ventricle. Spreading then occurred to the same brain regions compared to reference virus but to a much lower extent (Fig. 8 right panels) . This suggests that although the TMD mutant seems to follow the same spreading path in the murine brain, its spreading is greatly delayed and underlines the fact that HCoV-OC43 E protein TMD is important for efficient propagation in the murine brain.",

            "text": "Deletion of the E protein leads to varying degrees of defects for coronaviruses. Indeed, whereas murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV are attenuated, showing a reduced ability to produce infectious virus without E protein, in a cell-type specific manner (DeDiego et al., 2008 (DeDiego et al., , 2007 Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2015; Kuo and Masters, 2003) , transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Ortego et al., 2002) and MERS-CoV (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013) are replication competent, but completely propagation defective, with no detectable infectious virus production when the E protein is deleted. Similarly, we were able to rescue infectious rOC/E stop production by providing wild-type E protein in trans, as the recovery of initially complemented rOC/E stop through complementation, and amplification on epithelial cells yielded detectable infectious virus (Fig. 1) . As suggested for MERS-CoV (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013) , the apparent low titer detected after the first passage on HRT-18 cells (especially at P1), could be due to a transfer of detached cells transfected with the initially complemented pBAC-OC43-E-Stop. Furthermore, the production of infectious particles (for initially complemented mutant lacking the E protein) was low and decreased with J.K. Stodola et al. Virology 515 (2018) 134-149 subsequent amplification attempts. On the other hand, these results also suggest that production of infectious virions without E protein is possible but with severely affected efficiency, underlining the requirement of a fully functional E protein. Coronavirus E protein has been suggested to allow correct virion formation in part by inhibiting M protein aggregation (Kuo et al., 2007) , or by inducing scission events at the ERGIC (Fischer et al., 1998) . Our data indicate that while reducing dramatically the quantity of infectious viral particles formed, the complete abrogation of HCoV-OC43 E protein did not significantly alter the quantity of total viral particles produced compared to the reference virus (Fig. 5) , suggesting that the protein is important for efficient virion maturation that lead to good infectivity. This concept is emphasized by the appearance of recombinant HCoV-OC43 E protein revertants at a very low passage number (P2 or P3) on HRT-18 cells. Indeed, the appearance of revertants with different E sequences after only a few rounds of amplification on HRT-18 cells indicates that low level of viral particles must have been produced earlier during the process as we already observed previously for HEdeleted recombinant HCoV-OC43 (Desforges et al., 2013) . We observed strong selective pressure at the position where we introduced a stop codon where nucleotide changes led to reversion to reference E sequence or to another amino acid residue (tryptophan or leucine). It was previously described that SARS-CoV and MHV (Kuo and Masters, 2010 ) E protein deletion mutants underwent compensatory mutations after a few passages in culture to utilize a partially duplicated version of the adjacent M protein to recover partial virus production. A second type of reversion was observed for SARS-CoV E protein deletion mutant after an intranasal infection of susceptible mice as the small transmembrane ion channel forming 8a was modified to incorporate a potential PBM associated with increased infectious virus production compared to E protein deletion mutant (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2015) . Our results support the hypothesis Fig. 6 . A fully functional HCoV-OC43 E protein is associated with optimal neuroinvasion and increases neurovirulence. (A) 7-day-old C57Bl/6 mice received 10 3 TCID 50 /20 \u00b5L of rOC/ ATCC, rOC/E-TM Q17A or rOC/E-PBM D82A-V84A by the IN route. Neuroinvasion was detected and quantified by RT-qPCR on brain RNA at 5 days post-infection, each point represents a single mouse. (B) Twenty-two-day-old C57Bl/6 mice received 10 2.5 TCID 50 /10 \u00b5L of rOC/ATCC, rOC/E-TM Q17A or rOC/E-PBM D82A-V84A by the IC route and were observed for survival over 21 days following the injection. (C) Infected mice were weighted every 2 days for a period of 21 days following infection. The weight gain is shown as percentage of d0 set at 100%.

The TMD of several coronavirus E proteins (including HCoV-OC43) was predicted (Torres et al., 2005) and Fig. 7 . The E protein TM and PBM domain are essential for optimal replication in the murine brain and spinal cord. Infectious viral particles were quantified in (A) the brains and (B) the spinal cord of 22-day-old C57Bl/6 mice infected by the IC route with 10 1.5 TCID 50 /10 \u00b5L rOC/ATCC, rOC/E-TM-Q17A or rOC/E-PBM-82-84 over a period of 15 days. (C) Viral RNA was detected and quantified by RT-qPCR in the brain of infected mice at 5 and 9 days post-infection. LOD, limit of detection. Representative of three different experiments. Fig. 8 . HCoV-OC43 E protein putative TM domain is required for efficient spreading in mouse CNS. Viral spreading in mice brain was examined by immunofluorescence at 3 and 7 days post-infection.

Virology 515 (2018) 134-149 shown to form ion channels permeable to small cations in artificial membranes for species such as IBV, MHV, HCoV-229E (Wilson et al., 2006) , MERS-CoV (Surya et al., 2015) and SARS-CoV (Wilson et al., 2004) . Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the IBV E protein can exist in a penta-oligomeric state (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015) , and that for MERS-CoV (Surya et al., 2015) and SARS-CoV (Pervushin et al., 2009; Torres et al., 2006; Verdi\u00e1-B\u00e1guena et al., 2013 , it forms pentameric channels in lipid membranes. Chemical inhibition of ion channel activity (Wilson et al., 2006) , destruction of the integrity of (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2014; Regla-Nava et al., 2015; Ye and Hogue, 2007) or replacement of the TMD with those of other viral species (Ruch and Machamer, 2011) all led to reduced viral titers for other coronaviruses species. The E protein of coronaviruses is largely localized within the secretory pathway (Cohen et al., 2011; Nieto-Torres et al., 2011; Venkatagopalan et al., 2015) where it has recently been described for IBV to exist in two different pools; one of monomeric E proteins that disrupt the secretory pathway and a second pool in an oligomeric state, likely serving to facilitate the assembly of progeny virions (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015) . The transient delay in infectious virus release observed for the TMD mutant compared to the reference virus (Fig. 3) suggests a defect in virus release that could be the result of damaged infectious particles as it was observed for IBV, for which a TMD mutant of the E protein induces a similar defect associated with increased quantity of non-infectious viral particles released possessing a cleaved S protein near the virion surface (Ruch and Machamer, 2011) . Considering the higher proportion of non-infectious virions released by cells infected with the TMD mutant compared to cells infected with the reference virus (Figs. 3D and 5A), a similar process consisting in an alteration of infectious virions in the secretory pathway may also be involved here, suggesting an important role for TMD within the cellular secretory pathway. Furthermore, mutation at homologous position T16 of IBV did not have an effect on VLP formation but rather was required for secretory pathway disruption (Ruch and Machamer, 2012; Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015) . These results suggest that mutation Q17A (homologous to IBV T16A) in the HCoV-OC43 E protein putative TMD plays a role in modulating infectious virus release from infected cells.",

            "text": "A four-amino acid C-terminal PBM protein-protein interaction motif has been predicted for HCoV-OC43 . Through the replacement of the key amino acids of this motif by alanines, we demonstrated its importance in infectious virion production in the epithelial and neuronal cells tested (Fig. 4) . Defective propagation without an effect on the ability to infect cells was observed with the recombinant virus with an abrogated putative PBM. Deletion of the PBM in SARS-CoV E protein led to slight decreases in viral titers in some cell types while in others viral titers remained unaffected . Our data on HCoV-OC43 reveal significant infectious virus production defects in an epithelial cell line which was further accentuated in neurons, but only after infection by the double mutant rOC/E-PBM D82A-V84A , suggesting that HCoV-OC43 replication in cultured cells can tolerate a slight flexibility in the putative PBM sequence. Among coronavirus E proteins, only the SARS-CoV E protein has been shown to per se possess such a functional motif, which interacts with PALS1 to disturb secretory pathway membranes to alter tight junction formation (Teoh et al., 2010) and syntenin to play a role in the exacerbated inflammatory response typical of infection via p38 MAPK activation . For SARS-CoV E protein, the PBM is suggested to be important in two independent functions: virus stability and virulence/pathogenesis rather than virus production Regla-Nava et al., 2015) . Given that the functions of PBM is dependent on their sequence and surrounding sequence context (Ye and Zhang, 2013) , further study of the HCoV-OC43 E protein neuronal interactome is warranted and could provide new insights on the precise function of the protein in infected cells. Prevention of a functional interaction between HCoV-OC43 E protein PBM and its PDZ domain-containing ligand could conceivably function in the same vein as seen in case of neurotropic encephalitic rabies virus, for which differences in disease phenotype, rapid versus attenuated spread of virus infection, was attributed to differences in PBM sequences on the C-terminal of the rabies envelope glycoprotein G leading to different cellular interaction partners to mediate either neuronal cell survival or death (Pr\u00e9haud et al., 2010) . Surprisingly, the PBM mutant forms less total viral particles but almost all of them are infectious. As protein-protein interaction motifs, viral PBM are involved in a variety of processes, including viral particle assembly and maturation (Javier and Rice, 2011) . Abrogation of the E PBM, could prevent critical cellular and/or viral interaction necessary for the rapid and efficient formation and maturation of viral particles, making propagation highly inefficient.",

HCoV-OC43 E protein seems to differ from its SARS-CoV homolog as viral RNA is present in the brain of all mice intranasally infected with either the reference virus, the TMD mutant or the PBM mutant (Fig. 6-A) , indicating that the fully functional protein is not essential for neuroinvasion. On the other hand, the amount of viral RNA was significantly lower in the brain of E mutantinfected mice. Although we cannot rule out that these data represent a difference in replication and propagation once the virus is already in the brain, optimal HCoV-OC43 neuroinvasion may necessitate a fully functional E protein. The SARS-CoV E protein was recently described as an important virulence factor during infection of the lungs, being in part responsible for the immune response exacerbation , the lung epithelium destruction (Teoh et al., 2010) , and edema accumulation in the lungs . We demonstrate here that HCoV-OC43 E protein deletion as well as abrogation of the putative PBM prevented neurological symptoms following CNS infection, correlating with replication and propagation observations in epithelial and neuronal cells (Fig. 6) . Disappearance of respiratory tract disease was observed for SARS-CoV in which E PBM was abrogated, preventing interaction of the viral protein with the PDZcontaining protein syntenin Regla-Nava et al., 2015) . The absence of neurological symptoms following infection by either rOC/E stop or rOC/E-PBM D82A-V84A could potentially be linked to glutamate excitotoxicity that we have previously observed in mice (Brison et al., 2011) , possibly by interfering with PDZ-domain containing proteins found in neuronal cells (Feng and Zhang, 2009 ). We also demonstrate that HCoV-OC43 putative TMD plays a role in the neuropathogenesis following the CNS infection, albeit to a lesser extent than its PBM. Indeed, infected mice showed some neurological symptoms, even if their severity and frequency were lower than for the reference virus. This attenuated phenotype was also associated with reduced viral particles production and propagation in the CNS. Homologous mutation at the position 15 of SARS-CoV E protein also led to an attenuated pathology, although infectious viral particle production was not significantly affected compared to wild-type virus . Taken together, these results demonstrate that HCoV-OC43 E protein is a virulence factor, with TMD and PBM being important determinants in that matter.",

            "text": "In summary, the current study demonstrates the critical importance of a fully functional HCoV-OC43 E protein in infectious virus production and efficient spread in both epithelial and neuronal cells. Modifications to key amino acids in putative functionally important domains modulated infectious virion production and delayed virus spread in human and murine neuronal cells and within mouse CNS. This points towards the presence of a true TMD, which has a role in the secretory pathway, as seen for other coronaviruses and that the HCoV-OC43 E protein putative C-terminal PBM plays a significant role in infectious virion production as well as efficient virus spread. In addition, this study establishes a clear link between both putative functional domains of HCoV-OC43 E protein and CNS pathogenesis. Functional viroporins and viral PBM are associated with viral pathogenesis for a growing number of viruses and their studies to better understand virus-host interaction represent an emerging field (Javier and Rice, 2011; Nieva et al., 2012; Scott and Griffin, 2015) . Considering that the HCoV-OC43 E protein seems to possess both functions and that they seem to be important for the induction of disease, future studies regarding their functionality and underlying mechanisms resulting in HCoV-OC43 neuropathogenesis previously described (Brison et al., 2011; Jacomy et al., 2006; Le Coupanec et al., 2015) are warranted and necessary as they will help to identify virus-host interfaces which could represent therapeutic target.",
