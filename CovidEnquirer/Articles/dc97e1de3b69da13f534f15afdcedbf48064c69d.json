Wipe mucus, blood, or vomitus from the mouth. In unconscious animals, maintain head and neck stability. 2. Look for signs of breathing. If there is no evidence of breathing or the gum color is blue, begin mouth-to-nose breathing. Encircle the muzzle area with your hands to pinch down on the gums, and blow into the nose 15 to 20 times per minute. 3. Is there evidence of cardiac function? Check for a palpable pulse on the hind legs or for an apex beat over the sternum. If no signs of cardiac function are found, begin external cardiac compressions at 80 to 120 times per minute. 4. Is there any hemorrhage? Use a clean cloth, towel, paper towel, or disposable diaper or feminine hygiene product to cover the wound. Apply firm pressure to slow hemorrhage and prevent further blood loss. Do not use a tourniquet, because this can cause further damage. Apply pressure, and as blood seeps through the first layer of bandage material, place a second layer over the top. 5. Cover any external wounds. Use a clean bandage material soaked in warm water, and transport the animal to the nearest veterinary emergency facility. Address penetrating wounds to the abdomen and thorax immediately. 6. Are there any obvious fractures present? Immobilize fractures with homemade splints made of newspaper, broom handles, or sticks. Muzzle the awake animal before attempting to place any splints. If a splint cannot be attached safely, place the animal on a towel or blanket and transport the animal to the nearest veterinary emergency facility.",

For evaluation of the thorax, the patient is positioned in lateral recumbency and the ultrasound probe is directed in a horizontal plane at the dorsal aspect of the ninth intercostal space, in the transverse and longitudinal planes caudal to the point of the elbow, over the heart to evaluate for pericardial and pleural effusion.

Aseptically scrub the clipped area with antimicrobial scrub solution. 3. Wearing gloves, insert a 22-or 20-gauge needle or over-the-needle catheter in four quadrants: cranial and to the right, cranial and to the left, caudal and to the right, and caudal and to the left of the umbilicus. As you insert the needle or catheter, gently twist the needle to push any abdominal organs away from the tip of the needle. Local anesthesia typically is not required for this procedure, although a light sedative or analgesic may be necessary if severe abdominal pain is present. In some cases, fluid will flow freely from one or more of the needles. If not, gently aspirate with a 3-to 6-mL syringe or aspirate with the patient in a standing position. Avoid changing positions with needles in place because iatrogenic puncture of intraabdominal organs may occur. 4. Save any fluid collected in sterile red-and lavender-topped tubes for cytologic and biochemical analyses and bacterial culture. Monitor hemorrhagic fluid carefully for the presence of clots. Normally, hemorrhagic effusions rapidly become defibrinated and do not clot. Clot formation can occur in the presence of ongoing active hemorrhage or may be caused by the iatrogenic puncture of organs such as the spleen or liver. If abdominal paracentesis is negative, DPL can be performed. Although peritoneal dialysis kits are commercially available, they are fairly expensive and often impractical for the general practitioner.",

Place the intermediate and tertiary layers loosely around the limb, starting distally and working proximally, with some overlap with each consecutive layer. This method prevents excessive pressure and potential impairment of venous drainage. Leave the toenails of the third and fourth digits exposed, whenever possible, to allow daily examination of the bandage to determine whether the bandage is impairing venous drainage. If the bandage is too tight and constricting or impeding vascular flow, the toes will become swollen and spread apart. When placed and maintained properly (e.g., the bandage does not get wet), there usually are relatively few complications observed with this type of bandage.",

To create a pressure bandage, place a nonadherent dressing immediately in contact with the wound, followed by a thick layer of absorbent material, topped by a layer of elastic bandage material such as Elastikon or Vetrap. Unlike the bandage for a closed wound, the top tertiary outer layer should be wrapped with some tension and even pressure around the limb, starting from the distal extremity (toes) and working proximally. The pressure bandage serves to control hemorrhage but should not be left on for long periods. Pressure bandages that have been left on for too long can impair nerve function and lead to tissue necrosis and slough. Therefore pressure bandages should be used in the hospital only, so that the patient can be observed closely. If hemorrhage through the bandage occurs, place another bandage over the first until the wound can be repaired definitively.

DEAs 1.1 and 1.2 are the most immunogenic RBC antigens known in canine transfusion medicine. Transfusion of DEA 1.1-or 1.2-positive blood to a DEA 1.1-and 1.2-negative dog can result in immediate hemolysis or a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. In addition, viability of DEA 1.1-and 1.2-positive cells in a DEA 1.1-and 1.2-negative recipient is shortlived, ultimately defeating the long-term goal of increasing oxygen delivery in the recipient. As with dogs, feline blood groups are defined by specific carbohydrate moieties attached to lipids (glycolipids) and proteins (glycoproteins) on the RBC surface. Three blood types (A, B, and AB) have been identified in cats. Type A is the most common blood type in cats. Type B is relatively uncommon and occurs in Abyssinian, Persian, Devon Rex, and British Shorthair cats but can be found in domestic shorthair and longhair cats as well. Type A is completely dominant over type B by simple mendelian genetics. Type AB is a rare blood type that has been identified infrequently in domestic shorthair cats; Birman, Abyssinian, Somali, British Shorthair, and Scottish Fold cats; and Norwegian Forest Cats. Unlike dogs, cats possess naturally occurring antibodies against other feline blood types. The presence of naturally occurring autoantibodies is of paramount importance, necessitating blood typing with or without crossmatch before any feline transfusion, because hemolytic transfusion reactions potentially can be fatal, even with no prior sensitization or blood transfusion. Type B cats possess large quantities of anti-A antibodies, primarily of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) subclass. Type A blood infused into a type B cat will be destroyed within minutes to hours, and as little as 1 mL of incompatible blood can cause a life-threatening reaction. Type A cats typically possess weak anti-B antibodies of IgG and IgM subtypes. Transfusion of type B blood into a type A cat will result in milder clinical signs of reaction and a markedly decreased survival half-life of the infused RBCs to just 2 days. Because type AB cats possess both moieties on the cell surface, they lack naturally occurring alloantibodies; transfusion of type A blood into a type AB cat can be performed safely if a type AB donor is not available. The life span of an RBC from a type-specific transfusion into a cat is approximately 33 days.",

Maintenance of a closed donor colony may be impractical because of the economics of feeding and housing the animals and using cage space that can be used for other patients. In addition, care of the animals-including frequent health examinations, blood testing (complete blood count, biochemistry panels, heartworm tests), and daily care-are labor intensive for veterinarian and support staff alike. Other options include using staff-or client-owned animals as donors. This practice eliminates the expense of housing donors within the clinic and the labor required for daily care.

Add 2.5 mL 0.9% sodium chloride solution from wash bottle to each red blood cell tube, using some force to cause cells to mix. 8. Centrifuge RBC suspension for 2 minutes. 9. Discard supernatant and resuspend RBCs with 0.9% sodium chloride from wash bottle. 10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 for a total of three washes. 11. Place two drops of donor RBC suspension and two drops of recipient plasma in tube labeled Ma (this is the major crossmatch). 12. Place two drops of donor plasma and two drops of recipient RBC suspension in tube labeled Mi (this is the minor crossmatch). 13. Prepare control tubes by placing two drops of donor plasma with two drops of donor RBC suspension (this is the donor control); and place two drops of recipient plasma with two drops of recipient RBC suspension (this is the recipient control). 14. Incubate major and minor crossmatches and control tubes at room temperature for 15 minutes. 15. Centrifuge all tubes for 1 minute. 16. Read tubes using an agglutination viewer. 17.

First, knowledge of a patient's blood type is essential. Whenever possible, type-specific RBCs should be administered. If an animal has received prior transfusion(s), the risk of a transfusion reaction or rejection is increased because of the development of antibodies directed against glycoprotein moieties on the surface of RBCs. If a prior transfusion has taken place, the patient's blood (RBCs and plasma) must be crossmatched with the donor blood (RBCs and plasma) to make sure that no incompatibility exists. In dogs, if neither a blood typing nor a crossmatch procedure is available or if the emergent situation requires that a transfusion be administered before blood typing or crossmatch can be performed, blood from a universal donor (e.g., DEA 1.1-, 1.2-, and 1.7-negative) should be administered whenever possible.

Blood warmer units are available for use in veterinary medicine to facilitate rapid transfusion without decreasing patient body temperature.

Smaller in-line filters (20 \u03bcm) also can be used in cases in which extremely small volumes are to be administered. Blood products should be administered over a period of 4 hours, whenever possible, according to guidelines set by the American Association of Blood Banks. The volume of blood components required to achieve a specific increment in the patient's PCV depends largely on whether whole blood or packed RBCs are transfused and whether there is ongoing hemorrhage or RBC destruction. Because the PCV of packed RBCs is unusually high (80% for Greyhound blood), a smaller total volume than with whole blood is required to achieve a comparable increase in the patient's PCV. In general, 10 mL of packed RBCs per kilogram or 20 mL of whole blood per kilogram will raise the recipient's PCV by 10%. The \"Rule of Ones\" states that 1 mL per 1 lb of whole blood will raise the PCV by 1%. If the patient's PCV does not raise by the amount anticipated by the foregoing calculation(s), causes of ongoing hemorrhage or destruction should be considered.

Next, insert the male end of a three-way stopcock into the female end of the extension tubing. 3. Attach a 20-mL syringe filled with heparinized sterile 0.9% saline to one of the female ports of the three-way stopcock and either a manometer or a second length of intravenous extension tubing attached to a metric ruler. 4. Lay the patient in lateral or sternal recumbency. 5. Turn the stopcock OFF to the manometer or ruler and ON to the patient. Infuse a small amount of heparinized saline through the catheter to flush the catheter. 6. Next, turn the stopcock OFF to the patient and ON to the manometer. Gently flush the manometer or length of extension tubing with heparinized saline from the syringe. Use care not to agitate the fluid and create air bubbles within the line or manometer, which will artifactually change the CVP measured. 7. Next, lower the 0 cm point on the manometer or ruler to the level of the patient's manubrium (if the patient is in lateral recumbency) or the point of the elbow (if the patient is in sternal recumbency). 8. Turn the stopcock OFF to the syringe, and allow the fluid column to equilibrate with the patient's intravascular volume. Once the fluid column stops falling and the level rises and falls with the patient's heartbeat, measure the number adjacent to the bottom of the meniscus of the fluid column. This is the CVP in centimeters of water (see Figure 1 -4). 9. Repeat the measurement several times with the patient in the same position to make sure that none of the values has been increased or decreased artifactually in error. Alternately, attach the central catheter to a pressure transducer and perform electronic monitoring of CVP. There is no absolute value for normal CVP. The normal CVP for small animal patients is 0 to 5 cm H 2 O. Values less than 0 cm H 2 O are associated with absolute or relative hypovolemia. Values of 5 to 10 cm H 2 O represent borderline hypervolemia, and values greater than 10 cm H 2 O suggest intravascular volume overload. Values greater than 15 cm H 2 O may be correlated with congestive heart failure (CHF) and the development of pulmonary edema. In individual patients, the trend in change in CVP is more important than absolute values. As a rule of thumb, when using CVP measurements to gauge fluid therapy and avoid vascular and pulmonary overload, the CVP should not increase by more than 5 cm H 2 O in any 24-hour period. If an abrupt increase in CVP is found, repeat the measurement to make sure that the elevated value was not obtained in error. If the value truly has increased dramatically, temporarily discontinue fluid therapy and consider administration of a diuretic. ",

Serum potassium is regulated by the actions of the sodium-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase pump on cellular membranes, including those of the renal tubular epithelium. Inorganic metabolic acidosis artifactually can raise serum potassium levels because of redistribution of extracellular potassium in exchange for intracellular hydrogen ion movement in an attempt to correct serum pH. Potassium is one of the major players in the maintenance of resting membrane potentials of excitable tissue, including neurons and cardiac myocytes. Changes in serum potassium can affect cardiac conduction adversely. Hyperkalemia lowers the resting membrane potential and makes cardiac cells, particularly those of the atria, more susceptible to depolarization. Characteristic signs of severe hyperkalemia that can be observed on an ECG rhythm strip include an absence of P waves, widened QRS complexes, and tall tented or spiked T waves. Further increases in serum potassium can be associated with bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac asystole (death). Treatment of hyperkalemia consists of administration of insulin (0.25 to 0.5 units/kg, intravenous regular insulin) and dextrose (1 g dextrose per unit of insulin administered, followed by 2.5% dextrose IV via constant rate infusion (CRI) to prevent hypoglycemia), calcium (2 to 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate administered IV slowly to effect), or sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg IV slowly). Insulin plus dextrose and bicarbonate therapy help drive the potassium intracellularly, whereas calcium antagonizes the effect of hyperkalemia on the myocardial cells. All of the treatments work within minutes, although the effects are relatively short-lived (20 minutes to 1 hour) unless the cause of the hyperkalemia is identified and treated appropriately (Box 1-10). Dilution of serum potassium also results from restoring intravascular fluid volume and correcting metabolic acidosis, in most cases. Treatment with a fluid that does not contain potassium (preferably 0.9% sodium chloride) is recommended.",

Serum sodium concentration is an indication of the amount of sodium relative to water in the extracellular fluid and provides no direct information about the total body sodium content. Patients with hyponatremia or hypernatremia may have decreased, normal, or increased total body sodium content (Boxes 1-12 and 1-13). An increased serum sodium concentration implies hyperosmolality, whereas a decrease in serum sodium concentration usually, but not always, implies hypoosmolality. The severity of clinical signs of hypernatremia and hyponatremia is related primarily to the rapidity of the onset of the change rather than to the magnitude of the associated plasma hyperosmolality or hypoosmolality. Clinical signs of neurologic disturbances include disorientation, ataxia, and seizures, and coma may occur at serum sodium concentrations less than 120 mEq/L or greater than 170 mEq/L in dogs. Therapy for hypernatremia or hyponatremia with fluid containing low or higher concentrations of sodium should proceed with caution, because rapid changes (decreases or increases) in serum sodium and osmolality can cause rapid changes in the intracellular and extracellular fluid flux, leading to intracellular dehydration or edema, even though the serum sodium has not been returned to normal. A rule of thumb is to not raise or lower the serum sodium by more than 15 mEq/L during any one 24-hour period. Restoration of the serum sodium concentration over a period of 48 to 72 hours is better. In almost all circumstances, an animal will correct its sodium balance with simple fluid restoration. If severe hypernatremia exists that suggests a free water deficit, however, the free water deficit should be calculated from the following formula: Hypernatremia can be corrected slowly with 0.45% sodium chloride plus 2.5% dextrose, 5% dextrose in water, or lactated Ringer's solution (sodium content 130 mEq/L).

When administered with a crystalloid, a colloid serves to hold or retain the crystalloid fluid within the vascular space for a longer time than if the crystalloid fluid were administered alone. Because of this property, colloids can promote better tissue perfusion at lower infusion volumes and equivalent colloid oncotic pressures and mean BPs than crystalloids. Administer the synthetic colloids in incremental boluses of 5 to 10 mL/kg over 5 to 15 minutes during the treatment of hypotension. When synthetic colloids are administered for maintenance of colloidal oncotic pressure in hypoalbuminemic or hypoproteinemic patients, the recommended dose is 20 to 30 mL/kg/day as a CRI. Because colloids retain fluid in the vascular space, the volume of crystalloid fluid infused (maintenance + deficit + ongoing losses) should be decreased by 25% to 50% to avoid vascular volume overload. Two major classes of colloids exist: natural and synthetic. Natural colloids (whole blood, packed RBCs, plasma) are discussed elsewhere in this text. Concentrated human albumin and canine specific purified concentrated albumin are natural purified colloids that recently have become more popular in the treatment of advanced hypoalbuminemia and hypoproteinemia and will be discussed here.

The 5% solution has an osmolality similar to that of serum (308 mOsm/L), whereas the 25% solution is hyperoncotic (1500 mOsm/L). A 25% albumin solution draws fluid from the interstitial space into the intravascular space. Concentrated albumin solutions often are used to restore circulating volume when synthetic colloids are not available. Albumin not only is important at maintaining the colloidal oncotic pressure of blood but also serves as a valuable free-radical scavenger and carrier of drugs and hormones necessary for normal tissue function and healing. Albumin levels less than 2.0 g/dL have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Concentrated human albumin solutions can be administered as an effective method of restoring interstitial and serum albumin concentrations in situations of acute and chronic hypoalbuminemia. Albumin (25%) is available in 50-and 100-mL vials and is more cost-efficient as an albumin replacement than fresh frozen plasma when procurement and administration are considered. Recommended albumin infusion rates are 2 to 5 mL/kg over 4 hours, after pretreatment with diphenhydramine. Although concentrated human albumin is structurally similar to canine albumin, closely monitor the patient for signs of allergic reaction during and after the infusion. Experimentally, concentrated infusion of human albumin into normoalbuminemic healthy dogs has resulted in the development of antialbumin antibodies, urticaria, fever, and acute anaphylaxis leading to death. Extreme reactions, however, have not been reported in clinically hypoalbuminemic patients into which albumin was infused. Polyarthritis and urticaria have also been documented within 3 weeks of albumin infusion. For these reasons, albumin therapy may be beneficial, but it is not innocuous. The perceived benefit must outweigh the potential risk of acute and chronic reactions in canine patients.",

Alternately, a temporary tracheostomy can be performed and the patient can be maintained on a plane of light to heavy sedation and ventilated through the tracheostomy site. This method, although technically more invasive initially, allows the patient to be awake despite requiring mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation is required in the most critically ill animals. If mechanical ventilation is required, 24-hour one-on-one veterinary care is necessary. ",

A pulse oximeter uses different wavelengths of light to distinguish characteristic differences in the properties of the different molecules in a fluid or gas mixture-in this case, oxygenated (oxyhemoglobin) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyhemoglobin) in pulsatile blood. The process is termed pulse oximetry. Oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin are different molecules that absorb and reflect different wavelengths of light. Oxyhemoglobin absorbs light in the infrared spectrum, allowing wavelengths of light in the red spectrum to transmit through it. Conversely, deoxyhemoglobin absorbs wavelengths of the red spectrum and allows wavelengths in the infrared spectrum to transmit through the molecule. The spectrophotometer in the pulse oximeter transmits light in the red (660 nm) and infrared (920 nm) spectra. The different wavelengths of light are transmitted across a pulsatile vascular bed and are detected by a photodetector on the other side. The photodetector processes the amount of light of varying wavelengths that reaches it, then transmits an electrical current to a processor that calculates the difference in the amount of light originally transmitted and the amount of light of similar wavelength that actually reaches the photodetector. The difference in each reflects the amount of light absorbed in the pulsatile blood and can be used to calculate the amount or ratio of oxyhemoglobin to deoxyhemoglobin in circulation, or the functional hemoglobin saturation, by the following formula: where Hbo 2 is oxygenated hemoglobin, and Hb is deoxygenated hemoglobin. Four molecules of oxygen reversibly bind to hemoglobin for transport to the tissues. Carbon monoxide similarly binds to hemoglobin and forms carboxyhemoglobin, a molecule that is detected similarly to oxygenated hemoglobin. Thus Sao 2 as detected by a pulse oximeter is not reliable if carboxyhemoglobin is present.",

Normally, at the onset of exhalation the gas exhaled into the expiratory limb of the tubing comes from the upper airway or physiologic dead space and contains relatively little carbon dioxide. As exhalation continues, a steep uphill slope occurs as more carbon dioxide is exhaled from the bronchial tree. Near the end of exhalation, the capnogram reaches a plateau, which most accurately reflects the carbon dioxide level at the level of the alveolus. Because carbon dioxide diffuses across the alveolar basement membrane so rapidly, this reflects arterial carbon dioxide levels. If a plateau is not reached and notching of the waveform occurs, check the system for leaks. If the baseline waveform does not reach zero, the patient may be rebreathing carbon dioxide or may be tachypneic, causing physiologic positive end-expiratory pressure. The Sodasorb in the system should be replaced if it has expired. Conversely, low end-tidal carbon dioxide may be associated with a decrease in perfusion or blood flow. Decreased perfusion can be associated with low end-tidal carbon dioxide values, particularly during cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR). End-tidal carbon dioxide levels are one of the most accurate predictors of the efficacy of CPCR and patient outcome. In addition, the difference between arterial carbon dioxide levels (Paco 2 ) and end-tidal carbon dioxide can be used to calculate dead-space ventilation.

Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory or emotional experience associated with actual or perceived tissue damage. Until recognition of a noxious stimulus occurs in the cerebral cortex, no response or adaptation results. Rational management of pain requires an understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in pain and an appreciation of how analgesic agents interact to disrupt pain mechanisms. Multiple factors and causes produce pain in human beings and domestic animal species. The causes of pain, psychological and physical, may derive from many different mechanisms within emergency medicine, among them trauma, infectious disease, neglect, environmental stress, surgery, and acute decompensation of chronic medical conditions. The two major classes of pain are acute and chronic pain. Box 1-20 gives specific categories and causes of pain.",

Current analgesic therapies may inhibit afferent nociceptive transmission within the brain and spinal cord; directly interrupt neural impulse conduction through the dorsal horn, primary afferent nerves, or dorsal root ganglion; or prevent the nociceptor sensitization that accompanies initial pain and inflammation. The physiologic aspects of pain are believed to be produced by the transmission, transduction, and integration of information from initial nerve endings, peripheral neuronal input, and ascending afferent nerves via the thalamus to the cerebral cortex. Ascending afferent nerves to the limbic system are believed to be responsible for the emotional aspects of pain.",

Acute pain, such as the pain that results from trauma, surgery, or infectious agents, is abrupt in onset, is relatively short in duration, and may be alleviated easily by analgesics. In contrast, chronic pain is a long-standing physical disorder or emotional distress that is slow in onset and difficult to treat. Both types of pain can be classified further based on site of origin. Somatic pain arises from superficial skin, subcutaneous tissue, body wall, or appendages. Visceral pain arises from abdominal or thoracic viscera and primarily is associated with serosal irritation. Analgesia, then, is the loss of pain without the loss of consciousness. This is in contrast to anesthesia, which is the loss of sensation in the whole body or a part of the body with the loss of consciousness or at least depression of the CNS.",

A catabolic state is created as a result of increased secretion of catabolic hormones and decreased secretion of anabolic hormones. The net effect the majority of neurohormonal changes produce is an increase in the secretion of catabolic hormones. Hyperglycemia is produced and may persist because of production of glucagon and relative lack of insulin. Lipolytic activity is stimulated by cortisol, catecholamines, and growth hormone. Cardiorespiratory effects of pain include increased cardiac output, vasoconstriction, hypoxemia, and hyperventilation. Protein catabolism is a common occurrence and major concern regarding healing.

Labrador Retrievers tend to be stoic, whereas Greyhounds and teacup breeds tend to react with a heightened state of arousal around even the simplest of procedures (e.g., subcutaneous injections and nail trims). The individual character and temperament of the animal further influences its response. Pediatric and neonatal animals seem to have a lower threshold for pain and anxiety than older animals. In any species, the duration and type of pain make it more (acute) or less (chronic) likely to be expressed or exhibited outwardly. Unfamiliarity with normal behaviors typical of a particular species or breed makes recognition of their pain behaviors and responses impossible.",

            "text": "An opioid is any natural or synthetic drug that is derived from the poppy, which interacts with opiate receptors identified on cell membranes. The drugs from this class constitute the most effective means of controlling acute, perioperative, and chronic pain in human and veterinary medicine (Table 1 -16) . Their physiologic effects result from the interaction with one or more of at least five endogenous opioid receptors (\u03bc, \u03c3, \u03b4, \u03b5, and \u03ba). \u03bc-Receptor agonists are noted for their ability to produce profound analgesia with mild sedation. These drugs diminish \"windup, \" the hyperexcitable state resulting from an afferent volley of nociceptive impulses. They elevate the pain threshold and are used preemptively to prevent acute pain. As a class, opioids cause CNS depression with their intense analgesia. Dose-related respiratory depression reflects diminished response to carbon dioxide levels. Cardiac depression is secondary only to bradycardia and is more likely with certain opioids such as morphine and oxymorphone. Narcotics produce few if any clinically significant cardiovascular effects in dogs and cats; they are considered cardiac soothing or sparing. Because opioids increase intracranial and intraocular pressure, use them more cautiously in patients with severe cranial trauma and or ocular lesions. Opioids directly stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone and may cause nausea and vomiting. Most opioids depress the cough reflex via a central mechanism; this may be helpful in patients recovering from endotracheal intubation irritation. A key characteristic of opioids that makes them desirable for use in emergency and critical care situations is their reversibility. Antagonists block or reverse the effect of agonists by combining with receptors and producing minimal or no effects. Administer all reversal agents, such as naloxone and naltrexone, slowly if given intravenously and to effect. a 2 -AgonisTs As a class of drugs, \u03b1 2 -agonists warrant special attention because most members of the group possess potent analgesic power at doses that are capable of causing sedation, CNS depression, cardiovascular depression, and even general anesthetic states. Originally developed for antihypertensive use, \u03b1 2 -agonists quickly have attained sedative analgesic status in veterinary medicine (Table 1 -17) . Like the opioids, \u03b1 2 -agonists produce their effects by aggravating \u03b1-adrenergic receptors in the CNS and periphery.",

Recently developed potent oral and parenteral forms of these drugs have compared favorably with and sometimes superiorly to opioids for treatment of acute inflammation and pain (Table 1 -18) . Nonsteroidal drugs can be used alone, but their best use is that of providing synergistic analgesia with different classes of analgesics (narcotics) or modalities (local, regional, and epidural analgesia, physical therapy, acupuncture). Most NSAIDS act by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX; also known as prostaglandin synthetase), an enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of molecular oxygen into arachidonic acid to produce mediators of inflammation. There are at least a few forms of COX, among them COX-1, the major constitutive enzyme primarily involved in normal physiologic functions, and COX-2, the enzyme responsible for most of the hyperalgesia and pain responses experienced after tissue injury or trauma. Some NSAIDS inhibit COX and lipoxygenase activity. Most of the currently available oral and parenteral NSAIDS for small t a B l e 1 -1 7 a 2 -agonists used for analgesia and sedation 1 animal medicine and surgery target the COX pathways predominantly, although one (tepoxalin) is thought to inhibit both pathways. Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 can inhibit the protective effects and impair platelet aggregation and lead to gastrointestinal ulceration. There are definite contraindications and relative contraindications for the use of NSAIDs. NSAIDs should not be administered to patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency, dehydration, hypotension, or conditions that are associated with low circulating volume (CHF, unregulated anesthesia, shock), or evidence of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease. Trauma patients should be stabilized completely regarding vascular volume, tone, and pressure before the use of NSAIDs. Patients receiving concurrent administration of other NSAIDs or corticosteroids, or those considered to be cushingoid, should be evaluated carefully for an adequate \"washout\" period (time of clearance of drug from the system) before use of an NSAID or before switching NSAIDs. Patients with coagulopathies, particularly those that are caused by platelet number or function defects or those caused by factor deficiencies, and patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma or other bronchial disease are probably not the patients in which to use NSAIDs. Other advice is that NSAIDs not be administered to pregnant patients or to females attempting to become pregnant because COX-2 induction is necessary for ovulation and subsequent implantation of the embryo. The administration of NSAIDs should be considered only in the well-hydrated, normotensive dog or cat with normal renal or hepatic function, with no hemostatic abnormalities and no concurrent steroid administration.",

Lidocaine provides for quick, short-acting sensory and motor impairment. Bupivacaine provides for later-onset, longer-lasting desensitization without motor impairment. Combinations of the two agents diluted with saline are used frequently to provide for quick-onset analgesia that lasts 4 to 6 hours in most patients. Adding a narcotic and/or an \u03b1 2 agent often maximizes the analgesia and increases the pain-free interval to 8 to 18 hours. Epinephrine-free and preservative-free solutions are recommended. Precision placement of anesthetic close to nerves, roots, or plexuses is improved with the use of a stimulating nerve locator. Cats seem to be more sensitive to the effects of local anesthetics; therefore the lower ends of most dose ranges are used for blockades in this species. Unlike most instances of general anesthesia, during which the animal is rendered unconscious and nerve transmission is decreased by virtue of CNS depression, local and regional techniques block the initiation of noxious signals, thereby effectively preventing pain from entering the CNS. This is an effective means not only of preventing initial pain but also of reducing the changes that take place in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, spinothalamic tracts, limbic and reticular activating centers, and cortex. Frequently the neurohormonal response that is stimulated in pain and stress is blunted as well. Overall, the patient has fewer local and systemic adverse effects of pain, disease processes are minimized, chronic pain states are unlikely, and outcome is improved. Regional techniques are best used as part of an analgesic regimen that consists of their continuous administration, narcotics, \u03b1-agonists, anxiolytics, and good nursing.",

Epidural anesthesia refers to the injection of a local anesthetic. In most patients a combination of the two is used. Epidural analgesia and anesthesia are used for acute and chronic surgical pain or traumatically induced pain in the pelvis, tail, perineum, hind limbs, abdomen, and thorax ( Table 1 -21) . Procedures in which epidural analgesia and anesthesia are useful include forelimb and hindlimb amputation, tail or perineal procedures, cesarean sections, diaphragmatic hernia repair, pancreatitis, peritonitis, and intervertebral disk disease. Epidural blocks performed using opioids or bupivacaine will not result in hindlimb paresis or decreased urinary or anal tone (incontinence), unlike lidocaine or mepivacaine epidural blocks. Morphine is one of the most useful opioids for administration in the epidural space because of its slow systemic absorption. Epidural catheters used for the instillation of drugs through CRI or intermittent injection can be placed in dogs and cats. Routinely placed at the lumbosacral junction, these catheters are used with cocktails including preservative-free morphine, bupivacaine, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine. Extremely effective for preventing windup pain in the peritoneal cavity or caudal half of the body, the catheters may be maintained if placed aseptically for 7 to 14 days.",

Abnormal postures can include generalized rigidity, walking tenderly or as if \"on eggshells, \" or a prayer position in which the front limbs are lowered to the ground while the hind end remains standing. In some cases it may be difficult initially to distinguish between true abdominal pain or referred pain from intervertebral disk disease.

Abdominocentesis is a sensitive technique for detecting peritoneal effusion in the presence of more than 6 mL/kg of fluid within the abdominal cavity. Abdominal effusion collected should be saved for bacterial culture and evaluated biochemically and cytologically based on your index of suspicion of the primary disease process. If creatinine, BUN, or potassium is elevated compared with that of serum, uroabdomen is present. Elevated abdominal fluid lipase or amylase compared with serum supports a diagnosis of pancreatitis. Elevated lactate compared with serum lactate or an abdominal fluid glucose level less than 50 mg/dL is highly sensitive and specific for bacterial or septic peritonitis. The presence of bile pigment or bacteria is supportive of bile and septic peritonitis, respectively. Free fibers in abdominal fluid along with clinical signs of abdominal pain strongly support gastrointestinal perforation, and immediate surgical exploration is required.",

The best means to explore the abdominal cavity accurately and thoroughly is to open the abdomen on midline from the level of the xiphoid process caudally to the pubis for full exposure and then to evaluate all organs in every quadrant in a systematic manner. Address specific problems such as gastric or splenic torsion, enteroplication, and foreign body removal, and then copiously lavage the abdomen with warmed sterile saline solution. Suction the saline solution thoroughly from the peritoneal cavity so as to not impair macrophage function. In cases of septic peritonitis, the abdomen may be left open, or a drain may be placed for further suction and lavage. The routine use of antibiotics in irrigation solutions is contraindicated because the antibiotics can irritate the peritoneum and delay healing. When the abdominal cavity is left open, secure sterile laparotomy towels and water-impermeable dressings over the abdominal wound with umbilical tape, and then change these daily or as strike-through occurs. Open abdomen cases are often effusive and require meticulous evaluation and management of electrolyte imbalances and hypoalbuminemia. The abdomen can be closed and/or the abdominal drain removed when the volume of the effusion decreases, when bacteria are no longer present, and when the neutrophils become more healthy in appearance.

Remember that the single best method of detecting cardiac dysrhythmias is with your fingertips (palpate a pulse or apex heartbeat) and ears (auscultate the heart). Confirm the dysrhythmia by auscultating the heart rate and rhythm, identify the P waves and the QRS complexes, and evaluate the relationship between the P waves and QRS complexes. Is there a P wave for every QRS complex, and a QRS complex for every P wave? During anesthesia, fluid, acid-base, and electrolyte imbalances can predispose the patient to dysrhythmias. Sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation, including during the process of intubation, can predispose the patient to dysrhythmias. If the patient's plane of anesthesia is too light, perception of pain can cause catecholamine release, sensitizing the myocardium to ectopic beats.

Abnormalities found on physical examination may aid in determining whether the hemorrhage is localized or generalized (e.g., bleeding from a venipuncture site versus bleeding diathesis). Note whether the clinical signs are associated with a platelet problem and superficial hemorrhage or whether deep bleeding can be associated with abnormalities of the coagulation cascade. Also, make an attempt to identify any concurrent illness that can predispose the patient to a bleeding disorder (e.g., pancreatitis, snakebite, sepsis, immunemediated hemolytic anemia, or severe trauma and crush or burn injury). Abnormalities associated with coagulopathies include petechiae and ecchymoses, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hematuria, hemarthrosis, melena, and hemorrhagic cavity (pleural and peritoneal or retroperitoneal) effusions.",

Early in DIC the procoagulant cascade dominates, with hypercoagulability. ACT, APTT, and PT may be rapid and shorter than normal. In most cases, we do not recognize the hypercoagulable state in our critically ill patients. Later in DIC, as platelets and activated clotting factors become consumed, the ACT, APTT, and PT become prolonged. Antithrombin (AT), a natural anticoagulant, also becomes consumed, and AT levels decline. AT levels can be measured at commercial laboratories and in some large veterinary institutions.

The first is autosomal recessive disease, in which homozygous von Willebrand disease individuals have a bleeding disorder, whereas heterozygous individuals carry the trait but are clinically normal. The second variant of genetic expression involves an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete expression such that heterozygous individuals are affected carriers and homozygous individuals are severely affected. Von Willebrand disease has high morbidity but fortunately a low mortality. Dogs with 30% or less than normal vWF tend to hemorrhage. Platelet counts are normal, but bleeding times can be prolonged. The APTT can be slightly prolonged when factor VIII is less than 50% of normal. Routine screening tests are nondiagnostic for this disease, although in a predisposed breed with a normal platelet count, a prolonged buccal mucosa bleeding time strongly supports a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease. Documentation of clinical bleeding with low or undetectable levels of factor VIII antigen or platelet-related activities of vWF support a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease. Recessive animals have zero vWF antigen (a subunit of factor III); heterozygotes have 15% to 60% of normal. In the incompletely dominant form, levels of vWF antigen are reduced (less than 7% to 60%). Clinical signs in affected animals include epistaxis, hematuria, diarrhea with melena, penile bleeding, lameness, hemarthrosis, hematoma formation, and excessive bleeding with routine procedures such as nail trimming, ear cropping, tail docking, surgical procedures (spay, neuter), and lacerations. Estrus and postpartum bleeding may be prolonged. A DNA test to detect carriers of the vWF gene is available through VetGen (Ann Arbor, Michigan) and Michigan State University.

The location of the burn is also important in assessing its severity and potential to cause loss of function. Burns on the perineum, feet, face, and ears are considered to be the most severe because of loss of function and severe pain. Often the severity of thermal injury is difficult to assess in animals because the hair coat potentially can mask clinical signs and because the thermal injury can continue after the animal has been removed from the heat source. The skin cools slowly and warms slowly, considerations that become important when initiating therapy for burns. The severity of thermal injury is associated with the temperature to which the animal is exposed, the duration of contact, and the ability of the tissue to dissipate heat. The tissue closest to the heat source undergoes necrosis and has decreased blood flow. The severity of thermal burn injury is associated directly with the temperature to which the animal is exposed, the percentage of total body surface area affected, the thickness of injured tissue, and whether underlying complications with other body systems occur. Prognosis largely depends on the total body surface area affected ( Superficial partial-thickness, or first-degree, burns offer the most favorable prognosis. The affected epidermis initially appears erythematous and then quickly desquamates within 3 to 6 days. In most cases fur grows back without a scar. Deep partial-thickness, or second-degree, burns involve the epidermis and dermis and are associated with subcutaneous edema, inflammation, and pain. Deep partial-thickness burns heal from deeper adnexal tissues and from the wound edges and are associated with an increased chance of scarring and depigmentation. The most severe type is the full-thickness, or third-degree, burn, in which thermal injury destroys the entire thickness of the skin and forms an eschar. Thrombosis of superficial and deeper skin vasculature and gangrene occur. Treatment involves sequential wound debridement. Healing occurs by second intention and reepithelialization or by wound reconstruction. In most cases scarring is extensive in affected areas.",

Use care to avoid overcooling and iatrogenic hypothermia. The best approach is to cool only one portion of the patient's body at a time, then dry, and repeat the process for all affected areas to avoid overcooling and iatrogenic hypothermia. Establish vascular access and administer appropriate and judicious analgesic drugs and intravenous fluid therapy. Whenever possible, avoid placing a catheter through an area of burned or damaged skin. In the early stages of burn injury, shock doses of intravenous crystalloid fluids usually are not required. Later, however, as severe tissue exudation occurs, protein and fluid losses can become extensive, necessitating aggressive crystalloid and colloid support to treat hypovolemia and hypoproteinemia.

Central venous catheters can be placed to administer crystalloid and colloid fluids, parenteral nutrition if necessary, antibiotics, and analgesic drugs.

Respiratory function can be impaired because of concurrent smoke inhalation, thermal damage to the upper airways and alveoli, and carboxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin intoxication. Respiratory function also can be impaired because of burn injury to the skin around the thoracic cage. Thoracic radiographs may reveal patchy interstitial to alveolar infiltrates associated with pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and atelectasis. Bronchoscopy often reveals edema, inflammation, particulate matter, and ulceration of the tracheobronchial tree. In some cases, upper airway inflammation is so severe that an emergency tracheostomy must be performed to treat airway obstruction. Administer supplemental humidified oxygen at 50 to 100 mL/kg/min via endotracheal tube, tracheostomy, nasal or intratracheal tube, or hood oxygen if respiratory function and hypoxemia are present.

Recently, the paradigm has shifted to CABs. While a team member is grabbing an endotracheal tube, clearing the airway of foreign debris, and establishing airway access through endotracheal intubation, a second person starts external cardiac compressions to deliver oxygen that is in the bloodstream to the vital organs. The patient should be positioned in dorsal (>7 kg) or lateral (<7 kg) recumbency for external cardiac compressions. Approximately 80 to 120 external compressions should be performed over the patient's sternum. A team member should palpate for a peripheral pulse to determine whether cardiac compressions are actually effective. If a peripheral pulse cannot be palpated for every chest compression, change the patient's position and have a larger individual perform compressions, or initiate open-chest cardiac resuscitation. Once the patient has been intubated, tie in the endotracheal tube and attach it to an oxygen source (anesthetic machine or mechanical ventilator or Ambu bag) for artificial ventilation. The oxygen flow rate should be 150 mL/kg/min. Give two long breaths, and then 12 to 16 breaths per minute. Simultaneous ventilation with thoracic compression increases the pressure difference in the thorax and allows more forward flow of oxygenated blood through the great vessels into the periphery. If possible, a third team member can initiate interposed abdominal compressions, compressing the abdomen when the thoracic cage is relaxed, to improve forward flow. If only one person is available to perform the thoracic compressions and ventilation, give two breaths for every 15 compressions (i.e., 15 thoracic compressions followed by two long breaths, and then start thoracic compressions again). The Jen Chung maneuver can be performed by placing a 25-to 22-gauge hypodermic needle through the skin of the nasal philtrum and twisting the needle into the periosteum to stimulate respirations.

Therefore only in select instances is it necessary to establish vascular or intraosseous access during CPCR (Figure 1-27 ).

If a patient is euvolemic and experiences cardiopulmonary arrest, however, an increase in circulating fluid volume actually can impair coronary artery perfusion by increasing diastolic arterial BP and is therefore contraindicated.

The consequence is decreased cardiac output and decreased coronary artery perfusion. The goal of therapy is rhythm control or, in most cases, rate control. In cases of atrial fibrillation and CHF, conversion to a normal sinus rhythm rarely can be achieved, although electrocardioversion or pharmacoconversion can be attempted.",

More rarely, other causes of pericardial effusion include benign idiopathic pericardial effusion, coagulopathy, left atrial rupture in dogs with chronic mitral valvular insufficiency, infection, or pericardial cysts. Regardless of the cause of the effusion, the development of pericardial tamponade adversely affects cardiac output. Cardiac output is a function of heart rate and stroke volume. Stroke volume depends on cardiac preload. The presence of pericardial effusion can impede venous return to the heart and thus adversely affect preload. In addition, as preload decreases, heart rate reflexively increases in an attempt to maintain normal cardiac output. As heart rate increases more than 160 beats/min, diastolic filling is impaired further, and cardiac output further declines. Animals with pericardial effusion often demonstrate the classic signs of hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock: anorexia, weakness, lethargy, cyanosis, cool peripheral extremities, tachycardia, weak thready pulses, hypotension, and collapse. Physical examination abnormalities may include muffled heart sounds, thready femoral pulses, pulsus paradoxus, jugular venous distension, weakness, tachycardia, cyanosis, and tachypnea.

Thoracic radiographs often demonstrate a globoid cardiac silhouette, although the cardiac silhouette rarely may appear 1 normal with concurrent clinical signs of cardiogenic shock in cases of acute hemorrhage. In such cases the removal of even small amounts of pericardial effusion by pericardiocentesis can increase cardiac output exponentially and alleviate clinical signs (Table 1-35) . Unless an animal is dying before your eyes, ideally perform an echocardiogram to attempt to determine whether a right atrial, right auricular, or heart base mass is present before pericardiocentesis.",

Ventricular fibrillation can occur, although that depends on the intensity and path of the electrical current and duration of contact. Clinical signs of electrical injury include acute onset of respiratory distress with moist rales, and localized necrosis or thermal burns of the lips and tongue.

Application of a hypertonic solution such as hypertonic (7%) saline or dextrose (50%) to the exposed endometrium can help shrink the tissue. That, combined with gentle massage to stimulate uterine contraction and involution and lubrication with sterile lubricating jelly, can aid in replacement of the organ into its proper place. To ensure proper placement in the abdominal cavity and to prevent recurrence, perform an exploratory laparotomy and hysteropexy. Postoperatively, administer oxytocin (5 to 20 units IM) to cause uterine contraction. If the uterus contracts, it is usually not necessary to suture the vulva. Administer antibiotics postoperatively.

Brachycephalic breeds, obese animals, dogs with laryngeal paralysis, and older animals with cardiovascular disease can be particularly affected. Hyperthermia is defined as a rectal temperature of 41\u00b0 to 43\u00b0 C (105\u00b0 to 110\u00b0 F). Clinical signs of hyperthermia include congested hyperemic mucous membranes, tachycardia, and panting. More severe clinical signs include collapse (heat prostration), ataxia, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersalivation, muscle tremors, loss of consciousness, and seizures. Heat-induced illness can affect all major organ systems in the body because of denaturation of cellular proteins and enzyme activities, inappropriate shunting of blood, hypotension, decreased oxygen delivery, and lactic acidosis. Cardiac dysrhythmias, interstitial and intracellular dehydration, intravascular hypovolemia, central nervous dysfunction, slough of gastrointestinal mucosa, oliguria, and coagulopathies can be seen as organ function declines. Excessive panting can result in respiratory alkalosis. Poor tissue perfusion results in metabolic acidosis. Loss of water in excess of solutes such as sodium and chloride can lead to a free water deficit and severe hypernatremia. A marked increase in PCV occurs because of the free water loss. Severe abnormalities in electrolytes and pH can lead to cerebral edema and death.",

Cold water and ice will cause extreme peripheral vasoconstriction, inhibiting the patient's ability to dissipate heat through conductive and convective cooling mechanisms. As a result, core body temperature will continue to rise despite the good intentions of attendants at the scene. Animals that have been cooled to the point of hypothermia have a worse prognosis. Once the animal has been presented to the veterinarian, the goal is to cool the animal's body temperature with towels soaked in tepid water, cool intravenous fluids, and fans until the temperature has decreased to 103\u00b0 F.

In long-haired breeds, clipping the fur near the fracture site often is necessary to perform a thorough examination of the area.

In some cases the open fracture is obvious, with a large section of bone fragment protruding through the skin. In other cases the puncture wound may be subtle, with only a small amount of blood or a pinpoint hole in the skin surface. Characteristics observed with open fractures include bone penetration, fat droplets or marrow elements in blood coming from the wound, subcutaneous emphysema on radiographs, and lacerations in the area of a fracture. Protect the patient from further injury or contamination of wounds. Excessive palpation to intentionally produce crepitus is inappropriate because it causes severe patient 1 discomfort and has the potential to cause severe soft tissue and neurologic injury at the fracture site. Sedation and analgesia aid in making the examination more comfortable for the patient and allow localization of the injury and comparison with the opposite extremity.

In the absence of insulin, unregulated lipolysis results in the \u03b2-hydroxylation of fatty acids by abnormal hepatic metabolism. As a result, ketoacidsnamely, acetoacetic acid, \u03b2-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone-are produced. Early in the course of the disease, patients exhibit clinical signs associated with diabetes mellitus: weight loss, polyuria, polyphagia, and polydipsia. Later, as ketoacids stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone, vomiting and dehydration occur, with resulting hypovolemia, hypotension, severe depression, abdominal pain, oliguria, and coma. At the time of presentation, often a strong odor of ketones (acetone) is present on the patient's breath. Physical examination often reveals dehydration, severe depression or coma, and hypovolemic shock. In extreme cases the patient exhibits a slow, deep Kussmaul respiratory pattern in an attempt to blow off excess CO 2 to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. A serum biochemistry profile and complete blood count often reveal prerenal azotemia, severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose >400 mg/dL), hyperosmolarity (>330 mOsm/kg), lipemia, hypernatremia (sodium >145 mEq/L), elevated hepatocellular and cholestatic enzyme t a B l e 1 -3 9 drugs used to treat systemic hypertension 1 activities, high anion gap, and metabolic acidosis.

Clinical signs, which are referable to deficiency in glucocorticoid (cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) hormones, may develop slowly over time, leading to a waxing and waning course; acute clinical signs occur when >90% of the adrenal functional reserve has been destroyed. In such cases, complete adrenocortical collapse can result in an addisonian crisis. Lack of aldosterone causes a lack of renal sodium and water retention, and impaired potassium excretion. The most significant clinical signs associated with hypoadrenocorticism are depression, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, shaking, shivering, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, hypotension, dehydration, and inappropriate bradycardia (Box 1-48). The diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism is made based on the patient's clinical signs in combination with electrolyte abnormalities that include hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia. Serum sodium concentration (115 to 130 mEq/L) is often greatly reduced, and serum potassium is elevated (>6.0 mEq/L). A sodium:potassium ratio of <27 is characteristic of hypoadrenocorticism, although not exactly pathognomonic. Electrocardiographic changes associated with hyperkalemia include inappropriate bradycardia, absence of p waves, elevated spiked T waves, and widened QRS complexes. Other, more variable bloodwork abnormalities include a lack of a stress leukogram, eosinophilia, hypoglycemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, azotemia, and hypocholesterolemia.

Immediately perform a baseline physical examination of an animal with head trauma at the time of presentation to assess neurologic status and determine whether progressive deterioration exists (Table 1-42) . During the initial examination, note the patient's ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation). If necessary, establish an airway. Always supply supplemental oxygen to maintain Spo 2 >90%. Place an intravenous catheter and start increments of a shock dose of intravenous fluids (1/4 of 90 mL/kg for dogs: 44 mL/kg for cats). In order to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure, BP must be normalized. If other concurrent injuries are suspected (e.g., pulmonary contusions), administer synthetic colloid fluids (hydroxyethyl starch, 5 to 10 mL/kg IV) to normalize BP. Although the use of colloids is controversial because of their potential to leak into the calvarium, the benefits of reestablishing cerebral perfusion far outweigh the risks of their use. Hypertonic saline (7.5% NaCl, 3 to 5 mL/kg IV) can also be administered over 10 to 15 minutes to expand intravascular volume.

Many patients with spinal cord injury have little to no control over bladder function, which results in chronic dribbling or retention of urine and overdistension of the urinary bladder with overflow incontinence. Urinary bladder retention can lead to urinary tract infection, bladder atony, and overflow incontinence. Manual expression of the bladder several times a day may be enough to keep the bladder empty. Alternatively, place a urinary catheter to maintain patient cleanliness and to keep the bladder decompressed. (See the discussion of urinary catheterization in Section 5.) Paralytic ileus and fecal retention are frequent complications of spinal cord injury. To help prevent constipation, provide highly digestible foods and maintain the patient's hydration with oral and intravenous fluids. Mild enemas or stool softeners can also be used to treat fecal retention. To prevent decubital ulcer formation, turn the patient every 4 to 6 hours, and use clean, dry, soft padded bedding. Apply deep muscle massage and passive range of motion exercises to prevent disuse atrophy of the muscles and dependent edema.",

Pathophysiology: Ethylene glycol in itself is only minimally toxic. However, when it is metabolized to glycolate, glyoxal, glyoxylate, and oxalate, the metabolites cause an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis and precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules, renal failure, and (ultimately) death. Testing: Colorimetric tests that can be performed in most veterinary hospitals can detect larger quantities of ethylene glycol in the patient's serum. In a dog with clinical signs of ethylene glycol intoxication and renal impairment or failure, a negative result of a test for the presence of calcium oxalate crystalluria means that there is no more ethylene glycol in 1 the patient's serum because it has all been metabolized. Cats are very sensitive to the toxic effects of ethylene glycol. In many cases a cat may have ingested a toxic dose, but because the sensitivity of the assay is low, test results will be negative. Lack of treatment can result in death. Clinical Signs: There are three phases of ethylene glycol intoxication. In the first 1 to 12 hours after ingestion (stage I), the patient may appear lethargic, disoriented, and ataxic. In stage II (12 to 24 hours after ingestion), the patient improves and appears clinically normal. In stage III (24 to 72 hours after ingestion), the patient demonstrates clinical signs of renal failure (PU/PD) that progress to uremic renal failure (vomiting, lethargy, oral ulceration). Finally, seizures, coma, and death occur. Toxic Dose: The toxic dose in dogs is 6.6 mL/kg, and in cats is 1.5 mL/kg. The toxin is absorbed quite readily from the gastrointestinal tract and can be detected in the patient's serum within an hour of ingestion. Treatment: Begin treatment of known ethylene glycol ingestion immediately. Induce emesis or perform orogastric lavage and administer repeated doses of activated charcoal. Place an intravenous catheter and perform crystalloid fluid diuresis with a known antidote. The treatment of choice for dogs and cats is administration of 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), which directly inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, thus preventing the conversion of ethylene glycol to its toxic metabolites.

Pathophysiology: These mycotoxins have an unknown mechanism of action, although it is suspected to involve failure of neurotransmitter release at peripheral and CNS. A vomitogenic action of toxin on chemoreceptor trigger zone occurs. Clinical Signs: Clinical signs of intoxication include vomiting, tremors, agitation, hyperesthesia, and seizures. Testing: If tremorgenic mycotoxin toxicity is suspected, a sample of the patient's serum and gastric contents or vomitus can be submitted to the Michigan State University Veterinary Toxicology Laboratory for tremorgen assay. Toxic Dose: Small amounts are toxic, depending on the amount ingested and the size of the animal. Treatment: There is no known antidote. Perform orogastric lavage, followed by administration of activated charcoal. Repeated doses of activated charcoal are recommended, as the toxin undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Control tremors and seizures with methocarbamol (55 to 220 mg/kg IV to effect), diazepam (0.5 to 1 mg/kg IV), phenobarbital (10 to 20 mg/kg IV slowly), or pentobarbital (5 to 15 mg/kg IV to effect).

Ingestion of large amounts of paintballs can cause neurologic signs, electrolyte abnormalities, and occasionally death. Pathophysiology: When large quantities of these osmotically active sugars are ingested, osmotic shifts of fluid cause a sudden onset of neurologic or gastrointestinal signs, including ataxia, seizures, and osmotic diarrhea caused by massive fluid shifts into the gastrointestinal tract. The loss of water in excess of solute can result in hypernatremia, a free water deficit, and increased serum osmolality. Clinical Signs: Clinical signs include ataxia, seizures, and diarrhea. Treatment: After orogastric lavage, treatment of ingestion includes administering warm water enemas to help speed the movement of the paintballs through the gastrointestinal tract. Do not administer activated charcoal (usually in a propylene glycol carrier), because the compound's cathartic action will pull more fluid into the gastrointestinal tract. Baseline electrolytes should be obtained and then carefully monitored. If severe hypernatremia develops, administer hypotonic solutions such as 0.45% NaCl + 2.5% dextrose or 5% dextrose in water after calculating the patient's free water deficit. Because of the large volume of fluid loss, intravenous fluid rates may seem excessive but are necessary to normalize acid-base, electrolyte, and hydration status.

Pathophysiology: Pathophysiology involves oxygen-derived free radical species in the lungs, and eventually multiorgan failure and death. Clinical Signs: Clinical signs include initial CNS excitation, then intractable vomiting, ataxia, stupor, and coma. Seizures may be noted. Within 2 to 3 days, clinical signs associated with severe respiratory distress and ARDS can develop, leading to death. Chronic effects include pulmonary fibrosis, if the patient survives the initial toxicity period. The prognosis for paraquat toxicity is generally unfavorable. Toxic Dose: The LD 50 of paraquat is 25 to 50 mg/kg. Treatment: To treat paraquat ingestion, remove the toxin from the gastrointestinal tract as rapidly as possible after ingestion. There are no known antidotes. If the compound was ingested within the past hour and the animal is able to protect its airway, induce emesis. Otherwise, perform orogastric lavage. Activated charcoal is not as effective as clay or bentonite adsorbents for removing this particular toxin. Early in the course of paraquat toxicity, oxygen therapy is contraindicated because of the risk of producing oxygen-derived free radical species. Later, oxygen therapy, including mechanical ventilation, is necessary if ARDS develops. Experimentally, free radical scavengers (N-acetylcysteine, vitamin C, vitamin E, SAMe) have been shown to be useful in preventing damage caused by oxygenderived free radical species.

If vascular access cannot be obtained percutaneously or by cutdown methods, intraosseous catheterization should be considered. Once vascular access is achieved, rapidly administer large volumes of crystalloid or colloid fluids. As a rule of thumb, administer 1 \u20444 of a calculated shock dose of fluids-that is, 1 \u20444 \u00d7 (90 mL/kg/hr) in dogs and 1 \u20444 \u00d7 (44 mL/kg/hr) in cats-of a balanced crystalloid fluid (Normosol-R, Plasma-Lyte M, lactated Ringer's solution, or 0.9% sterile saline). Reassess the patient's perfusion parameters (heart rate, capillary refill time, BP, urine output) on a continual basis to direct further fluid therapy. Synthetic colloid fluids (hydroxyethyl starch) can also be administered in the initial resuscitation from shock. A guideline is to administer 5 to 10 mL/kg of hydroxyethyl starch as a bolus over 10 to 15 minutes and then reassess perfusion parameters. \u2020 Hypertonic saline (0.7% NaCl, 4 mL/kg) can be used in cases of hemorrhagic shock to temporarily restore intravascular fluid volume by drawing fluid from the interstitial space. Because this type of fluid resuscitation is short-lived, hypertonic saline should always be used with another crystalloid or colloid fluid, and it should not be used in patients with interstitial dehydration. If hemorrhagic shock is present, the goal should be to return a patient's BP to normal (not supraphysiologic) levels (i.e., systolic pressure 90 to 100 mm Hg, diastolic t a B l e 1 -5 6 clinical signs of shock syndrome pressure >40 mm Hg, and mean arterial pressure \u226560 mm Hg) to avoid iatrogenically causing clots to fall off and hemorrhage to start again. In critically ill patients, fluid loss can be measured in the form of urine, vomit, diarrhea, body cavity effusions, and wound exudates. In addition, insensible losses (those that cannot be readily measured from sweat, panting, and cellular metabolism) constitute 20 mL/ kg/day.

In clinical studies of small animal patients, the routine use of glucocorticosteroids and antiprostaglandins has not demonstrated definite improved survival. The risks of therapy do outweigh the anecdotal reported benefits, and therefore the empiric use of glucocorticosteroids and antiprostaglandins in any shock patient is absolutely contraindicated.

Lubricate a closedended Tomcat catheter and pass the tip into the distal urethra. Fill a 12-mL syringe with sterile saline and sterile lubricant and connect the syringe to the hub of the catheter. Pulse the fluid into the catheter as you gently move the catheter tip back and forth against the urethral obstruction. When the catheter has been passed into the urinary bladder, obtain a urine sample for urinalysis. Drain the bladder and flush with sterile saline solution until the urine efflux appears clear. Remove the Tomcat catheter and insert a 3F to 5F red rubber tube or Argyle infant feeding catheter into the urethra for urine collection and quantitation. Secure the urinary catheter to prepuce with a butterfly strip of 1-inch adhesive tape secured around the catheter and then sutured to either side of the prepuce. The catheter should be connected to a closed urinary collection system for cleanliness and to reduce the risk of ascending bacterial infection. An Elizabethan collar should be placed at all times to prevent the patient from damaging or removing the catheter.",

However, medical management consists of placement of a temporary abdominal drainage catheter into the abdomen to facilitate removal of urine from the peritoneal cavity. To place the catheter, position the patient in dorsal or lateral recumbency and shave the ventral abdomen, as for any exploratory laparotomy. Aseptically scrub the clipped area, and instill a local anesthetic (lidocaine, 1 to 2 mg/kg) caudal and to the right of the umbilicus, through the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and rectus abdominus muscles, inserting the lidocaine as you pull the needle out, thus creating an anesthetized tunnel. Aseptically scrub the area again and drape with sterile field towels; then make a small stab incision through the skin. Bluntly dissect through the subcutaneous tissue to the level of the external rectus abdominis. Pick up the muscle with a thumb forceps, and make a small stab incision into the abdominal cavity. Cut multiple holes in the side of a 14F to 16F red rubber tube or thoracic drainage catheter, using care not to make the cut wider than 50% of the circumference of the tube. Insert the catheter into the abdominal cavity in a dorsal caudal direction. Make sure that all holes in the catheter are located within the abdominal cavity. Secure the tube by placing a purse-string suture around the tube entrance site in the abdominal musculature with absorbable suture material. Close the dead space in the subcutaneous tissues with absorbable suture. Close the skin around the tube with another purse-string suture secured using a finger-trap technique. Connect the tube to a closed urinary collection system and bandage the catheter to the abdomen. The tube can remain in place until the patient's cardiorespiratory status is stabilized enough to allow anesthesia and definitive repair of the urinary tract defect.",
