Currently, pathogen identification requires culture from a sterile site (eg, blood, bone, or joint fluid); however, nearly half of all MSKIs in children remain culture-negative [1] [2] [3] . The absence of pathogen identification has important implications for the treatment of children with MSKI as the prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) often justifies broad empiric antibiotic regimens. Additionally, resistance to commonly used antistaphylococcal antibiotics continues to increase across multiple antibiotic classes and among both methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains [4] [5] [6] . Taken together, it has become increasingly difficult to select empiric antimicrobial regimens with sufficient breadth and safety.",

Briefly, nucleic acid was extracted from 275 \u00b5L of clinical sample, and 20-\u00b5L PCR reactions were prepared using 2X Platinum Multiplex Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 2.4 \u00b5L of TEM-PCR primer mix, and 4 \u00b5L of template DNA. Amplification was performed in 96-well plates on the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermocycler (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). In a single reaction, each target was amplified with nested primers and subsequently amplified with a pair of universal primers containing proprietary sequences to amplify all targets in the single reaction. The reverse universal primer was biotinylated for downstream detection. Biotinylated amplicons were detected by hybridization to a detection probe covalently coupled to a glass microarray substrate, and streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate was added. Fluorescent signal emission was measured on a SensoSpot imaging reader (Sensovation AG, Radolfzell, Germany).",

            "text": "In addition to increasing pathogen identification, TEM-PCR can rapidly provide information on antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), allowing for timely optimization of antibiotics. Clinical specimens submitted for TEM-PCR testing are batched by panel type and processed daily, and test results are reported to physicians within 7 hours of specimen receipt in the laboratory. Culture-based methods often take 24-48 hours to identify a pathogen and an additional 24-48 hours until AST is complete. This 48-96-hour delay leads to prolonged broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial exposure until AST is secured. In our study, TEM-PCR was 100% concordant with culture-based methods for methicillin and clindamycin resistance testing. The lower erythromycin resistance detection by TEM-PCR is most likely due to the limited targets selected for this assay (ermA and ermC), though this may also be a result of inadequate sensitivity of this component of the multiplex assay. The additions of ermB, msrA, msrB, and mphC gene targets would likely increase erythromycin resistance detection; however, given that erythromycin is not used in the treatment of MSKI in children, inclusion of these targets has limited clinical utility. Overall, TEM-PCR allows for rapid AST results, decreasing time to optimal therapy and increasing antimicrobial stewardship. There are several limitations to this proof-of-concept study. The limited sample size resulted in the identification of only 2 pathogen species-S. aureus and K. kingae. Although TEM-PCR has been shown to reliably detect numerous bacterial and viral species in other infectious diseases [11] [12] [13] , the sensitivity in pediatric MSKI remains unknown. Additionally, despite the strong concordance with culture-based methods, the small sample size limits the power of the study. Despite these limitations, the high sensitivity and negative predictive values seen in this small pilot study suggest that TEM-PCR, as a rapid diagnostic tool, can play an important role in the initial evaluation of children with MSKI.",

Recent studies have investigated the utility of K. kingae-specific PCR in children with MSKI, as well as broad-range PCR for prosthetic joint infections [8, 14] . Few studies, however, have described the utility of a flexible, well-developed platform in detecting the common pathogens of pediatric MSKI. TEM-PCR provides rapid results with high sensitivity utilizing a multiplex panel that targets likely pathogens and known antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and further investigation of this technology is warranted.",
