Ontologically, pDCs differentiate from both myeloid and lymphoid precursors but display lymphoid features regardless of their developmental path (Corcoran et al., 2003; Naik et al., 2007; Onai et al., 2007; Sathe et al., 2013; Shigematsu et al., 2004) . Functionally, while cDC1s and cDC2s are specialized for interaction with T cells, pDCs are well known for their innate capacity to rapidly produce large quantities of type I interferon (IFNa and IFNb, abbreviated IFN-I) upon viral encounter (Asselin-Paturel et al., 2001; Siegal et al., 1999) .",

However, there has been a general lack of consensus on these populations. Previous descriptions of pDC subpopulations were limited by inherently biased flow cytometry analyses with few markers. Furthermore, these reports fail to resolve findings between species. Advances in single-cell omics technologies have yielded an unprecedented resolution of the human DC compartment. Using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches that leverage unbiased analyses, we and others have unveiled a human pDC-like population with select features of cDCs (Alc\u00e1 ntara- Hern\u00e1 ndez et al., 2017; See et al., 2017; Villani et al., 2017) .

We found a pDC-like population in mouse that displays cDC features and functions but ultimately demonstrates close developmental relationship to pDCs. We performed parallel cross-species comparisons with the goal of aligning this pDC subpopulation in mouse and human, which is imperative for the translation of basic biology to human immunology. We found that this murine pDC-like population is equivalent to the recently described human AXL + DCs (also known as ASDCs) (Alc\u00e1 ntara-Hern\u00e1 ndez et al., 2017; See et al., 2017; Villani et al., 2017) . Although in mouse these cells did not express the protein Axl, they did share a continuum of phenotypes that span pDCs and cDC2s. We herein propose to name this intermediate population transitional DCs (tDCs) in both species. Our high-dimensional analysis represents an easily accessible data resource on the phenotype, transcriptome, and function of pDCs and tDCs at steady state and during influenza infection. This dataset reveals information that has not been recognized using low-dimensional flow cytometry analyses and can be exploited for the development of pDC-and tDC-based therapeutics.",

In addition to surface markers, this panel incorporated transcription factors (TFs) differentially expressed in DC subsets: Tcf4 (pDCs), Irf8 (pDCs and cDC1s), and Irf4 (cDC2s) (Cisse et al., 2008; Schiavoni et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2004) . To allow greater resolution of minor myeloid populations, we enriched mouse splenic DCs and plotted Lin \u00c0 cells in a t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) map (Figure 1A) . We found a minimal number of Ccr2 + monocytes and CD64 + red pulp macrophages (RPMs) after enrichment (Figure S1) . Based on their phenotype, we identified formally described DC subsets, i.e., pDCs, cDC1s, and cDC2s. As expected, we observed high Tcf4 expression in pDCs, but not in cDCs, and high Irf8 expression in cDC1s and pDCs, but not in cDC2s. Surprisingly, we observed a bridging population of cells localized between pDCs and cDC2s in the tSNE map. The phenotype of this bridging population ranged from pDC-to cDC2-like, i.e., high to low expression of Tcf4, Irf8, and the pDC marker SiglecH and low to high expression of CD11c.",

To evaluate DC populations' homology between species, we performed parallel CyTOF analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ( Figure 1B ). In line with our previous report, we observed that human AXL + DCs bridge pDCs and cDC2s in a tSNE map, reflecting an intermediate phenotype, which was also true for human spleen ( Figure S2 ). Similar to mouse, the human bridging population expressed high to low levels of TCF4, IRF8, and the pDC markers CD123 and BDCA2, while CD11c expression ranged from low to high. Thus, the presence of cells that display a transitional phenotype between pDCs and cDC2s is a conserved characteristic between mouse and human. We called these cells transitional DCs (tDCs) with the intent to emphasize not only their intermediate phenotype but also their continuum of pDC to cDC2 features.",

We designed a flow cytometry gating strategy to enable tDC characterization, quantification, and purification ( Figure S3 ). Because tDCs did not express the cDC1 marker Xcr1 or the cDC2/monocyte marker CD11b (Figure 1A) , we used these parameters to eliminate these cells (Figure 2A) . Biaxial gating of CyTOF data showed that tDCs (black dots) were among cells expressing high to low levels of SiglecH and low to high levels of CD11c. Furthermore, as shown by tSNE and UMAP analysis, tDCs, but not pDCs, were Cx3cr1 high (Figures 1D and 2A, upper left) . Finally, we observed that tDCs could be separated into two populations representing different parts of the spectrum: CD11c low Ly6C high tDCs (ii, purple) represent cells that are more similar to pDCs, while CD11c high Ly6C low tDCs (iii, cyan) correspond to cells that are more similar to cDC2s (Figure 2A , lower left). This partition mirrored our previous analysis of human AXL + DCs, which can also be split based on expression of CD11c to facilitate characterization of their heterogeneity (Alc\u00e1 ntara-Hern\u00e1 ndez et al., 2017). We validated our observations by flow cytometry and quantified tDCs in lymphoid organs (Figures 2A and 2B; see Figure S3 for the complete gating strategy). Compared with other DC subsets, tDCs were a minor population of cells in spleen and lymph nodes (LNs), representing $0.02%-0.07% of all leukocytes. Notably, tSNE analysis revealed that LN tDCs mapped between pDCs and cDC2s and away from migratory major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) high DCs ( Figures 2C and S3C) .",

The mouse dataset included noncanonical DCs, which we used to represent mouse tDCs for this analysis. PCA using nearly 1,000 differentially expressed genes overlapped mouse and human pDCs, cDC2s, and cDC1s, validating our analysis ( Figure 3A ; see Figure S4A for analysis details). Mouse tDCs localized between pDCs and cDC2s, overlapping with human tDCs. In both species, tDCs shared intermediate expression of several pDC genes (e.g., ITM2C and PTPRS), cDC genes (e.g., CD33 and ITGAX), CX3CR1, and CD5 ( Figure 3B ).",

To mirror our mouse tDC analysis and characterize diversity within the population, we divided human tDCs based on their expression of CD11c, as previously described (Alc\u00e1 ntara-Hern\u00e1 ndez et al., 2017). Human tDCs display high levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL; however, Axl was undetectable in mouse tDCs using two antibody clones that efficiently labeled macrophages, as shown in Figure S4B . Human tDCs expressed CD5 and CD81 (Zhang et al., 2017) , which was also true for mouse tDCs, espe-cially CD11c high tDCs. Lastly, both CD2 and SIGLEC1/CD169, two markers that have been used to define human pDC subpopulations (Matsui et al., 2009; Wilhelm et al., 2016) , were enriched in tDCs compared with other DC subsets in both species. However, CD2 was not a unique marker for tDCs, and Siglec1 was only detected in a fraction ($20%-30%) of murine tDCs. We were not able to evaluate SIGLEC6, a marker of human tDCs, because it does not have a mouse homolog. Collectively, mouse and human tDCs overlap transcriptionally and phenotypically. Furthermore, many previous reports referring to pDC subpopulations can be explained by the heterogeneous phenotype of tDCs in both mouse and human.",

At the RNA and protein level, both TCF4 and IRF8 expression ranged from intermediate to low in CD11c low and CD11c high tDCs, respectively. We found high levels of IRF4 in tDCs, particularly CD11c high tDCs; however, different from mouse, IRF4 was also present in human pDCs.

In mouse, Id2 was not detected in pDCs and CD11c low tDCs but was noted in CD11c high tDCs at levels comparable to cDCs. Similarly, low ID2 expression was detected in human CD11c high tDCs. Finally, we evaluated IRF7, a TF associated with the capacity of pDCs to produce IFN-I (Honda et al., 2005; Izaguirre et al., 2003) . We found that unlike pDCs, all tDCs in mouse and human expressed negligible levels of IRF7, suggesting functional differences between these cells. In summary, tDCs demonstrate a mixed pattern of TFs, correlating with their transitional phenotype between pDCs and cDCs.",

Depletion of Irf8 from pDCs generates a population with some features of cDCs, i.e., lower levels of SiglecH and higher levels of CD11c, Irf4, and MHC class II, which resembles the tDC population described here. Therefore, we analyzed pDCs and tDCs in CD11c CRE Irf8 fl/fl (Irf8 CKO ) mice by CyTOF. As expected, cDC1s failed to develop in these mice ( Figures 4F and 4G ). On the contrary, pDC and tDC numbers were unaffected in Irf8 CKO mice. Most pDCs from Irf8 CKO mice clustered separately from control mice but did not overlap with tDCs (population B in Irf8 CKO versus population A in control mice). Indeed, pDCs from Irf8 CKO mice had decreased expression of several markers, including SiglecH, and increased expression of MHC class II, as previously shown ( Figure 4H ; Sichien et al., 2016) . Similarly, tDC phenotype was slightly altered in Irf8 CKO mice, although to a lower extent, corresponding to their lower expression of Irf8. We conclude that similar to pDCs, Irf8 is not required for tDC development.",

We confirmed this analysis by evaluating the expression of these TFs within mouse CD11c low and CD11c high tDCs (Figure 5A) . We detected high levels of Bcl11a, Runx2, and SpiB in pDCs and tDCs but little to none of these TFs in cDC1s or cDC2s. Bcl11a was expressed similarly by all tDCs and pDCs, whereas Runx2 expression varied from high to low in tDC fractions. SpiB expression was higher in tDCs than in cDCs, but lower than in pDCs. These results show that tDCs share multiple transcriptional regulators with pDCs.",

However, different from cDCs, tDCs harbor lymphoid characteristics and require Tcf4 for their development, which is inconsistent with these cells being pre-DCs. To further analyze the relationship between tDCs and pre-DCs, we performed CyTOF profiling and unbiased analysis. We were unable to identify tDCs in the bone marrow (BM); thus, we first compared splenic tDCs with BM pre-DCs. We found that splenic tDCs did not overlap with BM pre-DCs in a tSNE map, indicating that they are phenotypically distinct ( Figure S5 ). Next, we analyzed the relationship between splenic tDCs and splenic pre-DCs, gated as Lin \u00c0 CD11c high MHC class II \u00c0 CD172a \u00c0 CD135 + ( Figure 5D ; Liu et al., 2009) . Unbiased analysis revealed that splenic pre-DCs were heterogeneous and localized to various CD135 high areas of the tSNE map. Most pre-DCs mapped near cDC1s, and only a fraction of pre-DCs mapped with Cx3cr1 + tDCs in the tSNE map ( Figure 5D ). Furthermore, splenic pre-DCs were considerably less numerous than tDCs, and only 10% were encompassed within the total tDC population ( Figures  5E and 5F ). Closer phenotypic analysis revealed that $60% of pre-DCs expressed either Xcr1 or CD11b, markers that tDCs lack ( Figures 1A and 5G ). In addition, only $40% of pre-DCs expressed Cx3cr1, which is expressed by all tDCs. Conversely, tDCs expressed variable levels of B220, MHC class II, and CD172a, which are excluded from the pre-DC definition. Finally, splenic tDCs express SiglecH, while splenic pre-DCs are mostly SiglecH \u00c0 , as previously described (Figures 1A and 5D; Schlitzer et al., 2015) . Thus, our unbiased analysis revealed that there is minimal overlap between splenic tDCs and pre-DCs.",

In contrast, both cDC2s and cDC1s strongly upregulated MHC class II and CD86, but not CD69. In accordance with their transitional phenotype, the CD11c low tDC fraction upregulated CD69 at comparable levels to pDCs, whereas the CD11c high fraction upregulated MHC class II and CD86 similar to cDCs. Human DC subsets behaved similarly when stimulated ex vivo with CpG-A; i.e., HLA-DR and CD86 were less upregulated in pDCs and scaled up from tDCs to cDCs ( Figure 6B ).

Similarly, human CD11c low tDCs, but not CD11c high tDCs, secreted very low levels of IFNa ( Figure 6D ). We also evaluated tDC capacity to produce interleukin-12 (IL-12), a T H 1-activating cytokine suggested to be secreted by human tDCs (See et al., 2017; Villani et al., 2017) . We found that mouse tDCs were unable to secrete the active form IL-12p70 following stimulation with CpG-A or CpG-B, whereas all mouse DC subsets secreted low levels of this cytokine in response to imiquimod. However, we did detect the precursor subunit IL-12p40 in tDCs and cDCs following CpG-A stimulation ( Figure 6C ). We observed similar results in human; i.e., in our hands, pDCs and tDCs did not secrete IL-12p70 with either stimulation tested ( Figure 6D ).

Altogether, these results indicate that tDCs' functional capabilities vary across the population, with CD11c low cells behaving more like pDCs and CD11c high cells behaving more like cDCs. These transitional functions of tDCs were similar in mouse and human, cementing their homology.",

Different from cDCs that migrate from the lung to local draining mediastinal LNs, pDCs are known to accumulate in the infected lung (Grayson et al., 2007; Helft et al., 2012) . Given their developmental similarities with pDCs, we hypothesized that tDCs will demonstrate similar behavior and accumulate in the lung during infection. B6 mice were infected intranasally with influenza (Flu PR8), and the course of infection was tracked by animal weight loss ( Figure 7B ). Before infection, cDC2s and cDC1s were represented in higher numbers than pDCs and tDCs in the lung. However, shortly after infection, lung cDC2 and cDC1 numbers decreased dramatically, whereas pDC and tDC numbers increased 2-to 3-fold (Figures 7C and 7D; see Figure S7C for the gating strategy). By days 4-6, pDCs and tDCs occupied more than 50% of the DC compartment. The loss of cDC1s and cDC2s in the lung corresponded to an increase in migratory cDCs in the lung-draining mediastinal LNs, with a peak at day 4 ( Figure 7D ). We did not observe accumulation of tDCs in mediastinal LNs, suggesting that these cells were not following the same migratory pattern as cDCs. Finally, we observed that both lung tDCs and pDCs upregulated the activation markers CD69, MHC class II, and CD86 ( Figure 7E ). We conclude that similar to pDCs, tDCs are recruited to the site of influenza infection and display an activated phenotype.",

We found that diphtheria toxin (DT) administration in CLEC4C DTR mice eliminated pDCs, but not tDCs, in the spleen and lung ( Figure 7F ). Furthermore, we did not find depletion of any other DC subset in this model, as previously described (data not shown; Swiecki et al., 2010) .

We found that mouse tDCs are best distinguished from pDCs by expression of Cx3cr1, a marker also expressed by human tDCs. A lack of concordance in DC subset-specific surface markers between human and mouse is well documented for other DC subsets (Vu Manh et al., 2015) . For example, Pdca1 (BST2) is a pDC-specific marker in mouse at steady state but is widely expressed in human immune cells (Blasius et al., 2006) . These differences may reflect divergent evolution, perhaps driven by species-specific pathogens. Because of these differences, it is imperative to consider a combination of phenotypic, functional, and transcriptional assays to establish cell-type homology between species, as we have done here. We found that mouse and human tDCs did share variable expression of CD2, CD5, CD81, and SIGLEC1. Despite these similarities, we could not identify any marker that unequivocally distinguished mouse tDCs from pDCs and cDCs, which is in accordance with their transitional phenotype. These results suggest that tDCs were probably overlooked when using gating strategies based on a few markers and illustrate the importance of using high-dimensional approaches to avoid oversimplification of the DC compartment. As shown here, high-dimensional approaches can be used to design simplified gating strategies for flow cytometry analysis and cell purification.",

First, tDCs expressed the pDC lineage-defining TF TCF4. This TF is necessary for the development of both mouse and human pDCs and mouse tDCs, as demonstrated here (Cisse et al., 2008; Grajkowska et al., 2017; Nagasawa et al., 2008) . The developmental dependence of tDCs on Tcf4 is in accordance with a lack of noncanonical DCs in Tcf4 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Bar-On et al., 2010), cells that we show are included within the broader definition of tDCs. In addition, pDCs and tDCs shared expression of other TFs required for pDC development and function (e.g., BCL11A, IRF8, SPIB, and RUNX2), which are known to be upstream or downstream of the master regulator TCF4 (Ceribelli et al., 2016; Ghosh et al., 2010; Sawai et al., 2013) . Similar to pDCs, tDCs do not require IRF8 for their development, which is in contrast to cDC1s (Schiavoni et al., 2002; Sichien et al., 2016) . Altogether, the shared TF signature of pDCs and tDCs strongly indicates that their development likely progresses along a shared path.",

            "text": "Another observation that associates tDCs with pDCs is the presence of lymphoid characteristics: rearrangement of the IgH locus, which is a permanent change to the genomic DNA, and expression of PTCRA-EGFP. The presence of these features in pDCs was originally interpreted to be indicative of lymphoid origin. Indeed, analysis at the single-cell level has identified a lymphoid precursor that can give rise to pDCs (Dress et al., 2019; Rodrigues et al., 2018) . However, care should be taken when analyzing pDC lymphoid features, because these are also known to be carried by pDCs derived from myeloid progenitors ( ). Regardless of their lymphoid or myeloid origin, IgH rearrangement can be detected in pDCs and tDCs, which suggests that these cells are closely related developmentally. Similar developmental associations can be implied by the expression of PTCRA-EGFP in pDCs and tDCs. These lymphoid characteristics may result from their shared expression of Bcl11a, which controls RAG-1 expression (Lee et al., 2017) . Alternatively, they may be a consequence of an ectopic lymphoid program activated by TCF4, as previously suggested (Reizis, 2019) . We found that tDCs, especially CD11c high tDCs, simultaneously express PTCRA-EGFP and Zbtb46, a TF generally associated with cDCs. Zbtb46 expression has also been found in embryonicderived Langerhans cells (Wu et al., 2016) , suggesting that this TF does not necessarily label a pre-DC developmental pathway but perhaps reveals the functional capabilities of the cells, as suggested (Meredith et al., 2012b) .",

This pDC conversion, also called plasticity, has been observed for both human and mouse pDCs (Alc\u00e1 ntara-Hern\u00e1 ndez et al., 2017; Alculumbre et al., 2018; Grouard et al., 1997; Liou et al., 2008; Manh et al., 2013) .

Using a high-dimensional alignment strategy at the protein level, we show that mouse tDCs have little to no overlap with splenic and BM pre-DCs. Furthermore, splenic tDCs express SiglecH, and SiglecH CRE RFP fl/fl reporter mice have limited ($0.5%) RFP labeling in cDCs (Puttur et al., 2013) . Similarly, DT administration to SiglecH DTR/DTR mice does not result in cDC depletion (Takagi et al., 2011) . Altogether, these observations support our conclusion that tDCs are a different population of cells distinct from pre-DCs. Future work will aim to trace tDC fate in health and infection.",

However, similar to pDCs, tDCs accumulate in the lung during infection, suggesting that these two cell types may have cooperative roles during anti-viral responses. Our in vitro data show that complementary IFN-I secretion and antigen presentation functions are enacted by pDCs and tDCs, respectively. Surprisingly, we found that tDCs are present in DT-treated CLEC4C DTR mice, which allowed us to assess their role in the absence of pDCs. We found that a lack of pDCs, but not tDCs, promotes an increase in the frequency of Treg cells during influenza infection. This observation suggests that tDCs may be suited to promote Treg cells in accordance with their superior antigen presentation capabilities. However, the role of pDCs during influenza infection appears to be pro-inflammatory. It remains to be determined why tDCs are not depleted in the CLEC4C DTR mice given that DTR expression is thought to be modulated by TCF4 in this model (Cisse et al., 2008; Swiecki et al., 2010) . Nevertheless, this finding points to the need to dissect whether tDCs are affected in other mouse models that have been used to evaluate pDC function. It is conceivable that tDCs, similar to pDCs, would be depleted when using anti-BST2 antibodies or SiglecH DTR models. Finally, to unequivocally identify the role of tDCs during immune responses, it is necessary to develop strategies to specifically deplete these cells without affecting pDCs or cDCs.",
