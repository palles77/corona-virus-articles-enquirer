These recommended practices are intended to provide guidance for various practice settings, including traditional ORs, ambulatory surgery units, physicians' offices, cardiac catheterization suites, endoscopy suites, radiology departments, and all other areas where operative and other invasive procedures may be performed. PURPOSE. Anesthesia equipment is a potential vector in the transmission of microorganisms. Proper handling and processing of medications, supplies, and equipment can reduce the risk of infection to the patient. These recommended practices provide guidelines for the handling, cleaning, disposal, and reprocessing of anesthesia equipment and instrumentation. Medications should be stored in a clean area. Personnel should perform basic hand hygiene according to the CDC's \"Guideline for hand hygiene in health-care settings,\"'\" before preparing medication. Vial stoppers should be cleaned with alcohol before they are punctured. Single-dose vials should be used for only one patient. Syringes of unused medication should be discarded at the end of the procedure. Propofol should be withdrawn immediately before administration.",
