Most BTS therefore strive to recruit a donor base of such voluntary donors as they provide the lowest level of risk. Conversely the use of family replacement and paid donors may result in increased risk of infection and does not encourage regular donation. Although the basis of the donor supply in a number of countries, is not a situation to be encouraged (World Health Organization, 2012).",

Although part of this process is to identify risks to the donors themselves, a major part is to identify any specific factors that may indicate that the donor has a higher risk of carrying an infection that may then be transmitted through blood transfusion. The safety of blood donations may thus be affected by donors' risk of exposure to HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis and other TTIs via a number of different routes. These primarily include infection early in life, antenatal, perinatal, and other close contact, sexual contact, and percutaneous exposure through high-risk sexual behaviors, and unsafe blood transfusion and injection practices, cosmetic treatments and rituals. Current or previous country of residence, and travel history also need to be considered as there are a number of transmissible agents that are restricted geographically and therefore are not a threat in every donor/donation. Donors with such identified risks are deferred from donating, either temporarily or permanently depending on their particular risk(s). Although the laboratory screening of donations for evidence of infectious diseases is the process that actually determines whether donations are released for use, donor selection is an essential part of the overall screening process as it identifies and defers 'unsuitable donors' before a donation is collected, thus making a significant contribution to ensuring the safety of those donations that are collected.",

In countries with developed health care systems, screening is largely automated using highly sensitive and specific assays performed within highly controlled systems.

However, many transfusion services follow a strategy that requires any screen reactive donation (initial reactive) to be retested (often in duplicate) using the same assay. If still reactive (repeat reactive) the donation is considered to be unsuitable for use and discarded, but if negative on repeat testing the donation is considered to be screen negative and released for clinical use.

Screening for additional markers for these infections and for other transfusion-transmissible infectious agents could then be considered, depending on the residual risk, logistics, and level of resources available.WHO recommends that, at a minimum, screening of all blood donations should be mandatory for the following infections and using the following markers: l HIV-1 and HIV-2: screening for either a combination of HIV antigen-antibody or HIV antibodies. l Hepatitis B: screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). l Hepatitis C: screening for either a combination of HCV antigen-antibody or HCV antibodies. l Treponema pallidum (syphilis): screening for specific treponemal antibodies.The outcomes of the laboratory screening of blood donations remain the final decision point in the release of blood components for clinical use; however, even with the high quality assays and systems now available, the screening process cannot be considered to be totally effective because: l An infection in donated blood may not be detected due to the collection of the donation during the window period of infection or failure due to assay sensitivity or error. l A donor may be infected with an infectious agent for which donations are not routinely screened. l There are some emerging infections for which screening may not be not available or effective (Alter et al., 2007; Alter, 2004; Busch and Kleinman, 2003) .",

Each country should assess whether any blood-borne infections in addition to HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis also pose a significant threat to the safety of the blood supply owing to their biology, incidence, and/or prevalence in the general population and the subsequent risk of the presence of this infection in blood donors:l In endemic areas, specific risks include the transmission of malaria (Kitchen and Chiodini, 2006) and Chagas disease and HTLV. l In nonendemic areas, specific risks are posed by the donation of blood by individuals who have lived in or visited areas that are endemic for malaria, Chagas disease, or HTLV. l Specific recipient groups are at risk from the transmission of certain infections, such as human cytomegalovirus.Reliable epidemiological data are needed to assess the specific risks of transmission by transfusion and of resultant disease. Screening for other TTIs should be considered when there is clear evidence that the safety of the blood supply would be significantly compromised without their inclusion in the screening program. It should not be implemented until systems are already in place to ensure that all donations are screened for the four major blood-borne infections in a quality-assured manner.",

Screening should be performed using highly sensitive and specific assays that have been specifically evaluated and validated for blood screening. 5. Quality-assured screening of all donations using serology should be in place before additional technologies such as nucleic acid testing are considered. 6. Only blood and blood components from donations that are nonreactive in all screening tests for all markers should be released for clinical or manufacturing use. 7. All screen reactive units should be clearly marked, removed from the quarantined stock, and stored separately and securely until they are disposed of safely or kept for quality assurance or research purposes, in accordance with national policies. 8. Confirmatory testing of screen reactive donations should be undertaken for donor notification, counseling, and referral for treatment, deferral or recall for future donation, and look-back on previous donations.",
