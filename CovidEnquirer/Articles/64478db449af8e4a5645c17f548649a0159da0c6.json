Predicting 28 long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We 29 used individual-based modelling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and 30 transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian 31 devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed Approximate Bayesian 32 Computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and 33 demographic system properties derived from ten years of data after disease emergence, 34 enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population 35 declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics. Only 21% of 36 matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 years following devil facial tumour 37 disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57% of simulations. In the 38 remaining 22% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 years, usually with 39 long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host-pathogen 40 coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial 41 management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-42 term outcome of devil-DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that 43 immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of 44",

Following 57 the initial epidemic and transient dynamic behaviour, long-term outcomes include pathogen 58 fadeout, host extinction, or long-term endemicity with varying impacts on the host population 59 size (Hastings 2004, Benton et al. 2006, Cazelles and Hales 2006). Predicting which of these 60 long-term outcomes may occur on the basis of initial transient dynamics is very challenging 61 and conclusions about possible disease effects on population viability based on early 62 epidemic dynamics can be misleading. 63 Nevertheless, predicting the long-term consequences of an infectious disease as early 64 as possible in the emergence process is important for management. If the disease has a high 65 likelihood of ultimately leading to host extinction, then strategies such as stamping out 66 infection by removing all potentially infectious individuals may be justifiable, despite short-67 term impacts on the host species and ethical considerations (McCallum and Hocking 2005).",

No Tasmanian devil population has yet become extinctand 305 populations persist, albeit in low numbers, where disease has been present the longest (e.g., at 306 wukalina/Mount William National Park and at Freycinet, where DFTD emerged, 307 respectively, at least 21 and 17 years ago) (Epstein et al. 2016). Also, a considerable decline 308 in DFTD prevalence has been observed in recent years at Freycinet (Sebastien Comte, 309 unpublished data). These study sites did not contribute to the fitting of our model and at least 310 to some extent constitute an independent validation and test of the model predictions. Our 311 modelling results suggest that observed population dynamics of devils and DFTD do not 312 require evolutionary changes, although there is evidence of rapid evolution in disease-313 burdened devil populations (Epstein et al. 2016) similar to rapid evolution in other vertebrates 314 when subjected to intense selection pressure (Christie et al. 2016, Campbell-Staton et al. 315 2017). 316 One of the differences between earlier models and those we present here is the 317 inclusion of tumour growth, with mortality and transmission rates that depend on individual 318 disease burden. Inclusion of burden-dependent dynamics results in additional and 319 qualitatively different time delays than those incorporated in previous models. Tumours take 320 time to grow before they have a major impact on host survival and become highly infectious 321 (Hamede et al. 2017, Wells et al. 2017). This slows the spread of DFTD and its impact on 322 devil population fluctuations. It also means that parameters estimated from field data, without McCallum et al. 2009). Our models suggest that documented dramatic population declines 325 during the first 10 years or so of the DFTD epizootic may represent just the first peak of a 326 classical epidemic (Bailey 1975). Long-term predictions from our models suggest, however, 327 that DFTD is a slow burning disease with population changes governed by long-term 328 oscillations. 329 It is well known, both from simple Lotka-Volterra models and from a range of 330 empirical studies, that consumer-resource interactions have a propensity to cycle, driven by 331 the time delays inherent in these systems (Murdoch et al. 2003). Disease burden-dependent 332 demographic and epidemiological parameters, together with burden growth within the host, 333 add additional time delays, both lengthening any oscillations and increasing the likelihood 334 that they will be maintained in the longer term. Apparently, such time-delays increase the 335 probability of host-pathogen coexistence, similar to predator-prey dynamics, rather than host 336 or pathogen extirpation. Grounded in theory and a reasonable body of modelling studies of 337 other wildlife diseases, disease-induced population extinction appears to be more generally an 338 exception rather than the rule, unless host populations are very small, or unless there are 339 reservoir species that are tolerant of infection (de Castro and Bolker 2005).",

A fundamental 346 problem in applying modelling approaches to forecast the outcome of emerging infectious 347 disease epidemics is the need to estimate parameter values based on empirical data derived relatively early stages of an epizootic, in the absence of retrospective knowledge 349 (Heesterbeek et al. 2015, Ferguson et al. 2016). Examples include estimating R0 for SARS 350 (Lipsitch et al. 2003) and for the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa (Whitty et al. 351 2014, WHO Ebola Response Team 2014) among others (LaDeau et al. 2011). In most of 352 these cases, the objective is to estimate parameters associated with the growth phase of the 353 epidemic to assess the effectiveness of interventions such as vaccination. The task we have 354 addressed in this paper is even more challengingseeking to predict the long-term endemic 355 behaviour of a pathogen that is currently still in the early stages of emergence. We suggest 356 that management efforts to maintain devil populations in the face of DFTD should be guided 357 by our changing understanding of the long-term dynamics of the DFTD epidemic. 358 Management efforts in wild populations that solely aim to combat the impact of DFTD can 359 be counterproductive if they disrupt long-term eco-evolutionary dynamics that may 360 eventually lead to endemicity with stable devil populations. Our ability to predict future 361 outcomes in the absence of management actions require some caution as we cannot fully 362 exclude the possibility that DFTD can cause local population extinctions once populations are 363 small, warranting future research. While our findings emphasize the importance of 364 accounting for individual tumour load for accurate prediction and epidemiological modelling 365 of DFTD dynamics, our inability to uncover the exact role of devil spatial proximity on 366 disease transmission means that further research is necessary to understand relevant factors in 367 disease spread.",
