Physical examination showed a body temperature of 38\u00b0C, blood pressure of 115/70 mm Hg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 24 per minute. the jugular venous pressure was elevated, as assessed clinically. the novel Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MeRS-CoV) has been identified as a cause of pneumonia; however, it has not been reported as a cause of acute myocarditis. A 60-year-old man presented with pneumonia and congestive heart failure. On the first day of admission, he was found to have an elevated troponin-i level and severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiography. the serum creatinine level was found mildly elevated. Chest radiography revealed in the lower lung fields accentuated bronchovascular lung markings and multiple small patchy opacities. Laboratory tests were negative for viruses known to cause myocarditis. Sputum sample was positive for MeRS-CoV. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance revealed evidence of acute myocarditis. the patient had all criteria specified by the international Consensus Group on CMR in Myocarditis that make a clinical suspicion for acute myocarditis. this was the first case that demonstrated that MeRS-CoV may cause acute myocarditis and acute-onset heart failure. his chest revealed widespread crackles.",

In this case, the distribution of LGE in the sub-epicardial region is consistent with myocarditis. Myocardial injury due to myocarditis can be easily differentiated from an ischemic injury, as the latter results in sub-endocardial involvement on LGe images. 8 LGe is generally absent in stress-induced cardiomyopathy. 12 t2w-StiR imaging is used to detect tissue edema, which indicates acuteness of the myocardial injury. 8, 9 When both criteria, i.e.,",

However, in the setting of clinically suspected myocarditis, 2 criteria are required to diagnose acute myocarditis according to the international Consensus Group on CMR in Myocarditis (Lake Louise Consensus Criteria). 8 no improvement in LV systolic function was observed on echocardiography performed 3 months after the first one.
