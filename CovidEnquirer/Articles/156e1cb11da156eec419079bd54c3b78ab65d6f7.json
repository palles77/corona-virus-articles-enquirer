On May 14, the World Health Organization (WHO) took Toronto off the list as a SARS-affected area in the absence of newly reported cases for at least 2 incubation periods after the last SARS case-patient was isolated. In accordance with public health principles, the enhanced measures were selectively relaxed in low-risk settings in Toronto area hospitals in early May 2003, although full precautions were still recommended for patients with febrile respiratory illnesses. In the third week of May, a cluster of febrile respiratory illness at a Toronto area rehabilitation hospital was reported to the health department. Traceback of these SARS cases identified the index patient as a postoperative patient who was transferred from hospital X to the rehabilitation hospital. This link uncovered clusters of unrecognized SARS infections on a surgical ward and a psychiatry ward at hospital X. Investigation determined that the ventilation system did not contribute to the spread of SARS at that hospital. On May 23, 2003, hospital X was closed to nonobstetric admissions other than newly identified SARS cases, and SARS precautions were reintroduced. As part of an outbreak investigation, we explored potential factors contributing to the late recognition of SARS infections in a cohort of persons with SARS admitted to hospital X.",

For patients admitted before that date (N = 20), the relative risk for late recognition of SARS for postoperative patients was 2.7 (95% confidence interval 0.99-7.2, p = 0.07) and was just short of statistical significance (data not shown). Once SARS transmission was recognized at hospital X and enhanced infection control precautions were reinstituted, clinicians were more likely to suspect SARS, and nosocomial transmission was ended abruptly.",

The patients had no known contact with other SARS patients, did not have a travel history to SARS-affected areas outside of Canada when the outbreak was thought to be over in Toronto, and were unaware of a simmering outbreak associated with hospital X. Perhaps because of the nonspecific nature of clinical manifestations, SARS can be especially difficult to recognize among patients already hospitalized for other reasons. These symptoms overlap many of the symptoms of hospitalized febrile postoperative patients and patients with other respiratory illnesses (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . In addition, at the time of this nosocomial outbreak, the full spectrum of the clinical signs and symptoms of SARS had not yet been well characterized (11) .",

Studies that include hospital workers and persons admitted to other hospitals are needed. Seroprevalence studies will be helpful because some infected persons may not be symptomatic. The small sample size limited the power to detect small differences and precluded multivariate analysis. A small number of patients with a diagnosis of SARS may not actually have been infected with SARS-CoV. This possibility could have biased the results either way. However, this number is likely small because most case-patients tested positive for SARS-CoV.",

This recommendation is particularly important if the hospital housed SARS patients within the previous 20 days or if unexplained febrile respiratory clusters had been noticed within the institution.",

A sensitive infectious disease surveillance system operated by the infection control officer must be in place in healthcare facilities for early detection and implementation of appropriate measures to interrupt transmission (13, 14) . This surveillance should include the monitoring of increased absenteeism among healthcare workers; unusual fever or pneumonia clusters among patients, family, visitors, and healthcare workers; pneumonia deaths; and laboratory testing for respiratory pathogens or SARS-CoV. These steps require commitment, preparedness planning, resources, and training. The lack of a rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic test for early SARS infection hampers the ability of clinicians to make a prompt diagnosis in cases when an epidemiologic link is missing (15) .",
