However, some viruses are inherently refractory to cloning in high-copy-number plasmids due to toxicity of viral sequences to E. coli. We report a strategy that is a compromise between infectivity of the RNA transcripts and toxicity to E. coli effected by introducing frameshift mutations into \"slippery sequences\" near the viral \"toxicity sequences\" in the viral cDNA. Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) has cDNA sequences that are toxic to E. coli. The original full-length infectious cDNA of CTV and a derivative replicon, CTV-\u232cCla, cloned into pUC119, resulted in unusually limited E. coli growth. However, upon sequencing of these cDNAs, an additional uridinylate (U) was found in a stretch of U's between nts 3726 and 3731 that resulted in a change to a reading frame with a stop codon at nt 3734. Yet, in vitro produced RNA transcripts from these clones infected protoplasts, and the resulting progeny virus was repaired. Correction of the frameshift mutation in the CTV cDNA constructs resulted in increased infectivity of in vitro produced RNA transcripts, but also caused a substantial increase of toxicity to E. coli, now requiring 3 days to develop visible colonies. Frameshift mutations created in sequences not suspected to facilitate reading frame shifting and silent mutations introduced into oligo(U) regions resulted in complete loss of infectivity, suggesting that the oligo(U) region facilitated the repair of the frameshift mutation. Additional frameshift mutations introduced into other oligo(U) regions also resulted in transcripts with reduced infectivity similarly to the original clones with the \u03e91 insertion. However, only the frameshift mutations introduced into oligo(U) regions that were near and before the toxicity region improved growth and stability in E. coli. These data demonstrate that, when hosts are sufficiently susceptible for infection by transcripts of reduced specific infectivity, introduction of frameshift mutations at \"slippery sequences\" near toxic regions of viral cDNAs can be used as an additional strategy to clone recalcitrant viral sequences in high-copy-number plasmids for reverse genetics.",

The first successful attempts initiated infection of cells by inoculation with bacterial plasmids containing the viral cDNA inserts (Taniguchi et al., 1978; Racanicllo and Baltimore, 1981) . However, production of in vitro RNA transcripts that were identical to the virion RNA (except for designed mutations and perhaps a few extra nucleotides at either terminus) allowed genetic manipulation using the standard inoculation procedures previously in use for virion RNAs (Ahlquist et al., 1984) . The current ideal is to clone a full-length viral cDNA in a high-copy-number bacterial plasmid behind a promoter for a commercially available RNA polymerase. Most viruses with relatively small RNA genomes have been amenable for such a genetic system. However, some viruses are inherently difficult to clone due to the instability of the viral cDNA, often because the viral sequences are toxic to the bacterium (Boyer and Haenni, 1994; Lai, 2000) .",

            "text": "The cloning difficulties of some recalcitrant viral genomes have been surmounted by a variety of methods. In vitro ligation of individually cloned cDNA fragments followed by in vitro transcription and transfection was used to overcome the cloning difficulties of Yellow fever virus, Mouse hepatitis virus, Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and Beet necrotic yellow vein virus RNA2 (Quillet et al., 1989; Rice et al., 1989; Yount et al., 2000 Yount et al., , 2002 . The disadvantages of this approach, though, are relatively low levels of full-length cDNA and reduced levels of RNA transcripts compared to that of in vitro transcripts from a complete clone in one plasmid. Another approach is to reduce the toxicity of viral sequences in high-copy-number plasmids by inserting introns into the viral sequences. Recently, cDNA clones of TGEV, Japanese encephalitis flavivirus, Pea seedborne mosaic virus, and Plum pox virus were stabilized by this method (Johansen, 1996; L\u00f3pez-Moya and Garc\u00eda, 2000; Yamshchikov et al., 2001; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2002) . This strategy, however, requires cytoplasmic viruses to have a nuclear phase and also requires that the viral sequences not have endogenous intron sequences, which has been suggested as a possible problem of large cytoplasmic RNA viruses (Lai, 2000) . In fact, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) appears to be an example of such a virus with an endogenous intron, based on the fact that the infectivity of 35S:cDNA constructs are several orders of magnitude less than RNA transcripts and often are infectious in only certain plant species (W.O. Dawson, unpublished data) . Moreover, most cells of tobacco plants with transgenes of the infectious cDNA of TMV behind the 35S promoter do not become infected from the transgene, although they do become infected via virus movement from other cells (Turpen, 1992) . Yet another approach is to avoid the use of high-copy-number plasmids. The reticent RNA genome of TGEV could be propagated in Escherichia coli when cloned into a bacterial artificial chromosome, a lowcopy-number plasmid (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2000) . Other approaches avoid the use of bacteria. Vaccinia virus was used as a vector to clone the coronaviruses, Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Human coronavirus (Casais et al., 2001; Thiel et al., 2001) . Although this approach allowed the cloning of the full-length coronavirus cDNA, the viral cDNA in the vaccinia virus vector is not very amenable for mutational analysis, requiring multiple cycles of ligation and recombination. Here we report an additional strategy to allow cloning of recalcitrant viral cDNAs in high-copy-number plasmids in E. coli that can be added to the repertoire of strategies available.",

            "text": "The development of infectious cDNA clones of CTV was difficult due to the large size of the genomic RNA and its toxicity to E. coli (Satyanarayana et al., 1999) . We were able to maintain the plasmids containing the viral cDNA in only one strain of E. coli, which after transformation grew very slowly into minute colonies. However, we found that this level of growth was due to a fortuitous frameshift in the CTV cDNA that allowed its cloning by reducing the toxicity to E. coli. The corrected cDNA exhibited substantially greater toxicity to E. coli, now requiring 3 days to see visible colonies. Examination of other frameshift mutations demonstrated that 6 -7 U's functioned as \"slippery\" frameshift sites, reducing toxicity to E. coli if positioned appropriately near the toxicity region in the viral cDNA. Thus, purposely introduced frameshift mutations into oligo(U) regions in a toxic viral cDNA can provide a compromise between infectivity and toxicity to E. coli. If hosts cells are susceptible enough to allow a reduction in infectivity, frameshift mutations can be inserted in the viral cDNA to allow cloning in high-copy-number plasmids of E. coli.",

CTV-\u232cCla contains the 5\u0408-nontranslated region (NTR) plus ORFs 1a and 1b and the first 105 nts of ORF 2 (nts 1-11,005) fused to the 3\u0408 768 nts of the genomic RNA that includes part of the p23 ORF and the 3\u0408-NTR (nts 18,526 -19,293) . The cDNA of this small replicon with the ten 3\u0408 genes (7.5 kb) deleted is much easier to manipulate than the full-length virus (Satyanarayana et al., 2002b) . The in vitro generated RNA transcripts were biologically active as evidenced by their replication in Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts and synthesis of sgRNAs (Fig. 1 , CTV9 and CTV-\u232cCla), and production of viable CTV9 virions that passaged with a specific infectivity similar to that of the parental wild-type virus Satyanarayana et al., 1999 Satyanarayana et al., , 2002a Satyanarayana et al., , 2002b . The RNA transcripts of full-length CTV and the replicon replicated similarly in citrus protoplasts (data not shown). The recombinant virus had a phenotype identical to that of the parental wild-type virus in citrus trees .",

However, E. coli transformed with purified plasmid DNAs of pCTV9R or pCTV-\u232cClaR produced visible colonies slightly earlier.

Both accumulated 30-to 50-fold less viral RNAs than that of the wild-type CTV-\u232cClaR (Fig. 4B, f and g) . These results suggested that the homopolymeric stretch of U's in ORF 1a are shift-prone sequences.",

Since the original full-length (CTV9) and replicon (CTV-\u232cCla) cDNA clones were equally toxic to E. coli (the repaired clones equally more toxic) (Fig. 6) , the toxic region appeared to be located within ORFs 1a or 1b. The frameshift at nt 3732 reduced the toxicity of the original clones, suggesting that the toxicity domain was between nts 3732 and 11011. This location is supported by the observation that, when constructing cDNA clones for assembly of the fulllength cDNA clone, we were able to clone the sequences between NcoI (nt 3685) and BstEII (nt 7775) only in the reverse orientation in pUC119 (pT36-Nco-Bst; Satyanarayana et al., 1999). The schematic diagram of CTV replicon, CTV-\u232cClaR, containing ORF 1a and 1b plus portions of ORFs 2 and 11 (a). Selected unique restriction sites used to generate mutants in CTV-\u232cClaR are indicated above the diagram. The \u03e91 insertion found at nt 3732 (nt in bold) in CTV-\u232cCla (b) is shown below the CTV-\u232cClaR. The expanded view of ORF 1a is shown below CTV-\u232cClaR with the location of \u03e91 or \u03e92 insertion, and \u03ea1 deletion mutations in ORF 1a (c-h). The inserted nucleotides are shown in bold. The nucleotide in bold and underlined was deleted in \u232cClaR-M6 (g). The different domains of ORF 1a are as outlined in the legend for We examined the effects of the other frameshift mutations on toxicity to E. coli. The purified plasmids containing the frameshift mutations were used to transform E. coli strain JM109, and bacterial growth on LB agar plates was compared with that of E. coli transformed with pCTV9, pCTV-\u232cCla, pCTV9R, pCTV-\u232cClaR, pUC119, and pTMV (Dawson et al., 1988) . Mutants with frameshift mutations between nts 3732 and 7084 (p\u232cClaR-M1, -M4, -M5, -M6, pCTV9, and pCTV-\u232cCla) produced colonies of 0.2-0.9 mm diameter at 1 day posttransformation (dpt) and 0.9 -1.6 mm diameter at 2 dpt, respectively (Figs. 2 and 6) , compared to 1.5-1.8 and 2.6 -2.7 mm diameter colonies containing pUC119 and pTMV at 1 and 2 dpt, respectively. However, we failed to observe visible colonies under the microscope with the p\u232cClaR-M3 (with a frameshift mutation at nt 1109), p\u232cClaR-M2 (with a frameshift at nt 8390), pCTV9R, or pCTV-\u232cClaR after overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C; however, the colonies grew to 0.2-0.3 mm diameter after 2 days of incubation (Fig. 6) . Thus, the frameshift mutations in ORF 1a around the IDR (p\u232cClaR-M1, -M4, -M5, -M6) minimized the toxicity to E. coli, while the mutations introduced before (p\u232cClaR-M3) or after (p\u232cClaR-M2) failed to minimize the toxicity (Fig. 6) , suggesting that the toxicity region was located between nts 3732 and 8390.",

Oligo(U) stretches have been identified as slippery sequences that are involved in frameshifting of other viruses (Wilson et al., 1988; Brierley et al., 1992; Honda et al., 1995; Kim et al., 2001) . However, frameshifting also is often associated with downstream structures in the RNA (Jacks et al., 1988; Brierley et al., 1992; Chamorro et al., 1992; Vickers and Ecker, 1992; Chen et al., 1995; Marczinke et al., 1998; Barry and Miller, 2002) . In HIV, a run of 6 U's is required for efficient \u03ea1 frameshifting to produce the gag-pol proteins with an extended run of U's resulting in slightly increased levels of frameshifting (Wilson et al., 1988; Honda et al., 1995) . However, Parkin et al. (1992) reported that a stem-loop structure 3\u0408 of the HIV \u03ea1 shift site was important for wild-type levels of frameshifting in vivo. Nevertheless, downstream structures appeared not to be needed in the observed repair of the frameshift mutations after replication in N. benthamiana protoplasts. We did not identify any common structures by examining the sequences with the MFOLD program (data not shown). Also, since we examined all of the 6 U-regions, none of which are thought to naturally be involved in frameshifting, there is no expectation that all would conserve some accessory structure needed for frameshifting.",

Viral RNA polymerases are known to be error prone (Drake and Holland, 1999) without an error repair mechanism, defining viruses as pseudospecies of sequence variants (Domingo et al., 1995) . It has been argued that recombination and selection are the viral mechanisms to repair errors. Slippery sequences could serve as an additional repair mechanism. If a mutation occurs upstream of a slippery sequence, a frameshift could repair the mistake if the intervening altered amino acids are tolerated. Perhaps there is an advantage for CTV to have slippery sequences scattered throughout ORF 1a. This could be one of the reasons some CTV isolates have been observed to have a high degree of evolutionary stasis .",

The number of protoplasts that became infected with RNA transcripts from the frameshifted clone was reduced by 30-to 50-fold when compared to that of the corrected clone. However, the toxicity in E. coli was greatly reduced. Bacterial colonies were visible after 1 day, even though they were minute, compared to 2-3 days with the repaired clone. The progeny virus from the frameshifted clone was repaired; it did not contain the original frameshift caused by the inserted nucleotide and had a phenotype identical to the parental wild-type virus . Thus, the frameshift mutation appeared to have no negative impact on the value of the clones other than the initial reduc-tion in infectivity. Developing an infectious, full-length cDNA clone of CTV was difficult. It is unlikely that we would have obtained an infectious full-length clone without a fortuitous frameshift mutation in the original full-length cDNA clone.",

            "text": "These results suggest that purposely inserting frameshifts at slippery sequences of viral cDNAs that are toxic to E. coli could be an additional strategy for cloning these viruses in convenient high-copy-number plasmids. The frameshift provides a compromise: a reduction of infectivity for a decrease in toxicity in E. coli. If the host system is susceptible enough to provide infection with a couple of magnitudes of decrease in infectivity, the frameshift should allow growth of an infectious clone in E. coli. If the host cells are even more susceptible, it is possible that two frameshifts could be used. As is evident from this work, all frameshifts in slippery sequences will not minimize the toxicity to E. coli. The frameshift must be positioned to prevent expression of the toxicity domain, similar to the insertion of introns for the same purpose. We examined only stretches of U's, but if the frameshifting occurred during translation, it is likely that other identified slippery sequences would also work. Since the repair of the frameshift mutations was due to in vitro transcription or translation in protoplasts, neither of which are virus-specific functions, the purposeful introduction of frameshift mutations into frameshift-prone sequences in front of toxic regions should work for any recalcitrant positive-stranded RNA virus. Thus, this strategy provides an additional approach in the virologist's reper- Fig. 6 .
