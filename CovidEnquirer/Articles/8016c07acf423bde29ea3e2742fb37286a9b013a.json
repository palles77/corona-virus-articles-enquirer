These recommendations were made using available evidence from human and veterinary medical literature, and, where evidence was lacking, the combined opinions and clinical experiences of the panel members were used to develop recommendations. The goal of the optimal standards is to minimize risk to the best of our ability by application of currently available diagnostic tests. However, the panel acknowledged that application of all diagnostic tests might not be relevant for all geographic locations and donor backgrounds (eg, breed, environment) and some diagnostic tests have limited availability or could be cost prohibitive for some programs. Therefore, the minimal standards were developed taking into account these factors. In some cases, this approach unfortunately could result in movement of infected animals into the donor pool. The panel also discussed alternative acceptable strategies for geographic regions where the prevalence of infection may be high and identification of suitable donors is difficult as well as screening of potential donors when blood is required in an emergency situation and time does not permit thorough screening before donation. An apparently healthy donor may be acceptable in that situation given the low risk of transmission of infection when weighed alongside a high risk of death of the recipient in the absence of blood product transfusion. However, preemptive identification and screening of healthy blood donors remains an important strategy of safe blood banking.",

However, in situations where the prevalence of infection is low (as is the case for some pathogens in healthy animals compared with sick animals), positive results are more likely to represent false positives than in regions of high prevalence (low positive predictive value), and consideration should be given to verifying such positive results with a second test, preferably using a reference laboratory.

Although transient bacteremia can occur in healthy animals after disruption of mucosal barriers, transfusion of blood from animals with transient bacteremia has not been documented to cause disease in a recipient. Therefore, routine blood culture generally is not indicated for screening potential blood donors, with rare exceptions (see Bartonella section). In transfusion medicine, routine Serum Antigen Tests. Assays that detect antigens of several blood-borne pathogens in whole blood or serum are commercially available. Dirofilaria immitis (dogs and cats) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen tests are used most frequently for donor screening and health assessment. Point-of-care tests are available for both organisms, and the potential for inaccurate results from operator error is small. Molecular Assays. Because the immune system generally clears nonviable microbes quickly, amplification of specific microbial nucleic acids using assays like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) generally indicates the presence of viable microbes, provided laboratory quality assurance is high. These techniques can provide high analytic sensitivity and specificity and the potential to rapidly test for more than 1 pathogen. Disadvantages include the current lack of point-of-care nucleic acidbased assays in veterinary medicine; lack of standardization of assays among laboratories, which results in variable sensitivities and specificities; lack of assay availability for some infectious agents; and expense. Also, high analytical sensitivity of a PCR assay does not necessarily imply high clinical sensitivity. In other words, an assay may detect minute quantities of DNA in the laboratory but have poor sensitivity for detection of a pathogen in a blood specimen. Most PCR assays utilize 10-200 lL of blood, and animals can receive over 10,000 times that volume during a transfusion. Although most molecular assays have high analytical sensitivity, these assays cannot amplify microbes that are not in the specimen collected; thus, false negative results can occur with some agents found in very low quantities in the bloodstream, such as Ehrlichia canis and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).",

Transmission of A. phagocytophilum occurs via Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus ticks in the United States. Widespread subclinical infections followed by pathogen clearance appear common in both humans and dogs. A further pathway for transmission is via infected blood, either experimentally or by blood transfusion. 3 In human medicine, several reports of transfusion-transmission of A. phagocytophilum via different blood products (non-leukoreduced/leukoreduced RBCs, leukoreduced platelets) and also transfusiontransmitted granulocytic anaplasmosis have been documented. 4,5 Widespread subclinical infections followed by pathogen clearance appear common in both humans and dogs, and in immunocompromised or elderly people such infections can cause severe disease. Donation screening or inactivation by pathogen reduction tech-nologies is considered in human medicine. 5 Anaplasmosis occurred in a splenectomized dog on chemotherapy after a packed RBC transfusion; both the donor and recipient tested positive by PCR (Kohn unpublished data). PCR positive dogs can be seronegative and can have clinical and hematologic variables within reference intervals. 6, 7 Antibodies to Anaplasma species can be detected using IFA assays, automated fluorescencebased systems, a point-of-care lateral flow ELISA assay, a or laboratory-based ELISA assays. b,7,8 Serologic cross-reactivity among Anaplasma species occurs in some assays, but not all ( Table 3 ). The seroprevalence (IFA or ELISA) is high in endemic areas (up to 50%) and antibody titers may persist for several months or even years. 6, 9 The extent to which A. phagocytophilum can persist in tissues and contribute to chronic disease manifestations in humans and dogs currently is unknown. In 1 study, treatment of experimentally infected dogs with prednisolone up to 6 months after infection was followed by development of positive PCR results for the organism, and in some dogs, thrombocytopenia and reappearance of morulae on blood smears. 10 In another study, dogs infected with A. phagocytophilum by exposure to wild-caught Ixodes scapularis ticks were PCR positive for at least 12 weeks. 7 In light of the above information, the panel recommends that optimal standards are to screen donors using both serology and PCR, and dogs that test positive with 1 or both assays should be excluded. Exclusion of all seropositive dogs might limit the donor pool in endemic areas (see comments in Table 1 ).",

Kenneled dogs and research animals appear to be at higher risk for infection by M. haemocanis. Diagnosis of infection is based on PCR assay of whole blood. 32 No serologic assay for hemoplasma infection is commercially available. In general, dogs are subclinically infected with these organisms, but M. haemocanis can cause anemia in splenectomized dogs, with a few case reports of infected dogs with other immunocompromising comorbidities. Only a single clinical infection with \"Candidatus M. haematoparvum\" has been reported in a splenectomized dog with hemic neoplasia being treated with chemotherapy, and it was unclear to what extent the hemoplasma played a role in development of anemia. 33 This dog received several units of blood products, some of which tested positive using PCR for \"Candidatus M. haematoparvum,\" and tested negative before transfusion (Sykes et al, unpublished data). Therefore, optimally, donor dogs should be screened for all hemoplasma by PCR assay and excluded if positive (Table 1) . However, until more is learned about the risk of transfusing blood testing positive for \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" and \"Candidatus M. haematoparvum\", testing for these pathogens could be considered optional. It also should be kept in mind that the prevalence of hemoplasma infection in the general client-owned pet dog population in North America appears to be low (<5%). 34 Whether the viability of canine hemoplasma species is lost during storage of blood products (see feline hemoplasmas) requires further study. Because antimicrobial therapy does not reliably eliminate hemoplasmas, the panel does not recommend treating potential donors with antimicrobials in an attempt to eliminate infection.",

The vector in North America is not known; Lutzomyia shannoni is the most highly suspected vector in the United States, but dog-to-dog transmission also has been hypothesized. 37 Visceral leishmaniosis, caused by Leishmania donovani, is considered an exotic disease in dogs in North America, with the exception of the foxhound population in which it is endemic. 38 Dogs in North America also have acquired the infection during travel to foreign countries months to years before diagnosis. Visceral leishmaniosis has been transmitted by blood transfusion to dogs, with clinically healthy foxhounds as blood donors. 39 A retrospective study (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) performed on 12,000 serum samples from foxhounds and other canids in the United States reported an 8.9% seroprevalence in foxhounds, but no other randomly selected domestic dogs or wild canids were seropositive. 40 Because the infection appears to be only endemic within foxhounds in North America, screening of every potential blood donor is not necessary. However, all foxhounds and dogs with travel history to or from endemic countries should be screened for Leishmania spp infection using IFA serology performed by a reputable laboratory. Because IFA serology may lack sensitivity in subclinically infected dogs, 41 foxhounds or dogs living in or traveling to endemic areas, and found to be seronegative should then be screened additionally by Leishmania PCR. 38, 42, 43 The IFA assay for Leishmania spp. can cross-react with Trypanosoma cruzi. 44 Although dogs with either infection should be excluded as blood donors, Leishmania spp. seropositive dogs can be evaluated for the presence of specific antibodies to T. cruzi if further clinical information is desired. 44 Neorickettsia risticii. Dogs can be experimentally infected with N. risticii, and antibodies to N. risticii have been detected in pet dogs. [45] [46] [47] Polymerase chain reaction was used in 1 study to identify N. risticii obtained from blood cultures of 2 clinically ill dogs. 48 There is no documentation of transmission of N. risticii to dogs by blood transfusion. 45 Although the committee believes that optimally dogs should test PCR-negative for Neorickettsia risticii infections, no screening is also acceptable.",

            "text": "Trypanosoma cruzi. American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a hemoflagellate protozoan. Transmission most commonly occurs through a feces-contaminated bite from, or ingestion of, triatomine bug vectors. 51 A small number of transfusion-acquired T. cruzi infections have been reported in people in North America. All patients were immunocompromised at the time of infection, and 6 of the donors were from countries where T. cruzi is endemic (South and Central America). 52 In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration recommended that all presenting human blood donors be asked about a history of Chagas disease in addition to being tested at least once using a licensed screening test. 53,54 Infection in dogs can result in acute or chronic myocarditis, but in 1 study, 55 dogs that were experimentally inoculated with T. cruzi were parasitemic but only developed transient lymphadenopathy. Survivors of acute disease can remain subclinically infected for several months until chronic myocarditis develops. Infection is characterized by detectable concentrations of specific antibodies and low concentrations of circulating parasites. 56 Most dogs that develop trypanosomiasis in the United States reside in Texas or in the southwestern states. The seroprevalence in a 2014 study of 205 dogs from 7 shelters in diverse ecoregions in Texas was 8.8%. 57 Transmission to dogs by blood transfusion has not been reported. Dogs with a history of travel to and from endemic areas (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, southern California, Mexico, Central America and South America) should be considered for serological screening by IFA, indirect hemagglutination assays (IHA), ELISA, or immunochromatographic dipstick tests, and seropositive donors should be excluded from the donor pool. Serologic cross-reactions between T. cruzi and Leishmania spp. have been documented. 58 A PCR assay to detect T. cruzi in whole blood also could be considered. 59 Non Vector-borne Pathogens-Testing Recommended Brucella canis. Brucella canis, a zoonotic pathogen, is a gram-negative bacterium that causes brucellosis in dogs. Venereal transmission can occur during breeding, or transmission can follow oronasal contact with vaginal discharges, aborted material, and urine from infected dogs. In humans, only a few transfusion-transmitted Brucella infections have been documented worldwide. 60-62 Transmission of B. canis by blood transfusion has not been documented in dogs. However, infection is associated with prolonged bacteremia that may be subclinical, and thus the potential for transmission by transfusion exists. 63 Because it is commercially available and results can be obtained in minutes, serological screening of potential donors for antibodies using the rapid slide agglutination test (RSAT) initially is recommended. e Positive dogs should be excluded as blood donors and additional confirmatory diagnostic assays performed using blood culture, PCR on whole blood, tube agglutination tests, agarose gel immunodiffusion tests, or ELISA tests. A single negative RSAT is sufficient for neutered donors to meet optimal standards, but RSAT screening should be repeated in sexually active intact dogs. This approach is supported by numerous studies that have concluded that RSAT is highly sensitive, but lacks specificity. 64 In recent studies, PCR assays performed on whole blood or genitourinary secretions were found to be more sensitive than serologic tests, notably in the early phase of infection.

Lyme borreliosis is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which is vectored by Ixodes spp. 70 Many dogs in the northeastern and upper Midwest regions of the United States are seropositive, and a small percentage of dogs develop polyarthritis or nephritis. 71 Transfusion-related infections have not been reported. Despite the ability to culture B. burgdorferi from human blood, 72 studies in humans have demonstrated that the risk of acquiring Lyme disease from a transfused unit of packed red blood cells or platelets is negligible. 73, 74 In a study in dogs, only 1.6% of 576 blood samples from experimentally infected dogs tested positive for B. burgdorferi by PCR. 75 The consensus of the panel is that healthy canine blood donors should not be screened for B. burgdorferi. If a screening test a,b that detects seroreactivity to other pathogens is used and the donor is seropositive to B. burgdorferi, that animal need not be excluded from the donor pool.",

Bartonella henselae infection was only documented by PCR assay in 2 of 117 (1.7%) community source cats used as blood donors in the United States, which likely reflects the use of flea control products. 83 Infected cats typically have a prolonged, subclinical bacteremia, but a number of clinical sequelae also occur. 21,84 Bartonella spp. can be transmitted by blood transfusion and storing blood does not inactivate the organism. f The most sensitive way to document Bartonella spp. in the blood of cats is by the concurrent use of specialized culture media and PCR assay using several blood samples. 25 Although this approach frequently is needed to prove the presence of Bartonella spp. in the blood of clinically ill dogs, whether the increased sensitivity is needed for screening cats to be used as blood donors remains to be proven. Because cats are the definitive host for B. henselae, high levels of bacteremia often are detected even when the cats are healthy. Thus, broad range PCR assays or PCR assays using specific primers that are used widely in commercial laboratories in the United States are likely to detect most infected cats (Table 3) . Bacteremia in cats infected with B. henselae by exposure to infected C. felis precedes seroconversion by 7-42 days and thus serology alone is inadequate as a screening test. 84 However, after immune responses develop, bacteremia can be intermittent in cats and a false negative result could occur only if a single sample is assayed. 85 Thus, the panel recommends as the optimal standard to use cats that are seronegative and PCR assay or culture negative (Table 2) .",

Although seropositive, many healthy cats infected by B. henselae-infected C. felis will limit bacteremia over time. Thus, the panel believes the minimal standard is to use a Bartonella spp. PCR negative cat ( Table 2) . Use of antibiotics does not consistently eliminate Bartonella spp. infections in cats, and thus PCR or culture positive cats should be excluded from the blood donor program. 87 Cytauxzoon felis. Cytauxzoon felis is a tickborne protozoal pathogen in the order Piroplasmida and family Theileriidae. In this section, cytauxzoonosis is used to denote the acute illness (ie, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, cytopenias, multi-organ failure) associated with C. felis infection. After tick transmission, the organism undergoes schizogony in myeloid cells (specific lineage is unknown) followed by merogony in erythrocytes. The schizogenous stage is associated with illness and disease can be transmitted experimentally by transmission of blood from a cat with cytauxzoonosis to a naive cat. 88 The majority of cats with cytauxzoonosis that are presented to veterinary hospitals develop severe febrile illness, cytopenias, and often die within 5 days of presentation if appropriate treatments are not given. A carrier state (erythrocyte infection only) has been identified that is not associated with clinical disease. 89 In fact, transfusion of blood from a chronically infected cat into a naive cat does not result in illness. A theoretical risk for transmission of cytauxzoonosis exists because parasitemia can precede illness. In experimental infection, parasite DNA can be detected as early as 7 days post-infection but clinical signs do not begin until 10-21 days post-infection. Serological assays are not available. Use of indoor only cats receiving appropriate ectoparasite prophylaxis is advised to avoid this disease in donor animals. Appropriate donor selection and pre-donation physical examinations should minimize transmission risk. The panel recommends as the optimal standard to use PCR negative cats in endemic areas (Table 2) .",

Other species of hemoplasmas that infect cats in North America are \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" (Mhm) and \"Candidatus M. turicensis\" (Mtc), but these organisms are substantially less pathogenic and frequently detected (10-25% prevalence) using PCR in the blood of nonanemic client-owned pet cats that are either apparently healthy or brought to veterinary clinics for reasons other than anemia. 83, [93] [94] [95] By contrast, in North America, M. haemofelis is rarely (<1%) detected in non-anemic cats using PCR. 94, 95 When cats that were chronically infected with \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" were splenectomized and concurrently treated with high doses of glucocorticoids, persistent subclinical infection occurred in the absence of anemia. 96 Although fleas have been suggested to be involved in transmission, the evidence for flea-borne transmission is weak. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that aggressive interactions between cats may lead to transmission. 95 Intravenous inoculation of infected blood has been used to produce experimental infections. 97 No serologic assay for infection is commercially available. Blood smear evaluation is insensitive (especially for chronic carrier cats) and also lacks specificity (organisms can be easily confused with stain precipitate or drying artifacts), and thus the diagnostic test of choice for screening blood donors is PCR. Because of the pathogenicity of M. haemofelis, the panel agreed that all cats should be tested for M. haemofelis and those that test positive should be excluded from the blood donor pool. Optimally, cats should be tested for \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" and \"Candidatus M. turicensis\" and excluded from the donor pool, but given the high prevalence of these organisms in the cat population and the lack of strong evidence that they are associated with disease even in immunosuppressed cats, the panel agreed that screening for these pathogens could be considered optional and positive cats could be used as donors in the absence of a source of negative blood ( Table 2) . Because antimicrobial therapy does not reliably eliminate hemoplasmas (and appears particularly ineffective for treatment of \"Candidatus M. haemominu-tum\" infections), the panel does not recommend treating potential donors with antimicrobials in an attempt to eliminate infection.",

With the recognition that cats exposed to FeLV can develop regressive infection (defined as transient or undetectable antigenemia with proviral DNA in the blood), optimally real-time PCR testing for proviral DNA should be performed, because FeLV provirus is infectious. 101, 102 However, PCR assays for FeLV proviral DNA currently available in the United States have not been evaluated for clinical sensitivity and specificity. Regressor cats have detectable proviral DNA and viral RNA in many tissues, including the bone marrow, many years after FeLV exposure, indicating that these cats do not completely clear the virus. 103 Regressor cats can transmit FeLV infection to recipient cats through blood transfusions, and the recipients can then go on to develop progressive infection. g Furthermore, reactivation of FeLV infection in regressor cats with and without immune suppression has been reported. 103 Reactivation of a regressive FeLV infection has the potential to place FeLV-negative donor cats at risk if housed together in a colony situation if reactivation occurs in the interval between routine screening tests (eg, annual screening) and is not detected.
