            "text": "The problem of the asymptotic dynamics of a quarantine/isolation model with time delay is considered, subject to two incidence functions, namely standard incidence and the Holling type II (saturated) incidence function. Rigorous qualitative analysis of the model shows that it exhibits essentially the same (equilibrium) dynamics regardless of which of the two incidence functions is used. In particular, for each of the two incidence functions, the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever the associated reproduction threshold quantity is less than unity. Further, it has a unique endemic equilibrium when the threshold quantity exceeds unity. For the case with the Holling type II incidence function, it is shown that the unique endemic equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable for a special case. The permanence of the disease is also established for the model with the Holling type II incidence function. Furthermore, it is shown that adding time delay to and/or replacing the standard incidence function with the Holling type II incidence function in the corresponding autonomous quarantine/isolation model with standard incidence (considered in Safi and Gumel (2010) [10]) does not alter the qualitative dynamics of the autonomous system (with respect to the elimination or persistence of the disease). Finally, numerical simulations of the model with standard incidence show that the disease burden decreases with increasing time delay (incubation period). Furthermore, models with time delay seem to be more suitable for modeling the 2003 SARS outbreaks than those without time delay.",

Quarantine and isolation measures have been widely used, over the decades, to control the spread of diseases such as yellow fever, smallpox, measles, ebola, pandemic influenza, diphtheria, plague, cholera, and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . To achieve the main objective of this study, the autonomous quarantine/isolation presented in [10] will be extended to incorporate time delay and two different incidence functions. The functional forms of the incidence functions to be considered are derived on the basis of the framework described below.",

Further, let \u03b2(N) be the average number of contacts sufficient for transmitting infection (effective contact rate). Then, the force of infection, given by \u03b2(N)I/N, represents the average number of contacts that a susceptible individual makes with infectious individuals per unit time. If \u03b2(N) = \u03b2N (i.e., the contact rate depends on the total population, N), then the incidence function g 1 (I) = \u03b2I is called mass action incidence. If \u03b2(N) = \u03b2 (a constant), then the incidence function g 2 (I) = \u03b2I/N is called standard incidence [11, 12] . These two functions are widely used in the modeling the transmission dynamics of the human diseases [13, 14] . Another widely used incidence function is the Holling type II incidence function, given by g 3 (I) = \u03b2I 1+\u03c9I , with \u03c9 > 0, [15] [16] [17] [18] . The non-linear incidence function of type g 3 (I) was first introduced by Capasso and Serio [15] , in their study of the cholera epidemic in Bari, Italy. The main justification for using such a functional form of the incidence function stems from the fact that the number of effective contacts between infective individuals and susceptible individuals may saturate at high infective levels due to crowding of infective individuals, or due to the preventive measures taken by (and behavioral changes of) the susceptible individuals in response to the severity of the disease [16] [17] [18] . The paper is organized as follows. The model with standard incidence is formulated in Section 2. The existence and global asymptotic stability of its disease-free equilibrium (DFE), as well as the existence of its endemic equilibrium point (EEP), are established in Section 3. The model with the Holling type II incidence function is formulated and analyzed in Section 4. The permanence of the disease is also established for this model.",

One of the main aims of this study is to determine whether or not incorporating time delay (for the incubation period) alters the qualitative dynamics of the autonomous quarantine/isolation model considered in [10] . Another major objective is to determine whether replacing the standard incidence function in the model (1) with the Holling type II incidence function \ued5b g 3 (I) = I 1+\u03c9I \ued5f will introduce new (or different) dynamical features for the delayed model (1).",

It should be mentioned, however, that the solutions depicted in Fig. 3 did not converge to zero, as they appear to (see Fig. 4 for a blow up of the tail end of Fig. 3 ). In other words, Figs. 3 and 4 show convergence of the solutions to the unique EEP, E S 1 , of the model (3) for the case R S 0 > 1. The following conjecture is suggested: In summary, the model (3) has a globally asymptotic stable disease-free equilibrium whenever R S 0 < 1, and it has a unique endemic equilibrium whenever R S 0 > 1. These results are consistent with those reported for the corresponding autonomous (non-delayed) quarantine/isolation model in [10] . In other words, adding time delay to the non-delayed quarantine/isolation model in [10] does not alter its qualitative (equilibrium) dynamics. The next task is to determine whether or not the dynamics of the non-delayed quarantine/isolation model in [10] is affected by the combined use of time delay and the substitution of the standard incidence function with the Holling type II incidence function.

It should be stated that the GTA recorded about 250 probable cases of Table 3 , with \u03b2 = 0.15. SARS during the 2003 outbreaks [21] . The simulation results obtained, depicted in Fig. 9 , show that while the model without time delay (considered in [10] ) underestimated the observed cumulative number of probable cases (about 170 cases), the model with time delay (i.e., model (3)) gave a good estimate of the observed data (about 220 cases). Thus, this study suggests that the model (3), with time delay, is more appropriate for modeling the SARS outbreaks in the GTA than the corresponding model without time delay (given in [10] ). Similar simulation results were obtained for the case of the model with Holling type II function (16) (see Fig. 10 ).",

(ii) The model with Holling type II incidence function, given by (16) , has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free solution whenever its associated epidemiological threshold quantity (R H 0 ) is less than unity (Theorem 2). This model has In summary, the theoretical analyses in this study show that adding time delay to and/or replacing the standard incidence function by a Holling type II incidence function in the autonomous (non-delayed) quarantine/isolation model in [10] does not alter the qualitative dynamics (as regards the elimination or persistence of the disease) of the non-delayed model considered in [10] . In other words, the theoretical results in this study show that the quarantine/isolation model with time delay (\u03c4 > 0) and standard or non-linear incidence function of Holling type II has essentially the same qualitative (equilibrium) dynamics as the corresponding autonomous quarantine/isolation model (\u03c4 = 0) with the standard incidence function considered in [10] .",
