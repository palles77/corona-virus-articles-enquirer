This method was used for assay of the antibody against adult rotavirus in 1,380 sera of healthy adults obtained from some provinces and cities of China, of which 141 showed a positive result with a total positive rate of 10.2%. The infection rate varied in different regions. In order to confirm the accuracy of these results a blocking test was carried out on 25 positive specimens, and the results revealed that the P/N ratios after blocking were all lower than those before blocking. Seventeen of these 25 positive serum specimens were obtained from rural areas of Qian'an County, Hebei Province where epidemic adult diarrhoea had occurred two years ago. The antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus was not detected in 50 adult sera from Xizang Autonomous Region. Only one out of 50 adult sera from Hainan Island was positive for the antibody.",

However, a method of using unknown serum to coat the wells of the microtiter plate directly in using the sandwich ELISA method with double antibodies for the assay of the antibody against rotavirus in unknown serum has not been published. Our recent use of this method was successful in the assay of antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus in a total of 1,380 sera of healthy adults obtained from some provinces and cities of China.

The supematant fluid was mixed with an equal volume of chloroform and centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant fluid was aspirated out and centrifuged at a superspeed of 51,000 rpm for 2 h. A small amount of PBS was used to resuspend the precipitate. Density gradient centrifugation was carried out by layering the suspension on 45% sucrose, 60% sucrose and 40% cesium chloride and centrifuging at a superspeed of 40,000 rpm for 2 h. The cesium chloride portion in the lower layer was collected and taken as the purified adult rotavirus antigen after dialysis against PBS. Electron microscopic observation showed complete rotavirus particles with typical structure together with a large number of degraded particles. Its content of virus particles was 106~5-10s/ml. RNA genome electrophoresis revealed the characteristic pattern of 11 segments of adult diarrhoea rotavirus RNA genome (Qiu et al., 1985) .",
