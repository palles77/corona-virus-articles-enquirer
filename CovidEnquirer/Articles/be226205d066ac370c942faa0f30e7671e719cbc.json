            "text": "We live in a world of moving parts, fragmented, altered landscapes, and vast networks of connections. Human travel today is unprecedented in volume, reach, and speed (Wilson, 1995a) . Spatial mobility for the average person increased more than 1000-fold between 1800 and 2000 ; see Figure 1 .1). Two million people cross international borders each day (WTO, 2006a) . Movement of humans may be the result of planned travel -for business, tourism, education or research, missionary or volunteer work, visiting friends or family, or military purposes -but abrupt displacement of populations can also be a consequence of war, natural disasters, economic, political, or environmental events (Myers, 2001) . Human activities have led to unprecedented movement or displacement of other species through intent (e.g. trade) or inadvertence (Smolinski et al., 2003) . The conveyances of travel, such as ships and airplanes, can become places for transmission of infectious diseases. The roads and railroad tracks built to carry people and products from one location to another can also fragment habitats and can lead to decreased biodiversity. Infectious diseases in people, plants, and animals are dynamic and are infl uenced by biological, environmental, socioeconomic, political, demographic, and genetic factors (Wilson et al., 1994; Wilson, 1995b) . The abundance and variety of microbial life and its ongoing evolution mean that we will continue to encounter new infections or altered expressions of old ones in the foreseeable future. Among the characteristics of the global population today that favor the appearance and spread of infections -size, density, location, vulnerability, inequalities, and mobility -the latter will be the focus of this chapter.",

            "text": "Why does travel matter in the epidemiology of infectious diseases? Although many microbes that cause infectious diseases are found throughout the world, many others have a focal distribution because of the need for specifi c geoclimatic conditions or a particular intermediate or reservoir host, poor sanitation or control efforts, or other factors. Even for microbes that are globally distributed, risk of Travel 1 exposure may vary greatly from one geographic area to another (Freedman et al., 2006) . Humans are interactive biological units; when they travel they can pick up pathogenic microbes that may make them sick (Wilson, 2003a) . Whether they get sick or not, they may also carry pathogens or microbial genetic material (including resistance genes and virulence factors) in or on their bodies to a new location. Depending on the type of organism, its transmission mechanisms, and immunity of contacts, travelers may be able to introduce a pathogen into a new population.",

Many of these activities can put them at risk for infections that did not exist in their home environment. Wilder-Smith et al., 2002; Dull et al., 2005 The development of the travel industry has also altered the landscape in many countries, where luxury hotels occupy prime real estate and new infrastructure is created to serve travelers. Although much travel tends to follow well-trodden paths to well-known places, increasingly travelers are seeking remote locationsand today's transportation technology makes it increasingly easier than ever before to reach these areas.",

Many infections transmitted from person to person, like measles, were no longer a threat by the time of arrival because passengers were dead or immune. After 1860 the faster steamship quickly replaced the sailing vessel, and with that technological advance came shorter boat trips that increased the risk of transmitting infectious agents across oceans. The time to travel from England to Australia had dropped from 100 days (by clipper in 1840) to 50 days by the early 1900s. The development of relatively inexpensive air travel further increased the risk of spreading infectious agents across vast distances. Now a traveler can reach almost any major city on Earth within 24 hours -less time than the incubation period of most infectious diseases.",

Those who return to their home country to visit friends and relatives (VFR) are more likely to visit rural areas or to stay in accommodations that lack good sanitary facilities and safe water. Because they are \"going home,\" they may be unaware of risks to themselves and their children (who may have been born in a developed country) and thus have inadequate preparation (e.g. vaccines, chemoprophylaxis).

Assuming homogeneous mixing of passengers, the risk of being exposed to a person with a communicable disease increases four-fold when an aircraft doubles in size -for example, from 200 to 400 passengers (Bradley, 1989) . The WTO forecast of growth in long-haul travel between regions over intraregional travel also illustrates the concept of an enlarging sphere of travel (WTO, 2006b ). In addition, regional shares for international tourist arrivals are shifting. The WTO predicts an average global growth of 4.1 percent in international tourist arrivals per year, but greater than average growth for Africa, and even greater growth of \u03fe6 percent for East Asia and the Pacifi c, South Asia, and the Middle East (see Figure 1 .3). Although Europe is projected to remain the most popular destination, its overall share in the market is predicted to decline. While Europe's and America's combined share in world tourist arrivals was \u03fe95 percent in 1950, it declined to 82 percent in 1990 and 76 percent in 2000. The shift of international travel to developing regions in tropical and subtropical regions also increases potential exposure to microbes and vectors endemic in those regions. Big international airports are typically situated near large metropolitan areas. In many of the developing, low-latitude regions (most of them tropical or subtropical), large periurban slums surround large cities, often populated by people with families in rural areas. Regularly scheduled international fl ights and their passengers bring these populations into potential contact, and link urban and rural biota of the world.",

For example, the seasonal infl uenza viruses can be spread by direct contact (e.g. by contaminated objects or from hands of infected person), by large or medium droplets, or by droplet nuclei (tiny-droplet aerosol) (Musher, 2003) . Tuberculosis, on the other hand, is spread by droplet nuclei that are small enough to bypass the trapping mechanisms of the upper airway and can reach the lungs. Neisseria meningitidis (the cause of meningococcal meningitis and sepsis) is spread by direct contact and large or medium droplets, but not by tiny-droplet aerosol. The mechanisms of transmission and transmissibility are key characteristics of microbes that infl uence ease of spread and determine what interventions will be effective. Timing of onset of infectiousness relative to onset of symptoms and duration of infectiousness are important factors in transmission dynamics.",

For an infection to be sustained in a new population, the basic reproductive rate must exceed one (May et al., 2001) . The R 0 for a specifi c infection may vary depending on time, place, and population. For example, in the pre-vaccine era the R 0 for measles was 16-18 in England and Wales in 1950-68, and 5-6 in Kansas, USA, in 1918-21 . A plausible explanation for the difference is differences in population density and mixing of populations. In the early 1980s, the R 0 for HIV was 11-12 in Nairobi, Kenya, in a prostitute population and 2-5 in male homosexuals in England and Wales (Anderson and May, 1991) . Based on detailed epidemiologic data from Singapore and other locations, Lipsitch and colleagues estimated that the reproductive number for SARS was about 3 (Lipsitch et al., 2003) . SARS was barely containable using isolation and quarantine measures. One biological characteristic of SARS that favored its control was that virtually all transmission occurred after patients had developed symptoms. This is not the case for seasonal infl uenza, HIV, and many other infections that can be transmitted in the absence of symptoms (Fraser et al., 2004) .",

Even if it can replicate, it must be able to avoid or overcome host immune response, exit from the cell, and infect additional cells. Finally, it must be able to exit the host in such a way that it can be transmitted to other humans. For many animal viruses, humans are always or usually a dead-end host (e.g. hantaviruses causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome), and are irrelevant in maintenance of the microbe in nature. The avian infl uenza A virus (H5N1) has not transmitted effi ciently from person to person as of mid-2006, and a potential explanation is that the cells in the upper respiratory tract of humans do not have receptors to which the virus can bind. The virus can replicate effi ciently only in the lower respiratory tract (alveolar cells) of humans, from which it is not transmitted easily by sneezing and coughing (Shinya et al., 2006) .",

In Singapore, for example, 162 (81 percent) of probable SARS patients showed no evidence of secondary transmission, whereas 5 persons each transmitted infection to 10 or more others (see Figure 1 .5; CDC 2003). Lloyd-Smith and colleagues showed that heterogeneity in transmission, instead of being an anomalous event, was a common feature of disease spread (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005) . In several examples, 20 percent of the cases caused 80 percent of the transmission. This is of more than theoretical interest, as it can affect the course of an epidemic and can infl uence the choice of interventions to try to curb the spread of infection (Galvani and May, 2005) . If highly contagious (or highly connected, for sexually transmitted infections) individuals can be identifi ed, it may be possible to contain spread with fewer resources. A small study that may be relevant to the topic of heterogeneity in transmission of respiratory pathogens assessed exhaled aerosols. Eleven healthy adult volunteers (18-65 years old) were connected to a device that measured the number and size of particles exhaled during quiet breathing. The number of exhaled particles varied dramatically among the subjects, ranging from 1 per liter to \u03fe10,000 per liter.

In March 2005, a 22-year-old woman from Arizona contracted paralytic polio caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus (CDC, 2006a) after travel for a study-abroad program. In Costa Rica, she had had contact with an infant recently vaccinated with live oral poliovirus. She was unvaccinated against polio because of a religious exemption. Cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) had occurred in the past in the US, but no cases had been reported since 1999. The ongoing movement of poliovirus is further highlighted by events in the US. In September 2005, vaccine-derived poliovirus was found in an unvaccinated, immunocompromised infant in Minnesota (CDC, 2005c) . Another four other children in the community also had asymptomatic infection.

            "text": "Dengue fever is an example that illustrates the interplay of multiple factors in the emergence and spread of an infection (see also Chapter 4). Dengue, a fl avivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions, is increasing in incidence and in geographic range. An estimated 100 million cases of dengue fever and 25,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and 25,000 deaths, occur annually (Gubler, 2002) . Four serologically distinct serotypes exist. Because infection confers immunity only to the infecting serotype, a person can be infected up to four times. Having had prior infection with a dengue virus increases the likelihood of severe dengue fever (hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome) if there is then infection with a different serotype. Viremic travelers are essential for the movement of the virus from place to place. The incubation period (usually 2-7 days) allows a person to move to another location before infection manifests. If mosquitoes competent to transmit dengue are present and one or more bite the infected person at the time the virus is in the bloodstream (median of 5 days but range of 1-12 days) (Gubler et al., 1981) and survive to transmit the virus to another human, infection can be established in a new area. The main mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, is well adapted to the contemporary urban landscape. It breeds well in discarded plastic cups, fl ower pots, used tires, and other urban litter, it prefers human blood, and it enters homes. Among the multiple reasons for the increase in dengue globally are: increased regional and global travel (including especially travel to tropical and subtropical areas) and trade; poor vector control and pesticide resistance, which has allowed expansion of the areas infested with Aedes aegypti; poor housing (absence of screens, doors) and water supply (water stored in containers that are good breeding sites for mosquitoes); growth of urban populations in tropical areas globally; and increase in number of urban areas that have reached a population size suffi cient to sustain the ongoing circulation of dengue viruses. Over the past two centuries, the number of dengue lineages has been increasing roughly in parallel with the size of the human population.",

Furthermore, they found that the wave started in Bangkok, the largest city, and moved radially at about 148 km per month. Although all four serotypes are continuously present in Bangkok, smaller communities may experience periods without infection from specifi c serotypes. In epidemic years, a lag of 10 months may occur before outbreaks develop in some areas. It suggests that dense urban centers are the genesis of viruses that cause epidemics that then migrate (in humans) to surrounding regions.",

Food-borne outbreaks (e.g. salmonellosis, shigellosis, cholera, staphylococcal food poisoning, and others) have been linked to food or beverages served on fl ights (Mangili and Gendreau, 2005) . Infections transmitted directly from person to person, and those that are airborne, also pose a risk to airplane travelers. Published reports describe transmission of tuberculosis, SARS, measles, and infl uenza on aircraft. In one outbreak, 72 percent of 54 passengers on a plane that had been grounded for Three hours because of a failed air-circulation system developed infl uenza-like illness; infl uenza A was documented (Moser et al., 1979) . Norovirus, a cause of acute gastroenteritis, has probably also been transmitted on an airplane (Widdowson et al., 2005) . Following a single 3-hour fl ight between Hong Kong and Beijing that included an ill passenger who later died of SARS, confi rmed or probable SARS developed in 18 of 120 passengers.
