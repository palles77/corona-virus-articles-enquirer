The \"2007 diagnostic criteria for gonorrhoea in China\" indicated, 15 people who were tested positive for gonorrhoea with or without symptoms could be diagnosed with gonorrhoea. This document recommended Gram stain and isolate culture to test NG. Before sampling the urethral swab of a male patient, urination was not allowed at least 2 h. For male patient with symptoms, secrete can be collected using swabs. For an asymptomatic male patient, samples can be collected by placing swabs in urethra for 10-15 seconds. For a female patient, samples can be collected by placing swabs in cervix for 20-30s. Samples can also be obtained by massaging perineal and dip in secrete using swabs. Male patients without complications can be diagnosed conclusively with gonorrhoea with a positive Gram stain microscopy result; the diagnosis of male patients with complications and female patients should be based on the confirmation of NG-isolated culture. NG is a very fastidious organism and will perish if not kept in ideal circumstances. The laboratory conditions and the ability of workers would affect the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for gonorrhoea has enabled significant implementation since 2002, creating opportunities for more rapid and accurate gonorrhoea diagnosis. 16 It has been demonstrated NAATs has a higher sensitivity and specificity than culture and microscopy for gonorrhoea test. 17 However, this method has recently limited use in some of the big cities in China, due to its high cost and technical requirements. The Guideline for Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Diseases of China, 18 which was published in 2014, has regarded this method as one of the recommendatory methods to test NG, which has been adopted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",

The problem occurred in the process of seeking healthcare in clinics, diagnosis, and case report to CISDCP. First, the physician should believe that the patient has a risk of infection and suggest to the patient to get an NG test done. Second, the patient should accept the physician's suggestion and get the NG test done. Third, the patient got a true positive result. Finally, the physician confirmed that the patient had NG infection, and reported this case to CISDCP. It is possible that the physician did not give the test suggestion, or that the patient was unwilling to get the NG test done, and the false-positive results may also be got by patients. The physician may also have forgotten to report the diagnosed gonorrhoea cases to CISDCP on time. In these instances, the information of these patients with gonorrhoea cannot be obtained from CISDCP. Moreover, some of the individuals may get a false-positive test result and be reported to CISDCP even though they do not have NG infection. The widespread use of CISDCP has underscored the importance of ensuring its accuracy. The discrepancies in symptoms and test methods between males and females may even lead to a different degree of accuracy of male and female reported gonorrhoea incidence.",

To the best of our knowledge, the impact of influence factors in the clinical diagnosis and the reporting process on the reported gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio has not as yet been quantified. It is helpful to find the weakness of disease surveillance system by identifying the influence factors of sex ratio. Thus, we designed and applied a patient survey questionnaire to collect information for gender and sociodemographic characteristics, and collected reporting data of gonorrhoea cases. Furthermore, we performed NG testing on all participants to ascertain gonorrhoea diagnosis. We used rates of untested patients, true-positive rate, false-negative rate and unreported rate to quantify the accuracy of the reported gonorrhoea incidence during diagnosis and the reporting process. Finally, we calculated and compared the reported gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio with the true diagnosis sex ratio, and devised strategies to resolve these discrepancies.",

After finishing the above procedures, the participant would continue their normal medical service. The clinic physicians then decided on whether or not to collect a second specimen and test for NG in clinics according to their typical diagnostic practices and experiences. Patients with a positive diagnosis of gonorrhoea (according to the second gonorrhoea test result) from the clinics were reported to CISDCP online within 6 or 12 h. The staff at SCCDC compared the original clinical records and reported case information in CISDCP to calculate the unreported rate at the end of the survey.",

We found that females were more likely to be untested, get false-negative results in the clinical process, and have a higher proportion of being unreported to CISDCP.

First, health policymakers may not be aware of the true prevalence and severity of the NG epidemic leading to an inadequate allocation of resources. Second, the inaccurately reported data may lead physicians and public health doctors to put more efforts into screening male patients versus female patients. Third, untreated NG infection can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, or even infertility and ectopic pregnancy in females. This contributes a large part to the disease burden across the world, especially in developing countries. 1 Moreover, these undiagnosed cases could become a hidden reservoir of gonorrhoea infection and lead to a much more serious spread of the disease. In recent years, drug-resistant NG has been increasingly common due to the irregular use and abuse of antibiotics. 20 'Superbugs', which are resistant to ceftriaxone, have been found in several countries since being identified in Japan in 2011.",

As Liu et al 21 found in Hefei city (the capital of Anhui province, China), 82% of patients with gonorrhoea could be identified by clinic laboratories, which was much higher than that in our research. Maybe the different study site and research design have led to the difference in results. Laboratory testing for NG is the key point to find new gonorrhoea cases, especially for asymptomatic infections. Cases reported to CISDCP should be detected positive for gonorrhoea. NG test should be conducted for asymptomatic patients. The current 'Diagnostic criteria for gonorrhea' of China, which were implemented from 15 October 2007 and recommended microscopy and culture to test NG, have a large impact on the appearance of gender difference. Compared to culture, microscopy is quick and the result can be obtained in minutes. On the other hand, culture methods usually require 2-7 days (depending on the hospital) to obtain results. 22 A large number of female patients are unwilling to take such a long time to get an NG test result. Therefore, when female patients present with mild symptoms or non-specific symptoms and seek medical service in a hospital, physicians may opt for empirical antibiotic treatment instead of an NG test. By then, many female patients lost the opportunity to be detected, which explains why female patients have a higher untested rate in our study. Besides that, Gram stain has a relatively low sensitivity (around 70% in China), while NG culture has a relative high sensitivity (80-95% in China). 23 However, culture methods have a high potential for human error. When collecting the sample, NG specimens are easily contaminated by other bacteria and die after separation from the host, 24 leading to many false negatives. These differences in laboratory and clinical diagnosis of gonorrhoea are likely to have contributed to the underestimation of male and female cases and an inflated male-to-female ratio. Moreover, the inadequate responsibility of the physician and ability of laboratory personnel also have a negative impact on the accuracy of gender difference of reported gonorrhoea incidence.",
