The majority of cases were \"found dead\" or died after a sudden onset pneumonia of less than 24h duration. Lesions of exudative bronchopneumonia were present and the cases could be divided into two main groups on the basis ofhistopathological and immunocytochemical features. In group A, cases were dominated by necrotizing bronchiolitis, degeneration and necrosis of airway and alveolar exudates, severe alveolitis with accumulations of degenerate basophilic cells, interstitial inflammatory changes and the widespread distribution ofH. somnus antigen in airways and alveoli. In Group B, necrotizing and degenerative changes were much less extensive and less severe and the overall appearance was of suppurative bronchopneumonia with H. somnus antigen much less widespread within the lungs. Alveolar oedema, hyaline membrane formation and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia were present in caudodorsal lung areas of several calves. No major differences were seen between the histopathology of lungs where H. somnus was' the sole isolate and that of lungs where H. somnus was isolated along with other bacterial pathogens.",

In Britain, the first recorded isolation of H. somnus was by Pritchard and MacLeod (1977) , who recovered the organism from pneumonic lesions in an unweaned singlesuckled calf. Two years later, Roberts, Wood, Hunter and Munro (1979) recorded the isolation of H. somnus from severe exudative bronchopneumonia lesions in a calf which died suddenly in a beef unit during an outbreak of thrombo-embolic meningo-encephalitis. Neither of these reports included histopathological descriptions of lung lesions and there has been little further information on naturally occurring respiratory disease associated with H. somnus infection in the U.K. At our laboratory, H. somnus has been isolated from pneumonic calf lungs with increasing fi'equency in recent years.",

In Group A, cases were dominated by necrotizing bronchiolitis, degeneration and necrosis of airway and alveolar exudates, severe alveolitis with accumulations of degenerate basophilic cells, interstitial inflammatory changes and widespread distribution of H. somnus in airways and alveoli. In Group B, necrotizing and degenerative changes were much less extensive and severe and the overall appearance was of suppurative bronchopneumonia with 1-1. somnus antigen much less widespread within the lungs. In Group A (22 cases) bronchitis and bronchiolitis were present with a major part of bronchiolar exudates consisting of degenerate pyknotic cells with very basophilic nuclei (Figs 1 and 2 ). Some exudate cells were mononuclear, but many were degenerate neutrophils. Necrotizing bronchiolitis was seen in all 22 cases, ranging from focal or multifocal necrosis of bronchiolar mucosa to extensive transmural necrosis with infiltration of necrotic walls by degenerate leucocytes (Fig. 2) . Fibrin-rich oedema fluid with entrapped leucocytes filled alveoli, frequently forming strongly eosinophilic proteinaceous casts within lumina (Fig. 1) . Alveolar cellular infiltration was extensive and consisted of diffuse accumulations of macrophages (Fig. 3) and occasional giant cells, multifocal aggregates of neutrophils and mononuclear cells in the early stages of degeneration and multifocal accumulations of degenerate basophilic cells within which greyish blanched nuclei were prominent (Fig. 4) . Such aggregates of basophilic cells were frequently seen in alveoli, peripheral to necrotic bronchioles or alveolar ducts. Areas of fibrinous pneumonia were also seen where alveoli packed with degenerate basophilic cells encircled a central region of fibrin-rich alveolar oedema and necrosis. Alveolar capillaries were frequently congested and thrombi were also evident. Variable degrees of cellular thickening and pneumocyte proliferation were seen in alveolar septa. In a minority of lobules the pattern was of purulent bronchopneumonia with minimal degeneration of exudate.",

Most commonly, the lesions ranged from purulent bronchopneumonia with minimal necrosis to severe necrotizing bronchiolitis, degeneration and necrosis of airway and alveolar exudates, vasculitis and severe interstitial inflammation. Many of these lesions have been induced by experimental infections with H. somnus (Gogolewski et al., 1987; Jackson et al., 1987; Potgieter et al., 1988) .

(1985) suggested that H. somnus was more likely to be isolated from subacute to chronic bronchopneumonias in calves rather than from acute fibrinous pneumonias. In the present study, two thirds of the submissions were \"found dead\" or died after acute pneumonia of hours duration. Nevertheless, histopathological examination revealed that, in the majority of cases, pulmonary repair accompanied acute inflammatory changes. This indicated that some lung damage, albeit subclinical, had been present for at least several days. Whether H. somnus had initiated lung damage in many, any or all of the cases in the present study cannot be stated with certainty. What can be said is that in none of these cases was there evidence of an underlying, well recognized, primary pneumonia such as respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia, parainfluenza 3 virus pneumonia, \"cuffing pneumonia\" or husk. Experimental evidence indicates that prior infection with RSV significantly enhances H. sornnus-induced respiratory disease (Potgieter et al., 1988) . In the present study RSV antigen was not demonstrable by immunofluorescence staining in any of the calves at the time of death, although this does not preclude the possibility of an earlier infection. BVD virus, which was demonstrable in four cases, has been shown experimentally to enhance the severity ofP. haemolytica pneumonia (Potgieter, McCracken, Hopkins, Walker and Guy, 1984) .",

Suppurative bronchopneumonia occurs in experimentally induced H. somnus pneumonia (Jackson el al., 1987) and might be caused by endotoxin or exotoxins acting extracellularly and not detected by the present immunoperoxidase system. Experimentally, lesions offibrinopurulent inflammation, oedema and haemorrhage have been induced in sheep lung following local deposition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria (Brogden, Cutlip and Lehmkuhl, 1984) . Findings from the present study suggest that a significant component of H. somnus pathology is induced by extracellular bacterial factors acting at considerable distances from bacterial cells.",

Findings in the present study were comparable. Within alveoli, large aggregates of bacterial antigen were most commonly seen amidst basophilic degenerate cells, many of which were originally macrophages and neutrophils. In the present study, H. somnus antigen was also demonstrable within airway exudates, within the cytoplasm of intact alveolar macrophages, in the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells within airway lumina and, in a minority of cases, within the cytoplasm of airway epithelial cells. Intra-epithelial location of H. somnus antigen has not previously been described. In vitro studies have suggested that infected bovine mononuclear phagocytes can sustain H. somnus infections (Lederer, Brown and Czuprynski, 1987) . Possibly, localization of/_/. somnus antigen in epithelial cells and macrophages might result in chronic persistent infections in vivo.",

Similar lesions have been described in this location in calves with acute exudative interstitial pneumonia, attributed to Pasteurella species, in cranioventral parts of their lungs (Wiseman, Selman, Pirie and Harvey, 1976) and in calves with RSV pneumonia in cranioventral lobes (Kimman, Straver and Zimmer, 1989 ). In the latter study, severe interstitial emphysema was also present. Kimman, Terpstra, Daha and Westernbrink (1989) attributed such lesions in RSV pneumonia cases to the activity of biologically active complement fragments, such as C3a, C5a and anaphylotoxins, generated by complement activation by RSV-infected cells in cranioventral portions of the lung, and exerting their effect in the caudodorsal lung, both directly on airway and vascular smooth muscle and also indirectly, by release of mast cell mediators. No evidence of current RSV lung infection could be detected in the present study. It is possible that complement activation with generation ofanaphylotoxins might occur in association with bacterial activity in the cranioventral lung portion. In feedlot cattle in the U.S.A. a significant association had been noted between the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, in which lesions of congestion and oedema, hyaline membrane formation, alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and emphysema become extensive, and pre-existing lesions of bacterial bronchopneumonia (of unspecified aetiology) in the same lungs (Hjerpe, 1983) .",
