Recombinant fusion proteins comprised of pgsA and neucleocapsid protein of PEDV were stably expressed in Lactobacillus casei. Surface location of fusion protein was verified by ELISA, immunofluoresence microscopy. Oral and intranasal inoculations of recombinant L. casei into pregnant sow and mice resulted in high levels of serum immunoglobuline G (IgG) and mucosal IgA, as demonstrated by rnELISA(recombinant N protein ELISA) using recombinant N protein. Absorbance of IgG in pregnant sow sera highly increased duration of the experiment. More importantly, the level of IgA in colostrum were increased significantly higher than that of IgG. The IgG levels of the piglets were increased after suckling colostrum secreted from sows previously inoculated recombinant L. casei. These results indicate that mucosal immunization with recombinant L. casei expressing PEDV N protein (neucleoprotein of PEDV) on its surface elicited high levels of mucosal IgA and circulation IgG immune responses against the antigen N of PEDV.",

            "text": "Bacterial cells present an attractive approach for recombinant vaccines because of their easiness of use and low costs of manufacturing and distribution. Displaying foreign antigens on the surface of bacteria may facilitate their recognition by the immune system, and mediate an immunoadjuvant effect with other bacterial surface components. The delivery of antigens to mucosal-associated lymphoid-tissues in paediatric and immune compromised populations by safe, non-invasive vectors, such as commensal lactobacilli, represents a crucial improvement to prevailing vaccination options [1] . However, most surface display systems for vaccine applications are limited in the size of foreign antigens they can display. In addition, surface display of antigens has been demonstrated. Coronaviruses are members of a family of RNA viruses that cause different pathologies in humans and animals. An important aspect of study is the finding of efficient antiviral strategies that could prevent the considerable economic losses caused by these infectious agents all over the world. Several viral proteins are important for inducing an immune response to coronaviruses: the spike protein (S), the membrane protein (M) and the nucleoprotein (N) [2] . The S glycoprotein of coronavirus envelope plays a crucial role in the early steps of infection. It mediates binding of the virus to the cell surface and the subsequent fusion between the viral and cell membranes [3] . Because the diseases caused by coronavirus continue to cause major economic losses to swine industry, and to date effective vaccines or treatments have remained elusive, there is a demand for the development of a new type of vaccine against PEDV.",

The goal is to provide the first line of defense by effectively eliminating pathogens at the mucosal surface. But surface display of antigens on the bacterial surface has been problematic because large antigens perturb membrane topology.

We adopted pgsA protein derived from the pgsBCA enzyme complex of B. subtilis isolated from chung-kook-jang (a traditional Korean soybean paste used as a food additive). To investigate the feasibility of using lactic acid bacteria as a carrier of immunogenic peptides to mucosal immune system, we immunized mice intranasally and orally and pregnant sow orally with L. casei anchoring neucleocapsid proteins of PEDV. Although the amount of fusion PEDN proteins expressed on the surface of L. casei was not very higher than PEDN expressed in E. coli (data not shown), oral and intranasal immunization of swine and mice with these recombinant L. casei resulted in systemic and local immune responses. Mucosal delivery of vaccines induces mucosal immunity more efficiently than parenteral immunization [15] . The surfaces of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, which are not covered by skin, are referred to as mucosa [16] . In total, the mucosa covers an area that is about 200 times larger than the skin. This large area is not as resistant to penetration as the skin, because it is often limited by a thin epithelial layer without keratinization. A number of pathogens initiate infection through the mucosal surfaces. The mucosal surfaces, particularly the respiratory and digestive tracts, are exposed daily to a wide variety of foreign organisms and antigens. In addition, immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the primary immunoglobulin isotype induced at the mucosal surface. Secretory IgA (sIgA) in mucosal secretions provides protection against bacterial and viral pathogens and neutralization microbial toxins [17] . Thus, they must be very effective in dealing with the large amounts of foreign antigens. The most important part of the immediate defence against pathogens in the mucosa is the innate immune system. The mucosa and associated lymphoid tissue are an attractive target for vaccine strategies, because they harbor the early stages of infection [8] . The nasal cavity is already established as a potential alternative to the parenteral route for administering peptide antigens and drugs. Nasal administration of antigens could produce effectives for the protection of upper respiratory tract and other distant mucosal sites, as well as systemic immunity [18, 19, [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

            "text": "Protection against neonatal infectious agents such as TGEV and PEDV is currently best obtained by passive immunization of piglets after induction of colostral antibodies in the sow [24, 25, 26] . Colostral antibodies can be induced by the oral delivery of protective antigens activating the gut-associated lymphoid-tissues (GALT) of sows [27, 26] . For this purpose, pregnant sow were orally administrated with recombinant L. casei before farrowing. The higher IgA levels in these sow colostrum were detected by PEDN ELISA, although their IgG levels were relatively lower. Furthermore, the piglets sucked these colostrum were showed a certain extent IgG level. Since swine are born without immunoglobulins, immunoprotection for newborn piglets mainly consists of passive immunity through colostral immunoglobulins from immunized dam [28] . Thus, passive immunity from colostrum is of primary important in piglets for protection against infectious enteric diseases. But protect immunity need to further research for virus challenge. Parenteral immunization is highly effective in protecting against systemic infection, in part due to the production of circulating IgG and its transudation into many extravascular sites, especially during inflammatory processes. However, parenteral immunization can fail to protect against invasion of mucosa. This failure is attributable to insufficient IgG transudation into mucosal secretions and the inability of systemic immunogen presentation to induce mucosal IgA production, the principal isotype present in external secretions. In contrast, mucosal immunization elicits both mucosal IgA and circulating IgG [29] . On mucosal surface, IgA represents a first line of defence by neutralizing invading pathogens [30] . Our observation support the concept of a mucosal immune system in which mucosally situated IgA and IgG plasma cell progenitors are stimulated selectively by mucosal immunization and predict that mucosal immunization can provoke both mucosal and circulating antibody responses better than parenteral immunization [29] .",

In this study, we still constructed S1 gene of PEDV in L. casei, but the level of its expression on the surface of L. case was much lower than that of N gene (data not shown). Considering that the S protein as a major target for the development of animal coronavirus vaccine [5, 33] , a vaccine that can induce mucosal immunity will include the S protein. In this regard, additional studies will be needed to further research to solve some problems on the S expression. For a successful immune response against an antigen, it is necessary that the antigen is present in sufficient quantities and in a form that can be recognized by antigen presenting cells of immune system. Moreover, not every gene can be expressed efficiently in host organism. Expression systems and experimental approaches are useful for overproduction of proteins. The results of our study at least indicate that the pgsA protein is capable of presenting foreign epitopes (size 1 kb or so) to the immune system and its recombinant fusion proteins on the surface of lactic acid bacteria can induce a specific anti-foreign epitope immune response after oral or intranasal administration. Furthermore, the pgsA-based chimeric surface display system expressed by L. casei can be optimized by using optical promoter. The immunogenicity of N antigens expressed by such strains may present significant opportunities for PEDV vaccine development.",

By combining the knowledge generated in the different disciplines, molecular biology, immunology, ecology and gastroenterology, even more progress is expected to be made towards an understanding of the underlying principles of oral immunization and the importance of live bacterial carriers therein [32] . The elucidation and characterization at the DNA level of bacterial surface proteins involved in adherence to mucosal tissues has provided new and challenging opportunities which allow us to better understand the interaction between intestinal Lactobacilli and mucosal tissues. The recent development of molecular biological techniques that permit construction of lactic acid bacteria presenting foreign antigens in different of the immune system, offers for the first time opportunities to further explore the potential of these safe food bacteria as vaccine vehicles [9] .",
