            "text": "The leading methods for ultra high-throughput DNA sequencing fall into two main categories; sequencing by hybridization (6) and sequencing by synthesis (5, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Sequencing by hybridization is an extension of well established DNA microarray techniques that essentially aim to identify all subsequences of a specific length within a genome via their hybridization to presynthesized probes. Sequencing by synthesis utilizes a process by which nucleotides are added in a controlled fashion to isolate DNA templates. Each nucleotide is read in turn; each base being added and then read in a cyclic process. Both of these approaches produce sequence information in very short segments compared to conventional Sanger sequencing. For sequencing by hybridization the length of each fragment of sequence information (the 'read length') is limited by the length of the probe. Probes cannot be extended much beyond 30 nt as the selectivity for perfect matches over single mismatches drops to unacceptable levels (12) . In the case of sequencing by synthesis obtainable read length is proportional to cycle efficiency. However the technical challenges involved in this approach mean that the length of useful sequence that can be obtained is limited. Solexa Ltd, have recently claimed reads of 25 nt with sufficient throughput to re-sequence the viral genome of f X174 (http:// www.solexa.com/news/2005/100305.htm). Another promising technique is the high throughput pyrosequencing approach of 454 Life Sciences who are currently reporting read lengths of 100 nt (13) .",

            "text": "A key problem for these sequencing methodologies is that as the length of each individual read decreases, the probability that a read will occur more than once in the sequence increases. The problems that repetitions can cause for sequencing projects based on whole genome shotgun approaches, where the read length is as short as 500 nt, have recently been analysed in detail (14) . There has been much debate concerning the minimum length of read required to generate useful sequence information (3). However, despite the importance of this analysis for the utility of many proposed ultra highthroughput sequencing methods, little work has been reported on the analysis or reassembly of sequence information from very short reads. Perhaps the most significant contribution to this area has been that of Chaisson et al. (15) who discusses the limitations of short read sequencing with read lengths starting at 70 nt, the largest genome analysed (Neisseria meningitidis) is 2 Mb. In contrast to this, here we describe an analysis for read lengths between 18 The online version of this article has been published under an open access model.

Using the algorithms developed for RepAnalyse to process the suffix array we are able to produce the analysis shown far faster than with traditional techniques.

We consider all possible reads of length l in the genome. Each read is compared with every other read of the same length and all reads that occur only once are counted. The uniqueness for read length l is then given by U l \u00bc n u,l /n p,l , where n u,l and n p,l are the number of unique and possible reads, respectively. We have analysed the uniqueness of reads of all lengths in several model genomes. In Figure 1 we show two representative examples, a viral genome; l-phage (GenBank accession no. NC_001416 size: 48 kb) and a bacterial genome, Escherichia coli (K12 MG1655, accession no. NC_000913 size: 4.6 Mb). In both cases uniqueness has an approximately sigmoidal dependence on read length. This closely follows the behaviour of randomly generated sequences of the same size. The position of the rise in the E.coli genome is at higher read length, largely due to the increased sequence length and therefore higher probability that any given sub-sequence will repeat. The most pronounced difference between the data for E.coli and l-phage is that uniqueness in the bacterial genome reaches a plateau at around 97% from where the value then rises only very slowly. For instance while 97% of 18 nt reads are unique, a read length of 475 nt is required for 99% of reads to be unique. This plateau is a result of repeated segments such as the seven copies of the genes that code for ribosomal proteins and RNA and frequently repeated intergenic sequences such as Intergenic Repeat Unit (IRUs) and Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERICs) (21) . Our analysis of the whole human genome shows a similar pattern, with a plateau being reached at a higher read length (Figure 2a) .",

Re-sequencing by hybridization using probes of around 25 nt is now a reasonably well established technology and has been reported for the SARS Coronavirus (22) . Other viral genomes we have analysed show similar trends (data not shown). As the genome is very short and contains very few repeats it is also possible to reassemble the genome of l-phage phage from short reads. Our analysis shows that it is possible to completely reassemble the genome from 18 nt reads and that 17 nt reads can cover 99.6% of the genome with contigs larger than 10 000 nt. Below this read length, coverage falls dramatically. This confirms and extends the result of Chaisson et al.

And indicates that de novo sequencing of genomes of viral size should be well within the limitations of short read methods. The results on de novo sequencing show that, in principle at least, it is possible to sequence these genomes without any prior knowledge. However, highly repetitive elements can be found in specific viral genomes which will increase the read length required in these cases. It should also be noted that when sequencing a viral population it will not be possible to determine individual genome variability without first isolating that individual sequence.",

            "text": "The uniqueness and reassembly analysis of the bacterial genome of E.coli K12 MG1655 show one main difference to that of both the viral genome and randomly generated sequences. While 97% of the genome can be unambiguously probed by reads of 17 nt (Figure 1b ) the remaining 3% is ambiguous for much longer read lengths. This difference between the bacterial and viral genome sequences is a result of much more repetition of both large (kilobases) and small (20-200 nt) sequences in the E.coli sequence. The plateau in E.coli uniqueness suggests that, for bacterial genomes, once a threshold read length has been reached ( 17 nt for E.coli) further increases in read length will not provide a significant increase in the quality of information. This indicates that for bacterial genomes, methodologies that can provide reads of 18 nt or more are adequate for re-sequencing. However, it is important to note that specific bacterial genomes may contain highly repetitive elements which will increase the required read length. Sequencing by hybridization and other high-throughput methods can provide this information so the expansion of existing methods for re-sequencing viral genomes will provide sufficient data for re-sequencing most of a given bacterial genome. Analysis of the reassembly of the E.coli genome show that with a read length of 20 nt, over 98% of the genome can be re-assembled into contigs larger than 100 nt, and 91% into contigs larger than 1000 nt. However, only 10% is covered by contigs larger than 10 000 nt. At this read length over 75% of genes are entirely covered by a single contig. A read length of 30 nt improves the coverage for 10 000 nt contigs significantly to 75%, with over 96% of genes entirely covered by a single contig, this rises to 90 and 98%, respectively at a 50 nt read length. De novo sequencing of 90-97% of the E.coli genome into gene-sized contigs is therefore possible with reads of around 50 nt and a significant portion can be reconstructed with much shorter read lengths. This compares well with the result of Chaisson et al. (15) where it was found that a 70 nt read length would allow 93.4 and 99.5% of bacterial genomes (Campylobacter jejuni, 1.6 Mb and N meningitidis, 2.1 Mb accession nos: CJ11168X1 and NMA1Z2491) to be reconstructed into contigs of 1000 nt and greater.",

Uniqueness also plateaus earlier and continues to rise faster with reads of 20 nt able to probe 80% of the chromosome and 35 nt required for 90% coverage. Other human chromosomes we have analysed show a similar pattern (data not shown) where the rate of increase after the plateau has been reached being dependent on the size of the chromosome. Figure 2b shows the analysis of a simulated reassembly of a complete set of reads obtained from chromosome 1. The analysis shows that with reads of 50 nt it is possible to reassemble 80% of the chromosome into contigs larger than 1000 nt; 17% is covered by contigs larger than 10 000 nt. Even with relatively modest read lengths of 25-30 nt significant proportions of chromosome 1 can be reassembled into contigs of 1000 to 10 000 nt. With a 500 nt read length 98.4% of the chromosome maybe reassembled into contigs larger than 10 000 nt. Figure 5 gives an example of how contigs obtained by reassembling reads from a single chromosome cover a region of interest in the human genome. The reassembly of contigs from a complete set of 25, 50 and 100 nt reads of chromosome 17 was simulated. Figure 5 shows how these contigs cover the BRCA1 (25) gene, implicated in susceptibility to breast cancer. As can be seen the majority of exons are covered at a 50 nt read length, while 25 nt produces significantly less coverage. Using a 100 nt read length, two contigs are constructed which cover all of the exons in this gene. While contigs assembled from 50 nt reads cover the majority of the gene they cannot be positioned without additional information. However the fact that 87.5% of exons are covered by contigs of 200 nt or larger suggests that by using mapping information it should be possible to reconstruct the majority of the coding sequences in the genome. The efficient use of mapping information [such as matepair sequence data used to build 'scaffolds' by the Celera assembler (26) ] is therefore an important area for future investigation.",

For the re-sequencing of bacterial genomes, once a threshold read length is reached, increasing the read length yields only small gains. De novo sequencing of a large proportion of the E.coli genome is possible with read lengths of 20-50 nt.

The challenge for the future is to identify in detail the effect of different potential experimental errors and to work to eliminate those that have the most detrimental effect on data quality so as to approach the upper bounds identified here. Our key finding is that with high quality data and currently available read lengths significant amounts of useful data can be obtained both by using a template sequence and for de novo sequencing.
