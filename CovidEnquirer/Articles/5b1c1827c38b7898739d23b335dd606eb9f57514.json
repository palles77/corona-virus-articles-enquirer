Such panels should be as informative as possible and permit error detection and error correction for assays of the human gene in the various clones. We derive estimates of the number of randomly generated clones required to be reasonably confident of accurately and unambiguously assigning a gene to a particular human chromosome. The collection of clones in such a random panel is contrasted with minimal panels suggested by algebraic coding theory. To approximate minimal panels we suggest the method of simulated annealing for selecting small, informative panels from larger existing collections of clones. These theoretical insights emphasize the need for more collaboration and coordination among gene mapping groups so that optimal clone panels can be assembled, stored, and distributed.",

A few generations after fusion, clones can be identified with stable subsets of the human chromosomes. All chromosomes, human and rodent, normally remain functional. With a broad enough collection of different hybrid clones, it is possible to establish a correspondence between the presence or absence of a given human gene and the presence or absence of each of the 24 distinct human chromosomes. From this pattern one can infer the particular chromosome on which the gene resides. With the above outline in mind, it is of interest to determine the minimal number of distinct hybrid clones required to accurately and unambiguously assign a gene to a particular human chromosome. Such collections or panels of hybrid clones ideally should be designed to detect and correct a small number of errors in assays for the human gene or its protein product. By using some ideas from algebraic coding theory and probability, we contrast such minimal panels with the random panels typically generated by molecular geneticists.",

            "text": "Although assumption (a) is generally satisfied, a few human genes are scattered at multiple dispersed sites within the human genome; the gene encoding ribosomal RNA is a case in point [9] . Assumption (b) can be fulfilled if the human gene G and its rodent analogue are distinguishable by either electrophoresis of their gene products or by hybridization of an appropriate human DNA probe. Assumption (c) is easily met because human chromosomes can be accurately identified by a combination of human specific isozyme marker assays and karyotypic analysis using standard banding procedures. Violations of this condition usually result from the presence of unrecognized chromosomal aberrations such as insertions, deletions, translocations, and fragmentations. However, such chromosome aberrations are often intentionally employed for the regional mapping of genes on a specific chromosome. Assumption (d) can be violated if some of the cells in a clone continue to undergo human chromosome loss. For this reason several cells from a clone should be karyotyped. It is the maximal subset of human chromosomes in the clone which is relevant to gene localization. As a safeguard, ambiguous clones should be disregarded. The last assumption, (e), causes the most trouble. For instance, ambiguities can arise when phenotypic polymorphism in structural genes cannot be distinguished from phenotypic polymorphism in associated regulatory genes [6] . In addition, not all genes are constitutive in the sense that they are expressed at all times in all cell types [32] . Use of DNA probes to detect the human gene neatly circumvents both of these problems. Finally, laboratory error can enter into both enzyme and probe hybridization assays. The method of in situ hybridization carries the technique of human probe hybridization one step further. If a human cell is karyotyped and radioactive grains corresponding to the hybridized probe cluster predominantly on a given chromosome, then the gene is declared to reside on that chromosome. In practice, the independent results of somatic cell hybridization and in situ hybridization tend to reinforce each other [22] . In the current paper we will be concerned solely with issues of redundancy and efficiency in the somatic cell hybrid method. It has long been appreciated that certain redundancies in panels of somatic cell hybrid clones can self-detect and self-correct phenotyping errors representing violations of assumption (e) [17] . We will attempt to explain the utility of these error detection and correction capabilities as well as the amount of effort necessary to generate at random panels of clones for such purposes. These randomly generated panels we contrast with minimal panels suggested by algebraic coding theory. We also provide a practical solution to the combinatorial problem of selecting small, informative panels from larger existing collections of clones. As examples, we select good panels of sizes 5 through 20 clones from 189 published clones.",

Let n denote the number of distinct hybrid clones in a panel. Since in females the 22 autosomes and the X chromosome occur in homologous pairs, and since the Y chromosome bears few genes of interest, we focus on clones derived from human female cells. We may construct a karyotype matrix K consisting of n rows and 23 columns. The entry in row i and column j of K is 1 if clone i contains chromosome j; otherwise it is 0. See Figure 1 for an example. Note that the X chromosome Besides comparing columns of K, it is appropriate to compare the columns of K with the results of testing for a given gene G in the different hybrid clones. We can construct a phenotype wlur~ vector p whose ith entry is 1 when the ith hybrid clone contains G; otherwise it is 0. From the assumptions (a) through (e) of the introduction, G can reside on chromosome r only if p = cr. If c, is distinct from all other columns of K, then G can be assigned to chromosome r. In terms of the Hamming distance, this is equivalent to the two conditions p(p, c,) = 0 and p(c,, c,) > 0 for all s # r. As the number n of randomly generated clones increases, satisfying these two conditions for unique chromosome assignment becomes more likely.",

The matrix K in Figure 1 furnishes some examples. The first five rows alone permit correct gene placement in the absence of errors, since all columns are distinct. In fact, these columns just represent the binary expansions of various numbers between 0 and 31. The first six rows of Figure 1 have all column pairs a distance 2 or more apart. Hence, these six rows permit detection of one error regardless of which chromosome G lies on. The sixth row was constructed by forcing the column sums of the first six rows to be even. The pairwise column distances for the whole matrix in Figure 1 are always at least 3. Hence, all nine rows permit the correction of a single phenotyping error. There are no simple algorithms to construct this and more complicated examples, but many such matrices have been published in the coding theory literature [27, 36, 421. The karyotype matrix in Figure 1 has much better error detecting and correcting properties than most random karyotype matrices of the same size.

Simulated annealing is motivated by the observation that a liquid cooled very slowly from a high temperature to a low temperature will crystallize in a state of minimum energy. To implement simulated annealing a parameter T analogous to temperature is gradually reduced to 0. The objective function E to be minimized is termed energy. In the present context simulated annealing can be realized as follows: Suppose a current panel with energy El exists. Generate a new random panel with energy E2 by the exchange step. Move to this new panel if E2 Q El. If E2 > E,, then move to the new panel with the Boltzmann probability exp [ -(E, -E,) /T]. As T tends to 0, this probability tends to 0 also. Thus, fewer and fewer unfavorable steps are taken as T approaches 0. As with the other two algorithms, a record is kept of the best panel encountered.",

Table 3 lists an appropriate identification code for each clone. We have omitted duplicate clones found in more than one reference and clones having ambiguous human chromosome complements. Table 4 presents the best panels resulting from the application of the three algorithms. The total number of iterations for each panel size ranged from 55,000 to 75,000 and was determined by the convergence criterion for simulated annealing. See [28] for a detailed description of how simulated annealing is implemented. Listed in Table 4 are the panel composition, the minimum Hamming distance, and the number of pairs of columns attaining this distance. Table 4 makes it clear that random sampling is not a contender for panel design. The best panels are relatively rare and can only be identified by some type of directed search. Both the random downhill algorithm and simulated annealing produce excellent panels. Simulated annealing performs better, particularly for panel sixes n -12, 17, and 19. In these three cases the best simulated annealing panels have a higher minimum Hamming distance than the best random downhill panels. As expected, random downhill typically achieved its best panels in relatively few iterations, whereas simulated annealing often attained its best panels in the final stages of simulation.",

The average n when panels are randomly generated is 25.3, with a standard deviation of 2.6. In other words, by pooling clones one is able to reach the level d = 6 much sooner than by assembling a sequence of panels from clones which are randomly generated one after another. Note that when d = 6, up to five assay errors can be detected and up to two can be corrected.",

For all practical purposes, it is clear that as the number of clones in a panel increases, the chance of correctly mapping a given gene also increases. Yet it is hardly economical to use large randomly constructed panels when small purposely designed ones will suffice. Even in the context of purely randomly generated panels, Figure 2 demonstrates a phenomenon of diminishing returns in adding further clones to an existing panel of hybrids. It is our contention that current laboratory practice encourages the use of random panels with two many hybrid clones.",

By applying some simple concepts from algebraic coding theory, rational construction of panels is feasible. We have focused on the minimum Hamming distance for a panel as a measure of its discriminatory power. Selection of nearly optimal panels by this criterion from existing collections of clones is practical using random sampling techniques and results in panels which are uniformly good for all chromosomes. The alternative of choosing good panels by visual inspection is not practical. Once again the method of simulated annealing has proved its versatility. Two other applications of simulated annealing in genetics appear in [13] and [40] . We conjecture that the combinatorial optimization problem of panel design is intrinsically hard in the precise technical sense of being NP-complete [12] . For problems of this category, like the traveling salesman problem, simulated annealing offers a practical, easy to implement approximate solution [3] .",

Besides being more efficient, small panels with the same information content as large panels can actually reduce the number of assay errors. More systematic design and distribution of panels will also enhance the proper cytogenetic characterization of clones within the best panels. In fact, the error detection and correction capabilities of a good panel permit careful monitoring of it for corrupted clones and clones experiencing continued chromosome loss. The panels in Table 4 are not meant to be definitive. Some of the clones represented may no longer be available or have stable chromosome complements. However, our techniques for achieving maximal panel redundancy with minimal panel size offer the opportunity to design and disseminate good panels regardless of exactly what clones are currently available.
