Peritoneal ventilation has long been desired for extrapulmonary oxygenation owing to easy access of the peritoneal cavity for catheterization and the relative safety compared to an extracorporeal circuit. Unfortunately, prior attempts involving direct oxygen ventilation or aqueous perfusates of fluorocarbons or hemoglobin carriers have failed, leading many researchers to abandon the method. We attribute these prior failures to limited mass transfer of oxygen to the peritoneum and have designed an oxygen formulation that overcomes this limitation. Using phospholipid-coated oxygen microbubbles (OMBs), we demonstrate 100% survival for rats experiencing acute lung trauma to at least 2 h. In contrast, all untreated rats and rats treated with peritoneal oxygenated saline died within 30 min. For rats treated with OMBs, hemoglobin saturation and heart rate were at normal levels over the 2-h timeframe. Peritoneal oxygenation with OMBs was therefore shown to be safe and effective, and the method requires less equipment and technical expertise than initiating and maintaining an extracorporeal circuit. Further translation of peritoneal oxygenation with OMBs may provide therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome arising from trauma, sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration, burns and other pulmonary diseases.",

Peritoneal oxygenation uses the large surface area of the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity, as a gas exchanger. The main advantages of peritoneal oxygenation are easy access for catheterization; relative safety of circulating oxygen through the peritoneal cavity, in which the mesothelium acts as a gaspermeable barrier between the perfusate and the blood; and avoidance of extracting and reintroducing blood.

In a subsequent large animal study, however, peritoneal mechanical ventilation showed no increase in mixed venous PO 2 [14] .

The mixture was heated to 65 C and dispersed using a Branson 450 sonifier (Danbury, CT) with an output power of 5/10 until the solution was translucent. The resulting solution was stored in a refrigerator prior to microbubble synthesis. Oxygen microfoam was prepared by adapting the process design developed by Swanson et al. [22] for synthesizing large volumes of oxygen microbubbles. The process consisted of an ultrasonic horn reactor enclosed in a water-cooled, continuous-flow chamber (Branson, Danbury, CT). The lipid suspension was fed at 5 C and combined with room temperature oxygen gas in the reactor at roughly equal volumetric flow rates. The oxygen gas was emulsified at full sonication power and then fed to a flotation column to separate the oxygen microbubbles (bottom) from the macrofoam (top). Oxygen microbubbles were immediately collected from the bottom of the column using 60-mL syringes and centrifuged (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) at 110 relative centrifugal force (RCF) for 4 min to form a w70 vol% concentrate. The concentrated oxygen microfoam was then transferred to 500-mL Wheaton serum bottles (Pasadena, TX), sealed under an oxygen atmosphere, and stored in the refrigerator. The infranatant lipid suspension from the centrifugal wash was collected and recycled into the sonication process to produce more microfoam. The process was repeated until the desired volume of 70 vol% oxygen microfoam was produced. Oxygen microbubble size distribution was determined using the electrozone sensing method (Coulter Multisizer III, Beckman Coulter, Opa Locka, FL). Oxygen gas volume fraction was determined by subtracting the weight of a fixed volume of microfoam from the weight of the same volume of aqueous medium (10 mg/mL lipid in PBS), and dividing this difference by the weight of the same volume of aqueous medium. Gas headspace purity in the serum bottle was determined using a model 6600 precision headspace gas analyzer (Illinois Instruments Inc, Johnsburg, IL).",

            "text": "The objective of this study was to test our hypothesis that oxygen microbubbles delivered by intraperitoneal infusion can significantly increase the mean survival time of an animal experiencing acute lung injury, in comparison to an intraperitoneal infusion of oxygenated saline solution. The research subjects were male Wistar rats (n \u00bc 10, mass \u00bc 430 AE 15 g, Charles River), housed 2 per cage and acclimated for 4 days with free access to food and water. We performed a controlled laboratory study to test the therapeutic benefit of an intraperitoneal infusion of oxygen microbubbles in rats experiencing acute lung injury. Right pneumothorax was chosen as an appropriate model for acute lung injury based on prior work reported in the literature [20] . Two treatments were applied: oxygen microbubbles or oxygenated saline control. Following induction of pneumothorax, we observed vital signs and measured intraperitoneal pressure, infused volume, rectal temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ). The animals were randomly assigned to cages by the caretakers, and the animals were randomly chosen for treatments. No additional blinding was done in the study. The number of animals used in this study was determined from work by Matsutani et al. [20] and a preliminary feasibility study. In Matsutani, a synthetic oxygen carrier was injected into the intraperitoneal (IP) space of rats for the purpose of systemic oxygenation. The mean standard deviation and mean effective size were 6.9 and 19.9, respectively [20] . We assumed the same standard deviation, but half the effective size (m \u00c0 m 0 \u00bc 10). Using these values, a target Type I error of 0.05 and a sample size of 6 rats per group yielded a power of 0.81. In our preliminary feasibility study, a sample size of 4 rats was used in the oxygen microfoam group, and 3 rats were used in the control group. Using the Logrank test for comparison of the survival distribution (a \u00bc 0.05), a significant difference was found between the two groups (X 2 \u00bc 6.624, P \u00bc 0.010). Based on these results, it was decided that a sample size of 5 rats per group would be adequate for the lung injury study. Data collection was stopped due to either cardiac arrest or achievement of the primary endpoint. Additional criteria were established to allow for the exclusion of samples where complications arose. Criteria for exclusion included the occurrence of unsuccessful pneumothorax or infrequent data points being collected by the veterinary monitor. One rat from the control group was excluded from the study because both exclusion criteria occurred in the trial. No other data were excluded. No test for outliers was used; all data were included in the study. A primary endpoint of 2 h following induction of pneumothorax was selected to avoid complications arising from animal recovery from anesthesia and the initial lung injury. We sometimes observed these complications in animals living more than 2 h in our preliminary feasibility study. We calculated that the 2-h endpoint would be sufficiently long to demonstrate a statistically significant increase in mean survival time between animal receiving our therapy and the control group. Prior to our study, the longest mean survival time for an intraperitoneal oxygenation therapy following pneumothorax reported in the literature was w33 min [20] ; thus, a mean survival time exceeding 2 h was deemed a significant improvement over the current state of the art and of high clinical utility. No other endpoints were specified. No replicates were performed. Each animal received only one pneumothorax and one treatment.",

Male Wistar rats (n \u00bc 10, mass \u00bc 430 AE 15 g, Charles River) were anesthetized in an induction chamber with 5% isoflurane to effect and maintained on 2% isoflurane. Each rat was weighed, given an IP injection of sodium pentobarbital solution (50 mg/kg dose), and then placed in the supine position on a warming pad (T/pump Classic, Gaymar) set at 38 C to maintain body temperature. After the rat was fully sedated and unresponsive to pain delivered by paw pinches, a small incision into the skin was made to expose the fascia of the abdominal wall. A 12-gauge indwelling catheter was then inserted into the IP cavity and fitted to tubing (3.2 mm inner diameter, Tygon) by a Luer lock for subsequent infusions. A 22-gauge indwelling catheter was also inserted into the IP cavity and connected to two pressure transducers (4426-005G, Measurement Specialties Inc.) for measuring intra-abdominal pressure via a data acquisition system (myDAQ, LabVIEW, National Instruments). A veterinary monitor (SurgiVet Advisor, Smith's Medical) was used to monitor vitals. A pulse oximetry sensor (V3078, Smith's Medical) was clipped to the hind leg of the rat to measure the pulse rate and arterial oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SaO 2 ). A temperature probe (WWV3418, Smith's Medical) was placed rectally for monitoring body temperature. A bolus of perfusate was pumped through a fluid warmer (iWarm, Midmark) set at 40.4 C and into the IP space with a peristaltic pump (Thermo Scientific, FH100M) at 40 mL/min for 1 min, and then at 8 mL/min thereafter. At this time, the rats experienced a right pneumothorax by perforating the pleura of the pulmonary cavity with a scalpel. Infusion lasted until distension of the abdomen was noticeable, and the total infused volume of perfusate was recorded. The fluids used as a perfusate were saline as the control and oxygen microfoam (70 vol% O 2 gas volume fraction).",

Our design was chosen to mimic the naturally occurring surfactant that lines the lung alveolus [23] , which is primarily composed of diacyl phosphatidyl-choline (PC). Saturated PC lipids self-assemble at the gas/water interface to form a 3-nm thick monomolecular layer that can be compressed to achieve very low interfacial tensions [24] , which is necessary to avoid premature microbubble dissolution [25] . We chose distearoyl PC (DSPC) as the main lipid component because it provides an optimal tradeoff between in-plane rigidity to stabilize microbubbles for long durations in storage [26] and relatively low gas permeation resistance [27] . The lipid monolayer is permeable to oxygen and other gases, so the bubble is in continuous diffusive exchange with surrounding dissolved gases [28] . While highly permeable, the lipid shell modulates gas exchange by resisting monolayer expansion and compression beyond the closepacked lipid configuration at the microbubble resting radius [29] . We also chose a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) conjugated lipopolymer with a matching stearate lipid anchor as an emulsifying agent to improve yield by promoting lipid adsorption onto newly formed oxygen microbubbles and inhibiting microbubble coalescence. Self-consistent field theory calculations indicate that under these conditions the PEG chains form a w10-nm thick hydrated brush layer [30] , which can lead to very high repulsive pressures between closely approaching microbubbles [31] . The PC/PEG shell comprises only w1% of the total microbubble volume, but is essential for stabilizing the microbubbles against coalescence and dissolution.",

[14] . We attribute the limited uptake for pure oxygen ventilation to the problem with injecting a bolus of free gas into the peritoneal cavity. Surface area is minimized owing to the high surface free energy (w73 mJ/m 2 ) of the gas/water interface. Thus, one may compare the transport of a centimeter-scale bubble for pure oxygen ventilation to hundreds of billions of micrometer-scale bubbles for OMBs. The transport process from the bubble to the bulk fluid occurs via three steps (Fig. 4a) : (i) diffusion from the bulk gas to the inner surface of the lipid monolayer shell, (ii) diffusion through the lipid monolayer shell and absorption into the liquid phase and (iii) diffusion in the liquid from the bubble surface to the bulk. The mass transport resistance for diffusion from the gas to the surface (R gas ) is estimated from kinetic theory to be approximately 10 \u00c05 s/cm [37] and is independent of microbubble size assuming zero tension in the lipid shell [24] . The shell resistance to oxygen permeation (R shell ) has been measured to be approximately 10 2 s/cm [27] , which is larger than 1.2 s/cm predicted by a statistical thermodynamics calculation for absorption at a clean oxygen gas/liquid animals treated with OMBs survived to the 2-h endpoint and were subsequently euthanized as directed by the IACUC protocol. The median survival times for untreated animals and those treated with oxygenated saline were 15.5 (n \u00bc 6) and 18.5 min (n \u00bc 5), respectively. Thus, OMB infusion significantly increased survival time compared to saline control (P \u00bc 0.0039, unpaired two-tailed t-test using the 125 min endpoint for OMBs). (b) Animals treated with OMBs had an SaO 2 between 80% and 90%, as measured by a paw-cuff pulse oximeter. SaO 2 rapidly declined for animals treated with saline control. (c) The heart rate for animals treated with OMBs was 240e 350 bpm immediately following the right pneumothorax and increased to 300e 350 bpm throughout the experiment. Animals treated with saline control experienced a rapidly declining heart rate. The pulse oximeter could read up to a maximum heart rate of 350 bpm.",

A plot of the three transport resistances shows that diffusion in the liquid dominates the transport process for larger bubbles, but begins to approach that of the shell for microbubbles (Fig. 4b) . Thus, the oxygen flux from microbubbles to the peritoneum approaches the physical upper limit for gas absorption through a lipid monolayer. In addition to increasing the oxygen transfer coefficient (k L ), OMBs provide an increase in interfacial area per unit volume (a \u00bc 2.10 \u00c2 10 4 cm 2 mL \u00c01 for 70 vol% of 8-mm diameter OMBs) compared to a 1-cm diameter ventilation bubble (a \u00bc 4.20 cm 2 mL \u00c01 ). This gives an estimated volumetric transport coefficient (k L a) of 45 s \u00c01 for OMBs compared to 2.1 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 s \u00c01 for a ventilation bubble. The total oxygen transport rate is equal to the product of the volumetric transport coefficient and the concentration gradient between the gas phase and the peritoneum. Thus, OMBs provide a much higher overall oxygen delivery rate to the peritoneum, providing a plausible explanation as to why OMBs are successful in peritoneal oxygenation where pure oxygen ventilation has failed.",

More research must be done to investigate microbubble peritoneal oxygenation in larger animals where the ratio of the peritoneal area to total body mass is closer to humans. To mitigate this limitation, other serous membranes could be perfused to increase the surface area for O 2 transfer. For example, it may be possible to circulate OMBs through the intrapleural space. This limitation underscores the necessity of efficient O 2 transfer between the perfusate and the serous membrane, and as shown in this work, OMBs provide high O 2 carrying capacity and rapid diffusion capability.",

The oxygen core is stabilized by a thin (w3 nm) phospholipid monolayer membrane, which reduces surface tension and provides in-plane rigidity. A hydrated PEG brush (w10 nm height) grafted to the lipid surface provides steric repulsion to prevent microbubble coalescence. (b) A scaled-up OMB manufacturing process is used to generate up to 2 L of OMBs (w70 vol%) per day. (c) Bright field microscopy of diluted OMBs showed discrete, spherical microbubbles. (d) OMBs have a milky white appearance and can be stored and transported in 500-mL serum bottles. (e) Shown are the volume and numberweighted size distributions for freshly generated OMBs. The dashed lines are the number (blue) and volume (red) mean diameters. The shaded area covers the size range for 90% of the total OMB gas volume.
