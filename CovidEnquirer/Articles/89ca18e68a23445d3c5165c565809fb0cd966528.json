Particular attention was paid to the surface proteases AP N/CD13 and DP IV/CD26. In recent years, the interest in these and other proteases has increased remarkably because, among other things, peptidase inhibitors indicate roles of ectopeptidases in regulating biologically active peptides, such as cytokines and growth factors. Thus, a great number of studies have been published with respect to the participation of the constitutively expressed transmembrane protease DP IV in T cell activation and memory (9) (10) (11) . However, contradictory results have been published concerning the occurrence of the ubiquitous zinc-containing exopeptidase AP N in lymphocytes. Whereas AP N-like enzymatic activities are detectable using spectrophotometric methods (9, (12) (13) (14) ; the available monoclonal antibodies against CD13 recognize monocytes and granulocytes, but not lymphocytes of the PB (15, 16) . AP N catalyzes the removal from peptides of N-terminal, preferentially neutral, amino acid residues and is suggested to be involved in the metabolism of regulatory peptides, e.g., through small intestinal and renal tubular epithelial cells and through synaptic membranes (17) .",

Synovial tissues were obtained from 3 patients with JCA who were undergoing synovectomy. MNC were eluted as described by ABRAHAMSEN (18) . Human spleen tissues were kindly provided by the HLA laboratory of our Medical Faculty. MNC of the spleen tissues were separated using Ficoll-Hypaque.

In addition, the cells were cultivated with SF from a patient with RA. Figure 4 reaction. Furthermore, we observed a tight co-expression of all 3 surface molecules studied after stimulation with Con A/IL-2, though there were differences over the course of time and between individuals. On the other hand, incubation of MNC with SF from a patient with RA resulted in a clear increase of CD13 and of HLA-DR, but in a slight decrease of CD25. After addition of cycloheximide to SF, only approximately 10 % of CD3+ cells stained positively for CD13 (Fig. 5 ). This could be the result of the distribution of internal \u00abstorage places\u00bb, because staining for CD13 of fixed PB lymphocytes also revealed approximately 10 % CD13+ T cells (Table 2) . Possible conclusions are as follows: (1) CD13 expression on PB lymphocytes is inducible by mitogens -though not to the extent reached in SF; (2) CD25 and CD13 are regulated independently of each other; (3) the cell-free SF contains CD13-and HLA-DR-but not CD25-augmenting mediators and (4) expression of CD13 on more than approximately 10 % of CD3+ cells needs pathways that may be inhibited by cycloheximide. The effects of SF on PB lymphocytes have not been uniformly discussed in literature. CROUT (21) reported that the addition of autologous cell-free SF resulted in an increased incorporation of tritiated thymidine by PB lymphocytes. On the other hand, HAIN (22) demonstrated that SF by itself had no significant stimulatory effect on PB lymphocytes. Further experiments are necessary to obtain a clearer picture of the influence of cell-free SF on lymphocytes.",

Our observations confirm results of enzymatic evidence of AP N in lymphocytes (9, 12, 13) . It seems unlikely that T cells acquire the surface aminopeptidase as a consequence of the migration process through a tissue compartment, since lymphocytes prepared from spleen tissue show no detectable expression of CD13 by use of different monoclonal antibodies. In addition, also T cells of the peritoneal fluid of patients who had ethanolic liver cirrhosis displayed no detectable staining for CD13.

This raises the question as to whether an unmasking or alteration of certain CD13 epitopes by synovial enzymes is the reason for the binding of monoclonal antibodies to SF lymphocytes. This seems not to be the case, because an incubation of PB lymphocytes of patients with RA in autologous SF lasting 4 h at 3rc induces no subsequent labelling of lymphocytes with CD13 specific antibodies. Furthermore, in the presence of Con A/IL-2, a 3-day incubation of PB MNC from control persons not only induced an increase on T cells of the activation markers HLA-DR and CD25, but also of CD13 (Fig. 4) . This data strongly supports the hypothesis that CD13 is a new activationassociated antigen of lymphocytes.",

GRIFFIN (25) investigated myeloid precursor cells with the CD13 specific monoclonal antibody anti-MY7. He suggested that MY7-antigen, though not recognized by the antibody, could be expressed at low antigen-density throughout myeloid differentiation. Detectable MY7-expression identified an actively proliferating fraction of myeloid colony forming cells (25) . While investigating CD13 on monocytes and rheumatoid synovial tissue macrophages using the monoclonal antibody 3DS, KOCH (26) observed an augmentation of CD13 when monocytes were exposed to interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide. The CD13 antigen increased parallel with the MHC class II antigen expression and also when monocytes in culture were maturing to macrophages. The author suggested that as monocytes enter the synovial tissue from the blood, they rapidly migrate to the synovial lining layer, where they bear both MHC class II and some activation antigens, such as CD13 (26) . WERFEL (27) observed variable enhancement of CD13 expression on monocytes and granulocytes within minutes after these cells had been stimulated with C5a. Though these examples are not simply transferable to the situation in lymphocytes, they show the complexity of involvement of CD13 in the activation processes of blood cells. The rare occurrence of CD13 on lymphatic leukaemia cellsinterpreted as myeloic co-expression with a worse prognosis (2S) -is a further example of the scarcely understood integration of CD13 in prolifer-ation or differentiation processes. In addition, the observation that CD13 represents a receptor for coronaviruses could be of major pathological importance (29, 30) .",

            "text": "As a membrane protease that cleaves N -terminal amino acid residues from small polypeptides, AP N seems suitable for regulation of biologically active peptide hormones. This has been already shown for enkephalins and endorphins, degraded by AP N in synaptic membranes of the central nervous system (31) . In this case, the enzyme is accompanied by another zinc-dependent membrane protease, the endopeptidase 24.11 (CALLA/ CD10). We were unable to detect this differentiation antigen of lymphoid precursor cells on synovial lymphocytes \u00ab 3 %, data not shown). However, the majority of T cells expressed CD13 together with CD26, a membrane protease expressed on activated T cells irrespective of cell cycle (32) . This result makes it tempting to speculate about a functional cooperation of both the peptidases.",

However, experiments are in preparation to investigate a possible association between inflammatory activity and CD13 expression on T cells, not only from SF, but also from other inflammatory effusion fluid.",
