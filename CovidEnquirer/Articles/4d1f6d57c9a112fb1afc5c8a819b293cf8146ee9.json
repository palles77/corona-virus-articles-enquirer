The exosomes derived from dendritic cells (Dex), tumor cells (Tex), and malignant effusions demonstrate immunomodulatory functions, and are even under clinical trial for cancer treatments. In this study we report the phase I clinical trial of the ascitesderived exosomes (Aex) in combination with the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the immunotherapy of colorectal cancer (CRC). The Aex isolated by sucrose/D 2 O density gradient ultracentrifugation are 60-90-nm vesicles that contain the diverse immunomodulatory markers of exosomes and tumor-associated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Totally 40 patients (HLA-A0201 + CEA + ) with advanced CRC were enrolled in the study, and randomly assigned to treatments with Aex alone or Aex plus GM-CSF. Patients in both groups received a total of four subcutaneous immunizations at weekly intervals. We found that both therapies were safe and well tolerated, and that Aex plus GM-CSF but not Aex alone can induce beneficial tumor-specific antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Therefore, our study suggests that the immunotherapy of CRC with Aex in combination with GM-CSF is feasible and safe, and thus can serve as an alternative choice in the immunotherapy of advanced CRC.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] It has been shown that exosomes are highly enriched in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, MHC class I, heat shock proteins (HSPs), adhesion molecules, and other functional cellular components. 7, 8 Exosomes produced by numerous cell types can be defined by three major criteria: a size of 60-90 nm in diameter, a density of 1.13-1.21 g/dl in a sucrose gradient and an endocytic origin. [1] [2] [3] [4] It has been demonstrated previously that exosomes play functional roles in eradication of obsolete proteins, antigen presentation, or act as \"Trojan horses\" for viruses or prions. [1] [2] [3] [4] Recently, exosomes have been the focus of immunologists because exosomes derived from either DC (Dex) or tumor cells (Tex) can serve as a kind of cell-free vaccine and can induce potent antitumor immunity in animal models. 5, 6 Dex are able to present antigens to T cells (directly and indirectly) and stimulate antigen-specific T-cell responses. 5, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] When used as a tumor vaccine, Dex loaded with acid-eluted tumor peptides can eradicate established tumors in mice. 5 Most tumor cells constitutively release exosomes (Tex) in the extracellular milieu. In mice, it has been revealed that Tex can also serve as antigen delivery systems and can prevent autologous tumor development in a CD4 + and CD8 + T cell-dependent manner. 3, 6 However, the isolation of autologous Tex may require the in vitro culture of primary tumor cells derived from cancer patients, which may be inconvenient in clinical trials. The findings by Andre et al. suggest that exosomes can be isolated from malignant effusions of melanoma patients and can deliver melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (Mart-1) and tumor antigens to DC for cross presentation to specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). 16 Most recently, the exosomes derived from malignant effusions of cancer patients have also been prepared and are ready for clinical trial. [17] [18] [19] Thus, Aex may be used as cellfree tumor vaccine in the immunotherapy of cancer.",

We found that the isolated Aex were universal membrane vesicles with the diameter ~60-100 nm (Figure 1a) . Western blotting analysis demonstrated that Aex were enriched in MHC molecules (MHC-I and MHC-II), HSPs (including HSC70, HSP70, and HSP90), CD80, ICAM-1, CD71, and LAMP-3 (Figure 1b) . Notably, the typical CEA of CRC was also detected in the Aex. Because the capacity of exosomes in stimulating antitumor immune responses is largely dependent on the levels of MHC molecules and HSPs, 3, 4 we examined the expression of MHC-I and HSC70 as quality control standards for all the Aex preparations. Most of the prepared autologous Aex contained high levels of MHC-I and HSC70 (Figure 1c) . These results (morphology, density, and protein components) suggested that the Aex prepared by us were exosomes.",

Therefore, we went further to examine whether the immunotherapies with Aex or Aex plus GM-CSF induced systemic antigen-specific antitumor immunity both in vitro and in vivo. First we performed the antigen recall experiments by examining the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in CRC patients 2 weeks after the last immunization. We found that Aex immunization at a dose of 300 or 500 \u03bcg could efficiently induce DTH responses [100% in groups C (4/4), D (5/5), G (5/5), and H (4/4)] in the presence or absence of GM-CSF adjuvants ( Table 3) . However, when lower doses of Aex (200 \u03bcg per immunization) were used, GM-CSF could significantly increase the efficiency of Aex in the induction of DTH, as evidenced by the differences between the DTH response rate of group B (1/5, 20%) and that of group F (3/5, 60%) ( To further determine whether the antitumor immune response was specific for CRC, we examined the CTL response by tetramer staining, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) release assay, and cytotoxicity assay after isolating CD8 + T cells from the DTH response sites. The HLA-A*0201-restricted CEA peptide CAP-1 (YLSGANLNL) and the irrelevant HLA-A*0201-restricted coronavirus SARS-CoV spike protein peptide SSp-1 (RLNEVAKNL) were used in these assays. For the evaluation of the tetramer tests, we established a ratio of percentages (of CD8 + tetramer + cells specific to CAP-1 to that specific to SSp-1) of more than twofold as a positive one.

            "text": "CRC is one of the common gastrointestinal diseases encountered in clinical practice. Malignant ascites may be present when CRC cells metastase and are seeded in the peritoneal cavity. Patients with malignant ascites are always correlated with poor prognosis in clinical practice. 31 However, isolation of exosomes contained in effusions and the induction of antitumor immune responses by Aex may be beneficial in clinical therapy of CRC patients with ascites. Immunotherapy of CRC with malignant ascites has not been performed in clinical trials. In this study, we have assessed the feasibility, safety, and efficiency of Aex plus GM-CSF in the treatment of CRC. We have demonstrated that Aex plus GM-CSF treatment is more efficient than Aex alone in the induction of tumor-specific systemic antitumor immunity and CTL responses. The treatment protocol tested in this study causes grade I or II toxicity in CRC patients, suggesting that the successfully isolated Aex can be safely applied in clinical trials. Therefore, our phase I clinical trial data suggest that the Aex from CRC patients can be selected to induce antitumor immunity, and the presence of GM-CSF as adjuvant can significantly promote the efficiency of the vaccine Aex. We show in this study that Aex contain CEA, MHC molecules, and HSPs, which may be recognized by epidermic antigen-presenting cells and, in turn, stimulate the activation of T lymphocytes. Our in vivo DTH tests have confirmed that Aex alone are sufficient in the induction of systemic anti-Aex immunity, suggesting that the Aex alone are immunogenic. Our detection of CTL responses in the DTH sites-derived cultured cells indicates that Aex can activate CD8 + CTL and may elicit tumor antigen (e.g., CEA)-specific antitumor immunity. However, it is surprising that Aex alone, even at doses >200 \u03bcg, are rather inefficient in the induction of tumor-specific CTL responses, which may be due to the poor immunogenecity of Tex. Both Dex and Tex have been explored as cancer vaccines. 5, 6, 20, 21 The studies show that both Tex and Dex are efficient in the induction of tumor-specific immunity and the regression of tumor progression. 5,6 Although peptide.

IFN-\u03b3 level in the culture supernatant was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the results were presented as mean \u00b1 SD of triplicate samples. Data presented here were the results derived from patient G1 who was treated with 300 \u03bcg Aex plus 50 \u03bcg granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.",

[32] [33] [34] [35] [36] There is evidence suggesting that Tex may be a kind of tumor escape mechanism and can induce tolerance of the host to tumor antigens. [32] [33] [34] Interestingly, the immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL-10 and tumor growth factor-\u03b2, have been detected in the Tex. 32 Therefore, Tex may be of poor immunogenicity in clinical patients. However, exosomes derived from malignant effusions of melanoma patients are efficient in delivering melanoma antigens to autologous DC in vitro, suggesting that Aex may need the assistance of competent DC to present the antigens contained in Aex (either as an MHC-antigen peptide complex or as HSP-chaperoned antigens) to T cells in vivo. 16 The malignant effusions, ascites, used in our study may also contain DC, T cells, methothelial cells in except of CRC cells. Therefore, the Aex we have tested may be a mixture of exosomes derived from various origins. Because exosomes derived from different origins are similar in morphology, gradient density, and protein components, 1,2 it is hard to speculate which kind of exosomes are involved in the observed immune responses and clinical outcomes. However, based on the previous studies, 16, 18, 19 the detection of CEA in Aex and the cytology examination of peritoneal cast-off cells (data not shown), we suggest here that the major exosomes were derived from CRC cells seeded in the peritoneal cavity, and the exosomes derived from DC, T cells, and methothelial cells may also contribute to the induction of host immune response against CRC. Further examination of specific markers for these cells may help to answer this question.",

            "text": "Results of our previous work have shown that exosomes prepared from heat-stressed CEA-positive tumor cells can induce and enhance HLA-A*0201-restricted and CEA-specific CTL response in vivo and in vitro because these exosomes accumulate HSPs and MHC-I molecules. 24, 26 It has also been demonstrated by the others that an exosome-based cancer vaccine can enhance the host immune responses against tumors in combination with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides or double-stranded RNA. 22, 23 GM-CSF has potential properties as a vaccine adjuvant and has been widely used as adjuvant in clinical trials of cancer vaccines. 29, 30 GM-CSF is a factor that can mediate the maturation and function of DC, and can increase the expression of MHC molecules and costimulators. 37, 38 Studies have shown that tumor cells either transfected with GM-CSF genes or mixed with GM-CSF biodegradable capsules are able to induce specific immune responses in vitro and in vivo. 39, 40 In this study, we selected a 50 \u03bcg dose of GM-CSF as adjuvant because the GM-CSF may enhance the vaccine-induced immune response at low doses (range 40-80 \u03bcg) but suppress immune function at higher doses (100-500 \u03bcg). 41, 42 Therefore, it can be expected that GM-CSF co-administration with Aex may lead to the enhancement of the efficiency of the Aex vaccine by promoting antigen presentation and T-cell activation, which is verified by our findings that the co-administration of Aex with GM-CSF is superior to Aex alone in inducing HLA-A*0201-restricted and CEA-specific CTL responses. Therefore, the immunogenic potential and efficiency of Aex still remain to be investigated in clinical trials. Trials with Aex in combination with other adjuvants may improve the efficiency of Aex in CRC immunotherapy.",
