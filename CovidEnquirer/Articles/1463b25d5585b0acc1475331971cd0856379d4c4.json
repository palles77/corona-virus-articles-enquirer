Each leader with an average of 10 years of ICN experience directed PPE trainings for an estimated 50-5,495 HCP, mostly using fluorescent markers.

Due to the 1 size (ie, extra large) of level-D coveralls, petite female HCP had baggy fits that blunted their work processes. In contrast, for large male HCP with problems rolling down the coverall off their shoulders, 1 hospital changed its protocol to advise them to pull the coverall down by holding the sleeves with hands inside the sleeves on the back. Likewise, cup-shaped N95 respirators often developed cracks in the chin area for small-jawed female HCP. When HCP failed the fit-test or found fluorescent lotion contamination, it provoked anxiety. Evolving PPE protocols over the prolonged outbreak period caused confusion for HCP at later PPE trainings attributable to changes from practical experience or other hospital benchmarks. Inconsistent government protocols (eg, different holding locations for N95 respirators; that is, by side strings or the front) increased confusion. Participants also wanted valid evidence on effective hours for PPE items. The most common doffing difficulty was locating the coverall zipper-slider and pulling it down with gloved hands. Sometimes the overlapping parts of different PPE items were ill-fitted (eg, gaps between goggles and N95 respirator). With more PPE items, the doffing order became complicated and confusing. For example, the outer gloves were not the first doffing item when untying the outer shoe cover strings first.",

Sometimes ICN leaders had to allow HCP their own methods to assuage their anxiety, due to a lack of scientific evidence on various scenarios.",

Although many Korean HCP volunteered for MERS care, they may have faced the dilemma of working or quitting, as some Canadian nurses experienced during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. 7 Therefore, more suitable PPE products for female HCP and further research to generate robust evidence are necessary for developing gold-standard PPE protocols to ensure HCP and patient safety in future outbreaks.
