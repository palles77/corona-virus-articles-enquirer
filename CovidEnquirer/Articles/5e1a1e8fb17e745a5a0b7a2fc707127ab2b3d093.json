Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), plays a protective role in pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Here, we showed that ACE2 protein levels were significantly downregulated after infection with H1N1 viruses but was dispensable for viral replication. ACE2 protein downregulation was most likely related to ACE2 protein degradation by proteasome pathway rather than ACE2 shedding. Finally, we found that ACE2 cleavage could be regulated by influenza neuraminidase (NA), which was fundamentally different from the classically sheddase-induced proteolytic cleavage of ACE2.",

The reninangiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in pathogenesis of acute lung injury (Jerng et al., 2007; Kuba et al., 2006; Marshall et al., 2004) . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the RAS, protects against acute lung injury in several animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (He et al., 2007; Imai et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008b) . ACE2 was identified as a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and mediated efficient virus replication (Hamming et al., 2004; Li et al., 2004 Li et al., , 2003 Li et al., , 2005 . ACE2 expression was markedly downregulated in acute lung injury of mice caused by infection with SARS-CoV. The virus replication was effective in ACE2-transfected 293T cells, but could be blocked by anti-ACE2 antibodies on Vero E6 cells (Li et al., 2003) . However, little is known about the mechanism of ACE2 in pathogenesis of influenza-induced acute lung injury. If ACE2 expression levels were altered after influenza virus infection has not been confirmed yet.",

Hence, it is reasonable to suspect that ACE2 molecular weight decline might be related to NA enzyme activities. 293T-ACE2 cells were transfected with either pcDNA-N1 or pcDNA-EGFP to generate positive expression of N1 and EGFP (Fig. 6b) . The results showed that cells transfected with pcDNA-N1 resulted in ACE2 molecular weight decline compared with those transfected either with or without pcDNA-EGFP plasmid (Fig. 6c) . The downregulation of ACE2 protein levels could also be induced by pcDNA-N1 transfection into 293T-ACE2 cells compared with cells mock-infected with AF (Fig. 6d) , which suggested that ACE2 molecular weight decline might due to NA enzymatic activity.",

SARS-CoV downregulated its receptor ACE2 and induced TACE-dependent ACE2 shedding. ACE2 shedding most likely accounted for SARS-CoV induced ACE2 downregulation (Glowacka et al., 2010) . However, influenza virus-induced ACE2 decline was most likely related to ACE2 protein degradation by proteasome pathway rather than ACE2 shedding. Sheddases and some stimuli like virus infection regulate the release of ACE2 from the surface of cells (Jia et al., 2009) . ACE2 shedding was actually not increased from influenza virus-infected CNE-2Z cells. Knockdown were obtained at 12 hpi after infection with PR8 or CA07 at a moi of 5. Control cells were mock-infected with AF. Influenza NP (a) was also examined. (c) The cell lysates of CNE-2Z were obtained at indicated time points after infection with PR8 at moi of 5. (d) CNE-2Z cells were infected with PR8, CA07, H5N1 and H3N2. The cell lysates were obtained at 12 hpi and 24 hpi. Control cells were mock-infected with AF. ACE2 protein was detected by Western blotting. Densitometric analysis normalized to \u2424-actin levels was shown as fold change. All graphs represent the means \u00b1 S.E.M. *P < 0.05 were considered statistical significant. of TACE expression by shRNA did not affect ACE2 downregulation in this study. ACE2 as the receptor for SARS-CoV mediated efficient virus replication; ACE2 siRNA significantly decreased the SARS-CoV mRNA copy number (Haga et al., 2008) . However, ACE2 knockdown did not attenuate influenza A virus replication in this study.",

In this study, it was identified that overexpression of Influenza A (H1N1) virus NA protein could reduce ACE2 protein molecular weights in 293T-ACE2 cells, but it did not increased ACE2 shedding (data not shown). Coincubation recombinant ACE2 proteins with PR8 or CA07 virus could also decrease both total ACE2 protein levels and molecular weights in vitro. These findings indicated that influenza A (H1N1) virus-induced ACE2 molecular weight decline might be the result of cleavage by enzyme activities of N1, which was different from ACE2 shedding.
