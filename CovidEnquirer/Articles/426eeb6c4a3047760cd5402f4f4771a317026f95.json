The purpose of this study was to determine whether the V920 vaccine is capable of replicating in arthropod cell cultures of relevant vector species and of replicating in live mosquitoes. While the V920 vaccine replicated well in Vero cells, no replication was observed in Anopheles or Aedes mosquito, Culicoides biting midge, or Lutzomyia sand fly cells, nor in live Culex or Aedes mosquitoes following exposure through intrathoracic inoculation or feeding on a high-titer infectious blood meal. The insect taxa selected for use in this study represent actual and potential epidemic vectors of VSV. V920 vaccine inoculated into Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes demonstrated persistence of replication-competent virus following inoculation, consistent with the recognized biological stability of the vaccine, but no evidence for active virus replication in live mosquitoes was observed. Following administration of an infectious blood meal to Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes at a titer several log 10 PFU more concentrated than would be observed in vaccinated individuals, no infection or dissemination of V920 was observed in either mosquito species. In vitro and in vivo data gathered during this study support minimal risk of the vector-borne potential of the V920 vaccine.",

            "text": "ZEBOV particles are filamentous and enveloped. 4 The ZEBOV genome consists of a non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule which is approximately 19kb and encodes eight proteins: nucleoprotein (NP), virion protein (VP) 35, VP40, glycoprotein (GP), secreted glycoprotein (sGP), VP30, VP24, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L). 5, 6 Notably, GP mediates attachment and fusion of the virion to affected cells. 5, 7 Previous studies have shown immunization against GP to be an effective means of eliciting a protective immune response against a lethal ZEBOV challenge due to GP containing important neutralization or other functional epitopes. 8, 9 Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Order: Mononegavirales; Family: Rhabdoviridae; Genus: Vesiculovirus) is an enveloped virus containing a non-segmented, single-stranded, negativesense RNA genome. This approximately 11kb genome encodes five viral proteins: the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), glycoprotein (G), and the large protein (L). 10 The epidemiology and ecology of naturally-circulating vesiculoviruses remains poorly understood, but VS viruses and/or serological evidence of exposure to VSV have been found in a diversity of domestic and wild vertebrate species. [10] [11] [12] The two serotypes of VSV, VSV-Indiana and VSV-New Jersey are both transmitted to mammals by hematophagous insects as well as through direct contact via the transcutaneous or transmucosal route. 10, 12 Transmission competent insect vectors of VSV include biting midges (Culicoides spp.) phlebotomine sand flies (Lutzomyia and Phlebotomus spp.), black flies (Simulium spp.), and mosquitoes. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Clinical illness in cattle, horses, and pigs as a result of VSV infection includes vesiculation, ulceration, and erosion of the oral and nasal mucosa and epithelial surface of the tongue, coronary bands, and teats. 11, 12 The prevalence of clinical cases in cattle herds is generally low (10%-20%), but seroprevalence within the herd may approach 100%. 11 VSV has proven to be a successful vector in the development of several live-attenuated vaccine candidates due to its ability to accept and stably express foreign gene products from heterologous viruses. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] To develop a safe and efficacious single-dose vaccine against ZEBOV, the G gene of VSV was replaced with the immunogenic glycoprotein (GP) gene of ZEBOV, resulting in VSV virion particles expressing ZEBOV GP as the surface antigen. [27] [28] [29] [30] The resulting rVSVDG-ZEBOV-GP construct, also referred to as V920, is a replication competent, live-attenuated vaccine that has attenuated replication and a narrower host-cell tropism in vitro than wild-type VSV. 27 The resulting rVSVDG-ZEBOV-GP construct has been tested in several animal models, including mice and non-human primates (NHPs), and has been shown to be safe and to elicit a robust, protective immune response. 29, [31] [32] [33] [34] This vaccine has been tested in several clinical trials and has been shown to have an acceptable safety profile, to be immunogenic, and to be highly effective in preventing ebola virus disease (EVD) induced by ZEBOV in humans. [35] [36] [37] [38] A viremia is detectable, generally in the first few days after vaccination, but at low levels, as will be discussed below. 39 However, due to the vector-borne potential of wild-type VSV, certain environmental concerns must be addressed. Development of live attenuated vaccines using an arbovirus as a vaccine vector introduces the risk that an immunized person might develop a viremia high enough for a susceptible insect to become infected with and potentially transmit the vaccine. This phenomenon was documented with the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus vaccine TC-83, when TC-83 was isolated from mosquitoes in Louisiana following its use in horses to stop the 1969-72 epidemic in Texas. 40 In the case of V920, while the backbone is an arbovirus, prior experimental evidence demonstrated that Ebola Reston virus was incapable of replication in arthropods. 41 Therefore, we hypothesized that the V920 rVSVDG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine would not replicate in arthropod cells or live mosquitoes. Furthermore, in addition to our inclusion of a wild-type VSV-Indiana strain (VSV-I) control throughout the study, we included another VSV construct with the G gene of VSV replaced with the structural cassette, sans capsid, of Semliki Forest virus (SFV), termed rVSV-SFV, as a control. The rationale for including rVSV-SFV, which we hypothesized would replicate in arthropods due to the natural transmission of SFV by mosquitoes, was to demonstrate that the inability of V920 to replicate in arthropod (in vitro and in vivo) was due to the replacement of the arbovirus envelope cassette with the ZEBOV GP gene. An experiment was conducted to determine whether V920 replicated in arthropod cells. We evaluated the replication kinetics of all three viruses in several relevant insect vector cell lines derived from mosquitoes (Genera: Aedes and Anopheles), biting midges (Genus: Culicoides), and sand flies (Genus: Lutzomyia). We also assessed the replication potential of V920 in live Aedes and Culex mosquitoes exposed via an infectious blood meal and intrathoracic (IT) inoculation. Through this study, we confirmed the inability of V920 to replicate in arthropods in vitro and in vivo, interestingly we also found that rVSV-SFV was also unable to replicate in arthropods in vitro and in vivo.",

Following inoculations of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, V920 was recovered from one of three mosquitoes on eight days post inoculation. Furthermore, V920 was recovered from one of three Ae. aegypti mosquitoes on each days 8, 10, and 12 post inoculation. Additionally, rVSV-SFV was recovered from one of three mosquitoes on 8, 10, 12, and 14 dpi in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes; rVSV-SFV was not recovered from Cx. quinquefasciatus on any days post inoculation. Because the V920 and rVSV-SFV detections found in these few individual mosquitoes (33%) at these late timepoints and did not exceed the dose inoculated, these results are believed to represent detections of vaccine persisting in the mosquito following inoculation rather than the result of actively replicating virus. By comparison, VSV-I was found in 100% of inoculated mosquitoes after day 2 post inoculation and replicated to mean titers of approximately 3 log 10 PFU, approximately 2-3 log 10 higher than the inoculum dose by 1-2 days post-inoculation. The virus titers detected in mosquitoes were significantly different as measured by a Kruskal-Wallis test with a Dunn's multiple comparisons post-test. For Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, VSV-I was significantly different (p-value <0.05) from both V920 and rVSV-SFV, with p-values of 0.0036 and <0.0001, respectively.

Since the titer of the virus detected in these mosquitoes did not exceed the titer of the original inoculum, we hypothesized that the virus detected was due to the persistence of stable, replication-competent virus from the original inoculum rather than the result of active replication in mosquito tissues. This experiment revealed that the titer of all viruses declined over time, but replication-competent virus particles were present in mosquito homogenate out to 7 days in Cx. quinquefasciatus and 14 days in Ae. aegypti ( Figure 2) . A two-way ANOVA was conducted with a Tukey's multiple comparisons test to compare the mean titer of each virus group. In comparing virus stability between VSV-I and V920, virus titers were significantly different in both Aedes and Culex mosquito suspensions. A similar pattern was observed in comparing virus stability between VSV-I and rVSV-SFV. These results are consistent with the results of the IT inoculations, and further support our hypothesis that, while low levels of thermostable virus may persist, it is highly unlikely that V920 replicates in mosquitoes following IT inoculation.",

Wild-type VSV-I is recognized for its potential to be transmitted by diverse taxa of arthropod vectors including mosquitoes, sand flies, and biting midges. 13, 14, 17, 19, 42 Further, active replication of VSV-I in IT-inoculated Ae. aegypti mosquitoes has been previously demonstrated. 43, 44 Hence, the cell lines and mosquito genera used in this study were selected based on previous field isolations of VSV 13, 14 or demonstrated laboratory competence 17, 19, [42] [43] [44] of these insect groups for replication or transmission of VSV. As expected, VSV-I replicated in all cell lines examined as well as both genera of mosquitoes, demonstrating the relevance of the arthropod groups included in this study and the importance of evaluating the replication potential of the V920 vaccine in diverse insect taxa. As expected, substitution of the glycoprotein of a non-vector-borne virus (ZEBOV) ablated the ability of VSV to infect and replicate in various arthropod cell lines as well as in live mosquitoes. All three viruses were replication-competent in Vero cells. However, only VSV-I grew in C6/36 (Ae. albopictus), 4a3b (An. gambiae), CuVa (C. sonorensis), and LL-5 (L. longipalpis) cells or live Culex or Aedes mosquitoes. Overall, these results support the work of Turell et al. (1996) who found no replication of Ebola Reston virus when this virus was inoculated into mosquitoes or ticks. 41 While we expected that V920 would not replicate in arthropod cells, the inability of rVSV-SFV to replicate in arthropod cells was unexpected. The purpose of including rVSV-SFV was to show that if the glycoprotein of VSV were replaced with that of another arbovirus (in this case SFV) the resulting recombinant VSV would be capable of replicating in arthropod cells. While the results confirm our main hypothesis, that V920 is incapable of replicating in arthropod cells, the results obtained with rVSV-SFV demonstrate the need for more research into the mechanism for determination of host range in VSV chimeric viruses. Indeed, this system could lead to many insights regarding the infection of arthropod cells. The rVSV-SFV construct has the VSV G gene replaced with the full structural cassette of SFV, sans capsid. Given the ability rVSV-SFV to replicate in cells derived from a vertebrate host and not of those derived from arthropods, this construct could be used to determine key mediators of host range infection and of alphaviruses and arboviruses in general. The specific step of viral replication that is preventing the formation of progeny virions in arthropod cells exposed to rVSV-SFV is currently unknown. However, the most likely block is occurring at the point of attachment and entry for the virus. The mechanism associated with virus attachment and entry in arthropods has long remained cryptic for alphaviruses and other arboviruses. 45 This tool could lead to important insights regarding the mechanisms intrinsic to both virus and arthropod that allow an infection to progress.",

            "text": "Our experiments revealed that the replication kinetics of VSV-I in C6/36 cells was atypical compared to that in the other arthropod cell lines ( Figure 1C ). Given a differential susceptibility of mosquito cell types to infection with VSV, the cells comprising the C6/36 cell line, derived from larval Ae. albopictus, are perhaps not as permissive to infection with VSV as compared with the cell types available to these viruses infecting live mosquitoes. Bergold et al. (1968) studied the tissue tropism of VSV-I and VSV-New Jersey strains in Ae. aegypti following intrathoracic inoculation and demonstrated that while VSV infected a diversity of mosquito tissues over the course of infection, virus concentrations per microgram of tissue were highest Mosquitoes that were positive for DI were also had a positive IS Mosquitoes that were positive for DI were also had a positive IS in the thoracic and abdominal ganglia at 8 days post inoculation, and the salivary glands at 20 days post inoculation. 44 The C6/36 clone, derived from the original SAAR Ae. albopictus cell line, was selected for its increased permissiveness to replication of dengue and chikungunya viruses. 46 However, this selection may have favored replication of some viruses but not others. The specific reason why the C6/36 cell line did not support replication of VSV-I to the same extent as the other arthropod cell lines, despite replication of this virus in a closely-related live mosquito vector species, deserves further study. The V920 vaccine inoculated into Cx quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes demonstrated the presence of replication-competent virus in a small proportion of intrathoracicallyinoculated mosquitoes at low titer following inoculation ( Table 1 ). The results from follow-up experiments investigating virus stability in a homogenized mosquito matrix are consistent with the data from the IT-inoculations, and support the hypothesis that the low-level persistence of V920 in a few mosquitoes is due to the biological stability of the virus rather than active replication ( Figure 2 ). Persistent, replication-competent virus particles for both VSV-I and V920 were present in the homogenized mosquito matrix for 7 days in Cx. quinquefasciatus homogenate, and for 14 days in Ae. aegypti homogenate ( Figure 2) . Additionally, rVSV-SFV was detected intermittently out to 12 days in Ae. aegypti. These results are consistent with the results of the intrathoracic inoculations, whereby persistent V920 was detected in inoculated Cx. quinquefasciatus 8 days post-inoculation, and in Ae. aegypti 12 days post inoculation (Table 1) . Why virus persistence in Ae. aegypti was longer than in Cx. quinquefasciatus for both the biological stability test and the intrathoracic inoculations is unclear. While mosquito homogenate is a very different environment for a virus as compared to live mosquito tissues, these data provide evidence that replication-competent virus particles of the V920 vaccine are able to persist in a disrupted environment for one to two weeks ( Figure 2) . Therefore, the V920 vaccine detected in mosquitoes following IT inoculations most likely represented residual inoculum and was not the result of active replication in mosquito tissues. This conclusion is also supported by the failure of V920 to replicate in vitro in mosquito cells. Development of a positive strand-specific RT-PCR would be one approach to specifically test for the presence of actively-replicating virus in these samples from IT-inoculated mosquitoes. 47 Importantly, we demonstrated that V920 failed to infect mosquitoes following oral exposure through an infected to a blood meal containing a high concentration of virus. This experiment evaluated the only way that mosquitoes could become infected with V920 under natural conditionsby blood-feeding on vaccinated humans. Wild-type VSV-I was shown to infect both Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, although a midgut infection barrier was present in both species (Tables 2 & 3) . These results are consistent with a study that found moderate levels of virus dissemination in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes fed on viremic mice infected with VSV-I. 48 Infectious blood meal titers during these experiments were maximized to ensure that the probability of mosquitoes becoming infected was as high as possible. In the case of V920, mosquitoes exposed to >8 log 10 PFU/mL of virus did not become infected. Importantly, humans vaccinated with V920 develop only transient viremias peaking at approximately 3 log 10 PFU/ mL. 35 The probability of mosquitoes becoming infected after feeding on an infectious blood meal significantly declines below titers of 5 log 10 PFU/mL due to the small size of the mosquito blood meal and the likelihood of imbibing a virus particle at low circulating concentrations. 49 Therefore, our data and the quantitative viremia data from clinical studies indicate an extremely low probability of mosquitoes becoming infected from feeding on a vaccinated individual. Considering that the V920 vaccine lacks the surface glycoprotein of an arbovirus, did not replicate in mosquito, biting midge, or sand fly cells, and did not infect relevant mosquito vector species, our results support an extremely low risk of arthropod-borne transmission of this vaccine.",
