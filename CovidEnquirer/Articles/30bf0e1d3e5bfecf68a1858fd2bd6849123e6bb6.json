            "text": "The original discovery of RNAi relevant phenomenon can be retrospect to 1990. Napoli and Jorgensen claimed a transgene-induced \"cosuppression\" of endogenous chalcone synthase gene during generation of hybridized violet petunias. 1 Later in 1992, a similar phenomenon was observed by Romano and Macino in Neurospora crassa. 2 They described a \"quelling\" of the endogenous gene caused by the introduction of homologous RNA sequences. However, RNAi event in animal was first reported in Caenorhabditis elegans by Guo and Kemphues until 1995, noting introducing sense or antisense RNA can lead to the degradation of par-1 mRNA. At the time, homologous antisense RNA was regarded as the tool of silencing to hybridize with endogenous mRNAs then form doublestranded RNA to stop translation. Guo and Kemphues used only sense par-1 RNA has no hybridization capacity with the endogenous par-1 transcript in their validation. Interestingly, the degradation of par-1 mRNA was still observed. The results raised questions and uncertainty of potential regulation mechanism remaining undiscovered. 3 Followed the investigation of these paradoxical findings, Fire and Mello published a paper stating possible explanations of \"cosuppression, quelling and sense mRNA\" against endogenous genes in 1998. 4 In their C. elegans models, they had employed both purified single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) and double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) targeted mRNA of unc-22 gene. The dsRNAs consistently demonstrated higher efficacy than either ssRNAs in gene silencing results of individual and whole population. They proposed dsRNA could be the trigger of stoichiometric implicating integrated against endogenous mRNA in vivo, and possible catalytic or amplification components played a highlighting role during the interference process. These regional developing into systemic silencing effects required a stable intermediate system. Then, Hamilton and Baulcombe first demonstrated the existence of stable intermediate system in plants to support this hypothesis. They suggested dsRNAs need to unwind and the antisense RNA strand served as a guide to bind to the mRNA. Though full length antisense strand were never found, an estimated 25 nt antisense RNA is required for the specific binding based on their observation. 5 Besides, another two different teams found 21-23 nt RNAs could always be purified from Drosophila cells with RNAi, proposing a shorten convert of dsRNA mediated cleavage of targeted transcript. 6 Researchers further used 21-22 nt chemical synthesized dsRNA to determine this system in various species, finding short dsRNA mediated gene silencing also exist in mammalian cells. 7 Ambros's group found both lin-4 and let-7 genes can encode short temporal mature RNAs in the length of 22 nt in C. elegans. These short RNAs were further identified as miRNA. 8 Following investigation showed that genome sequences are tended to form hairpin loops, and these stem-loop sequences as precursor RNAs are the source of miRNAs. miRNA was demonstrated to have gene regulation effects at post-transcriptional level in various species. 9 It has been determined that the substance that directly leads to gene silencing is small dsRNA. So, how is small dsRNA formed? Bernstein's team discovered RISC responsible to mRNA cleavage could be collected by high-speed centrifugation, whereas short converted dsRNA fragments still remained in the supernatant, which indicated the initiation phase of dsRNA cleavage into siRNA and the effect phase of mRNA cleavage destruction are the result of two different enzymatic activities. 10 Hannon's group hypothesized the initiate phase enzyme should be a dsRNA ribonuclease and then chose different RNase III family enzymes for investigation. 8 By using T7 epitope tag labeling and immunoprecipitation to quantify 21-23 nt siRNAs yields of different RNase III enzymes, they found only the enzyme encoded by gene CG4792 had the regulation activities and named it \"Dicer\". Sontheimer's group then confirmed depletion of Dicer would cause a loss of siRNAs production and fail to induce further silencing on different target genes. 11 On the other hand, initial identification of RISC was carried out by Tuschl's team in human cervical cancer Hela cells. 9 They used biotin to conjugate with 3 0 terminal of siRNAs in order to coimmunoprecipitate out whole associated protein complexes. Argonaute 1 and Argonaute 2 (Ago1 and Ago2) were isolated after purification. In 2004, Joshua-Tor's group purified an Argonaute protein from the archebacterium Pyrococcus furiosus (PfAgo). 10 PfAgo has a PIWI domain sharing high similarity with RNase H enzymes and have two identical DDE (aspartate-aspartate-glutamate) motif catalytic carboxylates which are also required for the cleavage activities in RNase H. Based on these results, Joshua-Tor then collaborating with Hannon's group used immunoprecipitation to investigate Ago1-4 complexes activities in 293T cells. 12 The results showed though siRNAs bound to all Ago proteins, but only Ago2 complex had cleavage activity. Hannon tried to mutate key amino acids of the PIWI domain in Ago2. The mutated Ago2 can only bind to siRNAs but has no cleavage capacity. Besides cleavage activities, how did siRNAs bind to RISC had raised a great research interest as well. Evidence showed only single-stranded siRNAs were found within RISC, which indicated a potential unwind and bind mechanism. Both Gregory's team and Matranga's team found Ago2 has the RNA helicase function to unwind duplex siRNAs, employ one guide strand to find complementary mRNA, remaining anti-guide strand will be cleaved and removed. 13, 14 This mechanism is essential for the RISC activation. Although Ago2 hold function of cleaving both siRNA and target mRNA, only Ago2 protein could not recruit any siRNA. For RNAi event, researchers found RISC composed of Dicer, Ago2, and TRBP (the HIV-1 TAR RNA binding protein) is required. TRBP helps recruiting the Dicer complex to Ago2 which form a ternary complex induce RNAi activities.",

Researchers observed and recognized that RdRP can employ aberrant accumulated RNAs as templates to generate secondary siRNAs against same mRNA and then cause sequences specific degradation, and this process was named \"transitivity\". 15 RdRPs play an important role in various forms of RNAi amplification. In Arabidopsis, unprimed RdRPs employed both 5 0 and 3 0 mRNA cleaved fragments as substrates to produce long dsRNAs. These dsRNAs were then cut by Dicer to generate secondary siRNAs and induced mRNA degradation. But in C. elegans, a different mechanism was described. Unprimed RdRPs can directly use primary siRNAs as template substrates. Through transitivity process, Dicer-independent secondary siRNAs were directly synthesized and presented same properties of sequences specific degradation on same mRNA. 16 Upon constantly enriched knowledge of RISC formation and functional activities, the understanding of entire RNAi conceptual system had been greatly improved.

Dicer was first identified as a multi-domain RNase enzyme in Drosophila. It has two existence forms: Dicer-1/Loquacious (R3D1-L) which produces miRNA and Dicer-2/R2D2 which produces siRNA. Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 share structural homology features but display different properties like ATP dependency and substrate specifications. 19 Dicer-1 is an ATP independent enzyme working as precursor related to miRNA biogenesis. 20 Previous research found that Dicer-1 needs to work together with a double-stranded RNA binding protein (dsRBDP). In Drosophila, dsRBDP Loquacious (Loqs) was identified to have interaction with Dicer-1. 20 Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have purified a functional pre-miRNA processing complex containing both Loqs and Dicer-1. This complex directly activated and participated in pre-miRNA processing activity. Structural analysis showed only Loqs-PA and Loqs-PB among Loqs protein species have three dsRNA binding domains (dsRBD) and Loqs-PB can increase the affinity of Dicer-1 toward pre-miRNA. 20 Dicer-2 is an ATP-dependent enzyme that showed substrate specificity to dsRNA. 19 Sharing structurally homology with Dicer-1, Dicer-2 also needs to work together with a dsRBDP-R2D2. Dicer-2 associated with R2D2 can form a functional heterodimeric complex. 19, 20 Unlike Loqs, R2D2 has only two dsRNA-binding domains which can interact with long dsRNA but does not regulate siRNA generation activities. R2D2 plays an important role in development and stability of Dicer-2. It has demonstrated that both dsRNA binding domains of R2D2 and Dicer-2 are essential to the process of Dcr-2/R2D2 complex binding with siRNAs then loading them into RISC. 21 Structural analysis showed Dicer-2 has an RNA helicase domain, a DUF283 domain, an N terminus' PAZ domain, tandem RNase III motifs and a C terminus' dsRBD motif. Since Dicer-2 or R2D2 alone does not bind with siRNAs, which indicated siRNA might bind with the interface between R2D2 and Dicer-2 then triggered a conformational change on complex allows them to coordinately bind siRNA to promote assembly of the siRISC complexes. 21 In the effector phase, single strands siRNA or miRNA work as guide strands are incorporated into RNAi effector such as the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) which cleaves mRNA and represses translation, or the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex which regulates heterochromatin assembly (Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "The sequence design of effective and specific siRNA is the key to successful gene silencing by RNAi. To date, various siRNA design algorithms and programs have been developed and widely used by biologists for siRNA design. These algorithms have certain rules called Tuschl's rules that are based on some parameters, including length, 3 0 overhang, absence of intron regions, GC contents, absence of repeats, absence of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites, homology to other genes or sequences, RNA secondary structure, etc. 7,25-27 Two years later, Khvorova et al. suggested that the thermodynamic properties of siRNA are also critical parts in determining the function and longevity by involving in siRNA duplex unwinding and strand selection. 28 After years of development, now there are various web-based programs that design siRNA candidates. The faculties of the University of Hong Kong combined 11 free online siRNA design tools together and developed their own filtering algorithm to filter ineffective siRNAs (http://i.cs.hku.hk/sirna/software/sirna.php). 29 It has been shown that many siRNA design programs tend to select different siRNA candidates with a range of siRNA efficacies even though we run the same algorithms with the same target Table 1 Compare different types of siRNAs sequences. 30 So, it is recommended to use two or more siRNA design programs and compare the multiple sets of candidates to search for the optimal siRNA sequences. Once the siRNA that against the specific gene has been obtained, it has to be effectively delivered into cells. There are three efficient and inexpensive delivery methods of siRNA: transfection, electroporation and viral vector. The first two are non-viral delivery, the rest one is, as the name implies, viral delivery. Transfection generally has three modes: cationic liposomes, polymer nanoparticles, and lipid conjugation. It is relatively easy to transfect siRNAs into most of cell lines with high efficiency and reproducibility, and there are many commercial reagents offered. However, it is not suitable for all kinds of cells such as primary cells and non-dividing cells and has low efficiency in vivo. 31 For hard-transfected primary cells, stem cells and neuronal cells, electroporation, another intracellular delivery method, could be a good choice. The cell membrane is consisted of phospholipid bilayer which is susceptible to electric shock. When there is a powerful voltage pulse, the lipid molecules will reorient to form hydrophilic pores to let nucleic acids in via electrical current. But different cell types need different optimal parameters, and this method is easier to make cell die. Viral-mediated delivery, similar as transduction, deliver siRNA through some recombinant viral vectors based on retrovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAVs), adenovirus and lentivirus. It can be used for primary and non-dividing cells, compatible for in vivo experiments and stable expression. But problems arise because it can lead to possible mutagenic and immunogenic effects and need to generate and titrate viral particles. 32 Dr. Mark Helm and his groupmates used the fluorescent-labelled siRNA to trace the fate and their subcellular location of synthetic siRNA. From the results of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based visualization, once siRNA gets into cell, it translocates into the nucleus and reach high concentrations at an early time point, then relocates to the cytoplasm in next 4 h. Up to 48 h, nearly 99% siRNA have been degraded. That is in accordance with RNAi activity, which reaches the peak at about 24 h and decreases within 48 h. 33 In this process, siRNA assembles with RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) with no need to continue processing with Tat-RNA-binding protein (TRBP)/PKR activating protein (PACT)/Dicer complex, which is needed for shRNAs or long dsRNAs. 34 ",

            "text": "The use of synthetic siRNA to strongly downregulate specific gene expression is a promising method. However, this reduction is basically transient, since the concentration of siRNA gradually reduce to so low level by cell division that leads to inefficient suppression of gene expression, especially in long-lived cells. For this reason, a vector-based method has been developed for gene silencing by the expression of a shRNA which mediates persistent suppression of gene expression. 35 shRNA is an artificial molecule, too. Typically, it consists of two complementary 19-22 nt RNA sequences linked by a 4-11 nt short loop and 2 nt overhangs at 3 0 ends that similar as pre-miRNA so-called stem-loop structure. 36 And it also can be designed by web-based programs. The shRNA is usually delivered as a gene construct that consists of a promotor, shRNA and a transcription termination sequence. 37 Expression of shRNA in cells can be achieved by delivery of plasmids, viral vectors or bacterial vectors. Transfection can be used to introduce plasmids into cells which is similar as the transfection of siRNA. It can be accomplished by using commercial transfection reagents in vitro but cannot be used in vivo. Viral-mediated delivery also can be used for shRNA through some recombinant viral vectors based on adeno-associated virus, adenovirus and lentivirus. The gene construct is simple and small so that they can be easily inserted into vectors. The genomes of AAVs and adenoviruses are episomal so that they cannot be integrated into the genome of the host cells. In addition, AAVs have diminished packing capacity to limit the induction of immune responses in host cells. But with cell dividing, the virus will be lost quickly. Different from AAVs and adenoviruses, lentiviruses can integrate its own genome into sections of transcriptionally active chromatin and be passed on to progenies so that increase the risk of insertional mutagenesis. The other kind of vectors that can be used for delivery of shRNA is bacterial vector. Dr. Shuanglin Xiang and his co-workers engineered the Escherichia coli to produce plasmids of shRNA to knock down gene expression in vitro and in vivo. 38 Different with siRNA, shRNA is synthesized in the nucleus of cell. Once the vector into the cells, the gene will integrate into the host genome and is then transcribed by Pol III or Pol II depending on the type of promoters. That's why shRNA can induce sustainable RNAi. Then, shRNA further transports to the cytoplasm and assimilates into the miRNA pathway. 34 The common used one is Pol III based on U6, H1 or tRNA promotors. 35, 39, 40 These promoters direct high levels of shRNA expression and afterward mediate highly efficient gene knockdown. However, the high concentration of shRNA also has side effects: increase the off-target possibility and lead to non-specific effects such as interferon response and cellular toxicity. 41 And they lack cell specificity. Compared with Pol III, Pol II may be used to direct cell-or tissue-specific gene silencing. 37 shRNA is 10-fold more efficient than siRNA. For most of siRNAs, the effective concentrations for knocking down target genes are usually on nanomolar level, while less than five copies of shRNA are sufficient for being integrated in host genome. 34 Even though, many researchers still study on the improvement of efficacy. Replaced polymerase III by highly efficient polymerase II, 37 overexpressing exportin 5, 42 and expressing multiple shRNA in a single plasmid vector. 43 shRNA also has some limitations. Due to the advantage of stable expression, it can be used to generate stable knockdown cell lines. But this project is a time-consuming task since the design of gene construct and the selection of shRNA-positive cells. 36 ",

            "text": "It can be seen from the mechanisms of RNAi that long dsRNA is an effective inducer of RNAi. So, it is also a good idea to synthesize long dsRNAs in vitro. For instance, in Drosophila, dsRNAs of more than 150 bp or even longer were shown to trigger gene silencing effectively. 25 But they are not fit for mammals. This is because long dsRNAs activate the expression of genes in the interferon pathway, including the gene encoding dsRNA-activated protein kinase PKR, which inhibits translation by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2 a-subunit (eIf2a) on Ser51 and induces transcription of inflammatory genes 44 and 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) which can cause nonspecific effect by activation of RNase L, 45 resulting in termination of these two protein syntheses and finally causing cell death. Since the activities of siRNAs that target to different sequences have profound differences and the expensive cost for synthesizing siRNAs, although, they can suppress selective gene expression without triggering interferon responses, an alternative method that using bacteriophage promoters to mediate transcription from linearized DNA templates to obtain long dsRNA has been developed. The most popular one is using T7 RNA polymerase. 46 With the deepening of research, many biochemical research results show that RNAi is completed by a multicomponent nuclease. And the function of this complex is guided by a small guide strand (21-22 nt siRNA). As a result of biochemical fractionation and genetic approaches, a nuclease called Dicer from RNase III family has been identified. It can cleave dsRNA into siRNAs in vitro. The Dicer kit has already been commercialized (Genlantis). This method is cheaper and can obtain a large number of siRNAs. 10, 48 In 2005, Dr. Dong-Ho Kim with his co-workers found that some dsRNAs have greater potency than synthetic 21 nt siRNAs directed to the same target site, and that this property seemed to correlate with length. With the increasing of the length of the siRNA, synthetic RNA duplexes 25-30 nt in length is 100-fold more potent. Especially, the duplex length of 27 nt has the maximal inhibitory and it doesn't induced interferon or activate protein kinase R (PKR). That means that synthetic RNAs that are substrates for Dicer are more potent than conventional RNAs. It is possibly because that increasing the length of an siRNA duplex with an unprocessed end is thermodynamically more stable and prompting the incorporation with Dicer/TRBP/PACT complex for more efficient RISC assembly. 49 ",

Initially, RNAis were performed by microinjecting corresponding dsRNAs into worms to observe the phenotypic changes of the parents and progeny. 4 In the same year, Lisa Timmons and Andrew Fire found that C. elegans show gene-specific manners depending on the dsRNAs in the exposure environment. C. elegans normally feed on bacteria, sucking in the pharynx and subsequently digesting in gut. Thus, the bacteria that expressing dsRNAs can result in specific gene silencing on nematodes that feed on bacteria. 52 Hirlaki Tabara, Craig C. Mello and their groupmate also showed that feeding and soaking worms in dsRNA are effective ways in gene silencing. 53 And these methods hold promise for high-throughput RNAi. [54] [55] [56] This method begins with the creation of feeding strain. First select a target region of approximately 500 bp that corresponding to the mRNA and link into plasmids that having specific structure. Then, the plasmid should be transformed into an E. coli RNase III mutant strain to express dsRNAs. One point that needs special mention here is that the effect of gene silencing on liquid culture medium or plates feeding nematodes is similar, depending on penetration and expression efficiency. However, the experimental processes and the restrictions are still different. 57 ",

They are associated with differentiation, homeostasis and disease. miRNAs have already been found in plants, animals and some viruses and they are conserved in both plants and animals. miRNA can regulate mRNA expression while miRNA also can be regulated by other regulators. One kind of the regulators is miRNA inhibitor which can be used to study the functions and mechanisms of endogenous miRNAs. miRNA inhibitors are mainly divided into two categories, natural miRNA inhibitors and artificial miRNA inhibitors. Natural miRNA inhibitors are competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) (such as viral RNAs, mRNAs, pseudogene RNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs), which competitively recognize miRNA recognition elements (MREs) to reduce the inhibitory effect of miRNA and release target mRNA. 58-60 ceRNA model describes potential communication networks among all transcripts and provides an opportunity to discover the novel therapeutic targets for human cancer.",

Inhibition of miRNAs can alleviate their over-repression of target mRNAs and restore normal cell phenotype, so it is considered as a promising therapeutic strategy. Different from natural ones, artificial miRNA inhibitors are exogenous RNAs, including anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs) and miRNA sponges. AMOs are single-stranded short RNA oligonucleotides that are fully complementary to the miRNA. Due to their single-stranded structure, they are easily degraded by nucleases. Chemical modification can be a good way to increase affinity for target miRNA, stabilize miRNA inhibitor to avoid nuclease degradation, prevent cleavage by RISC and promote tissue uptake for in vivo delivery. 61 Barbara Robertson and her colleagues showed that the function of the inhibitors varies with the position of the mismatch in the inhibitors. The \"seed region\" (3rd-8th nucleotides) and the \"3 0 region\" (13th-18th nucleotides) are equally important in determining recognition of the inhibitor target by endogenous miRNAs. 62 With the deep research on AMOs, they are widely used in miRNA loss-of-function study and miRNA suppression therapy. However, there are still many shortcomings that inhibit the development of this discovery. The inhibition still could not be sustainable and permanent; AMOs are toxic and can trigger innate immune response and finally cause cell death; the concentration of AMOs that used in transfection cannot exert satisfactory inhibition, whereas the higher concentration may cause cell death. 63 The miRNA sponge is a designed RNA transcript that expressed from strong promotor and bind to target miRNA competitively via multiple and tandem miRNA binding sites. 64 Different from AMOs, once miRNA sponges can be transfected and expressed stably in cells, they can play a prolonged even permanent role in suppressing individual miRNA or the whole family. 63 miRNA sponges are also widely used in miRNA loss-of-function study and miRNA suppression therapy.",

When p19 was expressed in E. coli, a small RNA species accumulates that is double-stranded and 21 nt in length, like eukaryotic siRNAs. We named those bacterial siRNA-like RNAs pro-siRNAs for \"prokaryotic siRNA\". Escherichia coli RNase III, which belongs to the same RNase III endoribonuclease family as eukaryotic Dicer, is responsible for the generating pro-siRNAs. RNase III is also known to generate 21 nt dsRNAs in vitro. 69 This method relies on ectopic expression of p19, a siRNA-binding protein found in a plant RNA virus. When expressed in E. coli, p19 stabilizes 21 nt siRNA-like species produced by bacterial RNase III. Transfection of mammalian cells with siRNAs, generated in bacteria expressing p19 and a hairpin RNA encoding 200 or more nucleotides of a target gene, at low nanomolar concentrations reproducibly knocks down gene expression by 90% without immunogenicity or off-target effects. Because bacterially produced siRNAs contain multiple sequences against a target gene, they are especially useful for suppressing polymorphic cellular or viral genes. 70 ",

RNAi screen provide new approaches for the understanding of unknown biological pathways. On one aspect, it can be performed as high-throughput genome-wide screen to help to identify all possible regulators in a general process. On the other hand, it can also serve as limited screen to help to narrow down crucial factors in a specific pathway. 71 In RNAi screen, sequence specific RNAi reagents were introduced into model organisms to cause degradation of targeted transcripts. RNAi process employed the 21-25 nt double-stranded siRNA fragments with a characterized 2-nt 3 0 overhang, which are produced from the cleavage of long dsRNA by type III endoRNase Dicer. Different cell types, approaches and delivery methods of cell-based RNAi screening has determined the setup of appropriate RNAi reagent libraries. In models that lack the defensive of type I interferon response, such as C. elegans and Drosophila, long dsRNA can be taken up for the intracellular cleavage activities of Dicer to produce a highly specific overlapping siRNA pool against target genes. 72 But in mammalian cells, introduction of exogenous long dsRNA can activate antiviral type I interferon response and dsRNA-binding protein kinase R, which leads to the disruption of phenotypic screening. In order to minimize interferon response, reagent pools prepared with recombinant bacterial RNase III or Dicer, in the form of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), endoribonuclease-prepared siRNAs (esiRNAs) or small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are used for mammalian cell screens. These RNAi reagents can escape interferon response and defense system at low concentrations. 73 Chemical synthesized siRNA is designed to mimic the final products of Dicer cleavage. Chemical modification offered superior duplex stability and high target mRNA knockdown efficiency for synthetic siRNA. Current commercial siRNA libraries are available to cover complete genome for several species. Most libraries provide three or more siRNA sequences against each target gene can reach estimated 95% silencing efficiency after transfection. 71 The extended protein depletion associated phenotypic changes are varied due to different protein lifetimes.",

Arrayed screening assays use multi-well plate to contain single RNAi reagent separately for the knockdown experiment. Readouts for arrayed screening can be the measurement of specific luciferase or fluorescence indicators. Moreover, high-content image-based readout can report quantitative parameters on morphology change, proliferation, viability, apoptosis and other cellular functions of individual targets or whole populations, by employing specific fluorescence imaging and labeling of samples in a high-throughput measurable format. Other than arrayed screening assays, pooled screen is to introduce a whole set of RNAi libraries into bulk populations of cells. The readout of pooled screen is required to present a selectable change in cell phenotype. It allows rapid analyses on multiple cell types. 71 Off-target effect of RNAi-based screen has stated as the major issue responsible to false discovery of candidates. Different types of off-target effects were distinguished from various studies. 75 For example, if a siRNA shares an identical sequence with an unrelated mRNA, the undesired silencing would produce a confused phenotype then result in false positive event. In addition, if the seed region of a siRNA duplex has a weakly complementary sequence in the 3 0 untranslated region of an unrelated mRNA, this siRNA can act like microRNA (miRNA) to induce undesired mRNA degradation or translational block, then cause non-target proteins depletion. In mammalian cells, introduction of short siRNA fragments can sometime sequence-independently activate the antiviral type I interferon response, then cause unpredicted false disturbance. To minimize off-target effects, non-target or scrambled RNAi sequences should be setup for the control. Different delivery method of siRNA should be monitored and evaluated. Multiple siRNA species should be used against each target gene. 75 Many complex phenotypes displayed on in vivo level cannot be analyzed through cell-based in vitro assay. With the availability of genome or transcriptome sequences information, in vivo RNAi makes it possible for researchers to perform functional genomics studies directly in model organism. RNAi phenomenon was first identified in C. elegans. Studies found that RNAi in C. elegans is systematic and heritable. Thus, various in vivo RNAi screens were conducted in C. elegans and provided numerous new understandings for diverse biological process such as aging and obesity. 76 Drosophila is another popular in vivo RNAi screen model. With a wellannotated genome and multi-specific genetic modify tools, tissue and stage specific studies were performed on Drosophila. With the ability of tissue or stage specific RNAi, Drosophila allows screens not only on embryo or larval, but on adults as well. 6 With the idea of pooled RNAi screen for the comparison of different cell populations, ex vivo screens by introducing pooled shRNA transfected cells in mice were performed. For example, by injecting transduced lymphoma cells into in vivo context, their ability and contribution for tumorigenesis can be directly assessed. 77 In vivo RNAi screen provides a straightforward and quick approach to screen an interest phenotype in a tissue and stage specific manner.",

Usually, the doses of small RNAs needed for local administration is lower than that for systemic administration. Since local administration only applies small RNAs into or near the target tissues, while systemic one circulates small RNAs around the whole body.

However, the bottleneck of clinical application of RNAi still exist that is the lack of effective siRNA delivery method in vivo, though effective approaches are available for delivering siRNAs into cell lines. In the early days of RNAi development, it has been shown that siRNAs can be systemically administrated into experimental animals by hydrodynamic intravascular injection, cholesterol conjugation, liposome, cell-penetrating peptide and various types of nanoparticles. However, some of the approaches are not practical or not safe for applications in human. And the efficiencies of those early approaches were typically low. Thus, a large number of siRNAs (typically tens of milligrams per kg) are required, which could make siRNA medicines prohibitively expensive. Large doses of siRNAs are more likely to cause undesired side-effects including immune activations. Enabling efficient delivery of siRNAs into specific tissues and across the cell membrane is a hotly pursued area of research. siRNA delivery technologies are also rapidly evolving.

Larvae fed with plant diet modified to express specific dsRNA against CYP6AE14, showed a retarded growth. 133 Followed the lead of these promising findings, further studies on how to control dsRNA transmission between host plant and insects, how to make feeding silencing effects inheritable etc. are emerging.",

            "text": "Parasitic weed is a major cause of poor crop production in agriculture. RNAi signals transmit through host crop to parasites was examined as a potential method to control parasitic weeds. Yoder's group transformed an interfering hairpin RNA-targeted GUS gene into lettuce. Then they used hemi-parasitic plant Triphysaria versicolor which expressed GUS reporter gene to parasitize the root of either transgenic or non-transgenic lettuce. After GUS staining, Triphysaria roots attached to transgenic lettuce showed respectfully lower GUS activity and transcript quantification confirmed a significant reduction in GUS mRNA level. 134 This result suggested sequence specific silencing signal can be successfully transmitted through host plant to parasitic plant and induce further suppression of target genes within parasites. Following this idea, Radi and his colleagues investigated RNAi transitions between tomato and parasitic Orobanche. 135 Orobanche spp. (broomrape) are parasitic plants subsisted through the attachment to the root of host plant. They can cause severe damage to various crops, including tomato. During the growth of Orobanche, strong mannitol accumulation was observed and mannose 6-phosphate reductase (M6PR) is the essential enzyme related to mannitol synthesize activities. Radi's team produced a transgenic tomato line stable bearing M6PR-siRNAs against Orobanche aegyptiaca's M6PR-mRNA. The RT-PCR quantification showed the level of endogenous M6PR mRNA in Orobanche aegyptiaca grown on transgenic tomato was significantly reduced by 60%-80%.",

During the past decade, researchers have demonstrated that fatty acids metabolism plays important roles in pathogenicity and related immune response. Takatsuji's group used RNAi method to silence OsSSI2, an essential gene responsible for desaturase activity of fatty acid. 136 The genetically modified Arabidopsis and soybean they produced showed resistance to multiple pathogens infection. Yet a following study focused on the fatty acid gene family members, OsFAD7 and OsFAD8 was conducted. With the suppression of OsFAD7 and OsFAD8 genes, an enhanced resistance against Magnaporthe grisea was observed in the GM rice line. 137 Other than metabolism related investigations, Fritz's team found that in Arabidopsis, flagellin can trigger specific miRNA expression and downregulate the Toll and immune deficiency pathways, which resulted in a significantly enhance of innate immune defense then further develop into resistance to the infection of different bacterial and fungal. 138 In tobaccos, studies have demonstrated RNAi mediated silencing of glutathione S-transferase can enhance immune response and develop the resistance to black shank disease. 139 ",

The idea is to create \"siRNA sprays\", similar to chemical sprays, which can be directly applied on the surface of plants. The siRNA spray approach has huge advantages over the GM approach because it is very easy to choose different siRNA sequences to target various crop genes or pathogens, eliminating the lengthy process of breeding GM crops. 140 In addition, siRNAs work temporally and do not alter the crop genomes, which help to alleviate public sentiments toward GM crops for causing permanent environmental impacts. 141 ",
