However, insufficient ventilation in these makeshift hospitals may increase infection risk of opportunistic airborne transmission. This was seen in the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] , similar to the current novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). According to the regulations in Hubei Province, the exhaust air volume in ventilation systems for makeshift hospitals is approximately 150 m 3 per hour per person now [2] , much lower than the guideline of 288 m 3 per hour per person advised by World Health Organization (WHO) for infection control in health care for natural or mechanical ventilation system [1] .",

With more ventilation, current low outdoor temperature will increase the need for heating inside the hospitals. Air conditionings and electric blankets are necessary to keep the patients warm. There remain challenges in energy consumption to exhaust such high-volume air for hundreds of people, and risks in potential unventilated zones in the large space buildings. An alternative to increasing dilution of contaminated air is to use air purifiers to reduce the possible virus-laden aerosols. And all the filters should be collected and disposed as medical waste or disinfected thoroughly to prevent secondary contamination. [5] . Values in yellow represent numbers of beds provided by makeshift hospitals on the first day of patient admission, values in red represent numbers of patients, and values in blue represent numbers of health-care workers.",
