Whether CHOP is involved in NDV-induced intrinsic 346 apoptosis? It has been known that CHOP promotes mitochondria mediated apoptosis 347 via down-regulation of the pro-survival BCL-2 family (24, 51). Thus, it will be 348 interesting to check whether the expression level of BCL-2 family is regulated by 349 NDV infection. Western blotting analysis showed that pro-survival BCL-2 and 350 MCL-1 were gradually decreased by 0 to 0.5-fold from 16 to 24 h.p.i in NDV-infected 351 HeLa cells ( Fig. 2A) .

HeLa cells were transfected with siIRE1\u03b1 or sic before being infected 536 with NDV, and the phosphorylation level of JNK was examined by Western blotting. (Fig. 6D) . Accordingly, in SP600125 558 treated cells, NP mRNA was also greatly decreased, compared to that in 559 DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 6E) . Meanwhile, inhibition of JNK kinase activity reduced 560 the cleavage of PARP by 0.7-fold (Fig. 6D) . Moreover, the transcription of death 561 ligand TNF-\u03b1 and cytokines IFN-\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 was markedly suppressed in SP600125 562 treated cells, as evidenced by semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR (Fig. 6E) . To 563 validate above results, specifically knock down of JNK by siRNA was performed. As 564 shown in Fig. 6F , JNK was successfully depleted by siJNK (0.05-fold), which 565 significantly reduced the level of viral NP expression (0.3-fold), compared to that in 566 sic control cells. PARP cleavage was also greatly decreased by 0.3-fold (Fig. 6F ).",

ERK1/2 is activated 393 by growth and neurotrophic factors (54-56); JNK and p38 MAPK are activated by 394 inflammatory cytokines and by a wide variety of cellular stresses (57, 58).
