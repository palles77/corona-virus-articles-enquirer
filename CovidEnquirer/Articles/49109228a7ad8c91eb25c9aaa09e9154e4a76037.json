Two of the 12 chronic hepatitis B patients had liver cirrhosis. Among the patients without cirrhosis, 3 were admitted for chronic hepatitis B flare-up and contracted SARS nosocomially; on admission, 5 patients had elevated alanine aminotransferase levels and 2 patients had normal levels. One patient died of respiratory failure related to SARS and another died of multiorgan failure. Among the survivors, the alanine aminotransferase levels in 6 patients had returned to normal and in 3 other patients had decreased on follow-up. Among the 106 HBsAg-negative patients, 16 (15%) patients had elevated alanine aminotransferase levels on admission. None of these patients had comorbid illnesses or had taken any medications. Seventy-one percent of patients who had normal baseline levels experienced elevation of alanine aminotransferase during the course of their illness. Clinical outcomes including oxygen requirement, need for intubation, and case fatality rate were not different in patients with normal and elevated baseline alanine aminotransferase levels. No patient developed liver failure. Overall, 66 of 80 (83%) patients who experienced alanine aminotransferase elevation had normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels on discharge and another 10 (13%) patients had decreasing levels on followup.",

Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain showed normal results. Her blood pressure was 176/63 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed cold lower limbs, weak pulsation over bilateral dorsalis pedis arteries, generalized muscle tenderness, shallow left nasolabial fold, left hemiplegia, paraplegia, absent bilateral extensor plantar reflexes, and hyporeflexia over the lower limbs. There were an estimated 150 stings over her head, face, and limbs. Platelet count was 104 \u03eb 10 3 / L, prothrombin time was 0.89 international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time was 24 seconds (control, 31 seconds).
