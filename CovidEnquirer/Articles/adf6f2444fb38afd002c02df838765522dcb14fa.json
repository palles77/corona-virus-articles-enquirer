The clever title derives from the fact that Dr. Leap works mostly nights, and his first column for Emergency Medicine News was ''The White Knights of Medicine.'' This piece spoke to the collective good we provide as emergency physicians.",

''Barbarians Are Alive and Well'' chronicles Leap's experience caring for a young man injured and felled by a barbarous attacker simply because he offered the barbarian's girlfriend his seat on a crowded bus. Probably many of us have shared his anguish as we've tended to society's victims. ''Breath Shepherd'' is a touching personal account of the author's nocturnal wanderings within the bedrooms of his own home watching over the respirations of his wife and 4 children. ''Breath is life,'' he writes near the end of the essay, and, a paragraph later, ''So there I am, a guardian of breath.'' For me, this represents truly a great connection between the work we all do and the personal flocks we tend.",

Some of the sentences, and the essays that contain them, rise to the level of greatness. Three of my favorites follow: ''This year I have tried on several sicknesses,'' ''I hope to be obsolete someday,'' and ''Sometimes a little brutal honesty is just what the doctor ordered.'' These sang to me because I've either had the experience (sickness), mused over the thought (obsolescence would be nice), or longed to speak my mind (honestly).",

You won't always agree with him, but Dr. Leap will challenge you to think about the life you lead as an emergency physician. I'd strongly recommend adding ''Working Knights'' to your required reading list. It might become the book you turn to after a series of busy shifts in an effort to regain your balance or fine tune your perspective. The Textbook of Pediatric Emergency Medicine has been a core resource of pediatric emergency medicine fellowships and within emergency medicine residencies since its first edition in 1983. In this edition, we see a significant evolution and advancement from the previous version. 1 Added to the fifth edition is a section on severe acute respiratory syndrome and, in the procedures section, the use of ultrasonography in the emergency department. Other sections have been modernized to reflect the changes in pediatric emergency medicine.",

The algorithm list is another excellent method to reference one's clinical dilemma. Either section could support the clinician in finding the answers when he or she is unsure of the exact question.

The procedure section is well illustrated but is not as detailed as a textbook dedicated to procedures such as the Roberts and Hedges 2 Clinical Procedures in Emergency Medicine. The ''Emergency Drug Compendium'' is likewise useful, but most clinicians would probably use a more specific drug reference or a PDAsupported application. The ultrasonographic section consists primarily of illustrations, with little instruction in the use and diagnosis capability of ultrasonography. There are now ultrasonography-dedicated textbooks that are more informative. Finally, the parental handouts are not printed for copying or perforated for removal, so their use would be only as a reference.",
