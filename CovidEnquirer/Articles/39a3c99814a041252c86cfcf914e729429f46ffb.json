Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity. In this study, antiviral activity examination of different resistant strains showed that the digestive juice of the resistant strain (A35) had higher inhibition to virus than the susceptible strain (P50). Subsequently, the label-free quantitative proteomics was used to study the midgut digestive juice response to BmNPV infection in P50 and A35 strains. A total of 98 proteins were identified, of which 80 were differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with 54 enzymes and 26 nonenzymatic proteins by comparing the proteomes of infected and non-infected P50 and A35 silkworms. These DEPs are mainly involved in metabolism, proteolysis, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, starch and sucrose metabolism and glutathione metabolism. After removing the genetic background and individual immune stress response proteins, 9 DEPs were identified potentially involved in resistance to BmNPV. Further studies showed that a serine protease, an alkaline phosphatase and serine protease inhibitor 2 isoform X1 were differentially expressed in A35 compared to P50 or post BmNPV infection. Taken together, these results provide insights into the potential mechanisms for silkworm digestive juice to provide resistance to BmNPV infection.",

BmNPV entered the midgut lumen and exposed to digestive juices after oral infection. Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity, however, current information on the digestive juice proteome of high resistant silkworm strain after BmNPV challenge compared to susceptible strain is incomprehensive. Here, we combined label-free quantification method, bioinformatics, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis and found that BmNPV infection causes some protein changes in the silkworm midgut digestive juice. The DEPs were identified in the digestive juices of different resistant strains following BmNPV infection, and screened out some proteins potentially related to resistance to BmNPV. Three important differentially expression proteins were validated by independent approaches. These findings uncover the potential role of silkworm digestive juice in providing resistance to BmNPV and supplemented the profile of the proteome of the digestive juices in B. mori.",

Wang et al. [12] performed a comparative subcellular proteomics analysis of the silkworm larval midgut response to BmNPV infection by 2-DE combined with MS. The iTRAQ method was also used to explore the molecular mechanisms of B. mori response to B. mori cypovirus (BmCPV) [13] and BmNPV [14] challenge. Additionally, the role of Hsp90 in BmN cells response to BmNPV infection was explored by TMT method [15] . The label-free quantitative technique is gaining fast traction in the proteomics field due to its rapid, straightforward, and low-cost required for measuring protein expression levels in complex biological samples [16, 17] .",

B. mori C-lysozyme (BmC-LZM) and BmAtlastin-n could enhance the resistance to BmNPV by overexpression in larvae and cells [18, 19] . Furthermore, a GP64binding protein E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SINA-like 10 (SINAL10) [20] and chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide 1 (TCP-1) [21] could stimulate BmNPV proliferation in BmN cells. Some studies regarding the role of the B. mori larval midgut in response to BmNPV infection have been conducted in previous studies utilizing RNA-Seq [22] , 2-DE combined MS [12] , label free [16] and iTRAQ methods [14] . Hu et al. [6] investigated changes in the protein composition of the silkworm digestive juice between non-infected and infected samples by shotgun and MS techniques. Their research, however, only involved the P50 susceptible strain. Although there is little information available on the digestive juice proteome of different resistant strains after BmNPV challenge. Our present study, notably, firstly made sure the virus inhibition difference of different resistant strain and following BmNPV infection. Consequently, we identified DEPs between A35 and P50 using the label-free proteomic technique. Further, possible functions of identified DEPs and their potential involvement in resistance to BmNPV infection are discussed. Our study provides insights into the functions of silkworm digestive juice in antiviral activity.",

However, comparing strains of different resistance revealed that band patterns between the two were significantly different (Fig. 2 ). For example, 55 and 30 kDa bands specially were visible when investigating patterning for the P50 strain, whereas 45 and 37 kDa bands were only visible when using proteins derived from the A35 strain.

In total, 98 unique proteins were identified, including 68 enzymes and 30 nonenzymatic proteins. Included in that total number are 72, 82, 82 and 87 proteins identified from P50-, P50+, A35-and A35+ strains, respectively. These results demonstrate that proteins derived from digestive juice mainly consist of enzymes, and are consistent with previous reports in B. mori and Helicoverpa armigera [5, 6] . Compared to studies by Hu et al. [6] which investigated protein expression in the digestive juice of silkworms, > 45 and 15 proteins were identified by Label-free quantitative approaches in P50-and P50+, respectively. Notably, eight specially expressed proteins were identified in our four experiment groups. Compared with other proteomics technologies, the Label-free method provides higher sequence coverage and ultimately detects a higher number of DEPs [34, 35] . Eighty proteins were identified found to differentially expressed when comparing between resistant and non-resistant strains +/\u2212 challenge by BmNPV. Among the proteins identified were 54 enzymes which mainly included serine proteases, lipases and aminopeptidases. There were also 26 nonenzymatic proteins which mainly included serine protease inhibitors and uncharacterized proteins. The DEP data was validated through the quantification of transcript abundance, however, three DEPs tested (AP, Trypsin-like serine protease and Spn-2) were only partially consistant with the label free data following BmNPV infection. Digestive juice proteins were synthesized by midgut cells and secreted into the midgut lumen. However, mRNA from the midgut can be regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels before proteins accumulate in digestive juice. Examples of the regulatory mechanisms possibly affecting protein levels include translational levels, such as mRNA stability, splicing, miRNA regulation and protein stability [13, 14] . Generally, only 60% -70% of the genes have transcript and protein abundance levels that are comparable as detected by qRT-PCR and proteomic methodology [36] .",

It is the most important type of digestive enzyme in the lepidopteran gut and accounts for about 95% of digestive activity [39] . In the present study, a total of 29 SPs were identified that were differentially expressed within the digestive juice of different resistant silkworm strains. The expression level of most SPs were up-regulated in the highly resistant A35 strain compared with susceptible P50 strain and further up-regulated in highly resistant A35 strain following NPV infection. Additionally, four SPs were identified that were potentially related to resistance to BmNPV in digestive juice by removing those DEPs related to either genetic background (A35-vs P50-) and individual immune stress response proteins (P50+ vs P50-). Nakazawa and Ponnuvel [9, 10] previously reported that alkaline trypsin and SP-2 purified from the digestive juice of B. mori larvae had strong antiviral activity against BmNPV under in vitro conditions. Bm-SP142 could effectively impair the ability of the virus to infect BmN cells and silkworms, and overexpression of Bm-SP142 could inhibit viral propagation in BmN cells [40] . Additionally, Chen et al. [41] found that the some anti-BmNPV genes expressed significantly higher in the resistant strains compared to susceptible strains. These results suggested that SPs, an insect digestive enzyme, can be a potential antiviral factor against BmNPV at the initial site of viral infection. It was implied that the high expression level of SPs in digestive juice is one potential reason the resistant silkworm strain is not susceptible to NPV infection.",

Ponnuvel et al. [8] purified a lipase from the digestive juice of B. mori larvae and confirmed that it had strong antiviral activity against BmNPV under in vitro conditions. In this study, two lipases (lipase member H-A and pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase) were differentially expressed. After BmNPV infection, the expression level of Lipase member H-A increased 3 times in the A35 strain, while no significant differences occurred in the P50 strain. These results suggest that the silkworm strain having higher expression level of lipase may also have stronger resistance to viral infection. Jiang et al. [44] found that in transgenic line silkworm over-expressing an endogenous antiviral gene lipase-1, mortality decreased to approximately 33% compared with the non-transgenic line. As the results suggest, we suspect that not only one lipase protein had antiviral functions in silkworm larvae digestive juice, and other proteins in the lipase family had similar functions.",

APN was the first molecule identified as a Cry toxin-binding protein from Manduca sexta [46, 47] , and it is an extensively studied putative receptor from other lepidopteran insect pests [47, 48] . In the present study, three APNs (aminopeptidase N, membrane alanyl aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase N-7) were identified from four experiment groups. Interestingly, the three APNs were down-regulated in A35 compared to P50 strains and also downregulated following BmNPV. APN acts as the viral receptor of some group I coronaviruses, such as human coronavirus 229E and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), in order to allow the virus to enter to cell [49, 50] . A study by Lucas et al. [51] indicated that membrane alanyl aminopeptidase N acts as a receptor for a plant virus in the pea aphid vector in vitro. Additionally, an APN interaction between BmDNV VD1 and ORF4 was identified by Co-immunoprecipitation [52] . We hypothesized that the APNs probably act as the receptor for BmNPV, or alternatively accelerate infection by interaction with BmNPV.

Interestingly, the two enzymes were specially expressed in the susceptible BmNPV P50 strain (Table 1 ). In Helicoverpa armigera, the expression level of chitin deacetylase-like proteins were down-regulated following infection with H. armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus, which might reduce the susceptibility for baculovirus infection by decreasing its PM permeability [53] . This result suggested that the different resistance of silkworm strains might be related to expression level of chitinolytic enzymes by affecting the PM permeability after the virus infection. On the other hand, there were two differentially expressed phosphatase proteins, including prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). The expression level of PAP was downregulated in A35 strain compared with P50 strain. Although the alkaline and acid phosphatase were reported to be involved in the transport of glucose and fatty acids on the intestinal wall membrane in B. mori [54] , Wang et al. [22] found that the expression levels of PAP were decreased following BmNPV infection in resistant strains, and suggested that PAP could directly or indirectly participate in repressing BmNPV replication in host cells. Lee et al. [55] also reported that the lysosomal acid phosphatase 2 (ACP2) was required for membrane fusion during influenza A virus (IAV) entry in mammal cells. Meanwhile, the expression level of AP in the P50 strain was higher than in the A35 strain (by Label free and Western blotting) (Fig. 7) . These results were consistent with a previous report that showed the expression level of AP in midgut was up-regulated in P50 compared with BC9 (resistant BmNPV stain) [14] . Additionally, AP activity was decreased in the silkworm embryonic cells after BmNPV infection [56] . In summary, PAP and AP might play an important role in response to virus infection.",

Thus, the immune response plays an important role in the defense against pathogens [57] . Here, four DEPs, including Spn-1, Spn-2, Spn-16 and PRP, are known to be related to the immune response were identified. Melanization is a major immune responses against large pathogens or parasites in arthropods, and phenoloxidase (PO) is a key enzyme in the melanization process [58] . In the insect immune response, Spn can bind to the active center of a serine protease during the Table 3 The DEPs potentially related to resistance to BmNPV. extracellular serine protease cascade, which makes the serine protease unable to activate the next level serine protease or PPO, thereby inhibiting the cascade reaction, and finally inhibiting melanization [59] [60] [61] . In this study, the Spn-1 and Spn-2 proteins were found that it significantly down-regulated in A35+ vs A35-and A35-vs P50-. Interestingly, the Spn-16 specially expressed in P50 strain. Pan et al. [62] found that the expression of Spn-2 in the midgut were significantly increased in susceptible strain after infected with BmNPV, while there was no significant change in resistant strain. These results indicated that Spn-2 may be involved in the B. mori antiviral response. Additionally, serpin-5 and serpin-9 can promote baculovirus infection by inhibiting melanizationin in Helicoverpa armigera [63] . Based on these findings, we speculated that the down-regulation of expression of Spn in resistant strains or following BmNPV infection might lead to inhibition of serine proteases and enhance host melanization to suppress infection by BmNPV in resistant strains. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns are pathogen molecules recognized by cells of the innate immune system (by pattern recognition receptors [PRRs]) [64] . Peptidoglycan recognition protein precursors (PRPs) were down-regulated in A35+ compared to A35-, but expression levels showed no difference in the P50 strain after BmNPV infection. Yu et al. [14] found that the pattern-recognition receptor-related proteins showed a different response to BmNPV infection in resistant strain vs non-resistant strains. As above all, the DEPs related to the immune response might play an important role in response to BmNPV infection in digestive juice.",

            "text": "In this study, a chlorophyllide A binding protein isoform X1 (CHBP) protein and red fluorescence protein were found in digestive juice. Interestingly, the expression level of CHBP was up-regulated but no significantly in control compared to BmNPV-challenged samples. However, it was significantly down-regulated in A35-compared to P50strains. The red fluorescent protein (RFP) had antiviral properties and the red fluorescence was suggested to be derived from the binding between insect midgut proteins and chlorophyllid \u03b1, the prosthetic group of chlorophyll. Moreover, it was also suggested that anti-BmNPV activity was attributed to chlorophyllid \u03b1 rather than the protein [65, 66] . Therefore, we speculated that the CHPB had an antiviral function in digestive juice, but is not the main contributing factor to silkworm resistance in the resistant strains. The peritrophic membrane (PM) as a first line of defense and is not absolutely responsible for the prevention of invasion of pathogenic microorganisms in insects, but the structural integrity of the PM may delay the invasion rate and delay the infection process [67, 68] . Insect intestinal mucin (IIM) is an important part of the PM and plays an important role in protecting insects from microbial infection. Wang et al. [69] identified the first invertebrate intestinal mucin from Trichoplusia ni larva and showed that it can resist the degradation of protease in the midgut. Here, two IIMs (mucin-2, insect intestinal mucin precursors) were identified from digestive juice. The expression level of mucin-2 and insect intestinal mucin precursor were down-regulated in A35+ vs P50+ and A35-vs P50-, respectively. Wang et al. [70] reported that the IIM can be degraded by enhancin, a synergistic protein produced by Trichoplusia ni granulovirus (TnGV), which specifically interacts with IIM, leading to the destruction of the integrity of the PM and thereby increasing the chances of the virus entering epithelial cells and killing insects. Consequently, we speculated that the BmNPV had an enhancin homologue with a similar function as IIM that might play an important role in BmNPV infection. There are also some other non-enzymatic DEPs have been showed response to virus infection, we will further study these proteins and elucidate their roles in BmNPV infection in the future.",

Here, we examined the antiviral activity of silkworm digestive juice and observed that the digestive juice of the resistant strain (A35) had stronger antiviral activity than the susceptible strain (P50). Additionally, the DEPs were identified that were likely responsible for the silkworm response to BmNPV in different resistant vs susceptible strains based on label free quantitative proteomics. In summary, 80 proteins were found to be differentially expressed, including 54 enzymes and 26 nonenzymatic proteins. DEPs identified here are mainly involved in proteolysis and associated with neuroactive ligand receptor interaction. After removing the genetic background and individual immune stress response proteins, we identified nine DEPs likely to be involved in response to BmNPV infection. These findings provide an overview of the protein content of the digestive juice of resistant and susceptible silkworm strains and their responses to BmNPV infection, They also expound on current knowledge of the mechanism of silkworm resistance to BmNPV.",
