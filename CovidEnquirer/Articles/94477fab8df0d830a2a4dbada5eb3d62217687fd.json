This led to the establishment of a formal committee of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, who reported on their deliberations in 1992, in a report edited by Joshua Lederberg and Richard Shope. This was followed 10 years later by a second report, edited by Mark Smolinski, Margaret Hamburg, and Joshua Lederberg, which appeared in 2003 . Among the factors they cited as contributing to emergence were microbial adaptation and change, human susceptibility to infection, climate and weather, changing ecosystems, economic development and land use, human demographics and behavior, technology and industry, international travel and commerce, breakdown of public health measures, poverty and social inequality, war and famine, lack of political will, and finally intent to harm.",

Although it is still important to isolate viruses in cell culture for their complete characterization, it is now possible directly to detect viruses in diseased tissues by PCR, then, by sequencing the amplicon, to determine whether a new virus has emerged to cause the disease. In fact, many viruses which do not readily grow in cell culture can only be differentiated by sequence analysis. The papillomaviruses are an example. Their study was very difficult until the advent of sequence analysis, which now has revealed more than 100 types in humans, and many more in animals and birds. For differentiation, three virus genes (E6, E7, and L1) are sequenced, and if the combined sequence of these three genes differs by more than 10% from known papillomaviruses, the virus is considered to be a new type. Other viruses which have not been grown in cell culture include many caliciviruses, and the ubiquitous anelloviruses, such as torque-teno (TT) virus, which can be detected and sequenced in the blood of most humans and many other vertebrate species.",

For example, when hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, caused by a bunyavirus of rodents, Sin Nombre virus, was initially detected in 1993 in the Four Corners region of Western USA, it was found that rodents inside a house where people had been infected carried a virus identical in sequence to virus isolated from human cases. However, rodents caught at various distances from the house had increasingly variable genome RNA sequences, providing strong evidence that these rodents, deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), were the source of the infection. Subsequently more than 30 other hantaviruses, some of which also cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in humans, were isolated from rodents throughout North and South America. Each new virus seems to be associated with a different genetic variant of rodent host, and all rodents that carry the virus belong to the subfamily Sigmodontinae, unique to the American continent.",

For example, when Hendra virus first appeared in 1995 in Australia, causing the death of a horse trainer and 14 of his horses, antibody against the virus was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Then, in 1999, CDC was asked to investigate a newly emerged epidemic that had appeared in Malaysia, killing more the 100 people and causing disease in many pigs. Initially, it was suspected to be caused by a virus related to Japanese encephalitis virus, but a virus was isolated from the pigs that replicated in Vero cells, and reacted in an immunofluorescence test against the Hendra virus antiserum. This could subsequently be used on patient tissues to study the pathogenesis of the disease, and after comparison of the genome sequences of Hendra virus and Nipah virus they were found to be closely related and are now classified in the genus Henipavirus of the Paramyxoviridae.",

The new virus was called human bocavirus, and many research groups worldwide have now confirmed the presence of the virus, particularly in pediatric samples, although it is still not certain how important this virus is in causing morbidity and mortality. Their method also amplified a human coronavirus from the respiratory samples, and when sequenced this turned out to be HKU1, a recently emerged coronavirus detected by scientists at Hong Kong University. It is possible that a systematic search of human samples using such molecular techniques might reveal more hitherto unknown human viruses.",

This is especially true of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which rapidly spread following its emergence in the early 1980s to infect more than 40 million people worldwide by the end of the twentieth century. Because of its severe effects on the immune system, the virus leads to numerous other infections in the HIV-infected population. For example, picobirnaviruses, that had been detected in fecal samples from chickens and rabbits, were difficult to detect in human fecal samples until a cohort of men with AIDS was examined, and in these humans picobirnavirus was detected for the first time. Some rare diseases have become common in persons with AIDS. For example, the human polyomavirus known as JC virus can cause the rare brain disorder known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Normally, the virus remains dormant in the kidney, but in HIV-infected individuals the HIV-encoded transactivator Tat acts as a transactivator of JCV leading to PML which progresses to death within 4 months after infection. Other important virus infections which emerge in AIDS patients are human herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, and human herspesvirus 8, which causes Kaposi's sarcoma).",

These infected persons then traveled by air and spread the infection to more than 8000 individuals worldwide, 10% of whom died. The virus then apparently receded from the human population in July 2003.

The virus is excreted in the saliva of infected animals, and following infection it moves through the nervous system to attack the brain, causing aggressive behavior which results in the animal biting humans and animals with which it comes into contact and thereby spreading the virus infection. Fortunately, due to early work by Louis Pasteur, a vaccine was developed that protects humans or other animals from infection, and can also be given immediately post exposure, and the domestic dog population in the developed world is vaccinated and does not pose a risk to humans. However, in some developing countries, it is not uncommon for a rabid dog to bite and infect more than 25 people before it can be put down, and worldwide there are still some 30 000 human rabies deaths per year. Using molecular sequencing techniques, it is now possible to distinguish the genotypes of rabies viruses associated with different species of host, as the virus has become adapted through frequent transmission between members of the same host species. In the USA, there are six recognized terrestrial animal genotypes, in raccoons in eastern states, skunks in north-central states, skunks in southcentral states, coyotes in southern Texas, red foxes in Alaska, gray foxes in Arizona, and several genotypes associated with particular species of bat. In fact, most fatal cases of human rabies in the USA can now be traced to bats, which are often not detected when the person is bitten; so rabies is not suspected and vaccination is not undertaken until the disease has taken hold.",

Despite the fact that serious coronavirus diseases were well known in other vertebrates, such as feline infectious peritonitis and avian infectious bronchitis virus, it was not until the SARS epidemic that research on human coronaviruses led to the discovery of three new human coronaviruses -SARS, HKU1, and NL63/New Haven.",

When mosquito control was conducted using DDT, dengue fever virus was virtually eliminated from the Americas in the 1970s, but environmental concerns led to the widespread banning of the use of DDT, so that since the 1980s there has been a considerable expansion of dengue fever in South America, with the appearance of dengue hemorrhagic fever there for the first time. There is a real need to improve mosquito control measures to control this disease. Although there are prospects for a dengue virus vaccine, this is so far not available.",

The Ebola virus first emerged as the causative agent of viral hemorrhagic fever in two outbreaks occurring almost simultaneously along the Ebola river in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976. There were some 318 human cases in this episode with a mortality rate of 88%. Since that time, a number of smaller outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever affecting humans and monkeys were reported from West Africa, but although most infections have been associated with hunting and handling of great apes, the actual origin of the virus has never been ascertained. It is clear hat transmission of the virus requires close contact with an infected individual, and does not involve airborne transmission. Ebola virions are usually long filamentous sometimes branched forms with a uniform diameter of about 80 nm, and varying in length up to 14000 nm, from which they are called filoviruses, belonging to the family filoviridae.",

            "text": "Finally, one of the most important viruses that continue to emerge in different antigenic forms is influenza virus. The main reservoir of influenza viruses is in birds, and over the past century several pandemics of influenza have emerged, the most serious of which was in 1918. Pandemic strains usually arise by a process of antigenic shift, where one of the genes encoding the hemagglutinin and/or the neuraminidase of influenza virus is replaced by one from birds. New pandemics occurred in 1918 (H1N1 subtype), 1957 (H2N2 subtype), and 1968 (H3N2 subtype). Since 1968, there have been no new pandemics, but it is widely expected that another will occur. At the time of writing, there is worldwide concern that a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1 subtype), which has caused some human infections and deaths in persons in close contact with infected birds, might mutate or recombine to generate a virus which would be highly transmissible in the human population. Plans are being developed in many countries and by the WHO to try to prepare for such an event by generating possible vaccines against such a virus and stockpiling antiviral drugs.",
