In these molecules, the protein-coding sequences of a major late structural polypeptide are preceded by long leader RNAa, which In some cases are thousands of nucleotides long. These sequences map to different regions of the viral genome and in one instance are separated from the late gene by more than 100 kb of DNA. Moreover, the leader sequences map either upstream or downstream of the late gene, are transcribed from either DNA strand, and are fused to the late gene coding sequence via a poly(A) stretch. This demonstrates that vaccinia virus produces late mRNAs by tagging the protein-coding sequences onto the 3' end of other RNAa.",

            "text": "Vaccinia virus, a member of the poxvirus family, belongs to the small group of DNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Gene expression in vaccinia virus is temporally well regulated and occurs in two distinct phases. Early genes are transcribed before the complete uncoating of the viral DNA, and some encode enzymes that are subsequently used for DNA replication. Late genes encode most structural polypeptides and are expressed after DNA replication. Vaccinia virus thus offers a unique opportunity to study eukaryotic transcription and mechanisms of gene regulation that presumably have evolved independently from those of the host cell. All enzymes required for the production of mRNAs are carried in the virion (reviewed in Moss, 1985) and, although the mRNAs are made in the cytoplasm, they show such typical eukaryotic features as methylated caps (Wei and Moss, 1975) and poly(A) tails (Kates and Beeson, 1970) . The mRNAs produced early in infection have an average size of about 1500 nucleotides (Oda and Joklik, 1967; Cooper et al., 1981; Mahr and Roberts, 1984) . Furthermore, these molecules are not spliced (Wittek et al., 1980; Cooper et al., 1981) and processing at the 5' end has also been ruled out (Venkateaan and Moss, 1981) .",

Recent analyses (Bertholet et al., 1986; Hanggi et al., 1966) have revealed unexpected features of the putative promoter region of a strongly expressed late gene that encodes a major structural polypeptide of molecular weight 11,000 (11K gene). Surprisingly, very short stretches, of about 20 nucleotides, preceding the translation initiation codon are sufficient to regulate late gene expression. All mutations around the putative mRNA start site, however, have abolished transcription. In several late genes the putative transcription initiation site has been located within, or very close to, the highly conserved sequence TAAATG, which also includes the translation initiation codon (Weir and Moss, 1984; Bertholet et al., 1985; Hirt et al., 1986; Weinrich and Hruby, 1986) . Thus late mRNAs appear to have extremely short nontranslated leader sequences. In all these studies, however, the 5' ends of the mRNAs were mapped by the nuclease Sl procedure. In this communication we show that the 5' end of the 11K mRNA, as defined by this technique, does not represent the true 5'end. Instead, the protein-coding sequences of the late gene are preceded by long, polyadenylated RNAs.",

In addition, intense bands were seen around the position of 1500 nucleotides. This material was resolved into multiple bands upon agarose gel electrophoresis (not shown), indicating considerable length heterogeneity.",

Beyond this point, bands were observed in all four lanes but were most intense in the '7\" track, indicating that this region is rich in A residues (mRNA-like strand). In fact, at least 3-4 A residues immediately upstream of the 11K ATG translation initiation codon could be read. This experiment thus clearly demonstrated that the primer hybridized to the expected RNA but that the RNA contained additional sequences upstream of the 5' end defined by nuclease Sl analysis, and that this stretch was heterogeneous in length and possibly also in sequence.",

We wish to emphasize that cDNA clones were selected on the basis of two criteria only. First, clones were isolated by colony hybridization using as probe an EcoRI-Hindlll fragment of 135 bp from the very beginning of the 11K coding sequences (note that the EcoRl site starts at the G residue of the 11K ATG). Second, only those cDNA clones in which that EcoRl site was present were chosen for further analysis. All cDNA clones that fulfilled these criteria are shown schematically in Figure 2 , where they are compared with the corresponding genomic DNA around the 1lK gene. In addition to the EcoRl site, Hindlll and Clal sites characteristic of the 11K gene coding sequence and 3'flanking region were also present in all six cDNA clones. Furthermore, the four cDNA clones with long 3' flanking regions also had the expected BamHl site. Thus, whereas the sequences downstream of the EcoRl site are characteristic of the 11K gene and its 3' flanking region, this is not true for the sequences upstream of it. In this region the restriction maps of the cDNA clones differ from the corresponding region of genomic DNA. Furthermore, these upstream sequences vary considerably in length between different cDNA clones, ranging in size from less than 100 nucleotides to more than 2000 nucleotides (the latter for cDNA clone 9). The presence of short as well as long sequences upstream of the 11K ATG thus reflects the primer extension result. Moreover, the different restriction maps of the three long cDNAs (clones 3,8, and 9) suggest that these sequences differ.",

We reasoned that hybridization of cDNA-derived probes exclusrvely to RNA from infected cells would argue that the RNAs are of viral origin, although such a result would not exclude the possibility that they represent cellular RNAs that are induced upon virus infection. RNA was isolated from noninfected or infected cells and then hybridized to 32P-labeled probes isolated from the 5' end region, upstream of the 11K coding sequences of cDNA clones 3, 8, and 9 (see Figure 2 ). As a control, a fragment containing the coding region of the 11K gene and Yflanking sequences was also hybridized to various nitrocellulose-bound RNAs. Weak hybridization to RNA from uninfected cells was only observed when the filters were washed at low stringency ( Figure 3 ). In contrast, the probes from cDNA clones 3 and 8 hybridized strongly to both early and late RNA from infected cells. Whereas these probes hybridized somewhat more strongly to early than to late RNA, the opposite is true for the probe derived from cDNA 9. Finally, the probe specific for the 11K gene hybridized strongly to late RNA, as expected, but also to early RNA. This may be due to the presence of long early RNAs of unknown significance; these RNAs have been found to be transcribed from various parts of the vaccinia virus genome (Wittek et al., 1980; Cooper et al., 1981) , and they may traverse early or late genes on the same or opposite DNA strand.",

On the basis of the previous experiments, however, it is clear that the S'end also contributes to the overall size heterogeneity. Total early and late RNAs were also hybridized to probes p3, p8, and p9 derived from the leader RNAs. Particularly with probes p8 and p9, smears were seen with late RNA, demonstrating that late RNAs encoded in these parts of the genome also vary in size. Contrary to what one might have expected, probe pllK did not detect smears that comigrated with those detected with the leader-RNA-derived probes. This is not surprising since, as shown by cDNA cloning, the length heterogeneity contributed by the 5' end of the 11K RNA population results from fusion of different leader RNAs to the 11K coding region. In addition, a given leader RNA as represented by probe p3, p8, or p9 may be fused to various other RNA% of which the 11K RNA population presumably only represents a small subset.

To rule out the possibility that the unusual structure at the Vend of the 11K mRNA as revealed by these experiments is due to an artifact generated by reverse transcriptase, we searched for means independent of this enzyme to confirm the observed structures. A nuclease Sl protection experiment was performed using as hybridization probe a DNA fragment derived from cDNA clone 1 ( Figure  7A ). This fragment was 5' end-labeled at the Hindlll site within the coding sequences of the 11K gene, and it contained a stretch of 30 T residues (complementary strand) immediately upstream of the AAATG genomic sequence (see also Figure 8 ) comprising the 11K translation initiation codon. This sequence is preceded by 15 C residues resulting from the cDNA cloning procedure, and the fragment was isolated after cleavage at the Pstl site just upstream of this sequence. A second probe consisted of a Xbal-Hindlll fragment derived from genomic DNA and was also labeled at the Hindlll site. The genomic ( Figure  78 , lane 5) and cDNA-derived probes (lane 8) were analyzed either directly or after hybridization to early RNA and Sl treatment (lanes 1 and 2). As expected, no protected fragments were observed with early RNA and either probe. Note that in contrast to the probe used for hybridization to RNA (Figure 3) , the Sl probe was labeled on one strand only and therefore did not detect the early RNA transcribed from the DNA strand opposite to the 11K gene (Wittek et al., 1984) . Total late RNA from infected cells protected fragments of 127 and 128 nucleotides of the genomic probe, consistent with the previous experiments, which demonstrated that the sequence complementarity between the genomic DNA and 11K mRNA ends just upstream of the 11K ATG codon. Significantly, protected fragments of about 158 nucleotides were observed with the cDNA-derived probe, as well as some reannealing of the probe (Figure 78, lane 4) . These bands can best be explained by the presence of a poly(A) sequence upstream of the 11K ATG codon. The ladder pattern in the lower part of the gel probably results from nuclease Sl cleavage at internal positions within the poly(A) sequence. However, very little, if any, material was observed at the position of the protected fragments obtained with the genomic probe, suggesting that the majority of the 11K mRNA molecules contain such a poly(A) stretch upstream of the translation initiation codon.",

A Clal DNA fragment consisting of about 700 bp of DNA downstream of the 11K ATG codon and about 600 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon was isolated. This DNA was hybridized to 11K RNA purified by hybrid selection to DNA of the 11K coding region, and the resulting molecules were analyzed by electron microscopy. Many molecules with a \"Y\" structure characteristic of the two hybrids shown in Figure 8 were examined. Four different regions can be distinguished, two of which were constant in size and two of which varied in size. We interpret the different regions as follows: Region 1, which is constant in size, represents the single-stranded DNA of the 11K 5' flanking sequence. Region 2 varies in size from 890 to 6070 nucleotides and represents the leader RNA. The double-stranded region 3 results from hybridization of the 11K coding sequence and 3' flanking sequence to the corresponding region of the RNA. Finally, region 4 is the 3'portion of the RNA. The fact that this region again varies considerably in length is not unexpected from the 3' length heterogeneity of late vaccinia virus transcripts (see Moss, 1985) . Thus the results obtained by electron microscopy are consistent with the unusual structure of the 11K mRNA proposed on the basis of the previous experiments.",

The restriction sites present in cDNA clones 3, 8, and 9 were first mapped within the large Hindlll fragments to which the corresponding cDNA-derived probes had hybridized (see also Figure 4 ). Figure 9A shows the map positions of these sequences within the Hindlll fragments F, 8, and I. These are shown in the correct left-to-right orientation with respect to the conventional orientation of the genome (Figure 98) . Thus, the sequences in cDNA clone 3 map to the left-hand half of the Hindlll F fragment, whereas the 11K gene is located at the extreme right-hand end (Wittek et al., 1984) . The sequences in cDNA clone 8 map at the lefthand end of the 30 kb Hindlll B fragment, and those present in clone 9 map toward the right of the Hindlll I fragment. Furthermore, from the 5'-to-3 polarity of the leader RNAs established by restriction analysis of the cDNA clones (see also Figure 2 ) and as indicated by the poly(A) se-A. EPsBl C  BB  E  c CCEH  I  III,  ,I,  , I I I Figure 9A ), it is obvious that the leader RNAs in cDNA clones 3 and 9 are transcribed from the leftwardreading strand of the vaccinia virus genome ( Figure 9B ).

We have also found cDNA clones that contain only the poly(A) stretch, and thus lack the sequences preceding it. It is possible that these molecules result from premature termination of reverse transcription during cDNA cloning. It is known, at least for the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, that long homopolymer stretches are not easily copied (Smith, 1980) . This interpretation is also consistent with the results obtained by electron microscopy, where we have found no evidence for RNA molecules that had only very short sequences upstream of the 11K coding sequences. On the contrary, most molecules observed possessed even longer leader RNAs than those found by cDNA cloning. Both procedures also confirmed the 3' length heterogeneity of late RNA. We have sequenced the S'ends of five cDNA clones and have found stretches of between 30 and 100 A residues (not shown). These ends, therefore, most likely represent the true 3'ends and did not result from priming at internal positions in the RNA molecules. On the other hand, it is clear from the data presented here that the 5' end also contributes significantly to the overall length heterogeneity of late RNA.",

            "text": "Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the bizarre structure of the 11K mRNA concerns its translation. In most eukaryotic mRNAs the AUG closest to the 5' end is used for translation initiation (Kozak, 1978) , although exceptions to this rule, particularly for mRNAs of viral origin (reviewed in Kozak, 1988) have been described. If the 11K polypeptide is indeed translated from the mRNAs described in this paper, the translation initiation codon would be located in several cases thousands of nucleotides downstream of the 5' end. Furthermore, the leader sequences certainly contain several AUGs. One might therefore expect a poor translation efficiency of the 11K sequences. However, the opposite appears to be true. From the abundance of the polypeptide, the 11K gene is judged to be one of the most strongly expressed vaccinia virus genes, since its product contributes about 10% to the total protein mass present in purified virions (Sarov and Joklik, 1972; Moss, 1974) . Furthermore, in vitro translation of hybrid-selected RNA, which was used to map the 11K gene (Wittek et al., 1984) RNA that was first selected by hybridization to the cDNA of one of the leader RNAs and then on the 11K coding sequences, suggests that such chimeric RNAs may indeed be functional 11K mRNAs. Another interesting question is whether the leader RNA sequences are also translated. At present this question cannot be answered, since in the previous mapping of the 11K gene (Wittek et al., 1984) we used immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translation products of hybrid-selected RNA to identify the 11K polypeptide.",

A nonviral example is the mRNAs of trypanosomes, which contain an identical 35 nucleotide leader sequence (reviewed in Borst, 1986; Van der Ploeg. 1986 ). It is not clear how the leader is added to the body of the mRNA, but frans splicing appears to be the most likely mechanism (Murphy et al., 1986; Sutton and Boothroyd, 1986) . We can only speculate on the mechanism by which the long polyadenylated RNAs are fused to the late coding sequences in vaccinia virus. Splicing of a single, very long precursor molecule can be excluded, since the sequences added to the body of the late mRNA are transcribed from either DNA strand and are located either upstream or downstream of the 11K gene. A priming mechanism can be envisaged in which the poly(A) sequence of the donor RNA interacts with sequences on the DNA coding strand. An alternative hypothesis is that the two RNAs are joined together by ligation.",

Although it cannot be excluded that the upstream sequences act as promoters, we prefer an alternative model in which the highly conserved 5'-TAA-ATG-3' sequences represent processing sites at the RNA level. It is well established that very long transcripts are made particularly late in infection, and from both DNA strands (reviewed in Moss, 1985) . These transcripts might represent precursor molecules from which the late coding sequences are excised by a site-specific endoribonuclease. Interestingly, an enzyme that appears to possess the required properties has been isolated from vaccinia virions and partially characterized (Paoletti and Lipinskas, 1978) . Clearly, further work is needed to understand the mechanism by which donor and acceptor RNAs become joined. However, in comparison with trypanosomes, vaccinia virus represents a relatively simple system that should greatly facilitate the unraveling of this unusual mechanism of RNA production.",
