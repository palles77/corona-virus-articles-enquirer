METHODS: Twenty patients with PE and 20 age and gender matched patients without PE as controls were enrolled into the present study in the same period. The diagnosis of PE was based on the clinical manifestations and findings on imaging examinations. Acute arterial and/or venous thrombosis was excluded in controls. The whole human genome oligo microarray was employed for detection. Statistical analysis was performed with t test following analysis of very small samples of repeated measurements and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. RESULTS: Genomic data showed no damage to vascular endothelial cells in PE patients. Genomic data only found increased mRNA expression of a small amount of coagulation factors in PE patients. In the PE group, anticoagulant proteins, Fibrinolytic system and proteins related to platelet functions only played partial roles in the pathogenesis of PE. In addition, the mRNA expressions of a fraction of adhesion molecules were markedly up-regulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed the genes with down-regulated expressions mainly explain the compromised T cell immunity. Symptomatic VTE patients have compromised T cell immunity. CONCLUSION: The damage to vascular endothelial cells is not necessary in the pathogenesis of VTE, and only a fraction of factors involved in the shared coagulation cascade are activated. Genomic results may provide a new clue for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of VTE.",

After 1990's, clinical report of incidence of PE are sharply increased yearly in China (3) . After 1990's, clinical reports of PE are sharply increased yearly in China (3) . In other Asia Ivyspring International Publisher regions, such as Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, the number of reported PE cases is also increasing (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . There are nearly 900,000 new PE cases in USA every year (9) , 78,000 new cases in Canada, 100,000-200,000 cases in Europe including France, Italy, Spain, Britain, Germany, and 47,000 cases in Australia every year (10).

Therefore, we compared gene expressions of these VTE related factors in patients with PE and without PE. Among the expressions of coagulation factor genes, only gene expressions of factor \u2166 and FIBCD1 were significantly elevated in patients with PE compared with patients without PE. As for genes of other coagulant factors, the expression value of patients with PE was either not significantly different or less than those patients without PE in comparison. There was no significant difference between two groups of patients in gene expression of anticoagulant proteins. And so was in gene expression of fibrinolytic factors except plasminogen Urokinase receptor (PLAUR, Fig.1 ). L-selectin, ITGAL and ICAM-1 are the adhesion molecules originated from different family, mainly distributed on the surface of lymphocytes. ICAM-1 is the ligand of ITGAL which is member of integrin family. Significantly elevated mRNA expression of these adhesion molecules in PE group indicate activated adhesion function of white blood cells. However, mRNA expression of P-selectin (mainly distributed on the surface of ECs and platelets) and E-selection (mainly distributed on the surface of activated ECs) are not elevated in PE group which indicate venous endothelial cells are not impaired in patients with PE (Fig.2) . In expression of platelet aggregation related genes, only 2 genes (GP6 and PAFAH1B2) were significantly elevated in the patients with PE. Compared to patients without PE, the expressions of 3 in 7 genes of platelet adhesion function were significantly increased in patients with PE.

In addition, we also found that the number of CD3+T cells and CD8+T cells was dramatically reduced in a series of acute PE patients and cytological findings also supported the results from genomics studies on PE patients (27) .
