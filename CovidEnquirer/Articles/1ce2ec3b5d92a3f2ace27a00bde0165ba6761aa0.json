Epidemiological studies have shown that preventing seasonal influenza virus infection by vaccination increased the risk of infection with A(H1N1) pdm09 virus in Canada and Japan [17] [18] [19] . Similarly, in a randomized controlled trial, influenza vaccine recipients displayed higher rates of infection with noninfluenza respiratory viruses, compared with unvaccinated subjects [20, 21] . This effect is observed only within specific periods [7, 16] , estimated to be weeks to months [20, 22] . The interval between initial infection and subsequent exposure may explain the different findings between epidemiological studies [7, 17] .",

When ferrets were first infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, for every day that A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected following challenge, the start of B virus shedding was delayed by 1.82 days (95% CI, .31-3.33; P = .031; Figure 5A ), and the peak of B virus shedding was delayed by 1.68 days (95% CI, .66-2.69; P = .014; Figure 6A ). When ferrets were first infected with influenza B virus, this effect was reduced. For every day the primary influenza B virus infection continued after A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge, the peak of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus shedding was delayed by 0.68 days (95% CI, .10-1.25; P = .025; Figure 6B ), with some evidence for a delay to start of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus shedding ( Figure 5B ). There was no evidence of delay when ferrets were first infected with influenza B virus and then challenged with A(H3N2) virus, or vice versa ( Figure 5C and 5D and Figure 6C and 6D). These data show that temporary immunity depends on the continued presence of the primary virus and the respective virus (sub)types. There was no statistical support for an impact on the kinetics of the primary virus infection (shedding was not shortened), regardless of the timing of the secondary virus challenge ( Supplementary  Figures 3-6) .",

Outcomes varied according to both virus combination and the interval between primary infection and challenge. Prior infection with both antigenically related and unrelated viruses provided protection from subsequent infection or modified the infection kinetics of the challenge virus. For relatively short exposure intervals, these effects required the continued presence of the primary virus following challenge. For heterosubtypic influenza A viruses, when primary infection and challenge were separated by at least 1 week, the challenge virus was rapidly cleared. The outcome depended on the virus combinations, indicating a hierarchy of influenza viruses inducing different levels of temporary immunity. In this study, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was most effective at inducing a temporary state of immunity, followed by influenza B virus, and, last, the A(H3N2) virus. These data may explain why viral interference is observed only in some epidemiological studies and during some influenza seasons [7, 8, 17] , but further studies using other influenza strains are required to confirm these observations.",

At intervals of <1 week, innate immune antiviral mechanisms may prevent or delay secondary viral infections. These mechanisms are antigen independent, so they may be common to both influenza A and B viruses. Upon infection with influenza virus, expression of type I interferons is upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released from cells of the innate immune system [39] . Intrinsic antiviral factors, such as the IFITM and IFIT families and MxA, inhibit influenza virus fusion and replication by directly interacting with viral proteins or viral RNA [40, 41] . Recent studies have also demonstrated that nucleoprotein from influenza B virus can interact with nucleoprotein from influenza A virus and limit its polymerase activity [42, 43] , suggesting that viral intermediates may also inhibit coinfections. Together, these mechanisms may limit the amount of virus shed by making epithelial cells refractory to infection, mopping up free virus, phagocytosing infected cells, or preventing/reducing viral replication. Many of these antigenindependent mechanisms reach their peak levels at the peak of virus shedding (L. Carolan and K. Laurie, unpublished observations); in this study, virus shedding peaked 2-3 days after infection and persisted for 5-6 days, consistent with the timing observed for temporary immunity. This timing also implies a lag of 1-2 days following primary infection before innate immunity and intrinsic antiviral factors reach maximum levels, providing a possible explanation for the observed window of coinfection.",

Previous studies, in which infections with heterosubtypic influenza A viruses were separated by 8 weeks, showed a similar shortening of the duration of virus shedding [28] . Cross-reactive epitopes between influenza A and B viruses have been reported in the fusion peptide of hemagglutinin (HA) and the enzymatic region of neuraminidase [30] .

Viral fitness, whereby one virus can outgrow another and even successfully be transmitted to a new host, may be important [45] . In another study, when ferrets were coinfected with A(H1N1)pdm09/A(H1N1) or A(H1N1)pdm09/A(H3N2) viruses, only the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was transmitted to naive contact ferrets, showing a clear fitness advantage [46] . HA receptor specificity may also contribute. The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in our study can infect cells of both the URT and lower respiratory tract, whereas the A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses used in this study infect only the URT following intranasal infection (data not shown). This suggests a broader receptor specificity for the HA of A(H1N1)pdm09, compared with the H3 or influenza B HA proteins. Experiments are planned to investigate these aspects on our model. Our findings imply that temporary immunity between unrelated viruses lasts for 1 week or less in the ferret. While this period is short in comparison with observed interference in epidemiological or modeling studies [20, 22] , individual level influences on susceptibility and transmissibility will predictably have consequences over longer time frames at the level of populations. We used a direct inoculation model to ensure that the challenge was controlled and that the dose of virus was consistent. A low dose of virus was used to mirror the kinetics of a natural infection, but the duration of temporary immunity may be different in an aerosol transmission model and more closely match those periods seen in humans. Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) have been shown to induce the innate immune response [47] , and thus the ability of LAIV to induce viral interference to homologous and hetero(sub)typic viruses in rapid time frames is also of interest.",

In humans, a lack of adaptive immunity in specific age groups was most likely the major mechanism behind the dominance of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus upon its emergence in 2009 [48] . However, our study suggests that temporary immunity may also have contributed to the observed dominance of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and higher levels of infection seen in many countries in 2009. Induction of a nonspecific localized temporary state of immunity may provide a strategy to control infection with emerging influenza viruses in the absence of an antigen-matched inactivated vaccine.",
