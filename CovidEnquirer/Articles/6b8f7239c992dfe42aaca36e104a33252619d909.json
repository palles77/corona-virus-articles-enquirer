An investigator attended the lobby daily to screen patients with symptoms for SARS. Patient/attendant load, patient flow, medical staff working practices and position in the EMOPD were observed. Infection control measures such as fumigation and cleaning were noted, as was the EMOPD laboratory function, use of personnel protection and display of information on infectious diseases. A total of 162 (7.4%) of the 2165 patients surveyed had respiratory symptoms but no cases of SARS were found. The flow of patients and their attendants was not systematic. No laboratory tests for SARS were available, and no educational material on SARS was displayed. The EMOPDs in key hospitals need be able to screen for infectious diseases, especially in view of the threats from SARS and Avian influenza.",

It caters for 1.2 million outpatients, 50 000 inpatients and 40 000 emergencies per year. Infectious diseases are a common reason for medical consultations, and the threats posed by them have been receiving considerable attention at national levels. 1 In February 2002 a few cases of a mysterious plague-like disease were admitted to PGIMER. The diagnosis was initially missed, and the patients were not isolated until a formal diagnosis was made. By that time, infection had been transmitted to a visitor to another patient in the ward; a 28-year-old man, who later died. The need to screen all patients with suspected infectious disease in the medical emergency outpatient department (EMOPD), and for control and prevention of infection, was recognized. Two community physicians were deputed to assess the situation, and an outbreak control committee was formed. This arrangement lapsed when the plague situation was controlled.",

Many countries have tried to incorporate surveillance in their emergency medical services, and the role of national government in strengthening infectious disease control in an emergency has been debated. 5 In India an Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) has been implemented in many states to focus on early detection and control of spread of infectious diseases. A draft contingency plan for avian influenza has been included in the IDSP training of medical officers, but the IDSP lacks the necessary focus for the EMOPD. 5 In our study, the WHO protocol was used to classify the cases as having suspected or probable SARS. Suspect patients were straightaway shifted to the isolation room (in a different block, 300 m from the EMOPD). However, the chances of infection spreading to patients/attendants during transfer of the patient remained. Grouping infectious patients in a centralized location in an early stage of infection may reduce the extent of an epidemic. 6 Lingappa et al. also suggested that the hospital setting was the primary amplifier of SARS transmission. 7 Table II shows the SARS control measures that ought to have been taken and what was actually done during the survey period. 8 The standard management protocol was not followed. The casual approach was evident by the fact that collection of a single blood sample was done on day 1 of onset of symptoms in a suspected SARS case e a procedure with no diagnostic value.",

To prevent spread of infection, a permanent 'triage/control room' should be established near reception for screening patients. This should include a cubicle for examination of critically ill infectious disease patients. If a doctor/nurse suspects that s/he is dealing with a highly infectious disease, s/he should have an option to isolate the suspected cases in an isolation room/ward located nearby. (b) Function. This could be changed without undue disturbance and cost, provided that the building has sufficient flexibility. 12, 13 The flow of patients and visitors can be easily regulated. A sign should be placed at the entry of EMOPD instructing people where to report first. Proper directions to patients/attendants should be displayed inside the hall. A systematic patient flow control mechanism should be installed and a screening system for patients' attendants should also be initiated. Only one attendant (at the most two, in case of serious emergency) should be allowed into the EMOPD. A public health nurse (PHN) along with an emergency medical officer e surveillance and screening (EMO-S&S) should be posted permanently in the EMOPD. The PHN should conduct a daily census of infectious and notifiable diseases. Patients arriving in EMOPD should first be examined thoroughly to rule out the chance of patients with acute infectious disease from mixing with the OPD crowd. Only the patients screened by the EMO-S&S should be allowed to enter along with one attendant. Restriction of patient movement is crucial for ensuring infection control. Until a larger EMOPD is constructed, overcrowding and lack of scope of flexibility for functional changes will continue to compromise infection control measures (Figure 1 ).",

Use of fitness-tested personal protective equipment in all patient-care areas has been shown to prevent nosocomial spread of SARS. 10 In our study, provision of the recommended N-95 masks was delayed due to late procurement. Such personal protective equipment should be permanently available in an EMOPD.",

They should collaborate with the infection control committee, disaster management committee, local board of health, and other providers to develop protocols and policies. They should hold disaster drills in which they must handle infectious patients. EMOPD staff, particularly the triage nurses, need training in the early recognition of presenting symptoms of infectious diseases. 15 WHO has established a Global Alert and Response Network to monitor and track infectious diseases outbreaks, which should allow EMOPDs to anticipate future problems. 16 ",
