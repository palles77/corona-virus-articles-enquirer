However, reduction in serial lactate concentration by greater than or equal to 30% 4 to 8 hours and by greater than or equal to 50% 24 hours after admission was significantly associated with survival. 5 A creatinine concentration greater than 2.0 mg/dL (176.8 mmol/L) was also associated with a lower likelihood of survival. 2 Hyperproteinemia may be present with severe dehydration, although mild to severe hypoproteinemia is also seen as a result of gastrointestinal protein loss.",

Horses may be pyrexic, depressed, and anorexic before developing diarrhea and gastrointestinal signs. Neutropenia, hypoproteinemia, dehydration, hemoconcentration, and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities may all be appreciated. C difficile is challenging to culture so false-negative test results are possible and CDI is therefore likely underdiagnosed. Enzyme immunoassays have been developed for the identification of TcdA and TcdB, although their performance is highly variable. More recently, molecular detection methods following bacterial culture have been used to identify genes for TcdA and TcdB in the feces of horses. 15, 16 Aside from supportive care, specific treatments for CDI remain controversial. Evidence exists that Saccharomyces boulardii, a nonpathogenic yeast, can destroy TcdA. 17 Di-tri-octahedral smectite binds TcdA and TcdB in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and may be useful to limit the toxemic effects of these toxins. Metronidazole is commonly used to treat C difficile colitis in horses to reduce the C difficile population, whereas the normal flora is restored. Although metronidazole resistance has been documented in cases of human infection, it is not a prevalent feature in equine CDI. 14 However, even targeted antimicrobial therapy can have deleterious effects on the microbiota and may disrupt or delay recolonization with beneficial bacteria. Recently, fecal transfaunation, also known as fecal microbial transplantation or fecal bacteriotherapy, has re-emerged as a treatment of CDI in humans and horses. Proximal duodenal infusion with donor feces was significantly more effective than standard vancomycin therapy in humans with recurrent CDI. 18 Anecdotal evidence supports the use of fecal microbial slurries via nasogastric intubation for treatment of acute cases of equine CDI. 19 Further investigation is needed to provide evidence-based support.",

It has been isolated from the gastrointestinal flora of normal horses, although reported prevalence rates are low, ranging from 0% to 8% in healthy adult horses. 13 It is classified into five types (A to E) based on exotoxin production. C perfringens type A is the isolate most commonly cultured from healthy and diarrheic adult horses. b2 toxin, suspected to be produced by a subtype of C perfringens type A, has been associated with clinical C perfringens infections in horses with colitis. 20,21 b-toxin produced by types B and C has direct cytotoxic effects resulting in enterocyte necrosis, mucosal ulceration, and hemorrhagic diarrhea. Enterotoxin, produced by both type A and type C strains, creates pores and alters membrane permeability, leading to cell necrosis. The poreforming toxin NetF has also been recently identified as a major virulence determinant and has been associated with necrotizing enteritis in foals and dogs.",

ECoV is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Betacoronavirus-1 genus. Transmission is believed to be via the fecal-oral route. Infection begins in the small intestine. Lesions include necrosis and sloughing of enterocytes in the intestinal villi, dilated crypts filled with necrotic debris, and mucosal inflammation. 25, 26 Hematologic abnormalities include leukopenia, characterized by neutropenia and/ or lymphopenia. 25 The most common clinical manifestations of ECoV infection include anorexia, lethargy, and fever. 22, 25 In a report of 59 clinical cases, diarrhea and colic were only seen 20% and 7% of affected horses, respectively. 25 Neurologic signs associated with ECoV infection have been described and seem to be associated with hyperammonemic encephalopathy with Alzheimer type II astrocytosis in the cerebral cortex. 26 Diagnosis of ECoV colitis is currently based on PCR of feces, gastrointestinal contents, or tissue samples. In one study there was no significant statistical difference in absolute ECoV quantification between positive sick and positive healthy horses. However, the overall agreement between clinical status (horses demonstrating clinical signs of ECoV infection) and ECoV-positive status on PCR was 91%. 25 Therapy is directed at supportive care and prevention of hyperammonemic encephalopathy.",

This acute, potentially fatal disease is an infection with the gram-negative, obligate, intracellular, bacterial endosymbiont Neorickettsia risticii. 27 The bacterium survives in digenic trematodes, such as Acanthatrium and Lecithodendrium spp. 28 Trematodes use freshwater and lymnaeid snails as first intermediate hosts and aquatic insects (mayflies, caddisflies, damselflies, dragonflies, and stoneflies) as second intermediate hosts. 29, 30 The definitive hosts of these trematodes are brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus and Myotis lucifugus). Horses become accidental hosts of digenic trematodes when they inadvertently ingest infected intermediate hosts. N risticii is released from the trematode and once inside the equine gastrointestinal tract it invades and replicates within the colonic epithelial cells. It also translocates into blood monocytes (equine monocytic ehrlichiosis), mast cells, and tissue macrophages. A seasonal rise in disease incidence is seen during warmer months.",

In one retrospective of 44 horses with PHF, laminitis was identified in 36%, of which 88% were affected in all four feet. 30 Horses present with clinicopathologic abnormalities typically seen in equine colitis. The same study identified that serum creatinine and urea nitrogen concentrations, hematocrit, red blood count, blood hemoglobin concentration, band neutrophils, serum aspartate transaminase, serum CK, and anion gap were significantly higher in nonsurvivors. Further, serum chloride, serum sodium, and duration of hospitalization were significantly lower in nonsurvivors. 30 Diagnostics for PHF include serum indirect fluorescent antibody testing, enzymelinked immunosorbent assay, culture of N risticii from buffy coat or feces, and PCR on whole blood or feces. Both exposure and vaccination lead to many false positives with antibody testing and in one study 16% of healthy horses had a rise in paired indirect fluorescent antibody titers, 31 so antigen testing is recommended. Culture of N risticii remains the gold standard of diagnosis, although PCR was reported to identify 81% of culture-positive, naturally infected horses. 32 Tetracycline antibiotics effectively kill N risticii and oxytetracycline administration to horses with clinical signs of disease has been positively associated with survival. 30 Additional therapy is supportive and includes fluid replacement and laminitis prevention. Particular attention should be paid to fluid resuscitation in hypovolemic horses either before, or in conjunction with, administration of nephrotoxic drugs (oxytetracycline and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]). Several killed and adjuvants vaccines have been marketed.

However, the 2012 Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended against the use of HES in sepsis. 43 As a result, the European Medicine Agency concluded that HES solutions should not be used in patients with sepsis or critically ill patients and the Food and Drug Administration placed a boxed warning on HES for increased mortality and renal-replacement therapy in 2013.",

Plasma may also be less likely to result in acute kidney injury or coagulation abnormalities in critically ill patients.

In one retrospective, horses presenting with colitis that were previously treated with antimicrobials were 4.5 times less likely to survive than those not treated. 2 Antimicrobial use affects the fecal microbiota, 45, 46 which is likely already disturbed. 47 Procaine penicillin, ceftiofur sodium, and trimethoprim sulfadiazine administration all impacted the fecal microbiota in healthy horses, and changes often persisted for 25 days. 46 The identification or clinical suspicion of the presence of certain pathogens warrants targeted antimicrobial use. Oxytetracycline is considered the treatment of choice for horses with PHF. 30 Metronidazole is recommended for the treatment of C difficileassociated diarrhea (CDAD) in humans and is often used to treat horses with confirmed or presumed CDAD. However, Magdesian and colleagues 15 demonstrated an association between metronidazole administration and identification of metronidazole-resistant C difficile strains. Although metronidazole resistance in horses with CDIs is not considered clinically important at this time, these strains are suspected to be more virulent. 14 To this effect, horses with metronidazole-resistant strains of C difficile had an increased risk of mortality compared with horses infected with metronidazole-susceptible strains. 15 Antimicrobial therapy may be warranted in acute diarrhea cases demonstrating severe neutropenia and/or evidence of septic foci, such as in the lungs, liver, or jugular veins. Antimicrobial drug selection should be based on culture and susceptibility patterns of the causative agents whenever possible. However, in cases of acute undifferentiated diarrhea in horses, antibiotics may be contraindicated because of further disruption of the microbiota. Furthermore, increased shedding of Salmonella was associated with the administration of antimicrobials 48 and multidrug resistance in Salmonella spp is an emerging threat. Therefore, judicious use of systemic antimicrobials is strongly recommended.",

Both flunixin meglumine and ketoprofen significantly decreased the production of thromboxane B 2 production by blood monocytes in vitro. 50 Low doses of flunixin meglumine (0.25 mg/kg) suppressed thromboxane and prostaglandin production in horses challenged with endotoxin. 51 Although a dose of 1.1 mg/kg is also antiendotoxic, the lower dose may be associated with fewer side effects, especially in cases with renal insufficiency. Administration of NSAIDs to horses with endotoxemia is a mainstay of treatment. Albeit in practice, treatment is initiated following challenge with endogenous endotoxins, whereas experimentally, benefits were noted when NSAIDs were administered before endotoxin exposure. Clinicians often administer flunixin meglumine every 8 hours to control the clinical signs of endotoxemia while limiting adverse side effects, such as renal papillary necrosis and gastrointestinal ulceration. 49 Polymyxin B is a cationic polypeptide antibiotic that forms a stable complex with the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide. Once bound, lipopolysaccharide does not interact with equine inflammatory cells, thus preventing initiation of the proinflammatory cascade. 49, 52 Initial high doses reportedly produced signs of neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. When administered to healthy horses at doses between 1000 and 5000 IU/kg, polymyxin B inhibited 75% of endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor activity 53 and no alterations in either creatinine 53 nor urine g-glutamyltransferase-tocreatinine ratios 52 were noted. However, polymyxin B should be used with caution in hypovolemic and azotemic animals and should always be administered diluted in isotonic fluids.

Currently, distal limb cryotherapy (applied from hoof to carpus for 72 hours continuously) is the only method of prevention of laminitis in horses with systemic inflammation that has been validated. 67 Other feasible laminitis prevention techniques include treating the primary disease process, anti-inflammatory therapy (NSAIDs, pentoxifylline), inhibition of neutrophil and platelet margination (low-molecular-weight heparin, pentoxifylline, aspirin, and possibly corticosteroids), antioxidant therapy (dimethyl sulfoxide), and physical support of the sole with easing of breakover. 68 Bacterial sepsis has the potential to lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation secondary to widespread inflammation. Salmonellosis has been associated with thrombotic events in ewes and disseminated intravascular coagulation in horses. 8 In a controlled clinical trial in humans with sepsis, heparin improved hypercoagulable states, reduced time in the intensive care unit, and decreased days on mechanical ventilation. 69 In a retrospective study of 360 horses that underwent colic surgery, the prevalence and grade of laminitis was lower in horses treated with lowmolecular-weight heparin. 70 Although unfractioned heparin is often used for prophylaxis of coagulation disorders, low-molecular-weight heparin was associated with fewer side effects, such as decreased packed cell volume (PCV), catheter-site complications, and decreased platelet counts. 71 Based on limited data, heparin therapy may be indicated in as a prophylactic measure in horses with severe sepsis.",

A low-bulk diet, such as a complete pelleted feed, good-quality grass hay, or alfalfa, is recommended for horses with acute colitis. 72 Offering fresh grass may stimulate the appetites of anorectic horses, although large amounts of grass may contribute to the development of laminitis or colic signs. Parenteral nutrition is beneficial in severely catabolic cases of acute colitis that do not tolerate enteral feeding. Parenteral nutrition is indicated in diarrheic patients with anorexia persisting more than 48 to 72 hours and in pregnant and lactating mares.",
