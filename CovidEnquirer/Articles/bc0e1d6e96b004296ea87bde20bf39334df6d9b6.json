The NCCN is a not-for-profit organisation, aims to advance the overall quality of cancer care by improving many aspects such as improving the care of patient with cancer, cancer research and education. It offers various assets that support the clinicians in their decision-making while managing patients with cancer. 1 NCCN Guidelines are one of these resources, which were developed by using an evidence-based consensus process. 2 Based on published data, the authors hypothesised that improving adherence to NCCN Guidelines will have positive effects on patients' management and outcome. [3] [4] [5] [6] In our institution, as a result of case discussions at the thoracic tumour board (TTB), we realised that we have a guidelines-practice gap, thus we initiated this project aiming to quantify the level of variation in our domain of practice (baseline data), then the next step was to bridge this gap by conducting a generic and specialised educational session about the findings of the audit, and about how to access/use the NCCN Guidelines. We believe that doing so will be reflected positively in improving the quality and safety of the provided services to patients with lung cancer.",

Numerous disease-specific studies had been carried out studying the extent of recommendation compliance with NCCN Guidelines. A study on head and neck cancer reported a high rate (96%) of adherence to the guidelines, 9 while other studies reported rates as low as 37% for ovarian cancer 3 and 35% for pancreatic cancer. 5 Another study examined the relationship between evidence-based guideline adherence and the follow-up monitoring period over 1.5 years. This study had been conducted on patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated in US community oncology practices. It was found that treatment with guideline-based regimens correlated with a significantly longer follow-up monitoring period. Furthermore, it also revealed that the rates of guideline adherence were 75.0% and 61.3% for the first-line and adjuvant treatment groups. 10 In investigating clinical variation in the delivery of healthcare, one study listed several sources of variation: among them was the over-reliance on subjective judgement. Physicians may rely on their personal clinical experience as the foundation for the recommendations they make for treating patients. 11 Other sources of variation could be related to patients' factors and preferences. Due to the unique patient and/or care-setting characteristics, there will always be a degree of appropriate variation in the practice of medicine, even for patients with the same diagnoses. 12 Thus, the main reason for guideline development is not to eliminate practice variation but to standardise the process, reduce the probability of error and monitoring any variation in practice.",

Having this variety of specialties in one place made the TTB a suitable place to provide an in-depth specialised educational information and discussion about any controversial case. The TTB was also a suitable place for the treating physicians to provide explanation/justification for any case that has guideline non-compliance.

Assure that each new case is presented to the lung cancer tumour board within 30 days of pathological diagnosis, as several deviations could have been avoided by discussing the case in the tumour board. 3. Improve the documentation process. Do 1. The baseline results were shared during our monthly departmental meetings. 2.
