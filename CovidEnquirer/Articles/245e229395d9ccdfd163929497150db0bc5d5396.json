A lack of planning and the decentralised nature of the health-care system meant that disruptive control measures had to be put in place to control the outbreak. Several of the control strategies were difficult to implement and resulted in considerable confusion, fear, and costs. We discuss these difficulties and offer suggestions for improving outbreak planning.",

            "text": "Little could one predict in November 2002 that early reports of an atypical pneumonia from Guangdong, China, would represent the start of the first international outbreak of the 21st century, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). By March 2003, SARS had spread to several countries, including Canada. Toronto would later be recognised as the site of North America's largest outbreak of this disease. 1 It took 4 months of substantial control measures at the local, national, and international levels to contain the epidemic. In the end, SARS affected over 8000 patients in 29 countries, with 774 deaths worldwide. Toronto had 251 probable cases with 43 deaths. 2 The province of Ontario was ill-prepared to deal with an infectious disease threat on such a scale. [3] [4] [5] In Canada, the provision of health care, including public health, is a provincial responsibility. However, the financial and operational responsibility for public health had increasingly been shifted to municipalities such that, at the time of the SARS outbreak, funding was shared equally between the two levels of government. This funding shift created a decentralised public-health system, with the province's 37 public-health units operating quite independently of each other. 3 Ontario is the only Canadian province that does not have a regionalised health-care system so that each Ontario hospital functions semi-autonomously as a private not-forprofit organisation. Hospitals operate independently of public health, rehabilitation, and long-term-care facilities.",

The government of Ontario declared a state of emergency on March 26, 2003 , and gave the authority to manage the outbreak to an emergency management instrument, the Provincial Operations Centre (POC). 8 Plans and protocols in the form of government \"directives\" were developed and sent to all Ontario health-care facilities on a regular basis. A scientific advisory committee to the POC drafted directives relating to infectious-diseases control. These highly detailed protocols were meant to be implemented immediately upon receipt. Since SARS was a novel pathogen, and there was no preconceived blueprint to deal with an infectious-diseases outbreak of this magnitude, outbreak-management protocols were developed in \"real time\". This meant the protocols could not be widely disseminated for discussion before release, and potential problems were often not detected until attempts were made by facilities to put them into practice. Similarly, the directives also had to be issued before obtaining complete information. For example, early on in the SARS outbreak, neither the causative agent nor its mode of transmission were known, yet health-care workers had to be provided with detailed instructions on how to protect themselves and others.",

It has been suggested that many of the measures taken to interrupt the chain of infection were excessive. 9 However, it must be emphasised that the POC was faced with a yet-to-be-identified infectious threat, and decision making had to be made within the context of incomplete knowledge. Of note, control measures used were similar to those of other countries, and to those recommended by national and international bodies. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Whereas, as a whole, these emergency decisions were successful in controlling the outbreak, they also created repercussions that may not have been apparent or considered when these outbreak-focused policies were initially developed. The intent of the following discussion is to describe the implications of certain rapid policy decisions to provide a balanced perspective to decision makers faced with similar situations in the future. It is not meant to criticise these decisions, since all decisions have repercussions and emergencies require a rapid response. Possible solutions and considerations for the management of future outbreaks are outlined in table 2.",

SARS symptoms were non-specific, case definitions were hampered by limited understanding of epidemiological links and the lack of a confirmatory test, and the mode of transmission had not yet been determined. The financial impact of providing this isolation equipment was considerable. During the first 8 weeks of the outbreak, the University Health Network spent over Canadian $3 million on isolation equipment alone. 15 However, health-care facilities did not have immediate access to the required supplies. In particular, submicronfiltering masks (eg, N95 masks) were in variable supply, because before SARS such masks were used only for patients with airborne infections and hence most facilities would have only kept a limited supply. With 211 hospitals in Ontario alone requiring these supplies, Canadian suppliers rapidly ran out of stock. There was no pre-existing supply stockpile, and our mask supplies were obtained from foreign manufacturers. Because SARS was a worldwide threat, there was great difficulty in acquiring masks from other countries, since foreign governments understandably wanted to keep such supplies for their own citizens.",

Other issues included men wearing beards for cultural or religious reasons who would not shave to pass fit testing; health-care workers who developed allergic reactions to masks; and the mistaken belief from some staff that, once alternate protective devices such as positive airway pressure respirator (PAPR) hoods were offered for those with beards and allergic reactions, that N95 masks were inferior. The requirement for fit testing implied that SARS transmission was often airborne, which increased the concerns of frontline nursing staff who called for enhanced enforcement of fit testing and respirators with high filtration efficiency. 18, 19 By focusing on airborne transmission rather than the far more common contact and droplet routes of SARS transmission, there was a concern that staff might ignore important control measures such as hand washing and avoiding self-contamination, and actually increase their risk of acquiring infection.",

Having donned gowns and gloves, frightened staff would be reluctant to remove them between patients, and hand washing between patients might decrease. There is no evidence that SARS was transmitted by this behaviour, but there is indirect evidence derived from measurements of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission that this could occur. During the period of universal barrier precautions, the rate of hospital-acquired MRSA was unchanged or increased compared with the pre-SARS and post-SARS periods in four Toronto hospitals that all treated SARS inpatients (unpublished observation). Conventional wisdom would have predicted a decrease in hospital-acquired MRSA during this period.",

During the first wave of the Toronto outbreak, hospitals with greater than 500 beds were required to provide a 30-bed negative-pressure isolation unit. 34 Most, if not all, Ontario hospitals were ill-prepared for such a requirement. Other hospitals were required to open SARS assessment clinics, which were to be rapidly operational. Issues of adequate staffing, personal protective equipment, and proper construction were left to the individual hospitals to resolve. Hospitals dealt with the isolation requirement in different ways: some installed temporary facilities using HEPA filtration units, whereas others elected to construct permanent banks of rooms with dedicated ventilation systems. Some facilities that have constructed permanent facilities have expressed concern that they now may be considered natural candidates to have a leading role in a future infectious disease epidemic, a role they do not wish to fill. A new strategy employing four SARS isolation hospitals was attempted during the second wave of the Toronto outbreak. 35 The rationale for this strategy was to help protect the capacity of the health-care system by providing specialised units with dedicated staff, resources, and supplies. The SARS hospitals were to be the first to receive supplies and were to have special funding agreements for staff. Although the bulk of the SARS cases during the second wave were indeed cared for in these hospitals, this was largely a result of prior nosocomial transmission resulting in a large number of SARS inpatients within two of these hospitals, rather than subsequent transfers from non-SARS hospitals.",

Needless to say, this decision provided incentive to comply with quarantine requests as well. 42 As with health-care workers who were prevented from working as a result of SARS, the Ontario government retroactively enabled quarantined individuals to have access to benefits. 28 It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the effectiveness of quarantine in controlling SARS. In general, however, quarantine will be most effective in situations involving highly infectious diseases where those quarantined are compliant. Although public-health officials once posted quarantine notices to ensure compliance, this is no longer done out of privacy concerns.

This lack of a plan, combined with prolonged neglect of public-health and infection-control programmes and a decentralised health-care system meant that extraordinary measures had to be applied to control the outbreak. 43 It has been estimated that the total cost of the SARS outbreak to the Toronto-area economy was over $1 billion. 44 To the credit of those involved, extraordinary measures were quickly devised and disseminated, and the outbreak was contained.",
