Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a standard method for quantification of gene expression studies. However, the reliability of qRT-PCR data critically depends on proper selection of reference genes. In the study, using two different analysis programs, geNorm and NormFinder, we systematically evaluated the gene expression stability of six candidate reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, B2M, RPL4, TBP, and PPIA) in samples of whole blood and PBMC with or without poly I:C stimulation. Generally, the six candidate genes performed a similar trend of expression stability in the samples of whole blood and PBMC, but more stably expressed in whole blood than in PBMC. geNorm ranked B2M and PPIA as the best combination for gene expression normalization, while according to NormFinder, TBP was ranked as the most stable reference gene, followed by B2M and PPIA. Comprehensively considering the results from the two programs, we recommended using the geometric mean of the three genes, TBP, PPIA and B2M, to normalize the gene expression of whole blood and PBMC with poly I:C stimulation. Our study is the first detailed survey of the gene expression stability in whole blood and PBMC with or without poly I:C stimulation and should be helpful for investigating the molecular mechanism involved in porcine whole blood and PBMC in response to poly I:C stimulation.

It has become the standard method for quantification of gene expression studies. In case of qRT-PCR, the use of reference genes as internal controls is the most common method for normalizing mRNA data (Huggett et al., 2005) . The reference gene is a stably expressed gene that is experimentally verified in given species and tissues under given experimental conditions. However, an increasing number of reports have shown that the expression of some frequently used internal reference genes may vary significantly under different experimental conditions (Vandesompele et al., 2002; Nygard et al., 2007; Facci et al., 2011) . If the chosen reference gene has a large expression fluctuation among samples tested, the normalization will lead to erroneous gene expression profiles of the target gene of interest. Therefore, the selection of the most stable gene or set of genes as internal controls is a critical step to control the variability among samples for quantitative gene expression studies with a sensitive qRT-PCR technique.",

In brief, geNorm calculates the gene expression stability measure M for a reference gene as the average pairwise variation V for that gene with all other tested reference genes. Besides the M values, geNorm also calculates average expression stability values of remaining control genes during stepwise exclusion of the least stable control gene. Finally, to determine the optimal number of control genes for normalization, by the program, we calculated the pairwise variation V n /V n+1 between two sequential normalization factors NF n and NF n+1 containing an increasing number of reference genes. NormFinder uses the model-based strategy to estimate not only the overall expression variation of the candidate normalization genes, but also the variation between sample subgroups of the sample set, i.e. nonstimulation group and stimulation group in the study. The output of the program provides a stability value for each gene, which is a direct measure for the estimated expression variation enabling the user to evaluate the systematic error introduced when using the gene for normalization.",

But to date, there is no consensus on which method should be used to examine reference gene expression stability. In particular, Radoni et al. (2005) suggested that ranking lists of the genes tested was tool-dependent. A comparison of different algorithms of reference gene selection allows a better evaluation of the most reliable controls and reduces the risk of artificial selection of co-regulated transcripts. Therefore, in the present study, we used two statistical approaches, geNorm and NormFinder, to evaluate the gene expression stability of the six reference genes, and also compare the results obtained using these two programs. Based on the geNorm programs, the most stable reference genes in both whole blood and PBMC were PPIA and B2M. Combination of the two genes can obtain rather small M values for the samples of whole blood (0.299) and PBMC (0.490). As experimental data from the geNorm developers have shown that stably expressed genes typically exhibit mean M values lower than 0.5 in relatively homogeneous sample panels (Hellemans et al., 2007) . Thus, the combining of the two genes, PPIA and B2M, is appropriate for normalization of gene expression of whole blood and PBMC. On the other hand, based on the NormFinder, TBP was ranked as the most stable reference gene in both whole blood and PBMC, while genes B2M and PPIA were the second and third ones. This discrepancy is probably due to the different algorithms used in the two programs. Though the most stable genes were different, the first three most stable genes were the same as evaluated by the two programs.",

Based on the cut-off value of 0.15 proposed by geNorm program, four reference genes are necessary to obtain the lowest control genes in the tested samples of both whole blood and PBMC. In practice, it is not always possible to measure multiple reference genes due to limited sample availability and cost. Additionally, the cut-off value of 0.15 is an empirical value and should not be taken as a too strict cut off value, as it is already suggested by the geNorm manual itself. Therefore, we recommend using the geometric mean of the first three stable genes, TBP, PPIA, and B2M, to normalize the gene expression of whole blood and PBMC with poly I:C stimulation.",
