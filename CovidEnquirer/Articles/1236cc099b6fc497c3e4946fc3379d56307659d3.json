These complex organs, which function in excretion, metabolism, secretion, and regulation, are susceptible to disease insults that affect the four major anatomic structures of the kidney: the glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, and vasculature. Because of the limited ways that renal tissue can respond to injury and the limited patterns of injury, in severe and prolonged disease, the endpoint will be similar-chronic renal disease and failure. Interdependence between components of the nephron also are responsible for producing a narrow range of repeatable injury patterns, which students can come to recognize on gross or histologic assessment.",

            "text": "Macroscopically, kidneys are organized functionally and anatomically into lobules. Each lobule represents collections of nephrons separated by the medullary rays. Renal lobules should not be confused with renal lobes. Each lobe is represented by a renal pyramid ( Fig. 11-1 ). Among domestic animals, carnivores and horses have unilobar kidneys. Porcine and bovine kidneys are multilobar, but only bovine kidneys have external lobation ( Fig. 11-2) . A diffuse fibrous capsule that in normal kidneys can be easily removed from the renal surface covers the kidneys. The renal parenchyma is divided into a cortex and medulla (see Fig. 11 -1). The corticomedullary ratio is usually approximately 1 : 2 or 1 : 3 in domestic animals. The ratio varies among species; for example, those adapted to the desert have a far larger medulla and thus a corticomedullary ratio that can approach 1 : 5. Normally the cortex is radially striated and dark red-brown except in mature cats, in which the cortex is often yellow because of the large lipid content of tubular epithelial cells. The renal medulla is pale gray to tan and has a single renal papilla, as in cats; a fused, crestlike papilla (renal medullary crest), as in dogs, sheep, and horses; or multiple renal papillae, as in pigs and cattle. The medulla generally can be subdivided into an outer zone, that portion of the medulla close to the cortex, and an inner zone, that portion closer to the pelvis. Papillae are surrounded by minor calyces that coalesce to form major calyces, which empty into the renal pelvis ( Fig. 11-3) , where urine collects before entry into the ureters.",

Microscopically, the glomerulus is a complex, convoluted tuft of fenestrated endotheliallined capillaries held together by a supporting structure of cells in a glycoprotein matrix, the mesangium (see Fig. 11 -5). The entire glomerulus is supported by mesangial matrix that is secreted by the mesangial cells, a type of modified pericyte. Mesangial cells are pluripotential mesenchymal cells, which are contractile and phagocytic (see E-Figs. 11-5 and 11-6) and capable of synthesizing Postmortem evaluation of the kidney has three components. First, the prosector should examine the location of the kidneys in the carcass to determine that they are of normal size and position. Second, the prosector should remove the kidneys one at a time by severing the renal artery and gently pulling the kidney outward maintaining the ureter attachment. The ureter can be examined while still attached to the kidney to determine that it is intact and of normal and uniform size and shape. With the kidney still attached, a segment or the entire length of ureter can be opened to determine whether the mucosa is normal or abnormal. Once it is determined that the ureter is normal, the kidney can be removed. Third, kidneys should be carefully examined on the capsular and cut surfaces. Longitudinal incision of each kidney from capsular surface and poles through the pelvis should be done exposing the kidney halves. The capsule can be removed from each half by grabbing the cut edge of the capsule with forceps or between the thumb and edge of the knife and stripping the capsule from the surface. Tightness with which the capsule adheres to the underlying cortex should be noted, especially if obvious fibrous adhesions attach the capsule to the subcapsular cortical surface. The cortical surface should then be examined as to contour, foci of discoloration, and smoothness or granularity. If lesions are seen, the prosector should cut the kidney at the lesion site to determine if it is merely in the capsular surface or the depth to which it extends into the kidney parenchyma. The cut surface of the sagittal section should then be examined noting the size and mucosal surface of the renal pelvis, the contour and appearance of papillae or medullary crest, the cortex to medulla ratio, color, capsular surface contour, and cortical and medullary striated appearance. Careful examination of the cortex is important, and it can be aided by using a surgery light or hand magnifier. Normal glomeruli are usually not visible except in the horse kidney, where they appear as pinpoint red dots. The prosector should note any reductions or accentuations in the cortical striations, accentuation of glomeruli, and discolored streaks or foci. For routine histopathology, a thin transverse section (approximately 0.5 cm thick) from both kidneys is removed and placed in formalin. Sections should contain capsular surface, cortex, medulla, and pelvis.",

            "text": "The renal tubular system (in the order of flow of urine) consists of a proximal tubule, loop of Henle, and distal tubule (see Fig. 11 -4). The tubules connect to the renal pelvis at the distal end of the collecting ducts, and the whole structure-including the renal corpuscle, renal tubules, and collecting ducts-is referred to as the uriniferous tubule (see Fig. 11-4) . The proximal and distal convoluted contribute to the charge differential of the GBM. Foot processes from adjacent visceral epithelium interdigitate to form filtration slits between them (see . Filtration slit diaphragms are composed of nephrin, a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which controls slit size by its connection to podocyte actin. The glomerular filtration barrier is a layer formed by endothelial cells, basement membrane, and visceral epithelial cells (podocytes). Its main function is to filter plasma to maintain ionic and osmotic homeostasis in the blood. The filtration barrier is relatively impermeable to larger macromolecules, such as albumin and hemoglobin, and larger proteins, such as immunoglobulins. However, small and medium-sized solutes (ions), such as sodium and potassium, and other soluble moieties, such as sugar molecules, pass through the barrier as glomerular filtrate, which then travels through the renal tubules and the collecting duct to form urine. Certain molecules within the filtrate, such as sugars, can be resorbed in the tubules and returned to the plasma as needed to maintain homeostasis. In the electron micrograph, note the central electron-dense layer (lamina densa) of the glomerular basement membrane covered by lighter, more electron-lucent inner and outer layers (lamina rara interna and lamina rara externa, respectively). The small spaces visible between foot processes of visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) are filtration slits, through which plasma filtrate passes into the uriniferous space. Scale bar in the electron micrograph (lower right corner) = 500 \u00b5m in length. ( tubules are linked by the loop of Henle, which is divided into a descending and an ascending limb. The wall of the descending limb and initial portion of the ascending limb is thin (permeable), whereas the cortical portion of the ascending limb is thick (impermeable). Microscopically, the proximal tubule is lined by columnar epithelial cells that have a microvillous (brush) border. This arrangement greatly increases their absorptive surface, and their numerous intracellular mitochondria supply energy for the various secretory and absorptive functions. Distal tubules, collecting tubules, and the loop of Henle are lined by cuboidal epithelial cells that contribute to the concentration of urine by absorptive and secretory activities.",

Interlobular arteries branch from the arcuate artery and extend into the cortex. They have no anastomoses, making them susceptible to focal ischemic necrosis (infarct) as in any organ with end arteries. Microscopically, interlobular arteries have small branches that become afferent glomerular arterioles, which enter the renal corpuscle and subsequently exit at the vascular pole as efferent glomerular arterioles (see Fig. 11 -7). Efferent arterioles supply the blood for the extensive network of capillaries that surround the cortical and medullary tubular system of the kidneys, known as the peritubular capillary network. The latter surrounds cortical segments of the tubules and then drains into the interlobular vein, arcuate vein, interlobar vein, and ultimately the renal vein. In addition, the vasa recta are formed from the deeper portions of the peritubular capillary network and descend into the medulla and around the lower portions of the loop of Henle before ascending to the cortex and emptying into venous vessels that connect to the interlobular and arcuate veins.

( renal functional capacity is abruptly impaired approximately 75% or more, such that the kidneys fail to carry out their normal metabolic and endocrine functions, acute renal failure can ensue. It is important to remember that the glomerulus, tubules, collecting ducts, and capillary blood supply in each nephron are closely interrelated, both anatomically and functionally. Alterations in tubular structure or function influence glomerular structure and function and vice versa. For example, necrosis or atrophy of renal tubules results in loss of function of the affected nephrons and secondary atrophy of the glomerulus. In addition, because most of the capillary blood supply to tubules is through postglomerular capillaries, a reduction in glomerular blood flow consequently reduces the blood supply to the tubules.

Acute renal failure can be caused by (1) tubular necrosis from infectious microbes, such as bacteria (Leptospira spp., Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Proteus spp.) or viruses (infectious canine hepatitis virus and canine herpesvirus); (2) obstructive nephropathy from urolithiasis, transitional cell neoplasms of the lower urinary system, or trauma; (3) renal ischemia with tubular necrosis from occlusive vasculitis/vasculopathy caused by bacteria, bacterial toxins, or tumor emboli; (4) tubular necrosis from nephrotoxic drugs, such as aminoglycoside-based antimicrobial drugs or antineoplastic drugs; and/or (5) tubular necrosis from chemicals, such as ethylene glycol and heavy metals.",

Both size-dependent and charge-dependent filtration are possible because of the porous structure of capillary walls, which is a function of endothelial fenestrations, laminin, polyanionic proteoglycans, fibronectin, entactin and other glycoproteins, and filtration slits between adjacent visceral epithelium. Thus the normal glomerulus restricts many proteins and charged molecules from being filtered into the uriniferous (Bowman's) space and proximal tubular lumen whereby allowing permeability to water, proteins <70 kDa, and small solutes. The fluid that filters through the glomerulus into the urinary space is called glomerular filtrate, and it arises after passage through the glomerular filtration barrier. This ultrafiltrate of plasma (primary urine), which contains water, salts, ions, glucose, and albumin, passes into the uriniferous space and then empties into the proximal convoluted tubule at the urinary pole to traverse through and be acted on by the tubular system.",

The proximal tubule is continuous with the loop of Henle that is in close physiologic and anatomic association with the peritubular capillary network (within the cortex) and the vasa recta (within the medulla). The loop of Henle, via a countercurrent mechanism and Na + /K + -adenosine phosphatase (ATPase) pumps, absorbs Na + and Cl \u2212 ions, producing a hypotonic filtrate that flows into the next portion of the nephron-the distal convoluted tubule.

The pathogenesis of the underlying renal lesion can be unknown and slowly progressive or can be scarring resulting from an acute insult (see Renal Fibrosis [Scarring] ). Severely scarred kidneys lack the ability to concentrate urine, resulting in polyuria and polydipsia. Anorexia with chronic progressive weight loss commonly occurs as well as other signs of uremia, such as vomiting and seizures. In the diseased kidney, production of erythropoietin, a stimulant of erythropoietic maturation, is reduced and contributes to nonregenerative anemia, as does uremia-associated increased erythrocytic fragility. Most animals in renal failure have hyperphosphatemia and low to normal calcium concentrations, although variations exist, depending on species and stage of the disease. Alterations in calciumphosphorus metabolism in the uremic animal are a hallmark of chronic renal failure and result from a complex set of events as outlined in the following: \u2022 When the glomerular filtration rate is chronically reduced to less than 25% of normal, phosphorus is no longer adequately secreted by the kidneys and hyperphosphatemia results. \u2022 Because of the mass law interactions between serum calcium and phosphorus, ionized calcium concentration in serum is reduced as a result of precipitation of calcium and phosphorus. \u2022 Reduced ionized serum calcium concentration stimulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, causing calcium release from \u2022 Obstructive renal tubular damage \u2022 Tubulointerstitial inflammation, edema, or fibrosis Animals that die of acute renal failure often do so because of the cardiotoxicity of elevated serum potassium, metabolic acidosis, and/ or pulmonary edema. Hyperkalemia results from decreased filtration, decreased tubular secretion, and decreased tubular sodium transport. Cell lysis and the extracellular shift of fluid in acidic environments also contribute to the increased serum potassium concentrations. These alterations are reflected clinically by signs such as oliguria or anuria, vomiting and diarrhea, and ammoniacal-smelling breath, and an array of nonrenal lesions described later and can be detected and monitored with biochemical tests of serum, plasma, and urine for azotemia and uremia.",

Therefore, if small numbers of tubular epithelium undergo apoptosis, a reepithelization of the tubular epithelial lining is accomplished efficiently by adjacent viable tubular epithelial cells, which by mitotic division fill the epithelial gap. The cells that are lost slough into the lumen to form cellular casts within the lumens of renal tubules. Acute Tubular Degeneration. More severe generalized loss of tubular epithelial lining cells is repaired by proliferation of the remaining viable epithelial cells over an intact tubular basement membrane to form a low cuboidal rather than a mature columnar epithelial lining. This appears as an ectatic proximal tubule. Restitution of renal function eventually results, despite the presence of replacement low cuboidal epithelium, which is not identical to the tubular lining cell (with microvilli) present before the injury. The exact mechanism of this return to function is not entirely known. The main determinant of this regenerative ability is the viability of tubular basement membranes, which are retained more consistently after toxic rather than ischemic insults. Tubular Regeneration. Because the regenerative process is reliant on many factors for its success, things often go awry. Examples of adverse outcomes include the following: \u2022 Focal loss of basement membrane scaffolding allows a bulge defect to occur where the regenerative population of proliferating tubular epithelial cells coalesces to form well-differentiated syncytial cells (giant cells) at certain levels of the tubule. \u2022 Regenerative epithelial cells fail to regain all cytoplasmic structural aspects of the original columnar epithelial cells (e.g., microvilli and luminal enzymes) because of a failure to fully differentiate, and thus function may be affected. \u2022 If there is excessive tubular epithelial loss, the potential for regeneration is lost and repair proceeds by replacement fibrosis and scarring. \u2022 Reperfusion is necessary for cell viability following ischemia, but reperfusion injury occurs when activated endothelial cells produce proinflammatory mediators, such as reactive oxygen species, proteolytic enzymes, and cytokines, which result in further renal injury. Evidence indicates that epidermal growth factor secreted by distal convoluted tubules mediates the tubular repair process. The sequence of events in tubular regeneration after necrosis has been well documented in experimental model systems using mercuric chloride in mice, rats, and rabbits. In that system, morphologic evidence of regeneration of proximal convoluted tubules is seen within 3 days after a toxic dose. At this time, basement membranes are partially covered with low cuboidal to flattened and elongated epithelial cells that are more basophilic than normal because of the increased concentrations of cytoplasmic ribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum producing protein for repair. Nuclei are hyperchromatic and mitotic figures are present. Regenerating tubules do not function normally because they lack both a brush border and normal tubular membrane function, and this is evident clinically as polyuria. Normal-appearing tubular epithelium subsequently reappears between 7 and 14 days after toxin exposure. Normal renal can regenerate but whole nephrons are not capable of regeneration. Thus the outcomes for the nephrons vary from hypertrophy to repair.",

Prolonged ischemia can produce necrosis of epithelium of the proximal and distal convoluted tubules, the loops of Henle, and the collecting ducts throughout the cortex and, to a lesser extent, the medulla. Glomeruli are resistant to ischemia and often remain morphologically normal, even when ischemia is prolonged. Initially, proximal tubular epithelium is swollen, and the cytoplasm is vacuolated or granular and intensely eosinophilic, all features indicative of necrosis . In such cells, the nuclear changes are pyknosis, karyorrhexis, or karyolysis. Necrotic tubular epithelium is subsequently sloughed into tubular lumens resulting in dilated, notably hypocellular tubules that contain necrotic cellular debris and hyalinized or granular casts.",

A polarized renal proximal tubule cell with a well-developed actin cortical cytoskeleton is shown on the left. Also shown is attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) via integrins. Following ischemic injury there is extensive disruption, redistribution, and aggregation of the actin cytoskeleton resulting in loss of microvilli structure, blebbing of microvilli into the lumen, detachment of cells from the ECM, and opening of junctional complexes (JC). Injured proximal tubule cells can undergo primary repair and recover directly into a polarized epithelial cell. Cells can also go through an undifferentiated phase followed by redifferentiation, or cells can die either rapidly via necrosis or in a much slower programmed manner known as apoptosis. The primary route of cellular repair involves direct recovery. The percentage of cells reverting to an undifferentiated state or dying depends on the severity of the injury and the location within the kidney. During ischemia, alterations in the actin cytoskeleton involve disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with redistribution and aggregation of actin throughout the cytoplasm. Consequently, notable alterations occur in cytoskeletal-surface membrane interactions. Loss of cell-cell adhesion, cellmatrix adhesion, and polarity of surface membrane proteins during ischemia play a role in the diminished glomerular filtration rate that is the hallmark of ischemic acute renal failure.

Proposed mechanisms for the decrease in GFR that occurs during ischemic acute renal failure include afferent arteriole vasoconstriction, back leak of glomerular filtrate, and tubular obstruction. All three of these mechanisms relate to ischemia-induced alterations in proximal tubule epithelial cells. Deranged proximal tubule handling of sodium leads to a high delivery of sodium to the macula densa, which in turn causes afferent arteriole vasoconstriction via tubuloglomerular feedback. Afferent arteriole vasoconstriction reduces glomerular capillary pressure and therefore GFR. Altered cell-cell adhesion results in an open tight junction that leads to increased paracellular permeability and subsequent back leak of glomerular filtrate from the tubular lumen into the extracellular space and ultimately into the bloodstream. Disrupted cell-matrix adhesion and abnormal cell-cell adhesion leads to cellular cast formation, which obstructs the tubular lumen and causes increased tubular pressure resulting in diminished or no GFR. or noninfectious cause and is acute, subacute, or chronic in its duration. Interstitial nephritis is traditionally associated with a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate; however, other types of leukocytes can also be present. In many of these diseases, the inflammatory cell infiltrates are visible only microscopically, are not associated with renal failure, and are generally inconsequential (examples are canine ehrlichiosis and equine infectious anemia). When the renal interstitium is the site of moderate to severe, grossly visible, interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrates and fibrosis, renal failure can occur. The renal interstitium is the fibrovascular stroma that surrounds the nephron and is significantly involved in renal diseases, whether this is of primary interstitial origin as in interstitial nephritis or Lymphofollicular Inflammation. Lymphofollicular inflammation is the most common response to Leptospira infection of the kidney. Severe multinodular lymphocytic inflammatory reaction is confined to the cortex. The reaction subsides slowly and inflammatory cells decrease in numbers and the degree of fibrosis increases. Similarly, with chronic recurrent bouts of pyelonephritis, lymphocyte-rich inflammatory infiltrates are noted within the interstitium.",

After ischemia and reperfusion, morphologic changes occur in the proximal tubules, including loss of the brush border, loss of polarity, and redistribution of integrins and sodium-potassium adenosinetriphosphatase to the apical surface. Calcium, reactive oxygen species, purine depletion, and phospholipases probably have a role in these changes in morphology and polarity and in the subsequent cell death that occurs as a result of necrosis and apoptosis. There is a sloughing of viable and nonviable cells into the tubular lumen, resulting in the formation of casts and luminal obstruction and contributing to the reduction in the glomerular filtration rate.

Interstitial inflammation occurs as the result of ascending urinary tract infections (pyelonephritis), systemically derived infections of tubules and interstitium, toxins, or secondary to injury of tubules or glomeruli. Common acute lesions of the interstitium in response to toxins and tubular necrosis include edema, hemorrhage, and inflammation characterized by infiltration of neutrophils. As lesions become subacute to chronic, neutrophils become less prominent, and in several diseases, infiltrates of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells predominate. With chronic injury to or after atrophy of nephrons, fibrosis of the interstitium can be severe, resulting in notable reduction in nephron function and accentuation of renal disease.",

The loss of the continuity of the basement membrane prevents orderly tubular epithelial cell regeneration, which can be followed by interstitial fibrosis.

Rarely, emboli may occlude the renal artery, causing infarction of the entire kidney. Sometimes, emboli occlude the interlobar/arcuate arteries, causing infarction of triangular (in cross section of the kidney) segments of the cortex and medulla. Most commonly, emboli obstruct smaller vessels (e.g., interlobular arteries), causing infarcts involving only the renal cortex. In general, renal infarction can occur because of thrombosis resulting from endothelial damage of glomerular capillaries associated with a vascular disease (as in Alabama rot in greyhounds; see .

Microscopically, in an acute infarct, nephrons (including tubules, glomeruli, and interstitium) in the central zone of the infarct are necrotic . At the periphery of the infarct, only the proximal tubules, because of their high metabolic rate, are necrotic; the glomeruli tend to be spared. After approximately 2 days, the margin of the necrotic zone contains an inflammatory infiltrate consisting largely of neutrophils and fewer macrophages and lymphocytes. Capillaries adjacent to the necrotic area are notably engorged with blood (hyperemia). Healing of the infarcted area occurs by lysis and phagocytosis of the necrotic tissue and replacement by fibrous connective tissue, which matures to a discrete scar. At autopsy (syn: necropsy), healed scarred areas are visible as pale white to gray contracted depressions from the capsular surface, and they range from linear to broad depending on the size of the acute infarct. Septic infarcts are initially hemorrhagic, but because of the conforming to a zone of cortical parenchyma supplied by the site of the obstruction. From the capsular surface, infarcts are irregular and reflect the red or pale colors of the wedge-shaped infarct seen on cut surface. Occlusion of small interlobular arteries results in infarcts that are initially slightly swollen and red because of hemorrhage ( Fig. 11-19 , A) and later develop a pale yellow-gray center of coagulation necrosis within 2 or 3 days because of lysis of erythrocytes and loss of hemoglobin ( Fig. 11-19 , B). Pale infarcts are usually surrounded by a peripheral red zone of congestion and hemorrhage along with a pale margin because of a surrounding zone of leukocytes ( Fig. 11-19 , C). Although less common, hypoxic renal necrosis as the result of venous occlusion and/or infarction is seen occasionally, and venous infarcts retain their hemorrhagic appearance longer than infarcts resulting from arterial occlusion because of the continued arterial blood flow into the area. Because of the loss of parenchyma, during healing infarcts are depressed below the cortical surface and later become pale and shrunken as a result of fibrosis ( Fig. 11-19 , D).",

A familial tendency for renal aplasia has been observed in Doberman pinscher and beagle dogs.

Renal cysts are spherical, thin-walled, variably sized distentions principally of the cortical or medullary renal tubules and are filled with clear, watery fluid. Congenital renal cysts can occur as a primary entity or in cases of renal dysplasia. The pathogenesis of primary renal cysts is not entirely understood. Cysts are likely derived from normal or noncystic segments of the nephron, most commonly the renal tubules, the collecting ducts, and Bowman's (urinary) space. Although genetic mechanisms can be involved in the pathogenesis of renal cysts, experiments with toxic chemicals indicate that genetic predisposition is not a requirement. The following four mechanisms of renal cystic dilation are considered plausible: \u2022 Obstruction of nephrons can cause increased luminal pressure and secondary dilation (called cystic dilation when it is well-developed). \u2022 Modifications in ECM and cell-matrix interactions result in weakened tubular basement membranes allowing saccular dilation of tubules. \u2022 Deranged function of renal tubular cilia in genetic polycystic disease resulting in tubular epithelial hyperplasia with production of new basement membranes, increased tubular secretion, and increased intratubular pressure causes development of enlarged, dilated tubules. \u2022 Dedifferentiation of tubular epithelial cells results in loss of polarity of cells with abnormal cell arrangements in tubules, reduced tubular fluid absorption, increased intratubular pressure, and dilation of tubules. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and several mechanisms often work in concert to create renal cysts.",

Congenital polycystic kidneys occur sporadically in many species but can be inherited as an autosomal dominant lesion in pigs and lambs and inherited along with cystic biliary disease in Cairn and West Highland white terriers. The lesion, termed polycystic kidney disease (PKD), is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait in families of Persian cats and bull terriers. In addition, PKD is diagnosed sporadically in numerous exotic and domestic animal species. Although less well-characterized in animals than in human beings, this autosomal dominant, highpenetrance, heritable condition is related to mutations in one or more genes (PKD-1 and/or PKD-2) and altered function of the related proteins, principally polycystin-1 and polycystin-2. Manifestation of tubular cysts occurs after mutation of both alleles of these genes, the first of which is a germline mutation, and the second is somatic mutation. Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 are transmembrane proteins important in cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions and calcium channeling. In addition, these proteins work together in renal tubular cells and are associated with renal tubular cell cytoplasmic membranes and cilia and are important in cases grossly or microscopically. In cattle and pigs, the number of renal papillae in the hypoplastic kidney can be compared with those in a normal kidney. Hypoplastic kidneys from pigs and foals have a notable reduction in the number of glomeruli. In foals, for example, 5 to 12 glomeruli are present per low-power field in affected kidneys compared with 30 to 35 glomeruli per low-power field in normal adult kidneys.

Although ectopic kidneys are usually structurally and functionally normal, malposition of the ureters predisposes them to obstruction, which results in secondary hydronephrosis. Fused (horseshoe) kidneys result from the fusion of the left and right cranial or left and right caudal poles of the kidneys during nephrogenesis. This fusion results in the appearance of one large kidney include persistence of appropriate quantities of immune complexes in the circulation, glomerular permeability, the size and molecular charge of the soluble complexes, and the strength of the bond between the antigen and antibody (avidity). Small or intermediate complexes are the most damaging because large complexes are removed from circulation through phagocytosis by cells of the monocyte-macrophage system in the liver and spleen. An increase in local glomerular vascular permeability is necessary for immune complexes to leave the microcirculation and deposit in the glomerulus. This process is usually facilitated via vasoactive amine release from mast cells, basophils, or platelets (see Fig. 11-27, A) . Mast cells or basophils release vasoactive amines because of the interaction of the immune complexes with antigen-specific IgE on the surface of these cells, by stimulation of the mast cells or basophils by cationic proteins released from neutrophils, or by the anaphylatoxin activity of C3a and C5a.

ICGN can be associated with specific chronic viral infections, such as feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV); chronic bacterial infections, such as pyometra or pyoderma; chronic parasitism, such as dirofilariasis; autoimmune diseases, such as canine systemic lupus erythematosus; and neoplasia . In addition to the role of persistent infections, a familial tendency for development of ICGN has been described in a group of related Bernese mountain dogs.",

Other ultrastructural changes commonly seen are loss, effacement, or fusion of visceral epithelial cell (podocytes) foot processes, cytoplasmic vacuolation, retraction and detachment of visceral epithelium, and infiltrates of neutrophils and monocytes within the mesangium. A diagnosis of ICGN can be made by immunofluorescent or immunohistochemical demonstration of immunoglobulin and complement components, usually C3, in glomerular tufts. To augment light microscopic findings, transmission electron microscopy can be done to demonstrate typical subepithelial and intramembrane electron-dense deposits, fusion of podocyte foot processes, and intramesangial hypercellularity. In dogs, IgG or IgM are the most common immunoglobulin isotypes demonstrated in ICGN; however, combinations of IgG, IgM, and IgA also occur in the glomeruli of some dogs. In one study, IgA was the only immunoglobulin found in three dogs with ICGN. Both Ig and C3 are usually demonstrated in a granular (\"lumpy-bumpy\") pattern using immunofluorescent or immunohistochemical techniques (Fig. 11-28 ; E- Fig. 11-4) ; however, in anti-GBM disease, as reported in human beings, horses, and a single dog, the antibody deposits have a linear distribution conforming to the basement membranes. It is important to remember that After immune-complex deposition, glomerular injury can also occur from the aggregation of platelets and activation of Hageman factor, which results in the formation of fibrin thrombi that produce glomerular ischemia. Furthermore, glomerular epithelial cell and ECM damage can result directly from the terminal membrane attack complex of the activated complement cascade (C5 to C9). This can result in epithelial detachment (causing proteinuria) and GBM thickening subsequent to upregulation of epithelial cell receptors for transforming growth factor (Fig. 11-27, B) . Cell-mediated cytotoxic responses (from sensitized T lymphocytes) to glomerular antigens or complexes may exacerbate renal lesions. Complexes themselves may modulate the immune response through interaction with receptors on various cells.",

Membrane thickening occurs because of the presence of subepithelial immunoglobulin deposits, as the predominant change ( Fig. 11-31 ; also see Fig. 11-30, B) . These deposits are separated by protrusions of GBM matrix that eventually encompass these deposits. After removal of the deposited material, cavities are left in the GBM and later these fill with GBM-like material, which results in sclerotic change within the glomerular tuft.

This process is accomplished by eluting antibodies from diseased glomeruli and attempting to identify their specificity for suspected antigens. For example, antibodies eluted from the glomeruli of dogs with GN associated with severe heartworm disease bind to several Dirofilaria immitis antigens, including the body wall of adult worms, parasitic uterine fluid, and microfilaria.

Kidneys are often slightly swollen, have a smooth capsular surface, are of normal color or slightly pale, and have glomeruli that are visible as pinpoint red dots on the cut surface of the cortex (Fig. 11-29) . The normal glomeruli of horses are usually visible, so this feature of pinpoint red dots for glomeruli cannot be used for diagnosis in that species. If lesions do not resolve but become subacute to chronic, the renal cortex becomes somewhat shrunken and the capsular surface has a generalized fine granularity. On cut surface, the cortex can be thinned and its surface granular, and glomeruli can appear as pinpoint pale gray dots. With time, more severe scarring can develop throughout the cortex (see the section on Renal Fibrosis). the most common morphologic form of ICGN in the dog. With light microscopy, membranoproliferative GN changes are similar across cases; however, differences can be seen with immunofluorescent and electron microscopy. The latter technique has resulted in subcategorization of human being membranoproliferative GN into types I and II (see Fig. 11-31) . Type I lesions, which are typical of those found in domestic animals, are characterized by the presence of subendothelial deposits and a granular pattern after deposition of C3 and lesser quantities of IgG, C1q, and C4. Type I disease appears to be secondary to deposition of circulating immune complexes. Type II is far less common in human beings than type I and is also referred to as dense deposit disease because electron-dense material of unknown include adhesions between the epithelial cells of the glomerular tuft and Bowman's capsule (synechiae; singular = synechia); hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the parietal epithelium lining Bowman's capsule; deposition of fibrinogen and fibrinous thrombi in glomerular capillaries, secondary to or as a result of the glomerular damage; and dilated renal tubules filled with homogeneous proteinaceous fluid. An increase in mesangial matrix is often also present. If the damage is mild and the cause is removed, glomeruli can heal without obvious or with minimal residual lesions. However, if the lesion is severe and prolonged, subacute to chronic glomerular changes develop. Bowman's capsule can become thickened, hyalinized, and reduplicated. In severe cases, proliferation of parietal epithelium, an influx of monocytes, and deposition of fibrin can occur within Bowman's capsule, resulting in the formation of a semicircular, hypercellular, intraglomerular lesion known as a glomerular crescent. The glomerular crescent can also undergo fibrosis, and if Bowman's capsule ruptures, glomerular fibrosis can become continuous with interstitial fibrosis. Interstitial and periglomerular fibrosis, foci of interstitial lymphocytes, and plasma cells and glomerulosclerosis may be present in chronic GN. Minimal Change Disease. In human beings, a common proteinlosing glomerulopathy, especially in children, is one in which glomerular histologic changes are minimal or absent, hence the name minimal change disease (MCD). The lesion is characterized ultrastructurally by diffuse effacement of visceral epithelial cell (podocyte) foot processes with minimal or no basement membrane composition and smaller quantities of C3 form an irregular deposit within the subendothelial space and the lamina densa. Type II disease may be a form of autoimmune disease, but its pathogenesis is not clear.",

Amyloid is relatively acellular and can accumulate segmentally within glomerular tufts; thus a portion of the normal glomerular architecture is replaced by eosinophilic, homogeneous to slightly fibrillar material ( Fig.  11-34, A) . When amyloidosis involves the entire glomerular tuft, the glomerulus is enlarged, capillary lumina become obliterated, and the tuft can appear as a large hypocellular eosinophilic hyaline sphere ( Fig. 11-34, B) . Amyloid can be present in renal tubular basement membranes, and these membranes appear hyalinized and thickened. In addition, in cases of glomerular amyloid deposition, secondary changes may be present in renal tubules, which are usually markedly dilated, have variably atrophic epithelium, and appearing as a nodular or segmental hyalinized thickening in affected glomeruli. Because tubules receive their blood supply from the vasa recta, derived from the glomerular efferent arteriole, glomerulosclerosis reduces the blood flow through the vasa recta, thus decreasing oxygen tension in the tubules. The ensuing hypoxia is responsible for tubular epithelial cell death via apoptosis resulting in failure to regenerate to columnar cells. Affected tubules often have reduced diameters and are lined by cuboidal or squamous cells, which lack a brush border and the functions of the normal columnar cells.

Mild multifocal glomerulosclerosis of unknown cause is often an incidental finding in aged animals. Glomerulosclerosis has been reported occasionally in animals with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In these cases, global or nodular eosinophilic glycoprotein material (hyaline material) is deposited in the glomerular mesangium. Glomerular Amyloidosis. Amyloid, an insoluble fibrillar protein with a \u03b2-pleated sheet conformation, is produced after incomplete proteolysis of several soluble amyloidogenic proteins. Amyloid deposits in patients with plasma cell myelomas or other B lymphocyte dyscrasias (called AL amyloidosis) are composed of fragments of the light (\u03bb) chains of immunoglobulins. In domestic animals, spontaneously occurring amyloidosis is usually an example of what is called reactive amyloidosis (AA amyloidosis). This form of the disease is often associated with chronic inflammatory diseases; the amyloid deposits are composed of fragments of a serum acute-phase reactant protein called serum amyloid-A (SAA) protein. Amyloid fibrils from either source are deposited in tissue along with a glycoprotein called amyloid P component.",

Renal amyloidosis commonly occurs in association with other diseases, particularly chronic inflammatory or neoplastic diseases. However, idiopathic renal amyloidosis (i.e., amyloidosis in which an associated disease process is not recognized) is also described in dogs and cats. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of idiopathic renal amyloidosis are not known. In one study, 23% of dogs that presented with proteinuria had renal amyloidosis. A hereditary predisposition for the development of reactive amyloidosis (AA) has been found in Abyssinian cats and Chinese Shar-Pei dogs. A familial tendency is suspected in Siamese cats, English foxhounds, and beagle dogs. In Figure 11 -32 Amyloidosis, Kidney, Dog. Grossly, kidneys affected by amyloid deposition are diffusely tan, waxy (firm), and of normal size or slightly enlarged. Affected glomeruli are not grossly visible in this specimen, unlike in advanced cases of glomerular amyloidosis or chronic GN. In advanced cases of amyloidosis, glomeruli may be visible as pinpoint, glistening, round, cortical foci. In cats and Shar-Pei dogs, amyloid is deposited in the medullary interstitium, not in the glomeruli. There are also multiple foci of medullary crest necrosis (yellowish-green [arrows]).

The underlying tubular defect appears to be abnormal membrane structure of the proximal tubular epithelial cell brush borders because of altered lipid content in the cell membrane. Gross lesions are not identifiable in the early stages. Histopathologic changes in the kidneys are initially minimal, consisting of irregularly sized tubular epithelial cells in the convoluted tubules and loops of Henle.

Corynebacterium renale, Trueperella pyogenes, and Actinobaculum (Eubacterium) suis are specifically pathogenic for the lower urinary tract of cattle and pigs, respectively, and are common causes of pyelonephritis. Granulomatous and necrotizing pyelonephritis associated with Aspergillus sp. or Paecilomyces sp. can occur in rare instances. ",

Papillary necrosis can be a primary or secondary lesion. When papillary necrosis occurs as a primary lesion, it can, in some cases, be severe enough to cause clinical disease. This scenario usually occurs in animals treated with NSAIDs, which can result in a clinical disease analogous to analgesic nephropathy in human beings. Primary papillary necrosis occurs quite frequently in horses treated for prolonged periods with phenylbutazone or flunixin meglumine. Additionally in horses, simultaneous treatment with two NSAIDs increases the risk of clinical disease. It is important in dogs and cats because of accidental ingestion of or treatment with ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen at excessive dosages. Drugs associated with papillary necrosis have been referred to as papillotoxins. Medullary interstitial cells are the primary targets of papillotoxins. These cells synthesize prostaglandins, antihypertensive factors, and the glycosaminoglycan matrix of the medullary interstitium. Interstitial cell damage decreases prostaglandin synthesis, which reduces normal blood flow and causes ischemia, increases tubular transport, and modifies the interstitial matrix; the net effect is degenerative changes in tubular epithelial cells in the inner medulla. In addition to its inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis, acetaminophen also causes direct oxidative damage to medullary tubular epithelium after covalent binding to the cells, further enhancing necrosis of the renal papillae.",

Most of the medullary blood supply comes from the cortex after passing through the glomeruli and entering the vasa recta. Because of limited blood flow and high metabolic medullary cellular demand, any lesion or disease process that further reduces medullary blood flow can cause ischemic necrosis (infarction) of the papillae. In addition, the high metabolic demand for cell transport and the maintenance of an ion gradient to enhance urinary concentration makes this area particularly vulnerable. This is most evident after ischemic tubular damage where swollen endothelial and tubular epithelial cells, in conjunction with neutrophil adhesion in small vessels, upset the balance of oxygenation and energy demand by the medullary tubular cells. Medullary blood flow is ultimately balanced through concentrations of vasodilators, such as prostaglandin, nitric oxide, and adenosine, and vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin and angiotensin II.",

Nephroblastomas (embryonal nephroma or Wilms tumor) are the most common renal neoplasms of pigs and chickens, in which they are usually recognized as incidental findings at slaughter. They occur in cattle and dogs as well, but less frequently. These neoplasms arise from metanephric blastema and thus occur in young animals, less than 2 years old. It is speculated that neoplasms result from malignant transformation during normal nephrogenesis or from neoplastic transformation of nests of embryonic tissue that persists in the postnatal kidneys. At autopsy (syn: necropsy), nephroblastomas can be solitary or multiple masses that often reach a great size and in which recognizable renal tissue can be difficult to detect. They usually are soft to rubbery and gray with foci of hemorrhage. On a cut surface, they are often lobulated. Because nephroblastomas arise from primitive pluripotential tissue, histologic features vary but are morphologically similar to the developmental stages of embryonic kidneys. Characteristically, three components-including primitive, loose myxomatous mesenchymal tissue interspersed with primitive tubules lined by elongated, deeply staining cells and structures that resemble primitive glomeruli-are present. Nests of cells resembling the metanephric blastema can be present. Nephroblastomas also have mesenchymal components such as cartilage, bone, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Clinically, these tumors can be incidental findings; however, of a notably small-diameter ureter. Agenesis of the ureters is the result of failure of the ureteral bud to form and may be unilateral or bilateral. Both conditions are rare. If these defects occur alone, disruption of urinary flow from the kidney to the urinary bladder results in obstructive diseases such as hydronephrosis. If these defects occur with concurrent renal aplasia, they are clinically silent if aplasia is unilateral, and incompatible with life if aplasia is bilateral.",

As a result, affected animals dribble urine from the umbilicus. The patent urachus is susceptible to infection and abscess formation. Conversely, umbilical inflammation and abscess formation may lead to failure of the urachal remnant and the umbilical arteries and vein to involute, potentially causing a patent urachus. Rupture of the urachus causes uroperitoneum, which must be differentiated from perinatal rupture of the bladder. Occasionally, during urachal closure, the mucosa closes but closure of the bladder musculature is incomplete. When this occurs, a bladder diverticulum (outpouching) at the apex of the bladder can develop. Diverticula of the bladder may also be acquired secondary to partial obstruction of urine outflow and result from pressure changes exerted during normal contractions of the bladder.

In male cattle, calculi lodge in the urethra at the ischial arch and at the proximal end of the sigmoid flexure; in rams and wethers, the urethral process (vermiform appendage) is the most common site (Fig.  11-55, A) ; and in dogs, calculi lodge proximal to the base of the os penis ( Fig. 11-55, B) . At the site in which calculi lodge, there is local pressure necrosis, ulceration of the mucosa, and acute eliminated by the flushing action of normal urine flow. Predisposition to urinary tract infection (UTI) occurs when there is stagnation of urine because of urinary tract obstruction, incomplete voiding during urination, or urothelial trauma. Other risk factors for UTI include urinary catheterization, vaginoscopy, vaginitis, urinary incontinence, or recent administration of medications such as antibiotics or corticosteroids. Bacterial cystitis is more common in females because their relatively short urethra provides less of a barrier to ascending infections than the longer, narrower male urethra. In all domestic animal species, the bacterial agent that most commonly causes cystitis is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (\u03b1-hemolysin-producing strains). Other bacterial pathogens that are important causes of cystis include Corynebacterium renale in cattle, Actinobaculum suis (Eubacterium suis) in pigs, Enterococcus faecalis in cats, and Klebsiella sp. in horses. In addition, Proteus sp., Streptococcus sp., and Staphylococcus sp. have been isolated from cases of cystitis in several animal species. Except for the distal urethra, the lower urinary tract is normally free of bacteria. Sterility of the urinary bladder is maintained by normal intermittent voiding of urine and because of the antibacterial properties of urine. These antibacterial properties are attributed to the following: \u2022 The acidic urine of carnivores \u2022 Secretory IgA \u2022 Secreted mucin that inhibits bacterial adhesion \u2022 The high concentration of urea and organic acids \u2022 High urine osmolality Cystitis occurs when bacteria are able to overcome normal defense mechanisms and adhere to or invade (colonize) the urinary bladder mucosa. Several factors can enhance colonization and predispose animals to cystitis. Bacterial virulence factors, such as the expression of surface molecules that enhance adhesion (e.g., the P and type 1 fimbriae of certain strains of Escherichia coli and Actinobaculum suis and the pH-dependent adherence by pili of Corynebacterium renale) increase the likelihood of bacterial colonization. Other bacterial virulence factors, such as the Escherichia coli hemolysin, enhance pathogenicity and help bacteria overcome antibacterial factors of the urinary bladder and urine.",

Urine in such cases is described as cloudy, flocculent, foul smelling, and red-tinged. The mucosa can have foci of erosion or ulceration, patches or sheets of adherent exudate and necrotic debris, or adherent blood clots ( Fig. 11-57, A) . Corynebacterium urealyticum in dogs and cats and Corynebacterium matruchotii in a horse were implicated in a condition known as encrusted cystitis, in which plaques and accumulation of sediment predominate. Rarely, surgical debridement in addition to appropriate antimicrobial therapy is required.",

Microscopically, the neoplastic cells form disorganized sheets or lobules in poorly differentiated regions and interlacing streams of fusiform cells in more well-differentiated areas. Microscopic demonstration of cross-striations typical of skeletal muscle or immunohistochemical demonstration of the intermediate filament, desmin, are useful to confirm the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma.

In rhabdomyolysis, serum concentrations of myoglobin are increased, as these products pass into the glomerular filtrate, producing greatly increased intraluminal concentrations that cause myoglobinuric nephrosis. Myoglobin does not use a carrier protein for transportation, and because it is a small molecule, it freely passes through the glomerulus and is excreted in the urine. Myoglobin is not nephrotoxic in itself, and intravenous infusions into healthy animals produce no recognizable lesions. However, large concentrations of myoglobin in the glomerular filtrate can increase the tubular necrosis caused by renal ischemia. The mechanism of pigment-induced renal injury is not fully understood, but increased hydroxyl radical formation associated with reduction of ferrous iron compounds and tubular obstruction by myoglobin casts are likely contributing factors. For example, in equine rhabdomyolysis, renal ischemia is most likely secondary to hypovolemic shock or severe accompanying anemia. Myoglobinuria can have an additive deleterious effect on tubular epithelium already undergoing ischemic necrosis.

In cattle, white-spotted kidneys are seen in calves and are often incidental findings at slaughter or necropsy arising from other systemic causes. Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Leptospira spp., and Brucella spp. have all been implicated. Usually, by the time the lesion is found, bacteria cannot be cultured from the kidneys. Molecular studies of potential causative microbes of white-spotted kidneys in calves have demonstrated differing findings indicating that the lesion can result from one of several microbes. Lesions can be small to larger, patchy, coalescing areas of pale cortex readily visible from the capsular surface ( Fig. 11-63) . Histologically, acute lesions, which are rarely seen in cattle, are consistent with neutrophilic embolic nephritis or tubulointerstitial inflammation.

Silica calculi are hard, white to dark-brown, radiopaque, often laminated, up to 1-cm-diameter stones and are a major cause of urinary tract obstruction.

GN and systemic vasculitis can be observed in porcine circovirus 2 infection manifested as porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome. In acute GN, grossly, there is enlargement, pallor, edema, and cortical petechiation of the kidney. Eventually, this process progresses to granular cortical infiltrates and the kidney may appear shrunken and contracted due to cortical fibrosis. Kidney lesions in the acute form of Hairy Vetch Toxicosis (Vicia Spp.) Hairy vetch is a legume used throughout regions with extensive farming and can be fed as pasture, hay, or silage. Hairy vetch toxicosis is uncommon and is a unique manifestation of toxic plant ingestion that can result in lesions of eosinophilic and granulomatous inflammation within the kidney, skin, and other viscera. The toxic mechanism is not clearly determined for the visceral disease. It has been postulated that the visceral inflammation is similar to a type IV hypersensitivity reaction and may be caused by plant lectins that serve as haptens (see Chapter 5) or as a complete antigen that sensitizes lymphocytes. Although gross lesions at autopsy (syn: necropsy) can involve multiple organs, the kidney contains multifocal to radiating cortical infiltrates (see Fig. 11-49, A) . These are often oriented around the vasculature. Histologically, infiltrates are mixed and include monocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, multinucleated giant cells, and eosinophils (see Fig. 11-49, B) . Clinical disease develops several weeks after ingestion of the plant, and dermal manifestation of pruritus is consistently seen concurrently. Mortality can result 10 to 20 days after illness begins, and older Holstein or Angus cattle breeds are the most susceptible. Diagnosis is often made by exclusion.",

Sick animals had inappetence, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, and lethargy. Azotemia was recorded in many affected animals. The unique aspects of this food toxicity outbreak included necrosis that was localized to the distal rather than the proximal tubules. Unique intratubular rough and irregular brown birefringent crystals were noted in the more distal tubular portions of the nephron, and these may have been mistaken for oxalates in some early cases. In contrast, these crystals failed to stain with von Kossa calcium stains or alizarin Red S.

High urine concentrations of cystine are due to defective proximal tubular reabsorption from glomerular filtrate, and many affected dogs also have high concentrations of other amino acids in their urine. The other amino acids in the urine are more soluble than cystine, which precipitates in acidic urine, although the formation of cystine stones is also influenced by factors other than urine pH.

            "text": "\"feline interstitial cystitis\" because of some commonalities to the condition of a similar name in human beings. In cats, FIC is believed to be the result of complex interactions between the urinary bladder, nervous system, adrenal glands, and environmental factors. Typical clinical signs include dysuria, stranguria, and hematuria. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, made by ruling out the presence of urolithiasis, urethral plugs, trauma or strictures, bacterial cystitis, or urinary tract neoplasia. FIC, as a component of FLUTD, is more common in middle-aged, overweight male cats with indoor housing. Histologic lesions of FIC are nonspecific, but they include submucosal edema, dilation of blood vessels with neutrophil margination, and submucosal hemorrhage. Erosion, ulceration, or thinning of urothelial epithelium is common in chronic cases of FIC. Several other alterations that may reflect the pathogenesis are usually noted in the urinary bladders of affected cats. These changes include an increase in the number of submucosal mast cells, a decrease in the concentration of urothelial glycosaminoglycans, an increase in urothelial permeability, and neurogenic inflammation. It is possible that mast-cell degranulation contributes to inflammation. Decreased glycosaminoglycans may allow urine to penetrate the urothelial barrier and induce submucosal inflammation. Disruption of the tight junctions between urothelial cells results in increased permeability. Neurogenic inflammation may occur after local release of neurotransmitters that results in vasodilation and leakage. Thus potential abnormalities in local, sensory, central, and efferent nervous",

There are multifocal, coalescing white to gray granulomas (arrow), which can be confused with the nodular form of lymphoma (lymphosarcoma), thus warranting histologic examination. B, Dorsal section. Multifocal, coalescing white to gray granulomas extend into the cortical parenchyma (arrow). The pathogenesis of this lesion is determined by the effectiveness and/or ineffectiveness of both humoral and cellular immune responses. Depending on the immune response, the pathogenesis can involve a primary immune complex vasculitis (type III hypersensitivity [effusive form]) and/or delayed hypersensitivity response (type IV hypersensitivity [noneffusive form]); thus the lesions are oriented around blood vessels (primarily capillaries and venules) and are granulomatous.

Actin Cytoskeleton and the Cytoskeletal-Surface Membrane Interactions in Proximal Tubule Cells. Microvillar F-actin filaments extend into the apical actin network termed the terminal web (TW) and are bound together by villin and attached to the surface membrane by myosin and ezrin to form the structural core of the apical microvilli. The actin cytoskeleton associates with junctional complexes involved in cell-cell interactions, including the tight junction and the adherens junction. More detailed diagrams of the tight junction (TJ) and the adherens junction (AJ)appear to the right and demonstrate the interaction of F-actin filaments with TJ and AJ protein complexes.
