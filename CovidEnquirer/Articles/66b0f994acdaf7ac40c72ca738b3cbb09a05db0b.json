Both of these infection sites had pathology entirely due to bacterial or fungal pathogens in the most recent NNIS report. Viruses were confined to causing 30% of episodes of hospital-acquired gastrointestinal infections and 5.1% of eye, ear, nose, and throat infections. 3 Congenital infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV), which rarely pose infection control problems, are the more conventional scenarios in which viruses are discussed in neonatal units. Why, then, include a section on hospital-acquired viral pathogens in this volume? Viruses can cause considerable pathology, often present atypically in NICU patients, may be difficult to detect (many require specific antibody studies or viral isolation techniques, and thus need to specifically considered to be diagnosed), and can spread rapidly within NICUs. Control of outbreaks caused by viral pathogens often involves prolonged and strict adherence to isolation precautions and may not be achieved until after many patients and/or staff are affected. Unlike some bacterial pathogens, hospital-acquired viral infections may affect immune-competent children without traditional risk factors for hospital-acquired infections (eg, indwelling catheters or ventilators) and may be of increased relevance in well-baby nurseries or lower-acuity NICUs as well. An understanding of the range of viral pathogens that may be involved in hospital-acquired infections, their modes of spread, and potential methods of control are important to limit the scope of an outbreak.",

Although there is a well-described seasonal variation in RV in the general population, 15 rates of disease in nurseries may not correspond to community trends. 6 Ill healthcare workers are often the initial source of RV infection, but this reservoir is not always clearly implicated. Some have raised the possibility that the relatively constant temperature and humidity within the NICU blunt these seasonal trends. Some nurseries show fluctuating rates of RV with increases in the colder months and fewer infants shedding the virus in the warmer months, and other studies show constant rates of shedding. 4 There may also be variation among units in the rate of symptomatic infections compared to asymptomatic carriage. 4 RV may be introduced into the NICU by several routes. Reports of high levels of viral excretion during the first two days of life provide some evidence for vertical transmission of RV. 6,16 Any of the wide variety of non-newborns (physicians, nurses, hospital staff, family members) who come in contact with infants in the NICU may contribute to RV spread. Infant-toinfant transfer of RV via the hands of personnel or direct contact with people (especially ill healthcare workers) excreting the virus are possible mechanisms. 17 Although airborne infection, as fomites, 19 and contaminated formula are potential mechanisms of spread, there are no reports of NICU transmission through these means.",

In one study of RV in neonates, an infant with convulsions was transferred to a premature ward that had been RV free. 2~ This child was later found to be infected with RV. Subsequently, 63% of the infants in that ward and 46% of infants in the nursery were found to be RV positive. Some infections occurred as early as 24 hours after the index case was diagnosed. The average time to diagnosis was 5 days after admission to the hospital or detection of the index case. Of note, all cases of RV in this outbreak were identical by molecular typing, indicating nosocomial spread. One week after the index case was admitted, infection control procedures were instituted. Although this decreased the number of new cases, it took weeks for the outbreak to subside. 21 Because asymptomatic and prolonged shedding of RV is common, vigilance regarding hand washing and standard precautions are necessary to prevent, outbreaks. These infection control practices must be in place routinely and adhered to continually, and not just when a case has been identified. Regular disinfection of surfaces and of potential fomites (eg, stethoscopes) may help in preventing spread as RV may remain viable on inanimate surfaces for prolonged periods. 22 Alcohol-based disinfectants and hand cleansers are important resources in the interruption of RV transmission.

An outbreak of echovirus 33 (EV33) infection occurred in a newborn unit and involved 9 patients during an ll-day period. 35 Of these, 5 patients devel-oped meningitis, 3 developed coagulopathy, and 1 died. The level of maternal antibody to EV33 appeared to be a predictor of severity of illness. Similar outbreaks with multiple infants developing systemic symptoms within days of the index case have been described with other echoviruses. 33,34 However, in other cases, the outbreak occurred weeks after admission of the index patient, while the patient was still excreting virus.31, 32 Although some enteroviruses can be passed transplacentally, the more common means of maternal-infant transmission appears to be after birth via fecal-oral or respiratory spread. Spread among patients likely occurs more efficiently via the fecal-oral route than via the respiratory route, and prolonged shedding in the stool of patients and healthcare workers may facilitate the continuation of an outbreak as described above for RV. 39 While there is no widely accepted treatment for enteroviral disease, several authors have described the use of immunoglobulin (MG) in outbreak settings and in life-threatening infections. Abzug et al40 showed more rapid resolution of viremia and viruria in patients who received MG with high titers of neutralizing antibodies against the specific type of enterovirus with which they were infected. Pasic et al. described the use of prophylactic MG during a NICU outbreak of echovirus. 41 This decreased the risk of symptomatic viral infection from 19% in the untreated group to 5% in the group receiving IVIG. However, larger studies would be required before immunoglobulin could be routinely recommended for this use.

This study included NICU patients, although the program was used in other pediatric populations as well.

Factors that play a role in transmission include the difficulty of eliminating viral particles from environmental surfaces, long incubation period, and the ability to transmit virus through aerosols and direct and indirect contact. Infection in the neonate may have high morbidity and be confused with bacterial sepsis. Other manifestations can include URI symptoms, lower respiratory tract symptoms, conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis (caused by specific serotypes, generally 40 and 41), and fever. In neonates, disseminated disease including pneumonia, meningitis, or encephalitis may also occur. 2 Although long incubation periods may make outbreaks difficult to detect, early recognition of adenoviral infection may allow for limitation of viral spread. Coinfection of patients with adenovirus and other viral pathogens has contributed to delayed diagnosis (due to attribution of symptoms to another virus) with subsequent spread to staff members and other patients. 7~ Another report of adenovirus spread within a NICU described a lower attack rate and less disseminated disease. 71 Significantly, healthcare workers were affected in that outbreak as well as in one of adenoviral conjunctivitis related to contaminated ophthalmology equipment. 69 Control measures for adenovirus disease include contact and droplet precautions, strict enforcement of hand washing, proper disinfection of ophthalmologic and other medical equipment, cohorting of patients in outbreak situations, and exclusion of affected staff and parents from the unit. Protective eyewear for healthcare workers may be of use when caring for patients with adenoviral conjunctivitis to provide an additional barrier to patient-to-caregiver spread. Severe outbreaks may result in unit closure. 7~",

Nonetheless, there are several reports of varicella outbreaks in NICUs. s~ Premature infants may be at increased risk because of decreased levels of antibody, although antibody may still be detectable in many of these infants. 82,8B The cornerstone of infection control management is to place infants who have had exposure on airborne isolation and provide passive immunization to high-risk infants with varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG). Candidates for VZIG, according to the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics, 28 are all hospitalized premature infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation or 1000 g, those 28 weeks or greater if the mother has no reliable history or serologic evidence ofvaricella immunity, and those whose mother developed varicella between 5 days prior to and 48 hours after delivery. However, several reports show negative VZV antibody status and/or cases of varicella in infants of 28 to 32 weeks' gestation despite a positive maternal history of VZV. 80,s1,s4 Therefore, testing or empiric treatment in that subgroup may be justified. All NICU healthcare workers should be vaccinated against varicella or show evidence of immunity. Of note, some commercially available serologic tests have low sensitivity and specificity for VZV antibodies in immunized adults. 85 In an outbreak setting, postexposure vaccine may be of benefit in exposed people over 1 year of age (eg, healthcare workers, family members). 28 With the increasing use of varicella vaccine in the community and a demonstrated decrease in disease, 86 it is likely that NICU exposures will be even less common in the near future.",
