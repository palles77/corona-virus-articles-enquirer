China suffers severely from tick-borne viral diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), but the background of tick-borne viruses is very limited. Here we report the virome profiling of ticks and goat sera from SFTS-epidemic areas, and serological investigation of SFTS virus (SFTSV) and Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV). Results revealed divergent viruses in ticks and goat sera, including SFTSV and NSDV. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the SFTSV identified here was most closely related to human SFTSV in sampling and surrounding areas, and the NSDV to the previously identified NSDV from northeast China. Serological investigation of SFTSV infection in goats revealed intensive activity in those areas. Surprisingly, two different methods of NSDV serological investigation showed no sera positive for this virus.",

They are recognized, along with mosquitoes, as the main arthropod vectors of disease agents with hosts ranging from wildlife to humans and domestic animals globally (Dantas-Torres et al., 2012) . Due to their propensity for feeding on a wide range of hosts, ticks readily transmit pathogens between different host species, thereby providing huge obstacles to the control and prevention of tick-borne diseases (TBD) . Diverse microorganisms such as rickettsia, anaplasma, and ehrlichia are among the important pathogens transmitted by ticks, and tick-borne viruses (TBV) are increasingly being considered a major threat to humans and other animals (Dantas-Torres et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging hemorrhagic fever first diagnosed in Xinyang, Henan province, China in 2009 (Yu et al., 2011) . Currently, almost 10,000 cases of the disease have been reported in 23 provinces and etiologically confirmed in 18 provinces, with numbers increasing yearly ( Fig. 1) (Liu et al., 2014b; Zhan et al., 2017) . Due to a lack of any prophylactic vaccine or effective antivirals, the mortality rate of SFTS cases can reach as high as 30%. SFTS has therefore become a significant public health problem (Liu et al., 2014b; Zhan et al., 2017) . Beyond China, SFTS has also been reported in Japan and South Korea in 2013, with a similar case reported in the USA in 2012 (Kim et al., 2013; McMullan et al., 2012; Takahashi et al., 2014) , indicative of a potentially global situation requiring control and prevention. The causative agent of SFTS is a recently described new phlebovirus (SFTSV) within the family Phenuiviridae, order Bunyavirales. The tick Haemaphysalis longicornis (H. longgicornis) is considered the most likely transmission vector , but the natural animal hosts of SFTSV remain uncertain, even though many domestic animals in endemic areas, such as goats, cattle, dogs, pigs and chickens, and even rodents, have been found to exhibit a high seroprevalence of this virus without presenting any notable symptoms. It especially in exotic and crossbred animals, and has been responsible for several outbreaks of disease in East Africa (Baron and Holzer, 2015) . The virus has also been identified in South Asia (India and Sri Lanka), where it is known as Ganjam virus (Marczinke and Nichol, 2002; Perera et al., 1996) . NSDV infection of humans can cause a mild disease with symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, and therefore classifies as a zoonotic pathogen (Dandawate et al., 1969b) . Extensive serological studies carried out in different parts of India have showed a (Zhan et al., 2017) ].",

Follow-up RT-PCR screening showed that 1 and 2 pools of ticks out of 103 and 169 from HD (0.97%) and XL (1.18%) respectively were SFTSV positive, with only 2 pools from HD NSDV positive (1.94%, 2/103) ( Table 1) . Three SFTSV and two NSDV amplicons, all from Suizhou ticks, showed 100% identities within the viruses (Fig. 1B) . However, all goat sera were negative for both viruses in RT-PCR screening. Positive tick samples of NSDV were tested for the presence of virus in BHK-21 and Vero cell lines and in suckling mice by intracerebral (i.c.) injection. Five blind passages in the cells revealed no cytopathogenic effects (CPE) and none of the injected animals showed any symptoms. RT-PCR analyses of all passaged cultures as well as tissues of the injected animals were negative: i.e., no evidence of NSDV infection was obtained. Using degenerate primer pairs, the complete genome of an SFTSV isolate (named SZHL9) and the almost complete genome of an NSDV isolate (named SZHL16) were successfully obtained. The S, M and L segments of SFTSV SZHL9 had exactly the same lengths (1744, 3378 and 6368 nt, respectively) as those of previously identified viruses in China. The 3 nearly complete genomic segments of NSDV SZHL16 were 1602 (S), The full genomic sequences obtained above were aligned with all representative SFTSV and NSDV sequences retrieved from Genbank and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. The best-fit substitution models, under AIC1, for the S, M, and L segments of both viruses were selected as K80 + I (I= 0.86), TVM+I (I= 0.89), TVM+I (I= 0.88), GTR+I +G (I= 0.22, a= 0.91), GTR+I+G (I= 0.15, a= 1.14), and GTR + I + G (I= 0.30, a= 1.13). Phylogenetic trees are shown in Fig. 5 . In the SFTSV tree, S, M and L segments of SZHL9 were closely similar to those of other SFTSVs with the S segment sharing the highest identity (99.4%) with SFTSV HNXY_27 (Liu et al., 2013b) , and the M and L segments (99.4% and 99.2%) with SFTSV 2012YSH37 and 2012YSH14 respectively ( Fig. 5A -C) (Huang et al., 2014) . In three gene segment NSDV trees, NSDV SZHL16 clustered most closely with NSDV Jilin/China (93.2%, 94.9% and 95.4% for the S, M and L segments respectively) ( Fig. 5D -F). Interestingly, in the S gene phylogeny, Chinese NSDVs shared nearly the same identity (~88.0%) with viruses from both Africa and India, but in M and L phylogenies Chinese NSDVs grouped more closely with African viruses (88.1% identity in M and 89.0% in L) than with Indian viruses (72.0-76% identity in M and 88.9% in L) ( Fig. 5D -F).",

By sampling site, the highest seroprevalence was in samples from Xiaolin (75.8%, 160/211) followed by Yindian (74.9%, 173/231), with Yangdan and Wangcheng goats showing the lowest (13.5%, 5/ 37% and 19.4%, 13/67 respectively). Of note is that Xiaolin is the site from which the collected ticks were SFTSV-positive, while another tick SFTSV-positive site, Haodian, showed 59.2% (29/49) seroprevalence in goats. IIFA results summarized in Table 1 show that goat SFTSV seroprevalence in Suizhou was much higher than in Xiangyang (Fig. 6A ). IIFA tested using 2-fold dilutions showed that 35.3% (46.8% of Suizhou, 14.4% of Xiangyang) had titers of 1:400, 19.7% of 1:1600 (26.5% in Suizhou, 7.1% in Xiangyang), and 2.8% of 1:6400 (3.7% in Suizhou, 1.1% in Xiangyang) (Fig. 6B ). One serum from Liushen in Xiangyang even had a titer of 1:25,600 (Table 1) . Fifty one sera (49 positive and 2 negative) were further tested for neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels against SFTSV WF66 by neutralization assay (NA) with results showing that 49.0% (24/49) of the IIFA-positive sera had NAb titers of between 5 and 30, whereas the 2 IIFA negative sera were also negative by NA (Fig. 6C) .

An IIFA method using truncated NP-recombinant baculovirus was established to confirm the ELISA results. Again, all sera tested seronegative (Fig. 7B) . As a further check, 14 sera including 8 with the highest OD 492 values (marked with an asterisk in Fig. 7A ) were analyzed by Western blot (WB) using two types of NPs, expressed by E. coli and a recombinant baculovirus, as antigens. Results showed no significant reaction of goat sera with the NPs.",

Investigation into pathogens harbored by domestic animals does not therefore benefit only animal health but is also crucial to maintain human public health. Goats, as a major meat source, are widely farmed in China, but the pathogens they harbor have been poorly investigated compared to those of pigs and chickens. Here, our pioneer virome profiling of goat sera has revealed a variety of viruses that have not been previously reported in goats, including parvovirus, picobirnavirus, cardiovirus, hepacivirus and papillomavirus. Many viruses identified here in goats, such as astrovirus, cardiovirus, papillomavirus and circovirus, showed significant genetic divergences and are therefore likely newly discovered and suggestive of an independent evolution of these viruses in goats. In contrast, some other viruses, such as hepacivirus and bocaparvovirus, had up to 89% nt identities with corresponding viruses of other animal species, indicating a broad host tropism. Results here also indicated multiple infections of variants of mamastrovirus, bocaparvovirus and dependoparvovirus, because several alleles of genes of those viruses showed distinct divergences, but contigs of cardiovirus and mononegavirus could be from different viruses or from the same virus (recombinational or not), since their dispersed contigs showed different but close identities with references. Only astroviruses have been identified to be associated with a disease, encephalitis and ganglionitis in sheep (Toffan et al., 2009) , and the pathogenicity of the other viruses remains unknown. Of note is the identification here of hepaciviruses, a species that includes hepatitis C virus causing hepatocellular carcinoma and lymphomas in humans (Hajarizadeh et al., 2013) . Hepaciviruses have recently been identified in other mammals, including dogs, horses, rodents and bats, indicating its complicated evolutionary history (Scheel et al., 2015) . The hepacivirus contig obtained here showed close relationship with rodent hepaciviruses and clustered together with these ( Fig. 3B ), indicating either a common ancestor between rodent and goat or possible interspecies transmission. Although major pathogenic viruses were not detected in serum samples of the healthy-looking goat flocks tested in the present study, virome profiling has revealed that goat sera can harbor a variety of viruses without to investigate the symbiosis of viruses with their hosts. These viral reads revealed by VIRES most likely originate from viruses that infect or are harbored by goats, such as astrovirus, hepacivirus and parvovirus, but the possibility cannot be ruled out that some of these sequences, especially retrovirus-like contigs, derive from endogenized viral sequences (EVEs) since contigs containing intact ORF have not been obtained, even though host genomes and free nucleic acids were largely removed by digestion of nuclease.",

These non-vector-borne viruses identified here in ticks presumably originated from goats by blood-taking, and show the ecological relationship of pathogen circulation between vectors and hosts. In China, a metagenomic profile of viral communities in Rhipicephalus ticks from Yunnan province has also been conducted and has revealed a broad range of viral families (Xia et al., 2015) . Apart from phages, viruses from a variety of families including Herpesviridae, Poxviridae, Geminiviridae, Circoviridae and Virgaviridae, were identified in the Yunnan ticks, but not in this study, while viruses of the Reoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Adenoviridae were identified in this study but not in Yunnan ticks (Xia et al., 2015) . Such differences might be ascribed to: a) different methodologies of viral metagenomics; b) differences in the ways of sampling of ticks, since Yunnan ticks were collected by flag-dragging fields (Xia et al., 2015) , whereas ticks here were directly plucked from animals upon which they have fed; and/or c) different tick species within the two widely separated locations. However, bunyaviruses were present in both studies, suggesting a wide distribution of these viruses in different tick species and locations.",

SFTSV has a broad genetic diversity with high mutation rates (Lam et al., 2013) , and recombination and reassortment of SFTSVs frequently occur (Shi et al., 2017) . In this study, SFTSV was identified from two sites next to Xinyang, Henan province (Fig. 1C) , and were largely identical (up to 99.4% nt identities) to human viruses (HNXY_27 and 2012YSH37) identified in Xinyang (Huang et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2013b) , indicating that infections within the SFTS epidemic area covering Suizhou and Xingyang were caused by the same viruses. Here we also screened goat sera for SFTSV by RT-PCR, but no viremia was detected. IIFA testing of these sera showed high IgG levels against this virus but low neutralizing titers, indicating a rapid virus clearance in goats following SFTSV infection. Experimental infection of macaques with SFTSV has also showed an short viremic phase and undetectable viral RNA levels by day 7 following injection (Jin et al., 2015) . Considering the high seroprevalence of SFTSV in goats but low rate of SFTSV detection in ticks, the exact mechanism of virus circulation between vectors and vertebrate hosts remains unclear.",

Of note is that the seroprevalence of SFTSV in Suizhou was significantly higher than in Xiangyang (Figs. 1B and 6A). Along with the detection of SFTSV RNAs in ticks from Suizhou, all data indicate that circulation of SFTSV between animal hosts and vectors is wider in Suizhou, particularly in forest areas. Previous epidemiologic and environmental risk factor analyses of human cases in Xinyang, Henan province, and in Hubei province also proposed that shrub and forest regions showed strong associations with SFTSV infection (Liu et al., 2014a; Wang et al., 2017) . Such an association is undoubtedly related to the vector, H. longicornis, which is predominantly found in shrub and forest areas (Xu and Sun, 2003) .",

Here we identified NSDV in the same tick species in central China, thereby demonstrating a wider distribution of this virus in ticks in China. Viruses identified here and in the previous study are of two distinct strains, indicating that NSDV in China has a genetic diversity. Of note is that Chinese NSDVs showed a closer relationship with African strains than with Indian ones in the M and L segments (Fig. 5E-F) , suggesting an intriguing evolutionary route of this virus. Current data suggest that the most recent common ancestor of Chinese and African NSDVs existed within Indian viruses. Such a suggestion cannot be explained by geographic distribution, and it will be necessary to investigate NSDV epidemiologically over a wider area in China in order to determine if it is a true domestic virus or an imported one.",

Previous investigations have shown that this virus was not only isolated from ticks, humans, sheep, and mosquitoes in India and Africa, but that NP antibodies in human, sheep, goat and cattle sera were also reported (Dandawate et al., 1969a (Dandawate et al., , 1969b Joshi et al., 1998 Joshi et al., , 2005 Sudeep et al., 2009) . A possible reason for the negative sera in China is that the currently identified Chinese NSDVs are incapable of infecting goats to cause disease. This might explain why, although the virus does exist in China, no cases of NSD Table 1. have been reported. Unfortunately, we were unable to isolate this virus during both the present study and a previous one (31) either by cell culture or animal injection. TBDs are very difficult to control and prevent, and keep emerging or re-emerging (Fang et al., 2015) , largely because of limited knowledge of their background and complicated methods of circulation in nature.",

Following transfection of E. coli BL21(DE3) (Tiangen), the resulting rNPs were expressed after 0.5 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction and confirmed by SDS-PAGE and WB. The rNPs were purified and quantified by Ni-NTA His Bind Resins (Novagen) and the BCA Protein Assay Kit (CWBio). To prepare specific hyperimmune serum, the purified rNPs were injected intramuscularly into adult SPF mice (50 \u03bcg protein in complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma), 1:1 v/v). The same booster doses were administered at 14, 28 and 35 days following. Blood was collected from the orbital sinus for serum preparation and antibody titers were determined by rNP-based ELISA as described below.",
