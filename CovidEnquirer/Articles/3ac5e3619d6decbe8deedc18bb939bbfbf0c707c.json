We show that E1 expressed from cDNA is targeted to the Golgi region, as it is in infected cells. E1 proteins with precise deletions of the first and second or the second and third membranespanning domains were glycosylated, thus suggesting that either the first or third transmembrane domain can function as an internal signal sequence. The mutant protein with only the first transmembrane domain accumulated intracellulady like the wild-type protein, but the mutant protein with only the third transmembrane domain was transported to the cell surface. This result suggests that information specifying accumulation in the Golgi region resides in the first transmembrane domain, and provides the first example of an intracellular membrane protein that is transported to the plasma membrane after deletion of a specific domain.",

Membrane-bound and secreted proteins are sorted from cytoplasmic proteins and those destined for the nucleus or mitochrondria by virtue of a signal or leader sequence which directs insertion into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (Walter et al., 1984) . Plasma membrane and secreted proteins follow a similar pathway through the cell, from the rough endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi complex en route to the plasma membrane (Sabatini et al., 1982) . Other proteins in this exocytic pathway are retained at points along the way, such as cytochrome P-450 in the endoplasmic reticulum (Brands et al., 1985) and galactosyl transferase in the Golgl complex (Roth and Berger, 1982) . Lysosomal enzymes are sorted to lysosomes after passage through the Golgi complex. Some lysosomal enzymes are sorted via a specific marker, a mannose-6-phosphate modification of asparagine-linked (N-linked) 1 oligosaccharides of these enzymes, which is recognized by a receptor (Sly and Fischer, 1982) .",

Alternatively, as recently suggested by Kelly (1985) and Rothman (1986) , proteins that are destined for the plasma membrane or for constitutive secretion could move passively with the bulk flow of lipids, while proteins secreted in a regulated manner or those retained in intracellular membranes would possess signals which selectively retain them from moving with the bulk flow of membranes. A third model could invoke both positive signals that enhance the rate of incorporation of proteins into transport vesicles, and negative retention signals that ensure intracellular proteins to not be transported beyond a certain point.",

The coronaviruses provide an especially interesting model because they bud from intracellular membranes rather than from the plasma membrane. The best-studied members of the coronavirus group are mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Both viruses specify two glycoproteins called El and E2 (reviewed by Sturman and Holmes, 1985) . E2 forms the virion spike and can be detected in the plasma membrane as well as intracellular membranes of infected cells. In contrast, E1 accumulates intracellularly, and thus appears to play a critical role in intracellular budding of the virus. The viral nucleocapsid interacts with the MHV E1 protein, presumably the cytoplasmic tail, and virion budding occurs at the site of E1 accumulation in infected cells (Sturman et al., 1980; Dubois-Dalque et al., 1982; Tooze et al., 1984) .",

Studies that use protease treatment of intact virus (Sturman and Holmes, 1977; Cavanagh et al., 1986) or of E1 inserted into microsomal membranes support the model for the structure of El. Since there is no cleaved amino-terminal signal sequence , and the protein is inserted into microsomal membranes in a signal recognition particle-dependent manner (Rottier et al., 1985) , it has been suggested that one or more of the putative membrane-spanning domains functions as an internal, uncleaved signal sequence.",

The oligonucleotide used to generate the coding sequence for the mutant protein that lacked the second and third hydrophobic domains (Am2,3) was 5~ GTA~ATC~AACAAGACIL'TI~AAGC ~-3' and that for the mutant protein that lacked the first and second hydrophobic domains (Am1,2) was 5-'ICAGCI\"TTTTAAAGAGGGAGGICr'IGI'C GCAGC -3'.",

When transfected onto COS cells, which provide T antigen and thus support extensive replication of the vector (Gluzman, 1981) , high levels of protein can be expressed transiently from the late SV40 promoter. Initial attempts to detect the IBV E1 polypeptide in COS-1 cells transfected with this construct (pSV/IBVE1) were unsuccessful. These experiments were performed with a rabbit hyperimmune serum raised to purified virus, which immunoprecipitates IBV E1 from infected chick embryo kidney cells (Stern and Sefton, 1982a) . Although E1 could not be detected in transfected COS-1 cells, El-specific RNA was readily detected in dot blots (data not shown). Inability to detect the protein could have been the result of its instability or toxicity to cells, aberrant splicing from cryptic splice sites, and/or a low titer of antibodies to E1 in the anti-IBV serum. Results obtained with hybrid proteins between IBV E1 and VSV G protein suggested that at least one of the problems was an insufficient titer of antibodies to E1 in the anti-IBV serum (not shown).",

A peptide corresponding to this region of the polypeptide was chosen because it is likely to be the most accessible in the native protein. COS-1 cells infected with IBV were labeled 48 h after infection with [35S]cysteine, and the cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-E1 peptide serum. A single polypeptide of,,o32 kD was specifically immunoprecipitated by the anti-E1 peptide serum from IBV-infected cells (Fig. 2 A) . In contrast, the anti-IBV serum precipitated the nucleocapsid protein (N) as well as E1 and trace amounts of the spike glycoprotein, E2. The anti-peptide serum was therefore highly specific for IBV El. COS-1 cells transfected with DNA encoding IBV E1 were labeled 44 h after transfection with [35S]cysteine and subjeered to immunoprecipitation. A polypeptide co-migrating with E1 from infected cells was precipitated from COS-1 cells transfected with pSV/IBVE1 but not with the vector pJCll9 lacking the insert encoding E1 (Fig. 2 B) . A small amount of a 61-kD protein can also be observed in the immunoprecipitates from transfected cells (Fig. 2 B ; see also Fig. 7 A) . This band was specific for El-expressing COS-1 cells, but was not consistently observed. It is probable that it represents a dimer of El, as the MHV E1 protein has been shown to be susceptible to aggregation, especially when heated in the presence of SDS and reducing agent (Sturman, 1977) .",

Recombinant vaccinia virus encoding IBV E1 under control of an early vaccinia promoter was constructed as described (Mackett et al., 1984; Chakrabarti et al., 1985) . COS-1 cells infected with this recombinant virus (VVE1), or one encoding the VSV G protein (VVG), were labeled 5 h after infection with [35S]cysteine, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-E1 peptide serum.

The amino-terminal, glycosylated domain oflBV E1 in purified virus was recently shown to be susceptible to digestion with this enzyme (Cavanagh et al., 1986) . Transfected COS-1 cells were labeled for 90 min with [35S]cysteine, followed by a 90-min chase period. Cells were then treated with bromelain for 15 min. A parallel set of dishes were incubated in the absence of bromelain. Cells were washed and lysed, and E1 proteins were immunoprecipitated and subjected to electrophoresis in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Fig. 7 A shows that both wildtype E1 and the mutant Am2,3 are unaffected when intact cells are treated with bromelain. However, a proportion of the mutant protein Aml,2 is digested to a form which migrates slightly faster (arrowhead; \"~18 kD) than the nonglycosylated protein, suggesting that a portion of the amino terminus, including the oligosaccharides, has been removed from the protein.",

Thus to confirm the result above, we used recombinant vaccinia virus vectors to achieve a higher level of expression, and to allow use of another cell type. A recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the mutant E1 protein Aml,2 was constructed, and HeLa cells were infected with this virus or the recombinant vaccinia virus encoding wild-type El. The localization of both of these proteins in infected HeLa cells as determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was identical to that observed in transfected COS-1 cells (data not shown). Cells were labeled 5 h after infection with [35S]cysteine for 60 min, and then mock-treated, or treated with bromelain, pronase, or trypsin. After washing and lysing the cells, E1 proteins were immunoprecipitated and subjected to electrophoresis in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig.  7 B, the amino terminus of Aml,2, but not wild-type El, is susceptible to digestion with bromelain. The decrease in total amount of protein observed in bromelain-treated cells expressing both wild-type and mutant proteins (in Fig. 7, A and  B ) was a result of loss of cells and/or, cell lysis during the digestion. For this reason, pronase and trypsin were also included in the experiment shown in Fig. 7 B. When intact cells expressing Aml,2 were digested with pronase, a fragment of similar size to that obtained with bromelain was observed. Trypsin does not cleave the amino terminus of Aml,2, but since the only cleavage site in the amino-terminal domain is quite close to the membrane (Lys 19), this is not unexpected. Thus, the mutant E1 protein with only the third hydrophobic domain is indeed expressed at the cell surface. In a similar experiment using a chase period, virtually all of Aml,2 was digested to the smaller form (data not shown), suggesting Figure 6 .

The level of expression of IBV El obtained with the SV40-based expression vector and COS-1 cells was lower than expected by comparison to the other proteins we have expressed with the same vector (Rose and Bergmann, 1982; Guan and Rose, 1984) . Since IBV is an RNA virus which replicates in the cytoplasm of the cell, it is possible that aberrant splicing at cryptic splice sites occurs when the cDNA is introduced into the nucleus. Preliminary experiments using Northern blots suggested that a significant proportion of the El-specific message in transfected COS-1 cells lacks the 5' half of the coding sequence, including the initiation codon (our unpublished observations). We have obtained higher levels of expression of E1 using a recombinant vaccinia virus vector which replicates in the cytoplasm (Mackett et al., 1984; Chakrabarti et al., 1985) , and thus avoids the problem of aberrant splicing.

Mutant E1 proteins that lacked either the first and second or second and third membrane-spanning domains were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the coding sequence. We found that the mutant protein with only the first hydrophobic domain (Am2,3) or that with only the third hydrophobic domain (Aml,2) were both inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, since both were glycosylated with N-linked oligosaccharides. Thus, it appears that either the first or the third hydrophobic domain can function as an internal, uncleared signal sequence. Clearly, the third hydrophobic domain must also function as a membrane anchor because the mutant protein with only this hydrophobic domain is expressed on the plasma membrane. The first hydrophobic domain probably also functions as a membrane anchor, but further experiments using in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes followed by proteolysis would be required to prove this. There are several examples of proteins with a single membrane-spanning domain which serves to mediate membrane insertion as well as to anchor the protein in the lipid bilayer (Bos et al., 1984; Holland et al., 1984; Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986) . Also, some proteins that span the membrane several times have been demonstrated to have more than one internal, uncleaved signal sequence, as shown by site-directed mutagenesis and assessment of membrane insertion in vitro (Friedlander and Blobel, 1985; Mueckler and Lodish, 1986 ).",

The first explanation, lack of a positive signal for transport to the plasma membrane, seems unlikely. If this were the case, fusion of Glu 20 to Gly 77 to delete the first and second hydrophobic domains would have to create a positive signal for transport. We therefore favor the hypothesis that IBV E1 possesses a signal for retention in the Golgi region. This could be an active type of signal, where a specific sequence is recognized by another protein or lipids which are specifically retained in this region of the cell. Alternatively, the retention could be passive, resulting from structural properties of the protein which sterically constrain it from moving in the exocytic pathway, perhaps by inability to be incorporated into transport vesicles. The transport of E1 to the plasma membrane after removal of a retention signal would result if all membrane proteins move passively by bulk flow unless specifically held back. Alternatively, the protein could possess a positive signal for transport to the plasma membrane as well as a signal for intracellular retention, the latter being stronger. Removal of the retention signal would then result in transport of the protein to the plasma membrane. Further experiments designed to determine if signals for transport to the plasma membrane exist in other domains of E1 should allow us to distinguish these possibilities.",
