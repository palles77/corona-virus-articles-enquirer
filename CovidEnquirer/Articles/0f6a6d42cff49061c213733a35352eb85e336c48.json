Examination of 1024 swine sera showed a high specificity and a greater sensitivity of the ELISA, when compared with indirect immunofluorescence.

For PEDV serology, three tests have been described in the literature, namely an indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) (Prager and Witte, 1981a, b; Hofmann and Wyler, 1987) , an immunofluorescence blocking test (IFBT) (Witte and Prager, 1987) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) blocking test (Callebaut et al., 1982 ) .
