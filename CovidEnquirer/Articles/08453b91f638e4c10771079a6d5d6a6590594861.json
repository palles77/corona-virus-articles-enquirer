The bacteraemic level ranged from 3.0 9 10 1 to 8.9 9 10 3 CFU/mL in mongooses and was 7.0 9 10 3 CFU/mL in the masked palm civet. Multispacer typing (MST) analysis based on nine intergenic spacers resulted in the detection of five MST genotypes (MSTs 8, 14, 37, 58 and 59) for the isolates, which grouped in lineage 1 with MST genotypes of isolates from all CSD patients and most of the cats in Japan. It was also found that MST14 from the mongoose strains was the predominant genotype of cat and human strains. This is the first report on the isolation of B. henselae from small Indian mongooses and masked palm civets. The data obtained in the present study suggest that these animals serve as new reservoirs for B. henselae, and may play a role as potential sources of human infection.",

Since all of the isolates were identical in the nucleotide sequence of gltA, a representative isolate randomly selected from each bacteraemic animal was used for further genetic characterization.

            "text": "Phylogenetic tree of Bartonella henselae strains from mongooses, masked palm civet, cats and patients with cat-scratch disease (CSD) in Japan based on nine concatenated intergenic spacer sequences. The tree was constructed by using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) in MEGA4 software. The B. henselae strains isolated from mongooses, a masked palm civet, cats and humans with 57 MST genotypes were included in the analysis. Hatching highlights multispacer typing (MST) genotypes and the numbers of strains from the mongooses, a masked palm civet, cats and humans. The cat strains from the Philippines (*) and Thailand (*) and the cat and human strains from Japan ( \u2020) were analysed in the previous reports[13,21,22] and added to this figure. The number of cat strains examined in the present study is shown in parentheses. Dotted rectangles show four lineages of MST genotypes. The scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site.",
