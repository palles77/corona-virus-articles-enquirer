For this purpose, various samples of whole bacteria, fungi, pollen, media contaminated with viruses, and proteins were treated with an aliquot of methanolic tetramethylammonium hydroxide prior to thermal introduction into the ion source of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Molecular and fragment ions, consistent with fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and steroids (non-methylated and methylated), generated during electron ionization (70 eV) of the volatile hydrolysates were subsequently detected. The varying distributions and relative intensities of these ions were used to discriminate between the different biological samples. More specifically, it was found that polyunsaturated FAMEs and steroids could be used to differentiate eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells since the latter do not generally synthesize either of these lipid membrane constituents. Further discrimination of the different eukaryotic samples was made based on the detection of ergosterol for fungi, cholesterol for the viral media, and C18:3Me for pollen. Multivariate statistical analysis was employed to evaluate and compare the large set of mass spectra generated during the study and to build a trained model for predicting the class membership of test samples entered as unknowns. Of 132 different samples subjected to the model as unknowns, 131 were correctly classified into their proper biological categories. Moreover, 29 out of 30 bacteria test samples representing five species : S 0 1 6 5 -2 3 7 0 ( 0 1 ) 0 0 1 3 6 -X 66 A.J. Madonna et al. / J. Anal. Appl.

Early recognition of airborne pathogens would be extremely important in preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases.

Classification, based on varying distributions of fatty acids, has become a routine method in microbiology laboratories. A typical method involves saponification of whole microbial cells releasing glycerol bound fatty acids followed by methylation and subsequent extraction of the derivatized fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) into a nonpolar organic solvent. Separation and analysis of the FAME extract is then completed by gas chromatography (GC). Exemplifying this technique is the well known commercialized Microbial Identification System (MIDI) [18] .

Efforts to reduce the sample preparation time were successfully accomplished by Dworzanski [19, 20] and Holzer [21] . Both research groups utilized an on-line derivatization procedure in which whole bacterial cells, in the presence of strongly basic methylating reagents (e.g. tetramethylammonium hydroxide or trimethylanilinium hydroxide), were pyrolyzed in the injector block of the GC. Thermal hydrolysis and subsequent methylation of the cellular lipids was observed to occur nearly instantaneously during each heating cycle. The resulting chromatograms of the volatile methyl derivatives showed a high degree of similarity to FAME profiles obtained from extracts prepared by conventional wet-chemistry methods. Aside from coating a pyrolysis filament with a mixture of sample and derivatizing reagent, no further sample manipulation was necessary, hence reducing the chance of losing or contaminating the sample. The thermal hydrolysis/methylation (THM) technique required only 5-10 mg of sample, whereas the wet chemistry procedure required 10-15 mg of sample. Therefore, the THM process is better suited for situations involving low levels of analyte. A thorough review of on-line derivatization procedures using quaternary ammonium salts has been published [22] .",

These biological samples were chosen to emulate constituents normally found dispersed in the atmosphere. The aim of this current report was to identify characteristic biomarkers that could facilitate the differentiation of these samples from each other and from whole cell bacteria.

Positive identification of pathogenic bacteria collected during atmospheric sampling must include an initial step that is capable of differentiating the prokaryotic organism from a multitude of other possible airborne constituents.

Five replicate mass spectra were generated for each different sample by randomly alternating the order in which replicates of different samples were run. Bacteria samples were obtained from a continuous cell-line maintained at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). Cells were cultured using standard procedures and harvested by washing with distilled water. The cells were lyophilized and transferred to our laboratory where they were stored at \u2212 20\u00b0C until use. To ensure safe handling, each bacterial sample was gamma killed in a cobalt radiation source prior to shipment. Fungi samples purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were grown on potato dextrose agar for 8 days at room temperature. Mycelia were carefully removed from the agar surface, washed with distilled water, freeze dried and stored at \u2212 20\u00b0C. Lyophilized samples of cell culture media containing viruses were also received from the AFIP. A detailed description of how the media were prepared was previously published [27] . Pollen samples were hand collected from various locations in the Rocky Mountain region. Mortar and pestle were used to crush the dried pollen into a fine powder. A total of 10 mg of dried samples of bacteria, fungi, viral media, and pollen were resuspended in 1 ml of deionized water prior to application to the Curie-point filaments. The fungi suspensions were sonicated for 15 s in order to break apart the mycelia and produce more homogenous solutions. Standard protein samples (Sigma) were prepared as 1 mg ml \u2212 1 suspensions. Aliquots of 10 ml of each sample suspension were applied to Curie-point filaments, air-dried, and overlaid with 10 ml of the methanolic derivatizing reagent. The filaments were then introduced via direct inlet probe into the mass spectrometer.",

For each fungal species studied, a distinctive series of peaks (m/z 410, 396, 378, 363,337, and 253) were detected and identified as products of electron ionization of ergosterol. The mass peak observed at m/z 396 is the molecular ion of the free steroid while the mass peak observed at m/z 410 corresponds to the methylated derivative. The incomplete derivatization of ergosterol is attributed to the fact that steroids are weakly acidic and as such do not favorably methylate to form ethers during the THM process [22] . Chemically, this process involves the liberation of bound ergosterol and fatty acids by saponification and transesterification (competing mechanisms) following the application of an aliquot of a methanolic solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide to the intact fungal cells. The released fatty acids (as well as any naturally free fatty acids), being more acidic, are readily deprotonated in this highly basic medium and form salts with the quartenary ammonium cations. These salts thermally degrade (nucleophilic attack of the carboxylate anion upon the quartenary N-methylammonium cation) to FAMEs and tertiary amines when heated to a sufficiently high temperature.",

The predominant fatty acids synthesized by fungi are straight-chained and 16 or 18 carbons in length [30] . For each fungus analyzed, molecular ions for the methyl esters of hexadecanoic acid (C16:0), octadecanoic acid (C18:0), octadecenoic acid (C18:1), and octadecadienoic acid (C18:2) were detected (Fig. 1) . Unlike the situation with ergosterol, near complete thermal methylation was observed for the cellular fatty acids. A compiled list of FAMEs and their observed electron ionization molecular and fragment ions are listed in Table 2 . The common fragment ions detected included the series of carbomethoxy ions (185, 199, 213, 227, etc.) formed during electron ionization of saturated FAMEs. Also originating from Detection of C18:2, which is produced by most eukaryotic cells, is a valuable signatory marker since prokaryotic organisms usually do not produce polyunsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, the detection of FAMEs with two or more double bonds could be used to corroborate the presence of eukaryotic organisms. In addition, if mass peaks from ergosterol are also detected, then it may be inferred that the sample contains fungal cells. Unfortunately, fungi do not produce a large variety of fatty acids, as such; there is not much variation between different FAME profiles [31] . This limits the ability of using THM-MS to identify whole fungal cells at the genus or species level. However, the THM mass spectra exhibited by fungi do differ significantly from profiles generated by bacteria, pollen, viral infected media, and proteins.",

Two such media were examined by THM-MS and the mass spectra are shown in Fig. 2(a-b) . These two media were inoculated separately, one with feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), and the other with Venezuela Equine Encephalitis (VEE). For comparison, a non-infected medium (same medium used to propagate VEE) was also analyzed and is shown in Fig. 2(c) . From an earlier study, it was found that viruses do not contribute significantly to the overall mass spectrum from cell culture media [27] . The relative contribution of the viruses to the total mass of the cell culture medium is only about a tenth of a percent and accordingly does not generate an intense set of ion signals (relative to the cell culture media). Hence, the two mass spectra ( Fig.  7(b -c) ) of media recovered from Vero cell cultures (one with the virus the other without) are essentially indistinguishable. It was further discovered that the major source of fatty acids and steroids detected from the media supernatant originated from blood serum. Serum is commonly added to cell cultures as a rich supplement of proteins and lipids.",

This biomarker has also been detected from a purified mouse hepatitis virus [23] further substantiating its general use as a mammalian/viral signatory biomarker. For enveloped viruses, cholesterol is incorporated within the lipid bilayer that covers the viral protein coat. Furthermore, the virus acquires both steroids and lipids from the host and therefore the composition of these biomarkers will resemble the media that was used in propagation.

A lipid extraction was prepared off-line for sunflower pollen and analyzed using GC/MS. The elution peak corresponding to m/z 414 produced a mass spectrum that best matched sistosterol (comparison with unmethylated steroid in NIST database), a familiar pollen steroid [36] . Meanwhile, m/z 382 and m/z 354, were found in trace amounts and gave corresponding retention times and comparable mass spectra to C24:0Me and C22:0Me, repectively. The prominent peak at m/z 316 in the mass spectrum of sunflower (Fig. 3(d) ) was not found in the lipid extraction and will require addional examination for positive identification.",

Proteins were included as a comparative measure of the isobaric effects made by a biological compound containing no lipids. The mass spectra from three protein standards, mass analyzed following thermal treatment with TMAH, are shown in Fig. 4 . Peaks were observed at virtually every mass signifying the complicated nature involved with the thermal clevage of high molecular weight proteins. Thermal degradation coupled with electron ionization produces a mulititude of possible fragmentation mechanisms resulting in a complex mixture of predominantly low molecular weight gaseouse ions. The most abundant ions observed in the subsequent mass spectra are the smaller (generally below 150 Da), more volatile distillents. The ions observed in the mass spectra illustrated in Fig. 4 are most likely dipeptide remnants and diketopiperazines that were formed by a known intra-polypeptide cyclization mechanism [37] .",

The experimental setup was designed to enrich the cellular lipid fraction and minimize contributions from proteins, carbohydrates, and DNA. Lipid products, from thermal degradation of biological samples, are more volatile than other constituent biochemicals, especially for the mass range above 180 Da. Consequentially, by maintaining the transfer line from the heating chamber at lower temperatures (140\u00b0C), we could effectively prevent (by condensation onto the cold walls) less volatile thermal products from reaching the ion source. In fact, for proportionally similar amounts of samples, the total ion current (TIC) from whole cells (containing lipids) was an order of magnitude or more greater than the TIC produced from pure proteins. Needless to say, there does exist isobaric contributions from cellular proteins, but the overall contribution is minimal. In view of their negated significance to this study, no further attempt was made to identify the protein mass peaks demonstrated in Fig. 4 .",

Monounsaturated, C18:1 (m/z 296) fatty acid, is also prevalent to Gram-negative bacteria and is noticeable in both spectra by the appearance of the electron impact fragment ions at , was also detected in both spectra. Cyclopropyl heptadecanoic acid (cyC17:0), known to be produced by Y. pestis (and not by V. cholera) [40] , accounts for the greatest difference between the cellular fatty acid profiles of these two bacteria species. Chemical signals corresponding to the losses of 32 and 74 Da from the methyl ester of this cyclopropane fatty acid (m/z 282) were observed at m/z 250 and m/z 208, respectively. Each bacterium gave expected FAME profiles when compared to published data [40, 41] . The most abundant fatty acid detected for B. melintensis was cyclopropyl nonadecanoic acid (cyC19:0). The molecular ion for cyC19:0Me (M + , m/z 310) was observed (Fig. 5(d) The fifth bacterium analyzed during this study was F. tularensis.

C26:0, C25:0, C24:0, C24:1, C23:0, C:22:0, and C20:0 are all biosynthesized by F. tularensis [42] and were detected (see Table 2 for assigned mass to charge ratios) in the THM mass spectrum shown in Fig. 5(e) . Furthermore, a compliment of esterfied fatty acids of shorter length were also detected including: C18:0, C18:1, C16:0, and C14:0.

Drawing attention to Fig. 7(a) , it can be seen that the four peaks, m/z 294, 292, 270, and 264, are the most intense and all point in the negative direction. Thus, along PC1, samples which generated mass spectra with these peaks in high abundance will plot on the negative side of the axis while those samples with these peaks in lesser abundance will plot to the positive side. The polyunsaturated FAMEs are responsible for the grouping of both the pollen and fungi samples on the negative half of PC1. Several bacterial samples were also slightly negative along PC1. Both Y. pestis and V. cholera exhibited an intense C16:0Me peak while B. melintensis produced m/z 264 ([M-32] + , C18:1Me) in high abundance. The postive loadings are mainly the mass peaks extending from m/z 186 to m/z 230. This region of the mass spectrum appears to be most characteristic of the protein standards which consequently had the most positive scores on PC1. Although the viral media samples showed both FAME and steroid peaks in their mass spectra, they also contained high abundances of the lower mass peaks common to the proteins. On account of this proteinaceous influence, the viral media samples also grouped to the positive half of PC1. Futhermore, the cholesterol molecular ion (m/z 386), common only to the viral media samples, contributes to the slightly positive loading value for PC1.",

In fact, the influence of this biomarker on both PC1 and PC2 makes it possible to separate the pollen samples from the other classes. The fungi can be isolated due to the ergosterol peaks which cause this class to plot negative on the second factor axis. In addition, there is a large negative contribution to PC2 from m/z 264 and m/z 194, which together, causes the differentiation of B. melintensis from the other bacteria samples.",

This observation provides further support to the notion that these lipid biomarkers can, and do play a large part in differentiating different classes of organisms analyzed by mass spectrometry. For example, from the loading plot for PC3, it can be seen that mass peaks originating from ergosterol impart a positive contribution to the variance while the contribution from the odd-chain FAMEs (C15:0, C17:0) is in the opposite direction. Thus, PC3 can effectively be used to differentiate fungi from Gram-positive bacteria. tularensis, plotted to the positive half of PC4 due to the effects from C24:0Me, C24:1Me ([M-32] + ), C22:0Me, and C14:0Me to the variance in this direction. Because of the cholesterol molecular ion, the virus samples cluster on the lower half of PC4 while the protein samples fell almost exactly at the intersection formed by PC2 and PC4 (see Fig. 7(b) ).

Like the protein standards, the viral media samples also plotted in the right, upper quadrant (although their determined coordinates placed them to the left and above the protein samples). The most notable influence on the viral samples came from the loading for m/z 386 which is in the postive direction on CV2.

The extent to which these different lipid biomarkers were methylated was observed to be a function of their relative acidities. The fatty acid carboxylate cation was easily formed in the strongely basic milieu created during sample preparation while the hydroxyl funtionality of the steroids was much less prone to deprotonation in the same environment.
