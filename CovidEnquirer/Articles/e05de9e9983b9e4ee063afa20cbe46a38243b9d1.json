For that reason, we rather treated both types of knowledge as an outcome and used all the other risk perception variables as predictors.

One might indeed reason that travelers who plan to travel to an affected country would be more concerned by EVD and thus display higher levels of actual knowledge. However, even higher levels of actual knowledge and/or greater relevance of the situation are unlikely to change the overall pattern of results for several reasons. First, controlling for the destination country did not change the present results. Second, given the independent effects of actual and subjective knowledge showed here and in previous research (1), it is quite unlikely that higher levels of actual knowledge would change the overall pattern of results. Third, previous research (2) has shown that even highly concerned individuals like healthcare workers traveling to Ebola camps in Africa, who indeed displayed higher (average) levels of actual knowledge, were not immune to risk misperceptions: they underestimated their likelihood for contracting Ebola compared to their colleagues and, despite their high-risk status, they showed little concern about contracting Ebola during their mission. Finally, it is still informative to discover that despite intensive media coverage of the epidemic (as it was the case in France and other non affected countries), many people display a lack of knowledge and misperceptions about EVD (5), which could be important factors of dissemination in case of imported disease.",
