Recent years have seen the control and near-elimination of neurologic illness due to some viruses, through advancements in community hygiene and public health, societal awareness of preventive measures, and, importantly, vaccines against many viral pathogens. However, these advances have been countered by the emergence and re-emergence of new viral infectious agents; spread of these emerging infectious diseases has been facilitated by increasing global movement and transport of people, animals, and materials, changes in agricultural practices, war and natural disasters, and closer contact between humans and animals, among other things. Thus, viral neurologic infections will continue to be a significant source of ongoing morbidity and mortality worldwide for the foreseeable future.",

Epidemiology is essentially a science that assesses patterns of disease occurrence in human populations and the factors that influence these patterns (Lilienfeld and Stolley, 1994) ; the field of neuroepidemiology is simply the application of these epidemiologic principles to neurologic disorders. Epidemiologists are primarily interested in the occurrence of diseases as categorized by time, place, and person. Epidemiology attempts to determine whether there has been an increase or a decrease of disease over time, whether one geographic area has a higher frequency of disease than another, and whether the characteristics of persons with a particular disease or condition distinguish them from those without it. The epidemiology of a disease is determined by the fundamental relationships among components of the epidemiologic triad -host, agent, and environment. Attributes of the host, such as age, gender, race, and occupation, often provide insight as to who is at risk for a disease and what exposures may contribute to that risk. Similarly, an understanding of an agent's biologic, physical, or chemical properties may help focus attention on some of the most likely explanations for disease. Finally, an understanding of where things happened can help identify environmental determinants such as the physical, biologic, social, and economic factors that may have allowed or promoted interaction between host and agent.",

Neurologic illnesses often progress and change clinical characteristics over time; thus, the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis may be greater in persons with advanced illness, potentially leading to over-or underestimation of cases if evaluated early. Often, the actual timing of onset of a neurologic disease is not known, which may make determination of risk factors difficult. Persons with neurologic disorders may have altered mental status or memory deficits, making recall of past events and potential risk factors problematic. Finally, many neurologic illnesses are syndromes in which diagnosis rests upon an accurate interpretation of a constellation of physical and neurologic signs and symptoms, rather than diagnostic tests. This increases the potential risk of misclassification of cases.",

Once the definition of a case is determined, the number of such cases must be assessed in light of the population from which they are obtained. Rates are measures for relating cases to the population; with rate information, it is possible to determine whether one group or another is at increased risk of disease, and by how much.

Protective factors are attributes of the agent, host, and environment that decrease risk of the disease. Assessment of risk and protective factors involves the comparison of frequency of disease in a group exposed to those factors with disease frequency in the unexposed group. The relative risk (RR) is the ratio of risk of disease among persons in an exposed population to that in an unexposed population. RRs best reflect the effect of an exposure of interest when the groups being compared are similar in all variables being evaluated that might alter the RR except for the exposure of interest or when the RRs are adjusted to account for the known differences in these variables. An RR of 1.0 indicates identical risk in the compared groups; an RR greater than 1.0 indicates that those with the exposure have a higher risk than those without, and an RR less than 1.0 indicates the oppositethat those with the exposure have a lower risk than those without. It is important to differentiate the RR from the attributable risk (AR) -the absolute amount of risk directly due to exposure. AR is estimated from the difference between the risk of developing a disease in the exposed and unexposed groups. An AR of zero means that there is no difference in risk of disease between the exposed and unexposed groups. Pragmatically, in epidemiologic studies it is often useful to compare risk factors by looking at odds. The concept of odds is slightly different from that of risk, and is used when the total number of persons who may have been exposed to a situation or agent is not actually known, as is frequently the case in epidemiologic investigations. The odds of an event occurring is the probability that the event will occur divided by the probability that the event will not occur. Odds compare the number of ill persons known to be exposed to a particular factor to the number of non-ill persons known to be exposed to that factor:",

Disease surveillance is an ongoing process which involves the systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of reports on the occurrence of disease within a defined population; surveillance is a key component of public health activities (Teutsch and Churchill, 1994) . Surveillance for disease can be conducted on a number of different levels, such as community-based surveillance, hospital-based surveillance, or national surveillance. Syndromic surveillance, which assesses the occurrence of constellations of clinical features, is often used. Surveillance for disease may be either active or passive. Active surveillance utilizes a regular, systematic method to proactively contact reporting sources, review medical records, or otherwise identify cases to assess the occurrence of disease. Passive surveillance relies on the individual clinician, laboratory, or hospital initiating the report of the illness. Unlike with active surveillance, the absence of reported cases in passive surveillance may reflect failures to report rather than absence of identified cases. Active surveillance tends to provide more complete, timely, and accurate data, but is often more resource-intensive. Passive surveillance is often less resource-dependent and easy to implement, but may be less sensitive or complete in case ascertainment.",

Choice of these study designs is generally dictated by several factors, including the particular study question; the exposure frequency; the prevalence or incidence of the illness; and logistics. In a cohort study, subjects are classified on the basis of presence or absence of exposure to a particular factor, and then followed in time to assess the development of disease. Cohort studies may be either prospective (following subjects actively forward in time) or retrospective (where the outcome of interest has already occurred, and all of the follow-up has occurred in the past and all information is historical). Cohort studies are most useful to study common outcomes that may occur within short periods of time, or to study outcomes following a rare exposure. Cohort studies are useful in documenting the natural history of disease, and identifying particular risk factors for illnesses; population-based cohort studies may allow for determining incidence and prevalence of a disease.",

Case-control studies are most useful in studying diseases that are uncommon or have a long period between exposure and development of disease. Case-control studies may be subject to selection bias, since the association is being studied after exposure and disease have already occurred, and subjects are selected on the basis of having the outcome of interest. Case-control studies often involve matching, in which the cases and controls are made as similar as possible based upon various variables (age, sex, occupation) so as to highlight the particular risk factors that might result in disease in some and not in others. Matching of one case with more than one control (e.g., 1:2 matching, 1:4 matching) is often done to increase the power or ability to detect a statistically significant difference between cases and controls.",

Outbreak investigations may involve several concurrent epidemiologic methods, including surveillance, case series, case-control, and cohort studies. Each of these may be conducted in parallel or sequentially, depending upon the situation. Laboratory testing of biologic or environmental specimens, for etiologic confirmation, is often a critical component of outbreak investigations. The ultimate goals of an outbreak investigation are to determine the cause / etiology, and implement control measures in order to control and prevent further disease (Reingold, 1998) .",

The association can also be the result of bias or by confounding. Bias represents a systematic error in an epidemiologic study that results in an incorrect estimate of the association between exposure and risk of disease. There are several types of bias, including selection bias, in which subjects chosen for a study differ from those who would otherwise be eligible but were not included; and information bias, in which there is a systematic error in the measurement of data on exposure or outcome. For example, if we were to compare the incidence of transverse myelitis (TM) in the United States with that in certain African countries, we might find that TM is far more common in the United States. This may be reflective of a true higher incidence of TM in this setting; however, it may also reflect the fact that advanced diagnostic testing such as magnetic resonance imaging is more widely available in the United States, whereas in Africa the diagnosis is made by neurologic exam alone, which may be less sensitive.",

Some viral infections may initiate a vasculitis, producing central nervous system (CNS) effects through brain infarcts or focal neurologic deficits (Nagel et al., 2008) . In some cases, a combination of specific host factors and an infecting virus may produce indirect neurologic disease: this is the case for Reye syndrome that occurs shortly after salicylate treatment of children with various viral illnesses, particularly influenza and varicella-zoster infection (Glasgow and Middleton, 2001) . Although not the case for viruses, some infectious agents elaborate neurotoxins that can result in neurologic disease, as is the case for tetanus and dipththeria toxins produced by the bacteria Clostridium tetani and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, respectively. Finally, other end-organ damage from a viral infection may produce a concomitant neurologic illness indirectly (e.g., encephalopathy in the setting of viral hepatitis-associated liver failure). Neurologic illness with any particular virus may be a result of one or several of these mechanisms. The epidemiology of viral-associated neurologic illness is in part influenced by which of the mechanisms above is associated with a particular virus.",

Of critical importance is the host-agent relationship, which is dependent upon various features and characteristics of both the infecting agent, as well as the particular properties or characteristics of the person who is infected (host) (Mandell et al., 2005) . Both of these factors influence the occurrence and pattern of human infections, and need to be considered in tandem. Various features of the infecting agent may influence the occurrence of disease (Mandell et al., 2005) . Infectiousness describes the relative ease or difficulty by which an agent may be transmitted to other hosts; respiratory or droplet-spread agents tend to be more infectious than those spread by close person-to-person contact, for instance. Infectivity relates to the ability of an infectious agent to enter, survive, and multiply in a host, and is generally estimated by assessing the number of hosts infected in the context of the number of susceptible and exposed individuals.",

            "text": "Pathogenicity is the ability of an agent to cause clinical disease in a host once infection occurs; although this is in large part related to specific characteristics of the infectious agent, host susceptibility may also play a large role in pathogenicity. Similarly, virulence refers to the relative severity of infection caused by a pathogenic agent, and refers to the numbers of serious or disabilityproducing infections compared to the total number of infected persons. Immunogenicity is the ability of an infecting agent to stimulate an immunologic response in the host; this in part determines the pathogenicity and virulence of a particular agent, and is an important determinant of whether infection confers long-lasting immunity to the agent. Nearly all of these agent factors are substantially influenced by concomitant host factors. For instance, the pathogenicity of a particular agent may be greatly increased in persons with particular risk factors, such as weakened immunity or extremes of age. The virulence of a particular agent may similarly be influenced by particular host risk factors. Another important influential determinant of virus epidemiology is the route of transmission; this is the pathway by which an infectious agent is spread through the environment or to another person (Mandell et al., 2005) . Direct-contact spread involves passing an infectious agent directly from one person to another by way of respiratory droplets, touching, kissing, or sexual intercourse, or by exposure of susceptible tissue to the agent, for instance through a rabid animal bite. Indirect transmission includes vehicle, vector-borne, and air-borne transmission. Vehicle transmission involves a material that serves as an intermediate by which an infectious agent can gain access to the host, for instance by food, water, biological tissues (blood, urine), or objects (fomites). Vector-borne infections are spread when an insect vector transmits an infectious agent mechanically, as in a bite, directly to the host. Air-borne transmission occurs when aerosols containing infectious agents disseminate to a host and gain entry to the host through some portal, generally the respiratory tract. Air-borne transmission requires infectious particles to be 1-5 mm in diameter, smaller than respiratory droplets (Polymenakou et al., 2008) .",

Some viral infections result in sporadic cases of neurologic disease, with no specific temporal or geographic pattern. Infections may also have an endemic pattern, in which cases of illness predictably occur among members of the population at a certain frequency. In some cases, infections may result in regular, predictable seasonal increases in numbers of cases, due to various geoclimactic or population factors. Others may result in epidemics, in which large numbers of cases of illness occur in a particular geographic area and over a specific period of time; these epidemics may occur on a predictable basis, but more commonly occur in an unpredictable fashion. An epidemic occurring within a large geographic area, typically affecting many countries in multiple continents, is referred to as a pandemic. Following a certain period of time, an infectious agent that initially resulted in epidemic disease may become endemic in a population (e.g., occurring regularly within the native population); this shift from epidemic to endemic disease has most recently been demonstrated by West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States.

Clinically, it is characterized by the acute onset of headache, encephalopathy or alteration of mental status, focal neurologic signs, and seizures. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is characterized by moderate pleocytosis and protein elevation. There are many different etiologies that may lead to encephalitis, including toxic agents, neoplastic causes, and immune-mediated disorders; however, the most commonly identified causes of encephalitis are infectious agents, particularly viruses. In many cases, however, a definitive underlying etiology for encephalitis can be elusive; even with extensive testing for infectious or chemical etiologies, up to 60% of cases of encephalitis remain without a definitive underlying etiology (Glaser et al., 2003; Granerod et al., 2010) . This likely attests to both the wide range of potential infectious pathogens, toxic substances, and environmental factors that may result in encephalitis, as well as limitations on the sensitivity and repertoire of laboratory testing currently available to identify potential etiologies. The epidemiology of encephalitis is complex, and estimates of incidence rates vary widely. This is due in part to differences in case definitions between studies, differences in diagnostic capabilities, and geographic location in which studies have been conducted. Most studies of encephalitis have been hospital-based, and assess endemic disease. Estimated overall rates among all ages have been between 1 and 6 cases / 100 000 persons per year in most hospital-based studies (Klemola et al., 1965; Ponka and Pettersson, 1982; Radhakrishnan et al., 1987) ; one population-based study estimated an incidence of 7.4 cases / 100 000 persons per year (Nicolosi et al., 1986) . Most studies suggest that encephalitis is more frequently observed in younger persons; in children and adolescents, incidence estimates range from 1 to 16 cases per 100 000 per year in children (Rantakallio et al., 1986; 72 J.

It is important to keep in mind that most studies of the incidence and epidemiology of encephalitis have been conducted in industrialized countries, and that the epidemiology of encephalitis in the developing world is less well described. Case fatality rates and estimates of neurologic sequelae also vary, depending upon study methods and underlying etiologic agent. Population-and hospital-based estimates of neurologic sequelae following encephalitis have ranged from 0.35 to 2.7 per 100 000 population Rantala et al., 1991; Sejvar et al., 2008a) , with case fatality rates ranging from 1% to 10% . However, certain agents are associated with higher case fatality rates; mortality of up to 33% has been reported with herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) (Skoldenberg and Forsgren, 1985) . The etiology and epidemiology of viral encephalitis will vary based upon a number of variables, including age group affected, geographic location, and underlying immune status of affected individuals. Some viruses lead to sporadic cases of encephalitis. This is particularly true in the case of alpha-herpesviruses, which include herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, and VZV. Herpesviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses and are ubiquitous throughout the world (Skoldenberg, 1996; Hjalmarsson et al., 2007; Steiner et al., 2007) . HSV-1 is the most common cause of identified sporadic viral encephalitis worldwide, and in the United States accounts for 20% of all cases with a defined etiology, with an incidence of approximately 2 cases per million population (Steiner et al., 2007) . HSV-2 more typically produces genital cutaneous lesions, but may also cause encephalitis, accounting for approximately 5% of HSE overall (Johnson, 1998) . Less commonly, it may result in aseptic meningitis. HSE occurs worldwide and throughout the year, with no seasonal variation. Spread of the virus is through direct close contact, and HSV-1 infection is influenced by socioeconomic factors, with lower socioeconomic status associated with earlier and more frequent infection (Skoldenberg, 1996) . The age distribution of HSE appears to be bimodal, with peaks at ages 5-30 years, and then over 50 years. Currently, specific risk factors for the development of HSE are not known.",

Although predominantly a febrile rash illness, neurologic disease with varicella is not uncommon, with the overall incidence of CNS disease estimated to be 1-3/10 000 clinical cases (Guess et al., 1986) . The most commonly reported CNS manifestations are acute encephalitis and cerebellar ataxia. Encephalitis may occur in approximately 1-2 per 10 000 cases of clinical varicella (Choo et al., 1995) ; although most total varicella cases occur in children, incidence of neurologic disease associated with varicella illness is highest in adults over age 20, and infants <1 year (Guess et al., 1986) . Cerebellar ataxia is somewhat more common, affecting approximately 1 in 4000 cases (Guess et al., 1986) . Case fatality from varicella encephalitis varies considerably, ranging from 5% to 35%, and long-term sequelae may be seen in 10-20% of survivors (Guess et al., 1986) .",

Enteroviral infections, while more commonly associated with aseptic meningitis (see below), may result in seasonal epidemics of viral encephalitis in temperate areas. Enteroviruses have a worldwide distribution, and may produce endemic viral encephalitis, or large outbreaks of encephalitis affecting large populations. Recently, large outbreaks of enterovirus-71-associated illness have occurred and resulted in large numbers of cases of severe neurologic illness, primarily in children (Solomon et al., 2010) . Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are among the most common causes of epidemic encephalitis worldwide (Gubler, 2001) . Arboviruses refer to a class of viruses that are transmitted by arthropod vectors, generally mosquitoes or ticks (Calisher, 1994; Gubler, 2001) . They all have complex life cycles involving enzootic transmission between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, which allows for the virus to become increasingly prevalent in the environment (amplification). Humans become infected following the bite of an infected arthropod vector. While most human infections with arboviruses result in clinically silent illness or mild febrile illness, more severe manifestations, including hemorrhagic fever, aseptic meningitis, and encephalitis, may result.",

Most arboviruses produce endemic illness with periodic large outbreaks; these outbreaks are dependent upon a complex interaction of geoclimactic factors that favor increased populations of arthropod vectors, sufficient populations of amplifying hosts, and susceptible human populations. For instance, St. Louis encephalitis virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus found in North America and, to a limited extent, South America, results in sporadic cases of encephalitis yearly, predominantly in late summer or fall. However, periodic focal outbreaks involving hundreds of cases have occurred at intervals in various regions of the United States (Luby et al., 1969; Zweighaft et al., 1979) . Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), another flavivirus transmitted by mosquito vectors, is the most important cause of encephalitis throughout Asia (Misra and Kalita, 2010) . In areas with endemic transmission, incidence of Japanese encephalitis in children aged <15 years is approximately 2.5 / 100 000 population, with case fatality estimated at 25% (Solomon et al., 2000) . However, in temperate areas, Japanese encephalitis may result in frequent and large epidemics, with attack rates of up to 20 cases per 100 000.",

Enteroviruses are made up of over 70 different serotypes within the family Picornaviridae, and many of these different serotypes may result in aseptic meningitis. Enteroviruses are distributed worldwide, and the epidemiologic pattern varies with geographic location. In temperate areas, enteroviral infections occur with a distinct summer / fall seasonal distribution; in tropical and subtropical areas, there is a higher year-round incidence of infection. Enteroviruses are spread from person to person by a fecal-oral route; transmission may also occur through the respiratory route, usually through direct contact with nose and throat discharges or through aerosol droplets or through contaminated food or water (Lee and Davies, 2007) . Humans are thought to be the only natural reservoir of enteroviruses (Mandell et al., 2005) . While there are many different serotypes of enteroviruses that may result in aseptic meningitis, in any particular geographic location infection is generally dominated by only a few of these serotypes (Glass et al., 2001 ). It appears that certain enterovirus serotypes are more commonly associated with aseptic meningitis.",

Prior to the advent of vaccination, far and away the most common cause of anterior myelitis was infection with poliovirus, a small 76 J. SEJVAR enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae (Mandell et al., 2005) . Poliovirus has historically been so strongly associated with the syndrome of anterior myelitis that the term \"poliomyelitis\" has become synonymous with the syndrome. There are, however, a number of other viruses that are important causes of anterior myelitis, including some other enteroviruses, arboviruses, and herpesviruses (Solomon and Willison, 2003) . The epidemiology of poliovirus anterior myelitis has undergone significant changes in the past decades. The syndrome has been recognized for centuries; however, detailed descriptions of the clinical illness did not begin to appear until the 1700 s. Until the late 19th century, poliomyelitis was only associated with sporadic cases of acute limb weakness (Nathanson and Kew, 2010) . However, beginning in the late 1800 s, large summertime outbreaks of poliomyelitis began occurring in northern Europe and the United States (Mandell et al., 2005) . This shift from sporadic disease to large epidemics has largely been attributed to improved hygiene in these areas, which resulted in lack of exposure to the virus in infancy. Exposure in early childhood generally produced mild infections due to the presence of passively acquired maternal antibody; these mild infections, however, resulted in the development of inherent immunity, affording ongoing protection. Infections later in life result in more severe neurotropic disease, thus leading to increasing burden from poliovirus infections (Nathanson and Kew, 2010) .",

However, acute flaccid paralysis surveillance during the 1960s and 1970s suggested that the prevalence of limb paralysis, mostly attributable to poliovirus infection, in populations of the developing world was between 2 and 11/1000 population (Henderson, 1984) , a rate exceeding that of poliomyelitis in peak epidemic years in the United States. Most cases of poliomyelitis in developing countries occur in young children between 6 months and 2 years. Because poliomyelitis in developing countries is largely endemic rather than epidemic, and there is a high incidence of other causes of severe physical disabilities in these areas, poliomyelitis had received less public concern. However, beginning in 1974, the World Health Organization began making concerted efforts toward the worldwide control of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, including poliomyelitis. By 2002, fewer than 1900 cases of poliomyelitis were reported worldwide, strictly among a handful of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009a) . However, in recent years, there have been several setbacks in this goal, with several large outbreaks of poliomyelitis occurring in Tajikistan, the Republic of Congo, and elsewhere. Such setbacks have been due to a variety of problems, including a less developed infrastructure in developing countries contributing to limitations in both the effectiveness of the oral poliovirus vaccines themselves (e.g., more potentially interfering enteric viruses in recipients) and to decreased capacity to implement the multiple vaccination campaigns required to maintain high population levels of immunity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009b) . New strategies are not being introduced to reach the elusive goal of poliomyelitis eradication.",

Cases of anterior myelitis have occurred in several notable large outbreaks of enterovirus-71 in Malaysia, Taiwan, and other Asian countries (Solomon et al., 2010) , although the usual neurologic complication of this virus is acute encephalitis. Arthropod-borne flaviviruses have recently emerged as an important cause of infectious myelitis, with large outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis associated with cases of 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 myelitis in endemic and epidemic regions (Solomon and Vaughn, 2002; Solomon and Willison, 2003) ; during the North American WNV epidemic, incidence of WNV myelitis was estimated to be up to 3.7 / 100 000 population (Sejvar et al., 2005) . Herpesviruses, particularly VZV and HSV-1, have been associated with sporadic cases of myelitis worldwide (Guess et al., 1986) .

This is particularly true for several retroviruses, including human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV), types I and II, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HTLV-I infection is associated with adult T-cell leukemia; however, it also may cause tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM) (Araujo and Silva, 2006; Cooper et al., 2009 ). HTLV-I has a worldwide distribution, but has focal concentrations in certain populations; seroprevalence for the virus is particularly high in certain districts in Japan and in the Caribbean (Araujo and Silva, 2006) . The virus is transmitted primarily through sexual contact, contaminated blood, or perinatally through breast milk. Onset of TSP-HAM is most frequent in the fourth and fifth decades, although younger ages of onset may occur, and it is more common in females. The onset of illness is slow and progressive, with the development of backache, leg stiffness, and dysesthesias, as well as weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar responses. Upper extremities are generally spared. Sensory loss, particularly to vibration and position sense, may occur, and in some cases a concomitant peripheral neuropathy may develop (Grindstaff and Gruener, 2005) . The illness is generally progressive, leading to gait difficulties. An illness resembling TSP-HAM has been observed with infection with HTLV-II, which appears to be particularly prevalent among Native Americans (Roucoux and Murphy, 2004) . Among the various neurologic manifestations that it may cause, HIV can be associated with a progressive vacuolar myelopathy (Berger and Sabet, 2002) . Herpesviruses and enteroviruses can also uncommonly be associated with myelopathy (Berger and Sabet, 2002) .",

It is thought that various mutations in the infecting measles virus allow for establishment of a persistent infective state within the nervous system; various pathophysiologic mechanisms for this persistent infection have been hypothesized, but none has been proven. SSPE primarily affects children and adolescents, with more than 85% of cases being between 5 and 15 years of age (Gutierrez et al., 2010) . Typically there is a history of measles rash illness with uneventful recovery; several years later, affected persons develop insidious onset of behavioral changes, neurocognitive impairment, and movement disorders followed by frank dementia; signs of acute encephalitis are not present. The illness is generally fairly rapidly progressive, with death occurring between several months and 3 years after onset, generally due to secondary complications. Epidemiologic studies of SSPE suggest that males are twice as likely to develop the syndrome as females; cases are more common in children from rural areas than from urban settings (Modlin et al., 1979) . There has been some evidence for geographic clustering of cases of SSPE, with incidence in the United States being highest in southeastern and midwestern states (Modlin et al., 1979) . In the United States, the incidence of SSPE has decreased dramatically since the 1960s: the mean annual incidence of SSPE in 1960 was 0.61 per million persons under age 20, compared with 0.06 cases per million in 1980 (Modlin et al., 1977 (Modlin et al., , 1979 . This decrease in SSPE correlates with the use of live attenuated measles vaccine starting in 1963. Despite concerns that the attenuated measles vaccine may itself represent a risk for development of SSPE, the overall risk for SSPE following measles infection has been estimated to be 29 times greater than that following measles vaccination (Halsey et al., 1980) . Earlier measles infection appears to carry a greater risk, with the risk of SSPE following measles infection before age 18 months greater than infection at older ages. Despite a dramatic decline in cases of SSPE in the developed world, SSPE continues to occur in the developing world and areas where measles vaccine is not widely used (Bellini et al., 2005; Campbell et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "PML is a rare, progressive demyelinating neurologic disorder due to persistent infection with JC virus (JCV), a human polyomavirus (Scheld et al., 1997) . Infection with JCV appears to be extremely common, with infection occurring in childhood, but in most individuals is asymptomatic. Estimates have suggested that nearly 80% of adults in the United States and Europe have antibodies to JCV, with seropositivity increasing during childhood. The overall pathogenesis of JCV and how it leads to PML is not understood, but it is hypothesized that viremia during primary infection results in persistent latent infection of the kidneys and, possibly, mononuclear cells (Mandell et al., 2005) . During periods of immunosuppression, it is thought that latent virus within kidney cells reactivates. Clinically, PML most often presents with progressive focal neurologic deficits, including hemiparesis, visual field deficits, and ataxia, as well as neurocognitive impairment. Most involvement is within the cerebral white matter, with progressive patchy or confluent demyelination. Patients generally undergo rapid deterioration, with death occurring within 6 months of onset. Definitive diagnosis of PML is based upon detection of JCV in brain tissue or CSF by polymerase chain reaction or virus isolation. Prior to the emergence of HIV, PML was uncommon, occurring mostly in older individuals with underlying hematologic malignancies or other severe immunosuppression. In the HIV era, the epidemiology of PML has undergone substantial and interesting changes. Subsequent to the emergence of HIV, reported PML deaths rose considerably; the age-adjusted death rate from PML in the United States increased 20-fold, from 0.2 per million persons in 1984 to 3.3 per million persons in 1994 (Holman et al., 1998) . PML-associated death rates peaked in the mid-1990s, however, and subsequently there has been a decrease in PML-associated deaths, from 2.76 deaths per million persons in 1992 -1995 to 0.66 in 2002 -2005 . This decrease has corresponded to the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) in the treatment of HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States (Clifford et al., 1999; Christensen et al., 2010) .",

The causative agent of these illnesses is thought to be a transmissible proteinaceous particle devoid of nucleic acid (a misfolded prion protein, PrPsc) (Belay, 1999; Johnson, 2005) . The normal form of the prion protein is a normal cellular protein with an unclear function (cellular PrP, PrPc). A transformation of the normal prion protein into an abnormal configuration (PrPsc, see below) changes the physicochemical properties of the protein; the resultant aberrant protein is extremely resistant to typical methods of denaturation such as heat, chemical, or radiation exposure. This form of the protein has the capacity for self-replication; transformation of PrPc to PrPsc may occur sporadically but rarely, in genetically normal individuals, or the transformation may be facilitated and occur commonly in persons with certain genetic mutations that alter the amino acid sequence of the prion protein. It is unclear how PrP replicates, but it has been proposed that the combination of PrPsc with a PrPc molecule results in the formation of a heterodimer intermediate that subsequently forms two PrPsc molecules; this becomes a selfperpetuating process in which exponentially increasing numbers of PrPc are converted to abnormal PrPsc (Hu et al., 2008) . The accumulation of PrPsc in nervous system tissue results in neuronal damage characterized by vacuolar changes, resulting in a spongiform appearance of neural parenchyma at histopathology, and giving the prionopathies the nomenclature of \"transmissible spongiform encephalopathies\" (TSEs) (Belay, 1999) .",

In all subtypes, CJD generally begins clinically with cognitive deterioration, including dementia, behavioral problems, and other cortical signs (Johnson, 2005) . During the course of disease, additional neurologic signs will develop, including myoclonus, ataxia, and extrapyramidal features. Cognitive decline is progressive, and although longer survival times have been reported, most patients die within 6-9 months of diagnosis. The most common form of CJD is sporadic CJD (sCJD), in which by definition there is neither a mutation in the prion protein nor a clear environmental source of infection. sCJD is uncommon, and occurs worldwide, with an incidence of about 1 per million population per year in North America and Europe (Brown and Mastrianni, 2010) . The incidence may be slightly less in Asia (Shi et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2010; Nozaki et al., 2010) , and little is known about the epidemiology of sCJD in sub-Saharan Africa. sCJD is an illness of advanced age, with a mean age at onset of approximately 62 years; the age-adjusted incidence of sCJD in persons 65 years and older is approximately 5 per million per year. There is no gender difference; in the United States, the ageadjusted incidence of sCJD is 2.7 times higher in whites than blacks . A number of epidemiologic studies have been conducted to assess for possible risk factors for sCJD; however, aside from age and a family history of CJD, no consistent risk factors have been identified (Belay and Schonberger, 2005; Ward et al., 2008; Ruegger et al., 2009) .",

Early on, a link between this \"new variant\" CJD (now variant CJD, vCJD) and BSE in cattle was suspected, based upon several lines of epidemiologic and pathologic data, and suggested transmission of the BSE prion agent from cattle to humans (Collinge, 1997) . The BSE epidemic began in 1985 , and peaked during 1992 -1993 , with a decline following the prohibition of using ruminant protein, which presumably contained BSE-infected brain and spinal cord, as feed for other ruminants.",

SEJVAR the most important social revolutions in history -the virtual elimination of the infectious disease as a significant factor in social life\" (Davis and Lederberg, 2001) . This view had been bolstered by recent successes, including the worldwide eradication of smallpox, the development of effective antimicrobial and antiviral drugs, and dramatic improvements in public health and sanitation; the possibility that infectious diseases would no longer pose a continued threat to humans seemed quite promising. Unfortunately, recent decades have seen the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases on a wide scale (Table 3 .2). The emergence of HIV and AIDS in the There are a number of social, cultural, and epidemiologic factors that are thought to play an ever-increasing role in the emergence and re-emergence of various infectious diseases (Davis and Lederberg, 2001 ):",

            "text": "1. Demographics-the world's population is now estimated to increase by over 350 000 persons per day (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/pcwe). In certain regions of the world, this population growth rate is even higher. Such population growth has numerous effects, including an increase in population and housing density with the associated breakdown in hygienic infrastructure; increased migration within and between populations; and encroachment of human populations upon wildlife habitats, increasing the chances for zoonotic transmission of infectious agents. 2. Social/behavioral changes -several aspects of human behavior directly or indirectly foster the emergence of infectious diseases. Sexual behavioral practices can lead to the spread of sexually transmitted disease (STDs), and foster the spread of emerging and re-emerging STDs, with HIV and the re-emergence of syphilis serving as prime examples. The increase in world travel, and the speed in which that travel may be accomplished, facilitates the spread of agents around the globe, as has been seen with the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Even activities such as keeping exotic pets have been linked to emerging zoonoses, as was seen in an outbreak of monkeypox in the midwestern United States. 3. Advances in healthcare -recent beneficial accomplishments in human healthcare have had implications on infectious disease emergence. Advances in chemotherapy and immunomodulation, while of tremendous benefit, have set the stage for a surge in opportunistic infections. Transplantations themselves have been associated with several cases of transmission of encephalitic agents, including recent cases of transplant-associated rabies, WNV, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Invasive procedures have similarly carried with them the risk of introduction of infectious pathogens in unusual settings. 4. Changes in treatment of water/food -as the food and agricultural industries shift more and more to massproduction paradigms, the potential for food-borne infectious disease outbreaks to occur on a large scale has increased. What in the past would have been limited to local outbreaks of food-borne illness have now become multistate or multinational epidemics, leading to hundreds or thousands of cases of illness spread over vast geographic areas. This has been seen recently in outbreaks of Escherichia coli associated with salad greens, and with cases of bacterial infections from tainted meat products. Sometimes animal feed practices have been associated with continued spread of an epidemic; the practice of feeding meat-and-bone meal from rendered cattle presumably infected with the BSE agent is thought to be the mechanism of amplification of the outbreak of mad cow disease in the United Kingdom. 5. Microbial evolution -the emergence of a new disease often represents natural evolution and change of the agent in question, leading to increased virulence in humans. In some cases, the use of antimicrobials leads to selection for microbes that are resistant to the agents, and may select for strains that have increased virulence. Increased antibiotic resistance among some of the more common pathogenic agents is likely to continue to be a problem. 6. War / natural disasters -wars and conflicts lead to a breakdown of public health infrastructure, increasing the likelihood of outbreaks of various diseases. Similarly, natural disasters may lead to similar public health breakdowns, increasing the likelihood of infectious disease outbreaks. 7. Deliberate release of pathogens -although biowarfare and bioterrorism have existed since antiquity, the potential for mass casualties due to the deliberate use of biologic agents in war or terrorism has grown concomitant with the dynamics and changing demographics of modern urban society.",

WNV historically had been associated with infrequent outbreaks of mild, nonspecific febrile illness, mainly among children and young adults, in areas throughout Africa and the Middle East (Hayes, 1989; Solomon et al., 2000; Thakare et al., 2002) , with several larger outbreaks occurring in Romania, Russia, and Israel in the mid-and late 1990s. The first relatively large outbreak of WNV with significant numbers of neurologic illness occurred in Romania in the summer of 1996 (Ceausu et al., 1997; Campbell et al., 2001) ; until that time, neurologic illness with WNV was infrequently reported. In 1998, however, a large outbreak of WNV with significant numbers of neurologic cases occurred in Israel (Chowers et al., 2001) . In the summer of 1999, however, an unusual clustering of cases of encephalitis was identified in New York City; due to serologic testing difficulties, the outbreak was initially attributed to St. Louis encephalitis virus, an arbovirus closely related to WNV. However, subsequent testing identified the agent as WNV, the first time it had appeared in North America. Since that time, WNV has spread dramatically throughout North America, producing the largest consecutive outbreaks of viral encephalitis in the western hemisphere, with activity now reported in all 48 contiguous US states, and in parts of southern Canada. The epidemic peaked in 2003, and WNV activity has subsequently declined; however, the future epidemiologic pattern of the virus remains unclear. Mosquito, avian, and equine circulation has also been seen in the Caribbean and in Central and South America. As of January 2011, there have been over 30 000 human cases in the United States, including >12 000 neuroinvasive disease cases and >1200 deaths.",

Another recent example is the emergence of Nipah virus in South Asia. In 1998 a large outbreak of encephalitis occurred in Malaysia, mainly among abattoir workers. The outbreak was quickly recognized as being associated with exposure to swine, and as a result the outbreak was initially attributed to JEV, an arbovirus in which pigs serve as intermediate hosts, and which was known to cause illness in the area. Subsequent laboratory testing, however, excluded JEV, and the infecting agent eventually was discovered to be a new paramyxovirus; this virus was closely related to the recently described hendraviruses, and to measles virus (Dixon et al., 1999; Bhangoo et al., 2005) . The virus was named Nipah virus (NiV), based upon the location of its first isolation. Since its recognition, Nipah virus has caused outbreaks of severe encephalitis in a number of countries in South Asia, most notably Singapore, Indonesia, and Bangladesh (Anonymous, 2004; Hsu et al., 2004; Bhangoo et al., 2005; Reynes et al., 2005) . Nipah virus is a zoonotic agent, and is transmitted to humans through exposure to secretions from animals, primarily pigs and bats of the Pteropus genus (Kang et al., 2003; Wacharapluesadee et al., 2005) . Human-to-human transmission has been thought to be uncommon, but evidence from recent outbreaks suggests that it may occur. To date, outbreaks of Nipah virus have been infrequent and have remained geographically self-limited. The possible widespread transmission of this emerging zoonotic disease is at present unclear.",

Fortunately, in the recent past such intentional attacks have been infrequent. Perhaps the most notable recent event has been the anthrax attacks in the northeastern United States of 2001 (Jernigan et al., 2001) . The greatest concern for weaponization of viral agents centers on variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, an arbovirus of the Togavirus family, and the viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola and Marburg viruses, filoviruses that have been associated with periodic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fever. Although the weaponization of these viruses remains difficult, advances in technology and human creativity unfortunately render this plausible.",
