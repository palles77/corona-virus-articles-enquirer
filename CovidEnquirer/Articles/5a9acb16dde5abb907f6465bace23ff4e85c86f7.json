The purpose of this study was to investigate the demographic and clinical characteristics of ED adult patients before, during and after the SARS epidemic in a SARS-dedicated hospital. Methods: A retrospective, ED chart review was conducted, and demographic data were obtained from a computer database, for a total of 17,586 patients. Patient information, including age, gender, mode of arrival, triage category, time of visit, main diagnosis, use of ED services, and status after the ED visit, were collected and compared for pre-, early-, peak-, late-, and post-SARS epidemic stages. Results: Demographic data demonstrated a significant decrease in patient attendances per day, with a mean reduction of 92.5 8.3 patients (43.7 3.9% reduction in rate; p < 0.01) during peak-versus pre-epidemic stages, but revealed no differences in patient age and gender. The numbers of patients with ambulance transport, inter-hospital referral, and critical illnesses, including DOA, categorized as triage 1, or admitted to a ward or intensive care unit after the ED visit, were not influenced by the SARS epidemic. The number of patients with upper airway infections and suicide attempts from drug overdoses increased, but not statistically significantly. The number of patients with other diagnoses decreased progressively from early-to peak-epidemic stages, but returned to their earlier levels at the post-epidemic stage. Statistically significant decreases (p < 0.05) were noted in mean attendance at peakversus pre-and early-epidemic stages for patients with cardiovascular disease, inflammatory or functional bowel disease, endocrine disease, dizziness or vertigo, or trauma. Conclusion: The SARS outbreak did not eliminate the need of critically ill patients for advanced medical support. However, besides an overall decrease in patient numbers, the SARS epidemic markedly altered demographic information, clinical characteristics, and the use of medical services by adult patients in the ED of a SARS-dedicated hospital.

Significant reductions in the use of inpatient care (-35.2%), ambulatory care (-23.9%), dental care (-25.3%), and Chinese medicine (-5.8%) were noted at the peak of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan. 8 Our study demonstrates that the SARS epidemic had a great impact in reducing total ED patient attendances, with a decrease similar to that reported previously. 6 However, a marked decrease was also noted in the number of patients arriving at the ED by private car, and in the number in triage categories 2 or 3.",

            "text": "In addition, we extensively investigated the effect of the SARS epidemic on principal diagnoses among patients attending the ED during pre-, early-, peak-, late-, and post-epidemic stages. Anxiety about SARS acquisition prevented patients from attending the hospital or ED because of scientific uncertainty and because the infection is highly contagious and can cause critical illness and death. 6, 10, 11 However, even at the peak of the SARS outbreak, patients with true emergencies or needs for intensive care still arrived at the ED, either by ambulance or transferred from an ambulatory unit or another hospital. Indeed, our results show that the numbers of patients arriving at the ED by ambulance, in triage category 1, with critical illness, or requiring ward or ICU admission, were not influenced by the SARS epidemic. This indicates that emergency medical services remained imperative throughout the entire SARS epidemic, and suggests limited anxiety about the likelihood of acquiring SARS in a standard protective environment in a SARS-dedicated hospital among patients with critical illness who needed to visit the ED. 12, 13 We suggested that the SARS epidemic would reduce medical-service use in the various categories of ED disease, and that such reduced medical-service use would correlate highly with the overall decrease in patient numbers attending the ED. The numbers of patients with any of various principal ED diagnoses were expected to be reduced during the SARS epidemic, in line with the overall decrease in the number of ED attendees. Our study results showed that patients with upper respiratory tract infection, or those who attempted suicide with a drug overdose, increased in number during the peak-epidemic stage, but these increases were not statistically significant. Among other principal diagnoses, significant decreases (p < 0.05) in patient numbers were noted, in the peak-versus pre-and earlyepidemic stages, for cardiovascular disease, inflammatory or functional bowel disease, endocrine disease, dizziness or vertigo, and trauma. These results provide important information, including absolute patient numbers and relative proportions, about the quantitative effects of SARS on changes in individual, principal diagnoses in ED patients. Our results also support the evidence that the SARS epidemic placed tremendous psychologic stress on people, and caused about 50% of potential patients to not visit a hospital 10 or an ED 6 unless they highly suspected themselves to have SARS, or had an urgent or emergency condition.",

Huang, et al a hospital dedicated to SARS care, may explain the greater impact of the SARS epidemic on ED care (reduced by 43.7% in this study) than on overall ambulatory care (reduced by 23.9%) in Taiwan. 8 Because of the likelihood of a long-term fight against new or ongoing SARS outbreaks, the emergency physician workforce and ED medical resources should be flexible and easily adjusted, in line with the substantial results from this study. There are several limitations to this study. First, we could not predict the effects of a longer SARS epidemic, involving a greater number of patients, on the duration or amplitude of decreases in ED attendances, or on further changes in ED disease patterns. Second, spontaneous rather than SARS-induced changes in disease patterns may have occurred in our ED, although no significant differences in such patterns were noted between pre-and post-epidemic stages. Third, our study design was restricted to information obtained from a SARS-dedicated, tertiary medical center. The effects of the SARS outbreak on our study parameters in non-SARS-dedicated medical centers, community hospitals, and private hospitals or clinics, were not evaluated. Moreover, we did not investigate what impact a SARS outbreak would have on the closure of emergency services.",
