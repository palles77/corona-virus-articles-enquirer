Among the 3115 non-immigrant travellers with a definitive travel-related diagnosis, arthropod bite (n = 127 [4.1%]), giardiasis (n = 91 [2.9%]), malaria (n = 77 [2.5%]), latent tuberculosis (n = 73 [2.3%]), and strongyloidiasis (n = 66 [2.1%]) were the most common specific etiologic diagnoses.

The more affordable nature of air travel, the globalization of trade and commerce, the greater representation of developing-world immigrants within the Canadian population, and a trend toward \"voluntourism\" and ecotourism have all contributed to a greater number of Canadians crossing international borders than ever before. The stereotypical beachdestination vacationer is increasingly being replaced with off-the-beaten-path backpackers, new Canadian immigrants and their family members returning home to visit friends and relatives, last-minute business travellers, and researchers, missionaries, and volunteers heading to ever more exotic locales. This paradigm shift is supported by data from the World Tourism Organization and Statistics Canada. For example, in 2011, Canadians spent US$33 billion on international tourism, up from US$29.6 billion in 2010. 1 Along with traditional destinations such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, tropical and developingworld destinations, including Mexico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic, are among the top 10 foreign destinations chosen by Canadian travellers. 2 Travelling to the developing world necessarily puts travellers and migrants at risk for communicable infectious diseases, with 20%-70% of returned travellers suffering some sort of illness. [3] [4] [5] Although single-centre studies in other countries and multinational studies of travel-acquired illness have been conducted, a comprehensive multicentre comparison of the spectrum of illnesses acquired by a broad range of Canadian travellers returning from regions on all continents has been lacking. Understanding of the range and frequency of infectious diseases in Canadian travellers is based primarily on existing synthesized knowledge of travelacquired illness in other populations. Expert references such as the World Health Organization's International Travel and Health 6 and the so-called \"Yellow Book\" published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 7 as well as the Public Health Agency of Canada's Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel (CATMAT; www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/catmat -ccmtmv/index-eng.php), provide guidance to practitioners, yet data specifically focusing on Canadian travellers in support of recommendations from these sources are lacking. Furthermore, although many imported communicable diseases are designated as nationally notifiable to the Public Health Agency of Canada, 8 the quality of data accrued is hindered by delayed reporting and underreporting, which have led to \"an incomplete picture of the incidence of communicable diseases in Canada.\" 9 We synthesized Canada-specific surveillance data on ill returned travellers with the goal of informing provincial-and national-level public health policy and strategic initiatives to reduce the incidence of preventable infections, increase the efficiency of public health infrastructure, and improve the uptake of preventive pretravel care. In addition, this analysis provides accurate epidemiologic data about travel-associated infectious diseases in travellers returning to Canada, which are necessary to guide clinical decision-making by front-line Canadian practitioners.",

They are staffed by specialists in travel and tropical medicine and are typically secondary or tertiary points of care for patients, although immediate referral from the emergency departments attached to the respective parent hospitals is common. All of the centres provide post-travel services, which are billed under the provincial health plans. Collected data include each patient's demographic characteristics, detailed recent travel itinerary, all countries visited within the past 5 years, reason for travel, affected organ system, and whether the patient had a pretravel encounter with a health care provider. Final diagnoses are made by the attending physicians at each CanTravNet site, and each diagnosis is assigned a diagnostic code selected from a standardized list of more than 500 diagnostic entities, some of which are etiologic (e.g., Campylobacter) and others of which are syndromic (e.g., acute diarrhea). Syndromic codes are entered when an etiologic code cannot be assigned because of use of empiric therapy, self-limited disease, or inability to justify complete or sophisticated work-up as part of routine clinical practice. All CanTravNet sites contribute microbiologically confirmed data, where available, based on the best reference diagnostic tests (including serologic assays and polymerase chain reaction) available in Canada at the time. \"Probable\" diagnoses are restricted to patients with pathognomonic physical findings (e.g., tick eschar), clinical response to highly specific therapy, or classical presentation and exposure history with laboratory exclusion of other possible etiologies.",

Six possible reasons for most recent travel are available in GeoSentinel: immigration, including immigration by refugees; tourism; business; missionary, volunteer, research, or aid work; visiting friends and relatives; and \"other,\" which includes travel for education, military service, and \"medical tourism.\" Those whose reason for travel is listed as \"immigration\" include patients whose post-travel diagnosis is related to their emigration travel or long-term residence in the home country, rather than a particular isolated international trip. 11 Examples of diagnoses attributable to immigration-related travel are leprosy, tuberculosis, and certain chronic helminthic infections, such as hydatid disease or neurocysticercosis, as well as diseases imported by new immigrants to Canada. Travel to visit friends and relatives is defined as travel by an immigrant who is ethnically and/or racially distinct from the majority population in his or her current country of residence and who is returning to his or her homeland to visit friends and relatives. This type of travel also refers to travel by children of foreign-born parents (i.e., second-generation immigrants) who return to their parents' homeland to visit friends and relatives. The term \"visiting friends and relatives\" is typically applied to individuals travelling from a high-income country of current residence to a low-income country of origin. 12 \"Medical tourists\" are defined as those whose primary purpose of travel is to seek emergency or elective care and who, as a consequence of the travel, acquire an infectious complication secondary to the medical care received or become ill with an infectious or noninfectious disease while abroad.",

Chikungunya, which presents as a dengue-like illness, was rarely reported within this cohort, but it is an emerging arboviral infection of travellers to south Asia and the Indian Ocean islands, 14 and has emerged more recently in the Caribbean. Ill returned travellers with malaria were proportionately more likely to require inpatient management than those with other diagnoses. Of the 94 cases of malaria in ill returned travellers, 60% were caused by P. falciparum, which can lead to severe and fatal disease. Moreover, 8.5% of travellers with malaria had complicated or cerebral malaria, which underscores the potential severity of this highly preventable illness among travellers, as outlined in the Canadian recommendations for the management of falciparum malaria in Canada. 15 Lack of coverage may be an important reason why certain groups of travellers have fewer pretravel encounters. The relative risk of malaria among travellers is consistently highest in sub-Saharan Africa. 11, 14, 16 We have confirmed that sub-Saharan Africa is the source region for most malaria among ill returned Canadian travellers, accounting for almost 77% of cases in this cohort. Of the 22 cases of malaria in business travellers, all but one were acquired in sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast, dengue was more often associated with travel to the Caribbean and South East Asia. 17 Other potentially serious infections such as typhoid and paratyphoid fevers were more likely to be acquired in South Central Asia, a finding that supports previously published data. 10, 18, 19 Cosmopolitan and vaccine-preventable diseases were observed.

            "text": "Diarrheal illness is a common cause of morbidity among travellers. The most common and wellrepresented group of infectious illnesses among travellers are those borne by food and water. 30 These illnesses predominate in the developing world for one main reason: inadequate sewage and sanitation systems. Use of nonpotable water for drinking or for washing fruits and vegetables, as well as contamination of hands with fecal matter, places travellers at risk for common illnesses such as bacterial gastroenteritis and parasitic causes of diarrhea and dysentery. A gastrointestinal chief complaint predominated in this cohort of travellers, with a full 49.5% presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, chronic diarrhea, post-infectious IBS, acute unspecified diarrhea, acute bacterial diarrhea, and giardiasis were all among the top diagnoses reported. In particular, among tourists, missionaries, volunteers, researchers, aid workers, and other travellers, 4 to 6 of the top 10 diagnoses were related to gastrointestinal problems (Table 2) . Traveller's diarrhea, while usually self-limited, is known to trigger post-infectious IBS, a chronic and potentially debilitating condition, the median duration of which is approximately 2 to 3 years. 31 The diagnosis of post-infectious IBS is one of exclusion, requiring elimination of other etiologies by stool microbiology and possibly more costly diagnostic interventions such as imaging and colonoscopy. 32 Chronic diarrhea necessarily imposes a heavy burden on the Canadian health care system, given that approximately half of travellers to tropical and subtropical destinations experience infectious diarrhea while travelling, [33] [34] [35] 10% of whom likely go on to experience post-infectious IBS. 36 Limitations. This analysis had several limitations. First, the population analyzed represents only those ill returned travellers who presented to a CanTravNet clinic; as such, our conclusions may not extend to all ill returned travellers. However, the top countries of exposure for non-immigrant travellers paralleled the top countries visited by travelling Canadians in general, with Mexico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and China included among the top 10 destinations for both this cohort and the general Canadian population (International travel survey: Canadian residents 2000-2010 [custom extract supplied by Statistics Canada]). The top 3 source countries for new immigrants to Canada (the Philippines, China, and India) 37 were also represented among the top 4 countries of emigration for immigrant travellers in this cohort. Second, travellers with mild or self-limited illnesses or illnesses with very short or very long incubation periods may have sought care in different settings. For example, our study did not capture illnesses for which care was sought during travel. Similarly, ill travellers returning from destinations perceived to be low risk may be underrepresented in the CanTravNet database. Third, data on inpatient versus outpatient management may be influenced by regional variations in management guidelines. Fourth, our data do not permit estimation of incidence rates or destination-specific numeric risks for particular diseases. 10, 38 Finally, intersite variation in screening protocols for new immigrants and refugees may have led to over-or under-contributions of particular diagnoses from individual sites. Nearly half of all cases (48%) were contributed by Montreal sites, which may have introduced bias because of interprovince variation in travel patterns.",

            "text": "The impact and importance of travelacquired illness is considerable. At an individual level, it can lead to reduced work and school productivity, home convalescence, hospital admission, and potentially death, along with costs related to diagnostic tests and other medical visits that occur during the evaluation of such illnesses. At a population level, the potential for travellers to import public health threats, such as measles, sexually transmitted infections, and blood-borne and vector-borne diseases, is substantial. Accurate knowledge of the health problems faced by international travellers in different geographic destinations provides a robust evidence base for physicians to deliver effective preventive advice, immunizations, and prophylactic medications to travellers. This profile further informs post-travel diagnosis and therapy, as well as prioritization of pretravel intervention strategies for the most significant illnesses. The evidence presented here contributes to program-level decisions of the Public Health Agency of Canada related to provision of travel health information and prevention and control of infectious diseases. Specifically, it can inform decisions about allocation of resources to address certain at-risk populations such as those travelling to visit friends and relatives and travellers to specific destinations. It also contributes to the Agency's situational awareness and response to emerging and ongoing outbreaks and enhances the recommendation statements of the Agency's expert advisory committee, CATMAT. In this way, the Canada-specific surveillance data reported here should inform public health policy and strategic initiatives related to defining, monitoring, and preventing travelacquired illness in Canadians.",

Travel-related tuberculosis was a common diagnosis (n = 425), and the majority of cases (302 [71.1%]) were classified as latent, as indicated by a positive tuberculin skin test. The other types of tuberculosis documented among ill returned travellers were pulmonary (82 [19.3%]), extrapulmonary (31 [7.3%]), central nervous system or meningeal (7 [1.6%]), disseminated (2 [0.5%]), and multidrug resistant or extensively drug resistant (1 [0.2%]; acquired in Viet Nam). A total of 348 cases of travel-related blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections were diagnosed in this group of ill returned travellers. This total included 200 cases of acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infection and 97 cases of chronic hepatitis C virus infection; 185 (92.5%) of the hepatitis B cases and 89 (91.8%) of the hepatitis C cases were diagnosed in ill returned travellers who had travelled for immigration (Table 2). There were 15 cases of HIV infection, of which 10 (67%) occurred in those travelling for the purpose of immigration. Tuberculosis (both latent and active), hepatitis B virus infection, and hepatitis C virus infection were all diagnosed more frequently in those travelling for the purpose of immigration than in those travelling for other purposes (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Individuals travelling for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives (n = 500 [11.6% of those with known reason for travel]) were over-represented among those diagnosed with malaria and enteric fever, compared with other illnesses (for malaria 34/94 [36.2%] v. 466/4221 [11.0%]; for enteric fever, 17/36 [47.2%] v. 483/4279 [11.3%]) (both p < 0.001). For cases of malaria, there was also overrepresentation (compared with other illnesses) from business travellers (22/94 [23.4%] v. 337/4221 [8.0%]) and males (62/94 [66.0%] v. 1964/4269 [46.0%]) (both p < 0.001). Of the 22 cases of malaria in business travellers, 15 (68%) had received a pretravel consultation, yet only 3 took appropriate malaria prophylaxis. Of 7 cases of malaria diagnosed in ill returned pediatric travellers, 5 (71%) were caused by Plasmodium falciparum, and all occurred in children travelling for the purpose of immigration (n = 5) or to visit friends and relatives (n = 2). Travellers with malaria were also more likely to require inpatient management of their illness (41/94 [43.6%]) than were those with other travel-related diagnoses (170/3849 [4.4%]).",

In addition, this group had half the rate of pretravel encounters as other types of travellers. In 2010, people travelling to visit friends and relatives accounted for 17.4% of trips taken by Canadian travellers to overseas countries, with 1.83 million overnight visits; thus, the scale of travel to visit friends and relatives is substantial (International travel survey: Canadian residents 2000-2010 [custom extract supplied by Statistics Canada]).",
