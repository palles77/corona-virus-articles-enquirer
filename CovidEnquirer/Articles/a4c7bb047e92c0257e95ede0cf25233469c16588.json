Several factors, such as nutrition of lactating and dry cows, vaccinations of lactating and dry cows, length of dry periods, cleanliness of the calving environment and disease status of the dams, will ultimately affect disease resistance and health of replacements. It is important to note, however, that cows that are overfed tend to have difficulty calving because of being excessively over conditioned. Cows that are underfed, which results in mineral or vitamin deficiencies or lack of body condition, may produce inferior and low-volume colostrum. They also may experience difficulty calving. Protein deficiency in cows during the dry period may lead to low birth weights, low metabolic rates and poor vigor of calves, resulting in poor survivability. Some research also indicates that inadequate protein and energy nutrition of the dam results in poor absorption of immunoglobulins from colostrum by the calf. Cows that lose condition during the dry period are also at greater risk of experiencing calving difficulty. Calves that experience difficult births require more time before being able to stand, experience an increase in the time to voluntary suckling and have a decreased ability to absorb immunoglobulins. All these problems result in decreased transfer of passive immunity from the dam to the calf and increased risk of disease in calves. As the degree of calving difficulty increases, the risk of mortality for calves increases. Proper nutrition of dairy cows during lactation and the dry period will help decrease disease risks for replacements.",

Some farming communities apply more direct video surveillance mechanism to monitor milking herd to prevent any possible disruption in milk production by taking care of early animal health symptoms and unexpected animal behaviours. Intelligent processing of video stream, combined with in-situ visual observations by a farmer could provide a better management culture in replacement management.

This issue has become ever more important in today's world, where market accessibility for a local producer of milk and dairy products, could be global. Bigger market access and business proposition comes with a significantly higher level of responsibility. Zero tolerance attitudes towards animal and food Biosecurity are key to greater market access and business sustainability. Greater awareness is needed to achieve a standard biosecurity management in cattle industries. Informed decision on planned vaccinations of the dams will also impact disease resistance of dairy replacements and a better preventive management. Proper vaccination of the dairy herd will increase the concentration of antibodies (immunoglobulins specific for diseases) in colostrum. Dams may be vaccinated during the dry period against pathogens that are common causes of diarrhea in calves, such as Escherichia coli, rotavirus and coronavirus. Vaccination of the dams increases the concentration of antibodies against these pathogens in colostrum, thus providing increased protection for calves, resulting in decreased incidence or duration of diarrhea. Vaccination of the dams during the dry period is more effective for prevention of disease in calves than vaccination of calves at an early age. The immune system of neonatal calves is unable to respond quickly to a vaccination or an infection because the immune system of the newborn is immature at birth. Both numbers and effectiveness of antibody-producing cells are lower in calves at birth than in adult cattle. Therefore, it is important for calves to obtain antibodies against common diseases of calves by consumption of colostrum rather than from an attempt to vaccinate calves at an early age. Vaccination of the dams against pneumonia may also help to decrease the incidence or severity of this disease in replacements.",

A dry period that is too short, i.e. less than 6 weeks, may not provide enough time for involution of the mammary gland and preparation for the next lactation. Cows with shortened dry periods produce small quantities of colostrum that may also have low concentrations of immunoglobulins. It is important for health of replacements, therefore, that cows have at least a 6-week dry period for production of high-quality colostrum.",

Wet, sloppy stalls provide a perfect environment for growth of bacteria. Calving on a grass lot may be the best alternative when the climate is dry and mild. If a maternity barn is used, it is important to clean stalls thoroughly between calvings to prevent transfer of disease. Maternity stalls should only be used for calving and never for housing sick cows. Maternity pens and sick pens should be kept in separate facilities in order to prevent transfer of disease to highly vulnerable neonates and periparturient dairy cows. It is also important for the cows to be as clean as possible at calving in order to prevent calves from contracting disease organisms when suckling or attempting to suckle their dams. Preferably, calves should be separated from dams prior to suckling in order to prevent the calf from ingesting pathogens present on the legs, belly, flanks or udder of the cow as the calf attempts to nurse. Separating the calf from the dam and feeding colostrum by bottle also ensures adequate intake of colostrum for transfer of passive immunity from the dam.",

Diseases such as Johne's disease, milk fever (Hypocalcaemia) close to calving, bovine viral diarrhea (BVD), and bovine leucosis virus (BLV) may be passed in utero or through colostrum. Calves should only be fed colostrum from cows known to be free of these diseases. It is important, therefore, to maintain a supply of frozen, high-quality colostrum from cows free of such diseases. Today's cost could be tomorrow's gain, so conservativeness towards deploying new technologies in replacement management could be addressed by community based farming, to try new practice, to tackle ever growing biosecurity related threats in dairy industries.",

            "text": "Along with economic losses from high mortality rates as a result of lack of colostrum consumption, there are also increased costs associated with increased medication and poor feed efficiency. Transfer of passive immunity (absorption of immunoglobulins from colostrum) can be determined using commercial kits that measure immunoglobulins in the blood. For adequate protection of calves, blood immunoglobulin concentrations should be at least 10 mg ml \u00c01 . Serum protein concentrations in calves are also highly correlated with the concentration of immunoglobulins in blood and can be used to determine adequate transfer of passive immunity. A hand-held refractometer can be used to measure serum protein; levels greater than 5.0 g 100 ml \u00c01 by 24 h of age indicate adequate consumption of colostrum. The similar technology could be used to measure 'Specific Gravity of Urine' and 'Refractive Index of serum', as researchers are aiming to combine these factors for better diagnosis. The use of colostrum substitutes and replacers may help improve disease resistance in calves when high-quality colostrum is not available. It's also important to have a better feeding management plan for the dry cows 2 weeks before the calving, as this effects the amount of calcium available to replace blood calcium, and how efficiently body can utilize the available calcium at a very critical period. The most prevalent health problem of calves on most farms in the United States is diarrhea. Organisms such as Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus and coronavirus that cause diarrhea will not respond to antibiotic treatment. For cryptosporidiosis, the only means of prevention is sanitation, which includes controlling flies. For rotavirus and coronavirus, the most effective prevention is vaccination of the dam to increase antibodies in the colostrum against these organisms. Other organisms, such as E. coli and Salmonella sp., may be resistant to many of the commonly used antibiotics. Producers often give antibiotics to calves during episodes of diarrhea in order to prevent secondary infections; however, this practice often does more damage than good, killing beneficial gut microflora and damaging the gut lining. The first step in caring for calves with diarrhea is to provide fluids for hydration and electrolytes for mineral loss, while continuing to provide milk for protein and energy. An electrolyte solution can be fed from 20 min to 2 h after each feeding of milk or milk replacer until feces return to normal. Secondly, the organism causing diarrhea should be identified to determine whether antibiotic treatment is needed.",

Research has shown that calves raised in individual hutches (plastic, fiberglass or wooden structures providing individual housing) perform very well and have fewer health problems, especially pneumonia, than calves raised in closed buildings. Open-front housing for older heifers should also help prevent pneumonia. Adequate, draught-free ventilation is important for prevention of pneumonia. Hutches, pastures and open-front housing for replacements provide optimal ventilation. In addition, hutches can be moved from location to location, giving producers the opportunity easily to remove old bedding and to break disease cycles. No matter what type of housing is used for replacements, cleanliness, dry bedding and adequate ventilation are essential to decrease incidence of disease.",

In other areas, housing calves in groups and using mob-feeders is an efficient method of rearing calves during the liquid feeding phase. After weaning, calves should be housed in small groups of 10 or fewer until they have successfully made the transition from liquid feed to dry feed and the transition from individual housing to competing for food. The grouping could be done better by multi-sensory historical recording of individual cow behavioural patterns, body temperature, provenance of any previous disease records, long term eating patterns from the young age, and any obvious known symptoms at the time of the grouping. Additionally, by housing in small groups (rather than mixing large groups of animals at one time), producers can limit the exposure of calves to disease organisms and match calves more closely by size. As calves age, they can be housed in increasingly larger groups; however, animals should be grouped so there is not more than 50 kg difference in size of animals up to 6 months and not more than 90 kg difference in size for older animals.",

            "text": "Biosecurity is an outcome of a human systemso people are at its core. All dairy producers must actively institute biosecurity measures to prevent introduction of disease into the herd and to minimize spread of disease within the herd. For replacements, it is extremely important to prevent exposure of younger animals to older animals that may have Johne's disease. Exposure is not limited merely to animal-to-animal contact, but also includes articles of transmission, such as manure on hands, clothing and boots of workers, manure from older animals on equipment for feeding and handling replacements, or water that has been contaminated by older animals. In addition, flies can transfer diseases from older to younger animals. Producers must determine whether to have a closed herd or to allow introduction of new animals to the farm. If new animals are brought to a farm, the producer should work closely with a veterinary surgeon to determine which vaccinations animals should receive prior to coming to the farm. Once new animals arrive on the farm, or animals return to the farm from contract-growers or exhibitions, they should be quarantined for at least 30 days. This will allow time to determine if the new animals are likely to become ill and to allow the new animals to be exposed more slowly to any disease organisms currently on the farm. Airborne disease spread in cattle farming is rear but when it happens, severity of damage is significantly higher. Prions, the proteins that cause mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disorder could be spread through the air, rather than just through contaminated food, as recent studies have reported. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a severe, highly contagious viral disease of cattle and swine, primarily get spread under favourable weather conditions. The disease may be spread considerable distances by over a route, within a short time period, directed by wind speed, air pressure and temperature. Given the fact that airborne spread is probably the one of the most serious issue in animal biosecurity management, a predictive meteorological service for national level biosecurity risk pathway analysis is essential, for prevention of large-scale livestock disease control. In recent time researchers have reported interesting results and applications of a data driven predictive model to track a probable route of an airborne disease, an alerting system to provide better biosecurity decision support for efficient management of cattle health.",
