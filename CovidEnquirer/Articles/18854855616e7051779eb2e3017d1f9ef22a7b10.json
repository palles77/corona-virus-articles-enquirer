The SARS tragedy in 2003 greatly afflicted China and revealed the shortcomings of China's infectious disease prevention system, propelling the Chinese Government to accelerate reforms. 11 The model of infectious diseases prevention and control in China was changed significantly from non-collaborative prevention and control to joint, multisectorial, integrated prevention and control strategies. 12 Moreover, to comprehensively improve infectious disease prevention and control, major special national science and technology projects on prevention and control were started in China at the end of 2008. 13 Understanding the epidemiological distribution of infectious diseases is the most important task for controlling infectious diseases. 5 However, the specific geographic patterns and temporal trends of major infectious diseases in the post-SARS era have been researched rarely. In this study, we aimed to assess specific incidence and mortality trends of 45 notifiable infectious diseases from 2004 to 2013 in China and to investigate the overall effectiveness of current prevention and control strategies.",

However, the model of infectious disease prevention and control has changed significantly since 2003, when the great tragedy of the SARS outbreak revealed the shortcomings of China's infectious disease prevention system and propelled the Chinese Government to accelerate reforms. Based on literature searches in PubMed after the 2003 SARS outbreak, no complete, systematic, long-term, and comprehensive description of infectious disease characteristics and trends has been made available.",

The incidence and case-fatality ratio for each infectious disease were standardised from 0 to 1 according to percentile rank, and represented by the colour scale (from 0 to 1; where 1 is the highest rate and 0 is the lowest rate). HFMD=hand, foot, and mouth disease. AD=amoebic dysentery. AHC=acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis. BD=bacterial dysentery. ECM=epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis. NT=neonatal tetanus. OID=infectious diarrhoeal diseases other than cholera, bacterial dysentery, amoebic dysentery, typhoid, and paratyphoid. SARS=severe acute respiratory syndrome. Globally, the incidence of the three main infectious diseases-hand, foot, and mouth disease, hepatitis B, and tuberculosis-varies greatly between countries. Large outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease are not common in the USA, but in some countries in Asia, outbreaks are large and frequent. 19 In eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, people with tuberculosis are mainly refugees, with a latent prevalence of 55%. 20 Geographically, the prevalence of hepatitis B differs greatly. In China, the proportion of HBsAg carriers was 7\u00b718% in 2006, which is significantly higher than the proportion of carriers in countries in Europe and North America. 21 In China, the high overall yearly incidence and mortality of the 45 infectious diseases could be related to high incidence and mortality in provinces near the remote Chinese border, such as Yunnan and Xinjiang. In these regions, a combination of factors can favour development and spread of infectious diseases-eg, different customs within the multiethnic population, limited access to health care, less efficient public health programmes and infrastructure, environmental degradation, and poverty. Furthermore, the reported yearly incidence, which is affected by detection levels and screening intensity, could vary between diseases and geographical areas.",

            "text": "In this study, significant seasonal features were noted for several infectious diseases, including acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, rubella, influenza A H1N1, and dengue. Seasonal features of infectious diseases are useful resources for inferring temporal and spatiotemporal transmission parameters, to better understand and predict the spread of disease. 22 However, the seasonality of infectious diseases could be affected by geographical differences; our results indicated that there were two epidemic peaks of seasonal influenza, whereas this infectious disease was reported to have a dual seasonal pattern between southern and northern China. 23 Our findings indicated that overall yearly incidence of the 45 infectious diseases was high among male individuals and children, and overall yearly mortality was high for male individuals, children, and elderly people. Thus, specific strategies and measures should target these three populations. More than 95% of cases of childhood infectious disease are prevented by vaccines. 24 However, low perceptivity of disease risk by individuals can lead to reduced participation in vaccination programmes. 24 Vaccination programmes should strengthen society's understanding of infection and improve compliance with vaccination. A high incidence of infectious diseases in elderly people would be a great threat to public health and society in China, where 178 million people are older than 60 years, and this number is estimated to increase to approximately 423 million by 2050. 25 The incidence and case-fatality ratios of infectious diseases among people older than 60 years are roughly three times the current average. In recent decades, the overall incidence and mortality of infectious diseases have shown a striking decline in China. 3 This sharp fall can be attributed to effective and large-scale public health interventions and large population-based vaccination programmes. However, the notable decreasing tendency of overall incidence was reversed in the past few years, with a gradual upward trend reported, 3 which we have confirmed in our study of 45 infectious diseases. Several factors could account for this increasing trend. First, the timeliness of reporting has improved, with fewer missing reports, which is attributable to great technological progress in laboratory detection and case identification. Moreover, diagnosis of infectious diseases has improved gradually in recent decades. In particular, use of PCR rapid diagnosis technologies has become widespread in hospitals at all levels. An improvement in diagnostic levels for infections would affect incidence. 26 Second, because of increasing antimicrobial resistance, augmented human connectivity, and changeable human behaviour, the threat of infection continues to rise. 2 In China, more than 10% of the population has moved from poor rural areas to urban centres in search of better economic opportunities, which promotes transmission of infectious diseases. 3 Furthermore, imported and emerging infectious diseases are correlated with socioeconomic, environmental, and ecological factors. 5 Specific strategies and measures should be designed to counteract increasing trends in hydatid disease, hepatitis C, HIV infection, syphilis, brucellosis, schistosomiasis, hepatitis E, other infectious diarrhoeal diseases, mumps, and leprosy-eg, early surveillance and warning with enhanced screening, massive vector control, expansion of vaccine immunisation programmes, and reduction or exemption of treatment costs for infectious diseases. However, some discrepancies with previous reports in trends of infectious diseases (eg, schistosomiasis) need to be studied specifically in the future. 27 Although the overall yearly incidence of infectious diseases showed an increasing trend in China from 2004, fortunately, this trend changed after 2009. Furthermore, trends in incidence for 20 of 45 infectious diseases have decreased since 2004. After the 2003 SARS epidemic, the Chinese Government strengthened joint multisectoral cooperation and increased investments in infectious disease prevention and control. In particular, the major special national science and technology project on preventing and controlling infectious diseases began in China at the end of 2008, 13 with a total investment of about US$2\u00b725 billion. The primary infectious diseases-including hepatitis B, tuberculosis, and HIV infection-have been contained effectively in a large-scale demonstration area (located in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Shandong, Beijing, Gansu, Sichuan, Henan, Xinjiang, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guangxi provinces), where the project has made improvements in perfecting, enhancing, and expanding screening, augmenting the vaccine immunisation programme, and reducing or exempting treatment costs for infectious diseases. 21, 28, 29 In the past several decades, China has implemented various strategies to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Some strategies have been proven effective, which could also serve as a model for other developing countries. These strategies include improvements in the water supply and sanitation, improvements in the safety of blood collection, massive vector control, expanding the vaccine immunisation programme, and early surveillance and warning with enhanced screening.",

Second, incidence could also be underestimated because of ascertainment bias by self-selection, in which individuals with a specific infectious disease are more likely to avoid screening than are people without that infection. Third, overall yearly incidence of the 45 infectious diseases was affected by the constituent incidence of each infectious disease in each province; thus, overall incidence should be considered with reference to each infectious disease and province. Moreover, potential bias could affect incidence and mortality reporting because of variations in diagnostic standards, technical levels, and experimental conditions in different departments or institutions.",

We have described the epidemiological features of and changes in 45 infectious diseases (expanded from a previous report of 18 infectious diseases) during the longest period studied in post-SARS China. Moreover, although the overall incidence of infectious diseases was increasing, this trend was inflected after 2009, and 20 of 45 infectious diseases showed decreasing trends since 2004. Furthermore, incidence and mortality have varied substantially in the post-SARS era. Hand, foot, and mouth disease, hepatitis B, and tuberculosis have the highest yearly incidence, and hydatid disease, hepatitis C, and syphilis show the fastest increases. Thus, personalised and precise strategies for prevention and control of these diseases should be applied for specific populations, with an emphasis on children, elderly people, male individuals, and people living in specific regions.",
