Osmotic diarrhea occurs with malabsorptive disorders where nutrients are maldigested or malabsorbed, remain within the intestinal lumen, and osmotically attract water. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is an example of an osmotic diarrheal disorder. Retention of nutrients can lead to alterations in intestinal microflora and fermentation of carbohydrates, further increasing numbers of osmotically active particles. The fecal water output in osmotic diarrhea is directly related to fecal output of the solute or solutes that are exerting an osmotic gradient across intestinal mucosa. Electrolyte absorption is unaffected by these osmotically active substances, and fecal water typically contains very little unabsorbed sodium or potassium. 2 This is the basis for the calculation of the \"fecal osmotic gap.\" In this calculation, the difference between luminal osmolality (equal to body fluid osmolality, approximately 290 mOsm/kg, because the colon cannot maintain an osmotic gradient against plasma) and osmolality of luminal contents contributed by fecal electrolytes is estimated. The contribution of fecal electrolytes is calculated as twice the sum of sodium and potassium ions to account for the anions that accompany these cations. A fecal osmotic gap greater than 50 mOsm/kg suggests osmotic diarrhea. 2 One of the major hallmarks of osmotic diarrhea is that diarrhea resolves when the patient stops ingesting the poorly absorbable solute.",

The most common cause of secretory diarrhea in dogs and cats are abnormal mediators resulting in changes in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), calcium, and/or protein kinases, which in turn cause a decrease in neutral sodium chloride absorption or an increase in chloride secretion. 3 Such mediators include endogenous enteric hormones or neuropeptides, inflammatory cell products, bacterial enterotoxins, laxatives, fatty acids, and bile acids (see Chapters 1 and 57 for more detail). Secretory diarrhea has two important distinguishing features; first, fecal osmolality can be accounted for by sodium, potassium, and their accompanying anions, and thus the osmotic gap is small; and second, the diarrhea usually persists despite fasting because the diarrhea is caused by abnormalities in ion transport that have nothing to do with food.

It is equally important to fully characterize the nature of diarrhea and appearance of feces (Table  11-1) . For dogs with a history of tenesmus, it is pivotal to determine whether signs are secondary to colitis or to a discrete mass or polyp in the colorectal region. The latter is often associated with a change in the appearance of the stool (\"ribbon-like,\" \"pencil-thin\") in the intestinal blood loss).

In addition, panhypoproteinemia and hypocholesterolemia can be recognized in animals with a proteinlosing enteropathy from intestinal lymphangiectasia or other infiltrative bowel disorders. Electrolyte changes as a consequence of diarrhea should be carefully scrutinized, and corrected whenever warranted. Hyperkalemia and hyponatremia are typical electrolyte alterations commonly found in Addisonian dogs; however, these electrolyte changes have been documented in dogs with whipworm infestations and other enteropathies in the absence of Addison disease (pseudo-Addison disease). In addition, dogs with atypical Addison disease can manifest diarrhea in the absence of electrolyte changes. Elevated hepatic enzyme values should be interpreted cautiously in patients with gastrointestinal disease because drainage of bacteria or endotoxin via the portal circulation can precipitate a reactive hepatopathy with elevations of hepatocellular leakage enzymes.

The integrity of the barrier function of the GI tract has been evaluated by permeability testing in several species, and many different marker molecules, including 51 chromium-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetate 15 ( 51 Cr-EDTA), polyethylene glycols, and mono-and disaccharides have been evaluated. 16 Mannitol and lactulose are nonmetabolizable, hydrophilic, and lipophobic, with negligible affinity for the monosaccharide transport system, and are absorbed passively by nonmediated means. Recovery in urine is almost total and renal clearance is high. The simultaneous use of two allows a differential estimation of transcellular pathways through small-size channels, and paracellular pathways through large-size channels (tight junctions). Furthermore, the simultaneous use of these two sugars and the calculation of the ratio of the sugars makes the test independent of the degree of completion of the urine collection. Finally, it is known that intestinal permeability to mannitol is close to that of rhamnose and permeability to lactulose is similar to that of 51 Cr-EDTA. 17 GI permeability and mucosal function testing is used predominantly in the research arena, and not used very often in routine clinical practice.",

If left untreated, the final outcome of PLE is panhypoproteinemia with decreased intravascular oncotic pressure and the development of abdominal and pleural effusion, peripheral edema, and death. Protein-losing enteropathy is uncommon in cats, and most cats with PLE are diagnosed with intestinal lymphoma or severe IBD. Serum albumin and total protein should be carefully evaluated in all patients with a history of weight loss, anorexia, vomiting, or diarrhea. Although PLE is typically associated with panhypoproteinemia, the absence of hypoglobulinemia does not preclude a diagnosis of PLE because chronic antigenic stimulation could increase the serum globulin concentration into the \"normal\" reference range. Additional abnormalities found on the serum biochemistry profile in association with PLE include hypocholesterolemia (secondary to malabsorption) and hypocalcemia.

Short-chain fatty acids may lower the colonic luminal pH, impeding the growth of pathogens. 23 The health benefits derived from dietary supplementation of prebiotics have yet to be fully recognized in dogs and cats with chronic diarrhea, although prebiotic administration has been shown to decrease the concentrations of fecal ammonia and amines and increased the numbers of bifidobacteria in dog feces. 24 Fish oil is reported to be beneficial in ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease patients, 25 but the results are controversial.

These home-cooked diets should be made up by a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that the diets are complete and balanced. Dogs with concurrent IBD and lymphangiectasia are more challenging to manage from a dietary perspective because these animals need a novel, select protein source diet that is also markedly fat restricted and virtually no commercial diet fits these criteria. An alternative to consider is the use of hypoallergenic diets containing hydrolyzed protein sources and moderate amounts of dietary fat. Failure to respond favorably to these diets warrants a home-cooked diet that is more fat-restricted and contains a novel, select protein source. Administration of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) to enhance the caloric density of the diet is controversial because of unpleasant taste and potential for inducing diarrhea.

The dosage and duration of therapy is based on severity and duration of clinical signs, severity and type of inflammation, clinical response, and tolerance to the drug. The initial dosage of prednisone for therapy of IBD in dogs is 1 to 2 mg/kg q12h, not to exceed a total dose of 50 mg q12h. Cats are typically administered prednisolone, and the drug is started at a dose of 5 mg per cat q12h. The drug is gradually tapered over a 6-to 10-week period once clinical remission is attained. Combination therapy with dietary therapy, azathioprine, or metronidazole is undertaken with the goal of attempting to reduce the dose of prednisone.

It has been demonstrated that colitis in both humans and mice is associated with increased levels of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12p70, and IL-23. 31, 32 Thus a proper selection of probiotic strains for the treatment of IBD is crucial and should be based on the estimation of their capacity to induce antiinflammatory pattern of cytokines (IL-10 high , TGF-\u03b2 high , IL-12p70 low , IL-23 low , TNF-\u03b1 low ). Apart from immunomodulatory effects, probiotics have a protective effect on the normal microflora of the human gut by their antimicrobial activities directed toward intestinal pathogens. 33 Probiotics also have been used to facilitate eradication of intestinal parasites. A recent study documented the ability of the probiotic organism Enterococcus faecium SF68 (Forta-Flora, Nestle-Purina, St. Louis, MO) to antagonize Giardia intestinalis infection in mice. 34 Oral feeding of E. faecium strain SF68 starting 7 days before inoculation with Giardia trophozoites significantly increased production of specific anti-Giardia intestinal immunoglobulin (Ig) A and blood IgG. This humoral response was mirrored at the cellular level by an increased percentage of CD4(+) T cells in Peyer patches and spleens of SF68-fed mice. Improvement of specific immune responses in probiotic-fed mice was associated with a diminution in the number of active trophozoites in small intestine as well as decreased shedding of fecal Giardia antigens (GSA65 protein). A recent study evaluating efficacy of E. faecium SF68 in 20 adult dogs with chronic naturally acquired giardiasis failed to affect cyst shedding or antigen content and did not alter innate or adaptive immune responses. 35 Additional studies are warranted in dogs and cats to further assess the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics and to evaluate their safety. The latter issue is particularly important given the recent finding of increased intestinal adhesion of Campylobacter jejuni in an in vitro model of canine intestinal mucus following incubation with E. faecium. 36 It should be noted that this E. faecium strain is different from the E. faecium SF68 alternate-day administration, whereas cats should receive 0.3 mg/kg q48h. The most significant side effect of azathioprine is bone marrow suppression, particularly in cats. Other side effects include anorexia, pancreatitis, and hepatic dysfunction.",
