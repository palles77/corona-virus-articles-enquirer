            "text": "Protein therapeutics are the fastest-growing class of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to treat the most difficult-to-manage human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurologic disorders. 1, 2 However, the current regimen is mainly restricted to extracellular targets, due to the inability of proteins to enter cells. Exosomes, natural nanovesicles circulating in the human body, possess intrinsic ability to deliver various protein cargoes into recipient cells, thus representing an untapped source of effective delivery carrier toward intracellular targets. The concept of using exosomes for protein delivery has been attempted, but remains to be fully exploited. [3] [4] [5] [6] Exosomes are lipid bilayer-enclosed extracellular vesicles that transport proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids between cells. [7] [8] [9] In mammals, exosomes are actively released by almost all types of cells, exist in body fluids, and circulate in the blood. [10] [11] [12] Exosomes are recognized and endocytosed by tissue cells via specific interactions between surfacemembrane proteins, where after they deliver their molecular cargo. [13] [14] [15] Therefore, they function in cell-cell communication and play important roles in immunodefense, pathogen spread, inflammation, tumor metastasis, and tissue repair. 11, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Exosomes are designed by nature to deliver a large and specific cargo of functional biomolecules, a feature that is guiding the development of exosome-based vehicles for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. [25] [26] [27] These studies, however, are impacted by gaps in our knowledge of exosome biogenesis and in approaches to engineer exosomes with a molecular cargo that enhances their uptake by target cells.",

            "text": "In this study, we describe a pseudotyping approach to load exosomal membranes with reporter and targeting proteins. Pseudotyping is often used in the production of recombinant viruses and involves packaging the genetic components of the virus (DNA or RNA) with envelope proteins derived from a different virus. [28] [29] [30] This method allows one to select viral envelope proteins to alter host tropism, which may result in enhanced infection of the recombinant virus. 31, 32 The G glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) is frequently used for viral pseudotyping, owing to its broad tropism and high efficacy in transduction, and in fact most of the retroviruses approved for clinical trials are pseudotyped with VSVG. [33] [34] [35] Mechanistically, VSVG is incorporated into the viral envelope during the budding of microdomains at the plasma membrane, the same domains involved in the formation of endosomes and exosomes. 36 This connection led us to propose the possibility of engineering exosomes with specific membrane-bound proteins by expressing gene-encoding VSVG fusion proteins in their mother cells. Taking advantage of the modular structure and well-defined membrane topology of VSVG, we engineered VSVG to achieve the following two biological objectives: 1) effective protein loading via terminal tagging of VSVG and 2) enhanced exosome uptake via VSVG pseudotyping. By generating exosomes that harbor a VSVG fusion with a protein that recognizes a surface biomarker on a target cell, it should be possible to generate exosomes repurposed as vehicles for intracellular delivery of functional fluorescent proteins and antibodies to diseased cells for high-contrast imaging and therapy, respectively.",

Key to the success of our pseudotyping approach was to control the topology of VSVG on the exosome membrane. We hypothesized that the preferred topology of VSVG on the exosome would be one where the VSVG protein is retained in the membrane by the interaction of its hydrophobic tail with the bilayer membrane. This anchoring strategy would position the ectodomain of fVSVG to the outer surface of the exosome for pseudotyping ( Figure 1A and D). Moreover, by fusing targeting molecules to fVSVG, one could maximize interactions of the exosome with surface antigens on the plasma membrane of a target cell. Alternatively, by swapping the ectodomain with a cell-trophic peptide or a disease-targeting antibody, one could target the exosome to a specific tissue or tumor. 39 This latter approach could be further refined for in vivo targeted therapy and imaging of tumors or diseased tissue by fusing an engineered antibody or a near-infrared fluorescent protein.",

To ensure these fusion proteins were properly anchored with the correct topography on exosomal membranes, the SP sequences and the transmembrane helix of fVSVG were left intact in all fusion proteins ( Figure 1B ). This strategy would limit the synthesis of VSVG to the surface of the rough ER, with the SP sequence guiding the insertion of the ectodomain into the ER lumen ( Figure 1C ).

Previous studies have shown that the SP sequence is removed and the remaining VSVG molecules concentrate in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains of the plasma membrane. 40, 41 Exosomes are believed to form these domains in two sequential inward-budding processes: the first generates an endosome, while the second leads to the formation of multiple-vesicle bodies that eventually release individual exosomes into the extracellular space ( Figure 1C ). 7 VSVG introduces functional fluorescent proteins to presecreted exosomes Next, we examined if the proteins we appended to VSVG were functional and correctly positioned on the exosomal membrane. First, we generated two fusion proteins tagged with GFP or RFP at the C-terminus of VSVG. Cultured HEK293 cells were transfected with these constructs, and their intracellular localization expression was recorded for up to 7 days by fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of these image data shows accumulations of fluorescent proteins at plasma membranes of HEK293 cells within 2 days of the transfection (Figure 2A and E) . The membrane localization of these fluorescent proteins was evident when comparing fluorescence signals with the phase contrast in merged images ( Figure 2B and F). By day 3, the fluorescence signal of the fusion protein was found at other intracellular regions of the cell ( Figure 2C and G). The punctate intracellular fluorescence was consistent with that expected for endocytic structures ( Figure 2D and H). We argue the intracellular Next, we conducted imaging studies to verify the fluorescence of VSVG fusion expressed in HEK293 cells colocalized to endocytic compartments by comparing distributions of VSVG fluorescence with validated fluorescent markers of the endosome. These studies, conducted in cells cotransfected with fVSVG-RFP (red) and an endosome marker, Rab5A-GFP (green), showed considerable overlap of the two fluorescent signals that was immediately apparent by the large number of yellow puncta in overlaid images ( Figure 2I -K) and provide compelling evidence that fluorescent fVSVG fusion protein localizes to endosomes.",

These imaging studies conformed with initial findings on the early appearance of RFP at the plasma membrane ( Figure 4A , upper panel, days 1 and 2) and late participation of fVSVG-RFP in intracellular granules, tentatively assigned as exosomes ( Figure 4A , upper panel, days 4 and 6). Analysis of the corresponding images of XPack-GFP showed a similar temporal pattern ( Figure 4A , lower panel), which would suggest that fVSVG and XPack share a common pathway in exosome biogenesis. After cotransfection, analysis of fluorescence images of these two independent fluorescent tracers revealed extensive colocalization ( Figure 4B ), indicating they shared similar intracellular distribution in HEK293 cells. These findings support our hypothesis that VSVG is preferentially recruited into exosomes via the endocytic pathway.",

If the pseudotyped exosomes are released from transfected cells, high levels of luciferase activities could be expected from the conditioned medium.

The difference in the activity of the transfected luciferase fusion proteins for these two reporters could arise from the limited availability of the coelenterazine substrate, since the Gluc-mVSVG is on the outer surface of the exosome, and hence it is more accessible to the substrate. Nevertheless, these results suggest fVSVG/mVSVG carry their appended luciferase onto exosomes in an active form, and in both cases the exosomes are released into the extracellular space.",

In this study, we have described a new pseudotyping approach to engineer exosomes as vehicles for the intracellular delivery of protein cargo, imparted by enhancing their intrinsic ability to deliver bioactive cargo to recipient cells. 7, 44 Our studies build on well-established principles underlying VSVG pseudotyping, which has been used to produce recombinant viruses (murine retroviruses and HIV1) and to enhance the efficiency of gene delivery. 31, 32 In these early studies, VSVG and viral structure proteins were coexpressed and incorporated into the viral envelope to form infectious recombinant viruses, rather than exosomes. Maguire et al 45 used VSVG to pseudotype extracellular vesicles and found that adeno-associated virus coupled with these pseudotyped vesicles gained enhanced ability of gene delivery, implicating extracellular vesicles with viral infection. In later studies, Marsac et al 46 and Kuate et al 47 used VSVG to boost antibody production against viral peptides, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CV) S protein and an HIV-Gag epitope. In both cases, both VSVG and a viral protein (SARS-CV-S protein or HIV-Gag) were included as components of the exosome-based vaccination material. Notably, Mangeot et al 6 were able to use VSVG alone to produce VSVG-induced nanovesicles, termed \"gesicles\", for protein transfer into human cells, avoiding viral delivery totally. Although those studies pointed to the possibility of a convergent mechanism via vesicle pseudotyping, the exact molecular mechanisms and final destination of VSVG in living mammalian cells remain elusive. Importantly, whether the VSVG molecule has an intrinsic ability to target exosomes and thus can be particularly used for exosome engineering remains to be tested.",

This strategy can be further developed to deliver exosomes to defined cell types simply by appending VSVG with an enzyme that could form the basis of a replacement therapy for a hereditary disease, or cell-recognizing peptides for targeting, or engineered therapeutic antibodies that target specific suppressors of cytotoxic T cells for cancer therapy. 53 Third, we have demonstrated that exosomes pseudotyped with VSVG are internalized by a diverse collection of human and murine cells, including two human iPS cell lines. This targeting and the subsequent internalization of exosomes by recipient cells require the ectodomain. Fourth, the role of the VSVG ectodomain for protein loading and delivery is multifaceted. The native VSVG ectodomain is dispensable for protein loading, and thus deletion of the ectodomain can make room for other polypeptide loading. For example, RFP can replace the ectodomain, and chimeric protein can be loaded onto exosomes. Because the ectodomain serves as an important docking molecule for exosome loading, it can be potentially replaced with other cell-tropic peptides; therefore, this strategy can be used for engineering targeted exosomes for delivery.",

The large N-terminal ectodomain (black line) with a short stem region (green line) is situated at the outer surface of the plasma membrane or the luminal side of the endosome. Those sequences are followed by a transmembrane helix and a cytoplasmic tail. (B) Design of VsVg fusion constructs. From top to bottom, the fVsVg fused with either rFP (fVsVg-rFP) or gFP (fVsVg-gFP) at the c-terminal, the ectodomain was replaced by rFP (rFP-mVsVg), the fVsVg fused with Gaussia luciferase (gluc) at the c-terminal (fVsVg-gluc), and the ectodomain was replaced by gluc (gluc-mVsVg). (C) a proposed model illustrating how VsVg participates in exosomes in a mammalian cell. ectopic expression of VsVg occurs at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (er) via its sP guiding, and subsequently sP-cleaved VsVg is funneled to the plasma membrane and becomes concentrated in tetraspanin (CD63)-enriched microdomains, where the first inward budding begins to form endosomes. The second inward budding from the endosome forms exosomes that are stored in a MVB prior to release into extracellular space. (D) schematic illustration of the pseudotyped and protein-loaded exosome. Membrane topology of VsVg (black), loaded protein cargo gFP (green) or rFP (red), and exosome markers (cD63/cD81, blue) are indicated.
