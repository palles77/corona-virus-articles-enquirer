Materials and methods: PBMC were challenged with tetanus toxoid (5\u03bcg/ mL) and PHA (10 \u03bcg/mL) in absence or presence of ribavirin at different concentrations (1, 10 and 100 (\u03bcM). Parallel sets of wells containing PBMC exposed to medium alone were used as negative controls. On day 3 after initiation of the cultures, IL-2, IFN-, IL-4, IL-10, TNFcontent were determined in supernatants of PBMC from the different individuals. Results: The effects of ribavirin on cytokine released by human PBMC in response to PHA and TT showed a great variation among individuals. No significant changes were observed between 1-10 M concentrations in the production of TNF-, IFN-and IL-10 by both PHA and TT-stimulated PBMC. Ribavirin inhibited TNF-, IFN-, and IL-10 in both PHA and TTstimulated PBMC at 100 \u03bcM (p <0.05). At this concentration, ribavirin induced an increase of 124% in the production of IL-2 by PHA-stimulated PBMC (p <0.05). Conclusions: The present data suggest that ribavirin may cause diverse effects on immunoregulatory cytokine secretion with changes in the Th1/Th2 balance.",

Ribavirun monotherapy in chronic hepatitis C infection normalizes alanino-aminotransferase (ALT) levels leading to a biochemical response in most patients but has minor activity on serum HCV-RNA titers. 5 Recent data have shown that a treatment combining ribavirin and alpha interferon is better than interferon alone, with a 38-43% sustained virological response rate. 6 Moreover, the combination therapy of ribavirin and pegilated interferons induces sustained virological response in a higher proportion of patients. 7 Although the mechanism by which the drug exerts its response on patients with chronic HCV infection is under evaluation, there is evidence that ribavirin is likely to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Previous studies have shown that ribavirin has immunosuppressive activity, reducing lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens in vitro, prolonging skin allograft survival in rats 8, 9 and inhibiting mast cell secretory processes. 10 We have carried out the present experiment for evaluating the in vitro effects of ribavirin on cytokine production of recall antigens and PHA-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC obtained from healthy individuals.",

Our results showed that ribavirin at high concentrations may induce a significant increase of IL-2 production. It should be noted that a unique feature of lymphocytes is that their activation itself triggers feedback mechanisms that limit their proliferation and differentiation. One of this mechanisms is IL-2-mediated feedback regulation. IL-2 is the prototypical T cell growth factor and functions in a paracrine manner to stimulate clonal expansion of antigen-stimulated lymphocytes and \"bystander\" cells. Early in a T cell response, when IL-2 concentrations are low, the proliferative effect may be dominant, but when the cytokine accumulates, it may function to terminate the response. 14 Therefore, high IL-2 levels enhance FAS-mediated apoptosis of T-cells and other activation feed-back control mechanism that activate termination of T-cell immune response. 12 In agreement with our observations, Martin et al. reported that high concentrations of ribavirin markedly increase secretion of IL-2 and suppressed IFN-production in cultured PBMC from chronic hepatitis C patients. 15 In addition, we found that ribavirin inhibited TNFsecretion, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. This effect could be another mechanism that would explain ALT normalization in patients receiving the drug.",

Ribavirin can be given orally with a bioavailability of 40 to 50%, intravenously or as an aerosol. In adult population peak plasma levels of 1.3 \u03bcg/mL are obtained after an oral dose of 600 mg. Intravenous administration of 1,000 mg may produce peak plasma levels of 24 \u03bcg/mL. After aerosol administration, ribavirin is found in plasma at levels of 0.2 to 1 \u03bcg/mL, although concentrations in respiratory secretions can be up to 1000-fold higher. 4 Mean serum ribavirin concentration of 3.24 \u00b1 1.35 \u03bcg/mL were found in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with the combination therapy, 16, 17 and serum concentration of 6 \u03bcM following oral administration of 1,000 mg of the drug have been reported. 18 Nevertheless, it was shown that ribavirin and its metabolites could be selectively concentrated and retained by specifics cells, such as human red blood cells and perhaps hepatocytes. 19, 20 Moreover, ribavirin was found in significantly higher concentrations in patients with sustained response. 17 We observed that the effects of ribavirin on cytokine production were dose-related since at higher concentrations the drug induced the most remarkable effects. Therefore, at higher concentrations ribavirin may have the capacity to interfere with immune response by termination the T cell immune mediated damage caused by persistent HCV infection. In conclusion, the present study shows that ribavirin is able to induce diverse effects on immunoregulatory cytokine secretion altering the Th1/Th2 balance. In chronic hepatitis C the drug would be able to reduce the cytokine effect of immune cells via its ability to inhibit their proliferation and production of inflammatory cytokines. ",
