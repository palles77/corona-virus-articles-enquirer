There was a wide range in the proportion of syndrome visits to overall visits reported by EDs (0.04% to 2.8%).

However, we evaluated the accuracy of Web reporting by reviewing the concordance between electronic summaries and checklists retained in the EDs. On several days, some EDs reported more syndrome visits on regional emergency medicine Internet than were reflected by syndromepositive checklists and on other days, fewer. These overreported and underreported 24-hour totals almost completely cancelled one another and were due to 1-day differences between the actual patient visit (recorded on the checklist) and the date on which the regional emergency medicine Internet was used to report the case. Thus, they did not bias overall temporal incidence trends. Disparities in reports of rarer conditions occasionally resulted in alarming syndrome rates, requiring telephone follow-up with the affected ED. For example, one ED reported 3 ''central nervous system infection'' cases in 1 day, representing 43% of total central nervous system infection reports throughout the 4-week surveillance period. A telephone call was sufficient to ascertain that this was keystroke error (confirmed by review of checklists and triage logs). Such events were evaluated rapidly by telephone contact without the need for public health staff to visit the ED or for other excessive staff time. They also indicate that a modest sustained (3-day) or sharp increase in the numbers or proportions of persons with syndromes in the region would likely be detected, despite the observed inconsistencies in screening and reporting practices.",

EDs were also asked to collect forms in midnight-to-midnight batches and directly record on the regional emergency medicine Internet screen the date for which daily visit totals were reported.

Respondents' mean estimate of the time checklist completion added to patients' stay in the ED was 4 minutes (range zero to 5 minutes). The mean estimate of added staff time for the surveillance project was 9 minutes per patient (range 3 to 25 minutes). Systematic measurements of time are not yet available for the SARS project, but initial observations suggest the simpler screening and reporting system are efficient. When the SARS screening tool is used only for patients with measured fever or history of fever, only 5% to 8% of overall patients have a screening form completed. Observations suggest that completion of this form requires less than 3 minutes, and it takes a staff person 5 minutes to enter the 24-hour counts on the regional emergency medicine Internet each day.

A sustained (3-day) or marked increase in the absolute or proportional numbers of syndrome cases would have been readily apparent by visual review of trend graphs, and data were also readily downloaded into the Early Aberration Reporting System detection program. Follow-up investigation is easily directed to specific EDs, specific syndromes, and specific date ranges, minimizing unnecessary epidemiologist labor. The All Star Game surveillance project was well accepted by ED managers, with modest impact on patient ED visit time. Continuing use of regional emergency medicine Internet, established relationships between local public health and EDs, and the immediacy of a plausible threat contributed to rapid establishment of the second (SARS) project.",

This weak point was improved in the SARS project by focusing on a simple modification of everyday triage routines. Shared sentinel surveillance code sets, such as those provided by the Frontlines of Medicine, and cross-platform coding and electronic transmission standards, such as those developed for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Public Health Information Network, should permit automatic and consistent collection and transmission of sentinel surveillance markers from routinely created records such as triage logs or billing codes. 8, 9 The regional emergency medicine Internet software application provides a convenient and practical network for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of such surveillance.",
