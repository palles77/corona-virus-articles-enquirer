This infection has had a profound effect on nursing practice and patient care in the GTA. The impact of SARS is analogous to the effect of HIV in the early 1980s. The causative agent is not well understood, a diagnostic test has not yet been developed, the mode of transmission is not well understood, no treatment regimen has been established, no immunization exists, and patients are dying. Hospitals have used the one and only tool available to control this outbreak: strict isolation procedures to eliminate transmission.",

Airborne transmission is thought to potentially play a role in some settings, accounting for spread that has occurred in some apartment buildings in Asia. 3, 4 The first person who was diagnosed with SARS in Toronto had recently traveled to Hong Kong. The unfortunate woman died from the infection, and several of her family members developed the illness through household contact. In turn, these infected family members transmitted the infection to ED health care workers and patients before the implementation of isolation precautions. While the disease has been transmitted in the community, most of those infected are health care workers who were infected in patient care settings. 5 The first patient died on March 5, 2003. On March 13, Mount Sinai Hospital received its first patient with the illness. On April 10, 19 patients with suspected or probable cases of SARS had been treated, and 11 of those patients were health care providers. 6 To date, 51% of SARS cases in the GTA are nurses and physicians, and 77% of the total cases of SARS are the result of exposure within the hospital setting. 5",

It is difficult to identify infected individuals because there are no hallmark clinical symptoms for SARS and no diagnostic test to identify the virus. At the start of the outbreak, we had few patients with suspected SARS presenting to our emergency department, and the epidemiologic links were clear. As the extent of the outbreak grew, the epidemiologic links became vague. SARS is classifed as \"Suspect and Probable.\" Many patients we admitted to the hospital were diagnosed as \"Suspect SARS.\" They were clinically and hemodynamically stable. Some had normal chest radiography with no infiltrates demonstrated (yet) but had symptoms of fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise, and 1 of 3 distinct exposures: they had either traveled to Vietnam, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, or Taiwan; they had been exposed to a person with SARS; or they had been a health care worker, patient, or visitor in a hospital in the GTA where there had been recorded cases of SARS transmission. The diagnosis of \"Probable SARS\" is distinguished by the above, plus severe progression of respiratory illness (cough, shortness of breath, tachypnea, desaturation) and demonstrated radiographic findings. 5 We developed a triage screening tool to elicit information about exposure, symptoms, and an epidemiologic link to SARS. If patients had a positive response to any of the questions in the screening tool, exhibited symptoms, or had a positive epidemiologic link to the illness, it meant that we would initiate the SARS protocol. An N95 mask was applied, and the patient was triaged to the negative pressure airflow isolation room in the emergency department.",

The screening tool was revised several times to include the new list of possible exposures and symptoms.

Triage takes place with the patient wearing an N95 mask. We obtain the triage history and complete the SARS patient screening tool (including temperature assessment). We determine the patient's disposition based on the presenting complaint or a positive response to the SARS screening tool. All visitors who are permitted entry to the emergency department and all paramedics accompanying ambulance patients also require screening. The SARS screening process has increased the amount of time it takes to triage patients, so that sometimes triage requires 2 nurses. The impact on ED space Mount Sinai Emergency Department, an urban academic facility, has experienced an increase in its annual volume of ED patients over the past 3 years, with an average of 37,000 visits annually. We have outgrown the physical capacity of the department such that every square foot of the department, including hallway locations, is used for patient care. Our philosophy has been that sick patients are safer being cared for in a hallway space than in the waiting room. Before SARS, we had 26 stretcher bays and could add 7 more hallway stretchers if volumes were high. With the advent of SARS, this practice has changed. In order to prevent the potential transmission of SARS, all hallway spaces have been eliminated. Several of our stretcher bays were only divided by a curtain and these have also been closed. Our resuscitation room had 2 divided rooms, each with 2 stretchers; this has been reduced to 1 stretcher in each room, leaving us with only 16 spaces in the department. The emergency department is equipped with one permanent, reverse/negative air isolation room with an anteroom. As the number of patients with positive epidemiologic links or symptoms of SARS increased, we had to create additional negative pressure isolation rooms. Engineering and building services were pressed into service to help control the spread of infection with airflow and pressure adaptations. They created 6 additional negative pressure rooms in our emergency department, giving us a total of 7 negative pressure isolation rooms. We are currently considering further renovations, including replacing curtains with wall barriers between stretcher bays and creating additional reverse isolation and anterooms.",

In particular, those patients with community-acquired pneumonia have been extremely difficult to differentiate from those with SARS. Patients who historically would have been triaged to a non-acute area with \"viral illness\" are now triaged to a negative pressure isolation room. Our inability to clinically rule out SARS has led to an extensive diagnostic assessment and workup of many patients. The most reliable diagnostic indicator for SARS is chest radiography (posteroanterior and lateral) to assess for infiltrates. Early in the outbreak, we discovered that portable x-rays were limited in their ability to identify early pulmonary infiltrates. A written protocol, including appropriate patient dress (N95 mask, gloves, and isolation gown), was developed for transportation and imaging in our emergency department's x-ray suite. Laboratory investigation includes a complete blood count, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, creatinine, lactic dehydrogenase, liver function tests, and 2 sets of blood cultures. We collect several tubes of blood for serology and cytokine studies for future research of the illness. Throat swabs are collected for viral studies. Early studies have found that the hallmark diagnostic indicators of SARS are: leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase. 4 As more cases of the illness were identified, additional abnormalities were noted, including low calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and potassium levels and an elevated creatinine kinase on admission. 5 However, the specificity of these laboratory tests is unknown. A SARS clinical decision-making tool is in the process of being developed to assist clinicians in the screening, diagnosis, and management of the illness.",

The causal exposures of health care workers have been largely related to respiratory procedures and interventions including endotracheal intubation, airway suctioning, and bronchoscopy. 3, 7 As a result of these exposures, we have altered patient management guidelines and treatment protocols. The triage screening tool was drafted at least 5 times, the diagnostic tests were drafted again, the process for infectious disease consults became more inclusive, and the POC issued new directives daily (regarding isolation procedures, human resource issues, etc.). A policy is currently being drafted for intubation and code blue procedures for non-SARS and suspect SARS cases. Powered air purifying respirator hoods (PAPR; 3M, St Paul, Minn) have been added to the arsenal of essential equipment required for patient intubation, and the number of staff involved in such procedures is limited. Since the beginning of the outbreak, all treatments with noninvasive ventilation, nebulized medications, and humidified gases have been suspended. All bag valve masks are now single-patient use only, and filters have been added. Filtered rebreather masks delivering 80% oxygen have been introduced for SARS patients who require high flow oxygen. Single-patient use disposable oxygen saturation probes have also been introduced as a means of reducing potential transmission of the illness.",

This system was designed to eliminate the spread of infection between health care institutions. The POC requires all sending facilities to communicate and document clearance from the infection control practitioners at both the sending and receiving facility. Every hospital in the GTA has been given a SARS category rating from 0 (no known SARS cases) to 3 (unprotected SARS exposure with transmission to staff and or patients). The category of both facilities is documented and taken into account in a decision-making algorithm. The triage patient-screening process becomes a vital component of the application process. A patient transfer authorization form is completed and faxed to the POC office. Approval or denial from the physician at the POC is faxed to the sending facility. Patients transferred to the emergency department from long-term care facilities go through this process, unless their condition is unstable or life threatening.",

The goal of preventing the spread of the illness has resulted in many changes in day-to-day work life. Meal breaks are the only time that staff are permitted to remove their masks. Breaks have to be taken either alone or in small groups with a distance of 3 ft between one another. Only one person is able to have his or her mask removed at one time in an enclosed room. Once staff are done eating and drinking, the masks must be put back on. As a means of supporting staff under the current circumstances, the hospital has been supplying staff on all units with bottled water and bagged snacks.",

GTA health care workers who became ill were young and healthy, much like the staff taking care of them, and we all knew that others had died of this disease. Many of the staff also struggle with their conflicting roles. They are professionals, but they are also family members who need to protect their own family and friends. Many nurses have had personal appointments, such as those for routine dental care, canceled by providers because of the concern that the disease might be spread. Many of our family members and friends were reluctant to socialize with us over Easter and Passover.

We needed to hear positive words and encouragement to keep up our morale. Leadership staff have also increased their hours of work and adopted shift hours (including evenings, nights, and weekends) as a means of being visible and ensuring adequate support for staff. This has meant some 18hour days and 14-day stretches. The Infection Control and Infectious Diseases Departments have been our guide and practice leaders.
