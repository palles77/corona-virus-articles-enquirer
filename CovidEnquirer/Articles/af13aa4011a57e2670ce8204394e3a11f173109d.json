            "text": "Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapies have great promise in the treatment of a number of prevalent pulmonary disorders including lung cancer, asthma and cystic fibrosis. However, progress in this area has been hindered due to the lack of carriers that can efficiently deliver siRNA to lung epithelial cells, and also due to challenges in developing oral inhalation (OI) formulations for the regional administration of siRNA and their carriers to the lungs. In this work we report the ability of generation four, amine-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer (G4NH2)\u2212 siRNA complexes (dendriplexes) to silence the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene on A549 lung alveolar epithelial cells stably expressing eGFP. We also report the formulation of the dendriplexes and their aerosol characteristics in propellant-based portable OI devices. The size and gene silencing ability of the dendriplexes was seen not to be a strong function of the N/P ratio. Silencing efficiencies of up to 40% are reported. Stable dispersions of the dendriplexes encapsulated in mannitol and also in a biodegradable and water-soluble co-oligomer were prepared in hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-based pressurized metereddose inhalers (pMDIs). Their aerosol characteristics were very favorable, and conducive to deep lung deposition, with respirable fractions of up to 77%. Importantly, siRNA formulated as dendriplexes in pMDIs was shown to keep its integrity after the particle preparation processes, and also after long-term exposures to HFA. The relevance of this study stems from the fact that this is the first work to report the formulation of inhalable siRNA with aerosol properties suitable to deep lung deposition using pMDIs devices that are the least expensive and most widely used portable inhalers. This study is relevant because, also for the first time, it shows that siRNA\u2212G4NH2 dendriplexes can efficiently target lung alveolar epithelial A549 cells and silence genes even after siRNA has been exposed to the propellant environment.",

Even though many publications have addressed the transfection of cells using dendrimer\u2212DNA complexes, 17 few reports have discussed the gene silencing (with siRNA 3, 18 or antisense oligonucleotide 19 ) with PAMAM dendrimers in cells that are models of the lung alveolar epithelium.",

We report the preparation and characterization of siRNA\u2212G4NH2 dendriplexes, and evaluate the in vitro gene knockdown efficiency in a model lung alveolar epithelial cell line. We propose different formulation strategies for the dendriplexes, and study their aerosol performance. The relevance of this study stems from the fact that this is the first work to report the formulation of inhalable siRNA with aerosol properties suitable to deep lung deposition in pMDIs, which are the least expensive and most widely used portable inhalers available in the market.

Preparation and Characterization of siRNA\u2212G4NH2 Dendriplexes. Dendriplexes were formed by combining equal volumes (10\u2212100 \u03bcL) of negatively charged siRNA (50\u2212150 \u03bcg \u00d7 mL \u22121 , RNase free DI-water) and positively charged PAMAM G4NH2 (150\u22123000 \u03bcg \u00d7 mL \u22121 , 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 buffer RNase free). 18, 23 siRNA solution was added dropwise into the G4NH2 solution under vortex at 3000 rpm (VWR Digital Vortex Mixer) for 1 min. The siRNA\u2212G4NH2 dispersions were kept at room temperature for at least 30 min before any experiments, in order to ensure complete formation of the dendriplexes. 23 The G4NH2 concentration was varied in order to prepare dendriplexes at different N/P ratios\ue0d5the molar ratio between the primary amine groups (N) from G4NH2 and phosphate groups (P) from siRNA. 24 siRNA\u2212G4NH2 dendriplex dispersions (minimum of five independent batches, n = 5) were quantitatively analyzed using PicoGreen assay 25 in a Synergy 2 Microplate Reader (BioTek, VT) for the uncomplexed siRNA content, which was calculated using a linear calibration curve (siRNA concentration vs fluorescent units). PicoGreen is an ultrasensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain used to quantify double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) 25 and ds-siRNA in solution. 26 The siRNA complexation efficiency (CE) was calculated on the basis of the difference between the initial amount of siRNA added during the formation of the dendriplexes and the non-entrapped free siRNA remaining in the dendriplex dispersion, i.e., an indirect measurement of the siRNA content complexed with PAMAM G4NH2 within dendriplexes.",

The histogram of the measured diameters (>400 particles) was fit to a Gaussian distribution, from which average and standard deviation were calculated. For AFM imaging, 20 \u03bcL of siRNA\u2212G4NH2 dendriplex dispersion was deposited on a freshly cleaved mica sheet and incubated at room temperature for 5 min 28 to allow the binding of the dendriplexes onto the substrate. The substrate was then washed with few drops of DI-water, and dried with gentle air flow. AFM images were obtained using a Multi-75 silicon AFM probe in AC tapping mode. 28 Gel Retardation Assay. The capacity of G4NH2 to form complexes with siRNA was also examined by gel electrophoresis. A known volume of the dendriplex dispersion (equivalent to 300 ng siRNA) was loaded in the slots of casted nondenaturing agarose gel (1.5% w/v in tris base, acetic acid, and EDTA (TAE) 1X pH 8.2 buffer) stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 \u03bcg \u00d7 mL \u22121 ).

LS was performed with dendriplexes at 80 nM siRNA, and in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 (for size) and pure water (for \u03b6). ImageJ was used to estimate the size of the dendriplexes from the SEM images: histograms of the measured diameters (> 400 particles) were fitted to Gaussian distributions, from which the average size and standard deviation was obtained. is seen to efficiently protect siRNA from RNase A degradation upon complexation. As seen in Figure 3 , for all tested N/P ratios, the siRNA released from the dendriplexes after being kept in contact with RNase A (lanes 3, 7, 11, and 15) was comparable to the siRNA extracted from the dendriplexes which were not exposed to RNase A (lanes 5, 9, 13, and 17positive controls, respectively). Next, siRNA\u2212G4NH2 dendriplexes formed at N/P 5 were incubated with increasing concentrations of RNase A (0.35, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 3.5 \u03bcg per 1 \u03bcg siRNA) for 6 h at 37\u00b0C, following RNase inhibitor and heparin treatments, and gel electrophoresis, in order to probe the protection efficiency provided by the dendrimers at increasing RNase A concentrations. The results are shown in Figure 4 and again indicate that the siRNA was sufficiently protected from RNase degradation upon complexation with PAMAM G4NH2.

The release is much slower at acidic medium than at physiological pH. At low pHs (<5) all primary and tertiary amines from PAMAM G4NH2 are protonated, 40 and consequently the electrostatic interactions between the positively charged dendrimer and negatively charged siRNA increase, which results in stronger binding and lower siRNA released at low pH. At physiological pH 7.4 the tertiary amines are deprotonated, and only the primary amines are protonated, 40 which decreases the electrostatic interactions between siRNA and G4NH2, and as a result, the release of the siRNA increases at higher pH.",

After 3\u22125 days, it was observed that 8\u221210% siRNA was released from the dendriplexes, which corresponds to 13\u221216 pmol.

While no literature results are available for the in vitro release of siRNA from PAMAM dendriplexes, we can contrast the results obtained here with the release of oligonucleotide (ON) from PEI polyplexes. 41 At N/P 15 and 40 in PBS pH 7.4 and 37\u00b0C, 55% ON was released from PEI after 20 days (i.e., ON was released faster from PEI at N/P 40 than N/P 15), a result somehow similar to that observed here\u2212siRNA released slightly faster from G4NH2 at N/P 30 than N/P 20 in buffer pH 7.4. This is likely due to hydrophilization 41 operated by G4NH2, i.e., dendriplexes formed at higher N/P have increased G4NH2 content, which can contribute for more rapid entry of water molecules into the dendriplexes. Water molecules can penetrate throughout the G4NH2 interior, cause the dendrimer structure to swell (due to the favorable interaction of water molecules with the primary and tertiary amines), 42, 43 and thus release the siRNA. However, the amount of siRNA released from dendriplexes at N/P 30 was statistically significant different from that at N/P 20 at 12 h and day 2 only.

Despite this low-to-moderate gene silencing in vitro, the proposed siRNA\u2212 G4NH2 dendriplexes have the potential to demonstrate gene silencing in vivo (following optimization, but such is not the focus of this work), since PAMAM-based nanocarreirs have shown promising results in the delivering siRNA in vivo, even if the gene silencing efficiency in vivo is lower compared to that observed in vitro. 3, 23, 53 This is due to the siRNA potency, i.e., very small amounts of siRNA (once properly delivered to the target site) are shown sufficient for effective in vivo gene silencing. 54\u221256 It is worth noticing a reduction in eGFP expression in A549 cells is also observed when the scramble siRNA(\u2212) was delivered using LF (34%), TF (19.5%), and G4NH2 (6\u221215%): Figure 7 . It has been shown that LF/siRNA(\u2212) complexes cause measurable and undesirable gene silencing \u223c25\u221250% in different cell types. 57, 58 This unwanted eGFP suppression is most likely due to off-target effects, 59 which can be due to toxicity of nanocarrier, 57 and also due to the similarity between the nucleotide sequence from the siRNA(\u2212) and short motifs in mRNA and other unrelated genes not targeted during the transfection. 59, 60 Alterations in gene expression in vitro and in vivo have been also reported for several types of nanocarriers, including linear and branched PEI, 61 PEG\u2212PEI, 61 polypropylenimine (PPI), 62 diaminobutane (DAB). 62 Off-target effects in RNAi are quite common and an issue of consideration when developing RNAi technologies, 60 but may be hard to avoid, 59 and are still not well understood. 61 In Vitro Gene Knockdown of siRNA\u2212G4NH2 Dendriplexes Exposed to Propellant HFA. In order to test whether the biological activity of the siRNA was preserved after the Figure 7 . In vitro knockdown of eGFP expression in A549 cells stably expressing eGFP. siRNA\u2212G4NH2 dendriplexes were prepared with siRNA as received from the supplier at N/P 5, 10, 20, and 30; with lyophilized siRNA stored in HFA-227 (HFA, at 25\u00b0C and saturation pressure of the propellant) and freezer at \u221220\u00b0C (FRE, at 253 K) for 2 months, at N/P 20. Specificity of the knockdown (siRNA(+) sequence, anti-eGFP) is maintained by comparison to effects with the siRNA(\u2212) sequence (scramble). Lipofectamine 2000 (LF) and Transfast (TF) were the commercial transfection reagents used as positive controls, and free siRNA was the negative control. G4NH2 concentration at N/P 30 corresponds to 1.95 \u03bcM, and siRNA concentration in all systems was 80 nM. *,\u25bc, \u29eb = statistically significantly different compared to eGFP A549 cells treated with free siRNA(+) as received; and \u2207 = no statistically significant difference (n.s.d.) among N/P 5, 10, 20, and 30 prepared with siRNA(+) as received (minimum n = 3, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test, p value <0.05). formulation in the pMDI (under HFA atmosphere), the gene knockdown activity of dendriplexes formed with siRNA(+) that was lyophilized and stored under HFA-227 at 25\u00b0C and saturation pressure of the propellant for two months, was compared to a control (lyophilized but stored at \u221220\u00b0C). Gene knockdown experiments were performed on eGFP A549 cells as discussed above, with dendriplexes having an N/P ratio of 20, and the results are shown in Figure 7 . Even after storage conditions in propellant HFA, it can be observed that the siRNA(+) was still biologically active to silence the eGFP expression in A549 cells: \u223c69% and 22% eGFP knockdown for TF and dendriplexes at N/P 20, respectively. Similar values were obtained with the control siRNA(+) that was not stored under HFA-227, but at \u221220\u00b0C in freezer (FRE)\ue0d567% and 22% for TF and N/P 20, respectively. The gene silencing efficiency was found to be statistically significant between the eGFP cells treated with TF/siRNA(+) and dendriplexes at N/P 20\u2212for both storages in HFA and FRE, when compared to cells treated with free siRNA(+) as received. Most importantly, the gene knockdown efficiency provided by dendriplexes at N/P 20 (and TF) prepared with siRNA(+) as received, stored in HFA and FRE, was found not to be statistically significantly different (minimum n = 3, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test, p value <0.05). Collectively, these results indicate that the biological activity of the siRNA is kept after long-term exposure in propellant HFA.",

            "text": "Preparation and Characterization of Microparticles Loaded with Dendriplexes. There are major obstacles in the regional delivery of the dendriplexes to the lungs when using OI devices. While the dendriplexes are in the order of nanometers in size, the optimum aerosol size for deep lung deposition is in the micrometer range (0.5\u22125 \u03bcm). 63 Particles with an aerodynamic diameter <0.5 \u03bcm may be exhaled, while those >5 \u03bcm tend to be deposited in the mouth and throat, ending up in the digestive tract. Moreover, alveolar macrophages are most selective to particles of 1\u22123 \u03bcm, and less efficient toward larger (\u22736 \u03bcm) and smaller (\u2272260 nm) particles. 12 In the case of pMDIs, another hurdle that needs to be overcome is the physical stabilization of the microparticle dispersions (suspension) in the low dielectric propellant HFA. 64, 65 It is necessary, therefore, to develop particle engineering strategies capable of forming stable suspension of the dendriplexes in the form of microparticles suitable for deep lung deposition and able to minimize the uptake by alveolar macrophages. We demonstrate in this work two such strategies. One consists in encapsulating the dendriplexes within mannitol microparticles, via spray drying; the other consists in using a CSLA co-oligomer shell that is formed during emulsification diffusion. Mannitol was chosen as it has high aqueous solubility, it is a generally recognized as a safe (GRAS) excipient widely used as bulking agent and nonactive carrier in dry powder inhalers. 66 Mannitol particles alone also have shown to have less adhesion/cohesion in propellant HFA, slower sedimentation rates, and superior aerosol performance than other sugars, such as lactose. 67 The CSLA co-oligomer was chosen because it is water-soluble and interfacially active at the W/O interface of the emulsion droplets (it migrates/resides at the interface formed between the small water droplets into the large ethyl acetate organic phase). 65 During the emulsification diffusion, the dendriplexes are kept within the water emulsion droplets, and then encapsulated by the CSLA co-oligomer residing at the W/O interface of the emulsion droplets. Thus, the organic phase is not expected to be in contact with the siRNA of the dendriplexes and/or affect somehow the dendriplex aggregates within the CSLA microparticles. In addition, the CSLA cooligomer is degradable and non-HFA soluble\u2212i.e., the shell will not disintegrate in HFA but will break down when in contact with the fluid lining the lungs. 65 The ester groups from the LA are HFA-philic, 64, 68 and microparticles formed with CSLA shell have shown enhanced physical stability in propellant HFAs. 33, 36, 65 An important detail is that the nonactive ingredients used to form these microparticles (mannitol and CSLA) can readily dissolve in aqueous media 65, 66 as the fluid lining the lungs, thus releasing the nanosized dendriplexes, and consequently minimizing the alveolar macrophage uptake. In addition, it is also worthwhile to point out that we have previously shown that CSLA does not impact the gene transfer potential of CSLA-based microparticles as carriers for CS-pDNA complexes. 33 The size and morphology of the CSLA and mannitol microparticles containing siRNA\u2212G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P Figure 8 . Size and morphology of (a) mannitol and (b) CSLA engineered microparticles loaded with siRNA\u2212G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 as determined by LS (main distribution on right) and SEM (lower lef t inset). Particles were dispersed in HPFP (2 mg \u00d7 mL \u22121 ) to perform LS, and after that, the HPFP was evaporated, and 1 mL DI-water was added to dissolve the mannitol or CSLA shell, and LS was performed again, but at this time, the size of the dendriplexes released from the mannitol (or CSLA) was measured (upper lef t inset). 10 were evaluated by LS and SEM. The results are shown in Figure 8 . Microparticles were loaded with dendriplexes at N/P 10 instead of N/P 5 and 20 (even though dendriplexes at N/P 5, 10, and 20 resulted in similar in vitro gene knockdown efficiency, as shown in Figure 7 ) because N/P 10 produced slightly smaller and more stable dendriplexes in solution (please refer to Table 1 ) than did N/P 5 and 20.",

These results suggest that the spherical dendriplexes carrying microparticles are in the desired size range for appropriate deep lung deposition. 67 It is worthwhile to mention that the size of the dendriplexes at N/P 10 was measured by LS after contacting the microparticles with aqueous solution, and it was found to be 236 \u00b1 75 nm and 192 \u00b1 38 nm for CSLA and mannitol, respectively. Size distribution by LS is shown as inset in Figure  8 ; average and standard deviation calculated based on five (n = 5) independent experiments. Thus, the hydrodynamic diameter of the dendriplexes at N/P 10 released from the shell are readily comparable to those (Table 1 ) before loading into CSLA or mannitol microparticles and are nonstatistically significantly different (n = 5, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test, p value <0.05).
