Modify antibiotic therapy based on test results. \u2022 If there is no clinical response to medical therapy in 2 days, or if gangrene rapidly develops, consider surgical removal of the affected mammary tissue. Because of the potential for severe toxicity and life-threatening disease, do not delay surgery if gangrene is already present, or if there is no improvement with medical therapy. \u2022 If the jill continues to lactate, leave the kits with her. Supplement feed the kits with a kitten milk replacer if necessary.
