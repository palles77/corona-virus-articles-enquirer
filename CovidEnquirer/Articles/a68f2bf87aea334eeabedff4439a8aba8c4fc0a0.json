This supplement provides suggestions for all of those involved in a disaster or pandemic with multiple critically ill patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, professional societies, and public health or government offi cials. The current Task Force included a total of 100 participants from nine countries, comprised of clinicians and experts from a wide variety of disciplines. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted to identify studies upon which evidence-based recommendations could be made. No studies of suffi cient quality were identifi ed. Therefore, the panel developed expert-opinion-based suggestions that are presented in this supplement using a modifi ed Delphi process. The ultimate aim of the supplement is to expand the focus beyond the walls of ICUs to provide recommendations for the management of all critically ill or injured adults and children resulting from a pandemic or disaster wherever that care may be provided. Considerations for the management of critically ill patients include clinical priorities and logistics (supplies, evacuation, and triage) as well as the key enablers (systems planning, business continuity, legal framework, and ethical considerations) that facilitate the provision of this care. The supplement also aims to illustrate how the concepts of mass critical care are integrated across the spectrum of surge events from conventional through contingency to crisis standards of care.",

Th e supplement was received enthusiastically by both the medical and broader public health communities, becoming the second most frequently downloaded supplement from CHEST's website, and papers from the supplement have been cited in 157 publications indexed on the Web of Science ( http :// thomsonreuters . com / web -of -science ). Th e eff ort was timely, as many hospitals applied the suggestions to respond to regional crises related to the 2009 infl uenza A(H1N1) pandemic. 10 -16 Several recent disasters have brought new learning since the original documents were published. Also, the 2008 documents had minimal direction for the management of pediatrics, trauma, subspecialty ICU populations, or critical care outside of developed countries. Consequently, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care was reconvened with an expanded scope and expertise to provide a rigorously developed set of usable guidelines to critical care providers responding to disasters or pandemics throughout the world.",

Th e magnitude of surge is illustrated by the alterations in the balance between demand (stick people) and supply (medication boxes). As surge increases, the demand-supply imbalance worsens. Conventional, contingency, and crisis responses are used to respond to the varying magnitude of surge. Varying response strategies are associated with each level of response. As the magnitude of the surge increases, the strategies used to cope with the response gradually depart from the usual standard of care (default defi ning the standards of disaster care) until such point that even with crisis care, critical care is no longer able to be provided. Our methodology had to recognize that there is still a paucity of high-quality evidence upon which to develop evidence-based recommendations for Mass Critical Care. Th e Task Force met in Chicago, Illinois in June 2012 to develop key questions. We then conducted comprehensive literature searches to identify evidence that could be used to answer the questions and provide evidence-based \"recommendations.\" Although some relevant studies were identifi ed, none of the studies provided a suffi cient quality of evidence upon which to make recommendations; therefore, expert opinion was solicited to provide answers (\"suggestions\") to the key questions. To improve the rigor of the expert opinion, a modifi ed Delphi process was used following the structure and guidelines established by the CHEST Guidelines Oversight Committee. 27 Th e primary context for the Task Force's suggestions remains health-care systems in the developed world. Th e language used throughout this supplement is not intended to refer to any one specifi c national context but rather should be viewed to be applicable in most large countries organized with a geographically based political structure incorporating a single national government with successive tiers of governments extending to local levels ( Fig 3 ) . 28 , 29 Because the audience for these suggestions is those in resource-rich settings in developed countries, the Task Force has separately addressed the issue of mass critical care in resource-poor settings and provides suggestions to improve the provision of care in this context by strengthening existing systems and leveraging strategic relationships with world bodies and organizations from developed countries.",

Indeed, this research should be a moral imperative in both resource-rich and resourcepoor areas of the world. In the developed world, research should be directed at the provision of critical care during MCC; in resource-poor areas research on building capacity in the current system and on ways to decrease the need for intensive care would be of greater benefi t. Granted, signifi cant challenges exist with regard to conducting research in these settings, 30 but these challenges can be overcome by \"disruptive creativity\" and planning. Conducting research during disasters or pandemics requires novel approaches to address the unique logistic and ethical and methodology challenges of operating and collaborating in these environments. Research questions that currently need to be addressed are discussed in detail within each of the individual articles within this supplement. In the absence of scientifi c evidence, experts' opinion, although less than ideal, will have to suffi ce. Clearly, much research needs to be done to enrich the tacit knowledge of experts.",

In addition to updating the suggestions, this version of the Task Forces' suggestions addresses the broader issue of caring for the critically ill and injured from pandemics and disasters beyond the walls of the ICU, across the age continuum, and those from special populations who are particularly vulnerable to being negatively impacted and who require specialized critical care. Moreover, the Task Force provides suggestions regarding the evacuation of the critically ill and injured as well as the legal, ethical, and systems frameworks necessary to support an eff ective response.

Forming partnerships and close coordination between surge teams and pre-existing stakeholders (local government offi cials, medical and surgical care providers, rehabilitation-related NGOs, local and national public health) to ensure a successful transition, 8b. Assessing the access to and capacity of local emergency and critical care services once the surge resources leave, 8c. Addressing the disaster's impact on health-care providers' and surviving patients' short and long-term mental health needs, 8d. Developing and using standardized data collection instruments to facilitate assessment and validation of best practices for eff ective disengagement and reconstitution, and to monitor on-going long-term health needs, 8e. Implementing a tailored approach to disengagement and reconstitution based on the identifi ed local community's needs, 8f. Addressing local logistical challenges to deliver emergency and critical care routinely and during disasters, 8g. Ensuring that public health programs are restored and improved and that reconstitution efforts do not displace essential public health activities, which may have greater impact upon the overall community's health, especially for children, 8h. Integrating emergency and critical care services with the delivery of all other medical care and public health programs in the community, 8i. Including long-term follow-up care to the maximum extent possible in planning for the medical needs of survivors; and 8j. Incorporating the training and staffi ng needs for provision of all needed post disaster services, including medical, nursing, social workers, mental health providers, community and public health.",

We suggest hospitals include ethics resources in planning for MCC and should anticipate a need for ethics consultative services during the event. to Providers 16. We suggest hospitals make plans to assist with moral distress in providers involved in providing MCC.17. We suggest critical care clinicians who are unable to accept implementation of crisis standards of care be transferred into support or non-clinical roles during disaster response, if possible, but not be absolved of their obligation to participate in the response.18. We suggest hospitals plan to protect worker safety and encourage providers/workers to create personal/family disaster preparedness plans.19. We suggest researchers collaborate on a national guidance document that develops standards for obtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval in advance of disasters, and off ers ethically, clinically, and legally acceptable mechanisms for research in the disaster context. 20.
