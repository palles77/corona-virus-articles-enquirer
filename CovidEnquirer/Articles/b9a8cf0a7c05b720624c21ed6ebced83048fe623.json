During the 2009 H1N1 infl uenza pandemic, WHO declared the fi rst ever public health emergency of international concern but was criticised for fuelling public fear. State Parties widely disregarded WHO's temporary recommendations; 7, 8 however, in 2011, the Review Committee on International Health Regulations functioning during the H1N1 infl uence pandemic cautioned, \"The world is ill-prepared to respond to a severe infl uenza pandemic.\" 9 In 2014, the Director-General declared two further public health emergencies of international concern, for polio and for Ebola. The designation of polio seemed counterintuitive because only a handful of cases had been diagnosed compared with previous years. Yet, small pockets of polio in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria were putting global eradication at risk. In the case of Ebola, the Director-General waited 4 months after M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res announced an \"unprecedented outbreak\" to declare a public health emergency of international concern on Aug 8, 2014. 10 WHO's Ebola Interim Assessment Panel in July, 2015, said urgent warnings \"either did not reach senior leaders or senior leaders did not recognise their signifi cance.\" 11 Several health emergency events have not resulted in a declaration of a public health emergency of international concern. Currently, the world is watching outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which has not triggered a public health emergency of international concern declaration despite reaching more than 26 countries and causing 575 deaths by November, 2015. 12, 13 The Emergency Committee advised that, without sustained community transmission, the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern have not been met. 14 The Director-General did not even convene an Emergency Committee for major events such as cholera in Haiti, the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and the use of chemical weapons in Syria.",

            "text": "10 years after its adoption, the time has come to realise the International Health Regulations' promise. The unconscionable Ebola epidemic opened a window of opportunity for fundamental reform-both for the International Health Regulations and the organisation that oversees the treaty. That political window, however, is rapidly closing. Donor fatigue, fading memories, and competing priorities are diverting political attention. Empowering WHO and realising the International Health Regulations' potential would shore up global health security-an important investment in human and animal health, while reducing the vast economic consequences of the next global health emergency.",
