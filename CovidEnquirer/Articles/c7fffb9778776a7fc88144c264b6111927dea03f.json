Mild diarrhoea was seen from three to 11 days after inoculation, approximately coincident with faecal virus shedding. Virus was initially isolated from the tonsils on day 3, and then from both small and large intestinal tissues up to 14 days after inoculation. Virus was also isolated from liver and lung. Histological changes were not seen in any tissues, but ccv antigen was detected, using a peroxidase antiperoxidase staining technique, mainly in epithelium overlying gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Virus neutralising antibody was first detected on day 10. Specific anti-ccv IgM was first detected in plasma three days after inoculation and IgG on days 4 to 7. Small amounts of anti-ccv IgG, IgM and IgA were detected in duodenal secretion, but none in bile.",

Clinical signs are considered to be difficult to reproduce experimentally (Appel 1987) , although little work has been reported on this. Moderate signs of disease have been induced experimentally in neonatal pups but incontact bitches showed no clinical signs (Binn et al 1974 . In naturally occurring infections, pups of six to 12 weeks old appear to be more susceptible to disease (Cartwright and Lucas 1972 , Vandenberghe et al 1980 , Carmichael and Binn 1981 .

The precipitates, pelleted by centrifugation at 1300 g for 30 minutes and 13 resuspended in cold tris sodium chloride EDTA (TNE) buffer, were layered over 3 ml of 30 per cent (w/w) sucrose in TNE buffer. After centrifugation at 100,000 g for one hour, the resulting pellets were resuspended in TNE buffer to their original volumes. These antigens were used to coat activated ELISA plates (Flow Laboratories) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by immediate overcoating with polyvinylpyrrolidone (1 per cent) and storage at 4\u00b0C for up to one month. The plates (ccv and tissue culture fluid coated) were incubated with sera (1/100), bile or duodenal secretions (1/20) dilated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/Tween (0.05 per cent) for one hour at 37\u00b0C. Class specific immunoglobulins in the samples were subsequently detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies to dog IgG (1/1000) and IgA (1/200) and human IgM (1/200), followed by alkaline phosphatase conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Sigma). Each well was thoroughly washed three times with PBS/Tween between each stage. Paranitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) was then used as the substrate in a tris/glycine buffer (pH 10\" 4) and the absorbance values were read at 410 nm after 30 minutes.

Although the C54 strain was isolated from a dog with severe haemorrhagic enteritis, some Other factors which may influence the severity of disease include stress or concurrent infection with other pathogens. In this study Campylobacterjejuni was isolated from all the experimental dogs from three weeks before and during the study. Although C jejuni has been associated with diarrhoea in experimental dogs (Macartney et al 1988) many dogs reared in breeding colonies may be asymptomatic excretors (Newton et al 1988) . No specific signs of disease were associated with the presence of campylobacter before coy challenge in this study and no signs were seen in the uninfected control dog. Concurrent ccv/canine parvovirus infections have also been reported to induce severe disease (Tingpalapong et a11982, Appel 1988) .",

This may reflect the limited extent of viral replication in the gut mucosa demonstrated by low virus titre and PAP staining.

It may be possible for ccv to infect enterocytes and induce diarrhoea, without causing marked histological damage, by altering the brush border digestive enzyme system. However, as only a few enterocytes were shown to be infected in this study the actual cause of the diarrhoea cannot be explained. The use of canine small intestinal organ cultures may allow further investigation into the effect of ccv infection on mucosal biochemistry.",

Previous reports showed seroconversion by 21 days, but dogs were not tested earlier than this (Binn et al 1974 . The appearance of VN antibodies coincided appproximately with the cessation of virus excretion and the disappearance of clinical signs and may therefore have contributed to recovery. However, such antibodies may not have provided any immunity to reinfection.
