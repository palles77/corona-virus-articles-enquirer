            "text": "To study the generation of specific antibody responses within the central nervous system (CNS), we have utilized a murine model of acute viral encephalitis. When Sindbis virus (SV) is injected intracerebrally into weanling mice it causes an acute non-fatal encephalitis and recovery is primarily dependent on the development of antiviral antibody. We used a modified enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine the number of antibody-secreting cells (ASC) specific for SV and their Ig isotype in brain, spleen and cervical lymph nodes over the course of the acute encephalitis. The numbers of SV-specific ASC peak early in spleen and lymph nodes and then begin to increase in brain, suggesting that initial stimulation of B cells occurs primarily in peripheral lymphoid tissue followed by B cell entry into the circulation and appearance in the brain. The pattern for each individual isotype was similar with peak numbers of SV-specific cells present in the spleen 5-7 days after infection, while numbers in the brain continue to rise through day 20 when most ASC were secreting IgG2a or IgA SV-specific antibody. The data suggest therefore that most isotype switching from IgM to IgG and IgA occurs in peripheral lymphoid tissue. An exception to this pattern is IgG1, where numbers of ASC producing IgG1 do not show a peak in spleen and continue to rise in brain through the course of acute encephalitis. The data also indicate that early in infection a large proportion of ASC in the brain are not specific for SV and demonstrate that recruitment of ASC into the CNS is non-specific. However, the percentage of ASC that are specific for SV structural proteins rises steadily throughout the course of encephalitis suggesting that retention of ASC in the CNS is specific or that some portion of the SV-specific antibody response is generated within the CNS.",

During acute inflammation within the CNS, B cells appear in the brain. This may be due to selective homing, to non-specific recruitment during the inflammatory reaction or to selective recruitment. It is possible that up-regulation of adhesion molecules on the surfaces of endothelial cells and B cells (Springer, 1990) is sufficient for entry into the CNS (Cross et al., 1991) without regard for antigen specificity. During CNS infection initial activation and subsequent differentiation of B cells may occur locally or systemically through antigen stimulation and the elaboration of cytokines by T cells. Specific activation of antigen-relevant B cell clones and subsequent Ig isotype switching is facilitated by cognate interaction between B and T helper cells (Noelle and Snow, 1990) . It is not known whether this interaction occurs systemically in lymphoid organs or within the CNS during the inflammatory event.",

The immune response during SV encephalitis has been characterized and recovery from infection is primarily dependent on the development of antiviral antibody (Griffin and Johnson, 1977; Hirsch and Griffin, 1986; Stanley et al., 1986; Levine et al., 1991) . The majority of perivascular cells early in SV encephalitis are CD4 \u00f7 T cells, but at later stages macrophages and B cells become more prominent (Moench and Griffin, 1984) . We have previously demonstrated by immunoperoxidase staining in tissue sections that early in the infection the B cells in the perivascular inflammatory cuffs express IgM and IgD, but later most B cells express IgG (especially IgG2a) and IgA (Tyor et al., 1989) . The antigenic specificity of these B cells was not determined. In this study we have utilized a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (Sedgwick and Holt, 1983; Jones and Ada, 1986; Moskophidis et al., 1987; Sedgwick et al., 1990; Schwender et al., 1991; to determine the number of antibody-secreting cells (ASC) specific for SV and their Ig isotype expression in brain, spleen, and cervical lymph nodes over the course of acute encephalitis in mice.",

Dilutions were determined by performing the assay with different concentrations of brain, spleen, or lymph node mononuclear cells and establishing the optimal dilutions to allow blue spots (see below) to be counted accurately for SV-specific ASC and ASC secreting a specific isotype. The plates were washed with wash buffer, and rabbit anti-mouse IgM (1 : 500), IgA (1 : 250), IgG1 (1:500), IgG2a (1:250), IgG2b (1:250) or IgG3 (1:500) (ICN Immunobiologicals, Costa Mesa, CA) in PBS with 5% NGS was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0 . The wells were washed and goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Tago, Burlingame, CA), 1:500 in PBS with 5% NGS was incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0. Plates were washed and 2.3 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 0.6% agarose type I: low EEO (Sigma) was added, allowed to solidify and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0. For each animal, brain cells were diluted to 24 ml for total numbers of ASC secreting each Ig isotype and numbers of SV-specific ASC secreting each isotype. Three mice were studied at each time point (except day 3 had 4 mice). The same paradigm was used for spleen except wells had approximately 10 4 splenocytes for total ASC and 10 6 splenocytes for SV-specific ASC. All assays were performed in duplicate. Blue dots representing each ASC were counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and these numbers were averaged (2 wells per isotype; 3 or 4 mice per time point). For the cervical lymph nodes only IgM and IgG2a were assessed because of the limited numbers of ASC in these organs. The specificity of antisera for each Ig isotype was demonstrated with hybridoma cell lines secreting known Ig isotypes (Table 1 ). There was no cross-reactivity of the antisera used at the above concentrations and dilutions utilizing the modified enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay as described and the hybridoma lines listed in Table 1 . These were the same conditions used to analyze brain, spleen and lymph node ASC. Antibodies secreted by SV-specific ASC will only detect SV structural proteins (i.e. C, El, E2, 6K) in our assay and not non-structural proteins.",

This is consistent with previously reported data from our lab utilizing immunoperoxidase staining of tissue sections which indicated that early, B cells expressed IgM but later B cells expressing IgG2a and IgA predominate in the perivascular inflammatory cuffs (Tyor et al., 1989) . Similar studies of brain sections from outbred mice infected with Semliki Forest virus also found few IgGl-positive cells, but similar numbers of IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3positive cells were present by 21 days after infection. In this model, IgA and IgM were not examined (Parsons and Webb, 1992) . In chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection of mice (Moskophidis et al., 1987) and in coronavirus-induced encephalitis in rats (Schwender et al., 1991) , IgG-secreting virus-specific ASC also predominated late.",

These relationships are similar when one examines the isotype expression of SVspecific ASC. These populations also reflect the relationship between the brain, and the spleen and cervical lymph node ASC, that is apparent when one examines the total number of ASC in each of these locations. That is, in spleen and cervical lymph nodes SV-specific ASC secreting particular Ig isotypes peak at days 7 and 10, yet in brain the numbers of SV-specific ASC secreting IgG and IgA continue to rise through day 20. The exception is SV-specific ASC secreting IgM which decline after day 10. These data suggest that antigen presentation and subsequent stimulation of SV-specific B cell clones by CD4 \u00f7 T cells occurs first in spleen and cervical lymph nodes. Furthermore, isotype switching from lgM to IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3 or IgA probably also occurs primarily in the spleen and lymph nodes. The exception is IgG1. The number of ASC producing IgG1 continue to rise in brain through day 20 without a significant peak in spleen, suggesting that isotype switching to IgG1 may occur primarily in the brain. ASC secreting IgG2a are a predominant population of ASC in spleen, cervical lymph nodes and brain late in the course of SV encephalitis and IgG2a has previously been shown to be a prominent Ig isotype stimulated by viral infections in mice (Coutelier et al., 1988) .",

We found small numbers of ASC in brain parenchyma prior to infection, suggesting that trafficking into the brain by B cells takes place under normal conditions. Alternatively, these cells may have been participating in some unrecognized inflammatory condition. T cells which also traffick through the CNS under normal conditions (Wekerle et al., 1986) , are amongst the first inflammatory cells entering the CNS during SV encephalitis (Moench and Griffin, 1984) . Antigen-stimulation of CD4 \u00f7 ceils by class II \u00f7 macrophages and microglia may occur locally in the brain during SV encephalitis (Tyor et al., 1990) . The population of B cells already present in the brain prior to infection, as well as others entering during the course of encephalitis may represent B cells that are relatively immature (Tyor et al., 1989) , and therefore may have an opportunity, if they are SV-specific clones, to undergo stimulation and clonal expansion, entirely locally. However, as described above, examination of the time course suggests that the majority of stimulation probably occurs in peripheral lymphoid tissue.",

ASC that are specific for SV may interact with antigen and receive T cell help locally through cognate interactions while those ASC that are non-specific either do not expand or leave the brain. The ASC that are not specific for SV may return to peripheral lymphoid tissues such as the cervical lymph nodes (Oehmichen et al., 1979; Cserr and Knopf, 1992) via lymphatic drainage or return to the spleen and/or other peripheral lymphoid tissue by the hematogenous route.",
