Our model here is based on our model of this epidemic in [5] , which was focused on the early phase of this epidemic (January 20 through January 29) in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the early outbreak. During this early phase, the cumulative number of daily reported cases grew exponentially.

Soon after, the epidemic in Wuhan passed beyond the early exponential growth phase, to a phase with slowing growth. In this work, we assume that these major government measures caused the transmission rate to change from a constant rate to a time dependent exponentially decreasing rate. We identify this exponentially decreasing transmission rate based on reported case data after January 29. We then extend our model of the epidemic to the central region of China, where most cases occurred. Within just a few days after January 29, our model can be used to project the time-line of the model forward in time, with increasing accuracy, to a final size.",

For each of these time intervals, a value of \u00b5 is chosen so that the simulation for that time interval aligns with the cumulative reported case data in that interval. In this way, we are able to predict the future values of the epidemic from early cumulative reported case data. In Figure 5 we plot the graphs of the reported cases R(t), the unreported cases U (t), and the infectious pre-symptomatic cases I(t).

Our model transmission rate \u03c4 (t) can be modified to illustrate the effects of an earlier or later implementation of the major public policy interventions that occurred in this epidemic. The implementation one week earlier (25 is replaced by 18 in (4.1)) is graphed in Figure 6A . All other parameters and the initial conditions remain the same. The total reported cases is approximately 4, 500 and the total unreported cases is approximately 1, 100. The implementation one week later (25 is replaced by 32 in (4.1)) is graphed in Figure 6B . The total reported cases is approximately 820, 000 and the total unreported cases is approximately 200, 000. The timing of the institution of major social restrictions is critically important in mitigating the epidemic. The number of unreported cases is of major importance in understanding the evolution of an epidemic, and involves great difficulty in their estimation. The data from January 19 to February 15 for reported cases in Table 2 , was only for confirmed tested cases. Between February 11 and February 15, additional clinically diagnosed case data, based on medical imaging showing signs of pneumonia, was also reported by the Chinese CDC. Since February 16, only tested case data has been reported by the Chinese CDC, because new NHC guidelines removed the clinically diagnosed category. Thus, after February 15, there is a gap in the reported case data that we used up to February 15. The uncertainty of the number of unreported cases for this epidemic includes this gap, but goes even further to include additional unreported cases.",
