Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB, and Malaria are also run by men, and their senior leadership is male dominated. At WHO, less than 25% of senior management are women. Even the UN Special Advisor for Sustainable Development, who oversees the Every Woman Every Child movement, is male.",

Curiously, over the same 6-month period, the number of articles retrievable in PubMed that oppose predatory publishing has grown by 46\u00b75%, from 86 to 126, but this increase has not prevented predatory journals from continuing undisturbed.",

This issue deserves attention as these predatory journals can benefit from PubMed's massive popularity and achieve universal exposure while their largely low-quality articles can be cited in reputable journals, thus obtaining legitimacy and polluting scientific records.

Innovations coming out of African health-system reforms also provide answers to some of China's health-care problems; for example, the establishment of public-private partnerships and effective insurance schemes. Current challenges of communicable and non-communicable diseases can be surmounted through collective learning and action. The value of global partnership has been shown in situations of infectious disease prevention and management. The Ebola virus outbreak in west Africa in 2014 highlights the importance of strong health systems capable of timely and integrated responses. China faced similar challenges in 2003, with the outbreak of the SARS coronavirus. Researchers at HSPH and other US institutions have shown that pandemic control, in the context of the SARS and Ebola virus outbreaks, requires comprehensive and coordinated actions-eg, reduction of transmission through public health measures to increase public awareness and identification of vaccines. The continued engagement of academia will bolster the newly established Africa Centers for Disease Control-an initiative also supported by the China Centers for Disease Control and US Centers for Disease Control. 5 The sustainable development agenda calls for inclusive \"North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international\" partnerships that promote and enhance the capacity building of countries with low incomes and middle incomes. 6 CHAN is an example of the multifaceted cooperation required to push global health development forward in the 21st century.",
