We show that the PRRSV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) is the viral component responsible for modulation of IFN response. Nsp1 blocked dsRNA-induced IRF3 and IFN promoter activities. Nsp1 did not block phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 but inhibited IRF3 association with CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the nucleus. While IRF3 was stable, CBP was degraded, and CBP degradation was proteasome-dependent, suggesting that CBP degradation is not due to the protease activity of Nsp1 but an intermediary is involved. Our data suggest that the Nsp1-mediated CBP degradation inhibits the recruitment of CBP for enhanceosome assembly, leading to the block of IFN response. CBP degradation is a novel strategy for viral evasion from the host response, and Nsp1 may form a new class of viral antagonists for IFN modulation.",

PRRS was first recognized in 1987 in the U.S. and in Germany in 1990 independently (Keffaber 1989; Benfield et al., 1992) . PRRS quickly spread globally to most pigproducing countries and has become one of the most economically important diseases to the pork industry worldwide. Since its emergence, PRRS virus (PRRSV) has continued to evolve. A new type of PRRSV has recently been identified in the U.S. (Ropp et al., 2004; Fang et al., 2007) , and in 2006, a highly virulent PRRSV appeared in China Tong et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2008) which has spread to neighboring countries (Normile 2007; Feng et al., 2008; Kukushkin et al., 2008) .",

Studies show that PRRSV is highly susceptible to the action of type I IFNs in cells (Albina et al., 1998; Overend et al., 2007) , suggesting that the virus may function to inhibit IFN-\u03b1 response as this cytokine is not detectable in the lungs of pigs where PRRSV actively replicates by infecting alveolar macrophages (Buddaert et al., 1998; van Reeth et al., 1999; Luo et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2004) . The molecular basis for IFN suppression by PRRSV has not been studied but the involvement of NF-\u03baB has been excluded since it is up-regulated by the virus (Lee and Kleiboeker, 2005) . Impairment of IFN-\u03b1 production by PRRSV would affect the development of an effective T helper type 1 (Th1) response and lead to a weakly induced cellular response and consequently viral persistence in infected pigs, which would be of significant benefit to the virus. Different PRRSV isolates seem to have different abilities to induce or inhibit IFN-\u03b1 (Lee et al., 2004) , and this difference may be attributed to the genetic diversity of PRRSV. Although several lines of evidence suggest that PRRSV possesses immunosuppressive properties (Done and Paton, 1995; Drew, 2000; Jung et al., 2009) , the mechanism for virulence and persistence of PRRSV is yet unclear. It is postulated that at least one of the mechanisms may be related to the modulation of type I IFN production by PRRSV.",

            "text": "Viral infections lead to activation of several cellular transcription factors including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), to subsequently trigger the synthesis and secretion of IFN-\u03b2 (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008; Sadler and Williams, 2008; Takeuchi and Akira, 2008; Randall and Goodbourn, 2008; De Clercq, 2006; Pichlmair and Sousa, 2007) . Among those factors involved in type I IFN production, IRF3 plays a major role. IRF3 is constitutively expressed in most cell types and present in the cytoplasm in its inactive form. When stimulated, IRF3 becomes phosphorylated and undergoes conformational change, leading to dimerization and unveiling of the nuclear localization signal (NLS), and translocates to the nucleus where it forms a complex with the transcription co-activator CREB (cAMP responsive element binding)binding protein (CBP)/p300 (Lin et al., 1998; Dragan et al., 2007; Panne et al., 2007) . The IRF3-CBP/p300 complex in the nucleus then binds to target sequences including the positive regulatory domain (PRD) I-III regions of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and forms the assembly of basal transcription machinery and RNA polymerase II for IFN gene expression. Therefore, the transcriptional activity of IRF3 is entirely dependent on its association with CBP/p300 co-activators. Once IFN is expressed, it is extracellularly secreted and binds to IFN receptors on the cell membrane, which subsequently triggers the IFN signaling cascade through Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated signal transducers and activators of the transcription (STAT) pathway. This series of IFN pathways regulate the expression of more than a hundred IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are mostly related to innate immunity and thus specify the antiviral state of the host. In turn, many viruses have evolved to prevent the production of type I IFN for their survival in the host, and ample examples are available (for reviews, see Koyama et al., 2008; Randall and Goodbourn, 2008; Pichlmair and Sousa, 2007) .",

            "text": "PRRSV is a porcine arterivirus belonging to the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales. PRRSVs in North America and Europe share only 55-80% of sequence identity in the different viral genes and thus form two distinct genotypes (Meng et al., 1995) . The viral genome is a positive-sense RNA of approximately 15 kb in size and contains 9 ORFs: ORF1a and ORF1b code for two large non-structural polyproteins (PP1a and PP1ab), and ORF2a, ORF2b, and ORF3 through ORF7 code for structural proteins E (small envelope), GP2 (glycoprotein 2), GP3, GP4, GP5, M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid), respectively (Wootton et al., 2000; Meulenberg et al., 1993) . The ORF1a product (PP1a) is 2503 amino acids long, while ORF1b is expressed through ribosomal frameshifting to generate an ORF1ab fusion protein (PP1ab) of 3960 amino acids (den Boon et al., 1991; Wootton et al., 2000) . For PRRSV, PP1a and PP1ab are co-translationally processed to 13 proteolytic cleavage products; Nsp1\u03b1, Nsp1\u03b2, and Nsp2 through Nsp12 in order from the N-terminus (Wassenaar et al., 1997; Snijder et al., 1992; Snijder et al., 1994; Snijder et al., 1995) . Therefore, Nsp1 is the first viral protein synthesized in cells upon infection. Nsp1 is a 382-amino acid protein and contains two papainlike cysteine proteinase (PCP) domains, designated PCP\u03b1 and PCP\u03b2 . The protease activity of PCP\u03b1 has been predicted to be responsible for generation of Nsp1\u03b1, and the PCP\u03b2 activity generates Nsp1\u03b2 by cleaving it from Nsp2 during the PP1a/PP1ab synthesis (den Boon et al., 1995) . After cleavage of Nsp1, no trans-cleavage protease activity is observed for Nsp1 and therefore its enzymatic activity seems to be no longer functional in equine arteritis virus (EAV). PCP\u03b1 activity seems to be required for subgenomic mRNA synthesis but is not involved in viral genome replication (Kroese et al., 2008) . A zinc finger motif is found in the N-terminal region of Nsp1\u03b1, and this motif along with PCP\u03b1 activity is required for transactivation of subgenomic RNA synthesis (Tijms and Snijder, 2003; Tijms et al., 2001; Tijms et al., 2007) . In EAV, Nsp1\u03b1 is not cleaved from Nsp1\u03b2 and has been observed to localize in the nucleus (Tijms et al., 2002) . Similarly, PRRSV Nsp1 protein has also been observed to localize in the nucleus in addition to the cytoplasmic distribution (unpublished observation). Since PRRSV is a cytoplasmic RNA virus that does not require the nuclear function of the host cell for replication and because Nsp1 is observed in the nucleus, it has prompted us to examine the role of Nsp1 for IFN modulation. In the present study, we investigated the basis for IFN regulation by PRRSV and determined Nsp1 as the responsible protein for IFN down-regulation. PRRSV Nsp1 induced CBP degradation and interrupted the IRF3 binding to CBP, which in turn resulted in IFN down-regulation. Our study shows a novel function of the Nsp1 protein during PRRSV infection and provides new insight into the immune modulation and evasion strategy of this virus.",

MARC-145 cells were first infected with PRRSV and then stimulated with poly(I:C), followed by total cellular RNA extraction for real-time RT-PCR. While IFN-\u03b1 is effectively induced in response to poly(I:C) (13), infection with PRRSV suppressed the poly(I:C)-induced IFN-\u03b1 mRNA production in MARC-145 cells (Fig. 1A ). In parallel with the quantitative measurements for IFN-\u03b1 mRNA, reduced production of IFN by PRRSV was confirmed by IFN bioassays using VSV-GFP. VSV is exceptionally sensitive to IFNs and thus is commonly used in assays for IFN-mediated antiviral activities, while Sendai virus is used as an effective inducer of type I IFN. Dulac PK cells were incubated first with cell culture supernatants, collected from PRRSV and Sendai virusinfected PAMs then UV-irradiated. The Dulac PK cells were then infected with VSV-GFP and the VSV infectivity was determined by monitoring the levels of GFP expression. VSV-GFP grew normally in PRRSV-uninfected and Sendai virus-uninfected cells and produced fluorescence at a low dilution of the supernatant (Fig. 1B , upper panels). Sendai virus infection inhibited VSV replication effectively, and no visible GFP expression was identified up to 1:8 dilution of the culture supernatant (middle panels), showing efficient production of IFN in alveolar macrophages. In contrast, infection of cells with PRRSV did not inhibit VSV replication and GFP expression was evident even at low dilutions (lower panels).",

Among these transcription factors, IRF3 plays a major role in IFN-\u03b2 gene expression. PRRSV infection activates the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway through I\u03baB degradation and the upregulation of MMP (matrix metalloproteinase)-2 and MMP-9 expressions (Lee and Kleiboeker, 2005) , suggesting that PRRSV-induced IFN down-regulation may likely involve the IRF3 pathway rather than the NF-\u03baB pathway. To examine the role of IRF3 during PRRSV infection, a luciferase assay was conducted using the 4xIRF3-Luc reporter construct (Ehrhardt et al., 2004) . This construct contains 4 copies of the IRF3 responsive PRDI/III region of the IFN-\u03b2 enhanceosome coupled with luciferase, and thus IFN-\u03b2 expression could be determined using 4xIRF3- Total cellular RNA was extracted and cDNA was prepared using both IFN-\u03b1 and GAPDH reverse primers. Messenger RNA levels of indicated genes were normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA. Normalized values obtained from each infection and transfection were averaged. This data represents two separate experiments in duplicate. (B) IFN bioassay for PRRSV using VSV-GFP. Porcine alveolar macrophages were infected with PRRSV for 48 h and supernatants were collected for IFN bioassay. Sendai virus was used as an IFN stimulator. The supernatants were UV-irradiated for 30 min under a 75 W UV lamp at a 33 cm distance prior to assay. Dulac porcine kidney cells were grown in 96 well plates and incubated with 2-fold diluted samples for 24 h.

At 24 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated with 0.5 \u03bcg of poly (I:C) for 15 h and the luciferase activities were measured using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega).

When stimulated, IRF3 is phosphorylated by an upstream kinase and homodimerized in the cytoplasm for translocation to the nucleus. Some viruses have evolved to interfere with the IRF3 pathway and inhibit the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Common mechanisms used by these viruses include degradation of IRF3, inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation, inhibition of IRF3 nuclear translocation, or inhibition of transcription complex assembly. We first examined if IRF3 phosphorylation was blocked by PRRSV. The poly(I:C) stimulation triggered the phosphorylation of IRF3 in both MARC-145 cells ( To further determine the basis of modulation of IRF3 activity by Nsp1, nuclear translocation of IRF3 was examined by immunofluorescence. PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells were stimulated with poly (I:C), and the endogenous IRF3 was stained with specific antibody (Fig. 4A ). While IRF3 was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm with some nuclear diffusion in the absence of stimulation (panels A, C), IRF3 was predominantly translocated to the nucleus after poly(I:C) stimulation (panels D, F). PRRSV-infected cells were identified by the staining of N protein (panel G), and PRRSV infection followed by poly (I:C) stimulation did not block the nuclear translocation of IRF3 (panels H, J), supporting the efficient phosphorylation of IRF3 even in the presence of Nsp1. These results suggest that Nsp1-mediated suppression of both IRF3 activation and IFN production occurs further downstream of the IRF3 nuclear translocation. The nuclear localization of IRF3 was also examined in pCMV-Flag-Nsp1 transfected cells (Fig. 4B) . As with MARC-145 cells, HeLa cells showed the efficient translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus upon poly(I:C) stimulation (panels A, C), and the nuclear translocation of IRF3 was not blocked by the Nsp1 protein (panels H, J), as the Nsp1 expression in the same cell was verified by anti-Flag antibody (panel G).",

This complex then binds to PRD I/III of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter for transcription activation and IFN production. Since Nsp1 did not alter IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, Nsp1 was hypothesized to play a role during assembly of IRF3 with CBP/p300 for transcriptional complex formation in the nucleus. To examine the role of Nsp1 in IRF3 association with CBP, co-immunoprecipitation was conducted for PRRSV-infected cells (Fig. 6A ) and pCMV-Flag-Nsp1 transfected cells (Fig. 6B ). MARC-145 cells were infected with PRRSV for 24 h and stimulated with poly(I:C). Cell lysates were then prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an IRF3specific antibody. The immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using the CBP antibody. While the association of IRF3 with CBP was evident in cells stimulated with poly (I:C) (Fig. 6A, top panel, lane 2) , this association decreased in virusinfected poly(I:C)-stimulated cells (top panel, lane 3). In these cells, both Nsp1\u03b1 and Nsp1\u03b2 subunits were readily detectable as 20 kD and 28 kD proteins (panel 4, arrows), respectively, and CBP association with IRF3 was significantly reduced. In HeLa cells transfected with pCMV-Flag-Nsp1, the amount of CBP associated with IRF3 also decreased significantly by Nsp1 protein (Fig. 6B, top panel, lane 3) , whereas detectable levels of IRF3 remained unchanged (second panel, lane 3). In unstimulated cells, CBP was detectable in negligible amounts (top panel, lane 1), most likely because IRF3 would not be activated without poly(I:C) stimulation, thus resulting in the failure of CBP recruitment by IRF3.",

Host cells produce cytokines and chemokines in response to viral infection and among such effector molecules, type I IFNs are the principal antiviral cytokines and are therefore effective targets for viruses to disarm host surveillance (Koyama et al., 2008; Randall and Goodbourn, 2008; Pichlmair and Sousa, 2007) . Type I IFNs can be produced by virtually all nucleated cells, in contrast to type II IFN which is exclusively produced by T and natural killer (NK) cells. Many viruses including small RNA viruses are known to express proteins that counteract the production of type I IFN and such viral proteins are often multifunctional. Many examples of different evasion strategies are available for different RNA viruses, and IFN-antagonizing viral proteins include NS1 protein of influenza virus (Min et al., 2007) , V protein of paramyxoviruses (Andrejeva et al., 2004) , sigma 3 of reoviruses (Jacobs and Langland, 1998) , NSP1 of rotavirus (Graff et al., 2007) , P protein of rabies virus (Brzozka et al., 2005) (Luquin et al., 2007) , G1 protein of hantavirus, and Nsp1 and ORF6 proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Davaraj 2007; Wathelet et al., 2007; Frieman et al., 2007) to name a few. These proteins function to circumvent the IFN response by interfering with host cell gene expression, blocking the IFN induction cascade, or inhibiting the IFN signaling pathways. IRF3 is a key element for the induction of the early antiviral response and is therefore an ideal target by many viruses in modulating the IFN response.",

            "text": "In the present study, we have shown that PRRSV Nsp1 is an IFNantagonizing protein. Nsp1 appears to inhibit the 4xIRF3 and IFN-\u03b2 promoter activities and reduce IFN production. Since Nsp1 is a cysteine protease, degradation of IRF3 was initially hypothesized as the mechanism for IFN down-regulation by PRRSV. It is striking however, that PRRSV Nsp1 appears to inhibit the recruitment of CBP by IRF3 in the nucleus via CBP degradation. For full activation of IRF3, the phosphorylated and dimerized form of IRF3 recruits co-activator CBP/p300 in the nucleus, which directs the complex to bind to IRF3 responsive elements for transcription initiation (Yang et al., 2004; Suhara et al., 2002) . PRRSV Nsp1 does not appear to modify IRF3 phosphorylation or to block IRF3 nuclear translocation but rather degrades CBP in the nucleus (Fig. 6) . By degrading CBP, Nsp1 seems to block the full activation of IRF3 and subsequently inhibit the assembly of IFN enhanceosome.",

            "text": "During the preparation of this manuscript, Beura et al. (2010) reported that, by using individual subunit constructs of Nsp1, Nsp1\u03b2 inhibited IRF3 nuclear translocation and down-regulated IFN\u03b2 promoter activity. While it is unknown which subunit of Nsp1 is responsible for CBP degradation in our study, Beura's report contradicts our finding that Nsp1 did not block nuclear localization of IRF3 (Figs. 4, A and B, and 5) . Recently, Sun et al. (2009) determined and reported the three-dimensional structure of the Nsp1\u03b1 subunit of Nsp1 by X-ray crystallographic studies. In their study, the self-cleavage site for Nsp1\u03b1 was precisely located at Cys-Ala-Met180/Ala181-Asp-Val to yield Nsp1\u03b1 of 180 amino acids and Nsp1\u03b2 of 202 amino acids. This finding overturns the previous prediction of Nsp1\u03b1 cleavage at Q166/R/167 (den Boon et al., 1995) , and shows that the naturally cleaved Nsp1\u03b1 subunit is 14-amino acids extended at the C-terminus and thus Nsp1\u03b2 is 14 amino acids shorter at its N-terminus when compared to the previously predicted cleavage products. Furthermore, this study identified the second zinc finger configuration in the Cterminal region of Nsp1\u03b1 to hold a Zn ++ ion, in addition to the first zinc finger present in the N-terminal region of Nsp1\u03b1, and the involvement of Met180 in the second zinc finger configuration, suggesting an important biological function be associated with the newly identified zinc finger structure. In support of this argument, Chen et al. (2010) has also recently identified the precise cleavage site of Nsp1\u03b1 to be Cys-Ala-M180/Ala181-Thr-Val by peptide sequencing of two Nsp1 autocleavage products of the North American type II PRRSV SD23938. Therefore, it is conceivable that the recent report described by Beura et al. (2010) in contrast to our finding may be attributed to the lack of the zinc finger structure in Nsp1\u03b1 and thus the N-terminal extension of the Nsp1\u03b2 portion in their constructs. In our current study, the full-length Nsp1 gene for 382 amino acids was used throughout the experiments and thus the natural cleavage at Met180/Ala181 would be anticipated to yield two authentic cleavage products of Nsp1\u03b1 and Nsp1\u03b2. Further studies will warrant the functional contribution of the newly identified zinc finger structure in Nsp1 to its biological significance.",

            "text": "The degradation of CBP is an uncommon yet a novel strategy of viruses for IFN modulation. Thogoto virus, an orthomyxovirus, has recently been studied for IFN suppression, and the Thogoto virus ML protein, which is a homolog of the influenza virus NS1 protein, has been found to interfere with IRF3 function. The ML protein however did not block the nuclear transport of IRF3 but inhibited the association of IRF3 with CBP (Jennings et al., 2005) . This result resembles our finding on the function of Nsp1. CBP possesses histone acetyltransferase activity and dissociates histones for chromatin relaxation in the promoter region. The CBP/p300 co-activators function in concert with a variety of transcription factors including c-Myb, p53, STATs, NF-\u03baB, PIAS1, and the IRF family (Barlev et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2000; Ma et al., 2005; Oelgeschl\u00e4ger et al., 1996; Yin et al., 2005; Zhong et al., 2002) . Therefore, CBP acts as an important regulator for many cellular processes. The question arises then whether Nsp1 interferes with general cellular transcription. The Thogoto virus ML protein has recently been shown to interact with the RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIB (TFIIB; Vogt et al., 2008) . However, the ML protein-TFIIB interaction had surprisingly little effects on host cell gene expression in general, but showed a strong negative impact on the IRF3-regulated and NF-\u03baB-regulated promoters (Vogt et al., 2008) . Thus, it is conceivable that PRRSV Nsp1-mediated CBP degradation may also be negligible for general cellular transcription but have a more specific and potent role for IRF3-regulated IFN induction. The PRRSV Nsp1 protein and the Thogoto virus ML protein may constitute a new class of viral antagonists for IFN regulation acting to target CBP degradation.",

CBP degradation was halted in the presence of MG132, a potent inhibitor of the proteasome, thereby suggesting proteasome involvement in CBP degradation by Nsp1. As with PRRSV Nsp1, pestivirus N pro is a papain- like cysteine protease (PCP) and down-regulates IFN production through IRF3 degradation via the proteasome-dependent pathway Gil et al., 2006) . Similarly, NSP1-mediated IRF3 degradation in rotavirus is also proteasome-dependent (Graff et al., 2002) . Proteins targeted by proteasomes are degraded through polyubiquitination. CBP/p300 degradation requires Mdm2 (murine double minute 2) acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in the presence of activated Ras (Sanchez-Molina et al., 2006) , and it is therefore possible that Nsp1 may also bring CBP to an E3 ligase complex by which CBP is polyubiquitinated for subsequent degradation. In eukaryotes, the proteasomes reside in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Peters et al., 1994) . In order for PRRSV Nsp1 to degrade CBP in the nucleus, Nsp1 must localize in the nucleus although PRRSV replicates in the cytoplasm. The Nsp1 protein of equine arteritis virus (EAV), another member of the Arteriviridae family, has been reported to localize in the nucleus (Tijms et al., 2002) , and our studies also indicate that PRRSV Nsp1 is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in virus-infected cells as well as in Nsp1 gene-transfected cells (Fig. 4B, panel G) . Therefore, it seems that Nsp1 triggers E3 ubiquitination of CBP by yet-to-be-identified mechanisms, and subsequently degrades it via the proteasome-dependent pathway. The PRRSV Nsp1 protein contains a zinc finger motif of CxC-(14)-CxxC in the Nsp1\u03b1 subunit. Pestivirus N pro also contains a zinc-binding TRASH motif (Ettema et al., 2003) and this motif has been shown to be required for IRF3 degradation in the regulation of IFN (Szymanski et al., 2009) . It is of interest to examine whether the zinc finger motif in PRRSV Nsp1 also regulates CBP degradation and IFN response, and such studies are currently in progress.",
