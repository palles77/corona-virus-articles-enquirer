            "text": "It was previously reported that up-regulation of \u2423-enolase protein was detected in 65% of patients with non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Moreover, a high titer of anti-\u2423enolase antibodies was developed in a smaller proportion (7.4%) of these patients than in non-tumor-associated patients and healthy subjects. In the present study, we characterized polyclonal and single-chain variable fragment (scFv) anti-\u2423-enolase antibodies from immunized chickens. The E. coli-derived recombinant \u2423-enolase protein was purified to its high homogenicity as verified by SDS-PAGE. After the 4th immunization, a high titer of specific polyclonal anti-\u2423-enolase antibodies was elicited in immunized chickens and specifically recognized the purified human \u2423-enolase antigen as determined by Western blot and ELISA. The expressed heavy and light chain variable genes (VH and VL) were isolated from spleen B cells and amplified to construct phage antibody libraries containing scFv molecules. After four rounds of panning selection, the scFv antibodies of randomly chosen clones were expressed and their binding specificity to \u2423-enolase protein was verified using competitive ELISA, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Nucleotide sequence analysis from 10 \u2423-enolase binding clones showed that 3 (30%) clones used identical heavy and light genes for scFv antibody expression, as represented by EnL5. Notably, amino acid changes in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) were more frequently observed than those in framework regions (FRs) in all clones, indicating a strong affinity selection through mutations. All together, it is believed that these polyclonal and scFv IgY antibodies may be helpful in the development of molecular diagnostic and therapeutic agents for lung cancers in the future.",

            "text": "Enolase was originally characterized as an enzyme involved in glycolytic metabolism catalyzing the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate into phosphoenolpyruvate. In mammals, there are three isoforms of enolase, called \u2423-ENO1, \u2424-ENO3 and \u2425-ENO2 (Redlitz et al., 1995) . The \u2423-enolase is a major form of enolase present in the early stages of embryonic development; it is expressed ubiquitously in various types of tissue, whereas \u2425-ENO2 and \u2424-ENO3 are exclusively found in neuron and muscle cells (Antikainen et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2006) . By using an alternative translation start codon, ENO1 can be translated into c-myc promoter binding protein 1 (MBP-1), which is preferentially localized in cell nuclei (Feo et al., 2000) . Both ENO1 and MBP-1 proteins are known to be negative regulators for c-myc expression.",

In addition to its glycolytic function, \u2423-enolase has been found to play an important role in several biological and pathophysiological processes (Sirover, 1996 (Sirover, , 1999 . In particular, several studies have found \u2423-enolase to play important roles in tumorigenesis. For example, Redlitz et al. (1995) found \u2423-enolase on the cell surface, functioning as one of the plasminogen receptors which may play a role in tumor invasion. Up-regulation of \u2423-enolase has also been reported in several highly tumorigenic or metastatic cell lines (Chang et al., 2006; Ito et al., 2007; Peebles et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2000) . \u2423-Enolase over-expression has been correlated with tumorigenicity in several types of cancer, which suggests its pathophysiologic role in cancer formation (Altenberg and Greulich, 2004) . Furthermore, an autoantigen of \u2423enolase was identified in non-small cell lung cancer and its over-expression was highly correlated with poor survival outcomes (Chang et al., 2006) . In addition to its roles in cancer, \u2423-enolase has been implicated in numerous diseases, including autoimmune disorders, ischaemia and bacterial infection (Antikainen et al., 2007; Bogdanos et al., 2004; Gitlits et al., 2001; Jiang et al., 1997; Kinloch et al., 2005; Saulot et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Generation of monoclonal antibodies with high specificity to various target antigens through traditional hybridoma technology is an expensive and tedious process (Groves and Morris, 2000) . In recent years, a phage display system which is more cost and time effective involving the in vitro cloning of antibody heavy and light genes, has been extensively used to identify and isolate monoclonal antibodies from recombinant antibody repertories (Barbas et al., 1991; Winter et al., 1994) . Smaller recombinant engineered antibody fragments, e.g. antigenbinding fragment (Fab) or single-chain variable fragment (scFv), are now emerging as new applications in diagnosis and therapy for the biotechnology market. ScFv molecules in which the VH and VL domains are joined with a flexible polypeptide linker usually retain the specific, monovalent antigen-binding affinity of the parent IgG, while showing improved pharmacokinetics for tissue penetration (Holliger and Hudson, 2005) . Among all the animals suitable for antigen immunization, domestic chicken is the most feasible and available host for scFv antibody library construction to screen efficient binders against various pathogen infections for diagnostic applications (Fehrsen et al., 2005; Finlay et al., 2006; Park et al., 2005) . From the aforementioned studies, \u2423-enolase might serve as a potential target for diagnostic or therapeutic application clinically. Accordingly, in the present study, we generated and characterized the anti-\u2423-enolase polyclonal IgY antibodies in chicken and monoclonal scFv antibodies by a phage display system using ELISA, Western blotting, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining.",

The PE089 cell line was originally obtained from effusion tumor cells of a 36-year-old patient with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, which was kindly provided by Dr. Neng-Yao Shih from National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Tainan, Taiwan. The resultant PCR fragment was cloned into the pGEX-KG vector at EcoRI and NcoI sites and transformed into the E. coli BL-21 (DE3) strain for expression. The gene was also subcloned into the pET21a vector using 5 -CCGCGTGAATTCGGGGATCCATGTCTATTCTCAAGATCC-3 (forward) and 5 -CATGGAGTCGACCTCGAGCTTGGCCAAGG-GGTTTCTG-3 (reverse) primers and expressed as Hisfused \u2423-enolase. Individual clones were grown in 5 ml LB medium containing ampicillin (100 g/ml) at 37 \u2022 C overnight. The bacterial culture was diluted 10-fold in the same LB medium and further grown until the OD 600 reached between 0.6 and 1.0. To induce GST-fused or His-fused \u2423-enolase protein expression, isopropyl-\u2424d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM in the culture. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 2 ml of 1\u00d7 PBS containing 1% Triton x-100 and lysed by three cycles of freezing (\u221270 \u2022 C) and thawing (37 \u2022 C).

Two hundred milligrams of spleen were homogenized in liquid nitrogen and placed in 2 ml Trizol solution for RNA extraction using the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, USA). Ten micrograms of total RNA was reversely transcribed into the first-strand cDNA using a Super-Script RT kit (Invitrogen, USA). After amplification using chicken-specific primers (Andris-Widhopf et al., 2000) , PCR products of heavy and light chain variable (VH and VL) regions were subjected to a second round of PCR with a short-or long-linker (Andris-Widhopf et al., 2000) to form full-length scFv fragments, which were further digested with SfiI and cloned into the pComb3X vector. Recombinant DNAs were transformed into E. coli XL-1 blue strain by electroporation. Recombinant phage production was initiated by the addition of VCS-M13 helper phage, precipitated with 4% polyethylglycol 8000 and 3% NaCl (w/v), and finally resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and stored at 4 \u2022 C. Then, 10 11 plaque-forming units (pfu) of recombinant phages from the scFv antibody library were added to wells precoated with \u2423-enolase protein (0.5 g/well), and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 2 h. After removing unbound phages, bound phages were eluted with 0.1 M HCl/glycine (pH 2.2)/0.1% BSA, neutralized with 2 M Tris base buffer and used to infect the XL-1 blue strain. The amplified phages were precipitated and recovered as described above for the next round of selection. The panning procedure was repeated three or four times. A panel of clones were randomly selected and grown from the final panning process. After 0.5 mM IPTG induction for 6 h, bacterial cells were collected and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing and/or sonication. The supernatants were analyzed for their scFv antibody expression and binding reactivity to \u2423-enolase using Western blotting and ELISA. ScFv antibodies expressed in TOP 10F E. coli (Invitrogen, a nonsuppressor strain) and purified using Ni 2+ -charged sepharose as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, UK) were also prepared in flow cytometric and immunofluoresence analyses.",

We did not detect any scFv antibodies expressed in clone EnL8 or EnL10 under identical conditions.
