Moreover, the concentration of IFN-c was significantly higher in the effusions than in the serum of cats with FIP, probably due to IFN-c production within lesions. These findings support the hypothesis that there is a strong, 'systemic' cell mediated immune response in clinically normal, FCoV-infected cats and that a similar process, albeit at a tissue level, is involved in the pathogenesis of FIP.",

Frequent FCoV cross-infection and FCoV mutation are likely in catteries with a high prevalence of FIP. Although the time of such 'field' infection cannot be determined precisely, cats such as those in subgroup B1 are thought to experience continuous re-infection according to the infection model proposed by Foley et al. (1997) . Cats from such catteries are likely to be resistant to developing FIP. In the present study, subgroup B1 cats did not have evidence of FIP, and their higher serum IFN-c concentrations compared with subgroup B2 animals may be linked to their continuous re-infection with FCoV. Increased expression of this cytokine by PBLs (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Kiss et al., 2004) or increased numbers of IFN-c-producing lymphocytes in blood and lymph nodes, as reported in cats living in FCoV-endemic catteries may explain the higher serum IFN-c concentrations in this group (Kipar et al., 2001; Paltrinieri et al., 2003; De Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) .",

Although the authors were unable to find published data concerning IFN-c levels in the effusions of cats with which to compare, IFN-c concentrations in the effusions of cats with FIP were 40-fold higher than the serum concentrations of this cytokine in the same animals. This suggests that the IFN-c present in the effusions is produced by cells within FIP lesions, as reported by Berg et al. (2005) .",
