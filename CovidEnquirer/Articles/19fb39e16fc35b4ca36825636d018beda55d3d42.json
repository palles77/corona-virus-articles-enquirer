            "text": "Microbial screening -Immunological and PCR based assays All secretions were initially tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using immunological tests including Immunofluorescence or membrane ELISA. As only 36% of the samples collected in the RSV season tested positive, we additionally tested them for a range of viral and bacterial pathogens (see methods). The full results are available upon request. Briefly, the extensive PCR testing revealed that ~46% of the secretions tested positive for RSV, ~20% for various picornaviruses and smaller proportions of a range of other respiratory pathogens (Supplementary Table S1 ). In 75% of secretions a pathogen was found, where in 20% of the samples more than one pathogen was identified. A summary of detected viral and bacterial pathogens using PCRbased-assays in children with one or multiple infections is listed in Supplementary Table S2 . With the exception HPIV4, all viruses identified using deep sequencing in this study had been previously screened using hybridization-based methods (Supplementary Table S1 ). Despite the increased sensitivity of PCR based assays, these results emphasize the limitations of PCR based identification of microbial pathogens in the public health setting. The largest proportion of humanvirus-sequences identified (61%) was taxonomically classified as HPIV4, with most sequences predominating from one high titer sample. The second largest portion of human-virus-reads derived from human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (19%), which also predominately originated from one specimen. All identified coronavirus sequences were identified as the OC43 strain, accounting for 7% of the sequence reads. Finally, small subsets of reads to four known respiratory viruses were identified in some samples, including influenza A (n=1), human parainfluenza virus 3 (n=1), adenovirus (n=2) and human rhinovirus (n=3), two of which mapped to the recently proposed type C species 9 . Efforts in characterizing the HRV-C genomes are currently ongoing.",

In order to fill the diagnostic gap, 92 'negative' nasopharyngeal or tracheal specimens were processed further, using an in-house metagenomic high-throughput sequencing pipeline for viral detection. The specimens were initially enriched for viral particles using a combination of nuclease treatment and filtration, and then amplified using random RT-PCR-based amplification 1, 2 . Pooled pyrosequenced PCR products generated a total of 851,591 sequence reads with an average read length of 229 nucleotides (nt). In order to reduce the complexity of the metagenomic data, all recovered sequences were filtered using BLAT sequence similarity searches to local ribosomal and human databases, in effect leaving 424,488 sequence reads (49.8%) for further analysis. The taxonomic identification of viral sequences followed, with all filtered reads being mapped to the European Bioinformatic Institute's (EBI) database of virus and phage genomes. An overview of the recovered viral sequences can be seen in SupplementaryFigure S1.A total of 58% of viral reads were taxonomically identified to be associated with infections in humans, with approximately 19% and 21% of the remaining sequences being classified as either 'phage' or 'other' respectively. The majority of the reads within the 'other' category were identified as viruses infecting invertebrates and plants. We postulate that these sequences derive from either trace contamination (most likely from sampling or laboratory reagents) or taxonomically ambiguous identification of low complexity regions, as various other studies have reported similar findings[3][4][5] . Interestingly, a number of low abundance reads were identified as Mimiviridae-like sequences in four respiratory samples. Mimivirus is currently one of the largest viruses discovered, and infects the free-living amoeba Acanthamoeba polyphaga. Its status and role as a",

A summary of samples positive for HPIV4 using the real-time PCR assay (SupplementaryTable S4) indicates that the virus was detected alone as well as in co-infections with other viruses. Two children positive for HPIV4 were also infected with three other viral pathogens known to cause upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections.
