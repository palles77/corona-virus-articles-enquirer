Gene 3b has a postulated role in pathogenesis, but its truncated form in some laboratory-passaged strains of TGEV has led to the suggestion that it is not essential for virus replication. During synthesis in vitro in the presence of microsomes, the 27.7-kDa polypeptide became an integral membrane protein, retained its postulated hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequence, and underwent glycosylation on apparently two asparagine linkage sites to attain a final molecular mass of 31 kDa. A 20-kDa N-terminally truncated, nonglycosylated, nonanchored form of the protein was also made via an unknown mechanism. The existence of both transmembrane and soluble forms of the gene 3 product in the cell is suggested by immunofluorescence patterns showing both a punctated perinuclear and diffuse intracytoplasmic distribution. No gene 3b product was found on gradient-purified Purdue TGEV by a Western blotting procedure that would have detected as few as 4 molecules/virion, indicating the protein probably is not a structural component of the virion.",

Depending on the strain of virus, mortality rates in young pigs may reach 100%. One possible explanation for differences in pathogenicity has come from studies by Wesley et al. (1990) in which there was noted a concordance between the integrity of genes 3a and 3b (as defined by their coding regions), located between gene 2 (the spike [S] gene) and gene 4 [the envelope protein (E) gene] (Godet et al., 1992) , and virulence among variants of the pathogenic Miller strain (Fig. 1) . Genes 3a and 3b, so named because of their location within the 5\u0408 proximal unique region of mRNA 3 in the Purdue strain of TGEV, potentially encode proteins of 7.7 and 27.7 kDa, respectively (Cavanagh et al., 1990; Kapke et al., 1988a; Rasschaert et al., 1987) (Fig. 1) . Genes 3a and 3b are both uninterrupted in the nonpathogenic Purdue 116 strain of TGEV (Kapke et al., 1988a) , however, suggesting there may be factors other than the integrity of these genes contributing to pathogenic differences.",

A major protein product of 27.7 kDa and a minor product of 20 kDa were routinely observed when transcripts were translated in either wheat germ lysate (Fig. 4A , lane 2) or rabbit reticulocyte lysate (data not shown). At no time were products of the size expected from gene 4 (9.2 kDa; Godet et al., 1992) or from the truncated M gene (11 kDa; Kapke et al., 1988b) observed. The 27.7-kDa protein is the presumed fulllength product of gene 3b. The 20-kDa protein was concluded on the basis of the following observations to be an N-terminally truncated product of gene 3b resulting from either initiation of translation at methionine position 80, 86, or 92 or a proteolytic cleavage at a site downstream of aa 75: (1) the 20-kDa protein was synthesized from transcripts of plasmid pORF2 linearized with NsiI or AvrII, which cut close to the 3\u0408 end of gene 3b, but not with BsrGI or NdeI, which cut within gene 3b ( Fig. 3 and data not shown). (2) The 27.7-kDa protein, but not the 20-kDa protein, was radiolabeled with 35 S-cysteine, which occurs only at position 75 (Fig. 2B) . (3) The 20-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated with 27.7-kDa proteinspecific antiserum (described below). No differences in the migration rates of either the 27.7-or 20-kDa species were observed when electrophoresis was carried out in the absence of \u2424-mercaptoethanol, indicating that neither species contained intramolecular disulfide linkages or were themselves disulfide-linked multimeric forms (data not shown).",

As shown in Fig. 4A , lane 3, translation in the presence of microsomes yielded a product of 31 kDa, in addition to the 27-and 20-kDa species, that was not made in the absence of microsomes (Fig. 4A, lane 2) . In some experiments, minor amounts of a 29-kDa species were also observed (data not shown). Because core glycosylation typically contrib- utes 1.5-3 kDa/carbohydrate chain (Viitala et al., 1988) and because only one potential asparagine linkage site is present in the deduced 20-kDa protein sequence, it is likely that only the 27.7-kDa species had undergone translocation and glycosylation. This conclusion is supported by an analysis of pelleted intact microsomes from a translation reaction mix in which only the 31-kDa species and some of the 27.7-kDa species, but none of the 20-kDa species, were found (Fig. 4A, lane 6) . The supernatant fraction from this procedure contained the 27.7and 20-kDa species (Fig. 4A, lane 7) . Glycosylation, furthermore, probably occurs only on the two upstream potential glycosylation sites because only these would be accessible on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum based on the deduced topography of the 31-kDa protein (discussed below).",

When microsomes from a translation reaction were opened by carbonate treatment and pelleted, the 31-kDa glycoprotein was found almost exclusively in the pellet (Fig. 4A , lane 4), demonstrating its anchorage in the membrane.

            "text": "To determine the topography of the 31-kDa protein, microsomes from a completed translation reaction were incubated with a mixture of trypsin (which hydrolyses the carboxyl group of arginine and lysine) and chymotrypsin (which hydrolyses the carboxyl group of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine), and orientation was deduced based on the size of the protected fragments. In the absence of membranes, complete digestion with the two enzymes would theoretically leave fragments of no larger than 4 kDa (Fig. 2B) . This was experimentally shown not to be the case because a prominent product of 6.5 kDa remained after treatment (Fig. 4C, lane 3) . This product may have been the result of short regions of secondary structure masking enzyme digestion sites. Assuming the membrane orientation is as predicted in Fig. 2C and all available enzyme sites are cleaved, a protected glycosylated polypeptide of 15-18 kDa would be expected (i.e., cleavage after aa 112 would yield a core product of 12.6 kDa to which two high mannose side chains would add 3-6 kDa). As illustrated in Fig. 4C , lane 5, protected fragments of \u03f317 and \u03f324 kDa were obtained. These results demonstrate, first, that the 31-kDa species has a substantial cytoplasmic tail. Second, the existence of a predicted 17-kDa fragment supports the topographic model depicted in Fig. 2C . The existence of the unexpected 24-kDa fragment could be explained by the hydrophobicity of aa 91-201 (Fig. 2) , which might lead to a state of protection from the protease. Such might be the case if the hydrophobic portion of the protein closely interacts with the membrane on the cytoplasmic side. A similarly extended hydrophobic region was thought to lead to protection of protease-sensitive sites on the rotavirus NS28 protein by the same mechanism (Bergman et al., 1989) . Alternatively, aa 91-201, or some portion of them, could yield a second transmembrane domain with a luminal positioning of the C-terminus. This topography, found for some molecules of the TGEV multispanning M protein (Risco et al., 1995) , could potentially yield a protease-resistant fragment of 24 kDa.",

For this, gradient purified virus was electrophoresed in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel in parallel with known quantities of fusion protein and then blotted with fusion protein-specific antiserum. Because in the peak fraction of purified virus (fraction 10 in Figs. 6, A and B) there are an estimated 3 \u03eb 10 10 virions (estimated from a known titer of 2 \u03eb 10 9 infectious units/ml in supernatant fluids at 18 h postinfection and a sedimentation distribution resulting in 50% of the virus is in the peak fraction), then 341, 34.1, and 3.41 ng of fusion protein in the separate lanes would be equivalent to 100, 10, and 1 molecule/virion. In parallel experiments with protease factor Xa (New England Biolabs)-digested fusion protein, however, it was determined with fusion protein-specific antibody that only one fourth of the signal in the fusion protein band was due to the gene 3b moiety (data not shown). Therefore, on the basis of radiolabel, a band of equal intensity to the peak virus fraction would be equivalent to 400, 40, and 4 molecules/virion, respectively. As can be seen in FIG. 4 . In vitro translation in the presence of microsomal membranes to test for translocation, membrane anchorage, and glycosylation. (A) Treatment of microsomes recovered from a translation mix with carbonate or EDTA. M indicates molecular weight markers; T, total translation mix; S, supernatant fraction after pelleting membranes; P, pelleted membrane fraction. (B) Treatment of microsomes recovered from a translation mix with N-glycosidase F. Detergent treatment was 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v) and N-glycosidase F concentrations were 2500 and 5000 U/20 l . (C) Proteaseresistant fragment of the 27.7-kDa protein in microsomes. Protease treatment was an incubation at 0\u00b0C for 90 min with a mixture of 1 mg each of trypsin and chymotrypsin per milliliter, and detergent treatment was 2% Triton-X 100. Fig. 6A , although radiolabel is observable in all three lanes of the quantitative standard (lanes 1-3) , no radiolabel was observed in the virus lanes even when threefold greater film exposure time was used (lanes 4-8), indicating that if present, gene 3b products are \u03fd4 molecules/virion. The same blot probed with TGEV-specific hyperimmune porcine serum shows the presence of abundant virus in fractions 9-12 (Fig. 6B,  lanes 4-8) .",

            "text": "In this study, we show that two protein species are synthesized in vitro from gene 3b of the Purdue strain of TGEV. The most abundant species, the presumed prod-uct of the full-length transcript, is a 27.7-kDa integral membrane protein that becomes glycosylated and electrophoretically migrates in its fully glycosylated form as a molecule of \u03f331 kDa. We conclude from our analyses that the hydrophobic 16-aa N-terminus of the full-length product functions as a signal sequence for membrane translocation but is not cleaved. Interestingly, a recently published algorithm (Nielsen et al., 1997) would not predict cleavage of this postulated signal peptide. We predict, therefore, that asparagine residues N17 and N22 are the likely sites for sugar chain addition, and because it is distal to the transmembrane transfer-stop domain, N132 is unlikely to be a site for glycosylation. Thus the gain in mass of \u03f34 kDa is probably due to glycosylation at both N17 and N22, but this has not been confirmed by mutational analysis. We did not test for evidence of protein acylation. We therefore conclude that the glycosylated 27.7-kDa protein has the orientation depicted in Fig. 2C , which places the majority of the polypeptide in the cytoplasm. The extreme acidity of the hydrophilic C-terminus suggests that it may interact with a basic protein. The second product from the translation of gene 3b in vitro is a nonglycosylated polypeptide of 20 kDa that we postulate to be the result of either downstream initiation of translation or a proteolytic event.",

Several attempts to immunoprecipitate a product at different times throughout infection from either the Purdue or Miller strains were unsuccessful. This suggests to us that perhaps the products of gene 3b are in extremely low abundance or are unstable. Nevertheless, immunofluorescence data show that gene 3b products at 15 h postinfection are distributed both throughout the cytoplasm and at concentrated sites primarily in the perinuclear region of infected cells. We postulate, therefore, that the soluble 20-kDa form is distributed throughout the cytoplasm, whereas the membrane-anchored glycosylated 31-kDa form is in the perinuclear membranes within the region where virus assembly has been shown to occur (Tooze et al., 1984) .",

The fact that gene 3b is truncated in two cell culture-passaged strains of TGEV and in closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus strains (Vaughn et al., 1995) suggests that it is not necessary for virus replication in cell culture. Still, its conservation in size and sequence among several field strains of TGEV (Fig. 1) and PRCV Vaughn et al., 1995) argue that it does function in some capacity during replication in the animal. Curiously, the truncated 3b gene in the Purdue 115 and SP Miller strains (truncated at the N-terminus) would still encode the 20-kDa species, leaving open the possibility that the truncated protein is expressed and fulfills, perhaps only partially, a gene 3b function. A computer search for proteins with sequence identity to that of the TGEV gene 3b product revealed only the homologous protein in other serogroup I coronaviruses [canine coronavirus (Horsburgh et al., 1992) , feline infectious peritonitis virus and feline enteric coronavirus (GenBank accession no.
