Peptides derived from the HR regions of some viruses have also been shown to inhibit viral entry. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was predicted to have HR regions (HR1 and HR2) in the spike glycoprotein S2 subunit. Based on this analysis, six peptides derived from HR1 and HR2 were selected, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. Three peptides (HR2M, HR2L and HR2P) were identified as potential competitive inhibitors in PEDV in vitro infection assays, with the HR2P peptide representing the most potent inhibitor. Further study indicated that immunization of HR2P in mice elicited antibodies capable of neutralizing PEDV infection in vitro. These results demonstrate that the HR2P peptide and anti-HR2P antibody can serve as a tool for dissecting the fusion mechanism of PEDV, guiding the search for potent inhibitors with therapeutic value against PEDV infection.",

PED was first identified in Europe in the early 1970s, and the virus was first isolated in Belgium in 1978 (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) . PEDV outbreaks have since been reported in many swine-producing regions including China (Chen et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2012) , the USA , Canada (Ojkic et al., 2015) and Europe (Dastjerdi et al., 2015; Mesquita et al., 2015) . Although most sow herds had previously been vaccinated with a CV777-based inactivated vaccine, a large-scale outbreak of PED was observed in suckling piglets on many farms in China starting in late 2010, which has resulted in increased economic losses associated with high morbidity and mortality. On the basis of phylogenetic differences of full-length genomic sequences, PEDV strains were classified into two distinct genogroups, genogroup-1 (G1) and genogroup-2 (G2). PEDV field strains isolated before 2010 including CV777 and the derived vaccine strains belonged to G1, whereas the emergent PEDV strains isolated since 2011 in China and US fell into G2 . The ongoing importance of this disease necessitates the development of an effective vaccine and antiviral treatment.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses have the largest genome among RNA viruses, which encodes several proteins that are embedded on the surface of the viral envelope. It is generally believed that the spike (S) glycoprotein initially binds to the cell surface receptor, causing a conformational change that exposes the fusion peptide to the target cell membrane. Subsequently, highly conserved heptad repeat (HR) regions interact to form six-helix bundle (6-HB) structures, which contribute to the fusion of virus and cell membranes (Eckert and Kim, 2001) . The S glycoprotein consists of S1 and S2 subunits; S1 is located at the N-terminus and binds to the cell receptor (Ballesteros et al., 1997) , whereas S2 is involved in the viruscell fusion process. Many in vitro studies of coronavirus infection have reported that exogenous soluble HR2 peptide can bind to viral HR1, thereby efficiently blocking viral entry into the cell and inhibiting https replication (Bosch et al., 2004; Deng et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2004 Liu et al., , 2009 ). Based on these findings, entry inhibitors have also been identified for coronaviruses and other viruses, such as HR2 for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV; (Yuan et al., 2004) , Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; (Gao et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2013) , mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; (Bosch et al., 2003) , T20 from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (Imai et al., 2000) , and GP610 for Ebola virus (Watanabe et al., 2000) .",

Based on the study on the fusion mechanism of coronaviruses described above, a general approach had been developed that was successfully used to study antiviral peptides in other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MHV and MERS-CoV. Similarly, in this study, in order to find a potent inhibitor of viral entry, a series of peptides overlapping the predicted HR regions in the PEDV S2 subunit were designed and screened for inhibitory effects in a G2 PEDV infection assay. Cross-reactivity of these peptides with G1 PEDV was also investigated. Three peptides (HR2M, HR2L and HR2P) that were able to inhibit entry were identified, with HR2P being the most potent. Furthermore, immunization of HR2P in mice elicited antibodies that were capable of neutralizing PEDV infection in vitro.",

The PEDV G1 strain ZJU/G1/2013 (GenBank Accession No. KU664503) was propagated in Vero cells. Briefly, Vero cells were seeded at 70% confluency in 6-well plates and incubated overnight. After washing the cells with PBS, viruses at MOI = 0.1 diluted in maintenance medium with trypsin (MMT) containing DMEM, 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB), 5 \u03bcg/mL trypsin (Sigma, Cat#T7186-50TAB, St Louis, MO, USA), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, were added to each well. After 2 h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cells were washed with PBS and then cultured with MMT. Cells were observed daily to check for any cytopathic effect (CPE), particularly syncytium formation. When CPE was obvious, whole cell cultures (supernatant and cells) were harvested and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles prior to removal of cell debris by centrifugation. The virus titers of PEDV-GFP and PEDV-G1 were determined by endpoint dilutions as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) on Vero cells, respectively. Virus stocks were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.",

Three different tests were conducted: cells exposed to peptides prior to infection (pre-treatment), during entry (co-treatment), or after viral entry (post-treatment). HR2M, HR2L, and HR2P showed potent antiviral activity in co-treatment, and to a lesser extent in other assays (Fig. 4) .

These results indicate that treatment with HR2-derived peptides may serve as an antiviral intervention by suppressing PEDV entry. The ability of the peptides to cross-react with a different PEDV strain representing G1 (strain ZJU/G1/2013) was also tested. Various peptides from the HR2 region of PEDV-GFP (HR2M, HR2L and HR2P) demonstrated antiviral activity against ZJU/G1/2013 in comparison with the GST control, reducing the numbers of PEDV-producing FFU by 20-62% when used in co-treatment, as determined by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with an anti-PEDV-S1 antibody ( Fig. 5A and  B) .",

A similar anti-S2-mAb reacted with this epitope (a gift from Dr. Ying Fang, unpublished data) was used as the positive control, which suppressed about 50% of PEDV-GFP infection between 1:128 to 1:256 dilutions (Fig. 6) .

In the early 1990s, synthetic peptides derived from the HR2 domain of HIV-1 were discovered to be highly potent inhibitors of HIV fusion (Wild et al., 1994) . This anti-HIV-1 peptide (T-20; brand name: Fuzeon; generic name: enfuvirtide) was licensed by the FDA in 2003, and has already been incorporated into clinical regimens with strong efficacy (Pang et al., 2009 ). In addition, the HR-derived peptides (HR1 and HR2) of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and FCoV can effectively inhibit viral membrane fusion, and though the crystal structure of the PEDV S protein has not been reported, similar regions were identified by amino acid sequence alignment. In this study, peptides corresponding to PEDV HR1 and HR2 were expressed in order to empirically confirm their function in PEDV.",

            "text": "It has been reported that peptides derived from HR2 domain in particular are able to inhibit infection of feline coronavirus , MERS-CoV (Lu et al., 2014) , and SARS-CoV (Bosch et al., 2004) . The inhibitory efficacy was not related to the length of the HR2 peptides, and the amino acid residues 1161-1175 were essential for inhibiting SARS-CoV infection. In the current work, the potential inhibitory activity of the HR1-and HR2-derived peptides was studied on PEDV replication in vitro. The antiviral and cross-reactivity of the soluble recombinant peptides were measured in three different ways. HR2M, HR2L, HR2P efficiently suppressed PEDV replication in both coand post-treatments, with IC 50 's less than 12 \u03bcM. However, it was unknown why the HR2 peptides exerted impact in post-treatment. We hypothesized that binding of the peptides to the surface of infected and uninfected cells may restrict the re-infection and spread of the progeny viruses. Also, the PEDV inhibitory effect to a certain degree in HR2M, HR2L and HR2P pre-treatments might come from the presence of the peptides bound to the cellular surface non-specifically. Future studies on molecular dissecting of PEDV entry are warranted to answer this question. Analysis of antigenic characteristics of the peptides (Supplemental Fig. 2 ) indicated that HR2M, HR2L and HR2P exhibited strong hydrophilicity, surface accessibility, and flexibility, which are in line with the characteristics of immunogenic epitopes. While examining the inhibitory effect of these peptides, we found that HR2P, with extra C-terminal amino acids \"NRVET\" compared to HR2M and HR2L, showed significant inhibitory activity (Figs. 2 and 3) . The difference in inhibition efficiency of HR2P, HR2M and HR2L indicates that the conserved C-terminus of PEDV HR2 may play an important role in viral invasion. The spike glycoprotein is naturally found in trimeric structures on the surface of virus particles, and is responsible for adsorption and fusion while inducing host neutralizing antibodies and immune responses, highlighting its importance in vaccine development. The polyclonal antibodies induced by PEDV-HR2P linear antigens in this study demonstrated strong neutralization of PEDV in vitro (Fig. 6) , probably due to blockage of HR2-mediated virus membrane fusion. On the basis of this finding, better strategies of immunization may be devised for inducing neutralizing antibodies to PEDV with the HR2P sequence.",
