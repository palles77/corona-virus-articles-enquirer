We identified and characterized the 3CL protease of Ectropis obliqua virus (EoV) of the newly established family Iflaviridae (order Picornavirales). The bacterially expressed EoV 3CL protease domain autocatalytically released itself from larger precursors by proteolytic cleavage, and cleavage sites were determined via N-terminal sequencing of the cleavage products. This protease also mediated trans-proteolytic activity and cleaved the polyprotein at the same specific positions. Moreover, we determined the critical catalytic residues (H2261, D2299, C2383) for the protease activity, and characterized the biochemical properties of EoV 3CL and its responses to various protease inhibitors. Our work is the first study to identify an iflaviral 3CL protease and further characterize it in detail and should foster our understanding of EoV and other iflaviruses.",

            "text": "The proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a crucial step in genome replication and CPs assembly in the order Picornavirales, whose genome generally translates a large precursor polyprotein. After translation, the viral precursor polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved to generate mature functional viral proteins (Dougherty and Semler, 1993) . This maturation process is usually mediated by (more than one) proteases, and a 3C (for the family Picornaviridae) or 3C-like (3CL) protease (for other families) plays a central role in the cleavage of the viral precursor polyprotein (Le Gall et al., 2008; Palmenberg, 1990) . To date, 3C and 3CL proteases have been extensively studied in several viruses in the order Picornavirales, particularly hepatitis A virus (HAV), poliovirus (PV), human rhinovirus (HRV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), human enterovirus 71 (EV71), and footand-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in the family Picornaviridae (Bablanian and Grubman, 1993; Bonderoff et al., 2008; de Breyne et al., 2008; Ghildyal et al., 2009; Goodwin et al., 2009; Harmon et al., 1992; Lawson et al., 1999; Lu et al., 2011; Rivera and Lloyd, 2008) . Furthermore, the crystallographic structures of picornaviral 3C proteases from HRV, HAV, FMDV, and EV71 have been determined, which facilitates the identification of the active sites of these 3C proteases. The functional and structural studies of 3C or 3CL proteases have revealed that most of them are cysteine proteases and contain the chymotrypsin (two b-barrel) fold; therefore, they are also called ''chymotrypsin-like proteases'' (CHL Pro ) (Allaire et al., 1994; Cui et al., 2011; Gorbalenya et al., 1986; Malcolm, 1995; Matthews et al., 1994; Sweeney et al., 2007) .",

In addition, the viral structure and genomic organization of iflaviruses are quite similar to those of the viruses of the family Picornaviridae (Le Gall et al., 2008) . Ectropis obliqua virus (EoV) was initially identified by our group in 2000 and was classified as a member of the Iflaviridae family in January 2010 (van Oers, 2010; Wang et al., 2004) . EoV is an insect positive-strand RNA virus that leads to a lethal granulosis infection in the larvae of the tea looper (Ectropis obliqua), which is an important agricultural pest that can seriously damage tea leaves. To date, the genomic RNA of EoV has been cloned as fulllength cDNA and completely sequenced. The genome of EoV consists of 9394 nucleotides (nts) excluding the poly(A) tail and contains a single large open reading frame (nt 391-9351) encoding a polyprotein of 2987 amino acids. In this polyprotein, structural and nonstructural proteins are located at its N-and C-terminal regions respectively, and the conservative Hel-Pro-Pol and CPs domains have been identified as well (Fig. 1A ) (Wang et al., 2004) . In the 5 0 untranslated region (5 0 UTR), an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) has been shown to play an essential role in mediating EoV cap-independent translation (Lu et al., 2007 (Lu et al., , 2006 . The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity of EoV has also been identified (Lin et al., 2010) . In addition to EoV, the family Iflaviridae comprises other invertebrate viruses, such as infectious flacherie virus (IFV) of the silkworm, Sacbrood virus (SBV) of the honeybee, Perina nuda virus (PnV), deformed wing virus (DWV), and Varroa destructor virus-1 (VDV-1), as well as some tentative members like slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV) and Nasonia vitripens virus (NvV) (Christian et al., 2005; van Oers, 2010) .",

The putative EoV cysteine protease motif GXCG is located in the C-terminal half of the polyprotein precursor, upstream of the RdRp domain, and the putative catalytic triad of H2261, D2299, and C2383 is also conserved in EoV and other iflaviruses (Fig. 1B) (Wang et al., 2004) . Despite the importance of 3C and 3CL proteases in viruses in the order Picornavirales (Le Gall et al., 2008) , 3CL protease activity in iflaviruses has not been formally determined, and consequently, the molecular mechanisms of 3CL-mediated cleavage of iflaviral polyproteins have not yet been studied, which significantly limits our understanding of this new family.",

The mutants His-Pro 2160-2680 -Flag(C2383A) and His-Pro 2026-2738 -Flag(C2383A) could not undergo any autocatalytic cleavage, as the Western blots with both anti-His and anti-Flag antibodies revealed only the intact fusion proteins at their expected molecular weights (i.e., 78 kDa and 99 kDa respectively) (Fig. 1D , lanes 1-4).

All four fusion proteins contained the entire 3CL region; both His-Pro 2160-2492 and His-Pro 2026-2492 included one predicted cleavage site at the N-terminal of EoV 3CL, His-3C3D 0 included one predicted cleavage site at the C-terminal of EoV 3CL, whereas His-Pro 2160-2680 -Flag contained the two predicted cleavage sites at both N-and C-terminals (Fig. 3A ). Western blot analyses using anti-3CL polyclonal antibodies revealed that His-Pro 2160-2492 was processed into two products, a 57-kDa band corresponding to the intact His-Pro 2160-2492 and a 34-kDa band corresponding to the predicted 3CL protease (Fig. 3C , lane 2). Similarly, His-Pro 2026-2492 was processed into two products that corresponded to the intact His-Pro 2026-2492 (72 kDa) and the 3CL protease (34 kDa) (Fig. 3C, lane 3) .",

            "text": "On the other hand, the bacterial expression of His-Pro 2160-2680 -Flag yielded four protein bands. In addition to the intact fusion protein (78 kDa), the 54-kDa and 57-kDa band corresponded to the cleavage product generated from the single cleavage at the Nor C-terminal of the 3CL domain, respectively, and the 34-kDa band corresponded to the cleavage product generated from the double cleavage at both the N-and C-terminals of the 3CL domain (Fig. 3C, lane 4) . The bacterial expression of all three recombinant fusion proteins yielded the 34-kDa products that apparently corresponded to 3CL protease. In addition, the His-3C3D 0 was processed into two products. The 74-kDa band corresponded to the intact His-3C3D 0 , while the 53-kDa band corresponded to the cleavage product generated from the single cleavage at the C-terminal of the 3CL domain (Fig. 3D , lane 2). Taken together, these results confirm the autocatalytic processing activity of the EoV 3CL protease and further indicate the size of EoV 3CL. The EoV 3CL protease has been proposed to be a cysteine protease containing the catalytic triad of H2261, D2299, and C2383, which is conserved in the Iflaviridae family (Fig. 1B) . To determine whether these conserved residues are responsible for the autocatalytic processing of the EoV polyprotein, we expressed the wild-type fusion protein His-Pro 2026-2492 and its mutants His-Pro 2026-2492 (H2261A), His-Pro 2026-2492 (C2383A), and His-Pro 2026-2492 (D2299A) in E. coli Compared with the wild-type His-Pro 2026-2492 (Fig. 3C, lane 3) , only one 72-kDa band at the expected molecular weight of the intact His-Pro 2026-2492 (H2261A) or His-Pro 2026-2492 (C2383A) was observed (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3) , indicating that the substitution of H2261 or C2383 with alanine (A) could abolish the cleavage activity of the EoV 3CL protease. These experiments were independently repeated several times with extended reaction or exposure time, and the same results were obtained (data not shown). Interestingly, the autocatalytic processing activity of His-Pro 2026-2492 (D2299A) was much weaker than that of wildtype His-Pro 2026-2492 (Fig. 4B , lane 4 vs. Fig. 3C , lane 3), indicating that the D2299A substitution inhibits but does not abolish the protease activity of EoV 3CL. The mutagenesis analyses of the EoV 3CL protease showed that the conserved H2261, D2299, and C2383 play critical roles in EoV 3CL protease activity and provided further confirmation of the cleavage activity of EoV 3CL.",

To this end, the fusion protein GST-Pro 2176-2677 -His, which contains amino acids 2176-2677 and covers the complete 3CL domain and flanking sequences with both cleavage sites, was expressed (Fig. 5) . After bacterial expression and purification for His fusion protein via Ni-NTA, the purified products were separated via SDS-PAGE. Three proteins with molecular weights of 82 kDa, 56 kDa, and 21 kDa were readily detected (Fig. 5, lane 1) . The 82-kDa band corresponded to the intact fusion protein GST-Pro 2176-2677 -His, whereas the 56-kDa and 21-kDa bands corresponded to the products cleaved at the N-and C-terminals of the 3CL protease domain, respectively. The purified cleavage products were then subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing analyses. The N-terminal amino acids of the 56-kDa cleavage product were determined to be AQAK, which are mapped to amino acids 2193-2196 of the EoV polyprotein, indicating that N-terminal cleavage takes place in the E/A dipeptide at positions 2192 and 2193 (Fig. 5) . On the other hand, N-terminal sequencing of the autoprocessed 21-kDa product revealed that the sequence was SATA, which corresponds to the amino acids 2492-2495, indicating that C-terminal cleavage occurs in the Q/S dipeptide at positions 2491 and 2492. Of note, a faint band less than 56 kDa was detected; however, N-terminal sequencing of this band was unsuccessful, and this band may represent a bacterial contaminant. Taken together, these results indicate that the N-and C-terminal boundaries of the EoV 3CL protease are amino acids 2193 and 2491.",

Therefore, we sought to determine whether EoV 3CL could intermolecularly cleave its natural substrate, the EoV polyprotein, in trans. Histagged EoV 3CL protease (His-3CL) was bacterially expressed and purified as the functional enzyme, and the protease-defective His-3CL(C2383A) mutant was used as the negative control (Fig. 6A) . On the other hand, the purified fusion protein His-3C3D 0 (C2383A) contains a cleavage site between the 3CL region and partial 3D-like/RdRp domain and was used as the transcleavage substrate. The C2383A substitution completely abolished the 3CL protease activity in the fusion protein, thereby excluding the possibility of any intramolecular cleavage. The trans-cleavage products were analyzed via 12% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6B) . After 6 h of incubation, wild-type His-3CL efficiently cleaved His-3C3D 0 (C2383A), as the level of the 53-kDa band corresponding to both His-3CL and the trans-cleavage product His-3CL(C2383A) was increased and an additional $ 21-kDa band corresponding to 3D 0 appeared (Fig. 6B, lane 4) , when compared with the levels of the same reaction mix before incubation (Fig. 6B, lane 2) .

We also observed that proteolytic processing efficiency was higher at the C-terminal site Q/S than at the N-terminal site E/A. In the cleavage assay, the C-terminal (Q/S) cleavage products were obviously much more prominent than the N-terminal (E/A) cleavage products (Figs. 2B and 5); likewise, in the trans-cleavage assay, cleavage in Q/S was more effective than in E/A (Fig. 6C, lane 4) . Consistently, most 3C and 3C-like proteases appear to prefer glutamine (Q) to glutamic acid (E) for cleavage (Palmenberg, 1990) . The specificity for glutamine has been attributed to the ability of the carboxamide group of the glutamine to form hydrogen bonds with two conserved amino acids (threonine, histidine) in the substrate binding pocket of 3C and 3CL proteases (Matthews et al., 1994) .",

As expected, the addition of Hg 2 \u00fe , Zn 2 \u00fe , and sulfhydryl reagents such as PCMBS, MMTS, and NEM strongly inhibited EoV 3CL protease activity thereby confirming the finding that Cys-2383 is required for the catalysis of polyprotein processing and that EoV 3CL is a cysteine protease. On the other hand, the serine protease inhibitor PMSF also reduced the activity of EoV 3CL, but to a lesser extent (Fig. 7F) . Similarly, several other 3C and 3CL cysteine proteases, such as Chiba virus 3CL protease and poliovirus 3C protease have also been reported to be inhibited by PMSF (Baum et al., 1991; Someya et al., 2005) . This phenomenon may exist because 3C and 3CL proteases share the structural homology of chymotrypsin-like folds and have a proteolytic mechanism similar to that of serine proteases.",

            "text": "Like the 3CL proteases of norovirus and EAV, the EoV 3CL protease is relatively sensitive to varying Na \u00fe ionic concentrations (Someya et al., 2005; van Aken et al., 2006) , because high concentrations of Na \u00fe strongly inhibited the proteolytic activity of EoV 3CL. In contrast, the 3CL proteases of mouse hepatitis virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are insensitive to 100-500 mM of Na \u00fe (Seybert et al., 1997; Xu et al., 2010) . Moreover, the presence of Mg 2 \u00fe or Ca 2 \u00fe did not visibly affect the proteolytic activity of EoV 3CL. In addition, we found that the optimal pH for EoV 3CL is about 7.5 rather than the acidic pH we previously expected based on the physiological environment in insect cells. These biochemical features suggest that the EoV 3CL protease is localized and functions in a limited environment such as an intracellular organelle within infected cells. Moreover, instead of the optimal temperature of 27 1C for insect cell culture, the optimal temperature for the protease activity of EoV 3CL is around 22 1C, which corresponds well to the appropriate environments for the growth of the natural host of EoV, the tea looper (Ectropis oblique, 20-24 1C). In nature, the growth and reproduction of tea loopers are greatly affected by various meteorologic factors, and the temperature is one of the most important factors (Xue et al., 2009) .",
