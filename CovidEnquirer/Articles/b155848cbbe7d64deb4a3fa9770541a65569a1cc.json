As people and goods travel increasingly rapidly around the world, so do pathogens; we must be prepared to understand their spread, in terms of the contact network between hosts, viral life history and within-host dynamics. This will require collaborative work that takes into account viral life history, strategy and evolution, and host genetics, demographics and immunodynamics. Mathematical models are a useful tool for integrating the data and analyses from diverse fields that contribute to our understanding of viral transmission dynamics in heterogeneous host populations.",

It is crucial to recognize that severity of disease is not necessarily correlated with transmission. For example, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, caused by the measles virus years after the original symptoms occur [1] , is a severe and often fatal disease, but has little impact on population level dynamics because there is no transmission of the virus. And the converse can be true -someone can be highly infectious yet show few disease symptoms, as in 'superspreading' events during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic [2, 3] . SARS is a rare example of a pathogen where many of the transmission events in an emergent epidemic were recreated from contact tracing [4] . Molecular techniques are now also used to trace a chain of transmission based on sequence similarities [5] . However, large-scale transmission experiments, such as those carried out with influenza virus in ferrets [6, 7] , are the ideal way to gain insight into biological processes that drive the transmission process. Unfortunately, for economic and ethical reasons, they are difficult to conduct on a sufficiently large scale to fully quantify transmission for the range of important pathogens.",

Mathematical models are a powerful tool here, allowing the researcher to integrate the many disciplines, including virology, immunology, viral and host genetics and behavioral sciences, that contribute to our knowledge of viral transmission. Epidemiological modeling and analysis is one way to assess correlation between data from these various fields. For example, the probability and rate ratios of transmission per contact event during different stages of HIV infection were estimated using Poisson regression. Statistical models were then used to identify co-variates that were associated with higher transmission. These included high viral load, genital ulcers and young age [8] . Population-level ecological modeling of disease dynamics has also influenced disease control policy for human and animal infections, such as identifying the proportion of a population that needs to be vaccinated against a diverse range of infections [9, 10] .",

            "text": "The basic model The most basic population-level epidemic model for viral infections is the compartmental, ordinary differential equation, the SEIR model, which tracks the proportion of a population in four classes -susceptible, exposed, infected and infectious, and recovered and immune -over time (Figures 1a, 2a estimating the rate at which individuals leave the infected and infectious class is possible. Further, the characteristic clinical manifestations of measles also make historical epidemic patterns based on disease notification relatively reliable. Measles also induces lifetime immunity, consistent with the assumption that once individuals recover, they never return to the susceptible class. Furthermore, the measles virus does not evolve quickly to escape immunity in previously infected hosts [12] . Thus, there is no return of individuals from the recovered class to the susceptible pool. The basic SEIR model goes a long way in explaining measles and other childhood disease dynamics [13] [14] [15] . The SEIR assumptions do not fit most other viral infections, however. Different viral strategies Figure 1 . Model simulations of ten years of epidemic with a variety of parameters. Each graph plots the output of a simulated epidemic over ten years. A transient period of 190 years, not plotted here, was run to move the dynamics onto a stable limit cycle. The proportion of the population infected is plotted as a function of time in years. All simulations were run according to variants of the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered) model (Box 1). The model was seasonally forced using a sinusoidal function with a period of one year for more realistic dynamics by varying the transmission coefficient according to b(t). Seasonal forcing is a common phenomenon in childhood infections for which the dynamics are dependent on annual school term cycles. The transmission coefficient, b0, and the infectious period, g \u00c01 , were adjusted for each model to maintain approximately constant R 0 , as calculated assuming the sinusoidal term in b(t) = 0. The parameters, unless otherwise specified were: N = 1, g = 73, s = 45.625, m = 1/45, b0 = 1250, b1 = 0.1, r = 1. See Table 1 The carrier model divides the infected class into two groups, those who carry and those who clear the infection. This graph shows the effect of having 1% of the population as carriers, maintaining the infection chronically with b0 = 150.7841 and g2 = 0.1 or an infectious period of ten years. This has two noticeable effects on the epidemic curve. First, the number of infected individuals at any time is increased. Second, the depth of the troughs (difference between the maximum and minimum number of infected individuals) is smaller in the model with carriers than a homogeneously acute infection (trough depth 0.000202 and 0.00119, respectively). The minimum population size to maintain the expected number of infecteds > 1 is 1004 with carriers, versus 22 975 for the homogeneous acute system. (d) The SEIRS model incorporates a loss of immunity and return to the susceptible class. Loss of immunity in an acute infection results in no longer having biannual cycles, just seasonally forced yearly fluctuations and an overall increase in disease prevalence compared with the acute infection model.",

R 0 is the expected number of secondary infections resulting from the introduction of one infected individual into a completely susceptible population during the lifetime of the primary infection. A pathogen with an R 0 >1 is expected to spread throughout a population; with R 0 <1, it is expected to become extinct. At its simplest, R 0 can be characterized as b/g [16] [17] [18] . R 0 has been used to predict and compare the expected performance of epidemic control strategies such as vaccination [9] . It can also be useful for thinking about different evolutionary strategies of viral fitness. For example, two viruses could have the same R 0 , but one has a low value of b and long infectious period, whereas the other has the opposite. Although the viruses exhibit different dynamics and 'strategies' for establishment and persistence, they are equally fit when at equilibrium in the host population [19] [20] [21] .

Retroviruses use a different strategy to achieve a persistent infection; they integrate into the host genome. These RNA viruses are maintained as replication-competent DNA proviruses for the lifetime of the cell. Both strategies for persistence have similar population level dynamic consequences. They produce a long infectious period, which in turn results in an infected population at close to dynamic equilibrium, although seasonal or stochastic effects might drive fluctuations around this steady state in practice (Figure 1b) . Phenotypic and genotypic viral heterogeneity can affect virus transmission as well. Many viruses can cause either acute or persistent infections. For example, some individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) clear the virus, or rapidly succumb to the infection, resulting in an acute infection [24] . However, HCV is an RNA virus with a high error rate and is capable of generating extensive genetic diversity. This can lead to immune escape within a host and, consequently, a potential carrier, exhibiting a persistent infection with a long infectious period [25] (Figures 1c,  2b) .",

Population genetic studies have identified polymorphisms in the human population in both regulatory and coding regions for many of the genes associated with viral clearance, including IL-10, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-a (tumor necrosis factor a) and TNF-b [29, 30] . Individual hosts are not static in their susceptibility to infection over time. Malnutrition has long been linked to susceptibility to infectious disease. There is an association between decreases in solar radiation or nutritional intake of vitamin D through cod liver oil and higher incidence of respiratory infections, in particular influenza [31] . Moreover, an intriguing study on selenium suggests that its deficiency allows coxsackievirus and influenza to evolve a higher level of virulence in malnourished hosts [32] . Polymicrobial infections are the rule, not the exception [33] , and it is possible that they affect susceptibility to a secondary infection and the ability to clear either infection.",

In the second case, hosts lose their immunity to all circulating genotypes of a virus.

Host population size is important in maintaining a chain of transmission through these troughs; however, small populations can still allow for disease persistence. One possible explanation for this is immigration: an infected host from outside comes into the population and starts a new round of infections, as seen in measles [11, 38] . Another explanation is that a different host species can act as a reservoir for the virus, which could be the case with Ebola virus [39] . A third explanation is the presence of a low proportion of carriers, which can allow persistence even in small populations (Figures 1c, 2b) , as might be the case with foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) [40] .

But many viral infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), do not provide lifelong immunity, and at some point in the future the host can be re-infected [41] . Evolution of the virus or changes in host immune status can allow for re-infection. The simplest model that reflects loss of immunity is the SEIRS formulation, in which the final 'S' denotes 'susceptible' again.

There are many exciting questions to explore. How does variability in the host population's genetics, immune response, general health and behavior affect viral spread? What determines variability in the host immune response and length of immune memory? How does a virus' life cycle and evolution impact transmission success?",

Population genetics, case histories of concomitant infections, nutritional studies and social science research have provided empirical support for host heterogeneities in susceptibility to and clearance of viral infections. But understanding the population-level effects of these molecular, cellular within-host and between-host properties remains a challenge. Modeling studies that incorporate more of these fields show promise in answering these questions. SEIR models and their variants can reflect loss of immunity and carrier states. Social network models reflect the reality of different levels of contact among members of a population. More collaborative work among virology, immunology, social science, nutritional science and theoretical biology researchers, along with key largescale transmission experiments will facilitate a better understanding of viral transmission dynamics.",
