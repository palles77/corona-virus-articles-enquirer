Immunoglobulin preparations designed for farm animals are commercially available, and some colostrumbased products are marketed also for humans as dietary supplements. The concentration of specific antibodies against a certain pathogenic microorganism can be raised in colostrum and milk by immunizing cows with this pathogen or its antigen. Advances in bioseparation and chromatographic techniques have made it possible to fractionate and enrich these antibodies and formulate so-called hyperimmune colostral or milk preparations. Their efficacy in prevention and treatment of various microbial infections has been evaluated in numerous studies. Immune milk preparations have proven effective in prophylaxis against infections caused by a variety of gastrointestinal pathogens. Their therapeutic efficacy, however, seems more limited. A few commercial immune milk products are already on market and more applications can be expected in the coming years. This article reviews the recent progress made in isolation techniques of bovine immunoglobulins and the application of colostral and immune milk preparations in fighting various microbial infectious diseases in humans. r",

Igs are antibodies that are synthesized by mammals in response to antigenic or immunogenic stimuli such as bacteria and viruses, and thus provide protection against microbial infections. Bovine colostrum, which is a rich source of Igs, also confers passive immunity to the newborn during development of its own immune system (for a review see Lilius & Marnila, 2001) . Igs with specific antibody activities can be increased in lacteal secretions through targeted hyperimmunization protocols, using vaccines containing inactivated pathogenic microbial material against which the Ig activities are desired. This increased pool of antibodies can be enriched further through concentration/fractionation techniques, leading to production of Ig products containing high antibody concentrations and titres. Such preparations may find beneficial applications in human and animal healthcare and wellbeing by preventing infections and controlling diseases (for reviews see Kelly, 2003; Korhonen, Marnila, & Gill, 2000; Lilius & Marnila, 2001) . This review focuses on the current large-scale technologies employed to produce such specific Ig products, and the clinical studies undertaken to determine their efficacies against human and animal infections.",

IgM antibodies, which are produced in smaller amounts than IgG, are considerably more efficient than IgG in most of the above-mentioned activities, especially in complement fixation, but it remains obscure how significant this mechanism is in milk or colostrum. In contrast, the secretory IgA does not fix complement or opsonize bacteria, but agglutinates antigens, neutralizes viruses and bacterial toxins, and prevents the adhesion of enteropathogenic bacteria to mucosal epithelial cells (Marnila & Korhonen, 2002) .",

The recovery rate of Igs using these methods varied from 25% to 70% of the level present in the starting material. Thomas, Cordle, Criswell, Westfall, and Barefoot (1992) developed a process for selective enrichment of Igs from whey by filtration through formedin-place membranes on sintered stainless-steel tubes. The process employed both size exclusion and protein charge manipulation around the isoelectric point of proteins to selectively reject or pass components of the stream. IgG from cheese whey was enriched from 8% to 20% of total whey protein with 90% recovery of the IgG. More recently, Baruah and Belfort (2004) used the Predictive Aggregation Transport Model and microfiltration (0.1 mm pore size membrane) of transgenic goat milk with a helical hollowfibre module operated at low uniform transmembrane pressure, low permeate flux rate, and permeate co-current flow to increase the yield of Ig in the permeate from less than 1% to over 95%. Similarly, microfiltration (0.1 mm membrane porosity) combined with ultrafiltration (UF; membrane cut-off 100 kDa) of bovine, equine and caprine colostrum resulted in at least 80% recovery of IgG in the microfiltrate, and IgG/TS purity of more than 90% with subsequent ultrafiltration (Piot, Fauquant, Madec, & Maubois, 2004) . Mehra and Kelly (2004) also produced an Ig-rich fraction through microfiltration of cheese whey using tubular ceramic membranes (0.1 mm pore size). The Ig to protein ratio of this fraction was approximately 2.5-3.0 times that of the original cheese whey. Membrane-separation of milk/colostral whey Igs does not result in high purity or recovery of Ig fraction. Specific chromatographic techniques have been applied to further improve the yield and purity of the Ig preparations, but some of them may not be easily scaled-up. IgG was isolated from whey by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC). UF concentrated whey was applied to IMAC column loaded with copper, and IgG fractions with purities of 52% for cheese whey (Fukumoto, Li-Chan, Kwan, & Nakai, 1994) and 77.2% and 53% for acid and cheddar cheese whey, respectively (Al-Mashikhi, Li-Chan, & Nakai, 1988) were isolated. An immunoaffinity chromatography method suitable for isolating pure IgG subclasses IgG 1 and IgG 2 from cheddar cheese whey or colostrum was reported by Akita and Li-Chan (1998) . Immunoaffinity columns were made with specific egg yolk IgY raised against bovine IgG 1 and IgG 2 . Milk that was free of either IgG subclass was successfully produced by the selective removal of IgG 1 or IgG 2 subclasses by this technique. Expanded Bed Adsorption Chromatography (EBAC) was applied to isolate Igs from whey (Nielsen, Olander, & Lihme, 2002) using adsorbent with tailored ligand chemistry. EBAC provides significant advantages over conventional packed bed column chromatography. The decisive characteristic of the adsorbent media to expand in the column when upward flow of liquid is applied allows free passage of particulate impurities in the feed stream through the column thus allowing crude, non-clarified feeds to be applied to the column. Ig purity of between 50% and 70% was achieved by this method. The first industrial implementation of EBAC in the dairy industry has been carried out for the separation of whey proteins by Dairy Farmers in Australia.",

It is probable that this loss of antibody activity during whey preparation was due to the involvement of Igs in casein precipitate. The extent of the decrease was lower during whey production from skimmed colostrum than from whole colostrum. Additionally, rennet whey retained more antibody activity during manufacture than acid whey. The IgG antibody activity was resistant to heat treatment at 72 1C for 15 s, and less stable at 80 1C for 15 s in whole and skimmed colostrum, and skimmed colostral whey. On the other hand, the IgM activity in all colostrum-derived fractions was reduced by both heat treatments without any significant differences between the fractions. However, the SIgA antigen-specific antibody activity was more susceptible to whey preparation processes and heat treatments than IgG and IgM activities. The heat stability was markedly lower in whole colostrum than in other colostrum-derived fractions.",

Established milk heat treatments, batch pasteurization (63 1C for 30 min) did not destroy the specific antigen-binding activities of IgG, while high-temperature short-time (HTST, 72 1C for 15 s) led to 25-40% loss of IgG concentration and a similar reduction in antigen-binding activities. On the other hand, ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment (138 1C, 4 s) denatured all of the concentration and antigen-binding activities of IgG. In contrast, Mainer, Sa\u00b4nchez, Ena, and Calvo (1997) reported that bovine milk Igs could resist the HTST pasteurization treatment without affecting their structure. Only 1% of the IgG, 2% of the IgA, and 14% of the IgM concentrations were denatured when milk samples were heated in glass capillaries and a temperaturecontrolled water bath. Denaturation of IgG was determined using RID. In a similar further study, Mainer, Dominguez, Randrup, Sanchez, and Calvo (1999) also showed that the HTST pasteurization had little effect on the activity of bovine colostral IgG as the original rotavirus neutralizing activity was reduced by only 0.5%.",

The antibody titre against certain pathogen or its virulence factor can be raised up to several hundred times by immunizing the cow with microbial vaccines before parturition. Such an immune colostrum resulting from immunization regimes has fundamentally different properties and efficacies against pathogens than normal colostrum and these two concepts should, therefore, be differentiated from each other. This is emphasized by the fact that at present normal colostrum and preparations made from it are in many countries regarded as a food or dietary supplement, whereas the colostral preparations from immunized cows are often regarded as pharmaceuticals or their regulatory status remains to be defined.",

The adherence of the principal caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans is a crucial factor in the colonization of the oral cavity. In recent studies bovine colostral Igs have been shown specifically to block bacterial colonization factors when cows are immunized with proper bacterial structures. Mitoma et al. (2002) prepared a fusion of a saliva-binding alanine-rich region of a cell surface protein antigen (Pac) and a glucan-binding domain of the glucosyltransferase-I cell surface protein from Str. mutans and immunized cows with the fusion. The immune milk preparation made from colostrum of these cows proved effective in the prevention of dental caries development in an experimental rat model when given as concentrate once a day for 55 days. Shimazaki et al. (2001) examined the effect of immune milk containing antibodies against the above mentioned fusion protein, on adult subjects after an antibiotic (cetylpyridinium chloride) treatment. The immune milk inhibited significantly recolonization of Str. mutans in the saliva and plaque as compared to the control group. Also, the ratios of Str. mutans to total streptococci in saliva and plaque of the immune milk group were lower than in the control group.",

(1997) that the immune milk from cows immunized with a Str. mutans and Str. sobrinus whole cell vaccine inhibited in vitro glucosyltransferase and fructosyltransferase activities of Str. mutans, inhibited adherence of the bacteria to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite particles and promoted aggregation of Str. mutans (Loimaranta et al., 1998) . When used as a mouth rinse for 3 days the immune preparation resulted in a higher resting pH in dental plaque of adults as compared with the control groups (Loimaranta et al., 1999) . The relative number of mutans streptococci decreased significantly after the immune product rinsing period when compared to the controls. Thus, the rinsing with bovine immune whey indicates favourable effects on human dental plaque by controlling Str. mutans in the human oral cavity. Wei et al. (2002) supplemented pasteurized milk with the above immune preparation and fermented the milk with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, ATCC 53103 (LGG). This probiotic bacteria was earlier shown to reduce caries risk in day care children when added in milk (Na\u00a8se et al., 2001) and to decrease salivary Str. mutans counts in adult subjects when administered in cheese (Ahola et al., 2002) . The immune preparation did not prevent the growth of LGG in milk or the fermentation. The specific antibodies had a synergistic Str. mutans adhesion inhibiting effect with LGG in vitro. In both LGG-fermented and UHT-treated milk, the activity of added anti-caries antibodies was maintained during the expected shelf-life of these products. From the anticariogenic point of view it may be beneficial to add bovine-specific antibodies against mutans streptococci to probiotic LGG-containing milk products.",

In another study, 60 coronary bypass patients were given 42 g daily of either bovine colostral preparation or placebo starting 2 days before surgery ; Bo\u00a8lke, Orth et al., 2002) . The colostral preparation did reduce postoperative CRP-levels, but failed to reduce perioperative endotoxemia. It is not known whether these results can be attributed to colostral Igs neutralizing endotoxins in intestine or to growth factors enforcing gut barrier.",

In order to improve the efficacy of such preparations customized immunization schemes of cows has been designed with the purpose of raising specific antibodies. The enhancement of specific antibody activities of milk Igs through targeted immunization and isolation/concentration technologies may in future have remarkable potential in producing Ig products for human health care, not only as part of a health-promoting diet, but also as an alternative or supplement to the medical cure of specified human diseases. In clinical trials, the Ig preparations have seldom caused any undesired symptoms and the health risks are mainly due to allergenic properties of whey proteins (Bernhisel-Broadbent, Yolken, & Sampson, 1991; Gingerich & McPhillips, 2005) . However, the regulatory status of these products is still unclear in many countries or they are treated as pharmaceuticals (for a case study, see Hoerr & Bostwick, 2002) .",

The prevention of diarrhoea should not only diminish mortality but also improve health, in general. Increasing antibiotic resistance among pathogens gives emphasis to the need to develop new means to prevent diseases by nutritional intervention. Modulation of the GI flora has turned out to be an integral part of health promotion also in developed countries. It is suggested that combining bovine milk or colostral Igs with probiotic lactic acid bacteria could provide considerable prospects for health promotion in the future. Other bioactive components occurring naturally in colostrum, such as lactoferrin and growth factors may also have synergistic effects when addressing gastrointestinal disorders.",
