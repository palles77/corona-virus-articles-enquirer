Hospital transmission of communicable diseases, a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, lack of resources for isolation and disinfection, and widespread antimicrobial resistance create major risks for healthcare-related infections. Few data exist on the prevalence or impact of these infections in such environments. There is a need for interventions to reduce the burden of healthcare-related infections in the tropics and to set up effective surveillance programmes to determine their impact. Both the Global (G8) International Development Summit of 2005 and the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have committed major resources to alleviating poverty and poor health in the developing world over the next decade. Targeting resources specifically to infection control in lowresource settings must be a part of this effort, if the wider aims of the MDGs to improve healthcare are to be achieved. \u00aa 2007 The Hospital Infection Society.

The first is the overwhelming disadvantages faced by health workers surrounded by HIV/AIDS, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, overcrowding and lack of resources for the most basic of hygiene activities. The second is the impossibility of knowing the magnitude of hospital-related infections and optimum treatment strategies without effective laboratory services. These comments would certainly have been equally appropriate 10 or 15 years ago. Might 2007 be a turning point? With the current emphasis of governments and UN agencies to focus again on poverty and health, there is an opportunity to move healthcare-related infections, and the support required in terms of laboratory development, education, hospital infrastructure, and appropriate professional training, into a focused agenda, rather than the 'Cinderella' position that has until now been the case.",

He died a week later. Over the next week, a nurse, a cleaner, and a hospital messenger became unwell, and then further medical and auxiliary staff.

Specific guidelines for control in district hospitals have been drawn up by WHO, and these cover issues including patient isolation, locally produced protective clothing, waste disposal, disinfectants, and community education. 9 Early diagnosis of the first cases, often in the community or peripheral health centres, is the mainstay of ensuring that preventive measures are initiated in a timely fashion and that transmission is kept to a minimum. If severe acute respiratory syndrome, pandemic influenza or H5N1 avian flu were to become pathogens in these underresourced tropical areas, the pattern of the 1976 Ebola outbreaks could be repeated.",

            "text": "In any hospital infection control programme in much of Africa, and large parts of Asia and Latin America, prevention of the spread of HIV, between patients, from patients to health workers, and from health workers to patients, is a priority. Largely due to the UN and WHO Global Aids Programme, there is considerable literature and guidance available. 10 At the level of the individual, poorly resourced hospital with limited reuseable equipment and disinfectants, HIV is a major concern for all health workers and local health education and support programmes have been shown to be effective. 11 With the rise in HIV, there has been an increasing prevalence of tuberculosis, both in HIV-affected patients but also in the wider community, and in many areas an increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB). This poses a risk for nosocomial transmission between patients, but particularly for health workers who will have direct contact, often with undiagnosed cases, and with less than adequate protective clothing. 12 There are likely to be few rural hospitals in Africa with a supply of PFR95 masks. The strict barrier precautions described by UK and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines are unlikely to be practicable and workers dealing with these issues daily have developed more appropriate strategies. 13 Nosocomial spread of other communicable disease Where hospital hygiene is limited, and wards are crowded, the risk of transmission of communicable disease is high. The source may be an inadequately isolated index case, relatives who are staying in the hospital to provide food and general care for patients, or contaminated food or water in the hospital. Although from observation such transmission must occur, few such episodes have been recorded. Nosocomial outbreaks of cholera have been published from Tanzania and Mozambique and these reports suggest that outbreaks of other faecal-oral infections, particularly shigellosis, typhoid and hepatitis A and E, must also occur. 14, 15 Other reported hospital communicable disease outbreaks have included measles and non-typhoidal salmonellae. 16, 17 For communicable diseases in the tropics, the boundary between hospital and community infection is blurred. Among relatives camping within the hospital compound, there may be a case of undiagnosed tuberculosis? Is the infected person part of the community or part of the hospital? This distinction between public health and healthcare-related infection is particularly complex in the setting of refugee camps. 18, 19 Direct hospital acquired infections Studies of surgical and other hospital-related infections have been published from several countries in Africa, including Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso. 20e24 These studies show a similar pattern of pathogens that are seen globally; staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp., with high levels of antimicrobial resistance and a high and somewhat arbitrary use of antimicrobials. The studies are necessarily selective e only those hospitals in which there is a functioning microbiology laboratory, and which have sufficient staff, can undertake such work. In addition, with limited laboratory facilities, only the more easily culturable bacteria may be isolated and the results may give only a partial picture of the true prevalence and antimicrobial resistance patterns of pathogens.",

This raises one of the major areas of concern. In terms of hygiene facilities, crowding and laboratory support, many hospitals in the tropics are like those of the 'pre-penicillin era', yet within them are the multi-resistant bacteria of the twenty-first century. Data in many areas are limited or non-existent, but, where surveys have been done, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum b-lactamase-producing and other multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria have been shown to be widely disseminated. 27e31 The problem is compounded as antimicrobials, including quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins, are available without prescription, many areas have no laboratory facilities to provide accurate susceptibility data, and, despite several past attempts, there are no functioning international resistance surveillance programmes. 32, 33 Hospital infrastructure and facilities",
