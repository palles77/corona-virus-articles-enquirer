We disinfected surfaces contaminated with H1N1 influenza viruses using hydrogen peroxide (HP) vapor at concentrations below 100 ppm and triethylene glycol (TEG)-saturated air containing 2 ppm of TEG at 258C. MethodsInfluenza viruses in aqueous suspensions were deposited on stainless-steel coupons, allowed to dry at ambient conditions, and then exposed for up to 15 minutes to 10 to 90 ppm of HP vapor or TEG-saturated air. Virus assays were done on the solution used to wash the viruses from these coupons and from coupons treated similarly but without exposure to HP or TEG vapor. Results: After 2.5 minutes, exposure to 10-ppm HP vapor resulted in 99% inactivation. For air saturated with TEG at 25 to 298C, the disinfection rate was about 1.3 log 10 reductions per hour, about 16 times faster than the measured natural inactivation rate under ambient conditions. Conclusions: Vapor concentrations of 10 ppm HP or 2 ppm TEG can provide effective surface disinfection. At these low concentrations, the potential for damage to even the avionics of an airplane would be expected to be minimal. At a TEG vapor concentration of 2 ppm, there are essentially no health risks to people.",

We chose 2 methods that fulfilled these criteria: relatively low vapor concentrations (, 100 ppm) of hydrogen peroxide (HP) and very low vapor concentrations of triethylene glycol (TEG). The efficacy of HP and TEG is the subject of this study.

In the few published studies on surface disinfection of influenza viruses at higher HP concentrations, dried virus suspension was exposed to a relatively large dose of HP vapor; that is, HP vapor concentration was relatively high and exposure time was relatively long. None of these studies provided results on virus inactivation versus dose. For example, the effect of HP vapor on surface-deposited influenza viruses was evaluated by Heckert et al 7 at a HP vapor concentration of about 1200 ppm and an exposure time of about 30 minutes. Although they reported an overall reduction of influenza viruses of about 6 logs (base 10), which was their limit of detection, only about 3 logs were attributable to HP vapor; the remainder was due to 16 hours of drying at ambient conditions and heat exposure at 30 to 408C. Other studies using influenza as the challenge virus had similar limitations. In a recent review article, De Benedictis et al 8 concluded that reports on the specific efficacy against avian influenza viruses of hydrogen peroxide are contradictory; thus, additional information on its viricidal efficacy is needed.",

Although other glycols also can be used to disinfect air, 9, 10 TEG vapor is the most suitable because of its extremely low vapor pressure, which makes it effective at very low air concentrations. In addition, TEG in aerosol form is commonly used for theatrical ''smoke,'' such as in venues for Broadway productions. 11 Because of these and other properties, TEG vapor is believed to cause no harm to humans 12 and no damage to environmental surfaces. 13 There are numerous journal reports, primarily from the 1940s, on the use of TEG vapor for air disinfection. TEG vapor has been shown to exert lethal action against a wide variety of airborne infectious agents, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. 13 In particular, TEG vapor is an effective disinfectant agent for airborne influenza viruses. 14 ",

A fluorescent focus reduction assay 15 was used to measure virus titer before and after disinfection. For this assay, confluent monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were prepared in 96-well plates. Each well was inoculated with 50 mL of a virus suspension and incubated at 378C for 45 minutes in a 5% CO 2 environment. After infected cells were washed with an assay medium comprising Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (SeraCare, Milford, MA), the cells were incubated for 7 hours at 378C in a 5% CO 2 environment. After incubation, the cells were washed 3 times with Dulbecco's phosphate buffer saline with calcium and magnesium (DPBS11) (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and fixed with an aqueous solution of 80% acetone for 10 minutes at 48C. Infected MDCK cells were then labeled for 30 minutes at 48C with 50 mL of nucleoprotein antibody solution, which was made by adding 50 mL of mouse monoclonal antibodies (catalog no. VS2366; Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA) to 5 mL of Dulbecco's phosphatebuffered saline (DPBS) (Hyclone Laboratories) containing 1% BSA, 1% heat-inactivated human serum (Mediatech), and 0.02% sodium azide. After 3 washes with DPBS, the cells were incubated with tagging solution, made by adding 50 mL of rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (catalog no. 115026062; Jackson Immu-noResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) to 5 mL of DPBS containing 1% BSA, 1% heat-inactivated human serum, and 0.02% sodium azide. The number of cells with fluorescent foci, referred to as fluorescent focus units (FFUs), was then counted using an Olympus CKX-41 inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Based on this assay, the titer of the single-use packets of influenza virus suspension after thawing was about 10 9 FFUs/mL.",

In preparation for an experiment to measure the natural inactivation rate of influenza viruses, single-use packets of influenza virus suspension were thawed, separated into 200-mL portions, and then refrozen at -808C. At the start of a natural inactivation experiment, one of these 200-mL portions was thawed, and then each of 3 stainless steel coupons was seeded with 50 mL of virus suspension before being exposed to ambient indoor conditions in a small chamber without a disinfection agent present. After a predetermined time, another 200-mL portion was thawed, and 3 additional coupons were seeded and then placed in the chamber. This procedure was repeated multiple times. At the end of the experiment, the virus residue on each coupon was extracted, and all residues were assayed at the same time and in the same plate.",

It does not include experimental variability arising from replication of the experiment at a different time under the same set of operating conditions.

This calculation is based on the assumption that a single FFU detected from any of the 3 coupons exposed at a specific test condition corresponds to the limit of detection. Figure 1 shows the number of log 10 reductions based on eq (5) versus exposure time for experiments in which influenza viruses deposited on stainless steel coupons were exposed at approximately 258C and 58% to 65% RH to relatively low concentrations of HP vapor. In this figure, error bars correspond to 6 1 SD based on eq (6) . Even at a HP vapor concentration as low as 10 ppm, about a 2-log 10 reduction was observed after 2.5 minutes of exposure. But the number of log 10 reductions did not increase with increases in either exposure time or HP vapor concentration as much as would be predicted based on a linear relationship. If a HP vapor concentration of 10 ppm and an exposure time of 2.5 minutes were taken as the base, then increasing exposure time by a factor of 6 or increasing concentration by a factor of 9 added only an extra 1.6 log 10 and 1.3 log 10 reduction, respectively. For 15 minutes of exposure time, the highest measured disinfection rate was a 4.7 log 10 reduction at a HP vapor concentration of 90 ppm. An additional experiment, not shown in Figure 1 , in which influenza viruses were exposed at a HP vapor concentration of 57 ppm for 60 minutes resulted in a 5.6 log 10 reduction. Figure 2 shows the number of log 10 reductions based on eq (5) as a function of exposure time for experiments in which influenza viruses deposited on stainless steel coupons were exposed to air saturated with TEG at 25 to 298C and 45% to 55% RH. Based on eqs (1) and (2), the concentration of TEG vapor in these experiments ranged from 1.7 to 2.5 ppm. The error bars in Figure 2 correspond to 6 1 SD based on eq (6).

As exposure time increases, the log 10 reduction rate decreases significantly; thus, as shown in Figure 1 , the number of log 10 reductions for the initial 2.5 minutes of exposure exceeds the number of log 10 reductions from 2.5 to 15 minutes of exposure. This trend holds for all HP vapor concentrations evaluated. For example, at a HP vapor concentration of 90 ppm (the highest concentration tested), the number of log 10 reductions was 3.2 after 2.5 minutes of exposure, 4.5 after 10 minutes of exposure, and 4.7 after 15 minutes of exposure. Nonetheless, an important outcome of these tests was that during the initial 2.5 minutes of exposure to 10-ppm HP vapor, the number of log 10 reductions was equal to 2, or equivalently, a 99% reduction in virus. If the number of log 10 reductions at 10 ppm HP vapor versus exposure time were linear, then 15 minutes of exposure would have resulted in sterilization (12 log 10 reductions). Instead, because of the nonlinearity of the curve, only 3.6 log 10 reductions were measured after 15 minutes of exposure to 10-ppm HP vapor. This is a significant reduction for such a low HP vapor concentration. The 8-hour time-weighted average threshold limit value (TLV) 18 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration permissible exposure limit 19 for occupational HP vapor exposure are both 1 ppm. This suggests that 10-ppm HP vapor is a relatively safe concentration over a brief period, although the TLV includes the caveat that HP vapor is a confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans.",

If a pandemic were to occur, both surface and air disinfection could take place simultaneously even while people occupied the space. Although an objection could be raised due to the potential health risk of using TEG vapor for air disinfection, this concern is likely unwarranted, because TEG is an odorless chemical of no known toxicity, and human exposure to TEG is already widespread.

Based on a review of the available toxicology data, the Agency has concluded that triethylene glycol is of very low toxicity by the oral, dermal, and inhalation routes of exposure. The toxicology database is adequate to characterize the hazard of triethylene glycol, and no data gaps have been identified. There are no indications of special sensitivity of infants or children resulting from exposure to triethylene glycol.'' In addition, TEG has no known deleterious effects on fabrics or other surfaces. 13 Unlike HP vapor, TEG vapor is not an oxidizing agent. TEG inactivates viruses and bacteria because it is very hydroscopic; it condenses on bacteria-and virus-containing particles until its concentration becomes sufficiently high to be germicidal. 21, 22 It is reasonable to expect that the efficacy of TEG vapor will increase as its concentration is increased. At 258C, however, the concentration of TEG in air cannot exceed 1.7 ppm, because air is saturated at that concentration. The only way to increase concentration is to increase temperature. As shown in Table 1 , which was calculated from eqs (1) and (2), modest increases in temperature result in significant increases in TEG vapor concentration. For example, the concentration is more than 4 times higher at 358C (958F) than at 258C. Thus, further work investigating TEG vapor as a disinfecting agent is warranted. Specifically, the effectiveness of TEG vapor for surface disinfection at higher concentrations (ie, at temperatures above room temperature) should be investigated, and the influence of RH on the effectiveness of disinfection should be evaluated.
