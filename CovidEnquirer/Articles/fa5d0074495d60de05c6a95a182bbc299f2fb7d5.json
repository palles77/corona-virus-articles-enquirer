We have isolated and characterized revertants of ts24, a member of the A complementation group of Sindbis HR mutants, that we had demonstrated previously to have a temperature-sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis. These revertants of t&4 replicated efficiently at 40' but nevertheless retained the temperature sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis: they continued to synthesize minus strands late in the replication cycle at 40\" but not at 30\" and in the presence or absence of protein synthesis. Although failure to regulate the synthesis of minus strands resulted in continuous minus-strand synthesis and in the accumulation of minus strands, the rate of plus-strand synthesis was not increased concertedly. Minus strands synthesized after the rate of plus-strand synthesis had become constant were demonstrated to be utilized as templates for 26 S mRNA synthesis. Thus, the change from an increasing to a constant rate of plus-strand synthesis during the alphavirus replication cycle cannot be governed solely by the number of minus strands that accumulate in infected cells. We present a model for the preferential utilization of minus strands as a mechanism for the cessation of minus-strand synthesis that occurs normally during alphavirus replication.",

Replication of SIN virus requires the 49 S genome RNA to serve initially as a messenger RNA for the translation of viral encoded nonstructural proteins which function as components of a viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase transcribes the parental 49 S plus-strand RNA into a complementary 49 S minus-strand which is recognized in turn as a template by the RNA polymerase for the synthesis of additional plus strands. In addition to serving as a template for 49 S plus-strand RNA, the minus strand also serves as a template for the synthesis via internal initiation of a subgenomic plusstrand RNA that sediments at 26 S and is ' To whom requests for reprints should be addressed.",

Infected cultures were maintained at 30\" or 40\" from the beginning of infection and were pulse labeled with [3H]uridine for 30-min periods. At 30\u00b0, cells infected with SIN HR, ts24, and the two independently isolated revertants, ts24Rl and ts24R2, showed similar patterns of RNA synthesis (Fig. 1A ). There was a period when the rate of viral RNA synthesis increased followed by a period of a relatively constant rate of viral RNA synthesis. The increase in the labeling of RF RNA (the double-stranded core of the viral replicative intermediates) paralleled the overall increase in the rate of RNA synthesis. Minus-strand synthesis was readily detectable early in infection but was shut off late in infection. When the infection was at 40\", essentially no or very little viral RNA synthesis was detectable in ts24 infected cells (data not shown). However, cultures infected with SIN HR or ts24Rl or ts24R2 showed a similar pattern of viral RNA synthesis at 40\" compared to 30\". The rate of plus-strand RNA and RF RNA synthesis increased early in infection and changed to a relatively constant rate late in infection (Fig. 1B) . However, whereas the synthesis of minus-strand RNA had ceased by 4-5 hr p.i. in SIN HR infected cells, minus-strand synthesis continued at a high rate in cells infected with ts24Rl and ts24R2. Although minus-strand RNA synthesis continued at a relatively constant rate late in the replication cycle of ts24Rl and ts24R2, the rate of labeling of RF RNA and the rate of viral plus-strand synthesis remained at a constant rate (Fig. 1B) . The failure of the rate of plus-strand transcription to increase might result if the new minus-strands were unstable or did not function as templates in plus-strand synthesis. If they were unstable, minusstrands would not accumulate in infected cells; if they did not function as templates, minus-strands would not be found in replicative intermediates active in viral plusstrand synthesis.",

These results are in marked contrast to cells infected with SIN HR: almost no [3H]uridine was incorporated into minus strands after 4 hr p.i. at 40\" during a 2-hr labeling period either in the absence or presence of cycloheximide. Therefore, in ts24Rl infected cells newly made minus strands replaced at 40\" previously synthesized minus strands. This suggested that old minus strands accumulated as RF1 structures and was reminiscent of the turnover of poliovirus minusstrand RNA which accumulate as RF structures (Baltimore, 1968) . The rate of flow of newly synthesized minus strands into poliovirus RIs was similar to that observed for alphavirus minus strands early in infection (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1980) .

In contrast to SIN HR infected cells, when cells infected with ts24Rl were labeled with rH]uridine at 4 hr p.i. or later, labeled minus strands accumulated in RF RNA. However, instead of taking only 10 min, it took 60-90 min before 35% of the label in RF RNA was in minus strands. Therefore, the minus strands synthesized late in ts24Rl infected cells may enter a pool of previously synthesized minus strands before being utilized as templates for plus-strand synthesis or only some of the newly synthesized minus strands are utilized as templates for plus-strand synthesis. Thus, the ts defect in ts24 affecting minus-strand synthesis may reside in a function normally responsible for the stable association of alphavirus minus strands with an active replication complex.",

The synthesis of viral proteins at 40\" was clearly apparent, in the absence of hypertonic treatment, between 1.5 and 2 hr p.i., reaching maximal rates of synthesis at 4.5 to 5 hr p.i. In cells infected with both SIN HR or ts24R1, the synthesis of viral nonstructural proteins continued at a high rate late in infection. Furthermore, cells in-fected with ts24Rl synthesized greater amounts of the viral nonstructural proteins than did cells infected with SIN HR. The increased rate of synthesis of nonstructural proteins was related to a high level of 49 S RNA synthesis in the ts24Rl infected cells. However, in cells infected with SIN HR and in cells infected with ts24Rl the maximum rate of viral RNA synthesis was about the same and occurred at the same time (insert, Fig. 2A ). The large molecular weight precursors seen in the ts24Rl infected cells were also present, but in reduced amounts, in SIN HR infected cells. A similar increased production of the viral nonstructural proteins was also observed in ts24R2 infected cells (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1985) . DISCUSSION A summary of our analysis of the revertants of the three A complementation group mutants which possessed defects in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 loll 1213 FIG. 6. Protein synthesis in SIN HR and SIN HR ts24Rl infected cells. CEF cells were infected with 100 PFU/cell of SIN HR or ts24Rl and maintained at 40\" in the presence of actinomycin D. The cells were pulse labeled for 30 min with [%]methionine at 1.5 hr (lane 2), at 2.5 hr (lanes 3 and 8), 3.5 hr (lanes 4 and S), 4.5 hr (lanes 5 and lo), 5.5 hr (lanes 6 and ll), and 6.5 hr (lanes 7 and 12). Lanes 1 and 13 are of mock-infected cells. Lanes 2-7 are of SIN HR infected cells and lanes 8-12 are of SIN HR ts24Rl infected cells. The gel shown is an 8 to 12% Laemmli (1970) gel. is presented in Table 3 . All the revertants lost both the RNA-negative phenotype and the ts defect in cleavage of the ns230 polyprotein. The ts defects in synthesis of 26 S mRNA and in regulation of minus-strand synthesis were segregated independently from both the RNA-negative phenotype and the ts defect in ns230 cleavage (this report; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1985) . The ts133 revertant retained the ts defect in 26 S mRNA synthesis but regained the capacity to regulate minus-strand synthesis at 40'; the revertants of ts24 lost the ts defect in 26 S mRNA synthesis but retained the ts defect in the regulation of minusstrand synthesis. Thus, only in the revertants of ts24 was the ts defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis independent of all other ts phenotypes. Also, because the revertants of ts24 replicated efficiently at 40\", the inability to regulate alphavirus minus-strand synthesis was not of itself conditionally lethal.",

Continued synthesis of minus strands must have resulted either from reactivation of inactive replication com-plexes or from the replication complex exchanging a minus-strand template for a plus-strand template. Our results favor the latter interpretation because the rate of plus-strand synthesis does not increase in ts24Rl infected cells even though they accumulated two to four times more minus strands than SIN HR infected cells and continued to synthesize high levels of the nonstructural proteins. Friedman and Grimley (1969) , Scheele and Pfefferkorn (1969) , Ranki and Kaariainen (1970) , Bruton and Kennedy (19'75) , Wengler and Wengler (19'75) , and Sawicki and Sawicki (1980) demonstrated that the alphavirus replication complex, once formed, was stable and continued to synthesize plus strands in the absence of new protein synthesis. However, in ts24Rl or ts24R2 infected cells the continued synthesis and utilization of minus strands late in infection and in the absence of continued protein synthesis demonstrated that newly made minus strands replaced old minus strands. Normally minus strands would not be replaced by newly formed minus strands because minus-strand synthesis ceased late in infection or in the absence of protein synthesis.",

            "text": "Our original model (Sawicki et aL, 1981b) for the mechanism by which alphaviruses temporally regulate minus-strand synthesis involved a regulator whose activity re- --+ -sulted in the selective inactivation of replication complexes engaged in minusstrand synthesis and suggested that t&4 contained a ts mutation in the regulator. Although these studies do not rule out this model, another model which is equally attractive predicts that the preferred template of the viral polymerase is the minus strand. In the preferred template model, the accumulation of minus strands would lead eventually to replication complexes synthesizing exclusively plus strands because new replication complexes stop being formed late in infection or after treatment with cycloheximide. Mutations in ts17, t&4, ts133, and the revertants of ts24 allow for the continuation of minus-strand synthesis because at 40\", but not at 30\", the replication complex switches templates from a minus strand to a plus strand. This results in minus-strand synthesis with the newly synthesized minus strand being used preferentially as a template for plus-strand synthesis and the old minus strand becoming inactive. It will be important to determine if the mutations responsible for the ts regulation of minus-strand RNA synthesis are located in the viral polymerase (tram-acting) or in a &s-acting sequence of the viral RNA. Why did the overproduction of potentially functional minus strands in cells that were also synthesizing nonstructural proteins not result in increased rates of viral RNA synthesis? The overall rate of RNA synthesis might not be expected to increase if newly synthesized minus strands merely replaced old minus strands in replication complexes. This would occur if the number of replication complexes became fixed early during infection. Factors in addition to the nonstructural proteins and the number of minus strands appear to limit the rate of transcription late in infection. Host factors have been implicated as playing a role in alphavirus replication (Kowal and Stollar, 1981; Scheefers-Borchel et a& 1981; Baric et al, 1933) . However, because we find ( Fig.  2A, insert) that different stocks of a virus isolate caused different levels of viral RNA synthesis in the same host cells, we argue that host factors alone cannot be the determinant which sets the level of tran-scription in alphavirus infected cells. The results of our studies reemphasize the uniqueness of alphavirus replication when compared with that of picornaviruses (Baltimore, 1969) and coronaviruses (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1986) , both of which require continued protein synthesis for plusstrand as well as minus-strand RNA synthesis.",
