This procedure was adapted to the study of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) protein composition and RNA encapsidation. This protocol relies on virion capture by monoclonal antibodies specific for a virion membrane protein. These antibodies were bound to protein A-coated ELISA wells armed with rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies. As an example, the purification of 35 S-labelled TGEV virions was performed. The quality of virus preparations was assessed by quantifying common contaminating RNAs by real-time RT-PCR. The most critical factors influencing the purity degree are analysed and discussed.",

The study of virus composition relies on high quality virus preparations free of cellular contaminants. The most widely used protocol for virus purification is centrifugation through continuous sucrose gradients (Fields et al., 1996) . This method usually requires large amounts of infected-cell culture supernatants as a starting point, frequently harvested after extensive cytopathic effect. Therefore, contamination of virus preparations with proteins and nucleic acids stuck to the surface of virion particles is common. The purpose of this study is to provide a specific and rapid protocol for obtaining highly pure virus preparations, starting from low amounts (usually less than 5 ml) of infected-cell culture supernatants.",

TGEV virions present three structural levels ( Fig. 1 ) (Escors et al., 2001b) : (i) the envelope, in which the spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins are embedded; (ii) the internal core made of the nucleocapsid and the carboxy-terminus of the M protein; and (iii) the nucleocapsid, consisting of the positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome and the nucleoprotein (N) (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2000; Escors et al., 2001a; Penzes et al., 2001) . Virus composition and RNA encapsidation have been subjects of interest in our laboratory and virion immunocapture (immunopurification), frequently used as a diagnostic technique (Le Gall-Recul\u00e9 et al., 2001; Nolasco et al., 1993; Plakokefalos et al., 2000; Ptacek et al., 2002; Rimhanen-Finne et al., 2002; Sefc et al., 2000; Sharman et al., 2000; Wetzel et al., 1992) , has been a valuable tool. Accordingly, two topologies for the M protein in the envelope of TGEV virions have been characterized using the technique described in this protocol (Escors et al., 2001b) . Additionally, by the powerful combination of the specificity of immunopurification with the sensitivity of quantitative real-time RT-PCR, it has been demonstrated that TGEV mRNAs are not encapsidated into virus particles (Escors et al., 2003) , in contrast to previous publications using non-homogeneous virus preparations A scheme of the TGEV virion structure is shown. The TGEV particle is represented as a spherical particle made of a virus envelope (ENV) presenting a corona of peplomers made of the S protein (S). The envelope surrounds the internal core (IC) made of the virus RNA genome (RNA), the nucleoprotein (N) and the carboxy-terminus of the M protein in a Nexo-Cendo topology (M). M , membrane protein molecules adopting a Nexo-Cexo topology (Escors et al., 2001b) . E, small envelope protein.",

First, the source of TGEV virions used for immunopurifications (partially purified preparations or sucrose gradient purifications) was evaluated. In this example, the apparent mRNA-N encapsidation efficiencies were high, ranging from 20 to 30% compared to TGEV genome encapsidation in all cases (Table 1 ). The levels of cellular \u2424-actin mRNA varied from 1 to 8%, indicating that even after sucrose density gradients, all the preparations were contaminated with cellular and viral mRNAs (Table 1 ). In contrast, after immunopurification very low levels of mRNA-N were detected and \u2424-actin mRNA was not detected at all (Table 2) . TGEV virion preparations virtually free of mRNA-N and \u2424-actin mRNA were obtained when sucrose-gradient-purified virions were used in immunopurifications (Table 2) . When partially purified virions recovered at 14 hpi were used for immunopurification, very low levels of contaminating virus mRNA-N (0.8%) were detected (Table 2 ). These results show that a combination of sucrose gradients and immunopurification provides a high degree of purity. Virus preparations with the highest purification degree are obtained using previously purified virions, or partially purified virions harvested early in infection.",
