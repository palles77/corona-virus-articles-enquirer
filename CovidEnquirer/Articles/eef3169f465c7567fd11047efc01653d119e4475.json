            "text": "For several decades, the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Health Regulations ('IHR' or 'Regulations'), 1 formerly the WHO International Sanitary Regulations, were the primary global legal agreement against the international spread of infectious disease. While important, these prior Regulations were quite limited in scope, dealing primarily with three to six infectious diseases, but none of the new, emerging or reemerging diseases (including those that had become drug resistant), or other critical longstanding diseases. By the 1990s, the version of the Regulations adopted in 1969 had also become outdated in terms of policy and technical approach. 2 In the intervening decades, international travel and other traffic flows have increased sharply, and with them the opportunities for globalized disease spread. 3 To address these concerns, the World Health Assembly in 1995 4 commenced the process of revising the Regulations to update them in policy and technical aspects, and to broaden their scope to address the full range of internationally transmissible disease risks, whether currently known or as yet unknown. These newly revised IHR (2005) were adopted by the World  Health Assembly on 23 May 2005 5 and are now in  force and legally binding for 191 of WHO's 193  Member States; the last two Member States are  expected to become parties in August 2007 and in  early 2008. One of the important areas of innovation in the IHR (2005) involves their inclusion of explicit protections of the interests of individuals within the scope of this agreement, primarily with reference to international 'travellers' (defined in the Regulations as a 'person undertaking an international voyage') in a range of circumstances. This subject was one of the key parts of the negotiations of the WHO Member States resulting in the revised Regulations negotiations. The importance of these protections for national delegations in the negotiations is underlined by the placement of human rights as the first 'principle' articulated in Paragraph 1 of Article 3 of the Regulations, requiring that the 'implementation of these Regulations shall be with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons'.",

More specifically, the fundamental term 'disease' is defined as 'an illness or medical condition, irrespective of origin or source that presents or could present significant harm to humans'. As indicated in Table 1 , the definitions of other key terms, such as 'event' and 'public health risk', are similarly broad.

Under the revised IHR (2005), with the expanded coverage of disease, the scope of regulation of health measures applicable to international travellers is also broadened in light of the many covered diseases that may be spread by persons on an international voyage.

In 2005, according to the World Tourism Organization, there were more than 800 million international tourist arrivals. Overall, the numbers of travellers (international tourist arrivals) to each region were substantial: Africa, 36.7 million; Americas, 133.5 million; Asia and Pacific, 155.4 million; Europe, 441.5 million; and the Middle East, 39.1 million. The areas of greatest growth in international tourist arrivals were Africa (+9%), Asia and Pacific (+8%), and the Middle East (+8%). 6 Health measures applicable to travellers As noted, the IHR (2005) provide for a range of health measures potentially applicable to international travellers depending upon the particular circumstances and requirements. Specific examples include: physical/medical examinations; health document requirements (including proof of vaccination or prophylaxis); certain types of itinerary and contact information; vaccination/prophylaxis; inspection of baggage; placing persons under public health observation; and the possibility of quarantine or isolation. Additional provisions address when international travellers may be denied entry to a country on public health grounds. In the context of an event that has been determined by the Director-General of WHO to be a public health emergency of international concern, Article 15 provides that the Director-General will also issue specific temporary recommendations under the IHR (2005) of appropriate health measures to prevent or reduce spread of the disease and interference with international traffic. In Article 18, the Regulations contain a non-exclusive list of 13 potentially relevant recommendations applicable to persons as appropriate to the circumstances (as well as others for baggage, cargo, containers and conveyances), from advice that no specific measures are appropriate, to advice that States require vaccination or prophylaxis, to recommending implementation of contact tracing or potential exit screening or other restrictions on persons from affected areas.

In more concrete terms, the article specifically requires that States Parties minimize this discomfort or distress by 'providing or arranging for adequate food and water, appropriate accommodation and clothing, protection for baggagey, appropriate medical treatment, means of necessary communicationy and other appropriate assistance for travellers who are quarantined, isolated or subject to medical examinations or other procedures for public health purposes'.

This was another intensely debated set of issues during the negotiations. In general, the IHR (2005) requirements distinguish between charges for vaccinations or prophylaxis provided on arrival (which are not generally prohibited from being charged to the traveller under the Regulations unless the charges were not published at least 10 days earlier) and certain other measures that may generally not be charged to the traveller, such as medical examinations under the Regulations or supplemental examinations required to ascertain the traveller's health status, appropriate isolation or quarantine requirements, any certificates issued to a traveller documenting the measures applied, health measures applied to baggage, and vaccination or other prophylaxis requirements that were not published in advance as required. In addition, where such charges are permitted, each State Party must have a single tariff for them, they may not exceed the actual cost of the service rendered, and the charge must not discriminate based upon nationality, domicile or residence of the traveller concerned. However, these restrictions on charges do not apply to travellers seeking temporary or permanent residence or to charges for health measures that are not implemented primarily for a public health purpose.",

A further set of issues concerns identification of those who are subject to these provisions in the Regulations. As noted, under the IHR (2005), 'travellers' are, by definition, international (i.e. 'undertaking an international voyage'). Most of the above provisions, but not all of them (the general 'principle' in Article 3.1 refers to 'persons'), refer to treatment of 'travellers'. Although it may not turn out to be an issue in 'real life', there may be questions about the status of particular individuals (see definition of 'international voyage' applicable to travellers). Theoretically at least, a related set of issues may arise in events involving both (international) travellers, to whom the IHR (2005) would generally apply, as well as local nationals, perhaps those in or near a port or airport. Separately, it should be noted that some of these provisions exclude travellers who are seeking temporary or permanent residence from the otherwise broader category of travellers covered under the Regulations, as in Article 31.1 (concerning health-related entry requirements for travellers) and Article 35 (concerning requirements for health documents in international travel).",

These Regulations contain a broad range of binding provisions to address the risks of international disease spread in international travel, trade and transportation. Important elements include multiple provisions, whether denominated in terms of human rights or other terminology, that are protective of interests of individuals who may be subject to public health measures in this international context. With the vast (and increasing) numbers of persons undertaking international voyages and the global coverage of these revised Regulations, they are an important development in this area. This article describes a number of these key provisions and some of the related issues they present. & 2007 on behalf of The Royal Institute of Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One issue is how these provisions may be considered in the context of other existing relevant international instruments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 7,8 particularly with regard to the more general provisions in the IHR (2005), including Article 3.1 (principle) and Article 32 (treatment of travellers) noted above. This is further complicated by the text in a number of relevant articles providing that States Parties may take certain steps '[s]ubject to applicable international agreements', including, for example, Article 23 (health measures on arrival and departure). Article 57.1 of the Regulations provides that the IHR (2005) are to be 'interpreted so as to be compatible' with these other instruments, and that the Regulations 'do not affect the rights and obligations of any State Party' under them.",
