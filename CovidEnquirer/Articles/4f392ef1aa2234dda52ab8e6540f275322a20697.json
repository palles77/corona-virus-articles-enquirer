Coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), fuse at the plasma membrane or use receptor-mediated endocytosis and fuse with endosomes depending on the cell or tissue type. The virus Spike (S) protein mediates fusion with the host cell membrane. We have shown previously that an Abl kinase inhibitor, imatinib, significantly reduces SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viral titers and prevents endosomal entry by HIV SARS S and MERS S pseudotyped virions. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are classified as BSL-3 viruses, which can make experimentation into the cellular mechanisms involved in infection more challenging. Here, we use IBV, a BSL-2 virus, as a model for studying the role of Abl kinase activity during coronavirus infection. We found that imatinib and two specific Abl kinase inhibitors, GNF2 and GNF5, reduce IBV titers by blocking the first round of virus infection. Additionally, all three drugs prevented IBV S-induced syncytia formation prior to the hemifusion step. Our results indicate that membrane fusion (both virus-cell and cell-cell) is blocked in the presence of Abl kinase inhibitors. Studying the effects of Abl kinase inhibitors on IBV will be useful in identifying host cell pathways required for coronavirus",

            "text": "Based on results from our previous report, we hypothesize that Abl kinase activity is required for entry of other coronaviruses, presumably for virus-cell fusion. The classification of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as BSL-3 pathogens and SARS-CoV as a select agent, presents a barrier to the experimental methods that can be performed with the live viruses. Additionally, membrane composition of pseudotyped virions differs from that of true virions since pseudotyped virions bud from the plasma membrane while true virions bud from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (21, 22) . This could lead to differences in virus-cell fusion and entry mechanisms. Because of this, it is important to evaluate these effects in a live virus system and it is advantageous to find a BSL-2 coronavirus that can be used as a model of infection. Here, we report the effects of imatinib and two other Abl kinase inhibitors, GNF2 and GNF5, on IBV infection. We show that the Abl kinase inhibitors interfere with the first round of IBV infection, indicating an inhibition of virus-cell fusion. In addition, we directly demonstrate that cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation mediated by IBV S is inhibited by imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 prior to hemifusion, suggesting a role for Abl kinases in both virus-cell and cell-cell fusion events. IBV will be an excellent model to determine the mechanism of Abl kinase action during coronavirus entry in order to find new targets for therapeutic intervention. Plasmids. pCAGGS/SARS-CoV S and pCAGGS/VSV G were previously described (24, 25) . the RRFRR furin cleavage site between S1 and S2) were PCR amplified from a cDNA vector containing codon-optimized sequence of IBV S1, and nucleotides 1614-2955 flanked by HindIII and XmaI sites were PCR amplified from cDNA containing the codon-optimized sequence of IBV S2 (27, 28) . QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent Genomics) was used to remove the HindIII restriction site between S1 and S2 once the amplicons had been ligated together, and the full coding sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing.",

Similar to infection, we observed formation of syncytia containing an average of 16 nuclei when Vero cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding IBV S ( Figure 5A, B) . Treating IBV S-transfected cells with Abl kinase inhibitors significantly reduced the number of nuclei per syncytium to ~4 nuclei for imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5, an ~80% reduction ( Figure 5A, B) . Because SARS-CoV is also inhibited by imatinib (12), we wanted to determine whether Abl kinase inhibitors interfere with fusion induced by SARS-CoV S. To this end, we also tested the effects of all three drugs on syncytia formation produced by the SARS-CoV S protein. Vero cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding SARS-CoV S. The number of nuclei per syncytium was reduced 40% by imatinib, 50% by GNF2 or and 60% by GNF5, as compared to the number of nuclei per syncytium in untreated cells ( Figure 5C, D) . Average syncytium size induced by SARS-CoV S was much smaller than that induced by IBV S (7 nuclei and 16 nuclei per syncytium, respectively), but treatment with all three drugs did reduce the average to three nuclei per syncytium for both IBV S and SARS-CoV S. Note that treatment with Abl kinase inhibitors not only reduced the number of nuclei per syncytium, but also total number of syncytia. We did not quantify this observation, but while more than 50 syncytia containing greater than or equal to three nuclei were found in control cells, we routinely found fewer than 10 syncytia in drugtreated samples. Additionally, there are only two data points for the SARS-CoV S, imatinibtreated cells due to the fact that no syncytia were found in one of the replicate experiments.

The fact that we see the same phenotype with SARS-CoV S and IBV S reinforces the idea that IBV can be used as a model coronavirus to study Abl kinase involvement in coronavirus infection.",

            "text": "We have demonstrated here that the Abl kinase inhibitors, imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 reduce the viral titer of IBV by decreasing the number of cells infected, and that the first round of virus infection is inhibited. Our data show that each of the three inhibitors prevents syncytia formation induced by IBV as indicated by fewer nuclei per syncytium as compared to infected, untreated cells. A decrease in nuclei per syncytium in IBV S-and SARS-CoV S-expressing cells treated with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 demonstrates Abl kinase inhibitors prevent syncytia formation induced by the S protein in the absence of other viral proteins. Our results demonstrate that fusion was inhibited before the hemifusion step, prior to any lipid mixing of membranes. Additionally, we show that cleavage of S into S2 and S2' was not affected by imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5, suggesting that IBV S processing and cleavage is independent of Abl kinase activity. The inhibition by specific inhibitors of Abl kinases, GNF2 and GNF5, strongly suggests that IBV infection requires the activity of Abl1 and/or Abl2. Our previous report showed that Abl2, but not Abl1, is required for entry of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (37) . They are involved in T cell signaling (38, 39) , embryonic development and (6, 40) , and cell migration and invasion in cancer (41, 42) . The distinct domains provide Abl kinases with the ability to act as scaffolds to facilitate building of signaling complexes (6, 43, 44) , and to regulate protein function through phosphorylation of downstream protein targets (43) . Binding actin through the FABD directly regulates cytoskeleton dynamics (44) (45) (46) (47) to activate the essential cellular pathways described above.

This work strongly suggests that proteins involved in the Abl kinase pathway are excellent targets for developing treatments for coronavirus infections. Current studies are underway to determine the Abl kinase functions involved in coronavirus infection as well as determining whether the activity of Abl1 or Abl2, or both kinases is required for coronavirus .

Given the role Abl kinases play in infection by so many other viruses makes this pathway a prime target for use in developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics.",

Vero cells were pre-treated for 1 h with 10 \u00b5M imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5. Cells were adsorbed for 1 h with IBV at an MOI of 0.1 in the presence of DMSO or drug. (A) Supernatants were harvested and used for plaque assays to determine viral titer. (B) Immunofluorescence staining of the IBV S protein was used to count the number of infected cells in the presence of DMSO or drug. > 1,000 cells were analyzed per experimental condition in three independent experiments, and % of cells infected was calculated by comparing the number of infected cells to the number of total cells analyzed. Error bars represent standard error and p values were calculated using a paired t test. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.

To label total IBV S and SARS S proteins, at the indicated times post-infection or post-transfection, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with block/perm buffer (PBS + 10% FBS, 0.05% Saponin, 10 mM glycine, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4) and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies (rabbit anti-IBV S diluted 1:500, rabbit anti-SARS S diluted 1:500 in block/perm buffer) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS + 10 mM glycine and stained with secondary Alexa Fluor antibodies (diluted 1:1000 in block/perm buffer) for 15 min at room temperature.Cells were washed with PBS + glycine and DNA stained with Hoescht 33258. To label cell surface IBV S, intact cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, incubated 30 min on ice in block/perm buffer (without saponin) and incubated with mouse anti-IBV S (1:10) for 1 h on ice. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed and permeabilized as, and stained for total IBV S with rabbit anti-IBV S, and DNA as described above. Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axioscop microscope (Thornwood, NY) equipped for epifluorescence with a Sensys charge-coupled-device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), using IPLab software (Scanalytics, Vienna, VA). Images are shown inverted for better visualization of the IBV S, dsRed and YFP-GPI signals. Plaque assay. Vero cells were seeded at 5 x 10 5 per dish in 35 mm dishes 24 h prior to infection. Supernatants from infected cells were serially diluted 10 -1 through 10 -6 in serum-free medium. Cells were washed with serum-free medium, 200 \u00b5l of diluted virus was added to each well and adsorption was allowed to proceed for 1 hour at 37 o C with gentle rocking every 10 minutes. 2X DMEM and 1.6% agarose were mixed 1:1 and allowed to cool to 37 o C. Cells were washed with SF medium, and 2 ml DMEM-agarose was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 72 hours at 37 o C. DMEM-agarose was removed from each well, crystal violet staining was used to visualize plaques, and pfu/ml was calculated for each sample. Fusion Assay. HeLa and Vero cells were plated 3.5x10 5 in 35 mm dishes 24 hr prior to transfection. HeLa cells were transfected as described above with 2 \u00b5g pCAGGS-IBV S and 0.5 \u00b5g of a plasmid encoding YFP-GPI anchor (Clontech) and Vero cells were transfected with 0.5 \u00b5g of a plasmid encoding dsRed (Clontech). Twenty-four h post-transfection, Vero cells were trypsinized and re-plated at 3.5 x 10 5 in 35 mm dishes on coverslips and grown for 1 h in 10 \u00b5M imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 and an equal volume of DMSO. An equal volume of HeLa cells was then added to each well of Vero and DMSO or drug was added to maintain treatment conditions. Twenty-four h later, cells were placed on ice. On ice, cells were incubated for 20 min in block/perm buffer as described previously (without saponin). A rabbit anti-GFP antibody and mouse anti-IBV S (1:500, 1 h on ice) were used to label surface YFP-GPI and IBV S, respectively. Cells were then fixed for 10 min in 3% PFA at RT, and all following steps were carried out at RT. Cells were washed with PBS and then permeabilized with block/perm buffer (0.05% saponin). Cells were washed and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit and Cy5 anti-mouse were used for secondary labeling of YPF-GPI and IBV S, respectively. Hoescht 33258 was used to stain DNA. All images were taken within 24 h with the same exposure as described above. Physical contact between Vero and HeLa cells was defined as an event. Each event was classified either as hemifusion or full fusion. For each treatment condition, total events were normalized to 100% and hemifusion events were normalized to the total number of events. IBV S processing analysis. Vero cells were plated 5x10 4 per well in 35 mm dishes and 24 h later infected with IBV at MOI 0.1. Eighteen h post-infection supernatants were collected and virus was concentrated by layering 1 ml of supernatant onto 2 ml of a 20% sucrose cushion, and centrifuged for 1 h at 90K xg and 4 o C in a TLA110 rotor. The supernatant was removed and samples resuspended and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4 to 12% acrylamide gradient gels (NUPAGE, ThermoFisher). Proteins were transferred to low fluorescence PVDF membrane (source) and blocked for 1 h in 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST) (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Hcl [pH 7.4], 0.05% Tween-20). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 o C with rabbit anti-IBVS antibody 1:500 in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST. Membranes were washed 3 x 5 min in",

            "text": "immediately after adsorption, infection proceeded normally and viral titers matched those in untreated cells (Figure 3B t1, 3C imat 1h). However, when imatinib was present up to 1 h postadsorption during virus fusion and entry, viral titers decreased significantly (Figure 3B t2, 3C imat 2 h). Similar to results in Figure 2, imatinib treatment for the duration of infection decreased IBV titers ~ 80% (Figure 3B). We also observed a decrease in the number of cells infected when imatinib was present in the cell culture medium for at least 1 h after adsorption (Figure 3C, imatinib 2 h). This result suggests that imatinib does not affect virus binding to host cell receptors, but does interfere with virus entry. The results from these experiments demonstrate that Abl kinase inhibitors prevent the first round of infection by IBV, potentially through interference with virus-cell fusion.Abl kinase inhibitors prevent virus-induced syncytia formationInfection of Vero cells by IBV leads to cell-cell fusion and formation of multinucleated syncytia.

A previous report demonstrated that imatinib inhibits HIV env-induced cellcell fusion at a post-hemifusion step, as indicated by an accumulation of hemifusion events observed in imatinib-treated cells (15). To determine whether imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 inhibit IBV S-induced cell-cell fusion pre-or post-hemifusion, we used an assay similar to that used for HIV to distinguish hemifusion from full fusion events. HeLa cells were transfected with one plasmid encoding IBV S and a second encoding YFP targeted to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (YFP-GPI). After transfection, these cells were co-cultured with Vero cells transfected with a plasmid expressing soluble dsRed. Hemifusion between a HeLa and a Vero cell results in both cells containing the GPI anchor at the plasma membrane, with cytoplasmic dsRed signal observed in only one of the two cells. Full cell-cell fusion results in both cells with cytoplasmic dsRed signal and containing the labeled GPI anchor at the plasma membrane.
