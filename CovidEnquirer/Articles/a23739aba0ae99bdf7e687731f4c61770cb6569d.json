Associated developments in technologies for virus detection 9 have facilitated their epidemiological characterisation. Despite these advances, it remains the case that no known respiratory virus can be identified in 30-40% of all ARI episodes, suggesting that additional respiratory pathogens are likely to exist. 10, 11 In support of this notion, a number of previously undescribed viruses have been identified by analysis of clinical specimens from the human respiratory tract since 2001: human metapneumovirus, 12 SARS coronavirus, 13 coronavirus NL63, 14 coronavirus HKU1, 15 human bocaviruses, 16 novel rhinoviruses 3 and the recently described KI and WU polyomaviruses. 17, 18 Several of the authors have previously reported on the community epidemiology of viral acute respiratory infections in a cohort of children <5 years of age. 19 Within a large, industry-sponsored vaccine trial, we conducted a study of the viral aetiology of respiratory tract infections experienced by healthy, community dwelling adults reporting symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI).",

For isolates with undetectable virus, we cannot distinguish between inadequate sampling from the participant, issues relating to transport of the sample, or presence of an unknown virus. Picornaviruses were the most common viruses observed followed by influenza. While influenza was only confirmed in approximately 2% of the placebo-group participants, the 2008 influenza season in Australia was particularly mild, following on from the notably severe 2007 seasonal epidemic. 30 Given this, however, we do acknowledge that under-ascertainment may have occurred as a result of subclinical infections and potential failure of participants to report mild symptoms, despite intensive follow-up. Consistent with expectations and findings in healthy children in which influenza was associated with higher severity, 31 here influenza was associated with a higher composite 'symptom score'. Vaccination provided partial protection against ILI associated with influenza, but there was no evidence of disease modification (as measured by Viruses associated with ILI in healthy adults \u00aa 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd symptom score) in participants with breakthrough symptomatic infection. We speculate that this may be due to infection with a strain of influenza not covered by the vaccine. In a further study of household transmission (in preparation) using the Questionnaire data set, we find further evidence consistent with this hypothesis, although without further virus typing, cannot subject our hypothesis to further scrutiny. The observed association between vaccination and isolation of picornaviruses perhaps suggests that picornaviruses are filling the niche vacated by exclusion of influenza owing to vaccination, consistent with the hypothesis of viral interference. 32 Support for the association is present during and following the influenza season but not prior to the season, consistent with an interference effect, although we cannot exclude other explanations, including simple statistical fluctuation.",

Participants were selected to be 'healthy', without underlying conditions that would have resulted in a routine recommendation for annual influenza vaccination, given the placebo-controlled study design. The study population varies from the general population, being younger, less likely to smoke and more likely to be women. Furthermore, the study population who returned a questionnaire, enabling an examination of symptom score, was further biased towards women and those 35 years and over. Two-thirds of participants were immunised against influenza, associated with the anticipated reduction in influenza cases in the vaccinated proportion. Swabs were only collected from individuals presenting for ILI evaluation, and not from a 'control' population. This limited our ability to 35 showed a similar overall rate for virus detection (43%) in those ILI's submitted for swabbing (46% of all ILIs reported by the GPs in the study), despite a smaller number of viruses tested for. In that study, 29% of all specimens were positive for influenza, compared with 11% here. The mix of viruses detected in the 83 participants in our study who presented to a GP was similar to the full data set (data not shown). These discrepancies perhaps reflect the non-specific nature of the ILI definition used in our study or a potential bias in the ILIs chosen to be swabbed by the GPs in the study by Grant et al. 35 Compared with a case-control study of respiratory viruses involved with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) conducted in Melbourne, Australia, our overall rate of virus detection was higher (21% of exacerbations in that study) and the distribution of viruses, with a preponderance of picornaviruses and influenza similar. 36 That study confirmed far greater odds of virus detection in individuals with symptoms than matched controls, providing prior evidence of the aetiological role of viruses in illness exacerbations, as did a similar study in Germany where picornaviruses, influenza and RSV most commonly caused disease. 37 Among patients with COPD in Belfast, rhinoviruses and adenovirus were most frequently associated with increasing respiratory difficulty. 38 A study in a similar patient population in Hong Kong revealed a far lower burden of picornaviruses (rhinovirus), perhaps reflecting true differences in epidemiology, or differing sensitivity of detection methods. 39 Our findings add to an evolving knowledge base regarding the experience of a range of respiratory viruses in Australia. 19, 40 In particular, they confirm a distinction between influenza and other pathogens (as measured by a symptom score) even among healthy individuals, which has led to calls for expansion of funded immunisation recommendations in Australia to reduce the spread of disease. 41 More data such as ours are required to fill existing knowledge gaps regarding the community burden of disease to inform more robust estimates of the likely cost-effectiveness of such strategies. 42 In further work, we will consider the household-level impact of infection introduction, by examining patterns of secondary transmission described in participant questionnaires. Having identified specimens testing negative for all known viruses, the next phase of this project involves discovery of hitherto unknown respiratory viruses using broad-range viral molecular detection methods.",
