The pathogenesis of MERS is partially revealed in this investigation by identification of the target organ, lung, and the target cells, type 2 pneumocytes and bronchial submucosal glands, the likely source of virus that results in person-to-person transmission. The study also strongly supports dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as the host receptor for the virus. The truth-testing of this human autopsy highlights the valid and discordant characteristics of animal models in nonhuman primates, transgenic mice expressing the host receptor for MERScoronavirus (CoV), and rabbits. The long interval between the emergence of this dangerous disease 3 years ago and the first autopsy reminds us of the lost opportunity that the decline of the performance of autopsies, particularly research-oriented postmortem examinations in the United States, represents.",

After >8000 cases with a 10% case fatality rate, severe acute respiratory syndrome was controlled and has not reappeared. In contrast, MERS appeared in the Middle East in 2012 with most cases occurring in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and continues to reemerge from its amplifying host, camels, with both camel-to-human and nosocomial and household contact human-to-human transmission occurring. 2,3 MERS has spread to at least 24 other countries, including the United States and South Korea, where >180 cases arose from a single infected individual who had returned from travel to the Middle East. 4 Although MERS occurs in only 4% of household contacts, nosocomial outbreaks occur particularly when infection control measures are deficient. Thus, although the average number of cases generated from one infected individual with MERS is <0.7, indicating that person-to-person spread dies out, the occurrence of new cases of camel-tohuman transmission continues.",

In fact, MERS is diagnosed most often in elderly men and individuals with comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, chronic cardiac disease, hypertension, chronic pulmonary disease, and obesity, and individuals who are immunocompromised. The clinical manifestations of MERS are principally respiratory. The symptoms are nonspecific, including fever, chills, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea. Clinical worsening over a few days leads to respiratory failure with diffuse rales and radiographic abnormalities similar to other viral pneumonias and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients also manifest tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. Patients often develop acute renal failure and gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain. The main mode of transmission remains unknown, although it appears to be via large droplets of respiratory secretions and direct contact, although airborne transmission may also play a role.",

No MERS-CoV infection was detected in the kidney, and no acute renal lesions were present, which contrasts with the rare detection of viral RNA in urine of patients. 5 Acute renal failure is a frequent manifestation of severe cases of MERS as occurred in this patient, but the pathophysiologic explanation would appear more likely to be the effects of hypotension on renal function rather than direct viral infection of the kidney, at least in this case. Similarly, the absence of infection in the intestines contrasts with the rare detection of viral RNA in stool and suggests that nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which occur not infrequently in patients with MERS, are unlikely to be caused by viral infection of the gastrointestinal tract. 5 Many in vitro studies of MERS-CoV infection of various cell types were performed and interpreted to suggest viral tropism for various organs for which the autopsy study provided no support. For example, in vitro infection of dendritic cells and macrophages has resulted in dysregulation in the production of cytokines and antigen presentation, and infection of T lymphocytes induced apoptosis. 6 The observations reported in the spleen and lymph nodes of this case do not support the relevance of these studies in human infection. Of course, these conclusions could change with further studies of larger series of cases of MERS.",

An appropriate animal model of an infectious disease should represent the clinical course, organ tropism of the agent, cellular tropism of intracellular agents such as viruses, and pathologic lesions of the human disease after inoculation of an appropriate dose of the agent by the appropriate route that represents the most likely mode of transmission and portal of entry of the agent. There should be an incubation period and duration of illness that agree reasonably with the human course of infection and dosedependent severity, including ideally sublethal and lethal doses. DPP4, the host cell receptor for MERS-CoV, 7 varies among animal species with the receptors of mice, ferrets, and hamsters failing to bind the virus, rendering these species resistant to infection in contrast with the receptors of camels, humans, rhesus monkeys, common marmosets, and rabbits which bind the virus, making the animals susceptible to infection.",

A subsequent study of MERS-CoV infection in common marmosets found sublethal mild-to-moderate respiratory disease with no recovery of infectious virus or detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR or viral antigens by immunohistochemistry, modest radiographic evidence of pulmonary disease, and multifocal interstitial pneumonia with few syncytial cells. 10 Both studies found clinical respiratory disease, although differing in severity of illness and virologic results.

Pulmonary histopathology progressed from mild multifocal perivascular, peribronchial, and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates on day 2 to a peak on day 8. Beginning on day 6 the brain contained pathologic lesions, including perivascular cuffing, apoptotic bodies, microglial activation, and mild meningitis. This transgenic mouse model effectively represents dose-dependent lethal and sublethal MERS-CoV pneumonia with dose-dependent incubation and appropriate pulmonary target cells. Disseminated infection and pathology in the brain were not observed in the human autopsy report; thus, they diverge from the current knowledge of what an ideal model should contain.
