This observation suggests a vital function of the native conformation of the Sl protein in both antigenic structure and intracellular transport. Antigenic determinants A and B were not distinguished, but these determinants appeared to require both domains for epitope formation.

The function of this additional sequence present in the BCV Sl subunit is not yet clearly defined. However, recent studies have identified a region of 142 to 159 amino acids similar to the BCV Sl additional sequence in the N-terminal half (Sl counterpart) of the spike glycoprotein of wild type MHV-4 coronavirus . This region is highly polymorphic in different neutralization resistant MHV-4 variants, suggesting its important role in MHV-4 pathogenicity. Considerable homology in the amino acid sequences between the Sl subunits of MHV-4 and BCV suggests that the additional sequence of amino acid residues 456-592 within the BCV Sl subunit may be a polymorphic domain similar to that found in MHV-4. Recently, individual subunits of the BCV S glycoprotein have been expressed in insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses, and two major BCV neutralizing epitopes were localized to the Sl subunit .",

To determine the conformational changes of the mutant polypeptides, we attempted to measure the relative rates of secretion of the mutant Sl polypeptides. It has been established that native conformation is essential for transport of proteins through intracellular secretory pathways (for a review, see Rose and Doms, 1988) . Secretion of the BCV Sl subunit protein from insect cells has been previously demonstrated . Insect cells producing the mutant Sl polypeptides were labeled for 12 hr begining at 24 hr postinfection and the secreted polypeptides in the medium were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4) . At 36 hr postinfection, no Apt product was detected in the medium (Fig. 4B, lane 4) even though the Apt product was present in the cell pellet (Fig. 4A, lane 4) . Similarly, deletion AV was present in the cell lysate in large quantities (Fig. 4A, lane 6 ), but only a trace amount was detected in the medium (Fig. 4B, lane 6) . In contrast, other polypeptides, Apu, Alll, and AVI and the intact Sl protein were efficiently secreted into the media (Fig. 4B , lanes 2, 5, 7, 8). A significant amount of the truncated Abx polypeptide also accumulated in the medium (Fig. 4B , lane 3) even though the amount of intracellular Abx was small (Fig. 4A, lane 3) . These observations indicate that extracellular transport of the Apt and AV was significantly inhibited, suggesting the altered conformation of mutants Apt and AV.",

This can be achieved by either synthetic peptide technology (Geysen eT al., 1984) or alternatively by expressing DNA fragments generated by DNase or restriction enzymes in Escherichia co/i (Mehra et a/., 1984; Nunberg et al., 1986) . Such an approach has been utilized for the identification of continuous epitopes of the spike glycoproteins of mouse hepatitis coronavirus (Talbot et al., 1988; Luy-tjes et a/., 1989) infectious bronchitis virus (Lenstra et al., 1989) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Delmas et a/., 1990; Correa et al., 1990) . However, attempts to study conformational epitopes using synthetic peptides or prokaryotic expression systems often result in the inability of antibodies to recognize these recombinant proteins or peptides (Delmas et al., 1990) . This problem is most probably due to the lack of proper posttranslational modification and consequently resulting in altered protein conformation.",

This overlapping region (domain The results established that the BCV antigenic determinants A and B are located in a segment between residues 324 and 720 (Fig. 7, B) . Formation of the determinants A and B appeared to be dependent upon two separate domains. One of the domains was localized within residues 325-403, approximately 50 amino acids upstream from the probable BCV polymorphic region. The other domain was identified within residues 517-720, which included the carboxyl half of the probable BCV polymorphic region (Fig. 7, C) . Earlier studies mapped BCV antigenic determinants A and B to a 37K tt-ypsin fragment generated by proteolysis of antigen-antibody complexes (Deregt et a/., 1989) . Based upon the potential hydrophilic trypsin cleavage sites of the amino acid sequence, the proteolytic cleavage patterns generated with three specific proteolytic enzymes, and other considerations such as the number of glycosylation sites, 37K fragment was tentatively suggested to extend from residues 351 (after Arg at 350) to 621 (Lys) of the Sl subunit (Fig. 7, D) (Deregt, 199 .

One or more of these three cysteines may be involved in the formation of the antigenic determinants by forming disulfide linkages.

            "text": "Recently, have identified a polymorphic region on the Sl subunit in MHV-4. This region has been demonstrated to undergo deletions or more frequently, point mutations. Furthermore, these point mutations were selectable by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, and the mutant viruses displayed decreased virulence, indicating that the polymorphic region is directly involved in the MHV-4 pathogenicity (Gallagher et al., 1990) . We have mapped BCV antigenie determinants A and B to residues 324-720, and this segment includes the probable BCV polymorphic region (Fig. 7, B) . Even though it is not clear whether determinants A and B reside on domains I and/or II, or on the third region, the probable BCV polymorphic region (Fig. 7, A) seems to be associated with these antigenie determinants since the probable polymorphic region is comprised of the most part of domain II and the region between two domains (Fig. 7 , B, C, E). Sequence homology with perfectly conserved cysteine residues in the polymorphic region between BCV and MHV-4 and the involvement of this region in BCV antigenicity (Fig. 7, B, D) further support the association of BCV antigenic determinants with the probable polymorphic region. Since no potential glycosylation sites are found in this region (Fig. 7) , glycosylation of the Sl protein does not seem to be directly involved in the proper formation of the antigenic determinants. This is in agreement with the previous finding that unglycosylated forms of the Sl protein were recognized by both groups of monoclonal antibodies . This portion of the Sl subunit contains 15 cysteine residues (Fig. 7) and manyp-turns as revealed by secondary structure analysis (data not shown, Chou and Fasman, 1978) , suggesting that the BCV polymorphic region forms an extremely complex bulbous structure. This structural characteristic may represent an important in viva function of the spike protein in coronavirus pathogenesis. Minor factors may easily direct conformational changes of the Sl polymorphic region, and facilitate the escape of BCVfrom immunological selective pressure. Fine mapping within the probable polymorphic region and analysis of neutralization resistant BCV mutants will help to better understand the antigenic structure of the BCV S glycoprotein. Such studies are presently in progress.",
