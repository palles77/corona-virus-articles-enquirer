The wide spectrum of microbial agents underlying the pathology renders the diagnosis of respiratory infections challenging. Molecular diagnostics offer an advantage to the current serological and culture-based methods in terms of sensitivity, coverage, hands-on time, and time to results. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the clinical performance of three commercial kits for respiratory viral detection. Study design: The performance of FilmArray Respiratory Panel, AnyplexII RV16, and Argene was compared using clinical respiratory samples (n = 224, comprising 189 nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) and 35 endotracheal aspirates), based on common overlapping targets across the platforms. Influenza A \"equivocal\" and \"no-subtype\" samples by FilmArray were further compared to a laboratory-developed Influenza A/B test.",

Lower respiratory tract samples had comparable final-run success-rates and discordant-rates as compared to UTM. Coronavirus HKU1, which was not targeted by AnyplexII RV16, were detected as OC43. The expected test volume would be the main determinant for the selection of platform.

This was accomplished by comparing the results obtained using FA-RP against those from the composite gold standard between the two sample types. A concordance in results between FA-RP and composite gold standard (i.e. both positive and both negative) was considered a match. Twotailed Fisher's Exact Test was used to assess for any significant difference in the correct diagnosis using FA-RP method (with composite gold standard as reference) between the two sample types. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Similarly, most of the respiratory aspirates were ETT, while sputum and BAL were poorly represented or not represented at all. There were only one each of PIV4, Coronavirus 229E, and 3-targets positive samples. Hence, these categories were not well represented. Another shortcoming was the use of \"positive by at least two platforms\" as the reference result for calculating sensitivity and specificity. Hence, an assay with greater sensitivity than all other assays tested would result in reduced specificity. Finally, all the platforms compared herein were multiplexed assays. The Argene duplex-assays were the closest to conventional qPCR assays.

AnyplexII and Argene are thus of higher throughput and geared towards batched testing, while the low complexity Filmarray is more suited for on-demand analysis and requires minimum hands-on time. Since the Fil-mArray performed comparably to AnyplexII, the laboratory's required turnover and workflow considerations would be major determinants in the selection of a platform for screening respiratory agents.

The Biofire system is, regarding its workflow, clearly suitable for emergency or point of care testing with an excellent time to result. The seegene AnyplexII (or the alternative Allplex in one-step RT-PCR) fits well with routine activity involving batched samples for testing on a daily basis. The Argene solution offers quite similar features with the added advantage that the test panel may be adapted with a focus on particular organisms such as Influenzae or RSV during the epidemic period depending on the ongoing epidemiology of respiratory infections.",
