Extensive studies suggest that the UPR can also be activated during virus infection. In the present studies, we first evaluated if porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection activated the UPR pathways. Electron microscopy analysis demonstrated the morphology changes of ER post-PEDV infection. Western blot and real-time PCR identified the differences of UPR genes in response to PEDV infection. The results suggested that PEDV infection induced UPR in Vero cells. Meanwhile, we silenced the expression of PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) by shRNA, we found that the knockdown of PERK increased virus loads in the cells, which was consistent with the result on 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) treatment. We next determined whether 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), an ER stress inducer, possessed antiviral activity against PEDV infection. Plaque formation assay, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis suggested that 2-DG might inhibit virus infection by affecting viral protein translation during the early stage of virus infection. Interestingly, we also found that 2-DG treatment could affect virus assembly, which is similar to previous studies on influenza virus. All these results support the therapeutic potential of using 2-DG or glucose/mannose analogs to induce the UPR to block virus replication.",

            "text": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular stress response induced by the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in order to initiates a number of cellular responses to restore ER homeostasis. The primary function of UPR is for stress adaptation and cell survival. The UPR can also be induced through glycosylation inhibitors treatment (e.g., tunicamycin), calcium homeostasis changes, nutrient depletion, overexpression of abnormal proteins, or virus infection (Dorner et al., 1989) . UPR is represented by a marked increase of ER-localized proteins such as glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78/BiP) or 94 (GRP94). UPR is controlled by three main signaling pathways, including inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK). In non-stressed cells, GRP78 binds to PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 to keep them in an inactive form (Bertolotti et al., 2000) . IRE1 is an ER transmembrane protein that contains endoribonuclease and cytoplasmic protein kinase domains. ER stress can induce the activation of IRE1. Activated IRE1 removes 26 nucleotides from the mRNA of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) to generate a spliced mRNA encoding the functional XBP-1(s) protein (Yoshida et al., 2003) . PERK, an ER resident serine/threonine protein kinase, can phosphorylate the -subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2a). During UPR, the release of GRP78 from PERK results in the homodimerization of PERK, causing phosphorylation of eIF2a to impair protein translation (Fernandez et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2009) . ATF6 normally anchors in the ER membrane. GRP78 release exposes a Golgi localization signal on ATF6. After translocation to the Golgi, ATF6 precursor (p75ATF6) is further processed into its active form (p50ATF6), which enters the nucleus to activate the transcription of UPR target genes (Ye et al., 2000) .",

For example, studies on hepatitis C virus (HCV) show that HCV infection induces the UPR, which can activate the autophagic pathway to promote HCV RNA replication in human hepatoma cells (Ke and Chen, 2011) . Some viruses regulate the UPR to initiate an environment more favorable for their replication (Buchkovich et al., 2009 (Buchkovich et al., , 2008 . African swine fever virus (ASFV) uses the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a site of replication. ASFV infection triggers ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the host cells by inducing ATF6 signaling pathway of the UPR, but not PERK or IRE1 pathway. UPR regulation by ASFV might prevent early apoptosis to facilitate viral replication (Galindo et al., 2012) . Tick-borne encephalitis virus infection activates the IRE1 and ATF6 signal pathways (Yu et al., 2013) . A study on severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) identified one of accessory proteins of SARS-CoV (8ab protein) binds directly to the luminal domain of ATF6, suggesting 8ab protein might facilitate protein folding and processing by modulating UPR (Sung et al., 2009) . This finding suggests that some viruses might use their own protein(s) to regulate UPR response.",

Because of its mannose-like structure, 2-DG can compete with mannose in the growing oligosaccharide chain during the initial steps of N-linked glycosylation occurring in the ER (Kurtoglu et al., 2007b) . Oligosaccharide chains incorporated with 2-DG cannot form the functional glucose 3 mannose 9 moiety for proper protein glycosylation. Abnormal N-linked glycosylation interferes with protein folding and induces ER stress to activate UPR, which results in the inhibition of protein synthesis. It has been reported that 2-DG can inhibit the replication and gene expression of Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (Leung et al., 2012) . 2-DG also inhibits influenza virus infection (Nakamura and Compans, 1978) . Thus, we proposed that UPR induced by 2-DG would counter the ability of PEDV to circumvent UPR-mediated blockage of protein synthesis, thereby impairing PEDV gene expression and resulting in inhibition of viral replication.",

Western blot analysis on PEDV N protein showed virus replication was increased in PERK knockdown cells, and the viral titer in supernatant was also increased (Fig. 5B) . To further confirm this finding, we evaluated the RNA level of PEDV ORF3 gene in the infected cells by Q-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5C , the RNA level of PEDV ORF3 gene 4-Phenyl butyric acid (PBA) is reported to be able to reduce ER stress (Ozcan et al., 2008; \u00d6zcan et al., 2006) . We next used 4-PBA to determine whether it could affect PEDV replication. As shown in Fig. 5D , 4-PBA decreased the phosphorylation of eIF2a in PEDV infected cells, suggesting 4-PBA alleviated ER stress induced by PEDV infection. Since 4-PBA treatment could decrease the phosphorylation of eIF2a, Vero cells were treated with different concentrations of 4-PBA at 2 h after virus infection. The result showed that virus replication increased after 4-PBA treatment as assayed by Western blot analysis of PEDV N protein (Fig. 5E ). Collectively, these data revealed that impairment of UPR either by silencing PERK or 4-PBA treatment attenuated eIF2a phosphorylation and improved the capacity of PEDV replication.",

It has been reported that activation of UPR by 2-DG elicits an early antiviral response via eIF2a inactivation, which impairs protein synthesis required to drive viral replication and oncogenesis (Ke and Chen, 2011) . Similar to KSHV (Leung et al., 2012) , PEDV also attenuated eIF2a phosphorylation at early time points. It has been shown that 2-DG increased the phosphorylation of eIF2a (DeSalvo et al., 2012; Ram\u00edrez-Peinado et al., 2011) . Therefore, we suspected that the antiviral activity of 2-DG might be related to the shutdown of viral protein synthesis due to the eIF2a inactivation, as suggested in our Western blot analysis.",

Further studies show that 2-DG prevented the maturation of influenza virus glycoproteins because an unglycosylated or incompletely glycosylated hemagglutinin precursor could be detected (Klenk et al., 1972; Nakamura and Compans, 1978; Schwarz and Klenk, 1974) . A study on murine mammary tumor virus shows that 2-DG can completely inhibit the synthesis of viral envelope precursor polyproteins Pr70env, which will be cleaved into two molecules to give rise to mature glycoproteins gp52 and gp36. Meanwhile, pr73 gag was only inhibited by 10-15% by 2-DG (Sarkar, 1986) . The native M protein has been shown to be incorporated into PEDV virions in its N-glycosylated form (Utiger et al., 1995) . The predicted polypeptide of PEDV spike protein contained 29 potential N-linked glycosylation sites with similar structural features to those of the coronavirus spike protein (Duarte and Laude, 1994) . Our data presented here showed that the virus assembly in the infected cells could be affected by 2-DG treatment. We suspected that 2-DG treatment might affect the synthesis, folding or glycosylation of viral proteins which subsequently impaired the correct assembly of the virions.",

At the low and clinically achievable doses used here, 2-DG activation of the UPR has significant anti-PEDV activity, which expanded its potential clinical application as a novel anti-PEDV approach. This study supports the therapeutic potential of using glucose/mannose analogs to induce the UPR and block viral replication. For RT-PCR analysis, the cells were treated with 10 mM 2-DG before virus infection. Bars represent mean percent copy number of viral RNA levels in cells by RT-PCR using primers specific for PEDV N gene. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using antibody against PEDV N. (D) The Vero cells were infected with PEDV for 2 h (MOI = 1), 2-DG (10 mM) was incubated with the cells. The cells were harvested at different time points. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using antibody against PEDV N.
