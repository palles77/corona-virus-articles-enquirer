            "text": "Objectives: A randomised controlled trial was performed to compare the symptomatic effects on patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treated by two therapeutic approachesthe Western medicine (WM) and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Methods: Four primary outcome measures, namely the quality of life (QOL), maximum urine flow ratio (UFR), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and prostate volumes, as well as four urethra-related and 35 non-urethra-related symptoms, were investigated to evaluate the effects on 31 BPH patients subjected to WM (Terazosin Hydrochloride Hytrin, THH) and 30 cases to TCM (herbal Saxifrage tablet, HST). The effects of both treatments are compared by the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The contributions of symptoms for four assessments are analysed by the logistic regression model and the Chow test. Results: The effect of TCM is weaker than that of WM in the assessment of the IPSS score (p < 0.05), and both treatments are similar in the prostate volumes, the maximum UFR and the QOL assessments (p > 0.05), as well as in the effective number of urethra-related or non-urethrarelated symptoms before and after treatment (p > 0.05). By comparing the linear regression models, different urethra-related and non-urethra-related symptom patterns associated with TCM and WM therapies are detected for four assessments, especially for the prostate volume assessment (p < 0.01). Conclusion: TCM (HST) is a potentially effective treatment in improving the QOL, prostate volumes and maximum UFR for patients with BPH, though it is less effective in ameliorating the IPSS score when compared with WM (THH). The non-urethra-related symptoms experienced by BPH patients might be one of the parameters to further achieve the tailored diagnosis and treatment for BPH.",

It has been recognised for a long time that the symptomatology of BPH is a complex issue, and the clearcut indications for its therapeutic intervention are still few. 3 BPH is associated with different pathogeneses, clinical features and prognoses. It remains difficult to define it clinically or measure objectively 4 , which causes trouble not only with regard to the treatment, but also with regard to the evaluation for therapeutic effects on patients with BPH.",

It is known that herbal medicines may also provide an attractive alternation to the conventional medicine for treating BPH. 6, 7 BPH is usually attributed to the TCM category of 'Long-Bi', which encompasses difficulty in urination, pain and fullness in the lower abdomen and obstructed urination. More importantly, TCM treatment is characterised by not only the investigation of complex symptoms of disease, but also the differentiation of ZHENG (TCM Syndrome), a key concept in TCM with certain symptom patterns as its manifestations and biological network disturbances as its possible underlying mechanism. 8 From the view of TCM, 'Long-Bi' represents the main illness of dysuria resulting from the different ZHENG-related symptom patterns, such as the pathologic dampness-heat and/or the deficiency of Vital Qi. 9, 10 Many Chinese herbal medicines based on the rich experiences of ZHENG differentiation are also found to be effective in treating patients with BPH. [5] [6] [7] Therefore, understanding empirical symptom patterns of 'Long-Bi' in TCM may benefit current therapeutic strategies for the management of BPH patients.",

The methodological progress in the field of evidence-based medicine (EBM) 11 may provide a means to reveal the symptom patterns, as well as the correlations between urethra-related and non-urethrarelated changes in patients with BPH. The patient report outcome (PRO), which includes the functional or symptomatic index and QOL 12 index, has gained more and more appreciation along with the transformation of current medical paradigm. 13 Many questionnaires such as the Nottingham health profile, 14, 15 the general health questionnaire 16 and the sickness impact profile 17 have been brought forward and used widely in clinical trials. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), originally known as the American Urological Association (AUA) Score, is the most commonly used scoring system for the quantification of BPH symptoms. 15 However, in clinical studies, it is still a persistent point as regards whether an evaluative system can entirely reflect the therapeutic effects or not, and then to guide the establishment of therapeutic schemes and the application of treatments. TCM devotes its attention to the self-reported symptoms of patients and the diagnostic methods of tongue and pulse, which is different from Western medicine (WM) that emphasizes on impersonal information such as laboratory data. Moreover, according to TCM observations, we found that clinical symptom patterns might provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis and diagnosis for the Helicobacter pylori infection in chronic gastritis 18 and the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes. 19 Thus, TCM may be a new avenue for further understanding the complex symptoms experienced by patients with BPH.",

The non-urethra-related symptoms contained the following 35 symptoms: depressed or irritability, dizziness and tinnitus, dry throat and polydipsia, dry throat and restlessness, thirst but do not desire drink, bitter taste, loss of appetite, fatigue and weak, heat sensation on the palm and sole, aversion to cold and cold limbs, distention in the lower abdomen and difficulty in defecation, distention or urgent pain in the lower abdomen, distention and pain in the lower abdomen, bearing-down sensation and pain in the lower abdomen, distending fullness in the hypochondrium and abdomen, cold-pain in the lumbar region and knees, soreness and weakness of the lumbar region and knees, timid and weak mind, hectically flushed cheeks, pale complexion, pale tongue with thin fur, naked red tongue, yellowish and greasy fur, red tongue with thin and white fur, red tongue with thin and yellow fur, dark purple tongue, sunk and thready pulse, sliding and rapid pulse, hesitant pulse, rapid pulse, faint pulse, thready and rapid pulse, stringy pulse, rapid breathing, and shortness of breath and low voice.",

Herbal Saxifrage, a commonly used herbal medicine for the treatment of BPH, mainly consists of bergenin, quercetinic acid 3, quercitrin, acid pyrogallol and succinate, and is reported to possess an efficacy of anti-inflammation and detoxification. 22 Moreover, bergenin and its derivatives have moderate antioxidant activities 23 and hepatoprotective effects. 24 In WM, THH acts as an adrenoceptor retardant and is a generally acknowledged effective drug, which can remit the prostatic obstruction of BPH patients, 20, 25 whereas side effects of THH are detected and include postural hypotension, confused state of mind, tachycardia and circulatory disorders. In our study, there are no significant differences in QOL and the maximum UFR between both TCM (HST) and WM (THH) treatment groups (Table 1) , which indicate that herbal Saxifrage may serve as a potentially efficient medicine for BPH and may contribute to the therapy of BPH. In the meantime, by the IPSS assessment (p < 0.05), the effect of HST was weaker than that of THH. Interestingly, by introducing the comprehensive TCM symptomatic observations, we found that the symptom patterns are helpful for interpreting the curative effects of QOL, the maximum UFR, IPSS and prostate volume assessments from the linear regression analysis (Table 3) . Moreover, we employed the Chow test for roughly evaluating the two linear regression models about TCM and CM. Analysis showed that there are significant differences in the contributions of non-urethra-related symptoms for the prostate volume assessment between TCM and WM therapies ( Table 3) , suggesting that the different non-urethra-related symptom patterns might have a certain relation to the assessment of treatment, for example, prostate volumes of BPH. In this sense, symptom patterns could be worthy of further understanding the complex manifestations of BPH. As we have known, the treatments of BPH in TCM are based on the rule of differentiation of ZHENG. 9,10 Therefore, the effects of TCM and WM, which are associated with different symptom patterns, might indicate different strategies for the treatment of patients with BPH.",

Finally, the principal symptoms that draw attention to a significant urethra problem from BPH may be due to the secondary phenomena such as chronic or recurrent bacterial urethra infection or to symptoms resulting from impaired kidney function. 26 The stimulus to seek an evaluation of voiding dysfunction possibly caused by BPH has traditionally been the presence of lower urethra symptoms. The results indicate that BPH may have the same pathologic change with diverse clinical manifestations and the integrity dysfunction could not be reflected entirely by the objective measurements alone.
