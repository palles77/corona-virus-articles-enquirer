To understand better the effects of prolonged storage, this investigation evaluated the filtration efficiency of 21 different models of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified disposable N95 filtering face piece respirators. These respirators had been stored in their original packaging for a period of at least 6 years in research laboratories and dry warehouse facilities, ranging in temperature between 158C and 328C and relative humidity between 20% and 80%. Methods: Filter penetration was measured using an abbreviated version of the NIOSH respirator certification test incorporating a polydisperse sodium chloride aerosol at 85 L/min. Results: Of the 21 respirator models tested, 19 models had both average penetration results of less than 5%. Mean initial penetration values ranged from 0.39% to 5.83%, whereas mean maximum penetration values ranged from 0.95% to 5.83%. There did not appear to be any correlation between the length of storage and failure to pass the filtration test. Conclusion: Results indicate that most N95 filtering face piece respirators stored for up to 10 years at warehouse conditions will likely have expected levels of filtration performance and that the degree of filtration efficiency degradation is likely model specific.",

            "text": "Growing concern over a possible shortage of disposable N95 filtering face piece respirators (N95FFRs) in the event of widespread outbreak of airborne transmitted infectious disease has drawn the attention of health care workers (HCW) and local, state, and federal public health officials. Current guidance for treating patients with an infectious disease involves frequently discarding N95FFRs, resulting in rapid depletion of existing supplies. To address this concern, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct an analysis of the potential reuse of disposable N95FFR and N95 respirator/surgical masks. During this analysis, the IOM found that the demand for N95 respirators by the health care sector alone could be over 90 million for a 42-day influenza pandemic outbreak. 1 This analysis was consistent with the observation at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, Canada, where 18,000 N95FFRs were used daily during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. 2 Current respirator manufacturing techniques and practices make it difficult to increase production to meet unexpected demand. In the case of a global event, it may be difficult to transport resources to the location with the greatest need. Thus, there is an overarching need for solutions to a probable shortage of N95FFRs.",

            "text": "Two potential solutions have been identified to possibly abate this demand: (1) reuse (via FFR decontamination or surgical mask overlay) and (2) stockpiling. There are advantages and disadvantages to both choices; however, stockpiling is preferred by many because of the uncertainty associated with potential reuse of an N95FFR. The government of France began stockpiling 685 million N95FFRs for its HCWs. 3 The US Strategic National Stockpile currently includes 100 million N95FFRs for distribution mainly to HCWs in the event of a national emergency. 4 One concern with stockpiling N95FFRs is whether prolonged storage affects filtration performance. The National Institute for Occupation Safety and Health (NIOSH) requires filter testing as part of the respirator certification process. Most N95FFRs sold commercially in the last decade use electret filter media. Electret or electrostatic filter media are produced by imparting a static electric charge on split polypropylene fibers to enhance their capture efficiency via coulombic attraction and polarizing forces. 5 Electret filter media are designed to improve the filter collection efficiency of submicrometer particles, without an increase in breathing resistance (pressure drop). Respirators utilizing electret filter media can generally be made lighter in weight and more compact than those composed of purely mechanical filter media. 6 A drawback to electret filter media is that, if the electrostatic charge is lost or removed, filtration efficiency for submicrometer particles degrades significantly. However, significantly degraded electret media can still achieve excellent filtration performance when tested against common workplace aerosols, which are nearly always larger than the aerosol size range used in the NIOSH certification test. 7 Certain chemical and physical processes are known to degrade the laboratory filtration performance of N95FFRs employing electret filter media. The degradation of electret filter media using organic solvents has been widely reported in the literature. [8] [9] [10] [11] In general, studies have shown that organic solvents (eg, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol) when applied in liquid form cause significant change to the laboratory filtration performance of respirators containing electret filter media. 12, 13 Likewise, physical processes including gamma radiation, 14 heat, 11 and x-ray radiation 14, 15 are known to degrade electret filter media. However, other chemical and physical processes such as simulated decontamination using tap water, ultraviolet radiation, or hydrogen peroxide (vaporized and liquid forms) caused no statistically significant change to electret filter performance. 11 Moreover, other studies have found that dipping N95FFRs in water for 15 seconds had only a minimal effect on filtration performance. 12 Although Ackley 16 has characterized the degradation of electrostatic media at elevated temperatures (up to 658C) and humidity (up to 90% relative humidity), the effects of these extreme conditions have only been studied for relatively short durations of time.",

Currently, there is no stated shelf life or use-before-date for NIOSH-approved FFRs provided they are stored undamaged in their original packaging at normal room temperature (158C to 278C). Manufacturers may provide users with specific shelf-life guidance on their products, and some manufacturers offer expiration dates, which are also based on time testing. One manufacturer provided information to its customers that they currently test respirator performance after storage for up to 3 years (Letter from 3M Occupational Health and Safety Division, 2006). They further added, ''Internal testing results show respirators stored in their original packaging (as if for sale) at normal room temperature (158C to 278C) still meet NIOSH 42 CFR 84 performance specifications after 3 years of storage.'' Because stockpiling is a recent phenomenon (most workplaces use just-in-time inventory and keep only as many as they need on hand), the effect of prolonged storage on filtration performance of N95FFRs has not raised much attention. The goal of this article is to report the filtration performance of commercially available N95FFRs stored for 6 to 10 years to determine whether there was a significant change in their filtration characteristics as well as to discuss the implications of these results for N95FFR stockpile administrators. This information will also be useful for policy makers in public health, infection control, and pandemic planning until a more formal aging study can be completed.",

Prior to filtration efficiency testing, all N95FFR samples were environmentally preconditioned in accordance with the requirements of the NIOSH 42 CFR 84 particulate respirator certification protocol; samples were taken out of their original packaging and placed in a preconditioning chamber at 85% 6 5% relative humidity and 388C 6 2.58C for 25 6 1 hours. 21, 23 Polydisperse NaCl aerosol loading tests were performed with the TSI 8130 AFT until it was determined that a maximum penetration value was obtained. This test typically takes approximately 90 to 100 minutes to load 200 mg of NaCl aerosol onto the respirator. The initial penetration value (which is measured at approximately the first minute of the loading test), the maximum penetration value, and the filter resistance of the N95FFR were recorded. Three replicate N95FFR samples from each of the 21 models were tested by this procedure. Data collection was conducted June 2007 through December 2007. The filter test methods used in this study differ slightly from the methods used in NIOSH certification and audit testing. Three samples per model were tested instead of 20, as is required by 42 CFR 84.181. 21 In addition, the reported resistance values were obtained from the TSI 8130 AFT. These values should not be considered identical to inhalation resistance values obtained during NIOSH certification testing because those inhalation measurements are performed on separate calibrated test equipment. 21 ",

No data are available on the initial or maximum penetration for these products at the time they were purchased. Because all were NIOSH-certified respirators, the authors assumed that all of the products passed NIOSH performance criteria when they were purchased. This was a sample of ''convenience''; as such, the authors decided to take advantage of the fact that these stored respirators may offer some useful information to stockpile administrators about the potential longevity of N95FFRs until there is an opportunity to conduct a more formal aging investigation. Thus, it was not possible to do a true ''before-and-after'' analysis (eg, using a paired t test) to ascertain any statistically significant changes in filtration efficiency.

It must be noted that 42 CFR 84 requires all changes and modifications to respirators be examined by NIOSH to determine whether testing is required (42 CFR 84.35).
