The QIAamp MinElute Virus kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) was compared to the two existing methods currently used in our laboratory, IsoQuick (Orca Research Inc., Bothell, WA) for DNA extraction and RNAzol B (Leedo Laboratories Inc., Houston, TX) for RNA extraction, of viral nucleic acids. Study design: A total of 150 clinical specimens, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), were used to determine the extraction efficiency of the MinElute compared to the other two methods. Nucleic acid recovery, hands-on time, turn-around-time and cost were compared across all kits. Results: There was complete concordance between the MinElute and IsoQuick/RNAzol kits when herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), influenza A virus or enteroviruses were detected using a colorimetric microtiter plate PCR system. The kits were equivalent in their ability to detect either DNA or RNA with superior ability to recover a high quality and quantity of RNA. With the potential to process larger specimen volumes, the MinElute kit can significantly shorten processing time from 2 h to 50-55 min. Conclusions: Although relatively high test kit costs were noted, the MinElute kit provides another rapid and user-friendly specimen processing tool in the diagnostic molecular microbiology laboratory.",

One example is in the diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis versus enteroviral meningitis. Central nervous system (CNS) infections caused by the two viruses can be difficult to distinguish clinically. Early treatment of HSV encephalitis can reduce patient morbidity and mortality (Skoldenberg et al., 1984; Whitley et al., 1986) while early diagnosis of CNS disease due to enterovirus can significantly shorten hospital stay and avoid overuse of broad range antibiotics (Ramers et al., 2000; Rotbart et al., 1994) . On the other hand, early recognition of viral respiratory diseases caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses is critical for isolating patients to prevent nosocomial transmission (Rovida et al., 2005) . Chemotherapy is more effective when the antiviral drugs are given at the earliest stage of diseases (Hayden et al., 1997; Treanor et al., 2000) . For several viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and 1386-6532/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Molecular tests are now available that can be performed as an alternative to or in addition to these rapid tests, providing both a rapid and sensitive method to detect respiratory viruses. When using molecular techniques for virus detection, it is important to find a method for extracting nucleic acid from clinical samples that will concentrate the sample, provide a maximum yield of nucleic acids and also remove inhibitory substances. Improvements in nucleic acid extraction methodology have resulted in better target nucleic acid recovery and amplification inhibitor removal (Espy et al., 2001; Read, 2001) . The more a target organism is present in a sample, the more chance there is of detecting the organism using PCR. If a larger specimen volume is processed, then more nucleic acid can be isolated. A nucleic acid extraction system that can handle diversified clinical specimens with different volumes is desirable.",

Both kits work well in concentrating and isolating nucleic acids while removing inhibitors; however, they are time-consuming procedures, and cannot be adapted to process larger volumes of sample. Recently, a QIAamp MinElute kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) became available, which can be used for simultaneous purification of viral RNA and DNA from a variety of specimen types without organic extraction or alcohol precipitation. A specimen can be processed by using either a vacuum or a spin procedure. With an additional adaptor, the MinElute system can process specimens with large and variable volumes. In this study, we have chosen both nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens submitted for influenza A virus, enterovirus and herpesvirus testing to validate the MinElute nucleic acid extraction system. The quantity and quality of the extracted nucleic acids and the sensitivity and reproducibility for relevant pathogen detection were compared to the currently used IsoQuick/RNAzol B methods. In addition, total extraction time and technologist hands-on time as well as costs for performing the system were determined.",

For the MinElute protocol, viral RNA was extracted by the MinElute Vacuum kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 100 l CSF or 1.1 ml NPS-lysis buffer mixture was mixed with 75 l of protease, and then 550 l of a Buffer AL/Carrier RNA mixture was added. After incubating at 56 \u2022 C for 15 min, 600 l of ethanol was added and the mixture was incubated for five more minutes. The entire volume of sample was then added to a spin column connected to a vacuum manifold. The sample was then drawn through the column to allow the nucleic acids to bind to the silica membrane. A series of washes were performed and viral RNA was eluted into 55 l of sample diluent (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ) by centrifuging for 1 min at 12,000 \u00d7 g.",

Nucleic acids bind specifically to the silica-gel membrane while contaminants pass through (Boom et al., 1990) . No organic extraction or alcohol precipitation was involved in the processing, which is superior to phenol/chloroform-based chaotropic lysis included in the IsoQuick and RNAzol B kits (Smalling et al., 2002; Tang et al., 1998 Tang et al., , 1999 . Several components in the organic phase (e.g., phenol) are strong amplification inhibitors. During specimen processing, if residual organic phase was carried over, the phenol would bind and inactivate the DNA polymerase and cause false negative results (Katcher and Schwartz, 1994) . To avoid residual phenol carryover, we have implemented an additional spin step to make sure all organic solvents are removed. This, in turn, compromises DNA recovery due to loss of some of the aqueous phase and increases the time needed for specimen processing.",

Although relatively high test kit costs were noted, the MinElute kit provides another rapid and user-friendly specimen processing tool in the diagnostic molecular microbiology laboratory.",
