To relieve this burden, we are in search of an inexpensive material that can adsorb pathogens from drinking water. In this pursuit, we have studied the natural carbohydrate, chitosan. To impart virus removal features, chitosan has been functionalized with a quaternary amine to form quaternized chitosan N-[(2-hydroxyl-3-trimethylammonium) propyl] chitosan (HTCC). HTCC can be electrospun into nanofibers with the non-ionogenic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), creating a high surface area mat. High surface area is a major requirement for effective adsorption processes. HTCC is antiviral and antimicrobial, making it a good material for water purification. However, HTCC dissolves in water. We have explored the parameters to crosslink the nanofibers with glutaraldehyde. We have imparted water stability so there is a maximum of 30% swelling of the fibers after 6 h in water. The water stable fibers retain their ability to adsorb virus, as shown for an enveloped and nonenveloped virus. HTCC now has the potential to be incorporated into a microfiltration membrane that can remove viruses. This could create an inexpensive, low pressure filtration membrane for drinking water purification.",

            "text": "In our search for an inexpensive material that has the potential to adsorb pathogens, we have selected chitosan. Chitosan (chemical structure shown in Figure 1 ) is a polycationic polymer and the N-deacetylated derivative of the natural polymer chitin, the second most abundant polysaccharide found on earth next to cellulose. 6, 7 Chitosan is insoluble in water and common organic solvents because of its rigid crystalline structure. It is soluble in acidic, aqueous solution if the pH value is less than 6.5. 8 Chitosan is well known to be non-toxic, biocompatible, biodegradable, biofunctional, and hydrophilic. [9] [10] [11] [12] Chitosan has been used as an antimicrobial and antiviral material in the fields of biotechnology, pharmaceutics, wastewater treatment, cosmetics, agriculture, food science, and textiles because of its advantageous biological properties. [12] [13] [14] However, this activity of chitosan against pathogens is limited to acidic conditions due to its poor solubility above pH value of 6.5, where chitosan starts to lose its polycationic nature. 7, 12 The polycationic nature is what imparts most of chitosan's antimicrobial and antiviral properties. Therefore, the preparation of chitosan derivatives with an improved cationic properties over a wide pH range was studied for their antimicrobial and antiviral activity. 6, 7, 10 Among the various chitosan derivatives, the derivatives with quaternary ammonium groups have shown higher efficient activity against bacteria as compared to those of chitosan. 6,10,12 Quaternized chitosan N-[(2-hydroxyl-3-trimethylammonium) propyl] chitosan (HTCC) 7, 11, 14 (chemical structure shown in Figure 1 ), N-N-propyl-N, N-dimethyl chitosan 15 and N-butyl-N,N-dimethyl chitosan iodide 6,10 showed enhanced antimicrobial activity compared with chitosan. 14, 16 This may be due to the positively-charged quaternary amine group, known to target the negatively charged cytoplasmic membrane of microbes, altering membrane properties and impeding nutrients entering the cells. 12 hydrophobically-modified HTCC compounds were shown to inhibit the human coronavirus NL63 and murine hepatitis virus. 17 Doublestranded RNA formulated with quaternized chitosan derivative was shown to inhibit yellow head virus. 18 HTCC blended with graphene can also reduce infectious porcine parvovirus (PPV) concentrations in high salt environments. 19 To form HTCC fibers, we use the technique of electrospinning. 19, 20 This method creates fibers that have a submicron diameter. An electric potential is applied to a polymer solution. When the electric potential overcomes the viscosity and surface tension, a jet is created from the polymer solution. The jet whips as the solvent dries, prior to the resting of polymer nanofibers on the collector. The use of a rotating drum collector helps to create more even surface coverage for filtration media. The high surface to volume ratio of nanofibers is sought to increase the adsorptive capacity and accessible surface area of the membrane.",

Crosslinking of polymer structures is a common method to impart membrane stability in water soluble polymers. 21 PVA fibers were crosslinked with maleic anhydride to create a filtration membrane. 22 HTCC blended with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was photo-crosslinked to impart antimicrobial resistance to the fibers. 10 Glutaraldehyde vapor was used to crosslink HTCC-PVA fibers to create an antimicrobial surface. 7 Here, we demonstrate that HTCC nanofibers can be crosslinked while retaining their nonwoven structure and their ability to bind to negatively-charged viruses. We have explored the crosslinking conditions that give the greatest water stability. These conditions allowed for high virus removal. Our model viruses include the non-enveloped porcine parvovirus (PPV), one of the smallest known mammalian viruses and the enveloped virus, Sindbis virus. This nanofiber material has the potential to become an inexpensive defense against water-borne diseases.",

This has been explored in a wide range of values, 7 and we chose a more narrow range. In Table 1 , it shows that the conductivity and absolute viscosity increase with an increase in HTCC content. Fiber diameter decreases with increasing HTCC content. Our results are consistent for conductivity and fiber diameter to those of Alipour et al. 7 however, our increase in viscosity is not consistent with the reported decrease in viscosity. 7 This may be due to the different molecular weights of chitosan and PVA used in each work. From SEM images, shown in Figure S2 , the density of fibers formed from a 10 w/v% polymer blend greatly decreased once the HTCC content reached 50% of the total polymer content. This is consistent with other's findings for 12 w/v% HTCC-PVA solutions. 7 We desired the highest amount of HTCC as could be electrospun for water purification applications. For this reason, we chose to continue our studies with 4:6 HTCC-PVA blends.",

For the uncrosslinked membrane, both the polymer of HTCC and PVA swells and the distance between any two polymer chains increases as the adsorbed water molecules increase. 24 Once the attractive forces between these two polymers chains are not sufficient to keep them within a critical distance, the polymer dissolves. 24 To stabilize the fibers, glutaraldehyde vapor was used to crosslink the fibers. This gave the fibers stability in water since the aldehyde group of glutaraldehyde will react with the unbound hydroxyl groups of both the HTCC and PVA to form crystallizations zones. 25 Water caused fiber swelling to different degrees for all crosslinking conditions. Even the glutaraldehyde vapor caused some swelling of the fibers, since it was in an aqueous solution. As shown in Figure 2 , nanofibers with a crosslinking time of 4 h in 30% glutaraldehyde had the least swelling and were the most water stable. This can also be confirmed in Figure 3 , which graphically shows the diameter of the fibers. The diameter of 30% glutaraldehyde, 4 h crosslinked nanofibers (dry, filtered and immersed for 10 min in water) were the closest to the diameter of fresh electrospun nanofibers. There was a statistically significant swelling of all crosslinked samples, as compared to the dry control without crosslinking. Both 10% glutaraldehyde, 4 h and 30% glutaraldehyde, 2 h crosslinked fibers started dissolving when contacted with water for 10 min and some coalescence of fibers was observed as shown in Figure 2 . From Figures 2 and 3 , it could be noted that the fiber stability increased with the increase of crosslinker concentration and crosslinking time, as demonstrated by a lack of fiber diameter increase.",

The average nanofiber diameter significantly decreased with an increase in the applied voltage, which is similar to the data found previously. 7,10 This is likely due to an increased charge density on the polymer solution as the voltage increases. The greater Coulombic repulsive forces cause the polymer jet to accelerate faster and to have an increased stretch. 26 In addition, the average diameter of nanofibers increased with an increase in the feed rate. This is likely due to insufficient time available for the electrospinning solution to evaporate, resulting in fusing of the fibers together at the higher feed rate. 27 This can be seen in Figure 6 . This demonstrates that we can control the fiber diameter. In the future, we will explore how fiber diameter effects virus removal.",

The fibers were tested for their ability to remove two different viruses, porcine parvovirus (PPV) and Sindbis virus. PPV is a nonenveloped virus and Sindbis is an enveloped virus. These viruses represent two distinct classes of viruses that could contaminate water. A range of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses are typically used to evaluate generic virus removal techniques. 28 The water-stable nanofibers achieved a 3.3 LRV for PPV and a 4.2 LRV for Sindbis. No virus was removed when only blank filter paper with no crosslinking was contacted with the virus. Crosslinking of blank filter paper (the control) did remove some virus. This demonstrates that the glutaraldehyde, even after water washing, has some virus adsorption properties. Nevertheless, the addition of nanofibers greatly increased the virus removal as compared to glutaraldehyde exposed filter paper (the control). The maximum theoretical removal was 4.4 LRV. These values come close to or exceed the EPA regulation of a 4 LRV for virus removal processes. 29 This is a clear demonstration that these stable nanofibers have the ability to bind to two different viruses and could become a new material for virus removal in drinking water applications.",

We pursued this polymer for the creation of electrospun membranes that remove pathogens from drinking water. To realize this goal, we have examined the crosslinking of glutaraldehyde vapor to impart water stability to HTCC-PVA nanofibers. It was found that using high glutaraldehyde concentration and crosslinking time created a membrane that was stable for a minimum of 6 h in water with a maximum swelling degree of 30%. The water-stable nanofibers had a high virus removal, with an LRV of 3.3 and 4.2 for a non-enveloped and an enveloped virus, respectively. This is approaching or exceeding the EPA regulation of 4 LRV. 29 With careful design of a filtration apparatus, along with other polymer modifications, this system has high potential to become a future pathogen removal system for water purification.",

The clear solution was concentrated under vacuum with a Buchi R-200 rotavapor (New Castle, DE) at 70\u00b0C.
