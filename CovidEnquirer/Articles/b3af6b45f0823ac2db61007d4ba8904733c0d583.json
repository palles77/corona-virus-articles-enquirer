            "text": "When a new infl uenza virus that can infect and cause disease in people emerges, such as the avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus, risk assessment is an urgent public health priority. 1-3 In guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4 risk assessment metrics were broken down into ten criteria in three categories: properties of the virus, including transmission potential; properties of the population, including pre-existing immunity and the severity of human infections; and ecology and epidemiology in animals and human beings. The second category includes one of the most diffi cult criteria to assess, but the most important in terms of public health eff ects-namely, the clinical severity of human infections, which is estimated by measures such as the case fatality risk. 5 The seriousness of infections has major implications for the potential overall severity of an infl uenza pandemic. 3 However, assessment of severity is challenging because typically the most serious illnesses associated with infection have a much higher probability of being detected and laboratory confi rmed than do mild illnesses. 6 Human infections with the novel infl uenza A H7N9 virus were fi rst identifi ed in China in March, 2013, and the initial laboratory-confi rmed cases were all patients with serious illness. 7-9 The earliest laboratory-confi rmed cases were clustered around the Yangtze River delta, while subsequent laboratory-confi rmed cases occurred in neighbouring provinces to the south and north. 10, 11 Most laboratory-confi rmed cases occurred in urban areas in people who reported exposure to live poultry in the 7 days before illness onset. 11 Investigation of live poultry markets in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, identifi ed a high preva lence of infection in poultry, 12 and closure of live poultry markets seems to have been eff ective in the control of outbreaks. 12-14 Intensive follow-up of more than 2500 close contacts of laboratoryconfi rmed cases identifi ed just fi ve potential secondary A H7N9 virus infections, 11 which is consistent with low person-to-person transmissibility. Pre-existing immunity to in fl u e nza A H7N9 virus will probably be low in all age groups of the general population. 15 Although initial estimates of clinical severity focused on laboratory-confi rmed cases, 8-10 they could give an incomplete picture. 16 As the outbreak has continued, it has become clear that undetected cases of milder symptomatic infections have occurred. First, with the assumption that no immunity is present in any age group, the pattern in age-specifi c incidence of serious cases is not consistent with presumed patterns in exposure, implying that severity increases with age and that many undetected mild infections have occurred in adults. 17 Second, six of the 131 laboratory-confi rmed cases as of May 28, 2013, were identifi ed via national sentinel infl uenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance (including the most recent case, reported on May 28 in Beijing), which is a population-wide system for measurement of patterns in consultation of patients with ILI and virological testing for infl uenza virus infections in a subset of patients. 18, 19 Of the six cases (aged 2-26 years), only one developed pneumonia, and the other fi ve cases had uncomplicated illness. Because this surveillance system is based on a sampling approach, laboratory confi rmation of the six cases implies a substantial number of unconfi rmed symptomatic infections with mild to moderate illness.",

We combined these data with the daily number of all ILI cases reported and specimens tested by ILI surveillance in the two cities to infer the number of infected individuals who would have sought medical care at ILI sentinels (N ILI-S ; appendix). We then used two alternative methods to estimate the number of symptomatic infections in Shanghai and Nanjing. With method 1, we assumed that health-careseeking behaviour of individuals with ILI associated with infection with the infl uenza A H7N9 virus was the same as health-care-seeking behaviour for those with ILI associated with the 2009 infl uenza A H1N1 pandemic virus infection. We used data from a nationwide serosurvey and ILI surveillance of the 2009 infl uenza A H1N1 pandemic virus in China from June, 2009, to January, 2010, 23 to estimate the proportion of individuals with symptomatic infections who sought medical care at ILI sentinels.

After estimating the number of mild cases in Shanghai and Nanjing, we extrapolated our estimate to the rest of mainland China on the basis of the proportion of patients with H7N9 admitted to hospital in those two cities (ie, pro rata).

When possible, an ILI surveillance system that is capitated-ie, based on known population denominators 36 rather than on fl oating consultation denominators-would enable improved characterisation of rates of ILI in the population; laboratory data for a subset of patients could be used to extrapolate the proportion of illnesses associated with infl uenza. 37 However, this system would be challenging in most settings without a defi ned population catchment. Reasonable estimates of the fatality risk were available by mid-May. During the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, reports of the case fatality risk were low when based on number of deaths divided by number of cases cross-sectionally before complete resolution of all cases, leading to substantial discussion and methodological development during and after that epidemic. 20, 38, 39 10 years later, during the present H7N9 outbreak, case fatality risks of about 20-25% have frequently been communicated, 9, 10, 29, 30 which is an underestimate.

            "text": "Our analyses have some limitations. First, our estimates are real time, calculated during the ongoing outbreak of H7N9 while some patients remained critically ill in hospital. Our estimates of fatality risks have fairly wide CIs that will narrow as illnesses resolve. Second, although we could estimate age-specifi c fatality risks, we could not estimate age-specifi c symptomatic-case risks in our analyses; further work is needed in this area. Third, our estimates of the number of symptomatic cases by two methods were based on extrapolation from the sentinel ILI network, and necessitated several simplifying assumptions, such as no geographical diff erences in ascertainment of patients admitted to hospital and no changes in health-care-seeking behaviour in late March, and early April, 2013. Our analysis could be biased if there were additional undetected hospital admissions associated with avian infl uenza A H7N9-eg, because of poor access to laboratory testing in some areas-or if health-care attendance was increased in view of the perceived severity of this novel infection. Fourth, without data for the proportion of subclinical or asymptomatic infections, we cannot estimate the fatality risk for all infected individuals (ie, not just the risk for those admitted to hospital). Such information might be available from serological studies in future. 40 Finally, clinical information about some laboratory-con fi rmed cases was not available, and standardised collection and sharing of clinical data would assist risk assessment and treatment. 41 In conclusion, our estimate of a symptomatic case fatality risk suggests that avian infl uenza A H7N9 is not as severe as infl uenza A H5N1, 42 but more severe than 2009 infl uenza A H1N1 pandemic virus (panel). 51 We are not aware of comparative data for the symptomatic case fatality risks of seasonal infl uenza viruses, but we speculate that they are similar in size to the 2009 pandemic virus. As with seasonal infl uenza, the severity of avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus infection increases with age. Our fi ndings will inform risk assessment and health policy during the present H7N9 outbreak, and will assist preparations for a potential resurgence in human infections towards the end of 2013. 11 Our framework could be used for pandemic risk assessment of future avian infl uenza viruses that cause disease in people.
