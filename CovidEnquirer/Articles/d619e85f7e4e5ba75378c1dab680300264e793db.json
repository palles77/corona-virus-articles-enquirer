Over the years, it has been proposed that HCoVs play a possible role in gastrointestinal infections. Objectives: To assess the role of HCoVs in acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children. Study design: Study was conducted at Tampere University Hospital over 2 years. Both stool and nasal swab samples were collected from 172 children with AGE, 545 with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) and 238 with symptoms of both. The samples were tested for HCoVs by RT-PCR. Results: HCoVs were detected in 52 (5.4%) children: in 6.4% of those with AGE, 4.4% with ARTI and 7.1% with symptoms of both. HCoVs OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63 were encountered in 13, 11, 13 and 15 cases, respectively. HCoVs were detected simultaneously in stool and nasal swab samples in 17 children, in nasal swabs alone in 33 children, and in the stools alone in two children. HCoVs were present in the stools of eight (4.7%) of the 172 children with AGE; in six of these cases, the nasal swab sample was also positive for the respective HCoV. Additionally, in six of the eight cases, the stool sample contained either rotavirus or calicivirus. Conclusions: HCoVs can be detected in the stools of children with AGE, but usually together with wellknown gastroenteritis viruses, and concomitantly in the respiratory tract. It appears that commonly circulating HCoVs do not have a significant role in the AGE of children admitted to hospital.",

OC43 and 229E, the \"common cold viruses\", have been known since the 1960s [1] [2] [3] [4] , and they have been found in 1.9% of children hospitalized for respiratory tract infection [5] . A more recently discovered coronavirus, NL63 [6] , has been detected in 1.7-3.2% of respiratory tract samples of children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) [5, [7] [8] [9] , including acute laryngitis [5, 7, 9] . Another recently discovered human coronavirus, HKU1 [10] , was detected in 2.95% of children hospitalized for upper or lower respiratory tract infections [11] . It seems that all of these HCoVs may cause respiratory tract infections in children that are severe enough to lead to hospitalization, but none of them seems to be more pathogenic than any other [12] .",

Of children with ARTI, those admitted as inpatients were eligible. Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all children enrolled. For the analysis of the study results, the patients were divided into three groups: the AGE group (children with symptoms of gastrointestinal infection only), the ARTI group (children with symptoms of respiratory tract infection only), and the AGE/ARTI group (children with different combinations of symptoms of both AGE and ARTI).

Therefore, none of the four coronaviruses could be specifically associated with AGE. Moreover, when HCoV was found in stools, it was almost always found concomitantly in the nasal swab too. These findings could mean that the detection in stools reflects the presence of HCoV in the respiratory tract and the virus detected in stools may only be there as the result of being swallowed. In the present study, in almost all cases of HCoV detection in both stool and nasal swab samples, the nasal swab samples were positive in the first PCR step. This suggests a relatively large quantity of viruses in the respiratory tract, compared to cases with a positive nasal swab sample only; in these cases, over half of the samples were positive only in the second PCR step. This could mean that higher virus load in the respiratory tract results in the presence of the virus in the stool either due to swallowing or by other mechanism.

HCoV findings in stools are more likely to be derived from respiratory infection, and the gastroenteritis symptoms can be explained by the well-known gastroenteritis viruses found in the same stool samples.
