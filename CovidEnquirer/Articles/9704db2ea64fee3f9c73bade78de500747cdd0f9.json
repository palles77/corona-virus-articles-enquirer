Since the anthrax attacks of 2001, the nation has been preparing to respond to two forms of bioterrorism: covert and overt attacks. Covert attacks would normally be characterized as silent releases of a biological agent into a population, which later would correspond to many patients presenting to clinics and hospital emergency departments with a similar clinical syndrome. In this setting, syndromic surveillance is of paramount importance. Indeed, there may be several indicators for a covert act of bioterrorism. Table 12 .1 lists some of the indications and characteristics of an outbreak due to bioterrorism.",

The biological challenge, whether overt or covert, poses one of the most difficult set of circumstances for response organizations to tackle. Local community government officials know that they have limited ability to respond to the release of a biological agent, be it overt or covert. Frankly, it would be prohibitively expensive for all communities, especially small ones, to build the critical mass needed for them to effectively recognize the problem, respond, contain the outbreak, and treat the casualties. Most state governments have built a capacity for dealing with the biological challenge, but they lack the resources needed to contain widespread outbreaks.

Indeed, how could you prevent a terrorist or group of belligerents from using biological agents? Laws with stiff penalties for breaking them may be a deterrent to some amateur terrorist or prankster; however, to others determined to advance their agenda, laws are of no consequence. Those concerned about the proliferation of bioweapons might enact policies for limited exchange or trade of questionable substances. Governments concerned about scientific advancements or sensitive information ending up in the public domain might assemble a group to provide guidelines and oversight. Finally, developments in disease prevention and new treatments might be fostered so that the threat from certain biological agents might dissipate, especially if you could protect a nation from such a threat.",

The group's main objective has been to enhance the effectiveness of national export licensing measures for specific chemical and biological agents.

Project BioShield legislation was the result of a bipartisan effort in response to the catastrophic events of September 11, 2001, and the anthrax and ricin attacks directed against members of Congress and other Americans. The BioShield project has three primary goals. First, the project authorized funds to purchase and stockpile vaccines aimed at countering specific biothreat agents. Second, the project authorized funding for increased research and development of new pharmaceuticals for the diseases caused by specific biothreat pathogens. Third, the project proposed sweeping changes in government authorization regarding medical response to a bioterror crisis and the approval processes for new drugs and vaccines (Marek, 2007) . ",

After spending tens to hundreds of millions of dollars up front, what would be the likelihood that the product would sell in sufficient quantity to enable the company to show a profit? There is virtually no way for new drug makers to see a potential profit in any of these ventures unless they were able to predict when, where, and what agent would be used in the next act of bioterrorism, if any. The Project BioShield bill gave authority to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use unapproved drugs in national (public health) emergencies. The Project BioShield bill also authorizes federal officials to contract with private enterprises to purchase these medications while they are still under development. However, the final approval for purchase is contingent on clinical trials and tests that indicate the treatments are safe and efficacious. Project BioShield was intended to remove some of the uncertainties that companies face in producing these drugs. Perhaps one of the most important aspects of this is the preemergence of a buyer (the federal government) for a product that will take tens of millions of dollars to research and produce. In this way the speculative nature of any new venture is, to a degree, reduced.",

The government will now assist with the cost of establishing domestic manufacturing facilities. It will also provide liability coverage to those companies whose products, not yet licensed with the FDA, will be used during biological attacks. Under these new guidelines, clear evidence of intentional misconduct must be present for a company manufacturing one of these pharmaceuticals to be sued.

Project BioShield was originally focused on Category A bioterror agents smallpox, botulinum, and anthrax. However, it was quickly realized that other agents, such as radiological agents, nuclear agents, and nerve agents, should also be encompassed within Project BioShield. At the conclusion of 2011, Project BioShield had paid for the delivery of 28.75 million doses of BioThrax, which is the only FDA-approved anthrax vaccine, and 107,560 doses of an antitoxin for botulism (Scheidmiller, 2012) . Although the number of doses of the botulism antitoxin are well below the 200,000 originally ordered in 2006, the HHS decided that the 107,560 doses received were sufficient (Roos, 2012) . However, HHS has continued to receive additional deliveries of botulism antitoxins through 2013 (US DHHS, 2014). Refer to Table 12 .2 for a summary of funds spent on primary WMD concerns. One of the major success of the Project BioShield program is in the increased development of countermeasures to potential bioterror agents. The market for developing medical countermeasures is typically a high-cost, high-risk market (Russell, 2007) . This is particularly true when the major purchasers of your product are governments. \"The federal government is frequently perceived by pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturers as an uncertain and low-profit market\" (Russell, 2007) . The annual appropriations process further complicates these factors as long-term fund availability becomes questionable, at best. Project BioShield provided a long-term financial incentive to manufacturers to develop the products needed for defense against CBRN threats (Russell, 2007) . To date, 12 new products have been added to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to address anthrax, botulism, smallpox, and other CBRN threats (US DHHS, 2014) . This includes 4.8 million doses of potassium iodide and 437,710 doses of intravenous calcium/zinc diethylenetriamine pentaacetate for radionuclear threats; 920,000 ST-246 vaccines and 20,864,000 Imvamune MVA smallpox vaccines; 138,749 doses of botulinum antitoxin; 28,750,000 doses of BioThrax (anthrax vaccine absorbed); 10,000 doses of anthrax immune globulin; and 65,000 doses of monoclonal antibody (Raxibacumab, formerly Abthrax) for anthrax (US DHHS, 2014) .",

With a funding source firmly in place from the federal government, pharmaceutical companies are more likely to spend their money on the research and development of potential countermeasures. Project BioShield continues to encourage development by promising to purchase countermeasures up to 8 years before it is reasonably expected to be delivered. This allows appropriate time for the research and development of productive countermeasures and for the protracted FDA approval processes. The final goal of Project BioShield involves the allowance for an EUA from the FDA for bioterror countermeasures that are in the final stages of the approval process. This authorization would only be used in an emergency, but it also encourages the continued development of medical countermeasures. An EUA can be issued by the Secretary of HHS and expires \"when the HHS Secretary determines the underlying emergency circumstances no longer exist\" (Gottron, 2014) .

Every public health jurisdiction in the country has the responsibility to develop and maintain the capability to carry out first response and federally assisted mass drug dispensing and vaccination campaigns tailored to its local population. At least four reasons underlie this rule: 1. Local mass prophylaxis activities need to be under way before the arrival of any federal assets. 2. Federal or state assistance will not include sufficient personnel to fully command or staff community-wide mass prophylaxis dispensing operations. 3. Mass prophylaxis operations are likely to remain under local control even after federal or state assets are delivered. 4. Dispensing and follow-up operations are likely to continue after the departure of federal or state assets . Once requested, assets from the SNS are likely to arrive in less time than it takes to set up a network of fully functional dispensing or vaccination centers. Each center must have a well-defined supply route linking it to the receive, store, and stage site for these SNS materials, as well as to any local stockpiles (see Fig. 12 .4). Most local stockpiles are predesignated for use by local first responders, hospitals, and emergency management personnel to ensure that they are ready to work with the public as soon as or before federal assets arrive. Onsite stockpile management requires the ability to ensure proper storage (eg, coolers), inventory management, and security of supplies. If the center is dispensing drugs or vaccines under investigational new drug protocols, local staff may have to track the patients to whom those supplies are distributed. However, recent legislative proposals call for the creation of emergency use authorizations (EUAs) to facilitate rapid dispensing of off-label or investigational medicines and vaccines in the setting of mass prophylaxis (Hupert et al., 2004) .",

In 2007 Congress cut BioWatch funding by $13 million, which was originally allocated for the purchase of new sensors. In a brief issued by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the annual estimated cost of maintenance and collection per city is $1 million, with a final program budget estimated at $85 million (Brodsky, 2007) .

A critical step in designing the BioWatch monitoring system was deciding where to site the air-sampling collectors. With a limited number of collectors to deploy and a multitude of potential sites, the goal was to maximize the probability that the network will detect the release of a biological agent while also maximizing the protection provided to the people of a given city. To reach this goal, the efficacy of each collector site and its contribution to the entire collector network had to be objectively evaluated using a standard set of metrics. To address this challenging problem, Los Alamos National Laboratory developed a geospatial application to provide analysts with a quantitative, decision-making tool for choosing collector sites. The BioWatch regional sensor siting tool (BioWatch tool) was developed within a commercial, off-the-shelf geographic information system (Linger, 2005) .",

These positive results came 1 day after a war protest took place on the Capitol Mall. DHS officials first suspected a problem when six sensors used in the BioWatch biological agent surveillance system collected air samples that indicated tularemia might have been present on the Mall. Subsequent testing at the CDC confirmed that there were low levels of tularemia bacteria on the Mall. However, those results were not considered entirely definitive under BioWatch standards; therefore DHS officials did not inform local public health officials in Washington for several days to avoid a public panic. In fact, it was not until September 30 that local health officials and the public were told to watch out for symptoms of the disease, which include chills, fever, headache, muscle aches, and pneumonia. DHS officials announced nearly a week later that the bacteria was naturally occurring and posed no health threat (Francis, 2006) .",

After all, BioWatch is a system that stands for early warning and detection. Second, whenever we look for a problem, we will eventually find it, but we are looking for things that occur naturally. So how do we sort out background levels of these natural pathogenic agents from something that truly poses a threat? The technologies being used to detect these agents merely tell us of their existence; they do not necessarily tell us that they are viable. Diagnostic methods based on an organism's genetic structure do not yield results equivocal to that sample's ability to infect a host.",

These included a lack of cooperation in regard to the reporting requirements and the lack of follow-through when after-action reports were received (DHS, Office of the Inspector General, 2007). One of the biggest issues with BioWatch has always been the cost of the program. As the program moves into advanced developmental phases, it has the potential to become what it was originally intended to be, an autonomous sampling and detection system. In fact, that has been the goal of the BioWatch Generation 3 (Gen-3) program. An autonomous, stand-alone detector was being sought by DHS-one that would replace the labor-intensive sample collectors that currently exist. Unfortunately, the BioWatch Gen-3 program was canceled (GAO Report, 2014) . BioWatch critics in Congress have managed to slow the program and derail advanced development efforts for the time being. However, the technology and commercially available hardware now exists to make the BioWatch program what it was always intended to be-a real-time early warning system for the detection of the most serious biothreat agents that might be released in high-risk areas. Time will tell if Bio-Watch will become an even more expensive reality or a foregone relic of the past.",

The type of data includes patient's symptoms, drug prescriptions (quantities and types), and the number of emergency visits (Levi, 2011 ).

The CDC used BioSense data and analyses to maintain situational awareness on the pandemic and aid in decision-making for their response division . In 2010 BioSense was used to monitor health-care trends in the southeast United States in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon Gulf Coast oil spill. The BioSense program has many advantages, but it has also been criticized over the years for some of its limitations and concerns about its effectiveness. Biosurveillance systems such as BioSense are limited by their timeliness, false-positive rates, and overall sensitivity (Dembek, 2007; Gostin, 2008) . BioSense is often thought of as an early detection or warning system, but some have opined that warning may come too late (Thoburn, et al., 2006) . It is the opinion of this author that the system has its merit and has done well to overcome the objections of its early critics. The system should remain in place.",

The LRN currently has two major components: a well-developed network of public health laboratories dealing with biological agents (Bio-LRN) and a smaller network of public health laboratories dealing with chemical agents. The LRN is an international network of more than 150 laboratories. The network includes the following types of laboratories: \u2022 Federal.

The LRN is one network that encompasses both bioterrorism and chemical terrorism preparedness and response. LRN bioterrorism preparedness and response activities emphasize local laboratory response by performing the following tasks: \u2022 Helping to increase the number of trained laboratory workers in state and local public health facilities, \u2022 Distributing standardized test methods and reagents to local laboratories and promoting the acquisition of advanced technologies, and \u2022 Supporting facility improvements.",

Samples can be (and have been) collected by numerous types of agencies: local hazardous materials response teams, civil support teams, the FBI's Hazardous Materials Response Unit (HMRU), and local emergency management agencies. All samples must be tested for chemical, explosive, and radiological/nuclear hazards before being transported to the LRN facility. In addition, all samples must include a chain of custody form and be transported to the LRN laboratory under the custody of a law enforcement official. Once the samples have arrived at the LRN facility, they are tested again for radiological hazards before being accepted into the laboratory.",

The FBI HMRU fulfills its mission through an integrated effort involving specialized response teams, a national training program, interagency liaison, technical assistance to FBI field and headquarters divisions, and the development of field response programs. The unit also trains, equips, and certifies FBI field office personnel for hazardous materials operations. The FBI HMRU responds to the scene of a credible act of bioterrorism to ensure that the crime scene is processed in accordance with established protocols for safety and evidence processing. This team has extensive experience from the Amerithrax incident and numerous other events that have taken place over the past few years. Formed in June 1996, the FBI HMRU is an example of a vision made reality in a very short time as the nation was preparing for the 1996 Olympics. The unit was envisioned by Dr. Randall Murch, chief of the Scientific Analysis Division of the FBI's Laboratory Division, and Dr. Drew Richardson, the HMRU director. At the time, the unit's philosophy was simple: at the site of a WMD incident, there might be scores of dead people about, but if you could not prove who did it, the likelihood of more victims in future incidents increases. Despite the extreme emotion of the moment, evidence has to be collected (Seiple, 1997) .",

Specifically, the DoD was mandated by Congress to share its expertise and capabilities for neutralizing, dismantling, and disposing of explosive ordnance as well as radiological, biological, and chemical materials. In addition, the DoD was asked to work toward the development and deployment of countermeasures against WMDs. In May 1998 Presidential Decision Directive 62, Protection Against Unconventional Threats to the Homeland and Americans Overseas, directed that the DoD assist other federal agencies, train first responders, and maintain specially trained military units to assist states with WMD response. Shortly thereafter, the National Guard formed 10 rapid assessment and initial detection units. These teams were designed to provide rapid response to a WMD incident and assist state and local responders. The 10 teams became what is now referred to as WMD Civil Support Teams (CSTs). Since that time, the National Guard has added more teams with the goal of having one for each state. Currently, specific locations for these teams are based on population concentrations and are intended to minimize the response times within particular geographic areas. They were also located to prevent overlapping team areas of responsibility.",

Furthermore, the CSTs are able to respond to all counties within the state or region, including distant island communities, by loading and flying vehicles on US Coast Guard or Air National Guard assets. Response time varies because of remoteness of locations; however, all team members are on 24-h alert at all times (Hurston et al., 2006) . It is important to note that CSTs will not take command of the scene of the incident. They are there to augment the local and state assets that arrive on scene with them. They will integrate into the command structure through their own unit commander. Their capabilities, assets, and level of training are impressive.",

At this point, isolates from case patients would be forwarded to a regional laboratory in the state's capitol city for further testing. If the isolate is found to test positive for one of the CDC bioterrorism agents (Category A, B, or C), an isolate would be sent to the national laboratory in Atlanta for definitive testing. The state bureau of investigation, the FBI, and a local joint terrorism task force would send agents to the community to work with epidemiologists to determine the source of the outbreak.

The task is further complicated by the added dimension that the disaster you may be preparing for will be due to an intentional, covert act that is strategically used in the areas where you are weakest. Such is the insidious nature of bioterrorism and biowarfare. Regardless, we may all find ourselves rather \"flat-footed\" if and when that moment comes, especially if we are unable to recognize early on that the problem exists. This is all the more dangerous if the agent that emerges is highly transmissible from person to person, the incubation period short, and the case-fatality rate high. A few examples that come to mind are smallpox, pneumonic plague, and pandemic influenza. Our hope is that BioWatch provides us with early detection, which of course depends on where the sensors are placed and what they monitor. Probably one of the best investments we have made along these lines is the establishment of the LRN. Having the ability to quickly and definitively identify the problem is a mainstay of the LRN's charter.
