Knowledge of the etiology of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction is fundamental for establishing the diagnosis and directing the work-up.

Unilateral testing of the sense of smell sometimes will show a loss on one side. CRS was viewed as a solely conductive cause of olfactory dysfunction, but more studies suggest that olfactory dysfunction secondary to CRS is caused by conductive and neural factors. Kern [4] looked at the histopathologic changes in the olfactory mucosa of patients who had CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery. Neuroepithelial inflammation was found with olfactory deficits, suggesting that inflammation of the olfactory epithelium, in addition to altered airflow, may contribute to olfactory losses.",

Patients with a true taste loss, however, often complain bitterly of their problems. Pathology along each segment of the gustatory pathway might lead to the alteration of taste: partial loss (hypogeusia), complete loss (ageusia), or a sensation of altered taste (dysgeusia). Taste distortion with stimulus (parageusia) or without stimulus (phantgeusia) also can occur. Viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections of the oral and hypopharyngeal mucosa may disturb taste. Radiation-induced mucositis also can impair taste sensation, and poor oral hygiene can cause loss or distortion of taste. The aging process adversely affects the sense of taste, but to a lesser degree than the sense of smell. Bitter and sour tastes are most likely to diminish with age, but the loss is generally only partial [44] . Neoplastic involvement of the floor of the mouth, submandibular space, or infratemporal lesion may produce a loss of taste. Smoking may have an adverse affect on taste sensitivity and discrimination.",

Patients then identify the quality of the taste and rate the intensity with a number from 1 to 10, with 10 being the strongest. The variation of this test is the three-drop technique, which involves placing three drops of a given chemical on a random portion of the tongue. The concentration is titrated to obtain the threshold of sensitivity. Recently, several tests have been developed in Germany that resemble this technique but are more standardized in the form of ''taste strips,'' wafers, or tablets with specific concentration of the stimuli [50] [51] [52] .
