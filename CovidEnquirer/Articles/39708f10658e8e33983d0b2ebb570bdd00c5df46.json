            "text": "Plant-based biomanufacturing of therapeutic proteins is a relatively new platform with a small number of commercial-scale facilities, but offers advantages of linear scalability, reduced upstream complexity, reduced time to market, and potentially lower capital and operating costs. In this study we present a detailed process simulation model for a large-scale new \"greenfield\" biomanufacturing facility that uses transient agroinfiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana plants grown hydroponically indoors under lightemitting diode lighting for the production of a monoclonal antibody. The model was used to evaluate the total capital investment, annual operating cost, and cost of goods sold as a function of mAb expression level in the plant (g mAb/kg fresh weight of the plant) and production capacity (kg mAb/year). For the Base Case design scenario (300 kg mAb/year, 1 g mAb/kg fresh weight, and 65% recovery in downstream processing), the model predicts a total capital investment of $122 million dollars and cost of goods sold of $121/g including depreciation. Compared with traditional biomanufacturing platforms that use mammalian cells grown in bioreactors, the model predicts significant reductions in capital investment and >50% reduction in cost of goods compared with published values at similar production scales. The simulation model can be modified or adapted by others to assess the profitability of alternative designs, implement different process assumptions, and help guide process development and optimization.",

As of November 2014, fortyseven mAb products have been approved in the US or Europe for the treatment of a variety of diseases, and many of these products have also been approved for other global markets. 1 At the current approval rate (an average of 4 new products per year), it is expected that over 70 mAb products will be on the market by 2020, and projected combined global sales by 2017 will be nearly $90 billion. 2 Currently, most protein-based therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines are made using traditional recombinant protein production platforms (e.g., mammalian or microbial cells cultured in stainless steel or single-use disposable bioreactor systems). The selling prices of pharmaceuticals are increasing along with global price inflation, and in turn, over half of the global population cannot afford critical medicines. Additionally, there is a growing need for manufacturing processes that can a) respond quickly to new or sudden medical needs (e.g., during the 2012-2015 Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and the 2016 Zika virus outbreaks), b) offer more rapid drug development, and c) lower drug prices to address emerging markets in less-developed areas of the world.",

            "text": "The use of E. coli culture may be more economical, but it remains limited to simple, non-glycosylated proteins, and often requires additional downstream processing steps to ensure proper protein folding and endotoxin-free product. Recently, production of recombinant biologics in plants has received considerable attention because the platform provides specific advantages over traditional microbial and animal cell cultures. Plants possess an exceptional biosynthetic capacity for expression of recombinant proteins without supporting growth of adventitious agents (e.g., prions, pathogenic viruses) harmful to patients. It is now routine for plant cells to be used in the production of complex proteins, such as IgA, IgG and IgM 3-5 or virus-like particles. 6, 7 The first plant-made therapeutic drug for human use was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012, 8 and over 16 plant-manufactured proteins in phase I, II, and III clinical trials are in progress. 9 The first transgenic plant expressing a recombinant therapeutic protein was described over 25 years ago 10 and was soon followed by the development of a transient expression system applied at laboratory-scale, 11 and subsequently at field-scale for production amplification. 12, 13 Higher expression levels were subsequently obtained using viral-based transient expression vectors combined with Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. 14 The new vectors facilitated the successful expression of a broader range of proteins in plants, and enabled an increase in drug development programs using plant-based technologies. These expression vectors such as magnICON \u00d215 and iBioLaunch TM16 created the opportunity for transient expression in plants to be adapted to contained, large-scale biomanufacturing facilities with quick development time, high flexibility and easy scale-up. 17 Since the bioreactor unit is a single plant, protein production can be scaled up in a linear fashion by simply growing more plants and increasing the number of plants in a batch. Traditional stirred-tank bioreactors for mammalian-cell biotherapeutic manufacturing require incremental scale-up from research scale to production scale. Each step must demonstrate comparability and incorporates many variable factors such as mixing mass transfer, heat transfer, and hydrodynamic shear. The linear scalability of the transient plant expression system results in a reduction in drug development time and provides comparable product quality during scale-up from pre-clinical research batches to commercial-scale post-approval manufacturing needs. This novel manufacturing format is associated with a simple raw material (plant biomass) grown using an inexpensive, chemically-defined nutrient solution and light. Upstream processing using transient plant expression systems is simpler and requires less capital expense/ investment than bioreactor-based processes. These systems can be deployed more readily to new markets, such as those in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.",

A process simulation using SuperPro Designer \u00d2 software was developed and run to perform a manufacturing cost analysis for a Base Case production of 300 kg/year of a purified mAb. The simulation assumed an expression level of 1 g mAb/kg fresh weight of biomass and downstream recovery of 65%. The total capital investment (CAPEX, US dollars, USD), total annual operating costs (OPEX, USD/year) and unit production costs (Cost of Goods Sold, COGS, USD/g mAb) were analyzed for the Base Case model. The simulations were also used to investigate the effects of expression level (g mAb/kg fresh weight (FW) of plant biomass) and facility production rate (kg mAb/year) on CAPEX, OPEX and COGS. Costs for validation, laboratory, quality control (QC), quality systems development and maintenance (QA) were also included to support a model that would conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) compliance. Although hypothetical, the simulated facility is based on our combined experiences in plant-based biomanufacturing, generally accepted bioprocess engineering design principles, and the large body of literature available on mAb purification processes. The techno-economic model predicts the total capital investment for a new facility that is built from scratch on greenfield land (not including the cost of land, which is site-specific), including costs for ancillary infrastructure (such as receiving/inventory warehousing, research/QC/QA laboratories and office space), and initial costs, including working capital, startup and validation. The total annual operating costs are the operating expenses incurred directly from the manufacturing processes for bulk drug substance production, but not including fill and finish/packaging operations. Product-specific costs associated with research and development, clinical trials, marketing, licensing and royalty payments, financing of capital, legal, regulatory affairs, batch failure, and other non-manufacturing costs are not included in the model.",

For the Base Case scenario, a production capacity of 300 kg mAb/year and expression level of 1 g mAb/kg fresh weight (FW) of plant biomass after standard gene optimization was assumed, along with a recovery of 65% in the downstream process. Expression levels above 1 g of mAb per kilogram of plant biomass have been observed in our laboratory, and pilot-scale experiments confirm this as a conservative assumption. Recovery of 60% to 80% has been reported for mAb production systems; 21 therefore, a conservative recovery of 65% was assumed. Alternative facilities were simulated by varying the expression level from 0.25 g mAb/kg FW to 5 g mAb/kg FW, keeping the production level at 300 kg mAb/year. The production capacity was modeled in the range from 25 kg mAb/year to 600 kg mAb/year at an expression level of 1 g mAb/kg FW. CAPEX and COGS were determined over these ranges. The general model can be used to investigate a wide range of \"what if\" scenarios to investigate the effect of process assumptions (such as age of plants used for agroinfiltration, ratio of agrobacteria to biomass in the agroinfiltration step, resin binding capacity and replacement frequency) economic assumptions (e.g., cost of utilities, labor, major equipment). The model can also be used to identify process bottlenecks (e.g., unit procedures where investment in additional pieces of equipment could increase throughput/production capacity).",

This is particularly important for emerging biomanufacturing industries, such as the plant-made pharmaceutical (PMP) industry, because there are only a few large-scale facilities currently in operation, including for vaccine production (excluded from this analysis). Companies need tools to help assess the economic feasibility of their proposed processes and the impact of different process inputs. For example, understanding of the major factors that influence costs of goods for CHO-based biomanufacturing facilities for recombinant proteins production has resulted in large reductions (as much as 100 fold) in operating expenses over the last two decades achieved by increasing product titers, improving downstream yields, improving equipment utilization, and deploying template platform processes. 23 We developed a process model and performed a techno-economic analysis for a biomanufacturing facility that produces a mAb bulk drug substance product using transient agroinfiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana) hydroponically grown indoors under light-emitting diode (LED) illumination. The model was based on published designs for a commercial-scale facility, 17 as well as estimated costs for equipment, labor, consumables, raw materials and energy. It includes material and energy balances on each unit operation as well as batch scheduling, including clean-in-place (CIP) and steam-in-place (SIP) operations as needed. The Base Case SuperPro Designer \u00d2 model developed in this study can be downloaded at the following website (http://ghs.ucdavis.edu/ pmpdownload.shtml). These models are useful for determining ranges of mAb selling price, production capacity and expression level that would be required for profitability of novel types of PMP facilities using current processing technology. For example, based on the assumptions and techno-economic analyses presented, to achieve COGS below $200/g, expression levels will need to be greater than about 0.4 g/kg FW at a production capacity of 300 kg/year, or, at an expression level of 1 g/kg FW, the production capacity needs to be greater than 110 kg/year.",

The Base Case model indicates potential targets to reduce the CAPEX, as well as the COGS in the PMP facility. In terms of total equipment cost, a significant portion of the equipment costs (39%) is associated with the lighting, racking, and hydroponic plant growth systems. However, these systems require very little maintenance compared to standard stainless steel bioreactors while providing the same long-term value. In particular, the complexity of cell culture bioreactors and associated process control systems requires a higher level of educated and experienced personnel for operation, troubleshooting, and maintenance. Thus, these capital investments in indoor hydroponic cultivation may result in savings in terms of labor and maintenance costs, and, compared with mammalian cell culture facilities, may expand opportunities for building biomanufacturing facilities in countries with limited infrastructure in biomanufacturing and cGMP operations. Furthermore, the design of the upstream portion of the facility uses rapidly developing technologies such as LED lighting, vertical farming, and hydroponics, all of which are expected to be reduced in cost or allow improved biomass densities for the same price, as new technologies are deployed. It is important to state that within SuperPro Designer \u00d2 it is difficult to \"value engineer\" innovative facilities and processes that do not have extensive databases.

The downstream processing includes harvesting, homogenization, centrifugation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, lyophilization, and packaging. The Base Case production capacity was also small (5 kg purified HRP/year), compared with our mAb study at 300 kg purified mAb/year, and the expression level was 240 mg HRP/ kg FW; their analysis indicated a high COGS of $1,279/g. However, they showed that by doubling the biomass productivity and expression level, improving downstream yield from 54% to 63%, and increasing the production capacity to 20 kg HRP/ year, the COGS was lowered to $611/g, resulting in an internal rate of return (IRR) of 26% for a selling price of $1,250/g. Interestingly, in their study they found that the downstream processing costs accounted for 80% of the total production costs, likely due to the relatively low costs of the upstream since greenhouse production is likely to be less expensive than indoor, hydroponic, LED-illuminated plant growth used in our Base Case. Tus e et al. presented a techno-economic analysis for the production of butyrylcholinesterase, a medical countermeasure against organophosphate nerve agents, in a large-scale PMP facility utilizing transient agroinfiltration of indoor hydroponically grown N. benthamiana. 18 The facility was designed for lower production (25 kg purified butyrylcholinesterase/year), lower expression level (0.5 g/kg FW) and lower downstream recovery (20%) than for our mAb Base Case. However, the COGS of $1,180/g obtained in that study agrees within 5% of the predictions made by our model ($1,140/g) when adjusted for production level, expression level and downstream recovery using adjustment factors obtained from Figs. 4 and 5.

Werner et al. 26 estimated the OPEX and COGS for a 250 kg/year CHO facility assuming a 1g/L titer and 70% yield in downstream processing as $65M/year and $260/g, respectively. From Figs. 4, and 5, adjusting for an improvement in yield from 65% to 70% in downstream processing and reduction in production capacity from 300 kg/year to 250 kg/year, a similar transient plantbased production facility is estimated to have an OPEX of $33M/year and COGS of $131/g, assuming an expression level of 1 g/kg FW. Thus, the plant-based facility is estimated to reduce the OPEX and COGS by about 50% over the CHO facility, even without taking inflation into consideration. In a more recent paper, 27 the downstream processing costs for a mAb produced using a conventional mammalian cell culture process at a high production capacity (1,000 kg/year) for a titer of 1 g/L was estimated to be $232/g. Even at a much lower production capacity (600 kg/year), the plant-based system thus has a COGS of \u00bb$99/g, including both upstream and downstream process operations, representing a >50% reduction in manufacturing costs. While there are a number of published reports of low COGS for mAbs produced in mammalian cell cultures, many of these estimates are for facilities with very large production capacities. For example, for mAbs produced in conventional batch CHO bioreactors, Kelly 28 estimated COGS to range from $134/g at 1,000 kg/year to $26/g at 10,000 kg/year, Walther et al. 23 predicts a COGS of $22/g at 1,537 kg/year, and Petrides et al. 29 estimates a COGS of $86/g at 1,580 kg/year and a CAPEX of $512M, including startup and validation, in 2013 USD. These production capacities for a single facility are at the high end, considering the total production of 31 full-length mAbs produced in mammalian cell culture was 8,182 kg in 2013. 1 MAbs, as well as other biotherapeutics, tend to be developed for smaller patient populations, and will require a large number of small to intermediate size (10 to 100 kg/yr) production facilities. While the mAbs currently on the market vary significantly in terms of production level and sales, the average production capacity is about 250-300 kg/year and the average mAb selling price is $1,450/g. 1 As cost of manufacturing goes down, new markets are opening with demand below 50 kg/year. Expansion of mAb biomanufacturing to low and middle income countries with platform technologies that have lower CAPEX and OPEX than current mammalian cell production systems will be favored. Based on the techno-economic model presented, plant-based biomanufacturing using transient agroinfiltration appears to be a promising platform for these applications as well. However, it is expected that there will be continual improvements in costs and cell line development speed in mammalian as well as in plant-based manufacturing platforms.",

            "text": "The facility's upstream processing (Fig. 1) is split into four parts: growing N. benthamiana, growing A. tumefaciens, vacuum infiltration, and protein production in a post-infiltration plant incubation step. A mechanical seeder (GBX-101) places seeds on Rockwool plugs into Styrofoam TM germination trays with a capacity of 240 plants per tray, and a total of 4092 germination trays are required per batch to achieve the Base Case annual production target of 300 kg of purified mAb, corresponding to about 982,000 viable plants per batch. Seeded trays are placed onto aluminum trays (4 germination trays per aluminum tray) and conveyed to vertical racks (GBX-102) in a temperature and humidity controlled room (Fig. 6) , where they are given optimized amounts of light and nutrients for 3 weeks of germination and seedling growth (GBX-102 to GBX-104). After germination, the plants are transplanted by a mechanical transplanter (GBX-105) from the germination trays to \"grow trays\" preloaded with an inert hydroponic root support matrix at a rate of 2 trays per minute. Each grow tray holds 320 plants. A total of 3,069 grow trays are processed per batch, and the same number of plants (982,000) is retained. Transplanted trays are moved to a separate temperature and humidity controlled growth room and added to vertical racks (GBX-106) as described above. Plant biomass continues to grow for another 2 weeks (GBX-106 to GBX-107) under optimized amounts of light and nutrients. At the end of the fifth week, the plants are ready for vacuum agroinfiltration. In parallel to plant growth, inoculation of Luria-Bertani (LB) media is prepared in single-use bags (SDLB-101), and is sterilized using a 0.22 mm dead-end polishing filter (DE-101). LB media is then inoculated with A. tumefaciens clones containing the viral-based expression vectors with the mAb genes (light chain (LC), and heavy chain (HC) of mAb genes are cloned in separate vectors). An inoculum is prepared in 4 L flasks (SFR-101 and SFR-102) from working cell banks. Selection antibiotics are used in the shake flasks to ensure only the desired clones of A. tumefaciens are grown. After about 14 h of fermentation, the broths containing the strains are transferred into separate disposable bioreactors (RBS-101 and RBS-102), where they are grown for about 11 h to provide sufficient bacterial culture for the plant infiltration cycle. A single-use bioreactor was chosen to limit the cleaning and validation cost required for reusable stainless steel equipment. As plant infiltration is performed at pH 5.6 to allow the activation of Agrobacterium virulence genes, a concentrated stock solution of 1 M MES buffer, pH 5.6 is prepared in another single-use bag (SDLB-102), and then sterilized by using a 0.22 mm dead-end filter (DE-102). The infiltration procedure starts with the dilution of the 2 A. tumefaciens cultures in MES buffer pH 5.6 using an in-line mixer/diluter (MX-101) fed to the vacuum infiltrators (GBX-108). Five-weekold N. benthamiana plants are then inverted and immersed into the diluted suspension of the A. tumefaciens in the vacuum infiltrator. A moderate vacuum is briefly applied to remove air from the interstitial space of the leaf, and the vacuum is quickly released to allow penetration of Agrobacteria into the inner tissue of the leaves effectively transfecting the leaf cells. As plants exit the infiltrator, water is sprayed to rinse away extra Agrobacteria from the surface of the leaves. The entire infiltration process takes about 26 h to complete for one batch with 2 automated 33 ft vacuum infiltration systems. After agroinfiltration, plants are conveyed to a separate temperature and humidity controlled room and added to vertical racks (GBX-109) as described above, where the mAb is produced over a 7-day incubation period.",

These factors are different for the upstream and downstream portions of the facility to reflect the fact that the upstream plant growth and vacuum agroinfiltration steps take place following Good Agricultural Practices in a very simple open warehouse-type type facility, requiring minimal stainless steel piping, instrumentation, and auxiliary facilities. The downstream process is designed for cGMP operation, and thus is highly instrumented, requiring biopharmaceuticalgrade materials, classified environments, and extensive auxiliary systems.

Operating labor was estimated by allocating process operator hours required per equipment operation, preparation, and cleaning time (60%) and other tasks not directly associated with process operations (40%) for downstream unit operations and allocating manufacturing operator hours required per equipment operation time (100%) for upstream operations. Other labor-dependent cost items such as shift supervisors, benefits, QC, QA, administration and laboratory services were estimated as a multiplier to operator labor costs. For the upstream portion of the process, the laboratory, QC and QA costs were assumed to be 15% of the total labor costs for the upstream; for the downstream portion of the process, the laboratory, QC and QA costs were assumed to be 50% of the total labor costs for the downstream. The annual cost of reagents (salts and buffers) and consumables including hydroponic support matrices, filtration membranes, and chromatography resins were calculated on the basis of process requirements. For example, for CEXC resin, a cost of $1,650/L and 80 cycles before replacement was assumed for the simulation. For TFF membrane cost, $1,553/m 2 and 100 cycles were used. The cost of chemicals was obtained from the 2015-16 Chemical Market Reporter, from large-scale suppliers, or extrapolated from published pricing for smaller quantities. Total annual operating costs reported in this study include materials (e.g., chemicals, supplies), facility-dependent costs (maintenance, depreciation, insurance, local taxes, factory expense), consumables, operating labor, supervision, QA/QC and lab charges, and utilities (e.g., electricity, steam, chilled water). Some of the unit procedures needed for the process model were not available in SuperPro Designer \u00d2 (e.g., plant growth racks, seeder, transplanter, vacuum chamber, harvester and disintegrator) and so were modeled with generic boxes. Depreciation was calculated based on straight-line depreciation over a 10-year period with a salvage value of 5% of the DFC.",
