            "text": "In a feeding trial, sows and piglets were fed with the probiotic bacterium Bacillus cereus var. toyoi as a feed additive, and the effects on immune cell populations were examined. The development of the gut immune system was determined for piglets at the ages of 14, 28, 35 and 56 days post partum. Tissue samples of the Jejunum and the continuous Peyer's patch were used for enumeration of intraepithelial lymphocyte populations by fluorescence activated flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Both independent methods of investigation led to similar results: the population of intraepithelial CD8+ T cells was significantly enhanced in the probiotic group piglets ( p 0.05), and the numbers of gd T cells tended to be higher in the intestinal epithelium ( p < 0.1) at the time of weaning (day 28). Lamina propria lymphocytes were also influenced by the treatment. Application of B. cereus var. toyoi resulted in significantly more CD25+ lymphocytes and gd T cells in the probiotic group post-weaning. The occurrence of pathogenic Escherichia coli serogroups was also less frequent in the feces of piglets from the probiotic group. The finding that the CD8+ T cell population in the intestinal mucosa showed changes on day 28 indicated that the influence of B. cereus var. toyoi supplementation on the intestinal immune system started before weaning, an observation supported by changes in the intestinal microflora observed during the suckling-period. The results suggest that feeding of B. cereus var. toyoi to sows may result in beneficial effects on piglet health status independent of their feed supplementation. #",

            "text": "The recent ban on antibiotics as antimicrobial growth promoters in the European Union has stimulated the interest in probiotic feed supplements in livestock farming as an alternative means of reducing infectious bacterial loads in animal stock. Many of the bacterial species already used as probiotics are members of the indigenous (commensal) intestinal flora of the host (de Champs et al., 2003; Jin et al., 2000) . These commensals naturally colonize the intestinal tract, which is one important quality that makes them candidates for use as probiotics (Massi et al., 2004) . In addition, autochthonous bacteria are involved in the development and maintenance of oral tolerance against food antigens (Moreau and Corthier, 1988; Tanaka and Ishikawa, 2004) . However, commensal bacterial species would not be expected to stimulate mucosal or systemic immune responses, at least not as long as they do not breach the intestinal barrier or enter the bloodstream (Scharek et al., 2005; Westendorf et al., 2005) . Under normal conditions, commensal bacteria should be tolerated by the local immune system of the host, and only a few studies have www.elsevier.com/locate/vetimm Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 120 (2007) [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] [147] reported immune stimulatory effects of indigenous bacteria (Talham et al., 1999) . Bacterial colonization of the gut and infection by enteropathogens also has an impact on the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) associated with the intestinal tract. Consistent with this, as early as 1 month post partum, specific pathogen free pigs show lower amounts of IELs than conventional pigs of the same age (Rothk\u00f6tter et al., 1999) .",

A number of studies have assigned probiotic characteristics to this particular Bacillus strain (NCIMB 40112; ToyoCerin 1 ), and it has been authorized in the EU for use as a probiotic feed additive for sows and piglets and several other farm animal species. In animal studies with various strains of B. cereus, positive effects such as increased weight gain, improved feed conversion ratios and lower mortality rates of piglets have been reported Alexopoulos et al., 2001) , and B. cereus var. toyoi was correlated with a reduced incidence of post-weaning diarrhoea (Taras et al., 2005a) . However, since B. cereus var. toyoi is not a member of the indigenous intestinal flora of pigs and produces a strong hemolysin (P. Schierack, personnel communication) , we considered the possibility that it might be more immunogenic compared to other probiotics. Indeed, immunogenic properties of B. cereus spores have been shown previously in mice, resulting in expression of inflammatory cytokines in the gut and modest, spore-specific IgG titers. Furthermore, the in vitro-germination of spores in macrophages initiates the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression (Duc le et al., 2004) .",

To establish the complete, longterm effects on the immune system, both sows as well as the piglets of the probiotic group were treated throughout the course of the study. For sows, feed supplementation started 25 days after insemination. Sows were fed throughout pregnancy, with feed supplementation continuing during lactation. Litter size within each treatment group was adjusted to meet an exclusion criterion of at least nine but not more than 15 living piglets 24 h after birth. Piglets of the probiotic group had free access to supplemented feed beginning on day 15 post partum, and received the same probiotic supplement during and postweaning (day 28). A group of 10, untreated sows and their piglets served as the control group for the study. Housing facilities for sows and piglets of both treatment groups were of identical construction and environmental conditions and spatially separated from each other. The lighting program was 16 h light and 8 h of darkness. The room temperature and relative humidity were adjusted to 21.5 8C and 65.0%, respectively. The mean concentration (AE S.D.) of the supplemented B. cereus var. toyoi in the food for gestating sows, lactating sows, nursed piglets and weaned piglets were determined as 2.6 (AE 1.0) \u00c2 10 5 , 4.0 (AE 1.2) \u00c2 10 5 , 1.3 (AE 0.5) \u00c2 10 6 and 1.4 (AE 0.4) \u00c2 10 6 cfu/g dry weight food, respectively, as previously described (Taras et al., 2005a) . From each treatment group a total of five litters were randomly chosen and one piglet per litter was selected at random at the end of days 14, 28, 35 and 56 (i.e., 20 piglets per treatment), to gain tissue samples.

We applied two different methods to determine changes in lymphocyte populations, fluorescence activated cell scanning (FACS), and immunohistochemistry of tissue samples. Both methods yielded consistent results with regard to the age-dependent development of CD45+ cell populations throughout the Cell counts of all animals tested at any time point of the study were combined. entire jejunal tissue sections analysed (epithelium and Lamina propria mucosae), and showed an increasing fraction of CD45+ cells. The protocol used for the purification of intestinal epithelium leukocytes for flow cytometry retains the epithelial cells in the cell suspension. Using this procedure, this allowed us to follow the development of leukocyte numbers relative to epithelial cell numbers rather than only the proportional shifts between different lymphocyte populations. We found between 18% and 24% IELs (CD45+) in the jejunal epithelium of the control group at the age of 28 days. This fraction of leukocytes within the cell suspension is consistent with previous determinations reported by Rothk\u00f6tter et al. (1994) , who measured the portion of CD2+ cells in suspension after EDTA incubation of jejunal tissue samples. In a second study, Rothk\u00f6tter et al. (1999) reported 15-19% IELs within 1 month old piglet jejunal epithelium in stained tissue sections and found that the number of IELs was lower in specific pathogen free pigs compared to conventional animals. These observations indicate that the proliferation of IELs is influenced by the intestinal flora. The higher portion of CD45+ cells in the epithelial fraction determined by our analysis (up to 60% at the age of 2 months) is probably due to the exclusion of the dead cells from the calculation (stained with propidium iodide). The fraction of dead cells varied between 25% and 35% in the cell preparations (data not shown), with most of them originating from epithelial cells. With both methods of assessing CD45+ cells, no significant differences between control animals and probiotic piglets were observed, although the average number of leukocytes tended to be higher in the probiotic group. There was no or only a limited influence of B. cereus on the morphology of the mucous membrane of the piglets with regard to villus height and crypt depth. Neither the number of goblet cells was significantly affected by the treatment (Reiter et al., 2006) , and no symptoms of inflammation were found in the intestinal mucosa (K. Weyrauch, personnel communication).",

For example, CD3/CD8 double-positive IELs were significantly higher in the epithelial layer of the probiotic animals at day 28 post partum (Fig. 4) . A similar tendency was previously observed for the population of CD8+ T cells in the blood of the probiotic piglets (Altherr, 2005 ). An increase in mucosal CD8+ cells without signs of intestinal inflammation was also recently reported after the treatment of pigs with E. coli Nissle (Duncker et al., 2006) . In addition, the portion of TcR1+ (gd) T cells tended to be higher in the probiotic group (Fig. 2) . These differences were found to be significant in an ANOVA analysis considering the data from the whole sampling period (data not shown). TcR1+ lymphocytes were only rarely detected in the epithelium microscopically, but consistently abundant in the Lamina propria of the jejunal tissue samples. Since the numbers of epithelial gd T cells determined by flow cytometry amounted to less than 5% of total cells in over a third of all samples, it was not possible to apply statistical data analysis in this instance. However, Lamina propria gd T-cells were significantly higher in the probiotic animals at the age of 35 days ( p 0.05). The increased numbers of CD3/CD8 double-positive IELs and gd T cells in the Lamina propria mucosae might be interpreted as an accelerated development of the intestinal immune system. The control animals reached similar numbers of CD8+ IELs and mucosal gd T cells at the age of 56 days.",

This fraction of gd T-cells merges in the CD8 population, and with the available surface antigen staining we were unable to differentiate between the CD8+ and CD8\u00c0 gd T cells in the current animal study. Discrimination between CD8 high and CD8 low cells is not feasible with IELs because almost all CD8+ cells from the intestinal epithelium show a bright fluorescence. The CD8 low population found in blood samples of pigs harbours the CD4/CD8 double-positive subtype of memory helper cells (Yang and Parkhouse, 1996; Zuckermann, 1999) . Recently, Denyer et al. (2006) showed that a subset of CD4/CD8 double-positive Tcells also produce perforin and therefore appear to represent cytotoxic T-cells. In our study, CD4/CD8 double-positive T cells were absent in the jejunal epithelium as shown by flow cytometry analysis (data not shown). In blood samples, a considerable fraction of the CD8+ cells is CD3\u00c0, and was therefore considered to represent NK cells (Krog et al., 2003; Denyer et al., 2006) . The percentage of the latter CD8+ CD3\u00c0 cells in the IEL fraction of most piglets is below 5%, and no impact of ToyoCerin treatment on this cell population was observed (data not shown). Results obtained in situ with immune histochemical investigations concerning the development of the intraepithelial CD8+ cells were consistent with flow cytometry determinations: CD8+ cells were significantly ( p 0.05) enhanced in the epithelium of probiotic piglets at the age of 35 days (Fig. 5) .",

However, at the time when the flow data show significant differences (day 28) the tissue data showed tendencies in the same direction. The cell suspensions for flow cytometry originate from a whole cell preparations with full cell surface exposure, whereas the samples for the immunohistology originate from thin sections which do not expose more than one layer of tissue or cells and therefore likely underestimate the presence of the labelled cells.",

In the absence of further information about the expression status of perforin, we consider the CD8/ CD3 double-positive cells in the epithelium to be cytotoxic T-cells. In addition, the CD8/CD3 doublepositive cells do not represent a uniform cell population, since the gd T-cells also partially merge with this cell fraction.

From the mouse model it is known that CD4+/CD25+ T cells are able to suppress the development of colitis and Th1 cytokine production (Kanai et al., 2006) . However, since there were no differences between the groups concerning the number of CD4+ cells, we consider it unlikely that the increased CD25+ cells in the Lamina propria are regulatory T cells (Veltkamp et al., 2006) . We therefore suggest the increase in Lamina propria CD25+ cells in the current study is indicative of an immune stimulation (Bailey et al., 1992) . Furthermore, the observed increase in CD8+ IELs from day 14 post partum (Fig. 4) is suggestive of a more developed gut-associated immune system of the probiotic group piglets at weaning age or earlier.",

Applying the definition of diarrhoea as liquid feces on at least two consecutive days, only 23 piglets (27.4%) from the probiotic group showed such signs of diarrhoea compared to 52 (67.5%) of the control piglets ( p < 0.001) (Taras et al., 2005a) . These observations might imply that the improved health performance of the treated animals may in part be due to the immunemodulating effect of B. cereus var. toyoi described in this communication. In addition, as noted above, B. cereus var. toyoi affected the intestinal flora of the piglets before weaning, indicating that the administration of the probiotic to the sows is probably an important factor for the subsequent beneficial effects in the piglets. Supportive of this suggestion, it has been shown that piglets take up several grams (about 20 g) of feces per day (Sansom and Gleed, 1982) . Indeed, prior to weaning the piglets in this animal trial apparently took up more probiotic bacteria with the feces of the mother sows than with the supplemented feed (Taras et al., 2005a) . Consistent with a mean B. cereus var. toyoi concentration of 9.6 (+ 1.9) \u00c2 10 5 /g dry matter (DM) in feces of probiotic sows seven days post partum, feces of probiotic piglets collected on day 7 already contained 1.3 (+ 0.3) \u00c2 10 5 probiotic cfu/g DM. Probiotic bacteria were also detected in digesta of piglets on day 14, i.e., before supplemented prestarter feed was offered. The concentration of viable cell counts in the colon ascendens approximately doubled from day 14 (before supplemented feed was offered to the suckling piglets) to day 28 (before piglets were weaned), which means only a slight increase in microbial cell counts. On day 35 (6 days after weaning) the concentration of viable cell counts of B. cereus was already five times higher than that at day 28 (Taras et al., 2005a) . Furthermore, the numbers of CD3+ CD8+ cells tended to be higher in the probiotic piglets even before day 28. For these reasons, we suggest that the probiotic feeding of the sows has a greater impact on the immune system of the piglets than the uptake of supplemented feed by the piglets before weaning.",

However, pathogenic E. coli serogroups were less frequent in the probiotic piglets (Fig. 8B) . On the other hand, there was neither a temporal accumulation of these E. coli serovars in the piglets' feces, nor was the occurrence of pathogenic E. coli serovars clearly correlated with diarrhoea or other symptoms of disease in the piglets. Hence, no direct correlation between the immunological changes and the differences in the E. coli frequency was apparent. Furthermore, high numbers of E. coli harbouring virulence genes and/or with hemolytic activity do not necessarily correlate with disease (Schierack et al., 2006) . Nevertheless, we suggest that the occurrence or absence of these pathogen-associated serovars is an indication of the immune status and the health condition of the animals. The E. coli pathovars may be expected to influence the immune system of the animals and vice versa.",

            "text": "In contrast to a previous animal study with the probiotic Enterococcus faecium SF68 (NCIMB 10415), we found that B. cereus toyoi had a different effect on the development of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Enterococcus faecium is a normal, autochthonous inhabitant of the porcine gut, and therefore may not be expected to stimulate the piglets' immune system (Scharek et al., 2005) . In contrast, B. cereus var. toyoi does not belong to the normal intestinal flora in the pigs, and the intestinal milieu is an unnatural habitat for this sporeforming soil inhabitant. B. cereus apparently sporulates in the intestinal tract after initial germination and shows limited rounds of growth and division cycles in the gut (Taras et al., 2005a; Jadamus et al., 2001) . It remains unclear whether spores or metabolically active bacteria are responsible for the observed changes in the intestinal immune system. However, previous reports have indicated that spores can be immunostimulatory and lead to increased expression of certain cell activation markers after oral administration, e.g., CD25 on peripheral-blood lymphocytes (Duc le et al., 2004; Caruso et al., 1993) . It therefore seems likely that the observed immune stimulation in the probiotic group of piglets was triggered by microbial antigens. However, as noted above, it has been shown that B. cereus var. toyoi promotes changes in the composition of the gut flora in pigs (Jadamus et al., 2001) . In view of the complexity of the microbial flora, it cannot be excluded that B. cereus var. toyoi affects other microbial populations which are ultimately responsible for the observed immune modulation.",

In contrast to CD8+ cells in peripheral blood preparations, most CD8+ cells in the jejunal epithelium are T-cells, and CD8+ CD3\u00c0 Natural Killer cells were rare in the epithelium. Furthermore, CD25+ cell counts were enhanced in the Lamina propria mucosae. This apparent immune modulation was transitory and occurred during the most critical phase of the piglets' development with respect to intestinal infections. In addition, the frequency of pathogen-associated E. coli serogroups were less frequent in the probiotic-treated piglets. Taking the performance data of Taras et al.
