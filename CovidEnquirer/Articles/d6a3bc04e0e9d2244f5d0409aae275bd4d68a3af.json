            "text": "Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis literally means \"bone death\" (ossis [Latin] = bone; necrosis = killing or causing to die). Synonyms include avascular necrosis, ischemic necrosis of bone, aseptic necrosis, and subchondral avascular necrosis. Although the term osteonecrosis dissecans is sometimes used synonymously with osteonecrosis, strictly speaking, it is a consequence of osteonecrosis involving fragmentation of bone that leads to fracturing or cracking of bone. The concept of bone death was first described by Hippocrates, 1 but the first clinical description of osteonecrosis was a case of sepsis-induced bone death described by Russell in 1794. 2 The first description of the occurrence of bone death in the absence of infection was published almost a century later. 3 The first report of osteonecrosis in a deep sea diver appeared in 1936. 4 The pathogenesis of osteonecrosis is complex, and immune regulation of bone homeostasis may play a significant role, but ultimately, bone death occurs as a result of complete or partial disruption of the delivery of oxygen and/or nutrients to the bone and surrounding tissues. It is likely that multiple molecular mechanisms must be in play simultaneously for osteonecrosis to occur. [5] [6] [7] EPIDEMIOLOGY The prevalence of osteonecrosis is unknown, but it is estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 new patients are diagnosed every year in the United States. Osteonecrosis occurs in 15% to 80% of patients with femoral neck fractures. 6 Osteonecrosis is believed to be the cause of 10% of the 500,000 hip replacements performed in the United States each year. 8 Osteonecrosis primarily affects men, with the notable exception of osteonecrosis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, which has a significant female predominance. Osteonecrosis primarily occurs in the third to fifth decade of life, 9 and consequently, long-term morbidity can be significant because most hip replacements have a finite period of viability.",

The strength of a causal relationship varies greatly, and in some cases only case reports have been published. The most common cause of nontraumatic osteonecrosis is corticosteroid use, which was first described in 1957. 11 Although other adverse effects of corticosteroids are perhaps better known, osteonecrosis of the femoral head is one of the more serious complications. Clearly there exist individual susceptibility differences that are not predictive, and therefore it is important that steroids be prescribed only when indicated and only for the length of time required. As will be discussed, although it is safe for some people to take morbidity associated with it, osteonecrosis is an important complication to consider when prescribing corticosteroids.",

Because several forms of corticosteroids exist with differing potencies and half-lives, and because dosages and duration of use vary between studies, any conclusions about a \"safe\" dose of corticosteroids are fraught with potential confounding variables and errors. In a study of 20 patients diagnosed with stage 1 osteonecrosis by MRI, the interval between the use of steroids and diagnosis ranged from 1 to 16 months. 12 The cumulative dose of steroids in this study ranged from 1800 to 15,505 mg (mean, 5928 mg) of prednisolone or the equivalent. In other studies, cumulative doses of steroids associated with osteonecrosis ranged from 480 13 to 4320 14 mg of dexamethasone dose equivalence. In a 2010 article, Powell and colleagues 15 collectively analyzed the available literature to derive maximum safe levels for duration, maximum daily dose, and average daily dose of corticosteroids. The study confirmed that many other confounding variables affect the development of osteonecrosis, making analysis of dose-response risk for an isolated association difficult. Nonetheless, corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis is dependent on dosage, and the risk is higher with long-acting steroids and with parenteral usage.",

The incidence of osteonecrosis in a group of patients receiving glucocorticoid replacement therapy for primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency was 2.4%. In a study of patients undergoing renal transplantation, the 26 patients in whom osteonecrosis developed had taken a higher cumulative oral dose of prednisone after 1 and 3 months compared with 28 control patients undergoing renal transplantation in whom osteonecrosis did not develop. 16 A separate study estimated the incidence of osteonecrosis in patients undergoing renal transplant to be 5%. 17 No consistent evidence links the use of topical, inhaled, or nasal corticosteroids to osteonecrosis. The evidence for an association between osteonecrosis and intramuscular or intra-articular corticosteroids is limited to case reports. 18 Parenteral use poses a higher risk because of the rapid absorption and longer half-life of the drugs used. Bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw is particularly interesting because the intended beneficial use of bisphosphonates with regard to bone diseases instead leads to a serious bone complication itself. [19] [20] [21] Other associations include a link between cigarette smoking and osteonecrosis, with smokers having a threefold higher relative risk for the development of osteonecrosis, independent of all other factors. 22, 23 The association between osteonecrosis and alcohol consumption was first described in 1922. 24 A study of patients with idiopathic osteonecrosis revealed that the risk of osteonecrosis increased with increasing daily consumption of alcohol. 23 The subjects were divided into three groups on the basis of their alcohol consumption of less than 400 mL/week, 400 to 1000 mL/ week, and greater than 1000 mL/week, and the relative risk of osteonecrosis for these groups, independent of corticosteroid use or smoking, was 3-fold, 10-fold, and 18-fold, respectively. It was also found that liver damage is not necessary for the development of osteonecrosis in patients who large doses of steroids for long periods, avascular necrosis will develop in other patients who take smaller doses over shorter periods.",

The severity of the pain can vary, depending on the size of the infarct and whether the onset of disease is insidious or sudden. When sudden and severe disruption of blood flow occurs in trauma, and when large infarcts occur in the presence of Gaucher's disease, dysbarism, or hemoglobinopathy, pain can be intense and sudden. In other conditions with a more insidious onset, the pain can follow a gradual and slow incremental progression. The pain of osteonecrosis is usually increased with use of the joint, but in individuals with advanced disease, the pain can be persistent at rest.

            "text": "The Ficat and Arlet method of staging osteonecrosis consists of four stages. Stages 1 and 2 are reversible, whereas stage 3 (subchondral collapse) and stage 4 (joint space narrowing and destruction of cartilage) are irreversible. The Marcus staging system consists of six stages, with the first two reversible and the subsequent four stages irreversible. The modified Steinberg staging system is based on the Marcus system and also consists of six stages. Each stage is further divided into three subclasses on the basis of the extent of femoral head involvement. In subclass A, involvement is less than 25%; in subclass B, 26% to 50% of the femoral head is involved; and in subclass C, greater than 50% of the femoral head is involved. Table 103 -2 shows the Modified Steinberg system for staging osteonecrosis. The Association of Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) has proposed a modification to the Ficat and Arlet system, adding a stage 0 for patients with negative findings of imaging studies but who are at risk for the development of osteonecrosis. In addition, stages 1 and 3 are further stratified to take into account lesion size, location, and extent of collapse. 80 In 2001 the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare proposed revising criteria for the diagnosis and staging of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. 81 Diagnostic criteria included (1) collapse of the consume alcohol, although elevated liver enzymes may be present. 25 The incidence of osteonecrosis in patients who received treatment for alcoholism was 5.3%. The femoral head was again the most common site (representing 82 of 92 lesions), with the other 10 lesions in the humeral head. 26 Musculoskeletal conditions can lead to osteonecrosis in children. Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease was first described in children between 3 and 12 years of age in 1910. [27] [28] [29] Femoral head osteonecrosis is a feature of this disease and has been linked to trauma, 30, 31 congenital hip dislocation, 32 and transient synovitis. 33 Bilateral involvement is common, and associated clinical manifestations include abnormal growth and stature, 34, 35 delayed skeletal maturation, 36 disproportionate skeletal growth, 35 congenital anomalies, 37 and abnormal hormone levels. 38, 39 Osteonecrosis can develop in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well, 40, 41 but this phenomenon may be a result of steroid use. An additional risk factor for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been found to be high body mass index. 42 Osteonecrosis has also been associated with metabolic disorders and pregnancy. Diagnosis is often delayed in mothers until months after delivery. Women who experience osteonecrosis during pregnancy tend to have a small body frame and a large weight gain. 43 Hematologic conditions have been associated with osteonecrosis. The long-term morbidity of osteonecrosis in patients with sickle cell anemia is dismal. 44 Common issues include decreased mobility, abnormal gait, and leg-length discrepancy. 45 Osteonecrosis in patients with hemophilia has been reported, but no statistically reliable causal link has been established. [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] Dysbaric osteonecrosis has been reported in construction workers exposed to high pressure environments, such as the Elbe tunnel, and may have been a feature of the first report of Caisson disease. 52 The prevalence of dysbaric osteonecrosis is 4.2% in divers and 17% in workers exposed to compressed air. 53 Patients with dysbaric osteonecrosis may have more than one lesion; in addition to the femoral head, common sites include the tibia and the humeral head and shaft. The condition is not related to decompression sickness, and although proper decompression procedures can reduce the incidence of \"the bends,\" they do not have any effect on the development of osteonecrosis, which can occur months or years after the last exposure to highpressure environments.",

The mechanism of action of bisphosphonate-induced ONJ appears to parallel that of glucocorticoids, with derangement in lipid metabolism, bone homeostasis, and apoptosis of bone cells all playing a role. It is interesting that the jawbone seems to be the most vulnerable bone in bisphosphonate-induced disease, as opposed to the femoral head in most other associations or causes of osteonecrosis. This phenomenon may be a result of the high bone turnover rate in the jaw or because bisphosphonates exert their action not only on bone but also on many elements of the surrounding tissue, including fibroblasts and blood vessels.",

Raloxifene is a nonsteroidal benzothiophene that is used as an estrogen receptor modulator to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and to reduce the risk of breast cancer. 85 Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) that is used in the treatment of osteoporosis, has also been implicated in ONJ.

Small vessels known as retinacular arteries, which are ascending cervical branches of the extracapsular ring, form an intra-articular ring at the level of the cartilage. Epiphyseal arterial branches arise from this ring and penetrate the head and neck of the femur, including the epiphyses. The artery of the ligament of the head of the femur is a branch of the obturator artery and may be the sole supplier of blood to the proximal fragment of the head. Some of these anatomic features may render the femoral head particularly vulnerable to ischemia. The retinacular arteries are believed to supply 80% of the femoral epiphysis. Compromise of this critical vascular system may lead to osteonecrosis originating in the anterosuperior aspect of the femoral head, as indicated by angiographic studies in early osteonecrosis in which these arteries are not visualized. A schematic of the blood supply to the femoral head is shown in Figure 103 Histologically, after an infarct, a rim of bony thickening or sclerosis begins to form at the margins of the infarcted area. If the necrotic lesion is within the weight-bearing region of the femoral head, subchondral fractures occur. With repeated microfractures and continued weight bearing, the original fracture cannot heal completely and new fractures appear. The secondary fracture propagates along the junction between subchondral bone and the necrotic segment. As time goes on, the femoral head becomes flattened and eventually collapses. A nonspherical head articulating with the acetabulum produces friction, erosion, and loss of cartilage.

In a study of patients with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease, bone scintigraphy using technetium 99m methylene diphosphonate (Tc 99m MDP) was used to measure arterial and venous flow in the diseased hip. Although arterial flow was normal, venous drainage was significantly disrupted. 97 This disturbance was reproduced in a dog model in which injection of silicone was used to obstruct venous flow distal to the hip. 98 Ischemia resulted from the obstruction to venous drainage, leading to a cessation of endochondral ossification in the preosseous epiphyseal cartilage and the physeal plate. Widening of the joint space ensued, followed by revascularization of the epiphysis and deposition of new, immature bone. A weakened or unstable femoral epiphyseal plate resulted, and the subchondral bone became prone to segmental collapse and fracture. 99 The pathologic mechanism of dysbaric osteonecrosis is unclear. The most intuitive explanation is that formation of gas bubbles causes arterial occlusion and ischemia. However, the true mechanism may not be quite so simple. Multiple other factors might contribute to the disease, including thromboembolic events such as platelet aggregation, erythrocyte clumping, lipid coalescence, intraosseous vessel compression as a result of extravascular gas bubbles, formation of fibrin thrombi, and narrowing of arterial lumina as a result of myointimal thickening caused by gas bubbles. The interaction between gas and blood can lead to the formation of vessel-occluding substances. All of these events can lead to redistribution of blood flow.",

Exposure to compressed air at pressures of 2.6 to 2.9 atmospheres for 24 hours results in extensive bone and marrow necrosis. The authors proposed that the initial event involving elevated intramedullary pressures leads to the formation of nitrogen gas bubbles in the fatty marrow of the long bones. Radiography shows medullary opacities and endosteal thickening. Later, neovascularization of previously ischemic fatty marrow occurs, followed by new bone formation. Osteonecrosis occurs in subchondral cortical bone with marrow fibrosis and osteocyte loss. 101 Changes in the vasculature through injury or inflammation from other diseases may in turn lead to a compromise in blood flow. Examples include structural damage to arteriolar walls, degeneration of the tunica media, smooth muscle cell necrosis, and disruption of the internal elastic lamina. These changes can lead to eventual hemorrhagic infarction, which was observed in a study of 24 core biopsy specimens from osteonecrotic femoral heads. The changes did not occur in 11 femoral heads affected by osteoarthrosis. 102 Osteoimmunology Although bone marrow is a critical component of the immune system, the bone matrix itself has often been perceived to be merely static scaffolding that functions as a support for the musculoskeletal system. In fact, it is now known that bone matrix is a dynamic tissue that is constantly replacing itself. It is estimated that about 10% of a person's bone is replaced every year. Diseases such as osteopetrosis and osteoporosis are a result of a dysfunction in the balance between bone deposition and bone resorption. The factors that regulate this homeostasis include cells of the bone matrix, immune cells, signaling molecules, cytokines and chemokines, and vitamins and hormones. Some of these regulatory factors may be present on both bone cells and immune cells, often serving different functions, thereby providing a link between the immune system and bone. Osteonecrosis, in fact, may be a result of such an imbalance in bone homeostasis. Immune factors may affect surround-ing soft tissue as well, contributing to the development of osteonecrosis. The study of immune regulation of bone in osteonecrosis encompasses many of the previously proposed mechanisms of osteonecrosis, including apoptosis, oxidative stress, and genetic predisposition.",

Many of these factors can be categorized into one of two categories-those with the overall effect of inducing osteoclastogenesis, and those that inhibit osteoclastogenesis. In addition, factors involved in cell survival and apoptosis such as Blimp-1 and Bcl-6 may also play a role. RANKL is expressed on osteoblasts and is critical for the differentiation and proliferation of osteoclasts. Because transcription of factors involved in the regulation of bone homeostasis is often influenced by glucocorticoids, this mechanism may begin to explain why steroids may be associated with osteonecrosis. The role of the innate immune system has recently come into play as well because investigators reported an upregulation in Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathways in animal models of osteonecrosis, leading to activation of osteoclasts. 103, 104 The action of glucocorticoids is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor, which is present on many cell types, including osteoclasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and cartilage. Binding of glucocorticoids to its receptor leads to the antiinflammatory activity known to be a function of steroids. One mechanism by which this anti-inflammatory effect is mediated is through transcription of genes that inhibit the synthesis of inflammatory mediators.",

During hip replacement surgery, the bone marrow in the proximal head of femurs was isolated in 33 patients with either femoral neck fractures or alcohol-induced osteonecrosis. The cells from femurs of patients with alcohol-induced osteonecrosis showed a reduced ability to differentiate into osteoblasts. 105 A subsequent study compared mesenchymal stem cells from patients with hip osteoarthritis, idiopathic osteonecrosis, and nontraumatic osteonecrosis associated with steroid or alcohol use. In idiopathic and alcoholinduced osteonecrosis, the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts was decreased, but in steroid-induced osteonecrosis, it was elevated, although not to a statistically significant level. The adipogenic differentiation ability was similar in all four groups. 106 In rats fed a diet of alcohol and glucose, lower bone mineral content and density were detected compared with control subjects. In hamsters, alcohol led to thinning of the trabeculae of the distal part of the femur. Cytologic effects included mitochondrial swelling in osteoblasts and",

He proposed that decreased clearance of procoagulants leads to persistent levels of tissue thromboplastin and thus to arteriolar thrombosis, vascular stasis, free fatty acid-induced endothelial damage, and hypercoagulability. Studies have shown that patients with osteonecrosis had a much higher frequency of having at least one or two abnormal coagulant levels compared with normal control subjects. Of patients with osteonecrosis, 82% had at least one and 47% had at least two abnormal procoagulant levels. In normal control subjects, only 30% had one abnormal procoagulant level and only 2.5% had two or more abnormal levels. The procoagulants measured included free protein S, protein C, lipoprotein A, homocysteine, plasminogen activator inhibitor, stimulated tissue plasminogen activator, anti-cardiolipin antibodies (IgM and IgG), and resistance to activated protein C. 116 In addition, both thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis have been associated with osteonecrosis.

            "text": "An association between radiation exposure and osteonecrosis was reported as early as 1950. 124 The earliest reports involved primarily ONJ. Most of the evidence for radiation as a cause of osteonecrosis is derived from case reports. One of the more recent larger studies involved a case-control study to investigate risk factors for ONJ, in which 191 patients with ONJ and 573 control subjects were enrolled from 119 dental practices. The odds ratio for radiation exposure was 24.1 (4.9 to 118.4). However, when patients with cancer were excluded, the association between ONJ and radiation exposure no longer existed as an independent risk factor. 125 Exposure to radiation may result in damage to vascularity of bone and lead to osteonecrosis in a dose-dependent manner. In particular, osteonecrosis after radiation for neoplasms is well documented and particularly affects the femoral head and the mandible. Concomitant administration of chemotherapy can accentuate the risk of osteonecrosis in patients who are receiving radiation, particularly elderly women.",

In this model, high-power acoustic energy up to 1000 W/cm 2 focused directly at bone was able to induce osteonecrosis of the femoral head in a canine model via the creation of a thermal injury. Typical diagnostic ultrasound transducers generally deliver intensities ranging between 0.1 to 100 W/cm 2 , although HIFU has been studied for use in cancer and can reach 100 to 10,000 W/cm 2 . This finding raises the possibility of ultrasoundinduced osteonecrosis in humans in real-life clinical settings, although this possibility is far from substantiated. 126 The proposed mechanism by which ultrasound can induce osteonecrosis is through thermal damage induced by osteocyte damage and vascular thrombosis.",

Accompanying the upregulation of microRNA-210 in patients with osteonecrosis were also increased expression of VEGF and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -7 when compared with patients who had osteoarthritis. 150 Other microRNAs such as microRNA-29a and microRNA-548d-5p have also been shown to play a role in regulation of bone resorption and osteogenesis. 151, 152 MicroRNA-17-5p, which is known to play a role in cancer cell proliferation and invasion, was evaluated to test whether it also plays a role in osteoblast differentiation. The investigators found that expression of this microRNA was lower in patients who had osteonecrosis compared with patients who had osteoarthritis. This finding was accompanied by a facilitation in the differentiation of HMSC-bm cells, which is thought to be mediated by the action of microRNA-17-5p on expression of \u03b2-catenin and a subsequent increase in COL1A1. 153 MicroRNA profiles identified 27 microRNAs that were differentially expressed in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Fifteen were overexpressed, and 12 were underexpressed in patients with osteonecrosis when compared with either patients who had systemic lupus erythematosus or healthy control subjects. 154 The differentiating nature of microRNA profiles may play a future role as disease biomarkers.",

Treatment with dexamethasone plus the recombinant adenovirus shuttle vector led to amelioration of the marrow necrosis, adipocyte hypertrophy and proliferation, diminished hematopoiesis, thinner and sparse trabeculae, and an increased number of empty osteocyte lacunae in the femoral head seen in rabbits that only received dexamethasone or in combination with an irrelevant shuttle vector. 155 These studies, although in their early stages, offer hope for novel treatments based on pathogenesis and the physiologic and cellular derangements that are risk factors for the development of osteonecrosis.",

It has been argued that eNOS is an important player in the development of osteonecrosis. Nitric oxide may have beneficial effects on three systems involved in osteonecrosis-namely skeletal, vascular, and thrombotic. Each of these systems may be targets for proposed mechanisms of pathogenesis of osteonecrosis. A comparative analysis of the 26-base pair repeat polymorphism in intron 4 and the Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 of the eNOS gene in patients with idiopathic, steroid-induced, and alcohol-induced osteonecrosis and normal control subjects was performed. 141 The frequency of the homozygous 4a allele was found to be higher in patients with idiopathic osteonecrosis compared with control subjects. The frequency of the 4a/b allele was found to be higher in all types of osteonecrosis when compared with control subjects.

Later, radiographs will begin to show sclerotic changes PART 15",

A bone scan could be an excellent screening tool for the diagnosis of osteonecrosis before further characterization of the lesions using CT or MRI. 159 CT allows more detailed examination of the femoral head. A star-shaped structure, formed by weight-bearing bone trabeculae, gives the appearance of an asterisk on a CT scan (the asterisk sign).

The use of this technique in the early diagnosis of this condition depends on the increase of osteoblastic activity and blood flow in the early stages of osteonecrosis. In an advanced stage of disease, the appearance may be one of increased activity in a subchondral distribution as a result of osteoblastic activity at the reactive interface around the necrotic segment; however, the center of the osteonecrotic lesion may show much less radionuclide uptake (Figure 103-6) or even a complete lack of activity, reflecting decreased metabolism in the necrotic focus as a result of interruption of the blood supply. 7 Decreased signal on T1-and T2-weighted images in most cases the necrotic area is composed of a variety of tissue, including areas of fibrosis and necrosis mixed with areas of blood and edema, depending on the age of the infarct. Therefore the MRI signal of the necrotic area is often very heterogeneous (see Figure 103 -8), and as a result, this classification is of little clinical value. The low signal intensity band in the periphery of the osteonecrotic area correlates with a sclerotic band seen on radiographs and CT and often has a serpiginous appearance. When the osteonecrosis involves a long bone, this serpiginous band or line has been termed \"smoke in a chimney.\" MRI is an important tool in determining the extent of femoral head involvement in osteonecrosis. Three techniques are used to evaluate the extent of this involvement. The first is estimating head involvement. This method was first proposed by Steinberg and colleagues 163 in 1984, and it is defined by the appearance of abnormal signals on T1-weighted images. The degree of head involvement was classified into three categories: less than 15%, 15% to 30%, and greater than 30%. The second method used to evaluate the extent of involvement is the index of necrotic extent, which is determined by measuring the angle created by the extent of subchondral involvement. Lesion size was estimated using a \"necrotic arc angle,\" defined by the angle of",

This approach adds little risk compared with unilateral core decompression, with the benefit of better outcomes as a result of early surgical treatment of the contralateral hip. 167 In structural bone grafting, or bone impaction grafting, the bone graft is inserted into the necrotic segment through the core tract.

Conservative medical treatment is effective only in the early stages for symptomatic relief. Nonsurgical management does not seem to alter the natural course of the disease. Electrical stimulation has been used in the treatment of osteonecrosis, in conjunction with core decompression. Electrical stimulation enhances osteogenesis and neovascularization. It also alters the balance between osteoblast and osteoclast activity, resulting in increased bone deposition and decreased bone resorption. Delivery of electrical stimulation can be performed by direct current (DC), pulsed electromagnetic field, and capacitance coupling. The success of electrical stimulation in the treatment of osteonecrosis has been rather mediocre. A study was performed of 11 hips in 8 patients with Ficat stage 2 osteonecrosis who underwent core decompression and placement of an electric stimulating coil within the core in the anterosuperior segment of the femoral head. 183 Of these 11 hips, 5 required a repeat operation, and 6 had progressive deterioration 13 months after initial placement of the coil. In addition, there was little histologic evidence that the coil did indeed hips required conversion to total hip arthroplasty because of collapse, severe pain, or both. Of the remaining 212 hips, 92% were considered a clinical success and 76% were considered radiographically successful. The success rate declined from stage 2 to stage 4 hips (96% for stage 2 hips, 90% for stage 3 hips, and 57% for stage 4 hips). 171 Free vascularized fibula grafting has been compared favorably with other modes of surgical treatment. 172 Osteotomy of the femur involves shifting the position of the osteonecrotic segment by making a cut in the proximal femur so that the osteonecrotic segment is rotated or flexed out of the weight-bearing region of the acetabulum and then replacing the weight-bearing region with viable bone. Healing of the necrotic region can proceed without the stress of weight bearing. Several different osteotomy techniques have been attempted to salvage hips with stage 2 or 3 osteonecrosis.",

The potential advantages of resurfacing arthroplasty include preservation of joint mechanics, bone conservation, 173 more physiologic loading of the bone, a lower incidence of perioperative complications, and easier conversion to total hip arthroplasty in case of failure. 174 Complications of this procedure include femoral neck fractures, a secondary osteonecrosis when the procedure is performed for other reasons, 175 and increased metal ion levels. 176 Resurfacing arthroplasty has been recommended for patients with later-stage osteonecrosis, including those with femoral head collapse. 177 A retrospective study compared the results of limited femoral head resurfacing and total hip arthroplasty in 30 consecutive patients with Steinberg stage 3 or 4 disease. The survival rate at a 7-year mean follow-up period for the resurfacing group was 90%, whereas the survival rate at a mean 8-year follow-up for the total hip arthroplasty group was 93%. 178 A recent level 3 therapeutic study showed that hip resurfacing success rates at a 5-year follow-up were comparable with those of total hip arthroplasty in patients with osteonecrosis who were younger than 25 years. 179 In hemiarthroplasty, only part of the hip joint is replaced. The original acetabulum is preserved, but the femoral head is replaced with a prosthesis. Two types of prostheses are used-a unipolar prosthesis and a bipolar prosthesis. In a unipolar prosthesis, the articulation is between the artificial femoral head and the acetabulum. In the bipolar prosthesis (presently the most frequently used), the articulation is within the prosthesis itself. Failure rates for hemiarthroplasties in individuals with osteonecrosis are 50% to 60% at 3 years for unipolar prostheses and 44% for bipolar prostheses. Another study evaluated the success rate of Charnley/ Bicentric hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of Ficat and Arlet stage 3 osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Failures included three hips that needed to be revised to cementless total hip replacement, two hips with radiographic changes of loosening and imminent failure, and one hip with progressive loss of joint space and secondary degenerative changes.

This finding suggests that oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis and that a role may exist for antioxidants such as vitamin E. 187 A group of researchers studied the use of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in rabbits to prevent corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis and found that if ACTH is administered along with depot methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol), osteonecrosis is reduced. The authors of this study believe that ACTH enhances osteoblast support and stimulates the production of VEGF, which stimulates the generation of new blood vessels. The result is an increase in blood flow to the vulnerable areas of bone, preventing cell death and reducing the likelihood of osteonecrosis. 188 ",
