The derivatised sensor chips were washed and equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7\u00b74, 20 L/min), and the peptides to be tested were introduced at five serial dilutions in running buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7\u00b74, and 0\u00b7005% P20) in 200 L injection volumes and at a flow rate of 20 L/min. conformation via HR1 and HR2 interaction to form a fusogenic hexameric core structure, which brings the viral and target-cell membranes into close proximity, resulting in fusion between them. At the intermediate state, a C-peptide can bind the viral gp41 HR1 region and block formation of the SIX-HELIX BUNDLE, thus inhibiting virus fusion with the target cell. 20 The discovery of these HIV-1 fusion-inhibitory peptides launched a new line of investigation of viral fusogenic mechanisms and identification of antiviral peptides against infection by many other enveloped viruses-simian 21 and feline 22 immunodeficiency viruses, Ebola virus, 23 Newcastle disease virus, 24 and respiratory syncytial virus. 25 Similarly to HIV-1 gp41, the S2 domain of SARS-CoV spike protein contains HR1 and HR2 sequences, which tend to form a coiled-coil structure (figure 1). The association, followed by 15 min of dissociation. The sensogram response data were analysed by commercial software (BIA-Evaluation version 3.1), and the kinetic dissociation constant was calculated. Each experiment was done at least three times. The secondary structure of the peptides was determined by circular-dichroism spectroscopy as previously described. 27 The isolated peptides or peptide mixtures were diluted in phosphate buffer (50 mmol/L sodium phosphate, pH 7\u00b72) at the final concentration of 10 mol/L, and the circular-dichroism spectra were acquired on a spectropolarimeter (Model J-715, Jasco Inc, Japan) at 4\u00b0C with a bandwidth of 5\u00b70 nm, resolution 0\u00b71 nm, path length 0\u00b71 cm, response time 4\u00b70 s, and scanning speed 50 nm/min. Thermal denaturation was monitored at 222 nm by application of a thermal gradient of 5\u00b0C/min. The spectra were corrected by the subtraction of a blank corresponding to the solvent. The melting curve was smoothed and the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (Tm) values was calculated with Jasco software utilities as previously described. 28 The apparent molecular masses of the peptides and peptide mixtures were measured by SEDIMENTATION EQUILIBRIUM analysis on a Beckman Coulter Optima XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge equipped with a real-time video-based data-acquisition system and Rayleigh optics. The peptides were run at three initial concentrations (250 mol/L, 500 mol/L, and 1000 mol/L) in 10 mmol/L sodium phosphate, pH 7\u00b72, containing 150 mmol/L sodium chloride and 5 mmol/L tris(2carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride. Sample volumes of 110 L were used in six-sector cells equipped with quartz windows. All experiments were done at 25\u00b0C, and sedimentation equilibrium data were collected at 48 000 rpm (167 731\u03ebg) for NP-1, 35 000 rpm (89 180\u03ebg) for CP-1, and 25 000 rpm (45 500\u03ebg) for CP-1/NP-1 complex. Sedimentation equilibrium profiles were edited by the program REEDIT (Jeff Lary, National Analytical Ultracentrifuge Center, Storrs, CT, USA) and analysed by a non-linear, least-squares method with the program WINNONLIN. 29 The values of the partial specific volumes for the peptides were calculated from the aminoacid composition with the program SEDNTERP (David Hayes, Magdalen College, Oxford, UK; Tom Laue, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA; John Philo, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA).",

This analysis showed about 45-50% sequence similarity (figure 1). We used the X-ray crystal structure of the gp41 core structure (pdb code 1env) to build a model of interaction between the SARS-CoV NP-1 and CP-1 peptides as described below. We aligned HIV-1 N-peptide N36 and SARS-CoV N-peptide NP-1, and HIV-1 C-peptide C43 and SARS-CoV Cpeptide CP-1 by use of the program ClustalX. 32 Any insertions and deletions were manually adjusted to avoid gaps in the helix regions. Homology models of each peptide were built by the automated software 1-1199) , a transmembrane domain (residues 1200-1215), and an intracellular domain (residues 1216-1255). A signal peptide (residues 1-13) at the amino-terminus was observed, but no obvious fusogenic peptide sequence was identified. The spike proteins of most coronaviruses (except porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus) are cleavable by cellular proteases to yield S1 (receptor binding) and S2 (virus fusion) subunits. 9,10,12,38 SARS-CoV spike protein does not contain a typical cleavage site (a basic aminoacid sequence-eg, RRFRR, GRHRR, KRRSRR). 9 Therefore, the boundary between the S1 and S2 domains cannot be accurately identified at present. As in other coronavirus spike proteins, the S2 domain has a more conserved sequence than the S1 domain. The latter is a compact globular structure as predicted by the PredictProtein program Globe for prediction of globularity. The S2 domain contains HR1 (residues 892-1013) and HR2 (residues 1145-1194), similar to other class I viral fusion proteins. 9, 13, 39 Analysis by the MultiCoil program 31 showed that the sequences in the HR1 and HR2 regions have a tendency to form trimeric or dimeric helix bundles, consistent with the observation that coronavirus spike proteins are homotrimers or homodimers. 9 Thus, these regions may take part in the oligomerisation and conformational changes of spike protein during virus-cell fusion events. The spike protein of SARS-CoV has only about 24% pairwise aminoacid identity with the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses, consistent with the observation by Rota and colleagues. 6 However, the identity of their HR1 and HR2 sequences is much higher (table 2), which suggests that the sequences in the HR1 and HR2 regions are more conserved than other sequences in spike protein. Alignments of the peptides derived from the HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV spike protein and the HIV-1 gp41 revealed high sequence similarity between HIV-1 N-peptide N36 and SARS-CoV N-peptide NP-1 and between HIV-1 C-peptide C43 and SARS-CoV C-peptide CP-1 (45% and 51%, respectively; figure 1 ). Thus, the HR1 and HR2 regions in SARS-CoV spike protein and HIV-1 gp41 may share certain structural and functional features.",

To identify the CP-1 binding site in HR1, we immobilised biotinylated CP-1 on streptavidin sensor chips and searched for the CP-1binding peptides from HR1 region, as determined by surface plasmon resonance with BIACORE. CP-1 strongly bound to NP-1 with a high binding affinity or kinetic dissociation constant (1\u00b762\u03eb10 -8 mol/L; figure 2 ), whereas other peptides derived from the HR1 region had very low or no binding activity to CP-1 (data not shown). CP-2, which has a ten-residue shift towards the C-terminus of CP-1 ( figure 1; table 1 ), did not bind to NP-1, which suggests that the N-terminal residues of CP-1 are important for the interaction between NP-1 and CP-1 or that the C-terminal residues in CP-2 interfere with binding between NP-1 and CP-1. Circular-dichroism spectroscopic analysis showed that the peptide CP-1 had a low content of \u2423-helicity (with minima at 208 nm and 222 nm) in phosphate buffer We have previously shown by N-PAGE that the HIV-1 gp41 peptides N36 and C34 can interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle. 30 By a similar approach, we investigated whether CP-1 also forms an oligomeric complex with peptides derived from the HR1 region. With the exception of NP-3, N-peptides showed no bands in the gel (figure 4) because they carried net positive charges under the native electrophoresis conditions (table 1) and could therefore have migrated up and off the gel. NP-3 did migrate down in the gel because it has net zero charge, but it showed two bands, perhaps because it has differing conformations. Peptide CP-1 showed a band in the lower part of the gel. The mixture of NP-1 and CP-1 showed two bands: the lower one had the same position as isolated CP-1, and the upper one is expected to be a higher order of oligomeric complex formed by NP-1 and CP-1. To confirm whether this band indeed represents a complex formed between NP-1 and CP-1, we analysed the mixture of NP-1 and biotinylated CP-1 at different ratios by N-PAGE in two gels. One was stained with Coomassie blue ( figure 4, middle gel) . The peptides and their complex in another gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was stained with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and its substrate ( figure 4, lower gel) . With increasing concentrations of NP-1, the intensity of upper bands increased and that of the lower bands decreased, which suggests that formation of the upper band depends on the concentration of NP-1 and confirms that the band does not represent aggregates of CP-1.",

            "text": "Since the migration speed of a molecule or a complex in N-PAGE depends on both the size and the net charge of the molecule or complex, this method cannot be used to measure exactly the molecular mass of NP-1/CP-1 complex in the gel or to find out whether the lower band of CP-1 is monomer or oligomer. Therefore, we analysed the apparent molecular masses of the peptides NP-1, CP-1, and NP-1/CP-1 complex by sedimentation equilibration, which was successfully used to find out the mass of the six-helix bundle formed by the HIV-1 gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides. 17 The isolated NP-1 was a monomer and the molecular mass obtained for CP-1 corresponded to a trimer in phosphate-buffered saline (table 3). The HPLC-purified mixture of NP-1 and CP-1 showed a complex with a molecular mass of about 24 781 Da (figure 5), which was close to the calculated molecular mass of a trimer of dimers. These results were confirmed by SE-HPLC; NP-1 showed a single peak of monomer and CP-1 a major peak corresponding to a trimer, whereas the mixture of NP-1 and CP-1 showed three peaks corresponding to NP-1 monomer, CP-1 trimer, and NP-1/CP-1 trimer of heterodimer (hexamer) ( figure 6 ). These findings suggest that NP-1 is a monomeric structure and that CP-1 has a trimeric conformation in phosphate-buffered saline. Once they are mixed at equimolar concentration, they interact to form a six-helix bundle consisting of three molecules of NP-1 and three of CP-1. This notion is consistent with the biophysical properties of the HIV-1 gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides as shown by sedimentation equilibration and SE-HPLC. 17, 30, 41 Alignments of the NP-1 and CP-1 peptides on the corresponding HIV-1 gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides revealed reasonable sequence similarities and gave us confidence that a homology model of NP-1 and CP-1 association could be built on the basis of the X-ray crystal structure of the HIV-1 gp41 core formed by the gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides. 18, 19 NP-1 showed a typical coiled-coil structure (figure 7). Most of CP-1 had an \u2423-helical conformation with the exception of a kink in the middle of the structure. The structure of the possible complex between these two peptides was then investigated by use of specialised protein-docking software. 35 The residues at the \"a\" and \"d\" positions in the NP-1 and CP-1 are hydrophobic. The complex structure formed by the docking technique also shows that there are hydrophobic interactions between these two peptides: eg, L898, I905, F909, I913, and I916 of NP-1 interact very well with L1182, V1171, L1168, I1165, and I1161 of CP-1, respectively. Owing to the lack of crystal coordinates of the sequence beyond the N-terminus of the HIV-1 gp41 peptide C34, 18 the corresponding N-terminal sequence (residues 1153-1159) of CP-1 could not be modelled and its interaction with the corresponding region in the C-terminus of NP-1 could not be predicted.",

The biophysical studies showed that the peptides derived from these regions of SARS-CoV spike proteins have similar properties to those derived from the HIV-1 gp41 HR1 and HR2 regions, respectively. For example, like the HIV-1 gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides, NP-1 and CP-1 from SARS-CoV can interact to form highorder oligomeric helices, which may have important roles in the fusion of SARS-CoV with target cells. On the basis of results from this study and knowledge about HIV-1 gp41 and other viral transmembrane proteins, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] we propose a model to elucidate the fusogenic mechanism mediated by SARS-CoV spike protein and the mechanism by which CP-1 inhibits SARS-CoV infection (figure 8). In the native state, spike proteins on the virus surface could be in oligomeric form through the self-association of their partly helical HR2 regions to form the stems of the spikes on SARS-CoV; HR1 regions may be in random coil conformation covered by S1 domain. After the binding of the S1 domain to a receptor (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) 7 on the target cell (receptor-binding state), the S2 domain changes conformation by forming \u2423-helices, extending and inserting its inert fusion peptide into the target-cell membrane, and exposing HR1 and HR2 regions (intermediate pre-hairpin state). Then the HR1s form a trimer and the HR2 trimer dissociates to monomers. Subsequently, the HR2 monomers pack onto the grooves of the HR1 trimer to form the six-helix bundle. This fusion-active core structure brings the viral and target-cell membranes into close proximity, resulting in fusion between the membranes and formation of fusion pores, which allow the virus genome to enter the target cell. If a C-peptide, such as CP-1, is present in the intermediate state, it could bind to the HR1 region and block hexamer formation, thereby inhibiting fusion. However, more direct evidence is needed to validate this model. Nevertheless, the information obtained from other coronaviruses can provide indirect evidence to support the hypothesis.",

            "text": "Double alanine substitutions of the four middle heptadic leucine and isoleucine residues within the HR2 region lead to significant reduction in fusion activity and defects in spike oligomerisation. Bosch and co-workers 43 reported the structural and functional characterisation of the fusion core complex formed by the HR1 and HR2 regions of the murine hepatitis virus spike protein. Although our group and theirs have worked independently on distinct coronaviruses by different approaches, we have obtained surprisingly similar results. First, only peptides derived from the HR2 region, not the HR1 region, have antiviral activity. Second, HR2 peptides derived from both murine hepatitis virus and SARS-CoV spike proteins have antiviral activity in the micromolar range. Third, the fragments involving the interaction between the HR1 and HR2 in spike proteins of both viruses are located in the same regions. These findings suggest that murine hepatitis virus and SARS-CoV have a common fusogenic mechanism, which may be shared by other coronaviruses. The peptides derived from the HR2 regions of the SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus spike proteins have much less potent inhibitory activity than HIV-1 gp41 C-peptides (eg, C34 and T-20), which have activity in the nanomolar range. 16, 44 SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus may therefore have a fusogenic mechanism different from that of HIV-1. However, the peptides derived from the HR2 regions of many other enveloped viruses, including Ebola virus, 23 Newcastle disease virus, 24 parainfluenza virus, 45 and respiratory syncytial virus, 25 inhibit the corresponding virus infection also in the micromolar range, and these viruses have similar fusogenic mechanisms to HIV-1. 23 Two major factors can affect the potency of a fusioninhibitory peptide: the sensitivity of a virus to the corresponding antiviral peptides; and the sequence and conformation of the inhibitory peptide. The sensitivity of HIV-1 to the fusion-inhibitory peptide T-20 correlates with fusion kinetics, envelope/coreceptor affinity, and receptor density. 46 Figure 8 : Illustration of the conformational changes of SARS-CoV spike protein during the process of fusion between the virus and target-cell membranes",

Use of such peptides for treatment of SARS is better than application of anti-HIV peptides for chemotherapy of AIDS because only a few doses should be needed to treat an individual with acute SARS-CoV infection (no chronic SARS has been reported), whereas an HIV-infected individual might have to use T-20, one of the most expensive anti-HIV drugs, for life. Furthermore, the anti-SARS-CoV peptides might also be used prophylactically as nasal spray or inhalation formulations to protect at-risk populations working and travelling in SARS-endemic areas. The peptides derived from the HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV spike protein could be used to establish high-throughput assays for screening non-peptidic SARS-CoV fusion inhibitors; we have successfully developed several such assays with the HIV-1 gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides for identification of small-molecule HIV-1 fusion inhibitors. 20, 49, 50 Any compounds that block the HR1-HR2 interaction could be used as leads for development of virus fusion inhibitors.

Cerebral MRI showed a ring-enhancing left parietal lobe abscess with adjacent vasogenic oedema and a large loculated left subdural empyema with mass effect (figure). We drained the intracerebral and subdural abscessses, and cultured S typhimurium from the aspirate. The patient was treated with high dose intravenous ceftriaxone, but died 6 weeks after admission. This abscess may have been caused by haematogenous dissemination of S typhimurium following banding of the patient's oesphageal varices.",
