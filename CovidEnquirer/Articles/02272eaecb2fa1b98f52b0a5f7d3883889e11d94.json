Cell lysis occurred 24 h post-infection and was shown by a decreased neutral red uptake. UV inactivation of the influenza virus, or the addition of anti-influenza antibodies suppressed the virus-induced macrophage lysis. Inversely, pretreatment of swine alveolar macrophages by a phagocytosis inhibitor, namely cytochalasin B, increased the cell susceptibility to virus-induced lysis.",

In the course of an influenza infec-tion, secondary bacterial pneumonias are often described and are partly explained by impaired functions of the alveolar macrophages; thus, influenzavirus-infected mice showed a reduced rate of inactivation of inhaled bacteria I331 as well as altered alveolar maerophage activities [27, 13] . Quite similar results were obtained with Sendai (parainfluenza 1) virus infection in mice [8, 23, 32] . Most in vitro studies have also shown that the influenza virus was able to play direct toxic and antiphagocytic roles on blood leukoeytes |28, 20, 14, 4 ] and on human [31] as well as mouse alveolar macrophages [15, 19] . In alveolar maerophages, the influenza virus replication cycle was found to be abortive [31, 15, 17, 19] .",

            "text": "In the present report, we show that the influenza virus induces SAM lysis in vitro : this lyric effect is shown (24 h post-infection) by a decreased neutral red uptake by infected cells as compared to control cells, an increased percentage of eosin-stained cells and a cell detachment from plastic surfaces. We have previously shown that this lysis was due to the virus particle [5] : presently, it appears that UV-inactivated virus suspension is no longer toxic for SAM; furthermore, no viral haemagglutinin or interferon is detectable in infected SAM supernatants (unpnblished results). Thus the data indicate that the virus-induced SAM lysis requires a virus infection, but without the production of haemagglutinin by infected cells. These results, obtained with porcine macrophages, are consistent with most studies performed with human or rodent alveolar macrophages. Voisin el al. [31] described that the influenza virus ~B Lee strain) was phagocytosed by human alveolar macrophages in vitro and induced cell death without virus production. With rodent alveolar macrophages, Lemercier et al. [15] showed that infected cells (with the A/PR8 strain) detached from the plastic surface and exhibited decreased phagocytic capacities. By virus titration, electron microscopy and immunofluorescence, the virus cycle was found to be abortive, with the appearance of viral antigens in infected cells but lack of virus production [15, 17, 19] . Interestingly, Rodgers and Mims [19] observed that mouse peritoneal macrophages were much less susceptible to influenza virus than alveolar macrophages; however, alveolar and peritoneal macrophages were equally restrictive to mouse cytomegalovirus. Interactions between viruses and macrophages differ widely, therefore, according to the virus considered and the anatomical source of the macrophages. In this respect, we observed that although swine influenza virus does not replicate completely in SAM, another virus, namely the porcine coronavirus TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus), does multiply in SAM, inducing cell lysis and interferon production (Laude and Charley, in press). Virus-macrophage interactions can be modified by immune responses [27, 16, 18] : in the case of vaccinia virus, for example, virus uptake by macrophages is enhanced by antibodies, and the neutralized virions are sequestered within lysosomes, where they are degraded [22] . From the present data, it appears that antibodies suppress the SAM lysis by influenza virus: this could mean either that antibodies neutralize extracellular virus particles, or that they opsonize the virus and stimulate its phagocytosis. Since specific antibodies have been shown to enhance influenza virus phagocytosis by human blood leukocytes [3] , our results could imply that enhancement of virus phagocytosis could decrease SAM lysis. In order to check this hypothesis, we pretreated SAM with cytochalasin B, a drug which interferes with the microfilament cell functions and decreases phagocytosis [2, 24] . Cytochalasin B was shown to increase the number of glass-adherent rabbit alveolar macrophages [26] , and this would explain why the neutral red uptake was increased in our SAM-pretreated cultures. Furthermore, the latter result shows that cytochalasin B by itself is not toxic for SAM. In our experiments, cytochalasin B slightly decreased L. monocytogenes phagocytosis by SAM and reduced neutral red uptake by infected SAM: since cytochalasin B alone did not decrease neutral red uptake, these results suggest that cytochalasin B simultaneously reduced phagocytosis and increased SAM susceptibility to the virus lyric effect. It is therefore proposed that the influenza virus toxic effect could depend upon SAM phagocytic capacities. It has been claimed that the influenza virus is able to penetrate into the cytoplasm through the phagosomes [7] . However, antibodies which promote virus ingestion by macrophages [3, 16] could induce the phago-lysosome fusion so that virus degradation could occur, as reviewed by Elsbach [9] : this would explain why, in our experiments, antibody-virus complexes did not lyse SAM. In the same way, the virus-induced cell lysis appears to be a cytochalasin-B-sensitive phenomenon and therefore related to microfilament cell functions.",
