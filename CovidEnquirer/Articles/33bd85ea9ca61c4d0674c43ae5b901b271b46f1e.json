At the same time, we see non-China deaths increasing rapidly, and similar to the early behavior of the China statistics. Thus, we see three stages of the spread of the disease in terms of number of deaths: exponential growth, power-law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate.",

The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models. Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.",

Both cases and deaths continue to grow at an alarming rate. In standard epidemiological analysis, one assumes that the number of cases in diseases like this one grows exponentially, based upon the idea of a fixed reproduction rate. If each person infects n other people where n > 1 (the reproduction number), then the total number of cases should grow as n t/\u03c4 = e at , where \u03c4 is the incubation time, which depends on the characteristics of the particular disease. Several studies of have taken this approach to model the number of cases [e.g., .

The results imply that this network has an effective minimum path fractal dimension of 2.25. The implication is that the disease produces flares in which the growth is momentarily exponential, but then slows down until another flare-up. The averaged effect of this growth apparently yields a power-law. suggest that if the pandemic spreads into new cities, exponential growth like what happened in Wuhan in the early stages would occur. Hopefully, if this were the case, it would be quickly stopped and slower behavior would ensue. But our prediction of approximately 13,350 deaths by March 27 relies on the assumption that a new major outbreak will not happen. Hermanowicz [2020] and Roosa et al. [2020] have recently modeled the disease using a logistical and other growth models. These models are able to predict the ultimate number of cases, and find results in the range of 20,000 to 60,000. We believe the numbers will be much greater, and expect a number of deaths in this range, if the fractal growth continues as it has for a few more months.",

This mirrors our process of testing this model as more data were published on the number of deaths. The coefficient is stable. The confidence intervals are calculated analogously to those in Fig. 6 .
