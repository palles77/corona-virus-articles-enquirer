RIG-I efficiently bound to HCV poly U/UC and poly (I:C) and weakly to the WNV 5'UTR with a 5'ppp. Addition of a 2'O methyl group to the Cap 0 structure did not change RIG-I binding to the WNV 5'UTR RNA.

At the indicated time points cells were harvested, mRNA was isolated, and levels of IFIT-2 mRNA were quantitated using TaqMan primers and probes after normalizing to levels of 18S ribosomal RNA.

Two days later, cells were infected with WNV-WT or WNV-E218A, and 24 hours later cells were processed for relative infection by flow cytometry using a MAb against WNV E protein. a. Summary of the effect of individual Hu-IFIT genes on WNV-WT or WNV-E218A. Infectivity as judged by flow cytometry (b) was normalized to the vector only plasmid. Data is the average of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. As the transfection efficiency was ~50%, (judged by parallel experiments with a GFP expression plasmid (data not shown)), the maximum expected reduction in infectivity for any of the human IFIT transgenes was 50%, this explaining the only partial inhibitory effect. b. Representative histograms of transfected cells infected with WNV-WT or WNV-E218A. The absolute percentage of WNV-infected cells is indicated in the top right corner of each histogram. The red arrow shows an example of selective inhibition of WNV-E218A by Hu-IFIT-5. c. Western blot of different Hu-IFIT genes after transient transfection of 293T cells.

The full-length cDNA encoding for recombinant MHV-A59 was cloned into the vaccinia virus vNotI/tk and the corresponding recombinant vaccinia virus, designated vMHVinf-1, was modified by two rounds of vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination using the E.coli guanosin-phosphoribosyltransferase (gpt) as a selection marker 2 . Initially, vMHV-inf-1 was recombined with plasmid pGPT-nsp16 (based on the plasmid pGPT-1 3 ) that contains the MHV nucleotides (nts) 20313-20816, the gpt gene, and MHV nts 21773-22274. The resulting recombinant vaccinia virus vMHV-gpt-nsp16, encoding for the MHV-A59 cDNA with the nsp16-encoding region replaced by the gpt gene, was obtained afer three rounds of plaque purification under gpt-positive selection 2 . The second recombination was performed with vMHV-gpt-nsp16 and the plasmid pD130A that encodes MHV nts 20665-21925 with the nucleotide substitution GAT to GCA at positions 21234 to 21236 to modify the active site (D130A) 4 of the MHV-A59 2'O-MT. The resulting recombinant vaccinia virus vMHV-D130A also was obtained after three rounds of plaque purification under gpt-negative selection. To generate the recombinant MHV-D130A, the vaccinia virus vMHV-D130A genomic DNA was purified, cleaved with the restriction enzyme EagI, and used for an T7-RNA polymerasemediated in vitro transcription reaction. The resulting RNA was transfected into BHK-N cells 2 and produced recombinant MHV-D130A in the cell culture supernatant. The identity of MHV-D130A was confirmed by RT-PCR of viral RNA and sequencing analysis.",
