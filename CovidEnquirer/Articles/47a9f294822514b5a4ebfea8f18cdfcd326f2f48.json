Previously, we showed that the cellular factor TNF-\u2423 converting enzyme (TACE), activated by the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S protein), was positively involved in viral entry, implying that TACE is a possible target for developing antiviral compounds. To demonstrate this possibility, we here tested the effects of TACE inhibitors on viral entry. In vitro and in vivo data revealed that the TACE inhibitor TAPI-2 attenuated entry of both pseudotyped virus expressing the SARS-S protein in a lentiviral vector backbone and infectious SARS-CoV. TAPI-2 blocked both the SARS-S protein-induced shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV, and TNF-\u2423 production in lung tissues. Since the downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-S protein was proposed as an etiological event in the severe clinical manifestations, our data suggest that TACE antagonists block SARS-CoV infection and also attenuate its severe clinical outcome.",

About 8000 individuals were infected and the mortality rate was 10% (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . In 2003, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a cellular receptor of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003) , and the binding of SARS-CoV spike protein (SARS-S protein) and ACE2 was clearly shown to be a required initial step for viral entry (Li et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2004) . Based on an analysis of the molecular interaction between ACE2 and SARS-S protein and the subsequent process of viral entry (Kuhn et al., 2007) , several targets are now available for developing antiviral compounds (Liu et al., 2004; Simmons et al., 2005; Sui et al., 2004) . Since recurrent outbreaks of SARS-CoV can reemerge, developing compounds that will prevent SARS-CoV are critically important.",

TACE-dependent shedding of ACE2 is completely dependent on the binding of SARS-S protein to ACE2 (Haga et al., 2008) . In addition, siRNA experiments demonstrated that TACE was required for efficient viral entry (Haga et al., 2008) , implying that TACE might be a target for antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV. Since the downregulation of ACE2 caused by the SARS-S protein was postulated as being correlated with the severe respiratory failure (Kuba et al., 2005) , TACE inhibitors might also attenuate the tissue damage caused by the viral infection. Therefore, we analyzed the antiviral activities of TAPI-0 and TAPI-2, hydroxamate-based TACE inhibitors (Mohler et al., 1994; Black et al., 1997) .",

Western blot analysis detected the shed form of the ACE2 ectodomain, which was about 80 kDa in size, in culture supernatants after treatment with the SARS-S protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-3) . When cells were pretreated with 100 nM TAPI-0 (Fig. 1A , lanes 4 and 5) or 200 nM TAPI-2 (lanes 6 and 7) for 1 h, the SARS-S-induced ACE2 shedding was attenuated significantly. Since a soluble form of ACE2 released from the cell (Haga et al., 2008) was added for 3 and 6 h. The proteins present in the culture supernatants were recovered by coprecipitation with ovalbumin (OVA) in trichloroacetic acid, and subjected to Western blot analysis, as previously described (Haga et al., 2008) . Lane 1, control without the addition of SARS-S protein; lanes 2 and 3, saline with SARS-S protein; lanes 4 and 5, TAPI-0 with SARS-S protein; lanes 6 and 7, TAPI-2 with SARS-S protein. The culture supernatants were collected after 3 h (lanes 2, 4 and 6) or 6 h (lanes 3, 5 and 7). (B and C) TAPI-0 inhibits the release of ACE2 activity into the culture supernatants. The ACE2 activity was measured in the supernatants of Vero E6 cells cultured with or without 100 nM TAPI-0. The horizontal axis shows the incubation time of a fluorescence substrate of ACE2 (Mca-Y-V-A-D-A-P-K-Dnp-OH, amino acid depicted by single letters; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (B). The relative rate of inhibition calculated based on the data shown in (B) at 90 min (C). (D and E) TAPI-2 inhibits the release of ACE2 activity into the culture supernatants.

The cells were treated with TAPI-0 (A) or TAPI-2 (B) for 1 h and then infected with the SARS-S pseudotyped lentivirus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 4 h. The intracellular p24 was measured using a Retro-Tek HIV-1 p24 ELISA kit (ZeptoMetrix, Buffalo, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. (C) TAPI-2 blocked the entry of infectious SARS-CoV. The viral infection efficiency was measured using real-time RT-PCR of viral mRNA, as described (Haga et al., 2008) . Test samples were harvested and analyzed 4 h after infection with SARS-CoV. The data were normalized using 18S ribosomal RNA. In this experiment, TAPI-2 was used because TAPI-2 is water soluble, whereas TAPI-0 is water insoluble. TAPI-2 did not require control samples treated with of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), a solvent of TAPI-0. (Fig. 3C) in vitro, its inhibitory effect was not drastic in vivo (Fig. 4C) . As one possible explanation, TACE might not be a single target for complete suppression of viral infection. Work done by independent research groups has shown that SARS-CoV uses DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin) and L (liver/lymph node-specific)-SIGN (DC/L-SIGN) as additional cellular receptors (Han et al., 2007; Jeffers et al., 2004; Shih et al., 2006) . It was further proposed that the mode of the viral entry via these molecules was different from that of ACE2 (Han et al., 2007) . These observations lend support to the notion that the combined administration of antagonists against TACE and DC/L-SIGN would lead to more remarkable inhibition on the viral infection of SARS-CoV. Another possibility is that complete blockage of virus entry might be required for efficient suppression of viral production. It seems that viral replication of SARS-CoV more crucially determines the whole To test the effects of TAPI-0, 25 l of 0.3 M of the compound dissolved in 0.0075% of DMSO or the same amount of diluted DMSO was administered intratracheally 2 h before the viral challenge (n = 3 per group, respectively). As additional control, the effects on the viral entry of VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus were also examined. After 4 h, lung tissues were first refluxed with 50 ml of phosphate-based buffer, 50 ml of phosphate-based buffer containing 500 g/ml collagenase, and 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 g/ml trypsin, and then extracted. Extracted p24 was measured using a p24 ELISA kit. Right panel: For testing the TAPI-2, 25 l of 2 M of the compound in water or the same volume of distilled water was administered by the same method (right panel, n = 6 per group). We measured intracellular p24 by the similar procedures. (B) Effect of TAPI-2 on the production of TNF-\u2423. After viral infection with TAPI-2 or water as control, lung tissues, prepared without the refluxing using collagenase and trypsin, were subjected to the analysis of ELISA of TNF-\u2423 (n = 4 per group) (C) Effect of TAPI-2 on the viral infection of the infectious SARS-CoV. Left panel: Protocol for SARS-CoV inoculation and TAPI-2 treatment. In this experiment, we used TAPI-2 because it is water soluble. Although TAPI-0 seemed to be more effective than TAPI-2, TAPI-2 was better for in vivo experiments, because it was not necessary to include additional control groups treated with DMSO, a solvent of TAPI-0. Seven-week-old female Balb/c mice were pretreated with 20 l of 2 M of TAPI-2 or saline via intranasal injection under anesthesia. Soon afterward, these mice were infected with 20 l of 10 6.0 TCID50 mouse-passaged Frankfurt isolate of SARS-CoV (Nagata et al., 2008) via intranasal inoculation. Three hours and 1 day after virus inoculation, animals were treated with 20 l of TAPI-2 or saline via intranasal injection under anesthesia. Right panel: Virus titers in the lung lavage fluids 3 days after inoculation with saline or TAPI-2 (n = 4 per group). Balb/c mice on the virus titers in the lung lavage fluids after inoculation. The detection limit was 10 1.5 CCID50/ml of fluid. amount of the virus produced in vivo. Even a single particle of virus, once infected, can vigorously replicate in vivo and overcome the subtle inhibitory effects of the compounds on viral entry, implicating the importance to develop more potent antagonists. Recently, Lu et al. (2008) identified a specific inhibitor of TACE having an IC 50 of 1 nM against porcine TACE. It is plausible to speculate that such compound would suppress SARS-CoV infection more effectively than currently used TACE antagonists. The IC 50 of TAPI-0, which inhibited viral entry more efficiently than TAPI-2, is about 100 nM.",
