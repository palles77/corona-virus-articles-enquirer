The indirect dependence between these markets is modeled by assuming that the assets return and non-life insurance claims are led respectively by time-changed Brownian and jump processes, for which stochastic clocks are integrals of mutually selfexciting processes. This model exhibits delayed co-movements between financial and non-life insurance markets, caused by events like natural disasters, epidemics, or economic recessions.",

            "text": "Non life insurance claims, by nature, are not correlated to financial markets, excepted in case of events like natural disasters, epidemics, or serious economic recession. For example, in 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread across several countries and affected with a delay the insurance industry in different ways. Some areas of impacted insurance operations are clear-event cancellations coverage, travel insurance and life and health policies. This epidemic also slowed down economic exchanges and indirectly caused turmoil in financial markets. More recently, during the financial crisis of 2008, the number of claims covered by credit insurances surged in US, as underlined in a recent report from the IMF (2016). As last example, we mention climate changes. It is already affecting and will over time significantly affect the incidence of natural conditions such as: tropical cyclones; winter storms; wild-fires; hail storms; lightning strikes; droughts and floods. These events are expected to affect significantly property claims to non-life insurers. In parallel, climate change will have a huge economic and social impact and will lead to financial instability. These observations motivate us to study the influence of a potential contagion between the insurance and financial markets on the asset-liability management policy of insurers. E-mail address: donatien.hainaut@gmail.com. The literature about the modeling and management of non-life insurance company is vast. The starting point of research in this field is the classical Cramer- Lundberg (1903) risk model, in which the arrival of claims is modeled by a Poisson process. Since then, many extensions have been developed and proposed bounds on the insurer's ruin probability in various frameworks. Later, Bj\u00f6rk and Grandell (1988) and Embrechts et al. (1993) introduced a Cox process in the Cramer-Lundberg model, for the modeling of claim arrivals. Albrecher and Asmussen (2006) studied a Cox process with shot noise intensity. Zhao (2011, 2012) analyzed the clustering phenomenon of claims, caused by a self-exciting process. Another strand of the literature focuses on the optimization of investment, reinsurance and dividend policies, in a Cramer-Lundberg approach. For example, Browne (1995) showed in a one-dimensional diffusion model that the strategy maximizing the expected exponential utility of terminal wealth also minimizes the ruin probability. Asmussen and Taksar (1997) studied the optimal dividend policy for an insurer. Hipp and Plum (2000) optimized the investment policy of a non life insurer's surplus, in a Brownian setting. Schmidli (2002 Schmidli ( , 2006 instead of maximizing the utility of the surplus or dividends, adapted the investment and reinsurance strategies to minimize the probability of ruin. Kaluszka (2001 Kaluszka ( , 2004 examined the optimal reinsurance problem under various mean-variance premium principles. Yuen et al. (2015) considered the optimal proportional reinsurance strategy in a risk model with multiple dependent classes of insurance business. And recently, Yin and Yuen (2015) studied the optimal dividend problems for a jump diffusion model with capital injections and proportional transaction costs. Whereas Zheng et al. (2016) investigated the robust optimal portfolio and reinsurance problem for an ambiguity-averse insurer.",

            "text": "This work studies the optimal proportional reinsurance, dividends and asset allocation for a non-life insurer, in presence of a contagion risk between financial and insurance activities. Drawing on the theoretical and empirical background regarding the market time scale, as in An\u00e9 and Geman (2000) or Salmon and Tham (2007) , we build time-changed dynamics with chronometers that are integrated positive Hawkes processes. This approach, inspired from Hainaut (2016d) introduces a nonlinear dependence between assets and liabilities. Hawkes processes developed by Hawkes (1971a,b) and Hawkes and Oakes (1974) , are parsimonious self-exciting point processes for which the intensity jumps in response and reverts to a target level in the absence of event. This dynamics is increasingly used in finance to model the clustering of shocks. Empirical analysis conducted in A\u00eft-Sahalia et al. (2015 , 2014 or in Embrechts et al. (2011) emphasizes the importance of this effect in stocks or CDS markets. They also underline that clustering is not characterized by a single jump but by the amplification of this movement that takes place over days. Recently, Hainaut (2016a,b) detects self-excitation in interest rate markets. And the paper of (Hainaut, 2016c) analyzes the impact of the clustering of jumps on prices and risk of variable annuities. In this work, Hawkes processes determine the pace of market clocks.",

Indeed, when the clock of the financial (resp. insurance) market speeds up due to a jump of Z S t (resp. Z L t ), the chronometer of the insurance (resp. financial) market accelerates proportionally. This also raises the volatility as longer periods, measured on the market time scale, are observed on the same invariable chronological time scale. Another consequence of a jump is an instantaneous increase in the probability of observing a new financial or actuarial shock as \u03bb S t and \u03bb L t are the intensities of point processes Z S t and Z L t . We check by direct differentiation that intensities are the sum of a deterministic function and of two jump processes,",

As for the reinsurance rate, the optimal investment policy is based on the drift and variance measured on the financial market scale and not on the chronological scale. This is not the case of the optimal dividend that explicitly depends on intensities of clocks:However, as B S (t, T ) and B L (t, T ) converge toward zero when t \u2192 T , the influence of \u03bb S t and \u03bb L t is lessened with the passage of time. Even if the optimal management policy is determined, we do not have at this stage any information about the distribution of the optimal wealth, X * t . However, we can approach numerically its moments. Under the assumption that the optimal reinsurance ratio is close to the one in Eq. (33), the dynamics of the surplus is given by the next SDEand where functions C (t, T ), B L (t, T ) and B S (t, T ) are defined in Proposition 4.1 by the system of ODE's (30).If we replace in this last equation dS t S t by its expression (15) and dL t by its approximation (36), we infer that X t is now ruled by the SDE:By construction, the Brownian motions W L t and W S t are independent and the correlation is only induced by the stochastic clocks. ThenWe can then replace these two Brownian motions by a single one W t defined on the same filtration as followsThe insurer adjusts the investment, dividend and reinsurance policy so as to maximize the following objective:",
