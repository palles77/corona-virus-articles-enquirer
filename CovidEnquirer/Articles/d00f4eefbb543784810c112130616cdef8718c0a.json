The main research question is: what can we learn from the SARS experience about effective prevention of HIV/AIDS? The sources of data include population figures on the development of these epidemics and findings from two sociological studies of representative samples of Singapore's multi-ethnic population. The comparative study illustrates the impact of cultural beliefs and attitudes in shaping the public image of these two different infectious diseases; the relevance of public image of the disease for effective prevention and control of epidemics.",

            "text": "In contrast to the dismal HIV/AIDS situation, the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe asymptomatic respiratory syndrome or SARS, offers a completely different picture for the analysis of preventive efforts. Although SARS, like HIV/AIDS, was unknown in the medical world and hit unexpectedly, there are some significant differences, particularly in their etiology, epidemiology, natural history and clinical outcomes of the two diseases. HIV/AIDS is asymptomatic for 7-10 years after infection so that HIV-positive persons may continue to spread the disease unknowingly. The main mode of HIV/AIDS transmission is through direct contact with infected body fluids or blood (sexual intercourse, use of infected needles by drug users and receiving contaminated blood transfusions). SARS is caused by the SARS coronavirus and characterized by airborne transmission. SARS develops very rapidly, with an average incubation period of 5 days or a range of 2-10 days after contact. Within 1 week of the illness patients show typical influenza-like symptoms such as fever, malaise, and headache with cough and diarrhoea getting worst in the second week of infection. It has been determined that \"transmission occurs mainly during the second week of illness\". These external signs facilitate prompt action: exposed patients may be placed under fever surveillance twice a day \"in an isolation facility or ward for at least 10 days after the last exposure to the source case(s)\" [28] . In the span of 9 months SARS infected 8096 persons, caused 774 deaths (Appendix A, Table A .2) and became a widespread visible threat through the serious disruption of normal daily activities of individuals and major sectors of the economy such as transportation, commerce, industrial production, and tourism [28] [29] [30] . The first probable SARS case was reported in China on 16 November 2002 and the infection spread to 28 other countries around the world but the largest number of locally transmitted infections and deaths were reported in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, and Singapore (Appendix A, Table A .2). Despite the fact that SARS caught the world unprepared, hit at great speed, and it is very difficult to eradicate [31] , the outbreak was contained within 9 months, a relatively brief period of time (Appendix A, Table A .2).",

More specifically, why were the efforts to contain and prevent the spread of a new epidemic like SARS successful while it has taken 25 years so far to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS and no effective solution is yet in sight? Social science research has identified over the past decades a complex array of factors and conditions associated with disease prevention in individuals (micro-level analysis) as well as collectivities (macro-level analysis) but the factors and conditions vary for different diseases and there may be many other factors yet to be identified. Still, contrasting the two epidemics in terms of social attitudes and beliefs at the micro-and macro-levels, will help us to elucidate some of the major obstacles to HIV/AIDS prevention. Therefore, this paper focuses on only three possible factors: the impact of perceived severity and susceptibility to infection and the public image of the epidemic (micro-level factors); and the governance of epidemics (macro-level factor).",

Both social theories are useful in the analysis of preventive action: they focus on the individual's capacity to make his/her own decisions, and the recognition that there are multiple and varied factors involved in a person's health-related actions. The SCT explains people's health-related actions primarily in terms of their expectations of the outcome, their confidence in the success of their actions, and their ability to perform the action; but perhaps the most relevant aspect of the SCT is its consideration of the individual's environment as one of the important determinants of his/her behavior [36] .",

A comprehensive review of studies applying the HBM [37] found the variables perceived susceptibility and perceived severity to be closely correlated and to have significant influence upon a variety of preventive behaviors. The combination of both perceived severity and perceived susceptibility labeled \"perceived threat\" has been found to be a more significant explanatory variable than severity and susceptibility used separately [37] . The HBM variable influencing the perception of effective prevention of HIV/AIDS in three ethnic communities is perceived severity or seriousness of the disease, together with the perception of personal responsibility for contracting the disease [39] . I ascertained perceived severity of HIV/AIDS in terms of the respondents' subjective perception of the likelihood of death using the close-ended question \"When you think about AIDS, how serious do you feel it is? This approach is basically the same as that of Janz et al. [38] who define perceived severity as \"One's belief of how serious a condition and its sequelae are\". Strecher et al. had offered earlier [37] a wider definition of perceived severity: \"personal evaluations of the probable biomedical, financial and social consequences of contracting HIV and having AIDS\". Although there are slight variations in the wording of the question asked in interviews and in the definition of perceived severity, the general consensus in the literature is that this conceptual construct, often together with perceived susceptibility, is essential in the analysis of people's motivation to take preventive action. Nevertheless, as preventive health behavior is influenced by a multiplicity of factors, the HBM, SCT and all the other top eight theories [34] are limited as they offer only partial explanations of health-related behavior, but they are complementary.",

This process is suggested by many sociological theories including social networks and social support theory [40] , rational choice theory [41] , and the SCT. The SCT offers the concept \"reciprocal determinism\" [36] that proposes a dynamic interplay of \"the person, behavior, and the environment\". a Eight preventive measures were considered as part of the respondents' \"activities during the past 3 days\": covering the mouth with paper tissue or handkerchief when sneezing or coughing; covering the mouth with bare hand when sneezing or coughing; washing hands after sneezing or coughing; using soap or liquid hand-wash when washing hands; wearing a mask over the mouth; using serving utensils (chopsticks or spoons) for shared food when joining others for meals; when touching objects that may possible carry the SARS virus (e.g., door handles, buttons in lifts), taking preventive measures (e.g., pressing lift buttons with tissue paper); washing hands as soon as possible after touching objects that may possibly carry the SARS virus (e.g., door handles, buttons in lifts). b The original response categories for perceived susceptibility (that is, the perceived likelihood of contracting SARS) were: \"very likely\", \"likely\", \"not very likely\", \"not likely at all\" and \"don't know\".

Thus, my assumption that a person's motivation to take preventive action may also be manifested in his or her cooperation with community-based preventive measures is explained clearly by the application of the conceptual premises on community responses to stressor events formulated by Reiss and Oliveri [43] . The public's perception of the scope of the problem was highlighted by these authors as part of their concept \"community's punctuation of an event\". They defined the community's punctuation of an event or perceived scope as \"when the problem begins and when it ends and who is involved\". They proposed that the community and its leaders would be more inclined to invest concerted efforts to solve a problem if three conditions are met: accountability, duty, and competence [43] . That is, the community and its policy-makers would be most inclined to mobilize assistance and preventive efforts when these three conditions are met: the persons affected are perceived as not being accountable for the problem; they are regarded as having the duty to request outside help; they are considered as lacking the competence to solve by themselves the problem affecting them. I suggest that these three conditions shape the public image of SARS and HIV/AIDS and add to our understanding of the disparity in prevention effectiveness of these two epidemics at the community level.",

Governance is another socially significant aspect of HIV/AIDS and SARS as a strong political will at the national level is needed to invest state resources, and to utilize knowledge and technology creatively for their detection and prevention. But these epidemics are also global problems that challenge national boundaries and the conventional idea of state sovereignty and governance, and test international cooperation, because of their mode of transmission and the increasing movement of people across countries for leisure, trade, and study among other activities. Given the easiness and speed of their international transmission, these epidemics have unwittingly pushed forth a new phenomenon that Fidler [30] calls \"global health governance\" that is, \"the proposition that governance of public health issues must include not only state actors but also non-state actors\". Examining the international impact of SARS, this international law expert concluded that \"To govern an increasingly borderless world, requires, in essence, increasingly borderless governance\" [30] .",

Nonetheless, despite these methodological difficulties, I believe it is important to scrutinize available information on both epidemics in the hope of increasing our understanding of the dynamics of preventive action against HIV/AIDS.

SARS was imported into Singapore at the end of February, 2003, when an infected vacationer returned home from Hong Kong where she caught the infection while staying at the same Hong Kong hotel where a doctor from Guangzhou, China who had treated SARS patients there, was residing [50] . The unknown cause and nature of the disease deterred the assignment of blame or accountability. SARS patients were not held accountable for their illness. Nor were they assumed to have the expertise to solve the problem on their own although it soon became a duty for people with the publicized symptoms to seek immediate expert medical help [29, 51] . The findings from the SARS study in Table 2 show that 75.9% of the respondents made a positive appraisal of the health authorities' management and control of the SARS crisis; 77.4% had the chance to express their opinions to the authorities; 91.3% were prepared to be quarantined for 10 days after close contact with an infected person and 71.6% would agree to be quarantined even if there was non-close contact. Further indications of the public's willingness to collaborate in preventive efforts against SARS were the very positive attitudes of the majority of respondents: although about one of every two agreed that preventive measures taken against SARS \"have affected my personal choice and freedom in life\", most respondents (95.3%) agreed that \"people should be willing to make some personal sacrifices\" to contain the epidemic and 86% felt that \"people have mostly been socially responsible\".",

Among the 1202 respondents, the endorsement of the health authorities' crisis management was particularly supported by people who perceived the community as being socially responsible; those who believed that the crisis justified making some personal sacrifices (especially with regard to movement outside their homes, restricting or changing their travel patterns, and abiding by quarantine regulations); those felt that they had the chance to be part of the effort and express their personal opinions; people who had formed an opinion on their personal susceptibility to the infection (in contrast to those who had no or very little information on SARS). The Nagelkerke R 2 coefficient of 0.139 suggests the factors in the model explain 13.9% of the variation in endorsement of the crisis management in the total population. The analysis of the same factors was repeated among three specific subgroups that have shown less positive appraisal of crisis management: the senior cohort (respondents aged 60 and older), the lower educated (people with only primary or lower education), and Malays. As illustrated in Table 3 , even among the lower educated and the Malay, the sense of social responsibility was significantly associated with their endorsement of preventive efforts (dependent variable). However, perceived susceptibility to SARS did not influence significantly the appraisal of crisis management by the seniors and the less educated but it did among Malays in the expected direction: persons who have no idea of their susceptibility (no awareness of it) were most likely to give a negative appraisal of crisis management. No significant impact of perceived severity upon people's appraisal of crisis management was detected in the total sample or any of the three subgroups. Overall, the Nagelkerke R 2 coefficients indicate that, compared to the total sample, variables in the model helped explain a larger proportion of the variance in the dependent variable among subgroups such as seniors (43.7%), the less educated (33.8%) and the Malay community (29.0%) about 80% of the time. These figures point to the importance of variations the perception of and responses to crises among different segments of the population given their differences in life experiences, in knowledge and level of information on the problem, and in cultural values and beliefs, among other factors.",

In terms of the scope of the problem -when it begins and when it ends -the quiet and prolonged way in which the HIV virus enters and destroys the immune system represents a major challenge for the mobilization of public interest and support of testing. Visible signs of the disease tend to appear only in the late stages. The opposite occurred with respect to SARS. Two separate studies of the awareness of health threats in the United Kingdom confirm these findings on impact of the public image of the problem and punctuation or scope of the event: British lay respondents and journalists were inclined to see AIDS as a \"far-flung\" risk of no immediate relevance to their lives [62, 63] .",

            "text": "Regarding social acceptability, if the stressor is seen by the community as the consequence of socially unacceptable behavior, one would expect collective apathy or reluctance or opposition to the investment of public funds and efforts to contain and solve the problem. The findings in Tables 2, 3 and A.4 suggest that this appears to be the case with HIV/AIDS. The public image of HIV/AIDS tends to be shaped by normative expectations or stereotypes in the community. The large majority of the respondents (88.5%) associated a particular lifestyle with the contracting of the disease thus forming negative images of people living with HIV/AIDS. As shown in Table 1 , over half of the respondents (57%) saw them as \"risk-takers\": people who engage in activities that put them at risk of infection such as having multiple sexual partners or procuring the services of commercial sex workers. Another 26% of the respondents associated them with people who engage in 'deviant' activities such as commercial sex workers and injecting drug users who exchange infected needles. A small group (5.5%) considered them as \"victims\" of \"fate\" or \"bad luck\" or accidental infection. Only 11.5% of the respondents did not have an opinion or image of people living with HIV/AIDS. Practically all in this group had no information on HIV/AIDS. Table 4 presents some of the factors that contribute to the formation of a particular 'image' of people living with HIV/AIDS. The odds of seeing them as 'victims' (column b) were significantly higher among older people, those who do not think HIV/AIDS is a serious and deadly disease; and those who do not believe there is an effective way of preventing the illness. Interestingly, the same features are exhibited by the small group who did not put a label on people living with HIV/AIDS (column a): they tend to be older, unaware of the severity of the disease, and unaware of any effective preventive measures. The odds of perceiving HIV/AIDS sufferers as 'risk-takers' that is, associating a 'risk-taking' life style with HIV/AIDS infection (column c), decreased by 45% among men; increased significantly among people who worry about falling ill and those who believe that there are effective ways of preventing the disease. The most negative 'image' or lifestyle associated with HIV/AIDS infection is that labeled 'deviants' (column d). The odds of having this image of HIV/AIDS sufferers increase significantly among women in contrast to men; among younger people in contrast to people who are 60 or older; among those believe the disease is very severe, and among people who do not worry much about falling ill. The Nagelkerke R 2 coefficients indicate that the variables in the model explain 45.6% of the overall variation in emphasis on the 'victim' image; 19.5% of the emphasis on the 'risk-takers' image; 16.9% of the emphasis on the 'deviant' image, and 58.1% of the variance on the absence of a stereotypical image of HIV/AIDS sufferers. This variable is explained correctly by the variables in the model 92.7% of the time (Table 4 ). These findings fit the international pattern: the presence of stereotypical images of people who get infected with HIV/AIDS is not restricted to a particular country [23, 61] .",

This conceptual shift was unique. The approach to HIV/AIDS was \"the first time in history [that] preventing discrimination towards those affected by an epidemic became an integral part of a global strategy to prevent and control an epidemic of infectious disease\" [59, 30] . Danziger [26] suggests that this conceptual shift was promoted and supported by the \"neoliberal democratic ideology\" prevalent in Western countries by the end of the 20th century and enthusiastic enough to lead some countries to abandon the compulsory surveillance methods and \"placing protection of individual rights on a par with (or even above) the protection of the public health\".",

In June and July, 1981, five young homosexual men were diagnosed with pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and 26 young homosexual men with Kaposi's sarcoma \"a rare form of cancer which had until then been associated with elderly Americans\"; added to the spectrum of AIDS features in the early 1980s was the confirmation that one of the main forms of transmission is sexual intercourse [26] . The spread of the epidemic has been so extensive geographically as well as socially, that people living with HIV/AIDS today come from all walks of life. But as the figures in Appendix A, Table A .1 indicate, the highest prevalence of HIV are still found among some distinct lifestyle groups including commercial sex workers and injecting drug users. The survey data discussed in the preceding sections suggest that the public image of HIV/AIDS reflects the prevalence figures among some specific groups; a large majority of respondents saw HIV/AIDS sufferers as following their lifestyle by personal choice. Thus, their image remains negative despite public education efforts by the WHO, non-state organizations and non-governmental organizations. An additional aspect is the slow pace of development of the disease: people may be infected for many years without developing any symptoms and may thus continue unwittingly to infect others [26] .",

            "text": "The global governance approach to protect people with HIV/AIDS from discrimination involves avoidance of disclosure of one's health condition and of routinely or compulsory name-linked testing and other features of standard infectious disease surveillance. Danziger [26] sees this position as \"possessive individualism\" that demands testing to be done only if the person has consented freely and has received full information on the consequences through the process of informed consent. Moreover, Danziger points out that with the current stage of knowledge on HIV/AIDS, \"there is little or no gain for a HIV-infected person to be tested and identified as HIV-positive\" [26] . This reasoning creates a dilemma because experts agree that standard infectious disease surveillance is indispensable for the effective prevention and control of infectious diseases [3, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] 30, 52] that is, the beneficiaries of effective control and prevention are the rest of the community. According to Danziger [26] the dilemma has been sorted out internationally by an apparent consensus of stakeholders to consider HIV/AIDS as \"a crisis of human rights\" and not as a \"public health crisis\". However, with the epidemic proceeding unrelentingly, there are signs of concern. A recent development in Singapore is illustrative of the range of opinions on this matter: The Ministry of Health announced on 15 July 2005 that \"spouses of patients with HIV will be informed of their partner's illness, regardless of whether the infected person agrees\" [60] . The newspaper report cited the case of four women who discovered they had HIV when they did their blood test during their pregnancies. The husband of one of them had been diagnosed with HIV since 2001. Previously, patients were counseled and informed consent was required. Now the doctor needs only to keep the patient \"appropriately informed\". The spouses will be informed \"in a sensitive manner\" by trained personnel of a new HIV Prevention Unit. The Infectious Diseases Act will be invoked as is the case with all other infectious diseases [60] . The Singapore shift towards a version closer to standard surveillance of HIV/AIDS is indicative of its concern for the rights of the infected person as well as the rights of the patient's partner, and of all other persons involved. The global governance of HIV/AIDS prevention needs to address the public image of the disease and the impact that such an image has upon efforts to mobilize the community in prevention efforts. For as long as HIV/AIDS is seen as a problem of particular lifestyles (that is, of specific types of people), prevention efforts such as condom use and testing are bound to have limited impact.",

Given the differences in questions asked during the respective interviews, the 10-year difference between studies and the significant differences in the etiology, nature, and development of the two infectious diseases, the findings must be treated with caution. That said, the availability of data from the two studies offered a good opportunity for this exploratory comparison of attitudes towards and the public image of HIV/AIDS and SARS in search of a better understanding of the social obstacles to effective prevention against HIV/AIDS. This exploratory comparison was guided by two main assumptions. The first assumption was that a higher perception of disease severity and personal susceptibility to SARS as compared to the level of perceived susceptibility to and severity of HIV/AIDS, contributed to the difference in effectiveness of prevention efforts. The data from the Singapore study support that assumption partially and revealed a new aspect of the problem. Perceived susceptibility was high for SARS but relatively low for HIV/AIDS. The opposite was found for perceived severity. The findings suggest that among the complex set of factors that motivate people to take preventive measures, perceived susceptibility to the disease (your subjective assessment of the likelihood of becoming infected) is more relevant than perceived severity of the disease. The data show a strong tendency for people to consider HIV/AIDS as peculiar to certain types of people different from themselves. Thus their belief that their chances of being infected with the HIV virus are remote is not surprising. These findings on low perceived susceptibility and high perceived severity are also meaningful in the context of the second assumption tested.",

The findings verify and clarify these assumptions. Only 3 out of every 10 respondents expressed high perceived susceptibility to HIV/AIDS compared to 8 out of every 10 in the case of SARS. But, as mentioned above, it was also found that the perceived severity of HIV/AIDS was significantly higher than the perceived severity of SARS. More importantly, the labeling of people living with HIV/AIDS as 'risktakers' or 'deviants', was expressed by nine out of every 10 of the respondents who believed HIV/AIDS was a incurable disease (high perceived severity) and believed that the disease is mostly linked to one's lifestyle choice. The challenge for health authorities is to enhance the population's perceived susceptibility to HIV/AIDS. The first step in this direction is the widespread distribution of accurate, clear and consis-tent information on the 'silent' nature of the disease in its early stages.",

            "text": "The second part of this assumption was on the mobilization of the community's endorsement and active participation in the control and prevention of the epidemics. I have discussed the elements involved including the community's punctuation of the crisis and the aspects of accountability, duty, and competence. In the case of epidemics, competence is typically found at the community level and this brings us to the question of governance: how does a government deal with the health crisis represented by an infectious disease epidemic? Much has been learned over the centuries around the world but each new epidemic brings new dangers. The SARS outbreak tested the state's level of emergency preparedness and commitment to transparency particularly in Asian countries, but it also highlighted the need for global governance of health threats that cut across national boundaries. In contrast, the HIV/AIDS epidemic still represents a challenge in terms of public health, political ideology, human rights, and social discrimination. The lack of success in the control and prevention of the epidemic highlights the fact that after nearly three decades the global governance of HIV/AIDS is still a work-in-progress. The urgency of the problem is well recognized by most world leaders and specialists with some experts warning that \"new threats to [world] stability and secu-rity may emerge as the pandemic escalates\" because, among other reasons, large numbers among police and armed forces in many countries and UN peacekeeping forces are getting infected [27] . The current global governance of HIV/AIDS requires critical scrutiny, as well as active exploration of solutions -among all types of stakeholders with differing ideological and social perspectives -to the slackness of preventive efforts against the two main behaviors that are sustaining the epidemic: \"high-risk sexual activity and drug use\" [27] . One aspect of that critical scrutiny is the systematic and comparative analysis of HIV/AIDS global governance with the global governance of other infectious disease epidemics that have been successful. In sum, the findings on the SARS and HIV/AIDS experiences suggest that health authorities need to navigate effectively the local and global obstacles to prevention by: (a) enhancing the public's understanding of the etiology of HIV/AIDS, its modes of transmission and effective preventive measures; and (b) correcting the lay public's inaccurate perception of personal susceptibility and 'the punctuation of the event'.",
