            "text": "An increasing number of xenobiotics are associated with alterations in the hematopoietic system. These alterations encompass a variety of direct and indirect effects, many of which are associated with the intended pharmacology of the compound but may also be related to off-target effects. Alterations in the hematopoietic system are commonly reflected by changes in the peripheral blood components. Blood components include leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. Leukocyte subtypes in humans and common laboratory species include neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil counts. The erythrocyte component includes both total erythrocyte and reticulocyte counts. The complete blood count (CBC) is the standard method for analyzing blood leukocyte, erythrocyte, and platelet components. Absolute concentrations (cells mL \u00c0 1 ), conventionally referred to as absolute counts in nonclinical toxicity studies, should be used to evaluate and interpret changes in blood components because relative percentages do not account for the total numbers of cells present and may be misleading. Interpretation of xenobiotic-related alterations in blood components should be made with the consideration of the inherent biological variation in CBC endpoints observed in common laboratory species, and an understanding of the various mechanisms underlying increased or decreased blood component counts. There is considerable overlap in the mechanisms of blood cell alterations in both naturally occurring and xenobiotic-induced changes. The focus of this article is to review more commonly observed alterations in blood leukocyte, erythrocyte, and platelet components.",

Granulocyte pools in the bone marrow can be divided into proliferating (mitotic) and maturing (postmitotic) pools. The proliferating pool encompasses the most immature myeloid precursors: myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes. The maturing pool includes the later stages of metamyelocytes, band neutrophils, and mature segmented neutrophils. The mature segmented neutrophil population within the maturing pool is also considered the bone marrow storage pool, and acts as a reserve store of neutrophils that replenish blood stores following normal turnover and can be quickly mobilized to the blood in times of increased tissue demand. In health, mammalian blood neutrophils are mature, segmented neutrophils. They are distributed in two pools within the blood vessels, the circulating pool and the marginating pool. Circulating pool neutrophils flow freely through the vessel lumen and are sampled during blood collection. Marginating pool neutrophils are in contact with endothelial cells and temporarily adhere to or roll along the vessel wall. Neutrophils may shift between the circulating and marginating pools. The lifespan of a neutrophil in circulation is short (approximately 7 h half-life in blood), and ultimately neutrophils migrate into tissues where they survive for a few days (Smith, 2016) . Neutrophils are part of the innate immune system and primarily function as phagocytes to remove and destroy invading pathogens, but also can secrete proinflammatory and chemotactic mediators to enhance responses of both the innate and adaptive immune systems.",

Increases in circulating catecholamines are commonly associated with excitement, fear, or exercise, and at times are referred to as acute stress. Increases in neutrophil counts secondary to catecholamine stimulation are mostly attributable to a shift in neutrophils from the marginating pool to the circulating pool, resulting in increased numbers of freely flowing neutrophils captured during blood sampling, and may occur through decreased expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and potentially from increased blood flow and shear forces (Foster et al., 1986; Benschop et al., 1996; Stockham and Scott, 2008a; Everds et al., 2013a) . Splenic contraction resulting in redistribution of sequestered neutrophils to circulation also contributes. Mechanisms by which exogenous catecholamines and adrenergic agents cause increases in blood neutrophil counts are the same as those described for endogenous catecholamine stimulation.",

The predominant endogenous steroids are cortisone in most species or corticosterone in the rat. Classically, endogenous steroids cause increases in neutrophil counts that are accompanied by decreases in lymphocyte counts, increases in monocyte counts, and decreases in eosinophil counts. However, these effects may be variable depending on the species, and increases in neutrophil counts may be less prominent or absent in rats and mice. Interpretation of a stress or endogenous glucocorticoid effect in a nonclinical toxicity study should be made conservatively using a weight of evidence approach.

Neutrophil half-life may also be prolonged due to decreased apoptosis (Cox, 1995) . These increases in neutrophil lifespan may be associated with hypersegmentation of neutrophil nuclei that can be observed during blood smear evaluation. Glucocorticoids also increase the release of segmented and occasionally band neutrophils from the bone marrow storage pool, although this mechanism contributes to the neutrophilia to a lesser degree than shifting to the circulating pool (Stockham and Scott, 2008a; Nakagawa et al., 1998) .

Also, if the insult is effectively being resolved by the inflammatory response, tissue demand for neutrophils may decrease, resulting in release of fewer immature stages and the appearance of a chronic inflammatory pattern. In nonclinical toxicology studies, certain procedure-related effects, such as long-term catheterization, may cause an inflammatory leukogram (Hall, 2013) .",

            "text": "In some cases, a leukemoid response or extreme neutrophilia may occur. A leukemoid response is characterized by a persistent leukocytosis of >50,000 cells mL \u00c0 1 , typically due to a marked neutrophilia with a left shift that remains orderly and may or may not have morphologic changes indicative of rapid granulopoiesis (Schultze, 2010; Sakka et al., 2006) . Extreme neutrophilia typically has > 100,000 cells mL \u00c0 1 and evidence of a left shift. The terms leukemoid reaction and extreme neutrophilia are most appropriately applied retrospectively, after the possibility for hematopoietic neoplasia has been excluded. Differentiation of a leukemoid response or extreme neutrophilia from chronic myelogenous leukemia or chronic neutrophilic leukemia includes CBC, blood smear, and bone marrow evaluations in most species, and may also include leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic analysis (e.g., evaluation for bcr-abl translocation), serum G-CSF, and clonality evaluations in humans (Schultze, 2010; Sakka et al., 2006) . Leukemoid reactions have been associated with carcinomas of various origins, including renal and pulmonary carcinomas, Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma, and sarcomas, and may be attributable to aberrant production of proinflammatory mediators by the neoplasm, such as G-CSF, GM-CSF, or IL-6 (Sakka et al., 2006) . Leukemoid reactions have also been reported in F334/N rats affected by large granular cell leukemia (Car et al., 2006) . However, leukemoid reactions may also be associated with infectious processes, including disseminated tuberculosis, Clostridium difficile colitis, severe shigellosis (Sakka et al., 2006) , chronic localized suppurative lesions such as pyometra, pleuritis, and internal abscesses (Schultze, 2010; Stockham and Scott, 2008a) . Leukemoid reactions may also be seen secondary to severe hemorrhage or immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (Schultze, 2010; Sakka et al., 2006) . 12.11.2.1.1.4 Inherited leukocyte adhesion deficiencies Increases in neutrophil counts associated with deficiencies in leukocyte adhesion molecules may manifest as a leukemoid response or extreme neutrophilia. Adhesion molecules expressed on neutrophils are responsible for neutrophil margination, rolling along vessel walls, and emigration into tissues. L-selectin (CD62L) mediates low-affinity initial binding of leukocyte to endothelial cells, while integrins, including CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1), mediate firm adhesion to endothelial cells and ligands in the extracellular matrix (Muller, 2012) . Neutrophils constitutively express CD11b/CD18. A deficiency of this integrin (leukocyte adhesion deficiency [LAD] type 1) results in the failure of neutrophils to emigrate to tissues, and may result in severe, recurrent bacterial infections (Arnaout, 1990) . LAD type 2 is due to an inherited disorder of fucose metabolism, resulting in the lack of selectin ligands expressed on neutrophils and therefore results in immunodeficiency from a failure of selectin-mediated neutrophil rolling along vessel walls (Marquardt et al., 1999) . Leukocyte adhesion deficiencies have been reported in humans, dogs, mice, and Holstein cattle (Arnaout, 1990; Marquardt et al., 1999; Gu et al., 2004) .",

Heparin-related release of CXCL12, a chemokine that is constitutively expressed by bone marrow stromal cells and plays a role in bone marrow neutrophil retention and leukocyte trafficking, may alter bone marrow and circulating CXCL12 gradients and promote release of neutrophils from the bone marrow storage pool, contributing to the increases in circulating neutrophil counts (Zhang et al., 2012) .",

While the goal for treatment in chemotherapy patients is to increase blood neutrophil counts to normal levels and not to achieve increased neutrophil counts, repeated or high dose administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF-related compounds to healthy laboratory animals results in markedly increased neutrophil counts. Typically these changes are associated with a left shift and cytoplasmic changes indicative of rapid neutropoiesis. Dysplastic changes may also occur, most commonly recognized by the presence of unusually large neutrophils or hypersegmented neutrophils in circulation. Several xenobiotics appear to induce increases in neutrophil counts by stimulating increases in endogenous G-CSF or an inflammatory stimulus. Early in the course of treatment with clozapine, an antipsychotic agent, rats have been shown to have spikes in G-CSF with concomitant increases in bone marrow granulopoiesis and release of less mature neutrophils into circulation (Lobach and Uetrecht, 2014) . However, other xenobiotics may directly cause an inflammatory stimulus and increase in endogenous proinflammatory stimuli, such as G-CSF and IL-1, which result in increases in neutrophil counts. For example, lithium, which has been used in treatment of bipolar disorder and in combination with antidepressants, also appears to cause increased neutrophil counts due to increased G-CSF (Focosi et al., 2009) .",

Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is a drug-related skin reaction that generally occurs within 2 days of drug administration but resolves spontaneously within 15 days (Roujeau, 2005) . Increases in eosinophil counts may or may not be observed along with the increases in neutrophil counts. Xenobiotics classically associated with this syndrome include diltiazem and antibiotics such as aminopenicillins and pristinamycine (Roujeau, 2005) . Acute febrile dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome) has also been associated with elevations in circulating neutrophil counts, and drug-induced forms of this condition have been variably linked to a variety of compounds, including GM-CSF, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline, celecoxib, furosemide, and azathioprine (Rochet et al., 2013; Saavedra et al., 2006) . 12.11.2.1.2 Decreases in neutrophil counts (neutropenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis) 12.11.2.1.2.1 Overwhelming or severe acute inflammation Although inflammation often causes increases in neutrophil counts, an overwhelming or severe acute inflammatory stimulus may result in decreases in neutrophil counts. Such an inflammatory stimulus, sometimes also referred to as peracute inflammation, is commonly observed with bacterial sepsis. Decreases in neutrophil counts are a result of emigration to tissues that exceed the bone marrow capacity to release neutrophils. Proinflammatory mediators and chemoattractants stimulate increased neutrophil margination, firm adhesion to endothelial cells, and emigration into tissue, which shortens neutrophil circulating half-lives and depletes the circulating neutrophil pool. As neutrophils are released from the bone marrow and the storage pool is depleted, recruitment of immature neutrophils into circulation results in a left shift in which the number of immature forms exceeds the number of mature segmented neutrophils (degenerative left shift). If the stimulus persists long enough, granulocytic hyperplasia of the bone marrow will occur and the numbers of circulating neutrophils will increase and shift toward greater numbers of mature than immature neutrophils.",

There is evidence that this upregulation of CD18 contributes to neutrophil vascular sequestration in the lungs and liver, but there is also evidence for other mechanisms, such as cytoskeletal changes that alter neutrophil deformability, causing the initial vascular sequestration of neutrophils that is consistently observed with endotoxemia (Wagner and Roth, 1999) . The decreases in neutrophil counts associated with endotoxemia tend to be rapid but transient, and detection of these decreases in neutrophil counts will depend on timing of the blood collection in relation to endotoxemic and other concurrent or subsequent proinflammatory stimuli.",

Decreases in neutrophil counts by this mechanism tend to occur rapidly, within a few hours to 2 days after exposure (Schwartzberg, 2006) . Some xenobiotics mediate their effects by acting as haptens, which induce an antibody response targeting an antigen formed by the xenobiotic-neutrophil combination. Drugs reported to act as haptens include penicillin, gold-based compounds, aminopyrine, and propylthiouracil (Salama et al., 1989; Murphy et al., 1985) . These xenobiotics induce neutrophil destruction in a drug-dependent manner, and discontinuation of treatment generally results in resolution of blood neutrophil counts within 7 days (Schwartzberg, 2006) . Some xenobiotics, including propylthiouracil and quinidine sulfate, cause the formation of immune complexes that can subsequently bind and destroy neutrophils, even if the xenobiotic is no longer present (Schwartzberg, 2006; Bhatt and Saleem, 2004; Eisner et al., 1977) . In addition, some xenobiotics, such as propylthiouracil, may also cause the formation of antineutrophil antibodies resulting in complement-mediated neutrophil destruction (Akamizu et al., 2002) . Similar to idiopathic aplastic anemia, xenobiotic-induced aplastic anemia is most commonly associated with immune-mediated destruction of uncommitted or early hematopoietic stem cells, although direct cytotoxicity, such as with chemotherapeutic agents, may also lead to aplastic anemia. Several xenobiotics, including chloramphenicol, anticonvulsants such as phenytoin and carbamazepine, gold-based compounds, and phenylbutazone have been associated with aplastic anemia (Bloom and Brandt, 2008) .",

Thienopyridine inhibitors of platelet aggregation, including clopidogrel and ticlopidine, have also been associated with direct neutrophil toxicity resulting from mitochondrial toxicity by metabolites generated through myeloperoxidase metabolism of the parent compounds (Maseneni et al., 2012 (Maseneni et al., , 2013 .",

However, increases in lymphocyte counts are commonly observed with chronic inflammatory processes. Chronic stimulation of lymphocytes with antigens or cytokines results in the increased production of lymphocytes with release into the blood, causing the increases in blood lymphocyte counts. Reactive lymphocytes may be observed in blood accompanying inflammation-induced increases in lymphocytes counts. Reactive lymphocytes have a spectrum of morphologic changes that include increased cytoplasmic basophilia, large cells with mildly increased amounts of cytoplasm (lower nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios), variable patterns of chromatin clumping, and variable numbers of visible nucleoli. Occasionally, reactive lymphocytes may have paranuclear cytoplasmic clearing, giving a plasmacytoid appearance. Infectious mononucleosis syndromes in people are a relatively common cause of an inflammatory or reactive increase in lymphocyte counts that are usually acute (Vasu and Caligiuri, 2016) . Chronic infections leading to increase in blood lymphocyte counts may include visceral leishmaniasis, parasitic infections such as strongyloidiasis, and leprosy (Vasu and Caligiuri, 2016; Rai et al., 2008; Myers et al., 2000) .

A normal circulating lymphocyte population should be heterogeneous, with predominantly small lymphocytes and fewer intermediate to large lymphocytes. Increased blood lymphocyte counts with a loss of heterogeneity in the blood lymphocyte population or predominantly a monomorphic intermediate to large lymphocyte population are key features for diagnosing lymphoproliferative neoplasia. With the exception of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is characterized by increased numbers of small lymphocytes with few or subtle morphologic alterations, circulating lymphocytes often have abnormal morphologic features that may be observed microscopically. Abnormal morphologic features of the leukemic lymphocyte population may include increased cytoplasmic basophilia, increased amounts of cytoplasm with altered nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, irregular clumping of nuclear chromatin, indentation or lobulation of nuclei, variably sized but typically prominent nucleoli, or multiple nucleoli. Some of these morphologic features are similar to those observed in reactive lymphocytes, but these two processes may be distinguished by the overall heterogeneity of the lymphocyte population and proportion of the lymphocyte population with these morphologic alterations. Additional testing, such as flow cytometry for phenotyping or PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement (PARR), also aids in the diagnosis or characterization of lymphoproliferative neoplasia.",

Glucocorticoids induce decreases in blood lymphocyte counts through several mechanisms. In addition to a rapid shift of lymphocytes from the circulating to marginating and tissue pools, there is evidence for both lymphocyte redistribution from blood to bone marrow (Fauci, 1975) and decreased efflux of lymphocytes from lymphoid tissues (Bloemena et al., 1990) contributing to the shift of lymphocytes to tissue pools. With long-term increases in glucocorticoid concentrations, lymphotoxicity may be observed due to an increased activation of apoptotic pathways (Garvy et al., 1993; Tuckermann et al., 2005) . In rats, feed restriction has been associated with decreases in blood lymphocyte counts and lymphocyte depletion in various lymphoid tissues (Moriyama et al., 2008) , possibly associated with prolonged stress and therefore a glucocorticoid-mediated effect. Indirect test article-related effects mediated by altered food consumption are important to consider in nonclinical toxicology studies, in which test articles may cause direct or indirect hematologic effects. Interpretation of these changes, including stress-associated effects, must be made cautiously and thoughtfully, using a weight of evidence approach.",

SCID may be inherited through autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive patterns, and causes consistent decreases in T-cells, with concurrent decreases in B-cells or NK-cells in some forms of the disease. SCID in humans is caused by a variety of mechanisms, including: adenosine deaminase deficiency resulting in early cell death due to metabolite accumulation; common gamma chain or janus kinase 3 (JAK3) mutations that cause decreased survival of T-cell precursors due to defective cytokine signaling; recombinase-activating gene 1 (RAG1) or RAG2 mutations that cause defective V(D)J rearrangement of B-cell and T-cell receptors; and mutations in CD3 or CD45 that cause defects in T-cell receptor signaling (Suter, 2010; Notarangelo, 2010) . SCID in Jack Russell terriers, Arabian foals, and mice has been demonstrated to be caused by defective V(D)J recombination due to loss of DNA-dependent protein kinase (Meek et al., 2001 ). X-linked SCID has been described in both Bassett Hounds and Welsh Corgi dogs (Suter, 2010) .

Increases in monocyte counts have also been associated with bacterial endocarditis and sepsis, osteomyelitis, various pyogranulomatous diseases, candidiasis, viral infections including cytomegalovirus and influenza, and several parasitic diseases including pneumocystosis, Entopolypoides macacai infection in old world monkeys and apes, and dirofilariasis in dogs (Lichtman, 2016a; Magden et al., 2015; Schultze, 2010) . However, increases in monocyte counts may be less commonly related to malaria, leishmaniasis, and rickettsial diseases in people than previously thought (Lichtman, 2016a) . Noninfectious causes of increases in blood monocyte counts include inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative gastritis, myocardial infarction, and parturition (Lichtman, 2016a) .",

Inflammatory increases in eosinophil counts in response to helminths are cytokine (e.g., IL-5) mediated (Valent, 2009 ), but IgE and histamine release from mast cells, anaphylatoxin (e.g., C5a) production from complement activation, helper T-cell activation, and direct stimulation of eosinophils with helminthic antigens also play a role in eosinophil recruitment (Wardlaw, 2016; Leder and Weller, 2000; McEwen, 1992) . Helminth migration through host tissues is a key factor in stimulating increases in blood eosinophils and tissue eosinophilic inflammation, and helminths that remain confined to the intestinal lumen may not result in an eosinophil response (Leder and Weller, 2000) . The degree of the eosinophil response and increases in blood eosinophil counts are also dependent on parasite burden, maturation, and distribution in tissues (Leder and Weller, 2000) . Ascariasis, strongyloidiasis, trichinosis, filariasis, and ancylosomiasis have all been associated with increases in eosinophil counts in humans (Wardlaw, 2016; Tefferi et al., 2006; Leder and Weller, 2000) , and many of these may also be observed in common laboratory species (Schultze, 2010; Magden et al., 2015; Korenaga et al., 1991; Ogilvie et al., 1980) . Helminth infection in most purpose-bred laboratory animals is uncommonly observed during nonclinical toxicology studies due to breeding and housing facility biosecurity measures, but several less commonly used large animal species from other sources, such as farm pigs, calves, and sheep, have helminth infections more frequently observed.",

            "text": "Allergic inflammation is another common cause of increases in blood eosinophil counts. Allergic conditions associated with increases in blood eosinophil counts include asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis although increases in eosinophil counts with these conditions are usually mild (Wardlaw, 2016) . Allergic inflammation associated with immediate release of IgE is considered a type I hypersensitivity reaction. Some allergen-induced inflammation may be attributable to type IV (delayed-type or cell-mediated) hypersensitivity following T H activation with subsequent eosinophil recruitment. However, some differences have been observed between atopic dermatitis and classic type IV hypersensitivity (Gaga et al., 1991) , so not all T H -mediated allergic inflammation may represent a true type IV hypersensitivity reaction. As with most forms of inflammatory increases in blood eosinophil counts, production of cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-5 and eotaxin, appear to play a major role. In allergic asthma, activated T-helper type 2 (T H 2) cells release or stimulate the release of these cytokines and chemokines, resulting in recruitment and activation of eosinophils (Rosenberg et al., 2013) . Sensitization of the airways to ovalbumin with subsequent challenge in mice has mimicked many of the clinical and pathological features of allergic asthma, including the interaction of T H 2 cells and eosinophils (Rosenberg et al., 2013) . However, asthma encompasses a heterogeneous set of phenotypes and not all forms demonstrate clinical improvement in response to therapies targeting IL-5 or eosinophils (Wegmann, 2011) . While asthma is uncommon in most laboratory animal species, it can be experimentally induced in mice and may occur naturally in cats. Activation of T H 2 and T H 1 cells have been proposed to contribute to the pathology of atopic dermatitis, with the T H 2 activation being of particular relevance to the development of increases in blood eosinophil counts (Grewe et al., 1998) , similar to allergic asthma. Activation of T H 2 cells also plays a role in cytokine and chemokine elaboration with eosinophil recruitment in allergic rhinitis, although effects on eosinophils in allergic rhinitis are also mediated by histamine and IgE release from mast cells and histamine release from basophils (Borish, 2003) .",

Similar to glucocorticoid-induced decreases in eosinophil counts, there is likely shifting of blood basophils from the circulating to marginating pool. There is also evidence that glucocorticoids cause migration of basophils from circulation into tissues and decrease recirculation from tissue back into blood (Wald et al., 1991) . Direct lytic effects on blood or tissue basophils and suppression of basophil production in the bone marrow may also contribute (Boseila, 1963) .

In neonates, foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis may be observed within the liver histologically. In rats and mice, erythropoiesis within the spleen often significantly contributes to the maintenance of normal blood erythrocyte content.

Erythrocyte differentiation begins with pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells that differentiate into common myeloid progenitor cells, which further differentiate into megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells. Under stimulation with EPO, megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors differentiate into the first committed erythroid progenitor, the burst-forming unit erythrocyte (BFU-E), which then differentiates into colony-forming unit erythrocyte (CFU-E) precursors. The next stage in erythroid development is the rubriblast, which is the earliest erythroid progenitor that may be identified with light microscopy. Erythroid cell maturation then progresses through prorubricyte, basophilic rubricyte, polychromatophilic rubricyte, and metarubricyte stages. As these stages progress, the nuclear chromatin becomes more condensed and the nucleus becomes pyknotic, coinciding with increased hemoglobin production and accumulation within the cytoplasm and simultaneously decreased RNA production. At this point, pyknotic nuclei are extruded from the cell to form reticulocytes, which are released from the bone marrow. Proliferative bone marrow erythrocyte pools include rubriblasts through basophilic rubricytes, while maturing bone marrow erythrocyte pools include polychromatophilic rubricytes and reticulocytes.",

In health, the vast majority of blood erythrocytes are mature erythrocytes, with only a very small proportion of reticulocytes, except in rodents.

Eventually the clonal expansion is sufficient to suppress normal hematopoiesis . Increases in red cell mass are the prototypical findings, but concurrent increases in leukocyte and platelet counts that arise from the neoplastic clone are often also be observed in people (Pearson, 2001) , although these findings are typically not observed in dogs or cats (Randolph et al., 2010) . The most common causative somatic mutation of polycythemia vera in humans is a mutation of JAK2, a kinase that plays a role in intracellular proliferative signaling (Prchal, 2016) . However, forms of polycythemia vera or \"idiopathic erythrocytosis\" without JAK2 mutations have been observed and associated with mutations in lymphocyte-specific adaptor protein (LNK) that inhibits JAK2 phosphorylation (Lasho et al., 2010) .

The regenerative erythroid response is considered appropriate if the increases in reticulocyte counts reflect the magnitude of the decreases in red cell mass; in other words, a mild decrease in red cell mass is expected to result in a mild increase in reticulocyte count, while a moderate to marked decrease in red cell mass should have a concurrent moderate to marked increase in reticulocyte count. The regenerative erythroid response is considered inappropriate if there is an inconsistency between the magnitude of the decrease in red cell mass and the magnitude of the increase in reticulocyte count.

Due to the reticulocyte's increased volume relative to mature erythrocytes, increases in blood reticulocyte counts may cause increases in MCV (macrocytosis) and decreases in MCHC (hypochromasia). Regenerative anemias with increases in MCV and decreases in MCHC and/or CHCM may also be classified by these indices as macrocytic, hypochromic anemias. The decrease in MCHC does not necessarily reflect less hemoglobin content per cell, but is a consequence of reduced concentration of hemoglobin due to the larger cytoplasmic volume of reticulocytes. MCHC, which is a calculated endpoint, may be artificially increased when free plasma hemoglobin is present due to intravascular hemolysis. Some automated hematology analyzers also provide the corpuscular mean hemoglobin content (CHCM) which provides a mean of direct measurements of cellular hemoglobin concentration and is therefore resistant to interference from free plasma hemoglobin.",

Most commonly, increases in polychromatophils (polychromasia) are observed with Wright-Giemsa or modified Wright stains. Polychromatophils are erythrocytes that stain blue-purple in color due to the combined effects of blue-staining RNA content typical of reticulocytes and pink-staining hemoglobin. As reticulocytes mature and lose RNA, a visual difference in staining cannot longer be detected between late reticulocytes and mature erythrocytes. However, staining of blood with a vital dye such as New Methylene Blue permits differentiation between aggregate and punctatetype reticulocytes. Polychromasia usually correlates well with increases in reticulocytes in most species, except cats (Stockham and Scott, 2008b) . In cats, aggregate-type but not punctate-type reticulocytes correlate with polychromasia and are considered clinically relevant, and differentiation of these two with manual reticulocyte counts should be performed (Harvey, 2012; Stockham and Scott, 2008b) . Reticulocytes or erythrocytes with few small, punctate dark blue-gray inclusions may be observed during a regenerative erythroid response. These inclusions contain iron and may be called Pappenheimer bodies or siderotic inclusions. Due to the rapid production and release of erythrocytes during a regenerative erythroid response, there may also be increase in nucleated red blood cells or erythrocytes with Howell-Jolly bodies. Nucleated red blood cells are usually present in low numbers, but if 10 or more are observed per 100 leukocytes, the automated total leukocyte count will be falsely increased and should be corrected using published equations (Stockham and Scott, 2008a) . In some species, particularly cows and sheep, erythrocytes with basophilic stippling may also be observed in circulation during a regenerative erythroid response.",

            "text": "Destruction of mature erythrocytes is called hemolysis. Hemolysis may occur either intravascularly or extravascularly. With intravascular hemolysis, erythrocyte destruction occurs within the blood and results in hemoglobinemia, or free hemoglobin within plasma. Ghost erythrocytes, or the remnant membranes of erythrocytes that no longer contain cytoplasm or hemoglobin, may be observed with intravascular hemolysis. Consequent hemoglobinuria, or free hemoglobin in the urine, is rare and only occurs in cases of massive intravascular hemolysis that overwhelm the normal pathways that clear free hemoglobin from the blood. In contrast, extravascular hemolysis does not occur within the blood, but rather occurs in the spleen, liver, or bone marrow, where resident macrophages phagocytose erythrocytes and destroy them intracellularly. Extravascular hemolysis does not result in free plasma hemoglobin or hemoglobinuria. Both types of hemolysis may be associated with increases in total bilirubin concentrations where unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin usually exceeds conjugated (direct) bilirubin, and may result in plasma or serum icterus (yellow discoloration) or bilirubinuria (bilirubin present in urine). However, not all cases of hemolysis are clearly either intravascular or extravascular, and both forms of hemolysis may contribute in some conditions. 12.11.3.2.1.1.1 Infectious There are numerous protozoal, bacterial, and viral diseases that can be associated with hemolysis. Mechanisms by which infectious agents cause erythrocyte destruction are varied, and may include direct infection of erythrocytes, elaboration of toxins such as hemolysin, or stimulation of an immune-mediated response against infected cells (Berkowitz, 1991) . Several examples of infectious agents that cause hemolytic anemia are discussed later.",

            "text": "Direct infection of erythrocytes with protozoal Plasmodium species, the causative agent of malaria that is transmitted by mosquitoes, is a relatively common cause of hemolysis in humans, but may also be observed in nonhuman primates used in nonclinical toxicology studies. Humans are infected by one of five different Plasmodium species: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. knowlesi, P. malariae, or P. ovale, although only P. falciparum and P. vivax are commonly associated with severe hemolysis (Lichtman, 2016b) . Macaques are most commonly infected with P. inui or P. knowlesi, although the cynomolgus monkey appears to be more resistant to disease from these infections than the rhesus monkey (Ameri, 2010) . Infection with P. cynomolgi, P. fieldi, or P. fragile may also occur in macaques (Magden et al., 2015) . Although it is uncommon to include macaques infected with Plasmodium species during a nonclinical toxicity study due to current screening practices and pretest evaluations, rare animals with decreases in red cell mass and increases in reticulocyte counts and intraerythrocytic Plasmodium organisms have been observed. Rats and mice may be infected with Plasmodium berghei (Holloway et al., 1995; Sadun et al., 1965) . Plasmodium berghei has a specific tropism for reticulocytes rather than mature erythrocytes Plasmodium species that infect humans (Car et al., 2006; Cromer et al., 2006) . Concurrent increases in reticulocyte counts may occur in early stages or disease or with recrudescence of parasitemia and hemolysis. Hemolysis is associated with clearance of parasitized erythrocytes from circulation predominantly by splenic macrophages (Lichtman, 2016b) , although accumulation of hemin, an iron-containing porphyrin, which can directly stimulate apoptotic erythrocyte death (eryptosis) (Gatidis et al., 2009) , oxidative damage to erythrocyte membranes (Clark and Hunt, 1983) , and increased osmotic fragility (George et al., 1967) may all contribute to hemolysis. However, late-stage infections in humans and rodents have also been associated with inappropriate or decreased reticulocyte counts indicative of suppressed erythropoiesis despite decreases in red cell mass from hemolysis (Lichtman, 2016b; Cromer et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "12.11.3.2.1.1.2 Oxidative Another major cause of decreases in red cell mass due to hemolysis is oxidative damage to erythrocytes. Under normal conditions, ferrous iron (Fe 2 \u00fe ) in hemoglobin binds to and dissociates from oxygen as it delivers oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. At times, this binding and dissociation results in the formation of ferric iron (Fe 3 \u00fe ) in hemoglobin (methemoglobin) as well as superoxide (O 2 \u00c0 ). Superoxide is a free radical with potent oxidative capacity that may cause cellular damage. Cytochrome b 5 -reductase is an intraerythrocytic enzyme that converts methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. Superoxide dismutase converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), which also may produce oxidative damage to cells. Further metabolism of hydrogen peroxide by catalase or glutathione peroxidase protects cells from oxidative damage. These pathways are usually sufficient to address the normal low-level formation of methemoglobin and superoxide, but methemoglobin can increase and impair delivery of oxygen to tissues and superoxide can accumulate and cause oxidative damage if these pathways are overwhelmed or defective. Oxidative damage to erythrocytes may affect the lipid membranes, cytoskeleton, or hemoglobin. Peroxidation of internal membrane lipids or cytoskeletal components of erythrocytes results in the fusion of portions of the membrane with consequent shifting of the cytoplasm and hemoglobin to one side of the cells. Erythrocytes with this morphologic change are called eccentrocytes. Oxidative damage that causes the formation of eccentrocytes may result in hemolysis due to increased clearance of eccentrocytes by splenic macrophages due to trapping of rigid erythrocytes in splenic sinusoids or spontaneous rupture in blood due to the increased fragility of eccentrocytes (Stockham and Scott, 2008b) .",

Denatured hemoglobin may then precipitate and aggregate within the erythrocyte, forming small, pale-staining round structures that bind to the erythrocyte membrane and tend to protrude from the surface of the erythrocyte. These aggregates of denatured hemoglobin are called Heinz bodies. Cats appear to be particularly sensitive to the formation of Heinz bodies because of an increased number of reactive sulfhydryl groups in hemoglobin relative to other species (Christopher et al., 1990) , and may be more rapidly observed on blood smear evaluation due to the nonsinusoidal architecture of the feline spleen that results in decreased clearance of Heinz bodies from circulation. Similar to eccentrocytes, erythrocytes with Heinz bodies may undergo hemolysis due to increased clearance by splenic macrophages following trapping in splenic sinusoids due to decreased erythrocyte deformability and spontaneous rupture due to increased fragility from membrane damage; immune-mediated clearance may also occur and is believed to result from binding of hemochromes to and subsequent redistribution of band 3, an erythrocyte membrane structural protein, which may then be recognized by autologous antibodies (Winterbourn, 1990) .",

Inherited deficiencies in erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) have also been associated with erythrocyte oxidative damage, eccentrocyte or Heinz body formation, and hemolysis or a predisposition for these events due to the loss of protective antioxidant pathways (Chan et al., 1982; Harvey, 2006) . Lymphoma has also been associated with Heinz body formation in cats (Christopher, 1989) and eccentrocytes formation in dogs (Caldin et al., 2005) . In dogs and cats, ingestion of Allium species, particularly onions, garlic, and Chinese chive, may cause erythrocyte oxidative damage with formation of eccentrocytes and/or Heinz bodies (Caldin et al., 2005; Yamato et al., 2005; Robertson et al., 1998) . Ingestion of zinc in dogs (Bexfield et al., 2007) and exposure to skunk musk (Fierro et al., 2013) have also been reported to cause hemolysis due to Heinz body formation.",

Sometimes this type of hemolysis is referred to as microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Morphologic changes to erythrocytes occur as a result of physical trauma. Schistocytes (also called schizocytes or erythrocyte fragments), keratocytes (also called helmet cells), prekeratocytes (also called blister cells), or even spherocytes or microspherocytes may be observed. Schistocytes are very small, usually irregularly shaped fragments that can break off erythrocytes when physical trauma occurs. Keratocytes have one to two variably sized projections or horns adjacent to a small flattened region of the erythrocyte surface, while prekeratocytes appear to be precursors that have small loops of erythrocyte cytoplasm extending from the surface and surrounding a small hole in the cell. Spherocytes and microspherocytes are spherical cells that appear smaller and have more intensely pink-staining cytoplasm than normal mature erythrocytes. Spherocytes and microspherocytes may be formed during physical trauma as fragments are broken off, resulting in less membrane surface area in the parent erythrocyte surrounding a similar volume (spherocytes) or smaller volume (microspherocytes) as the parent erythrocyte.",

Agglutination may be observed grossly as red speckling along the inside of the specimen tube as blood is gently moved within the tube. If agglutination is present, blood smears may have a \"reverse smear\" appearance with the densest region of the smear observed at the feathered edge rather than the edge where the drop of blood was initially placed. Microscopically agglutination appears as grape-like clusters of erythrocytes. Spherocytes are erythrocytes that are spherical instead of having the normal biconcave disc shape. While spherocytes appear smaller and stain more intensely pink that unaffected mature erythrocytes, they have the same volume as unaffected erythrocytes. Loss of erythrocyte membrane occurs when macrophages begin to phagocytize antibody-bound erythrocytes, leading to decreased erythrocyte surface area without an appreciable change in volume, forcing erythrocytes to form spheres. Hence, spherocytosis alone will not result in an altered MCV. Of the most common laboratory species, dogs tend to have the most pronounced central pallor of normal mature erythrocytes, making microscopic identification of spherocytes easiest in the dog.",

The mechanism of hemolysis in sickle cell disease is likely multifactorial and not associated with a single pathogenesis. There is evidence for oxidative damage to erythrocytes (Lachant et al., 1983) , which may contribute to the hemolysis observed with sickle cell disease. However, hemoglobin polymerization leads to erythrocyte deformation and may lead to decreased flexibility of erythrocytes and veno-occlusive disorders (Bookchin and Lew, 1996) . Decreased flexibility or deformability of erythrocytes may contribute directly to increased cell fragility and rupture or promote clearance of deformed erythrocytes by splenic macrophages, while veno-occlusive disease has the potential to cause decreases in red cell mass through physical trauma and fragmentation. However, there is also evidence that in some severe cases of sickle cell disease there may be an increase in reticulocyte counts that are inappropriate for the magnitude of the decrease in red cell mass, suggesting a concurrent mechanism causing suppressed or ineffective erythropoiesis (Wu et al., 2005; Bookchin and Lew, 1996) . Oxidative stress on erythroid precursors may also contribute to ineffective erythropoiesis in some severe cases of sickle cell disease (Fibach and Rachmilewitz, 2008) .",

For example, although the primary effect of lead toxicity is impairment of heme synthesis, lead may also cause hemolysis. The mechanism of lead-induced hemolysis has not been fully determined, but interference with the erythrocyte membrane sodium/ potassium transporter may be involved (Bloom and Brandt, 2008) . Copper toxicity causes hemolysis as well, possibly through inhibition of many enzymes involved in glycolysis resulting in decreased intracellular ATP (Boulard et al., 1972) . Envenomation from multiple animals is reported to cause hemolysis. Envenomation by snakes, such as rattlesnakes and coral snakes, can cause hemolysis through phospholipase A2 activity, which may cause direct hemolysis or liberate hemolysins such as lysolethicin, or through complement-mediated hemolysis (Arce-Bejarano et al., 2014; Tambourgi and van den Berg, 2014; Walton et al., 1997) .",

Due to the loss of whole blood during hemorrhage, decreases in red cell mass are usually accompanied by proportionate decreases in albumin and globulin concentrations. The decreases in plasma proteins tend to be less pronounced with internal hemorrhage because the lost proteins may be resorbed in lymph and returned to blood (Stockham and Scott, 2008b) . Cases of internal hemorrhage are typically not associated with iron deficiency. However, prolonged external blood loss may cause depletion of total body iron. Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by small erythrocytes with a decrease in MCV and erythrocytes that contain less hemoglobin with a decrease in MCHC, and may be classified as a microcytic, hypochromic anemia. Hemoglobin synthesis plays a role in inhibiting erythrocyte division, and when sufficient iron is not available for heme production, there is loss of the inhibitory effect resulting in more cell divisions and microcytes (Stohlman et al., 1963) . Hypochromasia of the erythrocytes is due to the lower than normal hemoglobin content due to decreased production of heme. Morphologic erythrocyte changes that accompany iron deficiency anemia include visual microcytosis and hypochromasia, keratocytes and schistocytes from physical damage to the more fragile erythrocytes, and sometimes codocytes (also called target cells) that have a thin rim of pink-staining hemoglobin and a small central area of hemoglobin with a ring of pallor in between, typical of erythrocytes with less hemoglobin present relative to the amount of membrane. In chronic iron deficiency, increases in reticulocyte counts and microscopic polychromasia may be lower than expected for a regenerative anemia due to loss of RNA during the extended maturation phase of erythrocyte production caused by decreased hemoglobin content (Burkhard et al., 2001) .",

Traumatic rupture of the spleen may also cause significant acute internal blood loss. Decreases in red cell mass due to acute hemorrhage are typically due to dilution of remaining blood from shifting of intracellular fluid to extracellular fluid in an attempt to preserve blood volume and therefore tissue perfusion (Stockham and Scott, 2008b) . Dilution of red cell mass may also be observed following administration of intravenous fluids to replace blood volume. A detectable increase in reticulocyte count is expected 3-4 days following the acute event in a patient with normally functioning bone marrow. Damage to blood vessels that results in hemorrhage also may occur secondary to ulcerative or neoplastic conditions. In dogs, rupture of splenic hemangiosarcoma is a common cause of internal blood loss into the abdomen (hemoabdomen). Ulceration of the gastrointestinal system may lead to blood loss into feces, which can be observed as black, tarry feces (melena) if the ulceration occurs in the small intestines or as frank blood if the ulceration occurs in the large intestines.",

Blood is collected through the studies mainly for toxicokinetic or pharmacokinetic analysis, but also for analysis of hematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry profiles.

In experimentally infected Cebus paella monkeys, the acute phase of Chagas disease was reported to cause normocytic, normochromic anemia (Rosner et al., 1988) , typical of a nonregenerative anemia. Experimentally infected mice demonstrated bone marrow suppression with decreases in red cell mass as well as decreases in leukocyte and platelet counts (Marcondes et al., 2000) .

Parvovirus may result in transient pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in humans (Van Horn et al., 1986) . Cell-mediated suppression of erythropoiesis resulting in PRCA has also been reported with viral hepatitis (Wilson et al., 1980) and Epstein-Barr virus infection (Socinski et al., 1984) . Although HIV infection can result in decreases in red cell mass through various mechanisms, direct infection of erythroid precursors appears to contribute to suppressed erythropoiesis (Evans and Scadden, 2000) . In cats, a membrane protein of feline leukemia virus has been associated with decreased growth of CFU-E (Wellman et al., 1984) . Flavivirus infection, such as dengue, may also result in decreases in red cell mass and reticulocyte counts through bone marrow suppression (La Russa and Innis, 1995) .",

The decreases in red cell mass observed with ACD are generally mild, and are generally normocytic, normochromic, indicating no changes in MCV or MCHC, respectively. ACD may occur through shortening of erythrocyte lifespans, alterations in iron metabolism, a blunted response of erythroid precursors to EPO, and decreased EPO production. Altered erythrocyte lifespans in patients with ACD may be related to increased macrophagic clearance of erythrocytes from circulation through unknown mechanisms (Ganz, 2016) .

ACD from impaired iron metabolism is associated with numerous inflammatory, infectious, and even neoplastic conditions. ACD may also cause altered EPO responsiveness or decreased EPO production. Decreased responsiveness of erythroid precursors to EPO is cytokine-mediated, and has been associated with increases in TNFa, IL-1, and interferons (Johnson et al., 1989 (Johnson et al., , 1990 Raefsky et al., 1985) that may commonly be associated with inflammatory conditions. Decreased EPO production may also be cytokine-mediated, and has been reported with increases in TGFb, TNFa, and IL-1 (Faquin et al., 1992; Jelkmann et al., 1992) .

Bone marrow examination typically reveals an absence of erythroid precursors (erythroid aplasia) or low numbers of the earliest stages of erythroid precursors (erythroid hypoplasia) (Young, 2016) . PRCA in people may be caused by antibodies that bind antigens on the earliest erythroid precursors or even antibodies that bind EPO and prevent EPO-dependent erythropoiesis, but it has also been attributed to clonal T-cell disorders (Stockham and Scott, 2008b) . PRCA in dogs has been associated with IgG that inhibit erythropoiesis (Weiss, 1986) . PRCA may also be caused by inherited genetic defect in people. Inherited PRCA in people is called Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and often has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with defects in genes encoding ribosomal proteins (Young, 2016) . Macrocytosis, or increased numbers of large erythrocytes with increases in MCV, may be observed and is consistent with impaired EPO-dependent erythropoiesis (Young, 2016; Ohene-Abuakwa et al., 2005) . 12.11.3.2.2.4.3 Aplastic anemia Aplastic anemia is a condition associated with decreases in all cellular blood components (pancytopenia), including decreases in red cell mass with concurrent decreases in reticulocyte counts. Upon examination, the bone marrow classically had severe hypocellularity of hematopoietic cells or an absence of hematopoietic precursors the marrow cavities filled by mostly adipocytes and some stromal elements. Aplastic anemia is thought to be most commonly immunemediated (Young et al., 2006) , and may be frequently associated with cytotoxic T-cells that become autoreactive (Segel and Lichtman, 2016) . However, there are also cases of inherited aplastic anemia, most commonly Fanconi anemia associated with genetic mutations that impair DNA repair resulting in pancytopenia developing around 5-10 years of age in people (Segel and Lichtman, 2016) . A form of aplastic anemia associated with bone marrow depletion or hypocellularity of hematopoietic tissue and gelatinous transformation of marrow cavity fat has been reported with anorexia nervosa in people (Abella et al., 2002) and with severe food restriction in rats (Moriyama et al., 2008) .",

Deficiencies in folate and cobalamin also cause ineffective erythropoiesis due to defects in DNA synthesis, as discussed with folate and cobalamin deficiencies as a cause of deceases in neutrophil counts. In people, folate and cobalamin deficiencies result in megaloblastic anemia, characterized by larger than normal erythroid precursors in the bone marrow that have more cytoplasm with lower nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios than in normal erythroid precursors and asynchronous cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation (Green, 2016) . Megaloblastic erythrocytes may also be observed in circulation, and basophilic stippling or Howell-Jolly bodies may also be observed (Green, 2016) . In people, anemia attributable to a deficiency in cobalamin (vitamin B 12 ) may also be called pernicious anemia. In dogs and cats, megaloblastic erythroid cells may be observed in the bone marrow but may not be observed in blood (Stockham and Scott, 2008b) .",

In cases of hypothyroidism, several mechanisms may be contributing to the decreases in red cell mass. Decreased folate or cobalamin concentrations secondary to the hypothyroidism leading to ineffective erythropoiesis, decreased tissue oxygen demand leading to decreased EPO and lower baseline red cell mass, and ACD may contribute to the mild decreases in red cell mass observed with hypothyroidism (Ottesen et al., 1995; Hines et al., 1968; Stockham and Scott, 2008b; Mehmet et al., 2012) . Mild decreases in red cell mass without apparent changes in reticulocyte counts have been associated with hypoadrenocorticism. This may be due to a decrease in glucocorticoids, and the loss of the apparent proerythropoietic stimulation of glucocorticoids (Stockham and Scott, 2008b) . Hyperestrogenism, which occurs with some ovarian or testicular neoplasms, may result in bone marrow toxicity and suppression of erythropoiesis, particularly in dogs (Sontas et al., 2009) .",

Subsequent stages of differentiation are megakaryoblasts, followed by promegakaryocytes, then megakaryocytes. These latter stages may be recognized during light microscopic evaluation of bone marrow. Extensions of megakaryocyte cytoplasm (proplatelets) enter sinuses, or the microvasculature of the bone marrow. Within sinuses, these proplatelets are detached from the megakaryocyte by the shear forces of blood, after which they are further fragmented into platelets (Harvey, 2012; Junt et al., 2007) . Thrombopoiesis, as well as megakaryopoiesis, is predominantly stimulated by TPO.

Antiplatelet antibodies may directly target platelet antigens, such as the glycoprotein integrin a IIb b 3(GPIIb-IIIa) that plays a major role in platelet aggregation (He et al., 1994) , antigens exposed or formed on platelet surfaces by infectious agents, or infectious agent-targeted antibodies that cross-react with normally expressed platelet surface antigens or membrane components such as phospholipid (Stockham and Scott, 2008c) . Antibody-bound platelets may be phagocytosed and destroyed by splenic, bone marrow, or hepatic macrophages, or may be associated with complement-mediated destruction or stimulation of phagocytosis (Diz-K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckkaya and L\u00f3pez, 2016; Russell, 2010) .

Bone marrow suppression may occur in association with infectious agents that can directly infect hematopoietic precursors such as immunodeficiency viruses in various species, parvoviruses, distemper virus in dogs, and feline leukemia virus in cats (Russell, 2010; Stockham and Scott, 2008c; Scaradavou, 2002) . Chronic ehrlichiosis in dogs has also been reported to cause bone marrow hypoplasia, although the mechanism remains unclear (Stockham and Scott, 2008c) . However, decreases in platelet counts attributable to infectious agents may have contributions from mechanisms other than bone marrow suppression, such as peripheral consumption or immune-mediated destruction. Hyperestrogenism associated with testicular or ovarian neoplasia may also cause general bone marrow suppression, and dogs appear to be particularly sensitive to this effect (Sontas et al., 2009) .",

Antiplatelet antibodies may be formed through various mechanisms. Penicillin and some cephalosporins cause platelet destruction through hapten-type or drug-dependent antibody production, while quinidine and some NSAIDS can cause immune-mediated platelet destruction through the formation of antibodies that only bind platelets when the soluble drug is present (Aster and Bougie, 2007) . Some drugs that inhibit the platelet glycoprotein a IIb b 3(GPIIb-IIIa) may lead to platelet expression of a new antigen due to conformation changes to the glycoprotein complexes that can then be bound by antibodies; such drugs include tirofiban, roxifiban, and eptifibatide (Aster and Bougie, 2007; Aster, 2005) . Abciximab has been reported to cause drugspecific antibodies that cause decreases in platelet counts (Aster, 2005) . Xenobiotic-induced production of autoantibodies that bind platelets, or drug-independent antibodies, has been attributed to procainamide and gold-based compound administration (Aster and Bougie, 2007) . In humans, immune-complex type antibodies are classically associated with heparin therapy, and are due to the interaction of heparin, a platelet granule component, and platelet factor 4 (PF4) (Aster and Bougie, 2007; Visentin and Liu, 2007; Arepally and Ortel, 2006) .",
