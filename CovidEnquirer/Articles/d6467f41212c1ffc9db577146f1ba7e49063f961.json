            "text": "Distemper leukoencephalitis is a disease caused by the canine distemper virus (CDV) infection. It is a demyelinating disease affecting mainly the white matter of the cerebellum and areas adjacent to the fourth ventricle; the enzymes of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) group, especially MMP-2 and MMP-9 have a key role in the myelin basic protein fragmentation and in demyelination, as well as in leukocyte traffic into the nervous milieu. To evaluate the involvement of MMPs during subacute distemper leukoencephalitis, we measured the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by zymography in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the cerebellum of 14 dogs naturally infected with CDV and 10 uninfected dogs. The infected dogs presented high levels of pro-MMP-2 in the CSF and elevated levels of pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 in the cerebellar tissue. Active MMP-2 was detected in the CSF of some infected dogs. As active MMP-2 and MMP-9 are required for cellular migration across the blood-brain barrier and any interference between MMPs and their inhibitors may result in an amplification of demyelination, this study gives additional support to the involvement of MMPs during subacute distemper leukoencephalitis and suggests that MMP-2 and MMP-9 may take part in the brain inflammatory changes of this disease.",

An imbalance in MMPs and their inhibitors (TIMPs) has been suggested as a cause of lesion initiation and progression during canine distemper virus infection (Miao et al., 2003; Gr\u00f6ters et al., 2005) . Green et al. (2011) , working with human CSF, demonstrated that the expression of MMPs/TIMPs in the CSF during CNS infections is determined by the etiologic agent, and that MMP-2 and MMP-9 are especially involved in inflammatory cell migration into the neuropil due to their ability to digest type-IV collagen, which is the major component of the basal membrane that involves the capillaries (Rosemberg, 2002) . Further, MMPs and TIMPs, together with other classical biomarkers, have been used to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from vascular dementia (Bjerke et al., 2011) , but biomarkers do not usually have relevance in clinical animal diagnosis and prognosis. Therefore, with this study, we aimed to detect MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the CSF and in cerebellar tissue by gelatin-zymography, as well as to identify these MMPs and inflammatory cells in the cerebellum using immunohistochemistry.",

Fragments from the cerebellum and cerebellar peduncles were macerated at 4 \u2022 C in the extraction buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl 2 , 0.05% (w/v) Brij-35, plus a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, EDTA-free 11 873 580 001, Roche). Samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u2022 C, and the supernatants were collected. For CSF zymography, there was no pre-treatment of the samples, but centrifugation was performed. The total protein content was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (23225, Pierce Biotechnology). The gelatinolytic activity of these samples was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gelatin zymography, according to the method previously described by Machado et al. (2010) and by Marangoni et al. (2011) . MMP identity and normalization between gels was achieved with a sample of canine mammary adenocarcinoma previously standardized with human recombinant MMP-2 (PF037, Calbiochem) and MMP-9 (PF038, Calbiochem). The gels were digitalized and the integrated density of the bands, expressed as arbitrary units, was calculated using the open-access software ImageJ 1.46r (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij).",

Negative control sections were performed by replacing the primary antibody with PBS. Lymph node tissue was used as a positive control for inflammatory cells. Tissue samples were examined by light microscopy and the positive-stained area was measured by computerized image-analysis software (Image-Pro Plus 6.1, Media Cybernetics) as per Melo and Machado (2011) .

            "text": "Since the pathogenesis of distemper leukoencephalitis is phase-dependent, the source of MMPs within the CNS may vary according to the time of infection. MMP-9, MMP-14 and TIMP-1 are expressed mostly in astrocytes and in macrophages/microglia in initial lesions, while infiltrating lymphocytes as well as activated macrophages/microglia are the main source of these components in advanced distemper leukoencephalitis (Gr\u00f6ters et al., 2005) . The production of active MMP-2 and MMP-9 by T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells is required for their migration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and their subsequent invasion of the CNS compartment (Rosemberg, 2002; Stamatovic et al., 2008) . By immunohistochemistry, we detected MMP-2 and MMP-9 preferentially in mononuclear cells. Nevertheless, the role of MMPs within the CNS may start prior to leukocyte infiltration. In canine inflammatory brain lesions, microglial cells expressed a variety of MMPs and TIMPs mRNAs, including MMP-2 and MMP-9; and some dogs also presented MMP-2 activity in brain-zymography (Stein et al., 2011) . Further, in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis (TME), a virus-induced model of multiple sclerosis, after stereotaxic injection of activated MMP-3, -9, and -12 into the caudal cerebellar peduncle of adult mice, the authors noticed a focally extensive primary demyelination, before the infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as a reduction in the number of oligodendrocytes (Hansmann et al., 2012) . In demyelination, MMPs also act in myelin basic protein fragmentation (Shiryaev et al., 2009) .",

By zymography, there was no way of detecting a constant profile of MMPs in the CSF and the cerebellar tissue of the dogs and establishing a secure biomarker for the subacute inflammatory phase of the CDV infection; however, pro-MMP-2 was present in most of the CSF samples and pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 were increased in the cerebellum. The MMPs/TIMPs imbalance may contribute to the complex mechanisms enrolled in distemper leukoencephalitis and therapies based on metalloproteinase inhibitors for dogs may be an additional aid to help in the recovery or stop the progression of the lesions in animals in the acute phase of disease.",
