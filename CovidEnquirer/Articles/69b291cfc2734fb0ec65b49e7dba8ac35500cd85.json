Results showed nephropathogenic IBV strains 885 and QX induced greater apoptosis in CEKC than M41, which induced greater apoptosis in TOCs compared to 885 and QX. Elevated IIR is associated with tissue tropism of different IBV strains. Compared to M41, 885 and QX caused greater induction of toll like receptor 3 (TLR3), melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 (MDA5) and interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2) in CEKC. In contrast, M41 infection caused greater expression of these genes than 885 or QX in TOCs. In summary, greater levels of apoptosis and elevated levels of TLR3, MDA5 and IFN-\u03b2 expression are associated with increased pathogenicity of IBV strains in renal and tracheal tissues.",

Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) continues to cause serious economic losses to global chicken production. Along with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and velogenic Newcastle disease (ND), IB is the most economically important viral respiratory disease affecting poultry industry worldwide (Cook et al., 2012) . Vaccination has been considered as the most reliable approach for IBV control (Meeusen et al., 2007) however current vaccines have proved to be inadequate due to constant emergence of new variant viruses (De Wit, 2000; de Wit et al., 2011) . Concurrent circulation of both classic and variant IBVs has been identified in most parts of the world, raising major challenges to the current IBV prevention and control strategies.",

While all IBV strains appear to initially infect chickens via the respiratory tract, vireamia enables spread to secondary sites for further replication and persistence. An example is IBV strain M41, which replicates primarily in the respiratory tract and subsequently spreads and replicates in a range of other tissues. In contrast, strains of IBV such as strain QX and IS/885/00 are primarily nephropathogenic (Benyeda et al., 2009; Meir et al., 2004) . IS/885/00, referred to as a nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV), was first isolated from a severe outbreak of renal disease in several broiler farms in Israel (Meir et al., 2004) and has been detected in many other Middle East countries (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2012; Awad et al., 2014; Mahmood et al., 2011) . IBV QX was first isolated in China from chickens with proventriculitis (YuDong et al., 1998) but was later found to cause renal, (Ganapathy et al., 2012; Liu and Kong, 2004; Terregino et al., 2008; Worthington et al., 2008) , respiratory and reproductive lesions (Ducatez et al., 2009; Terregino et al., 2008) in chicken flocks in Europe, Asia, Africa and Middle East (Beato et al., 2005; Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2006; Gough et al., 2008; Jackwood, 2012) .",

While the ability to bind to susceptible host cells is the first step in the viral life cycle, host innate immune responses could also be a major contributing factor to the pathological outcome of IBV infection. Variant IBVs continually emerge and the host determinants of IBV pathogenicity are not yet fully understood. Early cellular and innate immune responses of virus infected cells in vitro could act as useful indicators for predicting the pathological outcome of viral infection in vivo. For example, the three different genotypes of Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) produce distinct host response patterns in chicken spleenocytes, which is useful to differentiate the NDV genotypes (Hu et al., 2012) . In order to establish the characteristic host response to predict the tissue tropism and pathogenicity of IBVs, we investigated apoptosis and innate immune responses in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells and tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) following infection with IS/885/00-like, QX-like and M41 IBV strains.",

It was observed that expression of LGP2 (Fig. 4A ) and MDA5 (Fig. 4B ) was significantly upregulated at 9 hpi but down-regulated at 24 hpi in IBV infected CEK cells compared with mock infected cells (po0.05).

The modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins during IBV infection has also been postulated to be under the regulation of signalling pathways such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase/Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways (Fung and Liu, 2014; Zhong et al., 2012a) .

TLR7 was not significantly affected by IBV infection in CEK cells. The end products of the TLR3 signalling pathway are the production of anti-viral type I interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and -\u03b2, whereas TLR7 activation results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Guillot et al., 2005) . Concurrent with TLR3 activation, we found a significant up-regulation of IFN\u03b2, but not IFN\u03b1 mRNA expression, at 9 h after IBV infection in CEK cells. Likewise, the lack of TLR7 induction correlated with no change in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-1\u03b2, IL-8 and NLRP3 in IBV infected CEK cells. In contrast to our findings, a recent study found that IFN-\u03b2 transcription was not found in CEK cells until 12 h after infection with IBV M41 at MOI of 0.1 (Kint et al., 2015) . This difference may have been due to variation in the MOI used and origin of cells.",

Corona virus nucelocapsid (N) protein has been shown to interfere with the 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase/RNaseL (2 0 -5 0 OAS) activation, which is responsible for Type I IFN induction and can also inhibit the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via global translational shutdown (Ye et al., 2007; Zhong et al., 2012b) . However, MDA5 and IFN-\u03b2 expression was also up-regulated in TOCs at 24 h after IBV infection suggesting a sustained immune response in TOCs compared with CEK cells.

However, recent evidence suggests TLR3 contributes to pathogenic effects of viral infections. TLR3 mediates West Nile virus entry into the brain, causing lethal encephalitis (Wang et al., 2004 ) and contributes to a detrimental inflammatory response to influenza virus infection in mice, resulting in acute pneumonia (Le Goffic et al., 2006) . A recent study has shown that MDA5, but not TLR3, is involved in the sensing of IBV (Kint et al., 2015) . However, higher mRNA levels of MDA5 and TLR3 correlated with the in vivo pathogenicity of the IBV strains used in this study, such that the nephropathogenic and tracheotropic IBVs induced much higher levels in CEK cells and TOCs, respectively. It is possible that MDA5 activation is a protective antiviral host response against the virus whereas TLR3 contributes to some detrimental effects from viral infection. The precise role of MDA5 and TLR3 in host defence against IBV infection and/or disease pathogenesis is not yet fully understood and hence, warrants further in-depth studies.",

LGP2 functions as a negative regulator by interfering with the recognition of viral RNA by RIG-I and MDA5 (Yoneyama et al., 2005) . MDA5 is IFN-inducible (Kang et al., 2004) , so once an IFN response is triggered, this innate antiviral loop initiates autoamplification of MDA5 until the natural inhibitor LGP2 is induced (Yoneyama et al., 2005) . However, we found that the expression of LGP2, MDA5 and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels were down-regulated at 24 h after IBV infection, possibly due to the virus induced host gene shutoff. In agreement with our findings, a recent study also reported a down-regulation of TLR3, IL-1\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 expression in IBV infected chicken tracheas at 12 hpi (Kameka et al., 2014) .

(1976) did not find marked differences when compared three strains of IBV on the basis of their effect on tracheal cilia. Raj and Jones (1996) also reported little difference among several IBV strains using measurement of ciliary activity as a criterion for damage to the tracheal epithelium. However, Abd El Rahman et al. (2009) has revealed that the strains differed in their efficiency to infect the tracheal epithelium. Infection by Beaudette and QX resulted in a larger number of infected cells compared to Itlay-02 and 4/91 strains, when tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) were infected with the same amount of virus (Abd El Rahman et al., 2009) . In summary, our study found that greater levels of apoptosis and elevated expression of TLR3, MDA5 and IFN-\u03b2 is associated with increased pathogenicity of IBVs in kidney (CEK cells) and respiratory (TOCs) tissues. The findings of this study using CEK cells and TOCs raise a strong possibility that host innate immune response could aid generation of a predictive prognosis for the tissue tropism of novel IBV strains. However, further studies are needed to confirm the association between pathogenicity and host response in vivo and to establish the mechanisms underlying such responses. Relative mRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR normalised to 18S rRNA. Graph values are the mean of three biological replicates with error bars as standard error, and are expressed as fold change relative to the mocked-infected group. Different letters indicate that the differences between groups at that time point are significant (po 0.05).",
